I'm in a 9 month relationship and I would be broken if that happened to me. You didn't mention how long you were going out for (not that it matters to this question).

I know where your coming from and I don't blame you for your neediness or timidity; however, its time for the boy to die and for the man to arise. Your job as a man is to lead, protect, and of course love your woman. You have to be decisive, walk tall with a felling of certainty & pride. Start making decisions & stop looking at others for approval.. as I said your job is to lead, NO more of that whiny little *****.<br>  <br>  When you'll incorporate the things I mentioned & transform into a real man, I grantee it will enhance every aspect of your life including your love life, and you'll have lines of women wanting to subscribe to your manly love. Once you dig through all the superficial bullshit you end up with the inevitability that women in general want men that are simply men.. real men!<br>  <br>  Good luck brother!
AA10325474	its up to the amount of money dude, if u pay enough u get everything....if u give a girl 1 million bucks or lets say 10 million bucks for one call....she will do it.........ok, 9 in 10 will do it...and i guess so would i lol.|`|iOa7rriGaa	It doesn't matter weather it's in person or over the phone either way it's still degrading and wrong who in the hell that is in their right mind wants to be known as a slut oh but it's ok because I only do it over the phone. No it's not worth any money at any price you could offer me all the money in the world and I'd never do that ever.|`|DzPH3QRQaa	You should be yourself, as I always say :)<br>  I don't think it's a good idea, lol<br>  But it's their choice, so I have no complaints or grudges against them :)|`|Pwg8IUbTaa	What !!!  I am not sure what your saying or asking. I would never work as you ask as a slut through the phone  regardless of Money. I think a little higher of myself than that.

For one, you are not talking in person with anyone, nor can they see, touch, or feel you. You are considered a 'phone actress'. It would be a different story all together if a person were making plans to go out and actually meet and become intimate with someone they had spoken to. But, if you keep it at a professional level as a 'phone actress', and nothing more, then; No. You are not a slut in my book. Furthermore, at least you are willing to work. Some single moms do phone-work at home simply because they can remain at home. Babysitters are expensive and it sure beats those moms who are dependent on our welfare system.|`|e2veAx9Zaa	Do you mean a professional phone sex chick?  If so that is not wrong at all. One reason is because it just over the phone and not in person. Also, it is safer and less demeaning.

I hope you will be stationed so you can be together.<br>  what an exciting day!|`|VYCLwKwNaa	First, talk with your fiance about what kind of wedding you want.<br>  Then, see who else wants to help. Sometimes the mothers, aunts and sisters REALLY want to be involved. So, you will want to decide what you would like them to do. Sometimes, you can count on them to do almost everything. (flowers, food, etc.) But only do this after you figure out what kind of wedding you want, so that the wedding doesn't become something else.<br>  The most important thing is that you are getting married and building a life with this man. So, you and he should be talking a lot about what that life will be like.<br>  The ceremony, dress, party, etc. can be as simple or as involved as you want to make it. Some people just have the preacher, close family, some nice clothes, two rings, and a simple party. That saves a lot of money. Every child in my family was married at someone's home or in an outdoor setting, wearing clothes that they already had, and the family made the food for the reception. The only costs were the preacher and marriage certificate, the cake and the rings. And every marriage is still going strong, 20+ years later.<br>  If you have the dress/shoes/undies/makeup/hair for you, buy rings, and then get some nice nightwear or clothes for whatever honeymoon you want to have, that should do it. The important thing is to be relaxed and enjoy your leave with him, not to get all tired and stressed out.Let your family take care of the details and then celebrate with them!<br>  Congratulations on your marriage. You have our gratitude for your service to our country!|`|yF1t5n24aa	Why are you asking me? I'm the only one online right now and <br>  I haven't been on a date in over 4 years.
2COaydcfaa	my mum used to take her slipper off and stair at me if i did something wrong. That was enough to curb my naughtiness when I was small. At school they used a thick belt that was tongs at the end.<br>  <br>  As a parent I  have never used corporal punishment. I used to just feel angry and my kids seen the look on my face and would behave. Bless them.|`|Ta2lNKUVaa	I am not English, though I have lived there before, and my parents and even stepmom have never used physical punishment.|`|AA12050428	Yes corporal punishment in UK schools was banned way back but I think that was a backward step, Just look at the number of thugs around in the UK? <br>  As a teacher I found the class bully was soon reduced to tears when you kept him behind and had a little chat, no violence was needed just the withdrawal of his pals.|`|X3QbcIUwaa	I have never experience the slipper myself, but some of my friends have and they turned out alright.<br>  <br>  My mum used to punish me by taking away privileges and when I was in primary, our teacher would pinch our ears slightly(never mine, I was a good student).<br>  <br>  We grew up respecting adults, not because of the punishment.<br>  <br>  The community was really involved. For example if a neighboor saw you skipping school or smoking, they would take you by the ear straight to your mum. This way no one messed up.<br>  <br>  I am really pro community working together for raising children.|`|695cbbcba51ceed2403cffaf9486d103aa	In my childhood days (a long time ago) the physical punishment of children, at school and at home, was very common. At home, my Mum would use either her hand, a slipper or a tawse to spank my bottom. Of course it stung, but I have not been aware of any after effects other than my trying to avoid the bad behaviour that prompted it. In fairness, I have to say that Mum never hit me in anger as a spontaneous reaction to something I had done.|`|nN2pIykfaa	the only thing viol;ence towards children achieves is to teach them that its ok to use violence to get what you want.|`|ufdFei1jaa	Using violence on a child is NEVER the answer.........edit....Did you know that slapping a childs hand can cause arthritis in later life.

Im not saying beat your kids, but when they are being stupid i believe they sometimes require a pat. you know what i mean?|`|eO1o511daa	Don't think they do, but should.

4c5510a6e0a36cd4c20f27a55e5609dbaa	Let him deal with this emotional issue first. You can't cheer up him in this state. But be there for him, when he needs someone to talk about it.|`|WBbJQNDoaa	Lie to him... Sounds like people have been doing that ever since he was born.|`|ge5x9NHxaa	You need to make out time and sit him down and gradual convince him that he did not kill his mum.

O3EtP4vOaa	The thing is you are 26 and she is 21.  She probably is just dating around not getting to serious with anyone.  With that being said all you can do is tell her how you feel and see what she says.  If she is over it then let it go and move on.  You will find someone else even though it doesnt seem like it now.|`|fvN18yvGaa	You acted like a twat thus breaking any future bond she thought she could have with u, its her call..|`|9FlUlbYXaa	This is why it is unwise to date people from work.  Obsession is nice but unhealthy.  You should change jobs, start seeing other people, and getting involved in new activities.  You'll be too busy adjusting to think of her so much.  Feel better...|`|mFInMKSaaa	Ok, dude.  Here is what you do.  You go get Einstein's Theory of Reletivity on ebook.  It won't take long until things are put in perspective.

You seem to be pretty old to be in your first relationship (love). I'm sure you would of asked yourself if you really loved her and you are probably telling yourself yes.<br>  <br>  I'd say that the more you chase her now, the farther apart you will become. It looks like you really love her and really want her back. Just wait for a new girl to come along. If she meant that much to you and you shared a lot with her, ask yourself how you think she feels about you. Maybe there might be a little light left.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry i confused myself writing this as i'm not sure what could happen. Good luck. I hope u get her back|`|KFjwyAIUaa	Gather yourself and look at the situation as a life experience. You will move on and find another girl. Just don't make the same mistakes you have made in the past. If you are meant to be with this girl, then it will naturally happen. Forcing things can turn situations ugly real fast.|`|DWCBzH4xaa	Trust  me  i  have    been  in  a  worse  situation and  felt  if  I  couldnt  have  this   girl   life  was  not  worth  living. I   lived   with  her   and  I   even    stayed  although   on a weekend  she  would  be   having  sex  with  other  men    in  the   same  house  we  shared  with  another   man   cause  he   had  more   money  than   me . She  was  not  working  and  in  Uni .i  did  all  I  could  paid  all   bills   spent  on  her  told  her   how  much  I  loved  her, One  day I  did  somfn  different  I  gave  myself  to  Christ  and  woke  up  and  realised   life  is  not  about  one  person. I   packed  my  backs and  left . I  didnt  realise the   harm  i  was  doing to  myself  no  wonder  she  lost respect. If  you  persist  you  will   seriously    make  things  worse. Please  move  on     you  will find   that there  are  even  nicer  and  more   beautiful  girls   who  will  love  u  as  well and  cherish u.  at times  things   dont  work   out   cause  it   was not  meant to  be  and  something  better    is there for u<br>  take care
dqPksiFYaa	maybe she's really busy or thinking of you. What to do to you.
X3QbcIUwaa	Oh my love, that sounds terrible.<br>  <br>  Your mom needs help, get her if possible to see a doctor/counsellor.<br>  <br>  You really need to distance yourself. You are not responsible for your mum, she is.<br>  <br>  You are an amazing young lady, look after yourself, you have so many things going on, focus on you.<br>  <br>  I know it may sound cruel, but you really need to stay away from anything that can be hurtful. <br>  <br>  She is not acting like a mum, but like a child.<br>  <br>  It's awful that she is so negative and hurtful to you, she should be proud. I would love one day to have a child like you.<br>  <br>  Don't feel guilty or bad, just think of yourself.<br>  <br>  Go to speak to your college counsellor and maybe other family members. Explain the situation and ask for support.<br>  <br>  Due to your age, it is so not your responsibility.<br>  <br>  I am proud of you and so should you.<br>  <br>  You deserve the best, so stay away and focus on you. <br>  <br>  All the best|`|kToZcmOgaa	tell your mother to go **** herself and get her own ******* life and tell her to stop living your life and slap that ***** back into reality|`|GokA3YGkaa	Firstly, I think you might benefit from seeing a campus counselor for a few sessions to be able to vent and have soomeoneto touch base with who is professionally prepared to understand your situation from a student standpoint.<br>  <br>  I would tell your mom that you are working hard to be a successful student, going to classes..doing homework..and working to make ends meet.  Do you have financial aid to pay your school or do you work?  If you work, then explain that you have to work weekends for school, maybe?<br>  <br>  Let her know that your focus is on school and preparing yourself for the future.  You cannot involve yourself socially with classmates and potential connections (networking) if you spend alll free time back at home.<br>  <br>  Plus, tell her that when she calls you and talks to you the way she does that it actually makes you want to visit less because it doesn't feel nice, that it bothers you and feels disrespectful.<br>  <br>  Tell her that you do not feel she understoods or supports your goals.<br>  <br>  I would tell her that you feel like she needs to look at what is really bothering her about you not coming home.  Tell her a lot of parents have a difficult time adjusting when their kids move to the next phase in life (this is a better way to say it than "move on") but that she needs to find a way to accept it.<br>  <br>  Tell her that yuo do not feel that the words and ways she chooses to communicate with you are constructive ways or productive and that if she were calmer, fairer and more respectful in her communication, you would be able to hear what she is trying to say much better.<br>  <br>  I don't know if all of this will help or apply but it's what I could thinjk of.<br>  <br>  Priority one is yourself and your education.<br>  <br>  Priority two is finding a way to establish a healthier relationship with your mom.  She might not know how to do this and maybe you can work together with her so that she can be less hostile (verbally).<br>  <br>  Oh and if she doesn't try and change or continues to be abusive verbally, then you might want to consider a break from communicating with her.  Have your boyfriend talk with his boss about the situation, at least enough to know that the mom has threatened to come and that he hopes that doesn[t happen.. and be prepared if it does to call the police to intervene.  You don[t have to press charges, she deson['t have to go to jail but they can come to tell her she is not welcome to behnave that way at his work.<br>  <br>  Below is a link to a list of features that define verbal abuse.  Sometimes it is good to look at this to see how maybe some other behaviors were actually abusive and you didn't realize itbecause it's so close to home and the environment  you were raised.  It says "Your partner" at the top of the list but the list is common in other relationships, too, as you will see.  So look down the list.. and check it out.<br>  <br>  Also, if you want more ongoing counseling than the few sessions your campus will provide, ask about free or affordable counseling from your campus counseling center.  They usually have a list of places.  Sometimes they only cost 5 dollars a session and you might end up wanting to go 2-3 times a month.<br>  <br>  <br>  Food for thought.  Good luck!|`|WniOOchkaa	You didn't really specifiy what kind of condition your mother is in.  If she is sick or disabled and not able to take care of those things then try to help her to the best of your ability.  If she's plenty able to clean, run errands, ect, then let her do it.  It sounds like she thinks your very mature and trusts you alot so maybe that's why she always uses her as her "vent". Perhaps you can recommend e-mail to your mother.  Just tell her or send an e-mail explaining that your sorry you can't spend as much time with her as she'd like becuase your very busy with college and work.  If she starts off "bad" in the e-mail just delete it and forget about it.  I can kinda understand your mother wanting help if she were supporting you, but it sounds like you've been on your own for a little while and you need to take care of your needs first.  I would maybe recommend going to your mothers for a few hours on Sunday evening so that she can't ask you to do too many errands since many places will not be open and it limits the time she can "boss" you around.  If she lives to far away to go for just a little while I would just plan maybe 1 weekend a month if you even want to do that.  I hope things get better for  you.|`|be062b491e24d9717129c7997e9864c1aa	Hello 'Wrongly Accused', I know where you are comming from. Your mother and my mother sound very similar. I am 38 yrs. old now, and unfortunately, my mother and I continue to be distant. I have to say one main thing that I seriously hope you are paying attention to. You have got to make 'YOU' happy. No one else is going to do it for you. The hardest (and scarriest if your mom is as bad as mine), thing you will probably have to do in life is stand up to your mother. I'm not saying you have to curse her or by any means get physical. But you DO need to take a firm stand! Let her know that you are hurting because of her, and that you have been for a very long time. And, that you will not tolerate being called such names. You may even have to be a little bit of a smart a** and say something like, 'Well mom, if I'm stupid then I guess your not the brightest light either. Because the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Does it'.  Be strong honey, it's easier said than done. But one day you are going to have to tell her how you feel and that it IS going to stop. You may as well get it done and over with. As far as your boyfriend; It is not her choice who you choose to love. You are the one that may spend the rest of your life with this young man, not her. Be happy sweetie. Please. Good luck. One more bit of advise, tell her when you are ready, but soon. Don't let these things come out during an argument, and if you continue to hold back and let these hurt feelings build up any further; Sooner than later, they will explode. Not a pretty sight.|`|lj3hNR9baa	You should tell her what you said here, and if she start acting up, verbally abuse her back then hang up the phone and don't make any contact with her for awhile so she has some time to think about what you said.

O3EtP4vOaa	lol.....I have tried to no end to be the nicest sweetest daughter in-law to my mother in-law and she jsut continues being psycho crazy towards me.  My husband and her have a very strained relationship, they always have, he has not lived with her since he was 11.  The only reason they have any relationship at all now is because I encourage him to not have any regrets if something were to happen to her.  Yet she continues to hate me for no reason.  I send b-day presents, x-mas presents and cards, when we move I sent her our change of address and my husband yells everytime that I am being to nice to her that she doesn;t deserve it.<br>  <br>  So no I hope all daughter inlaws are not horrible and I hope all mother inlaws are not horrible either, looks like we just got missed matched!|`|AA10408209	Are you sure that you are doing everything you can to have a good relationship with her?

CJzg0Jbkaa	Wow you sound like a really nice guy.. if she leaves you, she's stupid!! Just be yourself, and make sure you don't have any regrets. Do what you feel comfortable with- tell her things as you feel you need to. If i were in the same situation, i think it'd take me a little while to get over it all and to start to relax around her again. Do what feels natural, you' ve still got heaps of time to learn to love again. Don't let bad experiences get in the way of what could be amazing.|`|IRtvIophaa	i think u should take a chance and just open up to her when you love someone your giving that person a chance to break ur heart but i think thats what makes it exciting and not so boring because what they do is there choice and it dosen''t always end up bad it could turn into something really great, you just gotta show her that your giving her your ALL.|`|yxxGpJnDaa	Umm..i'll give U sum choices..rest Depends on you.<br>  1. just try to be normal friends with her.then gradually disclose your secrets.<br>  2.ask sum of your friends or her friends(if u noe) that what kind of a girl she is and what was her past love history<br>  3.Just chill out!! be her boyfriend and then if she leaves you get on sum1 else..thinking that she never was meant to be yours..<br>  <br>  hope this could help..!!
aDumNnqQaa	Oh, man! I took me like ages to read that.<br>  <br>  option 1. It depends, if you are a b**** you would just dump her and be competition.<br>  <br>  option 2. If you care you will get back to her because accidents happen in friendship.<br>  <br>  (the right option is option 2. well...at least the decent ppl will choose that option..)

A woman might wear a short skirt and show boobs, but be a virgin. A woman might wear jeans an a turtleneck and sneakers and have a different sex partner every night (and that wouldn't necessarily make her immoral or a bad person).<br>  <br>  You cannot know what someone's private behavior is, or what their personal values/morals are inside from what they are wearing.<br>  <br>  You find that mode of dress appealing, that's fine. Nothing wrong with that at all. ?|`|7MnJUjo0aa	Wow...the one dude is a little horny perv. -_-<br>  <br>  But as for your question, it actually depends. It doesn't mean they're bad/immoral ALL the time. In fact, the girl could possibly be insecure herself, and feel that she NEEDS to do that to feel better. You might actually make their day, you know? =]<br>  <br>  Just watch out for the ones who's behavior and things scream SLUT.

If this involves showing some skin than there is nothing wrong with that!

It's not acting slutty, there just isn't anyplace to hide those things. No harm in that...
mqV9TOv0aa	Grab your brother in front of your friend and tell him, "Grand-Ma was not a virgin!" He treats me the way I want to be treated, and you should back off a bit.

I think you should be able to date him but down the road, whatever happens between you two, will get around to your brother. Your brother will be protective of you , even if he loses his friend. Are you prepared for your private moments to be shared with your brother and friends? It may break up his friendship with his friend. Guys talk, especially if they are close. It depends on what you can handle and how this guys is if you start dating him. It may come down to choosing you over your brother.

Good luck.|`|AA10408209	I didn't even bother reading the details to this question because round-house kicking them all in the face is just great. lol.
qxgkhN8aaa	Hi Tessa, I think your b/f is not quite experience with it.<br>  I've heard people's sex lives were so good even after 12 years.<br>  I'm not so experience with sex either,<br>  but I do study a lots of sex magazines.<br>  And it do help as I knew which spot to touch and where to play around<br>  and erotic and excitement is a must.<br>  Wish I help.|`|Pwg8IUbTaa	Sounds like you have got into a rut with your b/f. But clearly you love him. Well there is going to be,I think, increasing strain on your realtionship,if your sex life does not get better fast. I would try and spice that area up,you know do different things and in different places.<br>  I hope it works out for you.|`|L4jMOVvPaa	Maby you should take a wee break. from sex and your selfs. it doesnt have to really long, just a 2 week thing i think would do.<br>  <br>  When you come back to each other dont just run into the bedroom but take it slowly like you would of done before and hope that the spark ignites once again.|`|gYDBdsWRaa	i have that same problem with my gf lol|`|COc5U2nJaa	Haii, i been where you are now before but in my story we broke up and yeah it killed me heaps, still does. But I'm not saying it will happen to you. There is a chance to make it better, you just gotta think how the passion first got on, what did yous guys do or talk about?<br>  <br>  Its not necessary to be TOGETHER to get back the passion between yous, its hard to explain but yeah. You will only know how that works once you break up cause you wont see it until the break up. But lets hope that doesn't happen. <br>  <br>  All the best xx.|`|BrZHHGGlaa	Well its clear to see that you two do love each other.But it seems that your love life is a little how you say......boring? you can always try ew positions if that does not arouse you or like start doing kinky stuff|`|QuEND8hxaa	Next time you see him show him this question.|`|AA11447210	You two have to work together to spice up not only your relationship but your bedroom activities. Find a new hobby or activity to participate in together, take a class or lessons of some kind together...<br>  <br>  ...start adding new positions in the bedroom, or adult toys, or new rooms/locations to do it...be more spontaneous (don't save sex for just before you go to sleep).<br>  <br>  Mix it up...add new stuff...make it fun (or the relationship is unlikely to last)

Q2UDhYgkaa	Just say - I'm sorry we are at different stages of our lives and it wouldnt work for me - its nothing personal.<br>  <br>  I think there are two things girls don't like to hear 'I'm not attracted to you' or 'you are crazy' - insulting a girls looks or sanity are not generally taken well but every other excuse should be taken fine.|`|gAC4QY7gaa	By telling her exactly what you said "I am not interested after trying so many times."|`|WFDXReXlaa	Aw cut her some slack. If she doesn't know what she wants to do with her life yet, she'll figure it out. But if you still think she is doing nothing with her life and want to get away from her, then say you just want to be her friend and be frank about what you think of her.|`|JQdkDQkWaa	Okay, there are a few ways you can say that.<br>  <br>  Way #1- Come out and just say it. (not recommended) <br>  <br>  way #2- Tell her nicely, make sure she isn't too hurt.<br>  <br>  Way #3- Completely ignore her (Also not recommended)|`|mFInMKSaaa	lead her to think you have less "marbles" than she does.  or tell her you just came out of the closet. either one will do<br>  <br>  Uh...Sarah, chill.  Get back to us in about a week, after you've....calmed.|`|eAx9wk1zaa	say u got a gf and she doesnt want u to talk to her lol hehe|`|AA10871086	delete her from your friends list and don't answer texts or calls|`|mFERFot1aa	personally i think you sound like the one who is a few marbles short..i mean at first you are really interested she is funny sweet etc etc then you do a big divert when she is interested and blame it on hetr saying she is a few marbles short..you only after the chase..I dont think your mature enough to have a relationship...its always thse who have the problems who project them on to others and your the odd one here projecting that image on to her becasue you are confused and cant face up to being an indecisive ****!
hXehbPVqaa	well at the start of smoking if u don't smoke much.. its so fun, u laugh so much at nothing, u cant stop ur tummy hurts... then u get really hungry and eats lots... cause everything taste amazing!!!<br>  <br>  then there's the real stoners that get high all the time.. like everyday and thats when they get real lazy and tired and dont do much but just sit there... u dont eat as much. your body just gets really stoned. you do just chill and do nothing its boring and it becomes a habit. <br>  <br>  <br>  sex is awesome when high<br>  <br>  your eyes go glassy red.. thats why people put in clear eyes.. it works wonders..<br>  <br>  <br>  weed just makes everything better... which is sad if u live your life on it all the time...<br>  <br>  doing it once in a while can be really fun<br>  <br>  joints are better then bongs for you<br>  <br>  bongs fill your lungs with water... because it is filted by water and you breath it in.<br>  you get more high on bongs because it is just one big hit|`|AA11447210	Depends on the person, and the drug. You can read up on various drugs and their effects. Not everyone reacts the same way to the same thing. Some get sleepy/low key, others get more active/anxious/paranoid. Most are somewhere in between.<br>  <br>  Why is this in Singles & Dating?|`|tU5NJVL3aa	You didn't specify -- high on what?  PCP?  Sherm?  Weed?  E?  Meth?  Acid?  Peyote?  Quaalude? etc...  They all cause for the most part somewhat different behaviors.  See the link for a LOT of information.|`|QBFbvO21aa	They get lazy, paranoid, their blood sugar spikes..so they need to eat, laugh at stuff cause it's that easy to entertain us, eyes get relaxed and smaller (china eyed) maybe even blood shot cause they get dry, heart rate rises, and some people even get too high and get sick. Most of us just sit and play video games.<br>  <br>  All in all, don't really excpect a pot head to leave their domain or couch unless they are driving to get more pot. :]|`|dfIphwUSaa	no they are really angry and they take the look of hitler's eyes....they become so much tempered that they dont understand and take anything normally that time....and they act very aggressive....|`|Q2UDhYgkaa	Do you watch South Park? One word - Towlie|`|a7M4V4Egaa	Oh, it's quite amusing. I've never been high, but my sister and her friends have been--on marijuana. Their eyes get bloodshot, and droopy, and they're very serious about wanting food, at least my sister and her friends are. Once they attacked me for a bag of Goldfish, and my sister ate a whole bowl of whipped cream.<br>  One of my sister's friends vomits when they're high.<br>  They do things that they wouldn't have done in normal circumstances, like my sister cheated on her boyfriend.<br>  And my sister and her friends often talk nonsense and tell me things they shouldn't.<br>  It's stupid, but very amusing.|`|AA10325474	being feels like flying...everything is easy and there are no important problems on earth...everythings a joke more or less..and u think u live forever...and even death is funny....and yep, eyes get droppy, and yes, your brain gets very very very slow....u think in slow motion..u feeel more than u think.....and yes, u relax, u relax totally...but the feeling isnt that "deep". real true happiness goes much deeper into your soul than this "high". after all its still a drug, and only the happiness u deserve yourself truely is the only one u enjoy completly...|`|wX9ybBqEaa	Yes.Everything will be funny and they're excited.Btw, you're asking for your school project.Other users might call you lazy.lols|`|J0tk2lACaa	It really depends on what kind of a drug they are taking.<br>  <br>  Weed<br>  This gives you a very chilled out affect. If you are just a casual smoker other side effects will be that you giggle alot, no explanation why it just happens also you will feel hungry and want to eat this is generally called "the munchies" and you mouth becomes very dry and your eyes become very red. The feeling you get in your body is like a warm wave os flowing through to different areas and it relaxes you to the point where you dont want to move.<br>  <br>  Speed/ecstacy<br>  Work in similar ways. In your head you have seratonin and dophamine levels basically happy levels which you control to make this easier pretend they are in cups and they are all half full you canmake yourself happier by say eating chocolate which releases endorphines to make the cups fuller and you happier (thats all natural) , when you take speed or pills they pour more and more water into the cups but not natural water..so you get happier and have more energy etc they trick your brain into thinking its REALLY HAPPY kind of like a fake adrenaline rush. Your body starts moving at 100miles an hour and you feel the need to always be moving and doing something. Sometimes you get like a floating sensation from the drugs that makes your body tingly or a bit numb. I always feel the need to chew something i'm not sure why. But this drug also has a terrible come down period, Which can be compared to like a sugar comedown lol but heaps worse!!<br>  <br>  Heroin<br>  This drug i've never tried so im not too sure but I know it has a similar effect to weed but its much more harmful for you. It relaxs you but it doesnt have the Laughing eating drys effect etc.<br>  <br>  Trips/lsd/acid<br>  I dont particularly like this drug but i know people who do. I tried it once, it makes all the colours around you brighter and all the lights look like spot lights, it makes everything funny and when i had one i was seeing stuff. I thought i was surrounded by helicopters and ambulances and cop cars but nothing was really there. It's quite dangerous but everyone has said to me if you take it in a room with a really good friend you'll be fine.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps
R1ecMOO8aa	He likes you.  But you are playing.
fvN18yvGaa	You haven't been hurt enuff yet, that will bring u around cause u seem 2 be cold as ice.|`|Fc0ZR1hnaa	It is normal. Some people make everything look just Rosy. Everybody experiences things differently and at different times. Don't feel bad or let the green eyed monster cloud you. It will just happen one day. They are not all losers either. There are some nice guys out there.|`|9FlUlbYXaa	Sure, it's normal.  Lots of guys have never been in a relationship until they're nearly 30.  Girls are raised to be in relationships, but guys aren't too interested at your age.  You can date older guys (30 and over) because they're usually more serious.  Bars and clubs are for one-night stands.  Get involved in something you're passionate about, like painting or art classes.  You'll meet lots of people of all ages who share your interest.  Best of all, you could make friends with someone who thinks you're perfect for some single man they know!  When you have something like that in common with a man, that's one thing that can get you past that superficial state you keep getting stuck in...The sky is the limit.
iOa7rriGaa	It means she has a man but doesn't care about him and wants you to ask her out. I'd stay away personally this girl sounds like trouble I mean what happens if you do ask her out but she stays with her boyfriend and then he finds out. This is only going to bring you problems you don't want.|`|QuEND8hxaa	Means she is keeping her options open.  Be an option or get out of the way.
EVDUAKPeaa	it sounds like the 2nd guy is wondering all those things could com from 2 different things...<br>  1 could be because of insecurity...this is not good because insecurity comes from not trusting u and that is the beginning of a relationship that is goin to turn out very bad...<br>  2 is a sign of over protection which is a sign thats saying "this is my girl...back off"<br>  i think that i the situation that ur in u should tell the 2nd guy to be nicer or stop asking me so many questions (if u havent already) and if he doesnt listen then dont bother trying to keep a realationship with him because he will just think that ur still falling for him and he will take control of ur life( if he trys to stop then i would try to give him more time)<br>  good luck<br>  hope u make the right choice!!!|`|kuBdwsbIaa	don't tell everything about you in beginning. oka first understand about them after that analyze him after that you can tell about yourself.|`|wX9ybBqEaa	First, settle up your fights with the second guy.You don't need him.He's an ***.Maybe he's too desperate to get a girlfriend.Hahaha just kidding about the *** thingy.<br>  <br>  The second guy is just adding your probs.You need to stop him.Break the glass between you two.Don't let the glass stay as it is.Do you get me?<br>  <br>  I mean, the second guy is like becoming a blocker for your relationship with the third guy.Or maybe a disturber.<br>  <br>  Secondly, get the third guy.He's nice.But don't get too obsessed with him.He might feeling weird with you.<br>  <br>  Right after you've settle up your probs with the second guy, get over the third guy.Don't get me wrong.I don't ask you to use the third guy.He sounds nice anyway :D<br>  <br>  Good Luck :D|`|ZwnfiWkaaa	You don't need to always be in a relationship. If another relationship forms, make sure you tell him of your current circumstances with your last BF.<br>  <br>  Ask yourself what do you want out of a relationship. Do you need it? Can you get it from family etc..<br>  Hope it goes well for you|`|lqINcThraa	It may not be you. It may just be the surrounding circumstances. All men at somepoint seem to communicate with one another. The problem is, once you have had one bad relationship, you will always pick out the bad traits in your future relationships. The whole jealousy thing is something that in the future you may have to try to let it go and just swallow your pride and apoligize. Dont let them abuse you verbally, but it just seems that maybe you are only seeing the bad things given your history. I wish you the best of luck!!!
bvkOjTsNaa	Try 411.com and type in her name, city and state.   She may have gotten married in the last 10 years, so if her last name has changed, this won't work.

Fqi7sgRMaa	Lols, it depends on how serious you want your relationship to be. If you want a causual one, probably any age is ok, just beware that it wont last very long. If you want one that will most likely last, get one in college. The reason that i say college is because that is the place that you will meet a person with your common interests and things will be very easy to share. If you want a middle school or high school relationship, that is good too. The older you are in school, the longer your relationship will last (generally). I am exempt from this because i have a relationship in highschool that is 5x the normal length, but my relationship is alot different then everybody elses.|`|c47KZP77aa	relationships are overrated and is a private and personal matter anyway, just do what you want to do.|`|W5h7UfZmaa	COME ON SHORTY FORGET THE TEN POINTS I will take two <br>  you can have a girlfriend any time you think your ready find the right girl who likes you and wants to go out with you it is up to the girl not the guy|`|1vJI7VQ0aa	it is a silly question all boys have had there first by the time there three.just not got iq to remember it until most one reminds them of it that is all-answer any age.|`|DTxQ2Tpvaa	never! simply ask your parents to help you get an arranged marriage. that saves the hassle  of dating and wasting money on flowers and chocolate.|`|eAx9wk1zaa	sooner the better, never be to young to get some|`|0Wf835Otaa	in primary school its more of just a going out thing- like if you have a crush and like each other heaps of primary school students go out in like year 5 to seven. I highschool things get more serious but not by much so i would say its ok to go out with someone from about<br>  year five though I know friends that went out in year 4 hahah:) my first was in year 6|`|cfe693074760514255e63a1a5d0dba6eaa	A guy should have a girlfriend when they feel comfortable having one. Not before. Don't feel pressured just because you see other getting into relationships. The truth is that they are probably not ready either and are just caving into pop culture.|`|cC5foIYoaa	any age i think but...but having a gf at the age of 12 isn't the same as the age of 16 at 16+ you have more of a relationship like eg.kissing hugging.<br>  hope it helps :)|`|YtRB9Mhtaa	When he wants to act in a way that would be inappropriate to act with someone who was just a friend.|`|asja3rk7aa	whenever u find a girl that makes u feel good, or u can at least put up with<br>  <br>  dont thing its weird to not have a gf, just wait and ull find a good one|`|JQdkDQkWaa	I come from a loose family so I had a boyfriend in 2nd grade...but i think the right age would be like fifth grade...|`|pk81muSDaa	I would say at around 14, maybe 13?<br>  :)
IbhX8kHxaa	If you wear a hoop and sit down, the hoop will stick up and reveal something you might not want to  be revealed!|`|VlzlPAEwaa	I didn't get one, and wish I did, put your dress on and walk around, I was stepping on mine, the hoop will help it stay aways from your feet. The only way you can tell if you need one, and how big, is to try walking in your gown,with your shoes on
FMWrcL4Waa	About the part about being scared/nervous/quiet around the person you like...happens to everyone, guys or girls. But I wouldn't worry about it.  Its ok to plan out what you want to talk about.  It could be anytime something funny happens, just remember to find a way to bring it up in class with him.  Or ask him questions about his life, he'll probably ask "what about you?" after each one. if proms really soon, you could try bringing it up casually, see if hes going with anyone, maybe hint that your not going with anyone yet.  You could also always ask him to prom... my junior year of hs, the girl i went with asked me.|`|99d22dd7b7cd8026652a056d4868918daa	Ask him to the prom..a girl asked me and I LOVED IT!
IPS3hWweaa	Yes, what exactly is going on?<br>  <br>  I'd feel really weird. But glad that its only a few days.|`|TpMoDiinaa	Depends on the situation. If it's high school or younger, probably illegal. College level, definitely suspicious, unless they had a close mentor/student friendship or something similar.|`|FRwl0GI0aa	yes of course
DZt0cs2raa	She probably finds you unattractive.  But seriously your 14......calm the **** down, keep your dick in your pants and wait till college.  The last thing you want is to get pulled back a grade.|`|dqZrq7Zeaa	Clearly she isn't feeling the same way. Let it go.|`|Ddd8LDPGaa	uhmmmmmm.....maybe ( idk a thought?...) she does not like you back....get over her find someone else, ur just 14 years old|`|DoYQeqGhaa	Because, it may have shocked her, and she doesn't know how to react to such a statement. Also, don't ask out any body, tell them that u like them, or DEFINITELY dont break you with them over msn!|`|oHENw1AXaa	because she doesnt like you. thats what girls do when they dont like you back.|`|vRc7ktcsaa	dude you are still a kid.|`|k9gvch4Eaa	yeah, its most likely because she doesn't like you ;(|`|DV8AIpjFaa	She either doesn't like you.<br>  Or she wants you to chase her ***.<br>   Its probably the second one because everyone likes to be liked. And its a psychological thing where we tend to like people who like us...even if we didnt to begin with.<br>  <br>  She probably wants some attention off you. Give her some, but don't chase her a** around like a puppy. <br>  <br>  I bet you any money that if you don't speak to her for a few days, she will be the one who speaks to you first. She will seek for your attention.

AA10325474	I personally do think there is no difference at all. maybe there is lil and big love, but...everybody says there is a difference between love and lust, but i think thats wrong..if u want somebody for sex u want to have fun with him, u want to make him/her feel good, u want to enjoy each others company...u wanna show him/her the best u can give..and i call that love....sex isnt as good and so huge because it means nothing...sex is love..and everything else is a lie|`|AA11447210	Lust is the sexual desire. It can happen immediately. Love takes time to build and grow as you get to know someone...it's not just about sex, but about everything else you find appealing about them.|`|ce50d4262e9335129109e8d1bc22d29daa	one is simply a psychical attraction- the other is a mental & psychical attraction... give it about 6 months and you'll know.|`|iOa7rriGaa	Well lust is when it's only sexual for both of you and you both want nothing more from each other besides sex.  Love is when you want someone for more than just their body and more than just sex. The only similarity I can think of is that they both do involve sex I mean if you love someone and end up being with them it will lead to sex and lust is nothing but sex. Otherwise there two different things completely love is a lot deeper than lust.|`|yPX1E3Bbaa	love is where you have a strong feelings of affections for another person and be romantically and sexually attracted to them.<br>  lust is a where someone has a strong desire either sexual or to possess something.|`|doha66YWaa	Love is when you like them for who they are<br>  Lust is when you like them physically more than anything else.|`|WI6uJhPUaa	surfcandee doesn't have a sausage.|`|7ofd2YS7aa	In my opinion, the definition of lust is [sexual pr sensual] wanting.  Love is when two people have a heartfelt connection between one another and trusts one another.  Many people have a problem with thinking that lust is love, but lust is plain desire mixed with passion--love is on a totally different level.|`|MXGFGBtZaa	Lust is based on instincts to be physical with a person. Love is more emotionally-based. If you look at someone and see a great attraction to them and a strong need to do show them appreciation physically, you are "in lust". It can be mistaken for lust because the feelings are so strong and in the same way as love, it would hurt if the person rejected you. Love can include lust.|`|tBdceRrPaa	Lust lasts for a few days to a couple weeks and may float between different people. Love lasts forever and is usually pinpointed on one particular individual.

IPoaeWXPaa	If she hits you damn right hit her back. No need for a girl to be hitting a guy. If she wants to hit like a man she should expect to get hit back like a man. <br>  <br>  Tell her ul stop hitting her if she stops hitting you. It annoys me how girls think it's ok to hit guys but ooooh it is so out of order for a guy to hit a girl...yeah right.|`|RVUYBxhnaa	My friend who is a guy has exactly the same problem. All the girls he hangs round with in his year hit him and tease him and call him names and everything, yet he's the one who lets us use his house to chill at after school and stuff.<br>  So when he gets annoyed and tries to kick everyone out, or, like you said, insults the girls or hits them back, everyone has a go at him.<br>  I find it extremely unfair to be honest.<br>  If i ever hit a lad id expect them to hit me back to, just like a girl would.<br>  <br>  I say find yourself some new friends. There obviously taking advantage of you and trying to get you into trouble.<br>  But i totally agree with what your saying, it's really unfair that girls are seemingly aloud to hit lads and they cant do it back.<br>  I say go for it mate, they deserve it treating you like that!<br>  xx|`|zpAAVvaOaa	You do hit us and we don't hit you all the time, not as hard as you hit us. And your insults are horrible sometimes, I mean you wonder why we have no self confidence, go hit some boys for once. Or just one time admit your wrong instead of going "No I'm right *Slap*"<br>  They aren't even real hits, they're god dam ***** slaps which hurt more than a hit. And I'm not saying you don't have feelings but instead of slapping back then walk away then no one gets hurt.<br>  But for goodness sake can you just cut down on the insults and slapping?! Please.|`|1QSsOAAFaa	not really. defend yourself if you fear serious injury, but otherwise, don't escalate the situation.|`|qcv4ICEHaa	if those bytches are taking advantage of you, beat them up as if they are boyz.<br>  <br>  Remember what feminist always like to say, " Man and woman are created equal."  Well, if that is true, no one should hit each other in the first place, regardless of your gender.  Similarly, you can fight those girls for your self defense as if they are guys. They are all equal after all.<br>  <br>  Don't let those so-called High school motto " you shouldnt hit girls" question your actions.  As long as you DID NOT intend to hit them first, its aiite.|`|bRQEqsm4aa	You should NEVER go around hitting a girl. Self defense is one thing, but hitting them is another. I'm not saying you hit her, but if she was doing it playfully, you should NEVER hit her back.|`|oiOw0eEPaa	If they are women they will complain about everything<br>  because women are weaker than men<br>  they should be protected because they are crazy!|`|AehXEySSaa	No!

sr7jX2wYaa	First  off you  are you, not your  mom. & you should  be  allowed  to be  who you are. It  seems your  mom is mistaken  about  what is  really of  value about  a  person. It  isn't  how  perfect  their clothes, & make up are, Or  how much  money  they have , or  even how  beautiful  they appear  on  the outside. It is  who you are  as a person on  the  inside   that really counts, & how you treat your  fellow man.  I am  sure  your  brothers do not  want  a different  sister. I will bet  they envy  your  ability to be yourself.  Why  not  ask your  mom  if  she has  ever heard of  unconditional love?  then ask her  does  she  love you unconditionally. if  she  says yes ,  if only you would. ... Then say Oh mother how sad this makes  me for you, to not  know  how  to love  without putting  conditions  on it.  even  with  this  fault of yours  mom, I love you unconditionally, & I don't  try  to change  you to be like me , to enjoy life without  the pretense of glamor. I accept  that  that is  who you are , how  you are , & what you enjoy doing. I do wish you could  feel the same about me. & be proud that I don't live my life  pretending  to be what you  want me to be, but for being  who I am,  being  how I am , enjoy doing  what I do.  Maybe  she will give  thought  to this  & respect you & allow you  to be you , once she  see's it  from your point of  view*|`|r8rykCkGaa	I think you want her to love you unconditionally and I had the same problem.  My mom wanted to copy her all the time and be exactly like her but I wanted to be what God created me to be, not what she had in mind in her own imagination.  So, this is a typical problem.  Just get close to God and find out what he wants you to do.  That way you can find fulfillment in life and blessings, and strength and acceptance (some of the time).  God bless you!!!|`|punA6kTraa	go to a saloon and yeah... just do whatever u want|`|BYQ2kHPjaa	Although I wasn't in the exact same situation, I can understand because a while ago I did have some problems with my relationship with my mum. I can honestly say that the best thing for you to do is to be honest with your mum and just calmly talk things through about how you feel. I always used to distance myself from my mum, so I just suddenly took an interest in spending time with her, even if it was just going on the weekly sainsburys shop. If there is an occasion, just make a little effort. Although everyone should feel comfortable in what they wear, I'm sure it wouldn't hurt for you to wear something that your mum would like aswell. Also just try talking to her about how your day has been etc., you'll be surprised at how that can help. <br>  I really think you should get more confidence, and remember that everyone is individual and unique. Good luck xx|`|Rp2Gkzg1aa	You should talk to her. That doesn't sound right what she is doing to you. Tell her that she needs to except you for who you are! Even if she continues to compare you to the other girls, remind yourself that you are a beautiful person on the inside(even though I don't know you). It doesn't matter what you look like on the outside... If you have a mirror or something, write all your flaws down. When your done, clean the mirror and wipe all that bad stuff away. Then write all the positive things about you. I hope I helped. If it sounds cheesy, sorry...

These house elves are permitted to live and work in our countries, are protected by our laws, and enjoy a MUCH higher standard of living in our countries than they did in Elflandia.  We've offered them jobs in our homes, and treated them with the utmost respect and kindness, and in return, they just keep asking for more and more.  Time to draw the line.  Tell him his wages and benefits are non-negotiable, and if he doesn't like it, you'll replace him with a domesticated gnome.|`|IPS3hWweaa	How can you refuse?

szVvf7Nkaa	Friends should always come first. Your friendship with your friend is more important than going out with this guy. I know you really like him but there will be other guys that you will like also. You need to tell this guy that you cannot hurt your friend this way. If you do this to your friend then your other friends will see that friendship means so little to you and they will not be able to trust you. Friends stick together and they never let anything or anyone come between them.|`|MXGFGBtZaa	Go with him. If he doesn't like your friend, then he doesn't like your friend. She can't do anything about it. But he's obviously into you, so it would be such a shame to let that go to waste. Just hope your friend doesn't give you a hard time. It's not like he's her ex or anything. I agree, it can be kind of hard being into someone for a long time and then someone close to you deciding they're into the same guy too, but just be sensitive with her. Don't declare that you really like him in front of her. Just be casual, say "it's kind of a date. but we're really just friends" or something.|`|FSNvkCL8aa	well if she is your friend friend.. i would sit down and talk to her straight up, and tell her everything and ask her how dose she fell about you and him. Then after that if u see that she is unsecured just be a good friends and back off so u wont hurt her felling Every Time she sees you whit him.
8K3IucU3aa	you're most likely jealous because he can get married a lot sooner than you can.|`|YwdsP4c2aa	It is perfectly natural, if not very healthy, to imagine what life would have been like had you still been with an ex. When you find out that they have moved on or seem to have achieved something you haven't, it brings the 'what ifs' to the fore.|`|0bs8X7Nvaa	you're jealous because he found happiness just like you but he is getting married before you|`|bf98cb4727a7dc06d952b1e5d2eb9e3faa	probably cuz he's doing it before u|`|AA11787105	If you have previously been sexually active with your ex, then there is going to be an automatic connection that will create jealousy.  It is natural human nature among mates to have jealous feelings towards those with which we have been intimate with.  As long as you don't actually ponder these feelings for amazingly long periods of time, then you will be okay.  Trust me, your husband-to-be would probably feel the same about his previous gf's.  It is a natural occurrence.|`|mThSnpi0aa	jealousy is quite common from what i heard from your previous relationship with another.<br>  <br>  From a psychology pov(point of view) jealousy may be formed because you may still have some sort of affection towards that person meaning you should try clearing all that up before marrying the guy you're with before you ruin your life|`|AA11288974	You are holding on to a dream you had with him or perhaps its a pride thing of you wanting to move on first. Stop comparing. Turn the jealousy into happiness for him that he is moving on. Then forget about him.|`|3qLIRorjaa	You obviously have unresolved issues with your ex, whether you want to admit it or not, some feelings are still there else you'd be happy for him - THATS when you know you're over an ex.|`|za9b8cHKaa	You're jealous because he has moved on and found happiness. Meanwhile, you are still waiting to find that special someone. Everyone has their own life to lead. He has his. You have yours. Your life will all come together one day - regardless of whether you choose to get married or not. Enjoy it.

You are not doing the grown up think and talking about any issues you have with this other girl here.<br>  You don't just dump friends over petty issues. A sign of strength of character is to try and see where your relationship with your friend went wrong and try to resolve it and then have a group of four. That is what a decent person would do. But maybe that other girl is better off without you if you can just dump her at the drop of a hat.<br>  Do you not realise that you are bullying her?<br>  How would you feel if they did this to you?<br>  It is selfish and immature.

Keep a man content sexually and he'll "love"you forever, give up in that department and watch him run.<br>  <br>  Before anyone says it, no I'm not bitter and twisted just realistic.!<br>  <br>  You feel deep abiding "love" for your kids and family - blood link and even then it can go sour|`|OeQbs95Naa	Its when that empty space where your heart belongs is taken away by only one person, its unconditional, its undescribable, its hurt, its pain, its happieness and joy all in one. Its when you care more for that person then you would for yourself. You will know when you do fall inlove one day.|`|AA11022311	Personally, I don't believe there is such a thing called "true love" Love will come spontaneously at the right time and place for two individuals. It could be triggered by sexual desire and longing for companionship. Love almost all the times slips away just like all things in this world that will never be immaculate and permanent. If both party shared common interest, belief including dislikes then you can call that mutual attraction commonly called LOVE. Endless love belongs to love stories you see on books, magazines and comics and movies, it will be being too much of a hypocrite not to admit "true love" is just a product of your imagination if you are very attracted to somebody.|`|gjiwSiH3aa	Living with someone for 23 years.

Its a bliss wherever you go ... it asks nothing in return and carries lots of care and understanding.|`|aYVVwjBXaa	true love is loving unconditionally, no matter what.|`|Fqi7sgRMaa	LOL True love can be met at any age. There is no thing that discriminates true love by age. This is a myth. The reason that this has been portrayed to be seen as teens not being able to find true love is because they generally introduce sex into their relationship and it messes everything up. You have 3 things that need to be met in a relationship and by introduction sex, it destroys those three and replaces it with one. Anyways. True love is when you cannot go a day without thinking about that particular person, you want them more than just for lust, you stand by there side at any cost, you stand up for them, you treat them with all the respect in the world, you care for them, you show them you love them, and so much more. When you find your true love, you will know. This is an experience that can truly never be described to you, because you have to experience it for yourself to fully comprehend it.|`|djUMvICoaa	True love runs deep and clear.  True love doesn't have to be with the person to feel it and is secure when they are gone knowing that they are still the only one the other one wants.  When you are younger it is so much about attraction and feeling needy like the other person makes you whole.  True love you compliment each other and make the whole bigger because you are together.|`|wX9ybBqEaa	THIS IS A PROFFESIONAL ANSWER.<br>  <br>  TRUE LOVE MEANS YOU'RE FEELING VERY VERY VERY VERY COMFORTABLE WITH YOUR LOVE INTEREST AND YOU JUST HAVE A FEELING THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO LET HIM/HER GO AWAY FROM YOU.<br>  <br>  YOU ALSO THINKING THAT YOU DON'T LOVE HIM/HER JUST FOR YOUR LUST.BUT BECAUSE YOU'RE FEELING COMFORTABLE WITH HIM/HER.WITH THAT, WHATEVER YOU DO WITH HIM/HER, HIM/HER WILL ALWAYS UNDERSTANDING YOU.GOT IT?<br>  <br>  IS THAT ENOUGH?

You love the person so much that you only want good things for the person. You wish that the person you love would never go away. They are there for you when you are sick and throwing up with a runny nose and haven't showered in days. But the part that is bad is when they say something or do something wrong, it feels way worse then a friend saying it. Love is great! As a teen I think you can experience love but not to the deep levels as adults.|`|yKQKzKwMaa	It always infuriated me as a younger teen when I was told I would have many other loves when I knew I was already in love with someone. However, true and unconditional love means only one thing: sacrifice. If you would be truly willing to sacrifice everything you hold dear to you, even yourself, for this other person, then you have true love. True love is not proud or boasting, and it keeps no record of wrong-doing. Rather, true love relinquishes the authority to punish those for any of that wrong-doing without condoning the behavior. "What you did was not acceptable, but I have chosen to stop feeling hurt over it."|`|K78UWQMYaa	"True love" is what a mother/ father has for their child! (although not all of them do)<br>  <br>  not the puppy love on which we base our marriages and relationships!<br>  <br>  "true love" doesn't necessarily mean:<br>  holding her hand or<br>  buying her things<br>  and all the other kiddy BS people think.<br>  <br>  you can only truly learn to appreciate what this feeling is when you have reached an age after which you have been thru just about everything in life and are still together and happy with each other.|`|lmc5ewx7aa	"Love" is a Western Idea according to Anthropology.

AA11696207	You are just right. You shouldn't do anything because everyone else is doing it. If you chose to do anything, do it because you want to and don't waste another minute wondering if that makes your normal. Quite frankly, what you are doing makes you emotionally healthy and aware of your boundaries. Good job. As long as you continue this way you won't end up in bad relationships. There is nothing wrong with physically showing love as long as you love the other person and know they love you.<br>  <br>  My firsts...<br>    Kiss - 15<br>    Sex - 16<br>  <br>  I wish I would have just waited...I only did what I did because everyone else was doing it.

Think about this...if you went out and had sex just becasue everyone else has then your going to have thoughts afterwards about was it the right thing, what if I get pregnant, what if I get an STD, and you'll more than likely regret your "first" not meaning anything to you. Wait to do whatever until your ready and comfortable...there's things more important in life to focus on than that.|`|ZZdQlOEsaa	u are not abnormal<br>  u are only 16<br>  still young<br>  u doesn't have to purposely go out<br>  and do it<br>  just because your friends have done it or got it<br>  u want it special<br>  u want to do all those with someone special<br>  keep to your stand<br>  just keep waiting<br>  that person will come<br>  all the best|`|IPS3hWweaa	You're not weird.

bvkOjTsNaa	You're right, she IS a grump!   I'm sure she's being like this because it wasn't her idea.   She also feels threatened because you are doing something positive and she's afraid you will become "more popular" than her.     <br>  <br>  I say go ahead with your fundraiser and ignore her attitude.   You gave her opportunity to participate and she opted out.  Once she sees that she's the only one not dressed in red, she'll be the odd man out.  Donate the money to charity and make it an annual thing in your office, continue to be pleasant and cordial to her and act like nothing happened!   Otherwise, you are giving her the power to affect your attitude and actions.|`|AA11184785	Ask her advice & help on organising everything.

Tell her that you just want to make sure she's comfortable, so you'd like to know what bothers her and how to make sure you don't do it.|`|MUQFpO8eaa	u have 2 be patient with her if u really luv her take her 4 who she is.i dont noe much about autistic gals but dont get on her nerves anyhow

Honestly, no matter who broke it off, if there hasn't been an awful lot of soul searching and personal growth on somebody's part, you probably shouldn't pursue a relationship that didn't have staying power before. I had a friend who dated the same guy off and on for five years. Every time they broke up for the same reason and she finally realized that even if they cared for each other, even loved each other, they were not couple material. So assuming you didn't break up over a dumb fight (which I assume isn't the case since you're still broken up), I think whether or not he likes you is irrelevant. Move on and find chemistry with someone new.|`|DV8AIpjFaa	mention an old memory. See what he says. Say 'remember the time we did this'  and pay attention to what details he remembers.

You are clearly looking for a simple answer, but there really is none. If you keep looking for solutions in every way you can, you will never find it. What you need to do is to relax, just calm down. Don't just calm yourself down for an hour or two, but for a few days. Try doing something totally different. Try just hanging out at a different place for a week after work or school. It might clear your head and you might just figure out exactly what you need to do.

I was starting to fall for him even if we haven't seen each other in person. We chat for hours, we know how each other look like but we haven't heard each others voices. <br>  <br>  I've felt so happy and inspired. At times no matter how tired and sleepy I am, I wait and chatted with him for hours, the time difference (he lives in another country) is not easy but all in all it's all good. That's one of the simple things I will do for love. And when we finally met, it's all worth it. He makes me happy and our relationship makes me happy.|`|iOa7rriGaa	I will never forget my first love and how I knew was I mean of course I had my crushes but when you are in love with someone you feel more strongly towards them. You always want to be around them and you always think about them and I mean always. I mean crushes can make you feel the same way but not as much not as strongly as you do when your in love. Plus once they leave you it hurts so much more than if it was just a crush. If just a crush you'll be over it within a couple weeks or so with love it never really goes away. You'd do anything for someone you love and fight till the very end for them.

8K3IucU3aa	that is putting money before love. you can't go into a marriage focusing more on money than your relationship. now i admit it is important but that's marrying and staying with someone only because they have money and where's the love in that. in a healthy, close relationship money isn't more important.|`|nUdbTUtHaa	I would say it is only acceptable if they feel like you're just doing it to be lazy.  If you're in the career that makes you happy, then this should be a non issue if you're in love.<br>  <br>  If you're doing it to be lazy then I would leave you too ^^|`|iOa7rriGaa	It sounds like this person telling their spouse this is most likely really insecure about themselves and are afraid that they are not good enough and that their spouse will leave them and if they believe this enough then it won't make a difference if they told them they wanted to be with them no matter what. I'd say it's someone who wants to make sure that they don't  get ripped off and it could be putting money before love but it could also be them playing it safe with their money in their mind.|`|lqINcThraa	I would say.. Put yourself in this other person's spot and think about how you would feel if you were told this being in that situation. There will always be one party in a relationship that makes more money regardless of the amount. I think that if it is true love, that doesnt matter. Advise of this concern you may have with someone who has been through it. Be careful and think it through..|`|4ByK2A7taa	in our world money alwayz comes first.but i think if u really love ur spouse tell them that u love them and money is nt imp as they are.its hard 2 find true love , so y dont u set an example by doing so.|`|k9gvch4Eaa	I would consider it as putting money before love, but do you really love him?

Give her my number!!|`|ocIsJXHGaa	her weight shouldn't matter, she's your girlfriend! why ask?|`|uQWKSQMzaa	That sounds OK.|`|szVvf7Nkaa	If your girlfriend is very beautiful then why would her weight be a problem for you. Don't you know that sex has nothing to with weight? I think it’s sad that you would question if she is good or not because of her weight. You want to have sex with someone because you care for that person. And sex is only good if you make it good. Maybe you should question yourself if you are good at it.|`|iOa7rriGaa	Wow how wrong can people get that shouldn't matter and so you know 160 isn't that bad it's actually pretty healthy and so what if she's short. And so you know it's not your weight that makes you good for sex it's how you work what you've got. You don't deserve her if you feel the need to ask such a question.|`|AA11650149	Wow, you are very shallow!  Why don't you ask her and see what she says??|`|1nMYqT1qaa	A girlfriend isn't just someone who you're with to hook up with, man......if thats all you're looking for then you shouldn't have asked her out in the first place.  In all honesty, if her weight is something that is preventing you from being intimate with her...let her go..because she definitely deserves to be with a guy that isn't judgemental..which you apparently are (by your words.)  By the way..160lbs isn't all that heavy.  Please, do try and grow up.  There is more to a relationship than a person's looks (looks are the first thing to go in life..as you age..remember that.)|`|c4ded2672a1b6461a7cf5ac2f327a09faa	If she is beautiful, then focus on that. Don't spend your time worrying her weight. If you focus on her weight you will run her off and instead of a beautiful 160 pound girl you will end up with 160 pound memory.

If you take your car back you'll seem like someone who doesn't feel the need to supply a person with transportation since you are no longer dating them. I sure as hell wouldn't let an ex boyfriend keep a vehicle of mine...he'd need to make his own arrangements. Relationship ends, benefits of the relationship also end (in my world).<br>  <br>  Ask where she's staying? You said she was at her best friend's house most of the time.

Get your property back, give her whatever may still remain of her property at your house, terminate contact with her and move on.  And no, you don't have to move in with mom to do that either.  Simply do not return any messages, emails, etc. and get an answering machine to screen your calls.|`|djUMvICoaa	Who has filed papers for divorce?

AA11914950	Well first of all about the love thing, or anything else, always try to be honest, so if you DO love her, I don't see how it could hurt to say "I love you too" back at the very least... and if you don't love her than DUH don't say it, and if u do love her and u don't say anything when she says it to you, then she might get the idea u might no like her that much... anyway about your question, lots of things u can do, but I say do something for her YOURSELF, so depending on your talents, and from what u said about her, I say u could write her a song, compose a peice of music for her if u can, u can still write a poem so don't leave that option out especially if u are good at it, u could try making her a video clip or something, or take her on a vication somewhere beautiful where ever she likes (or maybe make it a surprise if u already now where she might wish to go someday), u could draw or paint pictures for her, like maybe draw a beautiful landscape with sunset and birds in the sky and everything, or make some cartoon characters and jokes for her, like a comic strip, or make a sculpture of her or draw a portrait of her, or something like that... get my drift? something that's both beautiful and unique, something she won't get from elsewhere, sure she can e.g listen to music she likes or whatever but it's not gonna be about HER, but u can make one about her, and the coolest part is that u can even ask for her help, especially if u're not so good at any of these, but hey everybody has a first time so I say just go for it, it's gonna be pretty fun for both of you and she'll like it and it will keep you guys close together, I mean u can always take her to the movies or buy her jewelry or get her a dog, but shee could do those herself too so I just say GO FOR IT! and you don't have to make it really compicated for yourslef, you could even make her a handy craft like acard or a necklace out of pebbles or something, I dunno use your imagination, you know her not me...and gl|`|jX8qRYUDaa	write her a song (:<br>  <br>  xo|`|NH3IBuSiaa	The best thing you can do now is just be honest with her. Sit her down and tell her that you've loved her for a long time and that you're sorry that it took u this long to say it. <br>  <br>  Just look into her eyes and say "I love you so much" that's all she needs to hear!|`|lmc5ewx7aa	For my girlfriend I do something extremely special that she never would expect.<br>  <br>  Perhaps a promise ring!

It does not have to be expensive.    <br>  <br>  For you since your so shy just put the ring in a obvious place for her to find and smile. You don't have to say a word.|`|9wtYGGGCaa	Maybe take her for a walk on the beach and look into her eyes and tell her you love her and how much you love her, like I would do anything for you.. and that you haven't said it back because every time she says it, it makes you speechless.|`|qbZrYbFUaa	This kind of even outlines your situation; where you're too blown away to respond, even if you feel the same.

If there are any places with great views where you live, take her there and set up a small, special meal. It might be nicer to eat out sometimes, but if you prepare it yourself specially it will help her see that you really care. It is hard to say "I love you" sometimes but once you jump that hurdle it's so much easier.|`|BYQ2kHPjaa	First of all you need to get some confidence, so that you will feel able to say "I love you" to her. Just try to practice saying it in the mirror, then you will feel more confident about saying it. Honesty and trust are vital for a relationship, so just be honest with her about how you feel. <br>  She's obiously a romantic and I can definetly relate to that. Send her some flowers (roses are probably best as they are really romantic) and a card aswell that says something like "Ever since I met you, you are the only person worth thinking about. I love you." <br>  Try organising a really romantic weekend for just the two of you, like  take her out to a really nice restaurant and then a walk on the beach. Also, you can never go wrong with jewelery, for example my boyfriend got me a gorgeous heart charm bracelet for my birthday. Good luck xx
IPS3hWweaa	Yes, if a guy likes you he'll call. If you don't get a call, then he either wasn't interested or too afraid. Guys that are too afraid or too shy need to learn that they need to do something to show they are interested in a girl. I mean, c'mon, it isn't that hard to pick up the phone!|`|7b6177ffccd38a7fe7428a728f8a79c1aa	If he likes you, he *will* call.  But if he has the same assumptions (i.e. doesn't like chasing girls) that you do, then you run the risk of limiting your dating options.<br>  <br>  If you like him, just give him a call.  It's the mature thing to do, and it's pretty foolish to screen out guys purely on that basis.|`|zSXjd1Praa	Depends on what kind of personality the guy has. Obviously, if he's outgoing then he'll go ahead and call you, But if the guy is shy and a bit reserved, then there's no chance your gonna get a phone call, but that doesn't necessarily mean he doesn't like you!|`|Af6Ynh2Kaa	Well, it depends how close you are to this guy. Don't let him do all the work because he'll assume you're not interested. Just talk to him and smile, that'll send of some good signals out.

yxRGDjs2aa	Hi, that's an interesting question!  I think if it was all open and honest, I would neither find it a turn on or off that she was dating any of the other guys at a speed dating event.  Wouldn't it be far better if mutual friends all went out together if you all got on well at the event?  That way you could find out a bit more about each others characters before you committed yourself to a one on one date.  Bit like try before you buy, no risk dating, I like that!<br>  Whatever you decide, have fun!<br>  I hope this helps<br>  <br>  UK Personal Trainer|`|2EprWAmIaa	it depends.<br>  <br>  some guys like a challange. Some of us just get annoyed by it<br>  <br>  it depends what he is like, and what his attitude is, if he seems very protective or jelious  then dont date anyone else, if he is more care free, feel free to,|`|iTJ2YIH5aa	a major one.|`|gYDBdsWRaa	not a turn off. i wouldnt care <br>  itd be interesting. \|`|IPS3hWweaa	It would make me a little bit less interested, especially if during the speed dating I met a couple of other girls that sounded interested in dating.<br>  <br>  I would still talk to her, but I'd probably pursue the girl who seemed more available.|`|gAC4QY7gaa	Actually it would be a turn on for me <br>  because I like having my options also, I don't get having a exclusive relationship until you date someone who really strikes your interests.

I'm just as mature minded as everyone else.<br>  <br>  Anyway, what I love in a girl is when they LOVE to joke about, I love it when they physically muck about. Also, I love it when we can touch each other (not sexually) without it being arkward. e.g. me and my last girlfriend where so close. She would sort of sit on me when i was on the floor and i wouldn't get an errection! (proud of myself!)  Basically, just make it flow, nothing worse than arkwardness!!<br>  <br>  Also, if a boy goes for you because of your curves or looks, then hes a right wanker!!|`|raA9vMQlaa	What I really like is self confidence.

AA11621340	The first thing you need to do is decide how strong the threat is. Level 1 - she wants him, but he doesn't even notice.Level 2, she wants him & he notices but does not respond. Level 3, she wants him, he notices, & likes the attention. Level 4, she wants him, he notices & likes the attention & begins to respond in some way. Level 5 - Danger ! She wants, he wants, they act on it. <br>  <br>  I know it sounds silly to do this, but it helps you put things in perspective. If he's not interested, then you can talk to him about her & together develop a plan to get her to go away. IF you think he's responding on ANY level - even subconsciously beginning to like the attention, which might be natural for most men - then you need to act independently. But not towards her - you need to strengthen your relationship with him. If he has ALREADY responded or, worse, acted on this attention, you need to see a doctor, an attorney, and a counselor,<br>  <br>  So where is he on this scale? Where are you on the insecurity, jealousy, & paranoia scale? Just evaluate the situation & think carefully before you do anything. You don't want to drive him towards her - you want to keep him with you. Good luck!<br>  <br>  BTW - Killing WAS the first thing that came to my mind too - but it's not worth my spending time in jail. If she "won" in any way, there are so many other ways pay back - mostly by finding a happy life on your own, because you know she wouldn't stick around an older man for long once you took half his money away, now would she?|`|yPX1E3Bbaa	does you husband want that younger woman too? if he doesn't then there's nothing to worry about isn't it.|`|iWJ3BQQ9aa	just make sure your husband don't want anyone else but you.|`|28ddOgzdaa	Give ur husband lots of love, and make him urs,|`|TTGlYZP9aa	Confront her, let her know that you know...........then knock her out|`|JpG4zaA9aa	Many women at some time or another may want your husband.<br>  But, how is your husband responding to her??<br>  <br>  If you know for sure that she wants your husband, then you may need to have a little talk with this little girl and put some consequences in her head.  Don't be afraid to tell her that you will beat her *** but killing her is not worth it.<br>  If he does anything stupid, then get rid of him.|`|GgEDzW0eaa	If you trust your husband it shouldn't matter. Don't worry about what she want's, your husband will ultimately be the person who has to act on it.|`|YdUtuLhUaa	* above answer * best answerr !!|`|Vo9vwaXXaa	tell her to back the F*** off and if she dosen't KICK HER A**!!!  But killing is never the answer...LOL|`|PrKLoajAaa	well if he still ate at home I would let him go...|`|AA11447210	I wouldn't blame her...but as I wouldn't be married to someone I didn't trust, it wouldn't be an issue for me. People can "want" all day long...doesn't mean they are going to "get".<br>  <br>  Killing? Don't be ridiculous (and over dramatic). If anything occurred between them it would be his fault anyway, not hers. If he hasn't done anything why be upset? You need to ask yourself why she's such a threat to you...and why you don't trust your husband.
nel6xDSZaa	If she did it out of spite, I'd just drop her as a friend.|`|uRvwLkIBaa	First of all, a good friend wouldn't do something like that.  Ignore her and move on with your life.|`|GgAClEQUaa	hmm sounds like she was just winding you up for a laugh, but then again if you were going through a fallout then maybe she was trying to upset you to make the fallout easier?|`|IRtvIophaa	i would of called her out on what she said right there in class and asked her what her parents did because your dad has an important job.<br>  and if she keeps making smart comments just tell her you don't want to be friends with a little smart as* you thought she was different but now her true colors are showing|`|d3E1Dedoaa	You should probably ask her what she's trying to do or why she's acting like that, and if she replies angrily or rudely, just let her cool down and maybe ask her again but maybe in a way so she wouldn't get... too angry. If she retorts rudely again, you should probably not hang out with her anymore or just try to be nice to her, but don't put all your efforts into it if you know what I mean.|`|CN7ksRCEaa	slap the b iittt ch|`|WDEWAR8Faa	you can do it the boring but good way and ask her why she did that and try work it out between the 2 of you and try come to a conclusion<br>  <br>  or you can do it the more exciting but b!tchy way and just play dirty and get her back, shes showing her true colours so hit her back if shes trying to get to you, try get her back<br>  <br>  answer 1 might keep you guys friends but the second one would make you fall out completely your choice on what you wanna do now|`|MQO55d1Haa	i would confront her and say why did you say that?.. if you know it was out of spite then only you can decide what to do from there but if it was me id probably try and talk to her as she is my best friend and if that doesnt work out move on from her.|`|AehXEySSaa	If u think that she's your best friend then talk to her and see why she behaves like this. Does she consider u as her best friend? u know she did that out of spite...u think also that u r seeing her in her true colors...<br>  Just look deep into yourself and see if u still considers her as your best friend....good luck|`|KPSQcnwbaa	what she said is not true as paramedics are actually better than nurses as parmedics have to treat you outside of hospital and in some bad circumstances and there is only normaly 2 paramedics whilst in hospital they have nurses/doctors etc and they give morphine etc to people in pain whilst nurses have to get doctors to authorise them.what does her dad do? i think you shouldnt take it to heart as she was just showing off,keep your eyes open too see if she does any other sneaky sly things or comments and if she does then bin her as she aint a proper friend but she might not realise how its done your head in, so try telling her and clear the air
Pwg8IUbTaa	WRONG !  You have a good chance of being pregnant !|`|JdpYMDQpaa	No. Your not Pregnant. Your Boyfriend is. <br>  <br>  :P Jokes! You are the one thats pregnant. lol.|`|bYaxOfWOaa	Umm..... sorry luv, best go to the chemist for the morning after pill, a preg test and a box of condoms.|`|yPX1E3Bbaa	you never know. even if the guy where a condom there's might a change you'll get pregnant, so what do you think?|`|XCag7QRTaa	wtf what a question,if you knew about sex you can get pregnant from precum not all the time but its a chance,so even if a bit going in will prob get u pregnant ,nd ur a fuckwit for letting him grow up slagggggggggg|`|N2AKuvVkaa	You want to hear no don't you. Yes you can fall pregnant. Have you never heard of contraception? He probably said he was alergic to the latex, didn't he :)|`|AA11447210	You have a lot of chance of getting pregnant because of the foolish and unprotected behavior. You have up to 72 hours after unprotected sex to go to your local pharmacy and get Plan B over the counter (if you are at least 18) to help prevent pregnancy.<br>  <br>  If it's already beyond the 72 hrs then you'll just have to wait. If you can't have sex responsibly, you don't have any business having it at all. Keep your legs closed dear until you get some sense and learn how women can become pregnant. I don't want my tax dollars going toward paying for your unwanted pregnancy.|`|za9b8cHKaa	Wrong. You can still get pregnant. It only takes one single tiny sperm to fuse with an egg for pregnancy to occur. Semen contains thousands of sperm. If he penetrated you at all, without a condom, then yes you can get pregnant.
CaqdDzQZaa	he is just young and nervous he never had a girl friend and he does not know how to act and since you ask him out now he does not want to hurt you so he being extra nice to you give him time still be friends with him he still needs time to grow up|`|7b6177ffccd38a7fe7428a728f8a79c1aa	He probably values your close friendship, and while he definitely likes you, he just doesn't want things between you to ever change.<br>  <br>  If he doesn't want to formally cast you in the girlfriend role, then don't worry about it.  Just be his really close friend, and he will give you that label when he's ready to (if ever).  In the meantime, you can enjoy all the benefits of being a girlfriend, without formally being his.|`|798SjCdlaa	start with suggesting to him about going to dinner, movies and or the mall just as friends first and see where that gets you|`|PFVqo1wkaa	u just be happy that he didnt end the relationship. cuz most of the time guys end their relation when girls ask them out or stuff like that. ur situation could have been worse. so be happy, u guys are still friends. the guy is smart, he didnt want to jeopardize the friendship. he's being nice n talking to u more just to prove u he didnt reject cuz he didnt reject U. the problem is with him not u. just give him a lil more time, he'll get it.|`|ajSQYvINaa	maybe he realized what you said to him and he's the one who's gonna ask you out|`|SWBsLshtaa	I think he likes you, but he doesn't want to screw up the friendship|`|b536895bf6c779e662d180730661813faa	Seen a very similar situation before.<br>  Guy interpretation is very hard, they do not say what they really mean and so it's so confusing! And they call us confusing right?<br>  <br>  I think he really values your friendship since you said his one of your closest friends - which probably means a lot more to him then risking this friendship for a relationship that he doesn't think will work out. Which comes to my next conclusion, he isn't rejecting you as an option but he's testing to see if your girlfriend material or not. If he started talking to you a lot more then that's a sign! A good sign! I think you should just let it play and see what happens. Let him make the next few moves. Maybe you guys should hang out more 1-1 and go on well I don't know if you'd call them "dates" but spend time together - alone.<br>  <br>  I think he just doesn't want to be exclusive at the moment <br>  Which explains why it's not a rejection, he just doesn't want to be a committed man.... for now. Oh - he'll come around ;)|`|OtkLums0aa	I think that like he said, he just doesn't feel ready to have a girlfriend yet. He clearly likes you, which explains the extra niceness. <br>  <br>  But he isn't sure he can handle the full responsibility of a relationship and so he wants to take it slow and just be friends for now.<br>  <br>  Another possibility, though less likely depending on your age, is that he's not allowed to have a girlfriend yet but he's too embarrassed to say so.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|LBT1Mh3Maa	Umm, i would say he likes you but he might be a little scared to open up to you cause he still new to relationships. weren't you nervous when you had our first boyfriend? like kissing and hugging, all the stuff you see older kids doing. im sure hes likes you, im guessing he flirt with you over the phone with text. i do that sometimes.. lmao xD so just keep at him i think he just abit scared to get into a relationship .. you two can be like really close good freinds but still like each other :P hope i helped?|`|W5uXirA5aa	I think he likes you but he is shy and he doesnt want to get rejected you should place a move on him like a kiss go in slow and if he looks like he is opening his mouth go for the gold or to be safe go in fast for a quick peck and see his reaction|`|ojmlL9hXaa	Either he's not attracted to you, only wants to be your friend because he doesn't think it would work out, or he's gay
GW3WJeTLaa	i think u should keep in touch with them but u have to move on and met different people and lifestyles <br>  <br>  maybe u should join some clubs in school or out and make some new friends that share the same intrests and maybe try making some friends that live near u <br>  <br>  <br>  i hope i helped :p|`|GC6H1hrlaa	Well if you really loved your other friends nothing can replace them.. so i believe that you should keep in contact with your old friends and also stay in contact with your new friends :D:D your just confused because lots have happened in the past :D:D|`|WjyN8VL7aa	i know how you fell because ive been in the same situation as you.....i had to move away from my best friends in india....but now i think that you should still in contact with them.....don't worry, you will adjust with this situation.....you'll soon find a new best friend...don't lose hope...|`|dyhnK4eNaa	zameen par pool tho sabe dekte hai <br>   par usay utta tha hai koi koi <br>  dosti tho sabe karte hai<br>  par usay nibatha hai koi koi <br>  <br>  flower says tuch me but <br>  smile me not <br>  bird says catch me but <br>  kill me not <br>  and a friend hot says <br>  heat me or hate me <br>  but for get me not

AA10408209	Yeah, that sounds pretty annoying and I would probably be pretty pissed off too. However, you also don't want to create more conflict especially since you work together since that could just make things worse. I mean I would ignore it although those feelings are going to linger. Perhaps say something to her in response to the comments that is tactful and perhaps just not nasty. I am sorry I am not better help with this one but this is kind of hard one to tackle. Good luck and Take Care :)|`|Likst1Mxaa	Just don't be her friend. You can't change people's habits like that.
RhUjwovKaa	It sounds like you really do like him.<br>  I've had a song that made me cry before but it wasn't about me likeing somone. It was slipped away by avril lavigne. I cried because she sung this song because her grandad died, and i realized that because i still have ALL my grandparents that it's going to happen to me one day  this will happen to me. Also now that i am 13 i am more aware of what will be happening so it wil be really hard for me.|`|l0oDymHYaa	Hi Dear<br>  <br>  It says you are madly in Love|`|3J7xX66waa	RAFTI AZ YADAM<br>  DADI BARBADAM<br>  is ain Iranian song which made me cray,, its about loving some one ,,,lol<br>  so tragedy|`|yxRGDjs2aa	Hi, you know very often emotional pain can be so much more painful than physical pain and be so much harder to deal with!<br>  But as you and this guy feel the same way then you can deal with this together can't you?<br>  You know life can be very hard to deal with when you are growing up and discovering thins for the first time.  I promise you, that if you work together on this one, by the Summer you will look back on this experience and realise how far you have come together!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  UK Personal Trainer|`|fX6ENI8Zaa	Yeah there are a few songs that make me tear up and cry, just the way the singer sings them or the lyrics are relevant to me, or even I'va had a significant experience with that song.|`|6810Zwo5aa	I know very good this song I used to listen to it when I have brake up with my bf . And I was wondering does he sleeps in general ? if yes then  how does he sleep after that we are not any more together ??? It is very dear song for me|`|MFMaX2b1aa	I'll be missing you - P Diddy.<br>  <br>  It reminds me of a really close loved one that passed away and I cry for about 10 million hours.|`|6U25bcWBaa	it did happen once. but now i just don't listen to it :P and it doesnt have the same effect anymore either.<br>  actually, i try to find songs which i can relate to, helps my mood (if the song is not sad ofcourse)|`|QnjiSn1Zaa	I cried to this song the first time I really listened to the lyrics. ='(<br>  I guess cause I am hurt myself. Trying to stay strong but I've been crying for over a month now..

I have work too but I'm striving to keep up to date with it so I can have more time with him when he's free.<br>  <br>  I normally wake up and I think of him and especially b4 bed I think of him. It's like a lonely but wonderful feeling where you long for him to be by your side and you know he loves you and thinks of you too.<br>  <br>  But he's gonna be goign for 1 year abroad next year 2010 Spetember to japan to study! But I'm sure it wont change much because I'll be keeping in touch of course!!! I was suppsoe to go to Japan too but my uni organises it this year but I'll skip it because I dont wanan be away for 2 years from him since hes going the year after when I come bk!

K70Hkq5haa	First appearances are the lasting impressions.<br>  Shower,dress nice,use deodorant,and don't overdo the cologne(she may have allergies)<br>  Don't talk about past relationships.<br>  Find out through her friends what she likes. sports,music,etc.<br>  Don't talk so much about yourself and if she's whining a lot, excuse yourself, it takes about the first 10-20 minutes of conversation to find out if you really want to pursue this girl as her flaws may conflict with your personality.<br>  Trying to make her like you will only be to her as "annoying"<br>  Don't hype yourself to what you're really not,in other words just be yourself, you want someone to like you as you are.<br>  Girls are curious by nature so if you reveal all to her in one meeting,they'll be nothing left to talk about if you do go out on a date with her.<br>  Check her mannerisms with her friends,family,and animals. Actions speak louder than words because the way she treats the above mentioned is the way she's going to treat you.<br>  Smile at her or if she's smiling at you, it may be a tell that she wants you to talk to her, don't! it'll make you look desperate. Let her come to you. Don't ever rush into something you'll regret later on down the road, if it's meant to be, it'll happen.<br>  Foremost, don't ever kiss and tell, it will get back to her and not only that it'll make you look stupid after she's done with you.<br>  Make her laugh, and if she doesn't laugh at your sense of humor then it'll be another tell that she's not interested.<br>  Take your time and think before you leap.|`|POZvhqj4aa	good personal hygiene look clean and fresh,know how to carry a good conversation but don't talk like a machine gun know what you are talking about say nice things or don't say anything.

At least 20 - 25 lbs would serve you well.<br>  <br>  Being too thin is just as unhealthy and unnattractive as being too fat...take care of you! Of course, you're guy is skinny also. He should be more around 171 - 201. He could do with another 20 lbs too. If he's muscular, then he's even more light for his height, as muscle tissue weighs more than fat. He should be a lot heavier than what he is.<br>  <br>  Both of you need to put the weight on in a healthy manner though, not through junk food.|`|AA11159298	87 pounds....... u must be really tinny.

GW3WJeTLaa	i think u have to talk to them whatever happens and not include jealousy u have to kno that sisters r irreplaceable and try being friendly to them and do nice things to them then they will release that u just mean well intentions and not just being better than them ull understand it when u live a part or u lose one of them (hopefully not)<br>  <br>  that's my opinion and u decide<br>  <br>  o hope i helped:p|`|uQWKSQMzaa	I have no idea.|`|AA11447210	You've asked this before (multiple postings are a violation here) and the answer is, your sisters might be jealous. If you want to know exactly how they feel, sit down and talk to them. We don't know them and cannot read their minds.|`|PK498w0Saa	There could be may reasons that they aren't nice to you. It could be jealousy as you suggested, it could just be (and no offense) that they don't like you. They may think that you're different from them and don't enjoy the same things that they do and so don't invite you because they think you're too different to have a good time with them. Maybe they have a long lasting grudge, could this mean something to you? Maybe you should try inviting them out somewhere and see if you enjoy it. If you don't have a good time then maybe it's not worth pursuing your friendship.|`|jtjISk6qaa	they are jealous. they didnt work hard enough to get a good job but you did. dont feel bad.|`|KkjOXRRWaa	No|`|PlRYgRcoaa	Stuff them, my bro's and sis's are crap to me, I just don't answer anymore, i don't need that crap.|`|IRtvIophaa	there probably jealous of you but only because now they probably feel like they have to compete with you and it's hard for them to do that when you got a better job and your all sucessful i'm sure they'll come around talk to them and see whats actually bothering them and tell them you guys are sisters you shouldn't have a separtion between the 3 of you. tell them how it makes you feel,<br>  good luck|`|Ipj0dbrQaa	ooh i know how that feels, it would definitely be jealousy. they were dating while you worked hard to get where you are now. i know it hurts but ive got to the point where i don't care what my sister thinks any more.|`|PdmIUD8faa	As a middle child i hate my siblings because they are such assholes and bitches who hate me for being a middle child, and for having more dreams and aspirations then them. but hey thats life|`|rnOJn2UCaa	I can see by the postings that you have asked this question before but i feel you are still looking for the answer that will settle this inner turmoil.. perhaps you have looked questions regarding relationships with siblings on line to confirm your beliefs, or tackle your inner truth. Heres how it is ....they may resent your successs. But not so long ago they envied, admired and stived towards it ;and you may have worked even harder to keep those feelings toward you. But now you feel left out and and are not sure how to fit their mould, deep down when thy admired you , you felt accepted and safe. Now though you feel abanoned and different. Answer ....be humble, be strong and forget what devides you. But do not apoloigize for your success. remember you are all part of the same seed and they too may just want to know you accept them too.

If not maybe hes moved on, or maybe he was just telling you those things but still wants to be single for awhile. yaou never know whats going on. but dont worry you will talk to him eventually, just be patient and good luck :)
2EprWAmIaa	love hurts like that. it happens, and i am sorry it happened to you<br>  <br>  the best answer is to stay away. if you are always close to them, you wont be able to get over them. but you do need to move on, you already know they are bad for you, which means your just going to get hurt, even thought it hurts getting over them, its nowhere near as bad as getting close first|`|7b6177ffccd38a7fe7428a728f8a79c1aa	I avoid them, and find someone to fall in love with who is much better for me.|`|2LNNY4Pgaa	what do you mean..<br>  sometimes you have to follow your heart and see where it takes you..<br>  sometimes the best thing for it is to get broken and be prepared for it because otherwise you may never get over it.. <br>  it souns cruel but its the only thing to do..<br>  i have tried to get over someone before and it took to long so i ended up giving up.. this person broke my heart and i was so upset but soon enough i got up on my feet and i knew i was worth more than that..<br>  a friend tried the same thing but when she gave up and started giong out with him he totally changed and now has a great relationship going..
kWjy7uzAaa	What the heck where you thinking little girl!? Do you think you where too smart and mature that you could date a grown man? And now he used you and took away something very special from you , you can never get it back. And you will lie to all your future boyfriends about this and start every relationship you have in the future on a lie. File a police report and date guys your own age u idiot.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	He's 23 and you're 14. This is statutory rape. What's wrong with your parents? <br>  <br>  Don't tell me you didn't know at 14 what sex was.<br>  <br>  Once you lose your virginity, you don't get it back. Not even little princesses like you, dearie.|`|AA11650149	Once it's gone, it's gone forever.  What are you even doing dating a 23 year old man?  You aren't even a woman yet!  There is a lot of responsibility that goes along with having sex.  You know you aren't ready for sex if you have to log onto Yahoo Answers! and asks questions about it.  Well, I guess all that's left to say is get over it and don't make the same mistake in the future.<br>  <br>  <br>  Your parents approve of you dating a 23 year old man?  Wow, that is sickening.|`|1uRUaSblaa	You cannot reverse what's done.<br>  Gotta deal with it.

That's kind of hard to believe.<br>  <br>  But I'll humor you:  No, you cannot get your virginity back.|`|gAC4QY7gaa	Call the COPS and tell them that your ex stole it from you, that'll get your virginity back.|`|i4bjQbPcaa	Aww you poor thing.  Unfortunately you cannot get it back.<br>  <br>  Your boyfriend is 23 and I think its disgusting that he would want to have sex with a young girl.  You are far too young to deal with the emotional fallout from having sex as proved by your question.<br>  <br>  Do you parents know that your boyfriend is 23?<br>  <br>  Edit:  Now I know it's bullshit, there is no way parents of a 14 year old would want their daughter going out with a 23 year old.  Grow up|`|aw5BGkmLaa	Yes, you lost your virginity forever. What he did is called statutory rape and you can prosecute him and have him put in jail if you want. It is up to you.|`|DESWKtdgaa	Get your back-side down to the police station with your parents before this idiot ruins someone elses life too! And I wouldn't count that as loosing your virginity I would call that ABUSE!|`|be347121706c74c11d0d40946220599eaa	You can't get it back.<br>  <br>  You could file a police report against him?<br>  <br>  As he is 23.|`|mJo35PwXaa	I PITY THE FOOL|`|speJXeIhaa	Lol sure - you dumb ***** - like we believe that...|`|12ALGqtdaa	Where do I begin? <br>  <br>  First of all, you can't get your virginity back sweets. <br>  <br>  Secondly, going with what someone says when you don't know what they mean is never a good thing to do. <br>  <br>  Also, it was illegal for him to have sex with you, he's legally an adult and you are NOT. <br>  <br>  I'm glad to hear that you've got rid of him. <br>  <br>  Next time please listen to your head and think about what you're doing before you proceed.<br>  <br>  Are your family extremist Mormon's or something? Your folks should be put in jail.<br>  <br>  Are you sure that you actually had sex?|`|rEFHlhmdaa	wow i'm so sorry about that but what is up with your parents you are 14 and they haven't told you what sex is? they have failed on such a profound level that it is sad. and they are the match makers? well i am about to be 18 and my parents still wouldn't be comfortable with me dating a 23 year old so they fail again by being match makers. I hope he at least used a condom...ummm did he? this guy kind of sound like a pervert. why is he interested in a 14 year old (no offense to you)|`|OEOAN2yiaa	Genuinely...at 14 years old, you didn't know what sex was?<br>  <br>  Seriously....that's really hard to believe.<br>  <br>  And duh! No, you can't get it back, sorry.<br>  <br>  Guess you should have found out what it was before doing it....whoops.<br>  <br>  And if you are serious, about the not knowing then, sorry for the sarcasm....but it IS hard to believe.|`|aIWPWTuQaa	Hey Sweets!<br>  I'm afraid there is no way of getting it back, but you certainly need help. Definitely tell your parents exactly what happened and then go to the police. This is statutory rape, and is illegal. If you have a school therapist I'd recommend you see them too. You are still so young, so do not allow this incident to inhibit your life angel!<br>  xxx|`|qR9RDSEEaa	it's a one time thing.. you've lost it.<br>  but he could get into ALOT of trouble.. <br>  he had sex with someone thats underage.<br>  btw how can you not know what sex is?<br>  we get educated about it, and surely you've spoke about it to someone.. friends? close family members?|`|Xy8RmhQ7aa	its gone,<br>  i cant believe you didnt know what sex was at 14<br>  i knew what it was at like 5.<br>  <br>  personally i think your bullshitting.<br>  anyway virginity in a bathroom is better than in a backyard|`|lmc5ewx7aa	That's illegal underage sex.

0ClA7HlEaa	Just talk to her.....you are to blame but she should care cuz she got <br>  <br>  dump. Go comfort her. you dont want her to feel bad. its kinda your <br>  <br>  fault cuz you like his bf when your FRIEND is dating HIM.|`|NXA4fJbTaa	its all your fault. <br>  she had just broken up with her boyfriend so if she was crying it wasn't 'totally pathetic' and it was on the same night so honestly youre kind of a  s h i t y  friend :)<br>  <br>  <br>  oh and btw<br>  the word totally is SO last year.|`|hktbfRPWaa	While it may not be your fault he dumped her for you surely the fact she got dumped is enough to make you think that she'd be upset! Never mind that he wanted her best friend. For you to then just tell her to get over it and get straight with this guy is hardly considering her feelings. You were being selfish. Just because you didn't say anything before and that it was his choice to dump her doesn't mean that makes it all ok.<br>  <br>  I think you need to say sorry to her and consider how she must feel|`|vDSRgHxDaa	Why don't you put yourself in her situation, say your BF dumped you for your best friend and your best friend just didnt care for you, she just went with your BF. Are you a bit s l o w? Obviously she is mad at you for being a horrible friend.|`|KHI7MB4iaa	Just because someone stops crying doesn't mean they're over a situation :/|`|wyAbkG3oaa	Some friend you are.|`|JJARLh3zaa	she maybe not have been nice to you when she walked in, but be honest with yourself. do you honestly think you don't deserve it if you're going out with her ex?i think you're at fault here|`|OjPup8jqaa	That's horrible.<br>  <br>  don't you have the rule that exes are off limits?|`|NlC3xaK8aa	OK so ROSALIE!!!! Was dating this guy and i totally liked him too, but i didn't say anything cause i'm a nice person. And when he dumped her for me (which i totally had nothing to do with) i was like "OMG just get over him" and she was all crying and stuff (totally pathetic) but when she finally stopped crying i figured she was over it.<br>  <br>  Anyway there was a party that night and she kinda walked in on us, and she started throwing stuff at us and i was a bit like "OMG!!!" and then a lampshade hit my head and i was like "OK YOU AND ME OUTSIDE!!!"<br>  <br>  Well now i have mustard on my sweater from where she chucked her chips at me, fat *****.<br>  <br>  What should i do to show her that i'm not to blame and she totally shouldn't have cared!<br>  <br>  Thanks babes, MWAH <br>  <br>  <br>  This is how pathetic you sound. Reverse the names and see how you would feel if that happened to you - if you caught your best friend making out with your ex - it hurts v- dunnit!!<br>  <br>  whats more important; a stupid boy that you probably won't marry or your best friend???|`|WDEWAR8Faa	okaii i see what you mean but did you ever even ask her if she still liked him???<br>  <br>  if she's your best friend you should of at least known her point of view because she must of thought you were man stealing. you should of assured her that you didn't have nothing to do with it at first. and its not "pathetic" that she was crying i mean put yourself in her shoes, what if you were going out with a guy and then he dumped you for rosalie im sure you would be upset too.<br>  <br>  just try and tell her that it had nothing to do with you and try regain her trust|`|b536895bf6c779e662d180730661813faa	It actually is your fault and sorry to be the honest b i tc h but you deserved that.<br>  Your friend Rosalie never knew you like him, so to hear this was not only backstabbing but completely cruel and it definitely put your friendship in a really award situation.<br>  <br>  Put yourself in her shoes. <br>  Your dating a guy you absolutely love.<br>  He dumps you. So you go to this party, still overwhelmed with the thought of your break up. And just then you see your best friend, someone who you thought you could trust and be there for you to get over this (doesn't take only a day) with your man!<br>  <br>  You were telling her to get over him so you could have your chance with him? Wtf is wrong with you selfish so called friend?<br>  <br>  You are 100% to blame<br>  If it was me, I would make sure you went to the hospital.<br>  <br>  YOU DID IT IN THE SAME NIGHT TOO? <br>  You call her pathetic too... for being sad that her boyfriend who she loved broke up with her? Clearly someone has never meant a lot to you if you think it's pathetic.<br>  <br>  YOU ARE NOT A TRUE FRIEND.

POZvhqj4aa	if she wants to be friends just keep talking to her she might change her mind later, you need to cut out all the flowers and fancy gifts that you try to impress her it's not worth it when she doesn't appreciate them. Try to focus on how to impress her with your personality first until you get to the next level.|`|PUAUR9Quaa	by the sound of it you are pestering her<br>  <br>  heres a question to ask yourself: do you keep talking to HER or does she keep talking to YOU?<br>  <br>  because tbh it sounds like she just feels sorry for you and not attracted to you at all, she may just be a very friendly person<br>  <br>  but of course you don't have to listen to anything i say but just speculate what i just said :)<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|WVNMnvXLaa	i think your just too ugly for her dude...sorry|`|3IXDx9nhaa	It's like 'she isn't that into you' kind of thing.  She probably enjoys the attention to a point but she has made it clear that she just wants to be friends. She sounds like she likes your company as a friend but isn't interested in you romantically.  If the chemistry was there on her side then something would already have happened.  Keep 'just friends' with her.|`|0RMBQphHaa	Sounds very awkward. Well i believe you should drop some hints and when you are totally ready to let it out the bag, you should do something really special and out of the blue then that way she may think you really love her and she may fall for you herself. Good luck :)|`|50ly9o5taa	If she knows you fancy her and it doesn't change her mind, you don't want to make yourself more available by telling her you love her! Just don't take any notice of her for some time. Play hard to get, she'll come around.|`|W5uXirA5aa	OK dj look man you got to let the girl know how you feel...maybe dont use the word love because that might scare her away but use the word really really like you...and show her you like her not just buy spending your money cuz thats cool and all but you will not develop that connection with the girl you got to be assertive like by giving her a hug kissing her forehead you know that type of stuff make the move if you wait to long then you will always just be seen as a friend.|`|1iPWFbxnaa	unless you are still willing to do all those sweet stuff to her, the only thing to go a step forward is really to tell her what you feel.|`|GG4tAymsaa	she probably just wants to take things slow, which you should respect. otherwise you'll just come off as obsessive... oh and btw... love is a strong word that can scare some girls away - so think twice before you use it!|`|KTKuPnaqaa	i feel like saying stop talking to her for sometime and see how she will react.. at least that what my boyfriend did to me and we been together for 18 month already.... but as a warming... it really hurts to be ignored...|`|Td4Wn8XMaa	How about telling her you Love Her !  you may just find she feels the same way  but is not sure how you feel. so go on take the bull by the horns.so to speak
VG2X9Ihkaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Have you asked them for their reasoning for not letting you do what you wish?  Is there issue(s) of trust or overly protective guardians?<br>  <br>  I know sometimes parents/guardians can be overly protective or are scared that their child(ren) could get involved with gangs or drugs.  I am not saying that you are one of them but it would be good idea to talk to them.<br>  <br>  My son is turning a teenager and my wife is overly protective of him where as I let him have his freedom as long we have understanding of trust.  He knows that if trust is broken then he will hard time to re-build it.<br>  <br>  I hope you find a way to get them to let you do your thing.  Good luck<br>  <br>  :o)|`|t2R3mEMoaa	There is not a person on this planet that always gets to do what they want. Even an adult has rules and regulations we must abide by and if not there can be severe consequences. You are 16, still very young and have your entire life ahead of you. A little more freedom wouldn't hurt however. Try talking to them in a mature way so they will know you are responsible, and going out the window isn't. It's a very rough world out there believe me. Are you ready for that kind of responsibility? You will have to work to support yourself, there is rent, heat, hydro and food that needs to be bought. Think about it before you make any quick decisions.|`|PeNTl6KOaa	you can move out when ur 16<br>  <br>  xx|`|AA11416725	well dude just wait until your 18,and then you can go out on your own and come and go as you please, but just let me tell you that things aren't as fun as easy as you think they are trust me on this, your guardians just want to keep you safe from all the harm that you just might run into, and trust me juts stay where your at for now,things just can't be that bad, ok .be safe stay in school and don't sneak out at night.and my god bless you and keep you safe!!!|`|ewDKMeJkaa	i dont think moving out is the answer, although it is legal if you really want to<br>  <br>  talk to your guardians and tell them although you appreciate that they care, you would like a bit more space and freedom<br>  <br>  its part of growing up|`|IOYisVssaa	i think they think u are stiil a kid explain to them of how u feel and break the clutches|`|cfbd196bf94293a23a65c9e7f3a9c5d7aa	Talk to your parents and let them know that your growing up; It's time for you to make your own decisions.Ask nicely and eventually your parents will understand that your growing up. It's only because they don't want you to get hurt, or loose you..<br>  <br>  Good Luck =D
BpyUcZ4Xaa	Aw, that's so cute. You're a youngta, don't worry about looking for love right now. Enjoy your life while you're young and enjoy exploring relationships too! You'll find her someday ^_^|`|OyBuEpOTaa	There are many that are the right one. It is not necessarily being made to feel like the most special girl. it's being cared for. A per son you can trust to be honest. each person is going to be attracted to different sorts. so it's not as though all girls like a certain kind of guy.you have your own personality. Some will find you attractive and some won't.|`|G6Uy43coaa	Instinctively, when I see him, I will know.  As i wrote that, I remembered one particular man that I felt that way about.  I saw him years ago across a street and wow....it was like a connection that I cannot explain and we had not even said hello.  I still get that feeling sometimes and it makes me look around..like he is near but I know he is not because I never see him.<br>  <br>  I spent many years trying to find someone to love and who would love me back.  I found a lot of the wrong men in the process and I can truly say I am thankful for that because I know what i will no longer settle for.  I don't NEED to be with a man just to say I have one.  I WANT to be with the man I love and who will love me back.  No more settling because of loneliness or boredom.  I'm in it for the love.  There's nothing better than love....<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7r7ylML-bI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7r7ylML-...</a>
NVJpHmQdaa	Definitely awkwardness. If people poke fun at you (not saying they do or that it is serious) he will be embarrassed to say anything. I had a girl tell me she likes me and I kinda froze up because my friends were sitting there. He's interested. Just let him work it out and become used to the idea.|`|rCvA7dDyaa	Well you can always ask him out.
zSXjd1Praa	Keep friends with her!<br>  If she has come back to you after your argument, then that's worth holding on to.<br>  There's no reason to let her go!

Af6Ynh2Kaa	Well, the first time i did it with my girlfriend was fine. I was a bit nervous, but as long as you and your partner are comfortable with each other. Everything will go fine. And after the first time it just gets better and better! Nothing will go wrong if you're with somone you like and that likes you.|`|7b6177ffccd38a7fe7428a728f8a79c1aa	Usually it's awkward, quick, and only worth laughing about in your later years.<br>  <br>  You can get pregnant, an STD, and you have the added headache of having family members potentially walk in on you in the act.<br>  <br>  It's better to save it for marriage, or a committed relationship.|`|AA11447210	First time for anyone is usually awkward, for females also uncomfortable or painful.<br>  <br>  What can go wrong? Pregnancy, STD transmission...pretty serious stuff. Don't have sex unless you've got money in the bank (or your own health insurance, not your parent's) to cover those things.<br>  <br>  If you can't pay, don't play.|`|zSXjd1Praa	Personally I haven't had it, but I do know a few things.<br>  <br>  Almost always for the first time, If both of you have never done it, its disappointing for the girl. Don't expect anything amazing first time around. The more you have sex, the better it gets!<br>  <br>  Not much can go wrong if you are wearing a condom, Unless somehow the guy loses his erection because of any type of stress.<br>  If you love each other, it wont be awkward. You need to get to know each other before hand and stuff, like really get emotionally involved with this person so you know what they like and dislike.|`|MFMaX2b1aa	I lost my virginity at 13 years of age.<br>  I had my first orgasm too. <br>  <br>  For me, it wasn't painful - it was kind of awkward at first, but we had 45 minutes to spare, so we got used to it.<br>  <br>  The guy I was with at the time was 2 years older then me and wasn't a virgin, we didn't use protection - but thank god I didn't get pregnant.<br>  <br>  It was actually fun because he was a player and knew all types of moves - like when my leg was on the table and he did his job.<br>  <br>  The second time - it was kind of really awkward since I was doing it with the guy I loved, my heart was beating like a race horse and I couldn't stop thinking if it was as enjoyable for him as it were for me. <br>  <br>  The third time, much better. Since it was with the second guy that I'd done it with, and we had known each other for 2 years. (We're still together).<br>  <br>  - Sex is good, yes, but don't get obsessed with it.<br>  I really wish that I'd have kept it for my first love, not just some guy I met at some park one night.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps - God bless x|`|bYaxOfWOaa	Painful! So much more painful than I expected, for about the first 3-4 times. And I was NOT expecting to bleed that much...... so yeah, it was quite embarrassing. But it was with a guy who I was in love with at them time, 6 years ago and though we broke up soon after, we're still good friends, which means a lot to me.<br>  <br>  ***It does get better though! Much, much better.|`|mrWMFz6Caa	First off im not condoning teen sex. Anyway, some things that could happen with the "first time" is:<br>  <br>  the guy could prematurely ejaculate.<br>  he could hurt the girl if it is her first time and his penis is to large.<br>  he could pierce the hymen in the vagina.<br>  <br>  it is a little awkward the first time unless you are comfortable with being around your significant other.|`|ABzyerQfaa	i was 15 when i had sex for the first time and i really enjoyed it. it was the first time for my boyfriend of that time as well and he didnt complain! it is true sex does get better after the first time, but first times dont need to be awkward as long as he knows where to put it haha xx|`|4fnu8XeWaa	my 1st time was the greatest of all!! :)<br>  even tho i was really young (16).. i loved the 1st time!<br>  if u both want it nothing can go wrong!<br>  hope the guy u'll choose to be ur 1st is good with u and try to be nice and do it slow so u wont hurt!
AA10222073	Just... try not to think too much about it.<br>  You don't want to make yourself really physically sick!|`|8DhmRwMraa	just bc he said he was a  9.3 doesnt mean he likes her ... i dont think.
iWJ3BQQ9aa	let it be if it will happen it will if not just keep on being his friend and look for a new person to be interested in you.
pkr8hdBCaa	That emotion is lust/love. you like this guy, and everytime you see him you feel that way. A lot of girls get like that around someone they really like. hmmm but i noticed you said he likes your bff?  Well if thats the case dont fret. if it doesnt work out with him, you can get someone else :)|`|2EprWAmIaa	well, it could just be a silly crush, or an infatuation(i sa, but if it has gone on for a while now, It could be love. it all depends on how well you know him, or how long this goes on for.<br>  <br>  if it is love, you will know.<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|Vo9vwaXXaa	COME ON!!! you seriously can't be that SLOW.... Your obviously crushing on this guy and you got jealous when you found out he has a thing for your best friend... The real question is What are you going to do about it???|`|5qqHNpmcaa	LUUUUUV! =D|`|BYQ2kHPjaa	You obviously have a huge crush on him, because I remember feeling exactly the same way whenever I saw my now current boyfriend and still do. If he's single then find out if he likes you back by flirting with him a little and take an interest in what he likes. Besides, you will never know until you try. But if he likes your friend, then forget about him and move on. Good luck xx|`|yPX1E3Bbaa	i think you're in love.
7b6177ffccd38a7fe7428a728f8a79c1aa	It does for me, if I see a really great (and unusual) combination of features.  Megan Fox (the actress) does it for me, since she has the exotic look, along with really gorgeous eyes.<br>  <br>  But my insides don't really get queasy or fall apart anymore, like they used to when I was younger (at least, not over a woman, anyway).|`|kWjy7uzAaa	Guys don't really get together at slumber parties and talk about what their dream girl looks like, when we see a hot girl we want to hit it that's it. But there are hot girls that stand out from other hotter girls that's because their charisma and personality kicks in that separates them from the other girls, girls that just have something about them you know they are exciting, fun and mysterious. <br>  <br>    So I guess this would be my dream girl .

Part of celebrating our 16th anniversary.  Over 20 years together and everything about her just sets me off.  I'll tell you like all the others...it's not just about looks.  It's compatability, it's chemistry, it's comfortability.

94b8KImYaa	It is difficult enough to sell a house right now. Then is will be difficult for the children to have to move to another place. <br>  Then it depends what arrangements they had when they got the house (like a you take care of the outside, you do the work inside - or all the technical stuff)<br>  So he is just keeping his promises and at the same time making sure the house they want to sell is in a good condition to be able to sell it and sell it for a better price then otherwise. <br>  <br>  And, it looks like she is having the children - so he is also helping out them. <br>  <br>  I would not be worried or concerned.|`|u33x2hqzaa	I can appreciate your concern but if they are trying to sell the house it does make sense to me why he's sprucing it up.  Plus with children involved she will always be a part of his life, even if it's only chatting about the kids.  You gotta find a way to deal with & accept a man with a past like this.  Try to keep your focus on the relationship you have with him & making your time together as good as possible.  You can't control the rest.  Good luck in this relationship.  I wish you well.|`|djUMvICoaa	He can be doing it out of the kindness of his heart and to protect his investment.  Question is is he spending enough time with you or is he finding it hard to do that and you seem to come in in second place?  Then you have something to worry about.|`|AA12077420	Maybe he wants to do something nice to the mother of his children|`|0ox8VKwKaa	No problem here. Let it go|`|29hcn9JRaa	If you are already getting a sinking feeling from your boyfriends obligations, be it towards his desire to take care of his financial investments, or simply to take care of his family, this may be the time to find the exit door and run? because in this economy, that house will be sitting their for quite a while, also even when it does get sold your boyfriend strikes me as the type who will never stop caring for his family, and that is a great quality of his, however many women who get involved with men who are dedicated to their children and ex wives begin to at some point start feeling a growing resentment that starts out to be minor but progresses into rage. If you are the type of person who is not willing to share your boyfriend with his children and ex, then you need to reconsider this relationship, as it takes a certain kinda woman to be capable of understanding that while you are special, and while your boyfriend may think the world of you, you will never come first, and if he did put you first, dump him, as any person who puts their boyfriend or spouse on a higher pedestal then their child or children, is not a person who I would want to share my life with, nothing is more disgraceful then seeing a father of two out with his new girlfriend having a nice dinner with a expensive bottle of wine, while his children who he hasn't spent nearly enough time with, are at home eating mac n chz. So my advise is to really think long and hard about being with a guy who already has establised a family, and while I am certainly not trying to sway you into thinking you will never be valued in this mans life, as I am guessing you very much are? I am only stating that it takes a certain type of person to be capable of understanding and accepting the fact that it is not always going to be, all about you.  Good Luck Penelope
MFMaX2b1aa	Aww! Sorry that you're going through this sweetie.<br>  It's good that you're standing up for yourself, and you're right, he isn't your birth Father therefore he can't control you like your Father would.<br>  <br>  He sounds like a self centered bastard, who doesn't know what teenage years are. I'm guessing that you're in your teens and you're going through stages really wanting somebody. But when you come home, your step-dad looks at you like you're the devil!<br>  <br>  This has happened to me before too. I left my Diary open - and my Mom looked through it. She completely flipped about the things that I wrote about in there about my ex-boyfriend. <br>  <br>  It's so embarrassing! Anyway, as you said, he can't control you - and it looks like your Mom actually agrees with you, so go for your life and do whatever you want! You're a teen, that doesn't last forever!<br>  <br>  Just because you're not a old grumpy man like him, doesn't give him the right to judge you and be-little you.<br>  <br>  I had a similar situation, I hated my Dads girlfriend, she was a total skank! She told me that my Mom was a ***** and I said that she was a slut to her face, I hated that hoe! <br>  <br>  Anyway, keep your head up high and smile, because you're beautiful, keep safe and God bless! <br>  <br>  x|`|FoF1651raa	hmm..talk to ur mom  be honest with it

You can wait for her decision, or decide if she's that unsure maybe you two aren't a good match.<br>  <br>  Don't look for another girlfriend until you are single though. VERY tacky to line up a new chick before you're done with your current relationship...not to mention relationship hopping shows an unhealthy dependence on the part of the hopper.<br>  <br>  Try being single for a while between relationships...it's more appealing to potential partners, and more healthy for your emotional growth and well being.|`|bYaxOfWOaa	If she 'doesn't know' now, she never will.

The vast majority of people don't have half that many partners in a lifetime, much less before they hit 30.<br>  <br>  Using protection doesn't make the number bad or not bad...It is what it is. It's good you use protection, but get tested every 6 months anyway (condoms don't eliminate the risk, just reduce it).<br>  <br>  Number of partners is something that can quickly cause you to be judged by other potential partners. Don't discuss your number, just that you're disease free (back to getting tested) and that's all they need to know. You may well run off potential partners if they learn you've been a busy guy.|`|za9b8cHKaa	Yes, it's disrespectful to the women. You're treating them as objects, rather than an actual person with thoughts and feelings whom with you had a relationship no matter how brief.<br>  <br>  Sixty is a big number for anyone, let alone a man in his late twenties. I think it is time you grew up.|`|ABzyerQfaa	haha. i guess if you have used protextion with all of them then its ok, but it is a big number so i wudnt mention it in conversation, lets say, with a woman you really like lol. i hope ur planning to settle down soon tho haha x|`|Q2UDhYgkaa	It's called a little black book - some people have them. Well it's a lot of girls but you know the double standard - a guy is a stud and a girl is a sl*t|`|jX8qRYUDaa	60<br>  are you kidding me?<br>  that's heaps<br>  if you didn't say you were in the late 20's i would have thought you were atleast 50
YjByj5UOaa	so just give him some room. or just talk to him and telling him why aren't you guys talking. that's wat i did. i told him why he didn't and we started to talk more. just take it slow it's just a phase for him|`|Ge6WhCf7aa	it could be that he likes you, causing him to feel shy,<br>  <br>  or possibly he has grown tired of you and is seeking another girl?<br>  <br>  or perhaps you had done something that had affected him.|`|bYDluAw4aa	maybe he caught on to the fact that u didnt like him.......and maybe in a not so nice way...like from another person and not like he figured it out on his own......|`|nC8GRKxhaa	hey darl,<br>  <br>  sorry to sound mean, but i really think that you have over analysed your friends behaviour. Those things you mention are all pretty common things for a friend to do. But now because he won't say hi first, your abit confused. I honestly think, don't look into so much, because this guy obviously hasn't though about it too much. otherwirse he would be coming up and talking to you. As far as starting conversations, just go up and say hi, ask him how everythign has been. Your thinking because he usually does this, that becasue now he isn't, he has lost interest or doesn't want to be your friend. but really, i just don't think the though has crossed his mind all that much.|`|GgAClEQUaa	He bought you a soft drink! :O Wow it must be love! *rolls eyes*<br>  <br>  But if he does like you maybe he just got bored of being the only one to show interest, or maybe he is playing hard to get...
kWjy7uzAaa	hahaha your actually starting to believe the crap on here. Head back outside in the real world and see if anyone gives a damn about "confidence".|`|za9b8cHKaa	Absolutely.|`|AA11806027	you women you say that word without knowning what it means,you say nice guys aren't confident but they are themselve even if people don't like it,now you say that's being confident but when a nice guy does it it's not,wtf?|`|AA10408209	Well it's definitely better than being a whiny little turd who feels like crap about themselves...|`|LAbQy9d4aa	Only ugly people say that to cheer themselves up...|`|jXQEUxNpaa	Yes deff|`|FeftwHgQaa	HECK YES!!<br>  <br>  Guys always go for girls who are confident in themselves. <br>  They don't want someone who is always constantly vying for attention and worrying about their appearance. <br>  <br>  And not just guys, people in general. <br>  People want friends who are happy in themselves. <br>  They don't want to have to always keep re-assuring their friends that they're are pretty/handsome and always having to give them attention. <br>  <br>  So yes... the more confident you are, the more attractive you are. <br>  =]|`|6U25bcWBaa	hmmm...for girls, i think innocence is the best. Confidence is good but too much is bad. i'll suggest you to just give out a "no-nonsense" but sensible/intelligent and sorta image,  thats attractive<br>  keep your friend circle really exclusive (coz mostly, people r known from their friends), if your friends consider u special, thats an added bonus ;)|`|v7P6Cqp9aa	Defiantly ! Confidence is everything , when your applying for a job , when your dancing on that dance floor , when your in the bedroom .<br>  Have you ever noticed when all the guys are around 1 girl at a club , and she isn't even that good looking ? its because she is confidant !|`|ojmlL9hXaa	Yeah,  but it has to be just the right amount.  Too much can be very unattractive.  When it becomes cockiness, thats no longer good.<br>  <br>  But on another note, confidence can't make all fugly people look good.|`|QubdBy5Oaa	I can't explain it but yes i guess it's easier to find out more about that person is a bonus|`|yPX1E3Bbaa	in a way yes, i guess. if you are comfortable with who you are, people will notice it.
VYByhChEaa	coz u loves him<br>  <br>  age doesnt matter [lol]|`|21Wk2mu5aa	I would say you are definately looking for a father figure. You said yourself that you are still a daddy's girl to this day. So you don't want to give that up even though you have grown up. It feels safer to be someone like daddy.|`|AA11447210	Could be...just because your father is in your life, doesn't mean you don't want a partner in that capacity too (to take care of you, love you, guide you, baby you, spoil you, etc). If you are a daddy's girl it makes sense you'd go for a man to date who was daddy-like. You've moved from platonic daddy to romantic daddy.<br>  <br>  Most middle aged men who go for much younger women do it for the sex and youthful looks. It boosts their ego to be seen and desired by a 'sweet young thing'. The guys I've talked to that hook up with younger women have also told me they aren't interested in these women for more than showing off and having sex with. That's more common than the relationship actually turning serious...although it does happen (nothing's impossible in relationships).<br>  <br>  Chances are you two each have other reasons/motives for being together than simply having fallen in love. Large age gaps typically also have gaps in maturity, life experience, common interests, sex drive, where the people are in life, etc. Sometimes it works, more often it doesn't...|`|Ge6WhCf7aa	if so, it is the same reason you would be with a guy your same age.<br>  <br>  just be prepared he will age sooner than you will./|`|E9eQCm3Laa	yep...you like a daddy.|`|7JiichhVaa	no...age does not matter eventually, if u really think he's right for you and you know you love him so much and doesn't regard him as a father figure...then don't care about what other  people says...go for ur happiness|`|F32uPjAraa	I don't know, what do you think? Who knows you better than you.|`|bm0QrhD4aa	You should ask yourself what attracted you to him in the first place? Do you see some of the same characteristics in him that you see in your father? Do you get similar emotional satisfaction from him as you do from your father? These are questions that you should think about critically. <br>  <br>  But, depending on your past experiences, dating an older man might be reasonable. Women date older men because of the stability, their experience, and because most do take relationships more serious compared to younger men. <br>  <br>  Personally, I don't see anything wrong with dating someone older. Sometimes love comes in an older number, but you can't deny yourself that. Your relationship really isn't about what anyone else thinks. If it is a mistake as people might think, then it will come to light. Until then, keep doing what you are doing because it is making you happy.<br>  <br>  <br>  : )|`|JpG4zaA9aa	You may or may not be looking for a father figure in this man but in my opinion, most men at that age are more mature and looking to settle down. <br>  And...what 40 something year old man wouldn't want a woman half his age to have to show off?!<br>  So, he better be treating you like royalty and don't worry about what others are saying.|`|jnWBxFy2aa	you are old enough the realize what kind of a person you are<br>  <br>  its called self actualization and you are 23, get a life<br>  <br>  NEXT QUESTION

Most kids don't grow up the way parents wish they would,<br>   You need to leave her to care for herself. You are providing this life style for her, by giving her everything she wants, and making you feel guilty. There is no reason to end your life, ir feel depressed. You did your job, by raising her,and taking care of her. You can not control the choices she make in life. Your job as parents are done, she is old enough to live on her own.<br>  Sell your home, and move away, or put your foot down, and tell her all the help id done.

But just remember, you did your best, she failed herself|`|94b8KImYaa	My parents would have thrown me out of the house, changed the locks on the doors - and not open the door if I would come by - and if need would be, they would have changed their phone number.<br>  You deserve better than having a life like that.|`|WewCtMpzaa	It sounds like you gave your daughter a lot growing up, maybe too much. She is now taking it all for granted now, and even expects a home and money in return. That is called spoiled. Being spoiled is not a bad thing until you are ready to kill yourself over it.<br>  <br>  Once a person is grown to most extent, you have to let them fly and make their own life, mistakes and successes. Just because you gave her a good life starting out, doesn't means it stays that way.<br>  <br>  She will come around with some time. Just stop trying to give her the world at the expense of your own life.|`|JL0Pqw9Xaa	Forget her..Ignore her..please<br>  Shes her own being now..

The unfortunate thing is that greed has overtaken her and the expectation that you will always give.<br>  <br>  She sounds immature and her continuing to expect things is going to do nothing to help her be a self-relying person.

You need to cut her off completely. Use the law against her if you have to. It doesn't matter how old she is, she still needs to learn. <br>  <br>  Then you need to focus on putting positive energy into the world by doing good deeds for others. Volunteer to help other people. Do something good for someone else. There are always people in worse situations than ourselves. You have a lot to give to the world still. Just because your child is grown now, doesn't mean life is over. It's a natural progression.

0e8mlXveaa	I just finished with my boyfriend of 3 years for much the same reason. He wasn't maturing as he got older and was selfish so I felt I couldn't continue the relationship. I still love him and miss him terribly but if the relationship isn't going anywhere and you aren't making each other happy it's time to let go and move on. Don't start dating someone else until you have finished the relationship it's not fair on any of the 3 of you.|`|coqTBB6baa	Tough one! Seems to me that you want more out of that relationship than your boyfriend and if you think/feel that the situation will not change in the near future maybe you should try to force him to make a decision. it is natural that you want more after two years but if he doesn't want to commit himself then why bother. Of course a lot depends on how much you love him. If you feel that your love is strong enough to go on like this than maybe it worths to wait but if you are so uncertain about things now it might just get worse by the time. <br>  If you take interest in that other boy than go for it, but first you must come clean with your boyfriend and have a talk about these things.<br>  I dont kow how old you are but I guess you are mature enough for the next move and if he is not than it might as well just a waste of time to be with him.<br>  I hope I could help you decide with my opinion.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!

3NoQuoWuaa	No. child support is based on income of provider. The person paying the support would have to petition the courts for reduction or elimination of the payments and it is highly unlikely the courts would agree with the request.r|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	no your child support would not drop unless the person paying requests it be lowered through the courts. Child support is based on a % of the gross income of the person paying it. You getting an education or job training does not effect support at all. depending on what the court order reads, most support stops when you turn 18. If you are still in high school, support myst be paid until you graduate unless otherwise stated, evenif you are 18. If you attend college, support can be continued if both parent's agree to it (rarely that happens-most want to end support when you get out of high school) Also, when you do turn 18 and are through with high school, the person paying support has to show proof to the court that support should be terminated, until that is done, support is continued.|`|0CwLKWDgaa	Probably not be paid to you, but I'm not 100% sure
9EV86TLvaa	When people ask you. Admit to what you have done and deny what you haven't. People will then see that you are not lying because you are telling the truth and they will catch on because whats the point in lying about one thing and being honest about the next. People will catch on. Stay well away from the girl who is doing this. You are better than her and you deserve better. Move on with your life and if like you say she hates this guy in a few months time pay her no attention, don't let her get back into your life and do the same thing again. The truth will come out in the end trust me. Good luck I hope this has helped.|`|HJpHYpGbaa	You have the right idea.  Keep that tape recorder with you at all times and try to confront her at school about what she has been saying.

Hang in there, the truth will prevail!|`|trXjBRlRaa	Ditch the tape recorder. Ditch the girl. And own up when confronted about the things that are truthful about you. The more energy you put on this the more that the girl and boyfriend are "winning" AND the more likely people are going to believe her.<br>  <br>  Your friends are your friends. Period. Plain and simple. She obviously is a "sometimes" friend. A friend of convenience (for herself). Your best defense is just to walk away and be as honest a person as you can be.<br>  <br>  The police, that is serious business, but fortunately they are generally well trained to weed through the high school behavior and figure out what is going on. For your own good, just avoid her and her boyfriend at all costs.<br>  <br>  The question why may never be answered and that is the hardest part. It is the bleeding wound that is left to bleed. The only way to heal is time and literally moving on with your life. I am 40 and still have some of this same drama and have to physically remind myself that a relationship is over, the answers may never be answered, and I just have to let it go.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Have you talked to your own parents about this? It may be that your parents can find out what's been said, and help you sort this out. I would suggest that they contact the school first, to find out how and why she's trying to get you kicked out. I would think that if the school hadn't contacted your family about this already, they are not taking her seriously.<br>  <br>  However, judging by what you say about this girl and how many of your mutual acquaintances are no longer friendly with her, I would say that you don't have anything to worry about. <br>  <br>  Is she on drugs, by any chance?|`|uwaAcgyiaa	Dont do anything, and i guarantee that in time people will find out what she is like anyway, by her own actions, trust me on that, because the more you try to prove yourself innocent, the more you can look guilty.<br>  Just give it time and watch what unfolds
cd2ff6d9798215d0536899c2ea1dd9d5aa	You're not weird or stupid. I know you can't believe it now but that horrible, empty space you feel in your heart will eventually diminish. Hang with good friends, keep busy ( mentally and physically.) When love becons to you, follow him, though his ways are hard and steep. And when his wings enfold you yield to him, though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you. And when he speaks to you believe in him, though his voice may shatter your dreams as the north wind lays waste to the garden. For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you. Even as he is for your growth so is he for your pruning. Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your tenderest branches that quiver in the sun, so shall he descend to your roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth. All these things shall love do unto you that you may know the secrets of your heart, and in that knowledge become a fragment of Life's heart. But if in your sorrow you would seek only love's peace and love's pleasure, then it is better for you that you pass out of love's threshing-floor, into the seasonless world where you shall laugh, but not all of your laughter, and weep, but not all of your tears.

That is a bad place to be in.  Unfortunately, matters of the heart just take time to heal.  The best advice I can give you is to try to stay busy.  Fill all of  your time with something....that does not allow you to think.  Yes, it is beneficial to talk to someone especially to get things off of your chest, but when you are in a bad place sometimes it hurts more than it helps.  You did not say why you miss this guy.  If you guys had a bad relationship and can't be together because you broke up, then be strong and try to move on.  From experience I can tell you that holding on to something that has already gone wrong will only hurt more in the end.  I am assuming you guys broke up.  If it is something more complicated then that could really complicate things.  But still you can't focus on the sadness.  Do something you enjoy, exercise is really good...it helps you work out your stress, and it is great for your health.  Also, when you are upset it tends to affect your sleep (most people are restless and do not sleep as well) exercise really helps you get rest.  Hope the best for you.|`|7b6177ffccd38a7fe7428a728f8a79c1aa	Is he still alive?  What prevents you from seeing him?<br>  <br>  Great sex usually helps some.

lwXGNizGaa	My perfect partner would be about 5'5''-5'7'', 120 lbs, with an IQ above 125.  She would be from professional parents and raised in the suburbs of a large city of a state in the Midwest.  She would be incredibly cute at all times and breathtakingly beautiful when the situation called for it though she would rarely be described as "hot" or "sexy" because she would be slightly bookish and a little shy around new people so their attentions would only annoy her.  She would be someone I could stay up talking to for hours and hours every night and who loved to laugh and joke around.  Also, we would have years of friendship behind us and a network of mutual friends.<br>  <br>  The only flaw I would see in her is that she would sometimes be a little too dedicated to other things (projects, work, studies) to make as much time for me as I would like.  Of course, I would understand that sometimes certain things had to be more important than me but it would still hurt a little to be chosen second.|`|EAlIwQxCaa	the flaw i would pick is for her to be clumsy bcuz i think its cute wen like they all of a sudden drop something and you go and help it basically draws couples closer to each other|`|Wj7mBxFJaa	the flaw id put in would be too honest.  even if it meant i got criticized every once and a while.<br>  my last girlfriend was great, but she kept things to herself and would brood over them when i had no idea anything was wrong

There are good guys out there.|`|kwYbe4n6aa	ya sounds pretty horny if u dont like it just tell him to take it slow...|`|lVNYRSs8aa	maybe you're just too attractive<br>  <br>  ever thought of that?|`|za2IxgALaa	he ain't ready for your jelly-- <br>  <br>  i mean, he's not a mature dude, and guys are usually motivated with actions and they're not the greatest when it comes relationships either... women would have to work 2x harder to keep the relationship well and alive because men are extremely selfish like that and tend to think only about themselves and their own self-interests.|`|4TqadRJYaa	Sounds like this kid is in the relationship only to get in your pants.<br>  To find out you should cut him off for like a month to find out what his real motives are..|`|zrFzbDHUaa	he is a normal guy|`|sL5CY6Q7aa	hahaha i have been in that situation except im the guy. yeah i like just relaxing with my gf too. but ill always try to make another move just because i feel like she's wanting me to. but she has never told me to stop and just relax, so either im really good at timing my moves, or she agrees with me. hmm maybe he feels too tempted, so yeah in a way he can be too horny (but all guys are like that once they have been that far... so dont worry)|`|8oWlDoEyaa	So how old are you both?  Seriously - you've heard it said guys think with their *****.  Well, if he is between 15 and 22 or so, he can't help it. He gets hard walking past the lingerie section at Penneys.  Nothing you can do about it!|`|Waiiu3s4aa	Tell him to take it slower....that doing it all the time makes it boring....if that doesn't work look bored during sex...that'll get his attention.|`|AA10674018	what is your question? he's a guy... maybe you should break up with him. idk?|`|K8wDgNwbaa	buy him a rubber vagina|`|iUQFKuzgaa	get hin Egyptian Cotton Sheets, he'll love them more than you. there, problem solved.
HkXYGAOdaa	You told him you were kidding, but he is probably offended (not your fault though.)  The best thing to do is to text him and say you meant that sentence in jest, and are sorry if it has offended him in any way.  I think since he was sick, he didn't catch the humor in your text.  A simple text clarifying things should make it all ok again.  <br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|dXDroPtfaa	Lol, that's funny..He shouldn't be offended!<br>  He most likely fell asleep or was tooo weak to text you back.|`|fBqenlcbaa	He may have taken it a bit offensively, but then you said kidding so he might just be thinking it over. You should go see him to show him you care, and even if he did take it offensively then he will probably get over it.|`|I0JBGllLaa	He might've taken it offensively.<br>  Or, he's tired and sick so he fell asleep.
oHO0XOQVaa	Mmmmm... I would be scared to talk to him about it when expecting a child... It's difficult. Is a person who would do that to an expecting mother worth staying with? Maybe you can ask his parents or your own for advice? Maybe you can tell the woman's husband what's going on but tell him not to tell her who ratted her out... Then again... that would ruin her marriage and the kids' lives... It's really hard, I'm not sure.|`|5zw5I6xTaa	omg that's just mest up go to him as seen as you can and ask him whats all that stuff about and don't hold back if your having his baby then you have every right to ask
vhlORK4Waa	Love Spag Bol, but dangly bits of spaghetti with ragu sauce inevitably splashing and flicking over everyone's best outfits? You may want to serve something like lasagne instead?<br>  Have a wonderful day<br>  Halcon|`|C6IFaaEaaa	Hey it's your wedding do as you please.  However, spaghetti bolognaise is a messy affair to eat no matter how carefull you are.  It also depends if your wedding is casual or more formal etc.  If you have access to great beef, why not do medallions of beef with a beautiful red wine sauce, or individual beef wellingtons.  Or use the beef as a starter like carpaccio and have somethng else as the main.|`|q4tTabfjaa	Will be okay for all but the vegetarians and offending any of your guests is not on the agenda or is it?<br>  I recommend the pasta, the tomato sauce and the beef in meat balls to be added.  Grated vegetarian cheese at the stand by and salad garnish.  Label everything.<br>  Oh and a warning on the invite to the menu, so that they are prepared.|`|b1xQKDEraa	good idea, i had trouble choosing a meal as a lot of the caterers offered what I call complicated food and couldnt get their heads around a good, simple, hearty dish. i maybe wouldnt choose spagbol because it may be messy, but then messy is fun! however some people will make an effort with their outfit and you dont want disgruntled guests who have tomato stains on them. do a lasagne with some garlic bread. beautiful!|`|6nq1IiqXaa	yeah don't see why not, if its juts going to be relaxed.<br>  at my brothers wedding he had it quiet and just had bacon sandwiches and a buffet, so don't see why not :D|`|zRCj6zJtaa	it might ruin the weddin dress|`|N4vBc8Ogaa	It is your wedding, do what you want.  But remember that spaghetti is messy!|`|dtXzOGoKaa	i would only worry that the bride and guests could spill some on there outfits spagbol is hard to wash out x|`|B24W8w43aa	It's quite unimagative but a good staple recipe that most people like.|`|hsZnjZvoaa	Red sauce at a wedding always makes me nervous... BUT if that's what you want, go ahead and have it.  Make sure you have plenty of napkins on hand for your guests.<br>  <br>  Have you considered lasagna? It's layered and less sauce, so easier to eat.|`|L75kWYehaa	Sounds tasty - but it is a messy dish to devour, and would your guests want to end up covered in red splodges for the rest of the day and evening?  Something easy to eat would be ideal.|`|WyWHvUXJaa	oh i just love that!  my parents had it at their wedding!  go for it good-taste babe!|`|Fb3PMgD2aa	not best choise.. it would make a mess and souce around your mouth... not so pretty...<br>  <br>  maby short spaggety them..

He obviously couldn't wait.<br>  If you had to go bad, what would you do?|`|LgmvydIgaa	i would pretend like it never happened.|`|jmRq5xAfaa	I think you're making it a bigger deal than it really is. lol.  Just move on, it should be just fine.
cd8f30c22031713366cdb6b1bfaa4f5faa	simple and elegant|`|Jy6dFXjVaa	I chose a very elegant but reasonably priced wedding dress. My Daddy didn't so much as bat an eye at the price of my dress or the entire cost of our wedding because I was sensible about the entire thing. Our wedding was very nice, sophisticated, and elegant. My fiance and I kept the costs reasonable and we had a beautiful wedding. I didn't want my Daddy to have a heart attack when he added up the total costs and he told me he was so very proud of me for not spending an ungodly amount of money. Even if I had wanted to spend gazillions of dollars, my Daddy would have paid for whatever I wanted. <br>  <br>  So, in answer to your question, it would be that I found a pretty dress, it looked nice on me and my bridal gown cost less than my Senior Prom dress. I received lots of compliments on my dress and about our wedding, in general. People have told me all my life that I have excellent taste. My point is that looking elegant and feeling like a princess doesn't have to cost a fortune.|`|aipChC3haa	Me:<br>  <a href="http://media.photobucket.com/image/katie/squigglefish/katie.jpg?o=1" rel="nofollow">http://media.photobucket.com/image/katie...</a><br>  Dress:<br>  <a href="http://www.davidsbridal.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplayView?storeId=10052&catalogId=10051&catentryId=6087420" rel="nofollow">http://www.davidsbridal.com/webapp/wcs/s...</a><br>  <br>  I love how it just flows.  Super elegant and very princess-ey.  <br>  I really love it, and even though my wedding budget is 35K, I saw this dress and thought that the planned $1000 budget for my dress was ridiculous because I saw my perfect dress in this.<br>  And, it goes GREAT with my blond hair.  <br>  I love my dress =)<br>  But, if I do find something better (not likely) I will switch it.|`|h3NJO9dWaa	it really shows off my hourglass figure. Also I wanted one that had covered buttons down the back and the seamstress is going to add that instead of the zipper. My dress looks very French and expensive, but I got it for such a great price! I guess that's what I love the most, because I would be devastated if I found out it was like $4000 after trying it on. But it wasn't, and I love it.|`|YsiJiOqXaa	Well I am getting married on the beach and the train on it is lace so it looks so good on the sand. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.karenverena.co.uk/collections/bridalwear/alfredspring09/1614b.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.karenverena.co.uk/collections...</a><br>  <br>  this one but mine is solid white|`|6IHET4csaa	That I have never had one.|`|1KfbgBupaa	That my mother made it.|`|AA11333228	It fit like a glove.. only needs a little hem.|`|u6jP7BQNaa	I actually hated my dress.  I found out I was pregnant five months before my wedding, and had to settle for a dress that was not what i wanted.  It was pretty.  it was halter white dress with an empire waist to hide the pregnancy (but it drew more attention to it) and had an A-line skirt.  the only thing i did like about it is that I was able to have it custom made from one of my mom's friends.  She also attended the wedding in case I couldn't get into to it the day off.|`|xhUqLOJaaa	I still have to pick mine, but would love a simple but glamerous one, i'd hate to have an OTT dress that made me look like a merangue!|`|uyX6VP2Yaa	it makes me look smaller than i acutally am. i feel beautiful in it!|`|f2RpmfFOaa	it fit my boyish figure.|`|ECe1rgsdaa	The beaded red sash I got to go with it!|`|2o3BHgCCaa	How it is elegant yet still has modern WOW factor.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	its the closest to what I really wanted in a wedding dress.|`|7CKipTZOaa	the intricate beading and lace detailing|`|nkmwGAKjaa	It was a size 5!|`|pK1ImhaMaa	It was paid for by daddy! $4,000! =)
uP9M7Kzuaa	ohmygosh! im sorry that totally sucks! tell ur BF how u feel(that u think she might b lying cos shes jealous......) and be rlly open and honest. tell him that he should probably confront her about it and ask her y she wants to have the kid. if she cant answer that shes probably just jealous and wants to have something with him that you cant.(a kid)|`|Xg2WmhPSaa	Well that is something that your boyfriend will have to deal with.  Maybe next time he will use protection! Maybe all of you should get together sometime and try to resolve the issue together.  If she wants to have the baby he cant stop her & he should support the kid (not her, she needs to take responsibility too).|`|xtd2h5JTaa	Urrrr... Maybe u shouldn't of dumped him in the first place!!!!<br>  <br>  Or u shouldn't of waited so long to take him back!!<br>  <br>  U sound like a spoilt brat ;0)|`|CykUT9ceaa	Ok Hun, first of all, take a deep breath.<br>  <br>  calm down.  I know that it seems like your whole life has been ruined... but it hasnt.  It will all work out.. it always does.  Now, You obviously love you boyfriend, and he loves you.  You still have a wonderful future ahead of you, and it can work.<br>  <br>  You shouldnt feel bad or belittle yourself for breaking up with him, you were just making sure you were ready and that he was right for you... sometimes things happen... If you really love him and he really loves you then you guys need to sit down and go over your options together.  <br>  <br>  <br>  You need to #1.  Establish if the other girl is really pregnant or not. Get evidence!!! (PROOF!!) make sure that it is legitimate... I have been the victim of a girl claiming she was pregnant when she really wasnt.. its a horrible experience and really is a cruel manipulative blow...but you can get over it and move on. (remain calm and cool)<br>  <br>  Doctor visits: the best way would be to have your boyfriend go with her.. (yeah i know thats not cool, but its probably the only way to know for sure, talk it over with him, or maybe get permission to speak to her doctor about it, since if infact he is the father it should be ok). <br>  <br>   If she is infact pregant, try and establish whether or not the baby could be somebody elses. (might be hard to do before being born though)<br>  <br>  Now if she is really not pregnant, then you will have to be patient and work through this.  The other girl needs to realize that (if she isnt pregnant) that by even claiming to be pregnant she will not be able to get your boyfriend back.  She will only make her life, your life and his miserable.. which may be her objective as well.. Your boyfriend needs to make sure he is very clear(in a calm, respectful, very kind but firm manner) that he is through and you two are back together, and there is no chance, regardless of a pregnancy of him getting back together with her.  (dont mean to point out the obvious, but he really needs to know for sure that this is what he wants, with you two i mean, for him,you, the baby and the other girls sake.)  <br>  <br>  Now if she really is pregnant, well then your boyfriend is responsible, for whatever reason, (didnt use BC or it failed), if the baby is born he should be there, at least financially and emotionally for the baby.  No one should ever be forced to be with someone because of something like this, most relationships that start out this way end in disaster anyways.  Anyways, if the girl is really pregnant but wants to give birth to the baby but doesnt want to raise it, same with your boyfriend, then you should consider adoption rather than abortion.  You dont want to have that hanging over your boyfriends head for the rest of his life, its a huge psycological issue, or can be.  Adoption into a loving home with parents who want a child, esp an infant would be perfect.<br>  <br>  It will take time, and patience.  Now you need to realize that if this girl is really pregnant then she is probably freaking out because there is a person growing inside of her and the world is suddenly a scary place, and life/.. well basically sucks for an unplanned pregnancy, be patient with her and calm(if you are on talking terms, at least be calm and respectful) she is probably worried sick and half out of her head with the stress and emotional rollercoaster that is associated with pregnancy.  This can cause for alot of irrationality... just remember you love your boyfriend, he loves you and you want a life together, obviously it seems he loves you and the other girl is not right for him.<br>  <br>  BUT, Worse case scenario, there is a chance that the girl will give birth to the child, seek financial obligations from your boyfriend, and you two may have to wait awhile before having children to be able to support both of them..  I know you dont want to hear it, but you may  end up in this situation..but it can work out.. You may need to make adjustments, but by sitting down, making a plan, being patient<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S. - (dont do abortion, its a horrible horrible thing, unless its harmful to the mothers health, ~eptopic, dont let your boyfriend pressure her or influence/push her into an abortion, the other girl will have huge resentment issues and may try to seek revenge in some form in the future, you b/f will later have possible guilt/stress/psychological problems from it)<br>  <br>  IF this girl is really just planning to get an abortion but playing a sick joke... it is very possible,,, but you need to remain calm, and grow closer together during this time, support each other, take time out just to be with each other, make goals that you can acheive no matter what happens.. be patient.. it will work out.. it may get ugly, but it always works out in the end.... keep a good attitude.<br>  <br>  my 2 cents.. sorry its long.. hope it helps.|`|hy03VhVmaa	you should marry him and convince him to convince her that they both dont want the baby i mean u 2 are lovers now she can take that baby elswhere!!! you know what i mean?|`|e0dcce03a5934d3ac052cba2ba76fbb1aa	wow  this is a really hard place to be.   No one can make the decision for her as she is the one left with the choice if she is pregnant.  Unfortunately it may be an after thought.  Knowing that he could have used protection but didn't.  in the end it will always be her choice on whether or not to have the baby.  Unfortunately the baby is being used as a pawn for emotions and feelings which is really a very unpleasant thing to do.  <br>  If she wants the baby she will have it.  I really believe that your boyfriend should have a sit down conversation with her.  Allow himself to tell her just how he feels and both of them communicate what they feel.<br>  After that its a matter of her making a choice.  <br>  It is quite a situation.  One that your boyfriend and the other girl have to come to terms with.  Hope this all works out for the best.<br>  Using an unborn baby as a method of keeping them together isn't a good choice.  more thought needs to be put into these decisions.<br>  <br>  Dream|`|zJTBAeuOaa	unfortunately all i could say is that the decision to keep the baby is up to the girl. and as harsh as this might sound it isn't your problem. your boyfriend knows what could happen when you have sex. duh. i understand that you want to have a baby with him but right now what all of you adults need to do is think of the well being of the baby. the person who hasn't had a say in the whole situation.  the three of you will have to be mature about the whole situation. whether he wants to or not if she is pregnant he is the father and the baby deserves to have a dad. he might not be with the girl but the baby will still need him. and you would have to accept the fact that you will have a step child. if you guys decide to get married.  be rational and think about the person who doesn't have a voice in the whole situation.|`|ny94EXcGaa	I do understand what you are feeling, And you should definitly be PO'd<br>  but, no living thing does deserve to die.  And i know you dont like that answer but maybe he can convince her for Adoption.. AND, i think this may be some kind of thing where if she says she is pregnant than she thinks he will be obbligated to come back to her.  So,  this can just be some sick joke. shes pulling|`|QwNZsTaEaa	if u and ur bf are really close you'll get threw it soo just......hang in there.....she could be just playing a mean joke....or you could be kinda jealous of it cuz u 2 have been trying for a baby all ur negative feelings are coming out on it.ask your bf what he feels about it.....<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  lol im only 13 so i dont think i helped much please answer some of my questions<3

(  :|`|kwYbe4n6aa	wring ur phone number on a notes and give it to him after class... try seat near him... any college educated guy would know that u r into him..|`|hN08l7tLaa	u could write him a letter, or send him a text if you have his cell phone number.. ask him out for lunch after lesson, or perhaps some drink?|`|5ivLSWQPaa	Here is my ideas. You decide which one work best for you.<br>  <br>  1.Pretend accidentally run into him in hallway. Then say sorry and start conversation.<br>  <br>  2.Start a conversation with him by asking question that relate to physics lessons. For ex: Can you show me how to solve the problem? Then ask if he can give you his phone numbers and say next time if you don't  understand anything can call him.|`|kZtws4IZaa	You could stand out in class, answer alot of questions. But dont answer too many u dont want to seem like a nerd. Or try to start a conversation with him. <br>  Try hanging out with his friends to make him feel intrested in you or make him feel jealous by doing so.|`|vRc7ktcsaa	start in the simplest way. get his number to anyone of his friends or whatever, just not him, and start texting him. approaching personally will work but not in the best interest for the long term and it's too risky.|`|Ih6Bgggsaa	"accidently" bump into him when you are holding books and drop them. when he helps you pick them up, say the following:<br>  "thankyou, sorry i was in another world, he dont i know you, we have the same physics class... {insert proffessors name}... "<br>  when he says yeah i think so, or something like that say...<br>  "hi im {introduce yourselff and dont be afraid to smile]"<br>  when he tells you his name... tell him thank you for helping and quickly go off...<br>  DO NOT TRY TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION... leave him wanting more... remember he was in the midle of doing something when you bumped into him and when you take up too much of his time he may get annoyed.<br>  <br>  when you see him again in your physics class, then you can make small talk, like how was your day, hows your homework going... so forth.. but dont ask to many questions, have alittel bit of give and take. then one day while your talking see if he wasnt to go for coffee one time... slowley progress, learn more and more about each other, then oneday ask if he wants to sit with you... dont ask if you can sit next to him, if he wants to sit with you it shows that he has an interest in you... if he says that he likes his seat say thats cool. only sit with him WHEN HE INVITED YOU.<br>  after a while you can gather the signs from your friendship to see if he likes you or not.<br>  <br>  hope this helped.|`|9FlUlbYXaa	Ask him a physics question about something that interests you.  Whatever his answer is, keep him talking as long as possible.  After that, whenever you see him, make a point of saying hello.  He might start approaching you after that.  Then when he seems comfortable, ask if you can text him about physics homework.:)|`|obNNfiDzaa	First try to be his friend, sinply aproach him and introduce your self . if he knew you already try to start a conversation, light ones.<br>  Initiate the i want to know you better scenario. <br>  Start to talk about you ofcourse and you can eventually ask, how about you?|`|jvh7envpaa	Im still stuck trying to fathom you think you like him....but really know absolutely nothing about him<br>  <br>  <br>  Don't you really mean you have a silly infatuation?<br>  <br>  <br>  Hmmm how about trying to get to seriously know him better before you devote your feelings somewhere?|`|WG8mRVJnaa	hi this is easy after class just wait for him till he is alone and say hi start your convo and then good luck from there :D|`|9a36077aabd6b9387a198e4a650df3cbaa	just go girly..<br>  be like hey, my name is...<br>  whats urs??<br>  if he comes to u hes yours, if he doesnt, he never was...<br>  go for it!<br>  nothings impossible unless you dont try

YOFHIXMFaa	Leo, sadly enough many women prefer the "Bad Boy" image, leaving good decent men  out in the cold. Do a deep introspective of yourself, and you may see a patern emerging withn yourself that makes these women  attractive. Maybe you have a need to "rescue" women i.e, alchol, drugs, or just simpty dysfunctional.  Since you are 26, I'm assuming that the girls you've tried to hook up with must have some baggage or they likely would not be living st home.   I know that's judgemental for me to say, but often it's true.  Maybe they're shy, afraid ofcommitment, don't likr todate onlyone guy at a time.  Examine also hou they treat you: are they takers and you're a the giver! You seem to be a bright guy, very articulate, and you deserve a women who can hod her on (with bills, money, etc.<br>  But I can assure you thre's there'e nothin wrong with YOU youg man. Try set your standards high, then you''ll build confidence.

So just keep doing you and you'll find a nice girl who will truly appreciate you.|`|PyjZVn28aa	i think if the girl really likes you it wont matter what her parents think......how old are you???if you are young then dont worry about dating....your girl will come...but if oyu arent young..just keep looking...|`|ACGBj2liaa	big dilemma for you, someone will come along, until then date girls and have fun (not sex fun,     fun fun.

jeHTjvbaaa	At times yes, but it depends on your definition of selfish, is everyone not seeking please themselves to some degree in a relationship?|`|jGNktVXxaa	yes...selfish in giving up something to achieve a goal even oneself....|`|zNR9Ik3Daa	love never fails.<br>  if it fails, it is not love.<br>  love is never envious.<br>  if it is envious, it is not love.<br>  love never hurts.<br>  if it hurts, it is not love.<br>  love is good.<br>  if it is not good, it is not love.

Good luck!|`|QeX89rP2aa	maybe she doesnt want to seem desperate. maybe she really likes you, but she doesnt want you to know. it's like almost 5 in the morning here though, so if we are on the same time, she probably got tired...lol.|`|bJ57iaVuaa	Hmm.. That doesn't mean tat she doesn't interseted in you..<br>  Maybe she just haven't know you further..=)|`|QvhPJAKyaa	maybe she doesnt want to seem desperate and reply straight away. or maybe she just had something else to do, and only had time to go on for a few minutes and thought she would reply to you when she's next on. just dont keep thinking negatively.|`|mRgRDhMQaa	she might of had somewhere to go, had to go to wal-mart or just get offline?

wck4MHREaa	Oh ho ho...man, that is super-harsh. Especially if he's not joking about this.<br>  <br>  If he's joking...then he's a douche. Forget about him.<br>  <br>  If he's not joking...then he's a douche who's learned to move on with his life. Don't hate him for that, but do move on with your life as well. <br>  <br>  The best thing you can do right now is to just try to live your life; keep yourself preoccupied with other hobbies, friends, etc. It's ok to just take a minute/hour/whatever free time you have and cry if you like. This is the time that hurts- when something like this is unexpected. But you can't be crying all the time. Sometime you'll need to move on with your life, or else it'll move on without you. Only you can decide when you're ready.|`|XwMn6aY5aa	you should forget about him..yea seems like you been through alot and it hurts letting something go...but if you want to feel better you should just erase him[[well try]] there's guys that are willing to make everything go away and when you find one your going to shine again..there's plenty of guys out there not just only one that sometimes makes you shine and then takes it away you don't need that move on ^_^ good luck|`|ErmcT4uUaa	Its a trap !!!<br>  Don't fall for it.<br>  He is pure Evil and must be stopped.|`|AA11324847	I donno but I know how it feels to be left....and it's been a year and I still think about her...
rH4hN5QRaa	I'm a pretty easy going guy myself. In no way do i want to make your decision for you. I think a lot of this has to be a decision on if you like the guy in that way or not? I would sit him down and talk to him before deciding anything for sure. Get some answers! Why did he do what he did? Simply get some answers then go to what your heart tells you to do after that. This is my best advice to you! Good Luck :)|`|o9Gtf01Naa	Going out doesn't mean you will be together. Just give him a chance because everybody deserves a chance but don't fall too deep. Remember he lied to you before. Know your limitations and try to control your feelings. If you can't, its better to stay "only friends" and not "dating friends" with him|`|Ly1YUt42aa	history repeats itself,<br>  ur choice,<br>  if u do, u might get hurt, <br>  if u dont, u might regret it....<br>  <br>  if it was me, i rather just go alone with the i dont want 2 talk 2 u and find some1 else to love...|`|QKRHlpHoaa	No, move on.

Otherwise, stay away.|`|tpudBPTFaa	Do what you feel.<br>  But keep in mind, if he's lied to<br>  you before..He may do it again.<br>  Good luck !|`|o6tLojhlaa	no|`|MYPdlo1Iaa	It sounds like this guy is just interested in you when it's convenient and he has nothing else going on. Is that what you really want in a guy? Also any guy who lies about being with someone to another girl he's trying to get with is not the type of guy you want to be with. He did it to her, what's to say he won't do it to you? <br>  <br>  My advice, move on and find a new guy, and forget this loser. There's plenty out there to choose from... why settle for one who isn't totally crazy about you?|`|d7ihBw4Qaa	I would be careful with this guy since in the past he hasn't been trust worthy. Maybe the best thing for right now would be to just get to know him again on a strictly friend level, that way you can build your trust back with him. Don't rush into a relationship with him until you have that trust back and until you feel like you both are ready and even connecting on that kind of level. Good luck hun.|`|sGoEj6qsaa	Nope.  I wouldn't|`|Qfo4T5Edaa	no|`|XzsmYWOqaa	Don't waste your time on that LOSER!  Here are 2 things he might be:<br>  <br>  1)  DATING SOMEONE ELSE<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  2)  HE'S GAY!<br>  <br>  FIND YOURSELF A NICE GUY, THERE ARE MANY OUT THERE that will treat you like the Princess that you are. :)|`|AA10967686	no   sounds like your his fill in for when he doesnt have a gf.. why  because he knows you will let him.. no no no move forward  not back|`|HwjYCfLJaa	No|`|nxeQFPEfaa	noo0o0o0o0o0o...

You said she liked you but you didn't say you liked her.  If you don't like her, then break up with her.  That part is simple.  <br>  If you do like your gf but prefer your best friend, then you need to fish around a bit to see if your best friend likes you that way, otherwise you'll lose a gf and a best friend.  You could do this by asking what types of guy she likes, and if you fit that profile.  She wont think you are asking because you are interested, but it'll help you determine if you have a chance that way.  From that conversation, you can determine if you are right for one another in terms of her liking you.  But remember, sometimes having a best friend is great and a life-long thing, gf's aren't.
AA11447210	Only you can decide what to do, but a marriage is supposed to be a partnership and your wife doesn't sound like much of a partner. What you are okay with and what I'm okay with might differ...but I would find it unacceptable if I had to sell things to keep us afloat, when my partner wasn't willing to do the same, not seeking work, or not doing anything to help provide for our household and keep us from going under. I want a partner, not a lead weight to fight against.<br>  <br>  As for the daughter, she's an adult and has made her choices. She's got no reason to change if others are willing to let her sponge off of them and do as she pleases without contributing in any way (enabling her behavior/lifestyle). Tough love would be my answer to that.|`|jBigEy0Caa	Her daughter needs to check into rehab and not your home.  She definetly needs to hit rock bottom before she can change her life for good.  I have a cousin who has stole, and sold all of his belongings.  His parents finally have come to the point where they know they can not help him anymore.  They do for his kids and his wife.  Sorry you are going through this.|`|3fb8b435b3450d5a9fc426e41b6c4c72aa	As a male, I hear you.  My girlfriend has a daughter who is in her early 20's, makes $45,000.00 a year and still sponges off of her mom.  My advice is to break free.  Then again, it is really up to you.  The daughter needs to know that the reserve piggy bank (you) will not always be there, if you want to become a piggy bank, kiss your life and savings goodbye, sorry about the harley.  I'm extremely sorry to say that it sounds as if your wife is using you.  Your wife knows you will help until you go broke.  <br>  <br>    All due respect, you sound as if you have your life together and have done something in this world to achieve real estate ownership.  Don't let a druggie pull you done, you probably sympathize with the daughter b/c you are down on your luck right now, but remember one thing, you didn't have a choice. <br>  <br>    If someone was so nasty as to food, I couldn't stand it and would tell the person to leave my house.  <br>  <br>    Just to let you know, I'm not giving like you are, my girlfriend's daughter, the one mentioned in this response threatened to stab me in the blankin heart.  I called the police on her.|`|97b7d9795e7ae2ee4648b9cbb2fe32a4aa	your wife isnt much of a wife. and your right. her daughter needs to hit rock bottom, or she'll just eat up your money. put your foot down and tell your wife to make a decision.<br>  <br>  i could never imagine putting my mother and step father through this.<br>  especially with children. her daughter is outrageously selfish.|`|hCJ66msnaa	if you know there is no chance anything is going to change you need to get out now while there is still a chance to salvage your life. i can gaurentee nothing will change. ive seen this before and your wife will hit rock bottom before her daughter. you and your wife will end up with nothing just like her daughter if you take her in. you are right the daughter needs to hit rock bottom and nothing anybody says or does will change her and you cant make her get help until she is ready. hopefully for your wifes piece of mind it wont be to late. for the person in my life that this happened to it was too late and he ended up dying at 38 years old leaving behind two children i now have to take care of by myself although that wasnt any different than when he was alive cuz he was always drinking and doing drugs so i was taking care of them by myself anyway. its a sad thing when someone gets that way but there is nothing anyone can do. get out now while you have the chance to have a decent life and before you have nothing and are out on the street too i know its harsh but its really your only option trust me i know from experience. good luck to you and hope this helps
TpMoDiinaa	If it's true that you're only 13, I would definitely wait until you're of age, especially if you are dating someone older. That could lead to legal problems. <br>  <br>  Numbers in themselves don't matter. What does matter is what's right for you and that you are having sex (any kind of sex) because YOU want to and feel comfortable with it, not because of peer pressure, pressure from a boyfriend, etc. <br>  <br>  Wait a little longer, get to know yourself, and figure out what's best for you.<br>  <br>  <br>  BTW, the guys who say they "don't respect women who give BJs" are sexist hypocrites, because they disrespect women who give them but never guys that get them.|`|jeHTjvbaaa	Lol no they're not bad but I definitely do not give them!

K9MJwEVkaa	Has this girl been in troubled relationships in the past?  I think she is scared if she has had bad past relationships she probably goes into every new one thinking it will be like all the rest crap.  The think about saying I love you is it carries a lot of weight with it.  Theirs no time limit on love but be sure you mean it when you say it.  Maybe you should hold off on saying it for a while if shes getting mad and upset. If you truly care for her be there for her, let her know you care.  Give her a time to see, hopefully she will come around if she doesn't just remember there are plenty of other fish in the sea.|`|0hhfExzLaa	Maybe she believed you, but just doesn't love you back, so she is trying to talk you out of it so it is not as hard for you.

But the stats show that over half of divorced men remarry within 2 year and that number jumps to over 70% by 4 years.  The numbers are much lower for divorced women.<br>  <br>  My "starter husband" had an ex wife and a daughter.  I didn't "cash out," and neither did she.

Dear me...|`|fBso80Ubaa	First of all, you just answered your own question: "there is NO reason for a woman to not cash out from a starter husband".  This is why women still want to get married; if the marriage doesn't work out, they'll still make a profit.  We've seen it before, and we'll see it again; a woman marries a man just so she can clean him out a few years later.  We're not falling into that trap anymore.  And speaking of "trapping", we're now taking precautions of using protection at all times.  Another reason men don't want to get married?  There must be hundreds of "my wife doesn't want sex" threads on this site; they pretty much speak for themselves.|`|AA11447210	I wasn't aware men didn't marry.

It doesn't matter if the girl is pocha, gringa o latin.  If that's the case, that you do not look beyond what your physical eyes can see instead with those of the soul, sadly you will continue encountering women like these or worse in your life. It's all up to you....<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!

AA10545938	well this could be a major problem. i dont think you are ever gong to get over him unless you go out with him. you should talk to him about it and try and see if you 2 can get a relationship started. if you 2 brake up this will help you get over him bcause you will realize a lot more things abut him that you are blind sighted by since you like him so much. <br>  <br>  btw could you please help me with my question cuz mine is kinda the opposite cuz im the guy but it doesnt seem that we are as close as you 2 r.<br>  <br>  <br>  here is my question<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmnxQ3fA9uY1jDEw.wsZYQfsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307221540AAV983B">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  if you cant click on the link just copy and paste it into your address bar<br>  <br>  ty|`|mg6SReV7aa	Never cry over someone who wont cry over you..

Which one is it??<br>  <br>  How old are you??<br>  You must be pretty young to think that being with someone for two months constitutes some sort of commitment.  Most people are not like that.  <br>  <br>  I wouldn't even worry about it.  You sound like a great guy....actually sincere and sweet.  You are too good for a girl that would do something as shallow and selfish as breaking up with you the way she did....i guess that's a break up.  <br>  <br>  Just to be an a** and put her on the spot you should just ask her something about your break up....she seems spineless, so I bet she won't be able to tell you she doesn't want to be with you to your face.  Then you will have the opportunity to shoot her down.  <br>  <br>  Revenge is sweet.|`|Z3DsL9Bqaa	asif what a frikin *****. yeah you should be pissed off i would be. but show her what shes missing out on, just make her realise that you dont need her. by the sound of it you could do alot better, dont be mean to her tho cause she will think your really botherd and that shes got to you, play in cool yeah :-)<br>  <br>  hope i helped! x|`|FZ9a3dMnaa	That's pretty f**kin sucky!

If they arent that serious and were just little things, ask him if he wants to give it another chance. You never know if you dont try. If you just dont like him, you'll get over it then. It will take some time, but you eventually will. He may still like you if you broke up with him and he wanted to stay with you. He might feel depressed that you broke up with him. The best way is to talk to him and set things straight.  And I agree; that crap about young people not being able to feel real love and that they get over things fast is just stupid and stereotypical.|`|VqWBGWAoaa	You're 13 with high school grammar and punctuation?<br>  <br>  Aaaaaaanyway....<br>  <br>  We all Love at different depths.

To lose what you have made your entire world, for so long, can easily seem like the end of everything that truly matters.<br>  <br>  It is difficult to visualize a life beyond what you considered your existence in its entirety. To lose your passion/reason/drive for living/succeeding/smiling--That is, for some, a clear head-shot.<br>  <br>  <br>  To get over a heart break the best thing you should do is remove anything that reminds you of him to prevent a relapse, such as music you've shared, going to places you shared, mutual friends...

iJYtpvrBaa	this is an interesting situation because when your outside of school why dont you have a discussion with him like at a party you go to. nothing has to happen at that point just get into conversation about what you like and whats going on, keep that going for awhile. you will find out if he is seeing someone when you chat.<br>  <br>  next thing when your in school and your hanging with your mates and he hangs with his, if you see him in distance, just look at him from a minute, if he see's you and looks back and smiles for a second then theres something there.<br>  <br>  best not to speak in school if you can as people will start talking, see what happens outside of school. dont tell your friend, she'll just make it worse for you.<br>  <br>  you and this guy could have a good friendship or even more<br>  <br>  hope i helped|`|r2j2PgIBaa	Im sorry, I don't understand that story very well.|`|VABATohgaa	he probably doesnt but if he does... he proabably desnt want to amke a big thing of it cause hes with someone else.|`|j0aeAUs9aa	sorry to say this but no.

As time goes by, I'd recommend getting to know him better as a friend, and gradually starting to filrt with him more until he makes a move.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I'm sure it will work out really well for you :)<br>  If I helped, could you please consider sparing a few seconds of your time to vote for my school by clicking the below link?

You were definitely raised right to be thinking responsibly and to be concerned about her status. As for you being a virgin...that is not a crime..nor is it a sentence. You are a good person for waiting and there has to be a reason why you have waited this long. Remember that reason and do not act in haste simply because you have a buzz and you are turned on. see if the girl wants to meet you somewhere and then you can see if she has been drinking too much. If you hit it off and feel comfortable enough to go to her place then fine...that is your choice. But I would first meet in a mutual setting...just to make sure. Good luck.|`|8oWlDoEyaa	So, are you going to be a virgin the rest of your life just because you are now?   You have to decide, do you want to get it on with her or not, Thats all.  Don't be afraid..

Besides, developing a relationship with someone is more important than getting physical.

If it was for something minor, you might overlook it... though you can certainly let him know that you didn't appreciate what he did.  However, if it was for something major (and I would put sex in that category), you may be better off without having him as a friend.<br>  <br>  Ultimately, though, it is up to you to decide.|`|1uRUaSblaa	What happened precisely?<br>  Did you both have a talk in bringing closure to <br>  the matter?

You should talk to him.  That is the ultimate test of friendship.  If he is unable to talk to you about whatevery happened to try to make you feel better then you do not need him around.|`|AA11425983	Same thing happened to me awhile back. He said he still wanted to be friends..but...that was only one of the many lies he told me. He won't talk to me, look at me, or even acknowledge the fact that I still exist. And it's really hard, and it stings. I'd like to be friends, but when I think about it, this might be better. If we were still friends, I might still have stronger feelings for him. And to be quite honest..he doesn't deserve them.|`|RJPJy3OKaa	Its not easy to avoid if u think<br>  Be cool as like early<br>  every thing u do to avoid him will make him disturbed,<br>  its not good 4 u|`|uxsAL8sXaa	Leave em.

They'll definitely be conscious about their posture and the way they act. You'll find them trying to impress you, make you laugh, make you smile, etc.<br>  <br>  btw thx for answering my question :)
g7zDWqSTaa	How about a gift card / certificate to wherever they are registered?  They probably don't have room for too many boxed gifts, since the couple still plans to live with his parents.

hD5WSYbpaa	You have to let her cool off. Of course she is going to be mad. <br>  Although you meant something completely harmless it came across bad. Just wait a while then talk to her and say what you really meant to say. Just be patient.
FfeUtSU1aa	You have got to let him ease into it by himself. Ask for a night out once and keep the curfews. Then a little more after that. Get him to meet your friends. And seek out freindships with guys your dad would approve of. You know what I mean......|`|wT9KXIC0aa	I agree, trust is important. Maybe say to him, "let me stay out until 9 or 10 PM one night, and that will show I can be trusted."|`|vhy0k2dtaa	Gain his trust. It may take awhile, but have a LONG talk with him.

Not to be mean, but what kind of friend is that? and if this guy is using your friend for her body, will he treat you the same if you two were together? Think about it.

a7888a2850dcd5bad23ff441f00fa3e9aa	Okay, been there myself once or twice.  I find lots of luck in the situation when they flirt and play with you.  What I would do, if I were you, would be to ask to get together alone.  You two should go get something to drink and find a quiet place to sit and talk.  Joke around a little and sit closely, and just talk.  On ocassion, touch his back or his arm.  He'll get your interested in him.  Then put your hand on his.  This should get him to look at you, and just give him a small kiss.  Even if he was timid before, this will help him gain some courage and return the favor.<br>  <br>  You are a great girl, and you'll win this guy's heart.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  and let us know how it goes.|`|rrou7znnaa	Call him and ask him if you can talk to him in person, alone. And tell him your feelings, don't be afraid to do it in person. Tell him you like him alot, and it feels right when you're with him, but make sure you tell him that you'll understand if he doesn't feel the same and tell him that you don't want to lose his friendship no matter what happens between the two of you. Best of luck<3|`|rcQgfKPTaa	go for it.<br>  sometimes guys dont know how to send the right signals lol.<br>  but def. take a chance....<br>  <br>  hope this helped :)<br>  p.s. best answwer.|`|9DHsCRC2aa	okay...look.....heres da deal........if u like him u shud just tell him......im with a girl...i got her to dump her bf (you can find the whole story on the ? where she asked about breaking up the guy and some girl) so she dumped him......she has been my friend since kindergarten....and i am in seventh grade (13 years old) and we went out before to...when we broke up we didnt loose a friendship.......and we are back together now.....so u see.... kissing her even before we went out wasnt hard....just when it feels rite, but not in front of a buncha ppl...lean in and do it<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  AND PS<br>  <br>  CAN U BELIEVE THAT TEN YEAR OLD KID!!!!

0aaa10bf1334628de7df8d1527e7a5a7aa	What does the term 'good friend' mean to you? You need to take a step back and do some serious thinking.  Who's most important, the friend or the girl? What if you need to chose one or the other? Even if you don't, the only way you'll end up with EVERYBODY happy (and it sounds like that might be difficult) is if you act with a degree of integrity.

Xkq5kHLNaa	I wont ever forget him.. but my love for my husband is a purer, deeper love. I cherish it, whereas my first love is just a fond memory:)|`|fh2taCkvaa	no you can never ever forgett your first love <br>  <br>  i wrote this about my first love who didnt love me back it was my best friend .... <br>  “If you trip over love you can always get back up. If you fall in love you fall forever.” (Anonyms). <br>  Side by side we stood, our eyes meet like the sunset meets the peeks of the mountain at the horizon. Our hearts beating in unison. I felt nauseous, like my nerves were eating me up inside; my hands clammy. I had to tell him something  but I didn’t know how. <br>  So I just took one deep breath which broke the silence between us like an 800 pound polar bear breaks the ice. “I love you,” I said nervously. I waited for an answer or a comment but I could see it in his face that he was clueless as to what to say or what to do. He looked up with a tomato red face and walked away. I stood there in a crowd but I couldn’t hear a thing. I could see mouths moving but they were on mute. All I could hear was my heart beating. I watched as he slowly vanished into the distance. I wanted to go after him but it felt as if my feet were super-glued to the floor and I couldn’t feel my heart. I didn’t know what to feel. I had a thousand thoughts running through my head. I felt like crying. My eyes got red and puffy, watery, and I started to sniffle, but I held them in. My heart dropped down to my ankles and I couldn’t feel a thing. I was delusional about what had just happened. <br>  I had just said “I love you” to my best friend of three years whom I liked and LOVED dearly. I didn’t know what had just happened. I didn’t expect him to say it back but I had to tell him how I felt. If I didn’t, my bottled-up feelings would explode like a bomb during World War One. I liked him so much that Whenever I saw him, I went numb and I couldn’t help but giggle. I was truly in love.. I truly believed that I was lucky to be in love with someone as great as him. We connected on a personal level. We liked each other, we spent every minute of every day together. We were so close we could be called one. We knew each other better than we knew ourselves. He was my other half, like the “cheese to my macaroni”(Juno). <br>   I still keep wondering what I did wrong, what happened, why did it happen like this, where did we go wrong? A lot of people told me I was too young to know what love is, but I don’t think there is an age for when your suppose to fall in love. Albert Einstein said ,“You can’t blame gravity for falling in love.” When you fall you fall hard and it isn’t easy to get up. Most people don’t know what I felt it’s a feeling that you can’t explain. Love is a beautiful thing but it is very complicated matter and you can’t help falling in love, it just happens. Love can also hurt if you get heartbroken like I did.  That afternoon I went home shocked and so confused. I texted him, “Hey what’s up?” I said. He didn’t reply. It was 5:00 pm and still no answer. I stayed optimistic. I was thinking maybe his phone was off, but maybe he has bad signal or maybe his phone is dead. I didn’t look in to it too much. I thought everything was fine, he just needed time to take in what I had said. <br>  I got ready for bed and before I slept I sent him one last text, “Good Night sleep tight don’t let the bed bugs bite.” When I woke up the next morning I anxiously grabbed my phone to check for my every day “Good Morning Sunshine” text that he always sent at 7:45 sharp. There was nothing there so I quickly got dressed, ate, and brushed my teeth. Faster than you could say go I was out that door. When I got there he wasn’t waiting for me in our usual spot. Hmmm, how strange I thought. “Maybe he is absent”, I said. So I walked on over to my English class. The atmosphere of the class was unpleasing like usual and I never really did learn anything that year. The teacher was  horrible, mean and sluggish. The class was small and he sat there, the big hawk watching us his prey. I walked in and greeted him very politely as always, even though I hated him with a burning passion. He said hi with a harsh tone to his voice and hard stone eyes. He followed me with his eyes as I walked on over to my friend. I greeted him with a “Hey did you get my text?” he didn’t reply. I stood there for a second and though that’s rude and I walked away. That period was hell, it seemed like it would never end, I kept eyeing him but he never once looked up. Summer came and we still hadn’t talked. I would occasionally text him, apologizing for what I said but why should I be sorry for falling in love? After all those text there was  never a response. I finally gave up after almost three months of crying myself to sleep thinking about him and how our friendship could never go back to how it was. Summer ended and school began. It is hard for me to look at him walking past me every day. I would try to say hi but my mouth won’t open. We are now two strangers living in a strange world. Some say that people who are in your past now weren’t meant to make it in your future.

0e23d00ec882aacec2be181edce9b2e1aa	First of all it sounds as if she is very young, if not in years, then in emotional maturity therefore is not capable of a serious relationship at this point in her life. <br>  If you have to question her behaviour now what will it be like in a relationship.
3EM66IWFaa	Even though she is buying things by her own money, she thinks your opinion is most valuable, that means you are some special for her.When she asks so tell it is nice, beautiful but why are spending so much money for fancy items. Sure she will be pleased.
FUNhlpiqaa	It could really complicate things.  I started dating my now husband while he was separated (have to be for one yr. in NC before you can divorce) and things just got messy.  Your best bet would be to wait till you guys are officially apart.  That is unless he starts dating... then if you meet a guy who doesn't mind your situation, go for it.<br>  <br>  btw, my husband wasn't living with his estranged wife.|`|FewhKlx9aa	Talk to the lawyers ,this can be sticky.There are many couples living together due to the economy so yours is not unusual|`|c2c3a447ca6a35c94ffed12e17bf8913aa	I would wait to date.. messy for many reasons - But ESPECIALLY for the children.  There are more important things than your next conquest!!<br>  <br>  PS when i was separated, my attorney told me that sleeping under the same roof could interfere with a legal separation.|`|AA11447210	Some states require a period of separation before divorce can be granted. In legal terms that typically means "living apart" (check with your attorney).<br>  <br>  As for your personal choice in the matter, you can call yourself 'separated' if divorce is pending but you live together, if you two are emotionally separated. However I doubt many potential dates would find it appealing that you still live with your husband...as that increases (in their mind) the chances you two may reconcile.<br>  <br>  Might be wise to save dating until after the divorce is final, if you two aren't going to make arrangements to live apart and move on with your lives, while waiting for the divorce.|`|gVITlOMUaa	Yes, you can call yourself separated for all the reasons you mentioned above but it might be best to wait on the dating until you two are divorced or one is out of the house. It is just my opinion and you don't want something held against you in court( you never know) so personally I would be on "best behavior" til the divorce is finalized|`|Wv592rOqaa	When you filed for a divorce depending on the reasons, there should be an affidavit of "legal separation" - or have the document amended as such.  <br>  <br>  You are still legally married, but if your husband agrees to the arrangement then there should be no issue - however, I would not bring my dates home as that might be disrespectful to your dates in particular and could make them feel uncomfortable - or get the wrong impression about you.  <br>  <br>  On the other hand, if you do not mind waking up to a naked woman walking across the kitchen to get coffee because she is your husband's date, then I guess you both can live with this type of arrangement?|`|y4SUDnpaaa	You can do anything you want as long as your and your husband consider yourselves separated. But I think it is a terrible idea. You are setting a horrible example for how a marriage should work and an unhealthy atmosphere to raise him/her in. What a confusing situation for a child.........the parents don't speak  except when absolutely necessary. How can he/she comprehend your separation when you are still living together. To add salt in his/her confusion now you're both going to start dating. One  of you needs to move out, even if it's with family or friends. btw If  you can't even afford to live  apart during a 'separation' how in the world will you both manage being divorced.|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	The economy has dictated this new kind of separation.  Saw a segment on one of those magazine shows and the wife and husband were divorced but still shared the house because of the economic turn down.<br>  <br>  Google it and see if you can watch a clip of it. It was either on NBC, FOX, ABC or CBS -- can't recall.  You might get some inspiration or not.|`|4CebuvRhaa	till the time you are married you can't call your separated however when you are in court and you get decree for judicial separation you can use that term...but you should not be dating till you get a decree coz your husbands lawyer might use it against you and you might land up in soup.|`|gRXy66dOaa	yes you can<br>  as long as you dont sleep in the same bed|`|aErUKUvVaa	Date at will.... but just don't bring the other guys home with u and flaunt them in front of him, unless u want him to do the same..... capiche?|`|jBigEy0Caa	You should hold off on dating until your divorce is final.  He needs to get his own place.|`|qeNrGoMsaa	Unless you file for separation papers you are not separated in the courts eyes. That's a legal point of view.|`|v8lSuNQzaa	Do not bring your dates home. That would just be bad all around.|`|poIP8roRaa	Most of the responses are spot on in my opinion.  Hold off on dating until your divorce is final.|`|yBBjTVQaaa	Emmmm....yes I would say so. However you could get a document that means you are legally separated if that makes you feel better. You can do that with a lawyer or a DIY one on the internet for about ￡30. I suppose it would depend on how the person that you are dating feels about you still living with your ex. I don't think that you are doing anything wrong. Also people have to remember before they judge you that it is not easy to cut yourself away from someone quickly if you have financial ties. I think that you should do what feels right for you, whatever you decide there will always be someone that has something to say about it, but ignore negative comments and just concentrate on making yourself happy. Good Luck x

Who knows when you help one of them they may start liking you.<br>  How can you move on when someone is getting hurt.|`|8IyZphFVaa	oh my God you are acting like a freaking sociopath. I'm happy you posted this question b/c at least it shows you see something wrong with your behavior. You have to take responsibility for your own life and treat people as individuals. With ANYTHING that is going wrong in your life you need to focus on yourself and what you can do to change your situation. Think about what you are doing that is causing you to have bad experiences with women. Maybe you tend to approach a certain kind of girl. Or maybe you are rude or awkward or something. That isn't anyone's problem but your own. You're generalizing and assuming that all girls just choose to go out with jerks because, obviously you're not that kind of guy, right? That's a defense mechanism. And you should know life isn't that simple by now. Focus on yourself. Look inwards, be a positive loving person, and people will come to you. You won't have to put effort into getting girls to like you.<br>  Do you realize who you are or how you come across? I mean something's wrong if you have a friend that feels comfortable to beat the crap out of his girl right in front ot you. Something's wrong if you are capable of not feeling sympathy for someone who is helpless. maybe girls who stay with guys that are abusive are stupid but in that moment they're helpless. they could have died! and here you are pointing the finger at women? i mean why the hell would any girl be attracted to someone like you, sitting around feeling sorry for themselves and putting the blame on other ppl for their own shortcomings?<br>  And as for girls "getting what they deserve," you don't know these girl's situations. You have no idea what they could have gone through. And that's the problem with you. You generalize. You don't see people as individuals. You only see yourself as an individual. I have a friend who was raised in a household with uncles, family friends, all kinds of strange men who raped her. She was only 10 years old being raped in her own house and nobody did anything to help. I grew up being abused. This is what some people go through. And then when these girls grow up with a warped sense of right and wrong, being promiscuous and whatnot, people want to call them sluts or idiots and say they "deserve" this and that. Nobody deserves that crap. I'm sure you wouldn't like it for me to judge you and call you a loser or a jerk and say you "deserved" to be rejected. I don't even know you. I don't know why you are the way you are. All I know is that you did something very wrong and I hope you get your life together and stop pointing the finger at other people.|`|OeGcRJ6Xaa	you're a straight up a$$hole. so you've been rejected- who hasn't? stop being cynical and get over it! turning your head the other way- while some girl is being beat NOT COOL. you should've and should intervene = human decency. maybe those girls would've seen that a real man doesnt need to hit women- and might have dumped their a$$hole boyfriends- and who knows maybe would've given you a chance- or told their friends that you're a nice guy for helping a stranger like that... you need to get over the past.
y2Uks58paa	yeah you should ask him. just make it clear that yall are going as friends, and he will be more likely to say yes because its a lot less pressure and more layed back just going as friends.
O7bkO6pnaa	It could be somewhere where you'll feel easy to express to each other and where it could unforgettable,|`|0BrVE2nvaa	Definitely NOT the cinema! It doesn't give you any chance to talk or get to know each other.  A meal usually goes down well.
Fllrx2Xsaa	no way.<br>  I am 5'5 too and my boyfriend is 6'5, and we look darn cute.<br>  he just has to bend down a bit or I stand up on a step. People just think you make a sweeter looking couple!|`|D5zxTZOKaa	its not that weird when the chick is the short one, it kinda makes it cuter, just more complicated. lol<br>  i was about 5'2" when i dated a 6'2" or so guy, so he was tall! sure, it was a little hard for me to kiss him since my face met his chest, but i could always attempt by putting my arms around him and standing on my tip toes. he'll catch the hint and do the rest! make him do the bending down or lifting you up, whatever suits him.<br>  trust me tho, its not awkward, if anything its more entertaining and fun! =D<br>  <br>  luck to you.|`|jeHTjvbaaa	That's not a huge difference.  One of my ex's was 4'11 an that was a little awkward because I had to bend down so far.  5'5 and 6'5 isn't going to be too much trouble for you at all.|`|lVNYRSs8aa	i'm like 5'10 and usually can kiss any girl between 5'6-6'0 without problem<br>  <br>  anyone shorter i like to lift into the air first before doing anything|`|UUrqECXIaa	No, it would not be strange. I had a bf once that was 6'3'' and I was only 5'2". I've grown a couple of inches since then, I'm 5'4" and my husband is 6'1".|`|rrou7znnaa	No. My boyfriend is 6'2 and i'm 5'2. <br>  He usually sits down and i sit on his lap to avoid bending so much hahaha. or he could just pick you up to kiss you :)|`|uxVIlXlvaa	i knew a girl around 4'11 who was dating a 6' dude. its like she needed a step laddar to kiss him!<br>  <br>  and to answer your question, i think nothings wrong or awkward with that.|`|4dtUsaYhaa	im 164cm tall and i couldnt kiss a guy shorter than me - it would be very awkward. he needs o be taller then me i think|`|d9eNWYlyaa	i think its super cute when you have to tiptoe to kiss somebody<br>  <br>  i think its fien<br>  it wouldnt be akward at all :]<br>  <br>  hed probably bend down and envolope you in his arms with u tiptoe-ing or something<br>  <br>  <br>  also. when u wanna be fun<br>  <br>  a quick kiss from u jumpings always cute.|`|95211d0e5eb98a4a0fdb5680545d4d06aa	I'm actually 5'5 and my guy is 6'5 and if we're standing up kissing IS difficult. Other than a quick peck, I need to stand on my toes and even so my neck starts to hurt. He has to lean down and tilt his head a bit too. Our solution is kissing while sitting or laying down, it's much easier|`|n46fsdNZaa	honestly who cares what anyone else thinks if you are happy with him be with him.  If you want it to work you will make sure it does no matter the size differential.|`|8561fe0c5f5e506d723b08ec7c42e4e1aa	well it's not weird since your a girl and the guys is old but if you were the tallest in the relationship then yea it would be strange|`|UeA5EpVWaa	no thats how it is alot.  the girl is alot shorter than the guy.  it won't be awkward unless you make it awkward|`|I96VRgmNaa	NO<br>  I like any freakishly gorgeous girl.|`|bwPFUzURaa	no not really, I'm 5'11" and my fiancee is 5 even does not bother us any|`|t7OPDZDXaa	no not at all, you could sit on his knee or stand on something... his feet or a stair.
6Nuaqihpaa	Of course. It's always important to wait for love to come to you rather than you going out looking for love.<br>  I've tried that, and it just ended in disaster every time.<br>  So be patient and have fun flirting!<br>  <br>  Rachel :)|`|e640e5fc04f1c4da3326c5429e707bdcaa	No. Often we forget that love starts with our spirit, simply because our world is based on what we see, touch, hear, and feel, and intellectually understand. We get disconnected with out spirit, our core heart of heart that is all about love. All pain suffering fear is a symptom of the lack of love --- the disconnection. <br>  So sometimes we lose what we think is love, and suffer so very deeply until there is nothing left to do but to look at our patterns and seek what it is that is keeping love apart from us. Of course, it is a part of every human being...it is a matter of taking the past and re-framing what has happened in a positive light that is meant to lead you to your eternal spiritual rooted love, Once you find it within, you will naturally radiate this and attract a like-minded partner. <br>  If you resist, either through ignorance or naivete, then you will attract those who are like-minded and are also suffering.|`|AA11447210	I am right now, in a way. My lover's life changed so that relationships were put on the back burner while he did some things he needed to do for himself and his career. I respect that, but hopefully the time is coming soon for a closer look at us and what our future together may hold...I feel the potential for love, I know he's very interested in me so hopefully he feels the potential also. We shall see.. ???|`|0SREhTB2aa	You know at a young age, people go through many relationships to find love.<br>  Its all about luck.<br>  If your lucky, you will find him in an early stage but if not, then yeah, you'd have to go through the same procedure as many of us do and that is going through lots of relationships.<br>  You may find love in some of them but the kind of love that doesnt last.<br>  You may get hurt in some of them but you always get stronger after each relationship.<br>  But yeah hun, we all have to wait for love. If your lucky, love will come to you. x|`|ttgYqLdDaa	You know they says true love waits?<br>  Everyone has to wait for love, Its just a matter of time when they find that special someone.<br>  And when you do, you are sure that thats true love.|`|2EdVsgciaa	hmm....it took me 16 years and 19 days to find him<br>  ...not too shabby lol
IPS3hWweaa	Hey, you're both in the same league! Go for it man! and don't worry about what other people say. If you like each other, don't let jealous people's opinions stop you.|`|KOXcw4klaa	go for it.|`|PyRxe9B2aa	There is no way to tell without knowing both of you. LOOKS do not tell if you make a match or not. Many times you look at a couple and they just don't match. When you meet them the good looking one of the pair could be dumb,  and the ugly one could be the smartest and nicest person you ever met. There are many aspects of personality that come into play and making a perfect pair is like putting a jigsaw puzzle together. Give her a try.

N7gOE1btaa	To the same extent that askmen.com operates, there is nothing for women.  This is because women have a large library to choose from--such as cosmo which you mentioned.
N7gOE1btaa	You need to be confident or it will get weird.  When you see him, approach him and tell him you had a great time the other night.  That will break the ice and you can talk about whatever from that point on.  If he seems a bit bothered by you or nervous, then say you are sorry if you came on a bit strong but you have admired him for a while now.  Just make sure you do it the next time you see him, otherwise it'll get awkward with each passing minute, hour, day, week...
1QSsOAAFaa	Well, it's not rational, but being treated badly in a relationship is not always enough to end it. Abuse is often separate from someone's feelings. This is something I never completely understood either. I don't think there's an answer for that. She likes you but just likes Chris more. People can try to explain why they love each other, but there's really no "why."<br>  As for her parents, they think you likely saved her life, and you did. Imagine what would've happened if she was alone. So whatever reason they disliked you before was petty compared to that. <br>  The best advice is for you to move on if you can. Not a perfect solution, but that's all I got for you.
iQ3g5OTKaa	Go into rehab. 2 out of 10 people maintain being clean after rehab. It will not be easy for her. She will have to change everything about her life. The outcome will be a better person. I have had personal experience with this issue. Before meth was invented. 27 years later and still doing well. If I can anybody can. I was so low I had to crawl up to live a rewarding life today. No regrets.<br>  Good luck
1FbuoLAcaa	I'm actually in the same situation. People that I asked about it said that she liked me because a normal girl wouldn't get squirmy when you look in their direction. I know because there are girls that don't like me and they don't get all squirmy when I look in their direction. I think she likes you and is afraid to talk to you.
PrKLoajAaa	anything goes here in Oz olny you have to be 16 to have sex nothing wrong with 5yrs (go for it, go for gold)|`|4dtUsaYhaa	once 16, you are able to have sex. i dont think anyone can do anything about it. i guess you may try and get some parents fight it if their child is under 18/.|`|ZRS6V6Rcaa	sydnee, ok...<br>  <br>  why is that important to you? if you live there you should know|`|iUQFKuzgaa	rule #1: do not date kangaroos.<br>  rule #2: intercourse with a kangaroo is strictly prohibited (aka. not ok)<br>  <br>  does that answer your question?|`|8Q5WlMV1aa	okay that just SOUNDS gross.
RXe4guclaa	he thinks ur hot but he doesnt want anyone to know cuz he could get fired for it.|`|AA11363680	He's a pervert and is waiting to see your reaction. It's possible he didn't plan it, but either way he's on thin ice.<br>  <br>  If you're not willing to get him in trouble over this, I'd suggest you write down exactly what happened, date it, sign it and keep it safe. Ideally, you should send it to yourself by registered mail so it's officially dated, then keep it sealed. Then if he does anything at all that is suggestive towards you, tell someone about all of it.<br>  <br>  One incident might, might be a fluke. But if he pursues the matter, he's a pervert looking for some action.|`|V5AliBPMaa	That hes going to rape you one day and hes going to end up in jail soon.|`|a87POYvAaa	woah there girl/guy. teacher-student relationships are just wrong and even wronger if youre underage and hes above 18|`|0xGtNdveaa	That he just committed a felony and you should report him to the police, your principal and every form of authority before you get into some serious trouble. This is wrong in every size shape and form. Dont get caught in something that will mark you for the rest of your life. Seriously tell everyone. He violated all the rules of his teaching job and if you are under 18 years of age, that could be seen as statutory rape.|`|xufESx85aa	It means he doesn't want to get in trouble for what he did.<br>  <br>  If you don't tell an adult about this he could try to take it further. Things could get really serious. Next time he might try to feel you up. If you let that slide he might try to rape you.|`|dD1zIe9aaa	he really likes you boy! all you want to do is to find out the reason why she pecked you on the lips.|`|AjPbtm7oaa	It means you have a good imagination.|`|pE2cZNQQaa	as above<br>  olivia is right|`|OB8KPPIQaa	oh wow... you dont hear this every day... well he wants to keep it a secret so he wont get in trouble... i guess he likes you back?|`|VauuLYHaaa	careful with that. this could be sticky|`|q6NSzY2faa	just do it|`|mxrYe9qMaa	He doesn't want to get fired.|`|jbxgc8GQaa	agree|`|xiOu1O5baa	this is what you do, meet him in his office and let him rail you....|`|ErmcT4uUaa	I heard about him.<br>  You better watch out.|`|gYuJUyvvaa	He's a Pedophile, TELL SOMEONE
37M3dkkRaa	i wouldn't be jealous, i would be freakin pissed. she has no right to call him by a pet name if they're not together anymore or if they're not friends. he's YOUR man now, tell her to back off.
N7gOE1btaa	Your boyfriend is out of line being friends with his ex-gf if it bothers you so much and also if she is calling him pet names.  That means she is hitting on him and he is allowing it.  You need to let him know he needs to grow up and get serious about you.  If he thinks you are being childish he is just being defensive.  You have every right to be jealous and annoyed.  Plus, how do you know she is so amazing?  Does he brag about her to you? If so, you can do better than him.  Sorry, I know its not what you wanted to hear, but sometimes honesty is the best long term solution.|`|QqQkLrGsaa	You need to tell him its either u or her. Because she shouldnt be giving him stupid pet names and such. They have history so dont be naive about it
e0cc9d2682ebd6e29abf1e7965f59ef9aa	Take a chance and ask her out, the worst thing that can happen is a rejection which we all go through. We all learn somehow. First off, figure out what she likes, what interests her, find a little bit about her somehow so you can engage in a conversation with her. Try flirting with her, don't try too hard,make her laugh a little and be confident. Keep your head up high, have a smile on your face when you approach, look sharp, well groomed to stand out in the crowd, be yourself. Don't brag too much because it can sound conceited, just be unique and have a great personality. Make her want you by you being different from the other guys.|`|vHhap9yoaa	1...just be there for her when she needs someone and keep up being the funny guy who makes her laugh...also, be yourself and natural..<br>  2...like you were on this question, be blunt, go ahead and ask her! i am sure she is waiting :]<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  -prec|`|ZuO2R3Qiaa	well...u must frst ask her out...thn impress her and be4 its late u ask her to the dance and if u love her thn tell her at the end of the dance|`|5zw5I6xTaa	what are you waiting for just go and ask her beforee its to late|`|5pyHgpZkaa	First, ask her to the dance.

NGBP65luaa	Just think about how u got together and what brought u to together in the first place. Try and re incarnate that. Make sure u share ur feelings with him because as u to are getting married, u will go through everything together as a team. So try not to shut him out. Try to chill and stay relaxed. Maybe go away for a while to forget about all the negative thoughts so ur less stressed. This will mean you will have more patience will ur fiance and wont get so stressed out by little things. see how it goes|`|AA12051704	No matter if you're going through a lot of s*** lately, he has to know that and respect your mood swings and stay with you no matter how b****y you can be during your mood swings when s*** keeps coming along in your life. A guy who really loves his girl will try to get through everything coming along their way. It's also one test of how much he really loves you and how patient he can be with you. Just try not taking out your anger too much on him and don't ever forget to apologize for sometimes being b****y. We ladies really have our mood swings and we really tend to get emotional. But this is why we try to find our guy who knows how to respect and accept us no matter how b****y we can be. :]|`|wCjjBdzUaa	yoga|`|mDBHMJPjaa	go to the most ghetto place in your town and buy a fat blunt and get HIGH! :)|`|vRc7ktcsaa	here:<br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Special:GoogSearch?cx=partner-pub-9543332082073187%3A36zk2w-ig14&cof=FORID%3A11&ie=UTF-8&q=mood#1308" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Special:GoogSearc...</a><br>  <br>  your welcome.|`|C3KfkSsdaa	spend some time apart... then you will miss him.

I'm sure sometimes it feels like nothing makes sense, you don't even know why you feel the way you do. <br>  <br>  It's about this age that a lot of girls are becoming very self-conscious and overly sensitive of their differences compared to other girls. <br>  <br>  Just give it time. I mean, a lot of time, you'll begin to feel normal in a few years. This is puberty....|`|as8JOuZyaa	its only natural that a social butterfly - such as yourself - would undergo these changes.<br>  you help people alot, yet you don't really help yourself. take some time alone and think to yourself - don't think about others... meditate, think of things that make you humble, etc.<br>  in your saying... do you talk much? that may be the case<br>  the thing is, you feel incomplete... since you don't have a best friend, try to relate to someone closest to you - even if it means talking to an elder person - primarily your mom. get more in touch with them, tell them how you feel. maybe then you wont feel that lonliness - you just need to let your feelings flow is all....<br>  hope this can help... i wish you luck and a humble spirit|`|uIZDd3y5aa	Try to connect with a friend. Share what you're feeling with them, it will make you feel some security and comfort. But, being independent is not a bad thing either.
dd83ec34a7001b938f4187223bc6e654aa	well you need to consider the fact that there are such things as long engagements. just because he proposes doesn't mean you have to get married next week or anything. just tell him your concerns (gently and without judgement) and see what he says to that.|`|AA12051704	you can answer his question straight. tell him that you'll say yes if ever he proposes to you. and then ask him why? does he have any intentions of the two of you getting married? and when he says yes and that he has plans for the two of you to get married, tell him, you two have to get married at the right time. it's not appropriate for you to marry especially if you're still a student and he's not doing anything to find a job. if you will get married and you're the one working and not him, he'll just be living off on your money which would be totally unfair to you. you have to have equal share in everything in marriage. you can't be selfish and unfair. if he can't see that he won't be able to give you a nice future, then tell him, his dreams are hopeless. and if he really wants to have a future with you because he loves you, he has to start working for not only you, but also for himself. you both have to think about the money you two would need if ever you're going to have children. marriage is a big deal and a big step. you can't be careless about it, proposing and accepting the proposal just because you love each other. you may love each other, but there's the need of security once you've grown your own family. think of the consequences first, if ever you marry at an early age where both of you are not yet even financially stable.

mCQZrp1zaa	Is there any reason you have to make a decision right now?<br>  <br>  So often in relationships we tend to think we need to take immediate action, rather than holding off for even a short time to see what develops. You have plenty of reason to not believe this other woman, so instead of bailing right away, why not put off a decision for a week or two and see how things shake out on their own?|`|AA12346188	Then what is there to worry?<br>  Leave him to her and find another b/f<br>  Never try to scratch your skin and apply medication on somebody's problem.<br>  She may be telling this to hold him for her self, which every woman does, as all women are very much possessive and jealous.<br>  or <br>  Snatch him if you can without giving a dime to her selfish statement.<br>  As all human beings are selfish, you can just ignore her and see that this b/f of yours dies for you.<br>  this needs determination to succeed.<br>  Can you do this?|`|GmTs1BB1aa	Run|`|JjU6IdnDaa	Life is full of surprises.

However don't do anything stupid like plan to kill baby.|`|738eb3523fcda7312e683aec70d06ce8aa	Have him take a paternity test. If he's the father and he wants to take care of the kid, then I'd run. Unless you don't mind and you'd want to do that too.|`|yUiydPReaa	support him... quit being selfish!!!! this girl may have problems but he is doing the right thing regardless.. you should be proud of him that he is a stand up man!|`|QQtZKcs6aa	run till he squares all this away. then give it a go in a few months|`|FNdsPNrJaa	Well that is a difficult situation. I'd say untill the pregnacy is confirmed or proved false you should just hang in there. If shes not preggo, tell him how you feel and thats shes his EX for a reason. It should stay that way. She doesnt need him for support if there is no child. Also, just to be sure...ask the girl to provide doctors bills or the ultrasound results to make sure shes telling the truth!! Just be open and honest with your boyfriend and make sure he knows how you feel....if she is pregnant, (and you have a paternity test done) and he wants the baby. I wouldn't stay with him. Those kinds of realtionships never last, but just take things slow and make sure you trust FACTS only. If it can't be proved don't believe it!!! Good Luck!!|`|fX6ENI8Zaa	Bad, bad, bad situation!<br>  <br>  The thing is...you've been dating this guy for a month, I know you said you were serious but a month in the big scheme of things is a very short time. He obviously has very strong feelings as he asked you to stay. But I feel, and this is just my opinion of what I would do...take a step back, I'm not saying break up with him: but tell him this is a seriously difficult situation, and that you're struggling as it's hard on you although you understand it's difficult on him as well. <br>  Also another big thing, do not try and discredit the ex-girlfriend...seriously don't say you don't think its his, you think she's lying, etc. Just let him know you're there to talk when he needs you. But he just needs some support, it must be a huge shock to him. He feels like he needs to take care of his child and take care of the mother as well. But then he's also got you, which he must have strong feelings for, and doesn't want to loose.<br>  So just take a step back, and be honest and say you don't want to know all the details, you just want to know he's okay and coping. Just stay away from the girlfriend with the baby!<br>  Good luck|`|xYW7PdXwaa	Run for the hills is not a good solution. It will show that you are too weak in this situation. First of all, u must know the reason behind of this problem. It maybe sad for u coz ur boyfriend had an affair with the other girl. I would say that u must support him and his ex because it shows that u support ur boyfriend. I'm not saying that u just give up but u show that u still care about him. For the baby problem, I think u should go and talk to his ex personally. If it is true, it is fine u just need to break up. U still have the chance to find a new boyfriend coz this world is unpredictable. If u r in such a sad mood, I think u better consult a counselor. I hope u will live happy ever after..|`|qbZrYbFUaa	How are you "very serious" after only a month and a half? If he has convinced you that you are very serious after that short period of time and is having THAT kind of problem with the last girlfriend I would definitely run screaming for the hills. Somethings off there.|`|T33Za7jiaa	Bad situation.|`|pAgzvWCNaa	Just pray...and don't get to worried until you know for sure, and if it somehow doesn't turn out the way you'd like then you'll find someone new|`|ZXxIjIP9aa	RUN, SPRINT, FLY|`|6gt4sK2Paa	If you've only been with him for a month and a half do you really think you're ready to stick by him while he stands by his ex girlfriend through her pregnancy?  To each their own, do what your heart tells you.  You asked for an opinion though and if i were you i'd tell him to find out whats really going on and then call me.  In the process, run for the hills!  Too much drama.|`|sLDqymHzaa	God... wow... that's tough. I personally think you should stay... there need to be more men like him. Mean that deal with what they've done and don't walk out on their problems. Men that won't give a child a chance simply because they were too stupid to keep their pants zipped, and are too lazy to take care of the consequences. At least you know he is secure and he isn't going to abandon you when you need help. Don't abandon him. And certainly don't punish him for being a good person and a responsible "father". Not that you should have to carry the burden of a child that isn't yours, but... I feel strongly on this one. You should stay. Staying would be a proud thing to do, anyway.<br>  <br>  I definitely agree with tishalic... great idea. nice tip there.

By pursuing this situation you will get her new guy involved, which wont be good.  If she is the type of person to just take your money and leave you and get pregnant so fast from someone else, then just be thankful its not your kid in her.  If you want the money back, then take her to small claims court.  Its the cleanest wayt to deal with it.|`|nSoQaaalaa	Have you tried hitting her?|`|zrFzbDHUaa	She doesn't sound very nice.

You get the feelings in your stomach when you see them etc|`|yxRGDjs2aa	WOW!  what a question!  I think when you are young your head is still trying to understand life and feelings about people can get very confusing. You can't handle intense feelings as well as when you are grown up.  When you are young and experiencing these feelings for the first time, how can you know if it is love or infatuation?  You can't because you've never experienced it before!  All you can do is go with the flow and experience.  After a while things will settle down.  Adults on the other hand still go through the same process when they first meet somebody they like. But as adults we know to play the waiting game to see how it goes!  We know (or should do) that time will tell if it is right or not, love only comes after a while.  But again we have to go with the flow of infatuation/fancying someone a lot, to start with and see where it leads.

I've been married now for 23 years and have never been in love with him.  He was my best friend, then we got married and he stayed my best friend.  It's a good life, I love him and care for him but in love ?  No. <br>  I was ' in love' with my first husband, my second husband, and my third husband.  <br>  <br>  Lord, I was insanely in love with them and it all ended horribly and I was also insanely hurt by all of them.  Not one of those marriages lasted very long, they were intense but not stable.  Horrible and painful times for me. <br>   <br>  These past years have been wonderful, peaceful and good, not lonely.  He tells me all the time that he loves me, I'm sure he does but maybe he's not in love with me either.|`|71z3lWO3aa	I too have been hurt before, but I'm in a relationship for 2yr now and I was really scared to open up, you know, just let go off the pass.... but you have to let go off the pass in order to move forward and if that person you are with now makes you feel so special, like you are the only one that matters and shows you respect and love, girl go for it love him back....ha if it works it works and if it doesn't whatever.....live your life|`|pZxeStPpaa	well feelings is the first thing. My bf and i have so many things in common so that's how we fell in love. Also it was love at first sight..where we saw each other and made it officially the first day we met. We've been together for 2 yrs now. another thing...if ur in love with any person u will be able to feel it in ur heart. look for clues and hints..am sure u will get the msg.|`|XwMn6aY5aa	that he respects me<br>  treats me right<br>  listens to me when im not in the happiest mood<br>  tells me everytime of the day that he loves me..<br>  is willing to wait when im ready[sex]<br>  makes me laugh<br>  im more important than his friends...<br>  you'll know when he's the one i found him and im still on going|`|oCxBeEI6aa	Uhhh...If he's your boyfriend then you SHOULD be in love with him, right?<br>  <br>  So what made me fall in love with my partner?<br>  I don't have a partner. <br>  I'm 14 and what made me ever even fall in love was looks and personality. :)|`|AA10955679	feelings|`|xxQwv1nSaa	They just seemed so perfect. I haven't even seen a bad side of them, they're intelligent, they know how to make me smile even through a text message about things that aren't even funny, and they make me a better person, and that's the biggest turn on for me. If you can find the person that makes you better, you know that you love that person when you feel uplifted around them, and even though you have no problem talking to them, you can't help but get butterflies around them.|`|2ij4wwjgaa	my boyfriend and i didnt even kno the other even existed<br>  my best friend had a crush on him and wanted me 2 meet him<br>  we met and eventually my friend stopped liking him and we fell in love<br>  he moved 2 georgia and we still kept in touch<br>  im graduating high school next year and im going 2 school in GA 2 see him<br>  i knew he was the one because everything he said and did was perfect to me and he didnt even realize it and we laughed at eachother when we werent funny and i even had dreams about marrying him and i just loved him...period<br>  <br>  we were 12 when we met and its been smooth sailing 4 us since day 1 =]|`|dyhnK4eNaa	she is quit looking by heart, she as a smiling tear always, she is smart by respecting other and loving children's she had a helping nature and her friendly nature made me fall in love with her i think my choice is not wrong . i don't know she      loves me or hate me,<br>                                                               but both r in my favor,<br>                                                               if she loves me i will be in  her heart  <br>  if she hates me i will be in her mind how ever where ever and when ever i am always with her for her life long but i never tryed for a results <br>  i want to she loves me are not by her only|`|RvYqObe7aa	I guess just weird things will let you know like the first 3 months me and my gf didnt kiss well barely felt each other up,and when 34 first kissed it felt perfect and like no one was in the car with us(i know wierd place)but there was like 5 and it felt like i had never kissed anyone else,like sometimes we can talk on the phone for like 6 hrs just about how much fun we had that night,we've been dating for 1yr and 6 months but everyday it just gets better,everytime were together it just clicks like were best friend and i know we sound like were just good friends but trust me we know how to have fun,i still get butterflies when we make love after 6 months of it,like tonight i went to her house after work for like 30 mins just enough time for a quickie,we ended up have doing it and having a coversation about the wierdest thing,and i feel 100% comfortable with her and never have to buy her everything i just buy her like flowers when i think about her at work or something,<br>  <br>  Advice:just have fun with him and do what you want when you want love is fun so if your relationship feels like a trap then it prob not love
4dtUsaYhaa	i guess when you both feel your ready you will do it. but make sure to remember he is your brotheres friend and if anything ever goes wrong between you  2 , he might bag you out to your brother. ask him about whether he is ready to lose his virginty seeing as you have already lost yours before
AA12051704	I prefer making out. Because sex for me is something between a married couple. And as long as I'm not yet married, I'd only go untill making out.

If she goes down on you, then you go down on her then you have vaginal sex, then you cuddle and make out then you have vaginal sex again, it should last more than 15 minutes. there are so many positions, you need to change positions <br>   you should start with missionary (face to face, male on top), or girl superior (her on top, facing front or back). the second time you should do doggy, or you standing at the edge of the bed. the idea here is to get her off two or three times.|`|srAP6Vzvaa	if the guy knows what he is doing and the girl can TAKE IT/pounding. sex can last for hours. i had great sex last night and we went for 2 hours.<br>  <br>  anyways my choice is Sex|`|1PId0SOGaa	so you are speaking from experience|`|Lp2FNrb7aa	both! sex and then cuddling :p

Then i kicked him in the balls so he stood up and" it sounds like your making excuses for him OMG <br>  <br>  seriously Don't be scared of him!!! stop what your doing and call the COPZ|`|PtHkKEjTaa	dump his *** because no man should hit a woman he should of push you away and walk way|`|UsojaTuuaa	you deserved it.  if your gonna be a tough girl and abuse your boyfriend and act like a ***** then he has every right to hit you back. your just lucky he stopped and it didnt escalate|`|4TqadRJYaa	sound like you should be apologizing to him, even tho he did mess up too, but not really as bad as you did<br>  it sounds like this was all your fault
Wj7mBxFJaa	Go with her<br>  you like her, she likes you<br>  her second thoughts werent about making anything awkward they were about dancing itself, which you have said wont be a problem<br>  you'll have fun.<br>  <br>  You might wanna call her up or talk to her at school sometime and just bring up the dance in conversation, let her know you're still interested in it.

YK2s3YRzaa	catch her bus or pretend your walking home in her direction.|`|QeX89rP2aa	how old are you? im 14, so if you arent really close to my age, this might seem stupid. haha<br>  message her on myspace, and just ask her something about like, homework or something not really important. then when she tells you in person (because you said she doesnt answer on myspace) just ask her if she wants to hang out sometime. be very quick and dont drag it out. if she says yes, then i helped. if she says no, i have no idea what to do...lol<br>  i hope i helped!! :)|`|o7KTOHbXaa	OK study ahead... When you go to class and the teacher is talking about something raise your hand and ask a really smart question since youve read up on it... and even better if its something you researched in the library and isnt in the book... then when the teacher is talking about the subject point out blah blah blah this and that.. the teacher will prolly be impressed with your knowledge and make you look smart.  After class make sure you walk out next to her and say hey can I get your honest opinion?  Did I make myself look like a nerd back there?  Shell prolly say something like no that was great blah blah blah how did you know that?  And then you say ah yah I don't know I guess I read it somewhere.  Then say what do you think of the class?  Mr. So and so is a pretty good teacher huh?  Blah blah blah... then hold out your hand and say by the way I'm Jim (or whatever) and then shell give you her name. Say nice to meet you.  What class do you have next?  Then make some stupid small talk for a minute.  Then when you have a test coming up after class sometime you can approach her after class again and say how do you feel about the test?  Then shell prolly say shes worried about it etc... so then you say hey we ought to study for it.  Whats your number?  There you go..
f742491fb09b86c6462592b9c9819414aa	The problem that you describe is somewhat awkward to deal with - 'stupid' thou AREN'T! <br>  <br>  It becomes apparent that people vary distinctly with their delivery of thoughts, some (...thankfully) like yourself will 'draw-breath' mentally, choosing to allow the vault of thought within to focus on different topics and/or feelings. Others with similarity to your friend will 'prattle' endlessly, seemingly lacking a feature of interest to the 'must-be-listener(s)'. <br>  <br>  I don't belong to a profession in this field yet hold firm thoughts that it defines the difference in self-confidence among people - the 'over talker' is often more shy than verbal delivery indicates. Perhaps a constructive (..yet gentle) action delivered by you would be to discuss this matter with your friend in a fashion that exemplifies the TRUE value of pauses & silence - without doubt those moments are IMMEASURABLE in personal qualities.|`|trXjBRlRaa	A combination of both - a problem of hers and you are a bit over-reacting.<br>  <br>  Dead air can be more uncomfortable for some than others. It is a learned trait, as well as inherent (see what her family is like, the environment in which she was raised). It could be a problem because she needs to learn that not all dead air is "dead" or bad. <br>  <br>  As for you, you know her personality and that this is what she does. As a good friend maybe try opening up and talking with her about this instead of seething silently inside waiting for your next annoyed moment.|`|9EV86TLvaa	Don't worry about it. Often when people do that they have something on their mind which they don't want to think about so they find things g on to talk about. Try talking to her and ask if there is anything on her mind and if she wants to talk. If not don't worry about it your friend will grow out of it. Good luck and I hope this has helped.|`|O9CkqE54aa	"The best kind of friend is the one you could sit on a porch swing with, never saying a word, and walk away feeling like that was the best conversation you've ever had. "|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	some people are like that<br>  just except her for being that way|`|wy5SiCS2aa	yeah it sounds like it would be really annoying. I read somewhere a long time ago that when businesspeople in China are doing business with Americans, and it gets to the point where they are negotiating terms or price or something, a tactic that the Chinese people use is just to be silent for a minute. It makes Americans very uncomfortable, and they usually lower the price. When if they had just been quiet for a minute, the Chinese would have agreed, but all they have to do is just be silent and it drives the Americans crazy. So it's a thing in our culture, where we are uncomfortable with silences. But she sounds like she takes it a little too far.

Try telling him that you really love him and that you want him to be healthier. He probably already knows that if he stopped smoking it would be beneficial. Have you talked to a doctor.

The after you could always make her a banana split and start watching the movie...You should SHARE the dessert with her, that way you can interact with her and maybe take a strawberry from her mouth :p<br>  <br>  Anyway, just have fun, nothing to worry about, how about going for a drive after the movie or laying out side on a blanket and looking at the stars.. if you live in CALI the stars are out tonight!<br>  <br>  I wish you like! Enjoy this date, I remember when I use to do this stuff with my boyfriend... now we are married!<br>  <br>  I agree with Midnight train... the whole tickel match thing works! Thats how I fell in love with my HUSBAND!

e9431e7aacbf06accd4aa1aae5cc622baa	I met my 1st bf on tagged.com. We were together for 10months and then broke up because of long distance. It was by far the best 10 months of my life and he was and still is the best guy ever. Sometimes u can find great guys online.|`|EWPxmcp1aa	yeah..it depends. my 1st and 2nd bf i met online and i found out that my 2nd bf is good on me and really nice guy. sometimes you can meet bad guys. But need to careful when you meet them outside.|`|xDaQnLN3aa	bad|`|s5dIaL1daa	great!|`|6a1cc93dd55dba4164421281fe1a70aeaa	Doesnt matter where you meet, it's how your relationship is that matters... Do you see this guy in person now or just chatting online?  If you see him and are actually really dating, then why would it matter where you met if you are happy!  In this day and age, it doesnt matter. I met my bf at a bar and we are madly in love.
DcrI9zmkaa	MSN / Phone -- "Hey [insert girl's name], can I have your MSN and phone number so I can chat with you?"<br>  <br>  Love poem / letter -- Walk up and hand it to her or slip it in her locker.<br>  <br>  (The simplest solutions are often the most overlooked. :))|`|N5oG1jmsaa	just go up to her and say "hey i like you, can i have your number"<br>  she will either be really flattered and give you her number or she might not but you should give it a shot regardless.
iAlK1v5caa	Tell her that.Don't be afraid to tell someone who you feel.Just tell her that you are tired of her drama, and if she wants to be friends she will respect the friend code.And just be a awesome friend and stop all of the drama.Because it won't get any better.It will get worse.So talk to her, and if she gets mad then try to move on.|`|5KGiumXNaa	Ignore her. <br>  <br>  My friend did the same and a few months later started saying a load of stuff behind my back. I left her and now have an awesome best friend who I know I can get along with for a longer time. <br>  <br>  I hope the same doesn't happen to you too. I felt betrayed and while I was her friend I always felt like a pushover and that she was always controling me in some way.<br>  <br>  Anyway. Just talk to her. She should see sense and if she doesn't you be mad at her for some things and later on ask her how she feels.|`|Qbjpft5aaa	maybe she's not your friend then? i know you don't want to hear<br>  that, but its probbably true. i had a 'best friend' like that. one that<br>  put me down, and got mad for stupid reasons. i recently<br>  dumped her and our friendship and my life is so much better! <br>  <br>  maybe talk to your friend about it. if she doesn't want to cooperate<br>  then just walk away. if she comes back, give her a chance. but if<br>  she doesnt, move on with your life and hang with your other friends.<br>  <3 good luck with whatever you choose.|`|6lMRO7ISaa	Well something like that has actually happend to me. But then i just got really frustrated after a while and told her i didnt wanna be friends anymore. so now were not. but what happend with me was that shed always get pissed at me and we'd only end up beeing friends like 2 days a week. and she liked the guy i was bestfriends with etc. so i got the idea she was only hanging around me cause she wanted the guy. but now we're not friends anymore and its so much less drama for me.<br>   But if u like this person enough u can maybe tell her how u fell!!|`|4504b6d2ce4b8847c7f2d8134deb450caa	okay.. well if she gets mad for dumb stuff maybe its time for a new bestfriend..<br>  you can still be friends with her.. just not as close!!<br>  drama is pointless! but like everyone gets in it anyways... and it sucks!<br>  <br>  good luck to you friend.<br>  hope this advice helped (:|`|MM7yqP1faa	She could just be a *****, and how you deal with that is up to you.<br>  But if you truly want to keep this friend, make sure you give it some time before you make any big decisions. I actually get mad at my best friend a lot, and I try not to, b/c it's over completely ridiculous stuff! I'm kind of just irritated all the time, so it's the little things that I hold on to and blow out of proportion. Speaking from these feelings, there may be a bigger reason for her anger deep down. Jealousy, lack of self-confidence, or even a want to be an even bigger best friend to you.<br>  Manhandling her into giving you reasons and working things out in the heat of the moment may not be the best strategy. Without losing yourself, remember to be extremely understanding and try opening up to her more, and over time, maybe you can pry that lid off of HER too.|`|BhtJ1saeaa	sounds like my friends<br>  she prolly has nothing to do in her life and starts drama to get attention. same old, same old...she truly is a drama queeenn|`|eqPFKpVqaa	Sounds alot like my friendss.<br>  Well just ignore it, she either doesn't <br>  have a good life, or doesn't have one<br>  at all, or has some problems that she<br>  takes out on her social lifee... idkkk<br>  i just ignore it and it seems to be fine. :p<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqhmDy_qCwEzl4IVmXKo4Vzsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090306182327AA0D9Hi">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>
N7gOE1btaa	I think the first three adjectives explained it all:  nice, respectful, helpful.  These are great qualities.  But because of them many girls will rely on you for advice and see you as a portal into guys minds, rather than a guy they would date.  I'm sure you know girls that you feel comfortable talking with about girl stuff but would never date.  You are just that guy.  The only way to break out of this is to find the girls you like, and be the person you are, but not encourage them using you simply as a sounding board or always running to you for boy advice.  <br>  For instance, if a girl you like comes to you for advice about guys, then tell her something like, well you are a great girl and I know I'd be lucky to be with you, I hate to see you get hurt by these jerks.  This says alot--you like her, you think she deserves good things.  Try comments like that and I think it will change. <br>  One last thing, I am not sure of your age but usually as you get older, girls will want a guy like you.  Sometimes girls want more fun when they are younger, for example in their teens, and guys like us are fun but not the crazy types which girls are drawn to.  That will change in your 20s.  If you are older, then just keep giving it time.  Maybe the problem is you haven't met a girl that deserves you and your kindness!
0xGtNdveaa	woah woah take it easy. okay, umm idk if you have a religion, but even if you dont, praying to God works alot. trust me, if anyone can give you peace its God, you just have to ask him to help you. Also talk with a counselor and try to get out all the emotions you have. Seek help, i dont mean that as in you're crazy i mean it in a way that points out you have tendencies to think or dreams thoughts that are harmful for you. PRAY and ask God to help you thou=) email me if you need more advice or if you just want to talk about this. dont take it the wrong way, i just want to help.|`|0Ee8r5KRaa	see a shrink|`|wck4MHREaa	Yeah, there might be something to this dream.<br>  <br>  But the thing is...we all think/act/dream differently, and that can be interpreted differently for each person. <br>  <br>  Think of it this way; If I had a dream where I was in a zombie movie, about to get bitten, while shooting tons of undead people, I'd be in heaven, since that is awesome to me. If you were to have that dream, I'm sure you'd be terrified, since you don't want to die, especially in your dreams. Or take the image of a cloud in a dream. It might be something that is calming, warm and fluffy in my dream, and it might be a sign of "rain" or a bad omen, or "trouble ahead" in your dream. It all depends on the person.<br>  <br>  But this dream is disturbingly graphic. Either you saw a terrible horror movie a few days/weeks/minutes ago, or you are having trouble with something in your life, and you're subconsciously hiding it from your own self.<br>  <br>  Talk to someone about it (other than us Answerers). They might know better.
fccbcd3b61ed3e984f0b54f1acf4559baa	Wow, this is the exact same thing that happened to me! In my experience, it became awkward. There's the whole pretending not to know each other outside of work, mixed with the residual feelings, whatever they may be. We've managed to keep things fairly friendly and business-like, but he's never going to be just a boss to me. Plus there is an undeniable sexual attraction that makes things interesting at times. The one thing that I do have to say is that whenever he praises my work or gives me a project, I wonder in the back of my mind whether it is because of my capabilites, or my past, or both. Since I am capable, it bothers me to think it might not be because of my own merits. This might be an issue for you too.<br>  <br>  It can work but stay professional, and whatever you do, don't go telling your coworkers about your past with him!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|HXuuuLNOaa	this is no consolation, but a huge percentage of work colleagues end up having casual sex, less so ,long term relationships, and seldom partners for life.<br>  <br>  the problem is, that a boss probably spends more time with his ' secretary' ( for example ) than he ( she ) does with his wife......<br>  the only difference, one expects, is that he only sleeps with the latter !<br>  so the higher up the ladder you get, the further you may fall.<br>  he will now be under pressure too ?<br>  <br>  so yes it could be awkward..but it depends a lot on how it ended ?<br>  if badly...acrimoniously......will be tougher, is my guess.<br>  if well, just fun and ' forgotten'......maybe not to worry ?<br>  <br>  who's to say he hasn't with others; or you too ?<br>  affairs in work are prolific and almost accepted these days.<br>  but it depends on you / him / the companies ethics and expectations <br>  ( of it not happening ? ) and his morality and even handedness to you and everyone else. <br>  <br>  if he is a good guy......work as well or better than the rest. <br>  but if he's now a bad guy ( and people change when they get promoted ) you will have to 'keep your nose cleaner than anyone else '<br>  even then; maybe now.......you sould keep your eye open for other job opportunities....elsewhere in the company or outside.<br>  the reality is simple......if you sh*t on your own doorstep, one day youre gonna tread in it !!|`|c4OEuojoaa	yeaa.|`|yUiydPReaa	sounds like a hott porn movie!! good luck with that! i dont even know how to answer!|`|qTb50H7Xaa	Well it depends.  If your boss already was married at that time or you two are still in a relationship - the situation would be very awkward indeed.  Ignore the depictions and obscure scenes produced by Hollywood on love between an employee and their boss having a happy ending.  In reality, the position you are in is quite troublesome.  There is going to be a lot of hostility towards you from other co-workers and you're going to have to watch your back because most definitely "the coffee room gossip" will be about you.  However if it's just an open-ended "oh I went out with him for a while last year but there's nothing between us" then your position isn't that bad.  Just don't start telling people that you slept with your boss.  Rumors can easily make your situation hell.  <br>  <br>  Anyways besides from all of that, in terms of the situation between just you two, I suppose there might be occasionally extra attention given to you (well it depends on what type of guy he is and what he wants).  If he wants more sex again (sorry if I'm being blunt here), then he'll probably go ahead and spend lots of time with you, which would make your situation worse yet again.  Remember, work is not a dating-service, it's a place where you get paid and get out.  So my advice is, if you don't plan on having a relationship with him, then just keep your distance and if you do want to have a relationship with him, keep it outside of work.  Anyways best of luck and hope you don't run into any problems!|`|pZGVI9dPaa	It's been a year now since you had your "fling" with him so I wouldn't think that it would be awkward anymore or that he would be harder on you unless the "fling" ended  badly.|`|obNNfiDzaa	Business does not blends with pleasure that much. <br>  LOL!|`|csBvaXjiaa	If this was over a year ago, then it should not be any reason for him to be harder on you, unless you still care about him or he still cares about you.<br>  <br>  You are both adults, it happen a year ago, not a month ago.  Both of you should be professional and move on.|`|vMKEg29kaa	Ouch! You should be aware of both your career and your relationships. Anyways, Either to stand bold to your coming decision or else quit and start a new career with less mistakes possible.
erXKJQ3Baa	You shouldn't.<br>  I've had a lot of backstabbing go on in my life, it's best just to leave it.<br>  There's no point throwing fire at fire. If you confront her, she will give another lame excuse and do it again. It's best to just avoid her if she's pissing you off. <br>  If someone talks badly of you behind your back, they're not worth it.<br>  If you feel really compelled to confront her though, explain to her what she's doing rather than attacking her about it. She may not even realize she is doing it, or she could and give the lame excuse, which means, she's really not worth your time.<br>  Good luck.|`|sY1itvPkaa	Don't even look at this chick. Shes psycho and you need to stay the hell away from her.|`|ERRbGENmaa	The best thing to do is ignore her.  There's a lot of girls like this.  It makes them feel good to put other people down, usually because they have no life and they want attention.  Anybody who listens to her deserves what they get.  <br>  <br>  Worse is anybody who is acting as her messenger.  Either they're trying to cause more trouble or want to put you down by relaying the information.  I'd find other people to hang with if that's the case. <br>  <br>  People like this don't matter.  Feel sorry for any guy she gets.  He'll be living the hell that she is.
c4ded2672a1b6461a7cf5ac2f327a09faa	Yes girls do listen to others. We listen to others mostly because we don't want people to say anything bad about ourselves. Us girls need others approval to feel good about ourselves, especially at a young age. It would take a very self confident person not to listen to others. My advice to you is change your reputation in school. It may take a while but your rep is in your hands. As for the girl you like, send her a smile and some kind words every once and awhile. Then step it up and maybe send her some candy in her locker, anonymously (girls love that). Good luck!|`|sY1itvPkaa	It sucks cause a lot of girls tend to listen to their friends and if her friends are telling her that guy is weird and stuff like that she'll listen. They like to get other peoples opinions.
aDhZIhQcaa	Truly being "in love" entails:  Communication, trust, loyalty, laughter, unconditional love, total forgiveness, being able to say your sorry, but the most important things are to emotionally connect, spiritually connect, soulfully connect, and have sexual chemistry that takes your breath away.  After 49 yrs on this earth, I finally found my soulmate.  I arrogantly thought that I knew everything about love, boy, was I wrong.  And now that I met my soulmate, the man that God created just for me, I realize that I had always settled before him.  What I have with my man is so powerful it overwhelms me sometimes.|`|PvAIY7OPaa	19th century: Macho men and pretty women were the fantasy that was fed into us through books and bit of emotions thrown in between. <br>  21 century: Money is calling the shots.|`|1uRUaSblaa	True love is selfless, sacrificial.<br>  You put the happiness of the other <br>  above yours.You love the person not <br>  because he earns it but because<br>  his well-being means that much to you.<br>  This is unconditional love,another aspect <br>  of true love.It goes far beyond superficial <br>  lovey-dovey feelings.|`|KZlgdMeEaa	in my opinion true love is when u accept the other for who they are flaws and all

Dude I think it is time to move on.|`|oiX4LOCpaa	I know I am not getting best answer for this, but am willing to lose the points based on this question.<br>  <br>  Are you smoking pot? Your rambling suggests so. Why are you so attracted to a girl that won't talk to you if she is with her friend and is probably smoking pot? <br>  <br>  Why would she want to be with someone that calls her 'a kinda asshole?'<br>  <br>  Either you deserve each other or neither of you has any idea of what a good relationship entails. <br>  <br>  It makes me sad, and disturbed, that guys like you exist and young women like her are attracted to you.<br>  <br>  You have little to offer and hope you can reel her in before she recognizes who you really are.<br>  <br>  Step up and become who you are meant to be.

0tT9BYm4aa	The best thing to do when trying to get over a boy is to actually make the effort.<br>  <br>  You have to want to get over it, and not just THINK you want to get over it.  It takes time, and a lot of personal growth, and self-confidence.<br>  It's one of those things that will NEVER become easy... but you can do things to make it go more smoothly.  <br>  <br>  No matter how much you want to think about him, and how sad you are that it wont work, DO NOT.  You must force yourself to go do a lot of other things, focus on some school projects or something... truly enjoy life outside of thinking about this boy.<br>  <br>  It sounds like this was your first experience with something like this.  Please try and take it as a learning experience... sometimes "love" hurts.  And please don't think of him as your "first love"... you had a crush.  In time, you will grow to truly understand the difference between love, and having a crush, and I know just what you're thinking right now "but she doesn't know how ______ he is." or "how much I like him", how much I think about him", etc...  Yes I do.  this is coming from someone who has never been in a relationship before...  I thinkt hat you have to truly grow in a relationship with someone... and I don't mean holding hands in the quad or something... i mean a true relationship, in order to call someone your first "love".<br>  <br>  Sorry... soapbox moment.<br>  <br>  Anyway... good luck with this.  It's difficult, it truly is, but try as  hard as you can to not take things like this personally, and to truly enjoy life outside of boys.  Value yourself as YOU, not as you with someone else.|`|kZtws4IZaa	Try to get a new crush,<br>  And if you still cant get rid of thinking about him, think of the gross, or not so gr8 things of him.|`|RKs8wa9yaa	WOWWW I AM NOT GONNA READ ALL THAT...

Matinee Idols have always been the crush of girls and envy of guys.  The perceived distance between the object of affection and personal private sensitivity is a secure comfort zone.

The guy has no clue or feelings about what you are enjoying from thoughts of him.<br>  <br>  The only intimate contact is with your self.  Who better to manage the personal and private education on sensual imagination and growth.  Controlling the place, time, and intensity of gratification is an awesome responsibility.<br>  <br>  You are on the correct path.  Academic, athletic, and extra curricular excellence will consume the priortitiy time of your career and educational growth.  Social life is secondary.|`|AA11294940	Easy its called not be a stalker|`|0xGtNdveaa	the way i see it, you never know until you try. I know it doesnt seem like the best thing to do, but honestly you cant say he wont be yours until you've actually tried. so take a risk, talk to him, who gives a crap what others will think. You have nothing to lose and the worst he can say is no. Just try your luck and see what happens. dont cry, believe me, im a guy and im telling you no guy is worth crying about, unless you're married. There will always be other guys out there, it just takes time and the willingness to go search. Good luck and take care=D no more tears, smile BIG=D!!!|`|ZkhYMswFaa	Why did you doubt yourself in the first place?<br>  <br>  You should try to become friends with him and see if he is a nice guy or a jerk. maybe in the future things might work out between you.<br>  <br>  You never know until you try|`|f80f4fccfa6cfbf5720b905152d8cc81aa	Someone told me once before, that the only way to forget a person like in your situation, is to treat as though the person doesn't exist. Totally shut him off your thoughts and memories. Its difficult, but if u can mentally fend off thoughts of him, perhaps the pain would be a lot less. <br>  They say time heals everything, but well, sometimes it doesn't. Best thing is to try to forget as much of him as possible and move on.|`|wck4MHREaa	Wow, you must be the cutest thing ever, I swear!<br>  <br>  Um...keep yourself busy. Forever! Not forever, but yeah, do stuff to keep yourself busy. Find a new hobby, talk to/hang out with friends, meet new people (guys!), all that fun stuff. You can cry or whatever for a little bit longer if you want, but you'll need to move on sometime, because you'll miss out on the awesome opportunities that life has to offer. And you don't want that to happen, because an awesome guy is out there for you, and you won't want to miss out on that.
F2rI3Juaaa	Nothing! You sound perfect!|`|mBXu5G5saa	hey go easy on the skinny huh?, nothing is wrong with you, you chose to be that way, nobody told you to do it, nor were you born that way, so appreciate it and get a guy that is going to like you for who you are!|`|iW80AcLgaa	I don't like skinny girls, i like junk in the trunk, and curves|`|2kR4sX48aa	i prefer average size girls.<br>  but i do also like petite and/or thick girls too.|`|AA11294940	its in all who you hang with, i got friends who are married to larger women, its a personal taste, hang around with skinny people and thats what you get|`|g5JqqtrIaa	I don't know, but I would really love to know.|`|n6QFyflgaa	Skinny? i prefer slender.  not too skinny, a body of cecilia cheung will be perfect.|`|UKbb4GgTaa	Societal norms and expectations.|`|xACBQs52aa	hmm it seems the problem is internal, not external.

w7aHSXCIaa	It's obvious that she likes you! Just by what you said, I can tell! When a girl moves and tries that hard to stay in touch with you, that's a dead giveaway that she likes you! The fact that she is comfortable enough to tease you in a way that would be rude to anyone else is also another important sign.|`|AA10787626	I think she does like you. Continue talking to her and flirting, it will definitely lead somewhere. :D<br>  Good luck!

2eztcCO0aa	Maybe they're asking you that because you never tell them that you think they're smart, funny, etc.  No woman wants to think that you're just with them because they look hot or because you want sex.<br>  <br>  And yes, if you don't wise up and let your girlfriend (never just call them females!) know that you appreciate her for qualities other than her looks or her willingness to have sex, they will look for someone who will.|`|2mlHf7Opaa	Very low self-esteem.

Just like guys.|`|gyNadSFpaa	yeah... its weird. i do the same... its a sign of insecurity, try making em feel great about themselves =)|`|13d4bd226d0dce7fe19e7693dc8cfed9aa	because thet are stupid|`|pQw80POJaa	Probably because they want to know why you're with them. I wouldn't necessarily say it's a sign of them looking elsewhere. She might just be fishing for compliments. Let her know you love her and that she's special to you and hopefully she'll not ask questions like this that most guys think are asinine. Although, some girls are insecure and will continue asking these questions no matter what you do.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|t4ebT9araa	because they want you to tell them you care about them.<br>  or that they're beautiful<br>  or sweet<br>  or talented<br>  whatever.|`|AA10787626	Because they want to hear beautiful things from you and want to feel good and assured and loved.|`|AA11480344	They want a compliment because they might not be self-confident.|`|X4Owk0xTaa	They need reassurance of their worth because they are insecure, low self-esteem or just want their ego to be fed.|`|ZXxIjIP9aa	not really, we just really want to know how u feel about us r where this stands. we r just really emotional creatures, b patient with us|`|pbTN9xYlaa	we really want to test you to see if you really care and love us|`|6aQi4sHeaa	No were not looking somewhere else. Its could be different for some girls, like girls that ask it all the time just wanna feel special and loved and such. But I only asked it once at the start of my relationship to know exactly why he feel for me and its good to know cause if they give you a serious answer then you know their serious about you.|`|0dgXwRNMaa	I have never in my life asked a guy that.  You must have found some incredibly insecure girls.  Maybe you should look for somebody that has a self-esteem, it's a lot easier to be happy with someone that knows they have worth.|`|X7rFKgUyaa	Girls want you to tell them how much you care & to just compliment them sometimes.  they wanna feel loved =)
37M3dkkRaa	maybe solid snake looks like a limp dick? you never know. from what i hear, those never turn ppl on. and just say its over b*tch. and thats how you break up with him.
h99Mcg6taa	Go out and mingle.  Don't try to meet people on here.  Go to singles events or something.   Plenty of online dating services too, but those girls want something serious and not someone that's still hung up on someone else.  I'm glad you're taking the steps to finally move on, it's best for you to do so.  It's still a little fresh for me and it's easier said than done, I know, but 7 months is a long time for you to not be ebjoying life and sharing it w/ someone that treats you the way you deserve.  You seem like a great guy that has heart, my ex clearly doesn't, so you should have no problem finding someone special.  Before you know it, you'll forget all about this girl.  Good luck and let me know how it works out =)|`|DkZfaIUVaa	Oh my God! You are 31? Grow up buddy!  Maybe that is your problem.  Real men don't need "moral support."|`|Z4B93N31aa	go to match.com

I'm not ambitious.|`|kxMDFPnbaa	a guy with a HUGE dick|`|BA3y6MBlaa	Dream guy you say?  Cool, I'm up for the fantansy...<br>  <br>  First..of course physical chemistry is important...I happen to be a sort of hottie, but i've lived long enough to know that people you would never imagine connect do connect...because of confidence is in places other than their fugures.  If you are counting on your figure versus any other qualities do not sign a pre-nup.  Yuck...why am I going there?<br>  <br>  Point is as your dream guy, you can take him to your firends and family and he connects.  You take him to a work party and you don't have to babysit him.  He takes you to a function of his and you can hang and make friends on your own.  No babysitting or jealousy issues to muck up the evenings.  I'm speaking of mostly urbanish professional environments.  But if your country life requires two incomes, you'll need a secure man who knows that talking to your boss at a party or in a scenario is not making a loving connection but making a professional connection..  <br>  <br>  Dream man:  Say you invest tens of thousands in a partnership with others and everyone has their tasks...make sure he does his...if you knock yourself out to make it successful as do your partners and he's the weak link and you lose everything...that's a bummer.<br>  <br>  Make sure you have a performer, a leader.  Drugs or substance issues for a nice girl is like poisen.  We want to fix and heal and years go by and they still aren't fixed and bills pile up. <br>  <br>  Dream man:<br>  <br>  Secure, talented, solid family, ok looking, nice reputation, appreciations you, similar likes and dislikes, can handle each others friends and family.  Put each other first in your lives and you can't go wrong.  If you strart to feel abused (or onsided in the work scenario), commuicate and it's heard and remidied.<br>  <br>  All the best.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also critical is how he treats his siblings.  If they don't have siblings, your only resource of information is Moms & Grandmoms, etc.  He's sassy and disrespectual, this is his inherent behavior, he can't help but fall back to these if you are not perfect.  And who is perfect, you have your own issues.|`|lIGq4RJlaa	He is my best friend, sometimes lover, substitute for an older brother. <br>  <br>  He's remodel floor guy, not pie in the sky guy. But he's also doesn't lie guy.<br>  <br>  He can cook, and joke. He's not a pig in a poke, and he doesn't smoke (unless he's on fire).<br>  <br>  He can do laundry and wax the car, <br>  and be lots of fun in our boat or a bar. <br>  <br>  He's still got hair, and he really does care. But, he's not too square, he doesn't swear (well almost never), and I can count on him to do his share.|`|zrFzbDHUaa	I'm married to my dream guy.  He is good looking, smart, funny, works hard, compliments me and appreciates all I do for him. He is my best friend and I fell comfortable telling him anything.

Thanks for your question, it was nice being able to express this about my man.|`|kToZcmOgaa	well my dream guy would be cute(not every guy is fireman hot) funny, and all round package like you said respectful, sweet, romantic,taller than me AND NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE A MUSTACHE, and even better creative and energetic and EXTREMELY well in bed =)|`|VvMquavyaa	Gordon Freeman.<br>  Facial hair?

I want to be the blonde in the relationship)<br>  <br>  Personality: (in no specific order)<br>  - Funny (I love funny guys - whether it is comedic funny or dorky funny...)<br>  - Sweet <br>  - Gentlemen<br>  - Can be silly and random (too serious scares me)<br>  - Knows how to have fun<br>  - Honest<br>  - Devoted<br>  - Respect me<br>  - Loyal<br>  <br>  That's the so-called "dream guy" But of course, I like many guys who doesn't fit any of those qualities at all....lol!|`|af5283ef1b057dd3a086032b98ac13c2aa	my ideal guy is at least 5'11,  caramel skin,  clean shaven or no facial hair - shoot not hairy period (i dont like chest hair)  dresses nice, takes care of himself and his possessions, likes to read, can be thug, but loves to be sophisticated!  classy, but aggressive..  i would say, a blend of Obama, T.I., Jay-Z and Dr Christian Troy.

t2TMqjeQaa	YEP!!!
Za3iJC3paa	Oh yes! ABSOLUTELY happier. Do not be scared. As long as you're financially sound enough to make it you will be fine. Yes, bills suck and sometimes work sucks but having complete and total freedom is one of the biggest reliefs in life! It is also followed by a grip of resposibility but I know personally, I never went back nor did I ever think of it! I made a promise to myself that I would never go back to live with my parents even though I love them dearly! I like being on my own! You're in for a ride! I think you should do it!|`|UrOP7C9Waa	it depends on where you're going to be living. if your moving into your own place, it's so much fun getting to decorate and getting to do whatever you want, whenever you want. it's more challenging considering the bills but if you're financially stable its perfect! I LOVE IT!|`|90u71DQ2aa	depends on your situation.  Being away from home can be fun but you need to ask yourself if it is really going to solve the problem?|`|Lp2FNrb7aa	If you cant take things at home then of course you will probably be happier moving out. but it will take a while to get used to things, to doing everything yourself. but the freedom is fantastic!|`|tADSxyqwaa	its hard. i left home at 18 and although i struggled it was the best thing i ever could have done.<br>  some tips - <br>  1) make sure you know how much work running your own home is.  from housework to cooking to laundry. i never realised how much my mum did for me til i did it all for myself.<br>  2) check up on running costs and make sure you can afford everything you need, plus food and occasional going out money - thats rent, water rates, council tax, tv licence, phone bills, etc.  Food always costs more than you think so try shopping for yourself for a couple of weeks while you live with your parents - gives you some margin for error<br>  3) make sure your parents know you arent leaving because of them, you're just trying to assert your independance.  even if you feel as though you cant live with them for one more minute, when you do goo your realtionship will improve.  every minute you spend with them after that will be a chosen minute and will be more quality time.  i had to move back after a car accident when i was 21 and my relationship with my mum was so good by then we lived together for a full 6 months without any major incidents.<br>  <br>  good luck
Ih6Bgggsaa	i dont think that you fall in and out of love easily i think that you get bored easily. the tip to a long lasting relationship are:<br>  <br>  - find someone who compliments you... they must have a lot of similarities but also alot of differences. it is proven that people in relationships who have partners that have alot of similarities and differences ranging from fashion, to music, to food, have longer relationships, because there partner introduces them to a new world, and after a while they have a dependency on the other person becsue they have a dependency on this new life.<br>  <br>  -make sure that you spend equal time with each other as you do with your own friends, giving each other space is important, because it helps them see that you arent smothering you but that they still care about you.<br>  <br>  -dont be afrad to do something new, sharing a new experiacne is another way to keep together. you'll enoy the excitement and you'll love the other person more because of the things youve experianced together. i sugest bungee jumping, its expensive but worth it, and the adrenilin you get from it works well for a night of hot and steamy... well you get the picture...<br>  <br>  dont go for your typical guy... broaden your horizens, date someone of a different nationallity and a different age... you'll find someone oneday.<br>  i hope this helped.|`|gJ20jfK5aa	well there possibly could be many reasons to the 'why' you've put up...1. you might have not given much attention from your father side to you when you were young.<br>  2. it could be in you nature (straight forward or blunt)<br>  3.you might be an attention seeker<br>  4. you are a hasty person<br>  all of the above mentioned things need practice if you fall in any catagory. beside that we all have some serious issues in relationships no matter what, so dont get depressed that easily cos you are not the only one sweety! just avoid this unstability in relationship that will help you in future.|`|obNNfiDzaa	dear little one, maybe because you don't know what falling in-love really means.<br>  Maybe you're too occupied with the attention of the person presently involve to you. <br>  Try to mingle with other people, spread your horizon and don't jump easily "in" on a relationship.<br>  That is something that you have to be devoted to.|`|kadNaNg9aa	i dont think that u fall in and out of love but the idea of being in love don't worry  when the right one comes along u will know it|`|AA11958489	I don't think you are easily falling in and out of love. That's just a fallacy. Relationship is mutual and needs to be nurtured. If both of you are attracted to each other, you both will decide to see each other more and more, whereby you will understand the other person better and the bond of love would establish. Take your time in first gauging the next boy you meet, before you "fall" in love with him! Good luck.|`|ZyT49TY0aa	if you go into a relationship expecting them to F**k up..it wont last<br>  <br>  If you have high expectations..it wont last<br>  <br>  If you're too picky..it wont last<br>  <br>  If you're too jealous or manipulative..it wont last<br>  <br>  If the guy is not meeting your standards...it wont last<br>  <br>  If you're standards are too high....it wont last<br>  <br>  If you are with someone and you keep thinking in the back of your head that you can do better........it wont last<br>  <br>  If your previous relationships last less than 6 months, and all the guys are the same, and you date a guy who's the same style as them...it wont last<br>  <br>  If you're the one breaking up with them, then there is something that you're just not satisfied with. Don't feel bad. it's normal. The right guy will make you fall and stay in love. it's cliche to think this way, but it's true..just don't have unrealistic expectations. =)|`|n0rJH0l6aa	Find someone who you like everything about and become close friends first. If you're friends then it's easier to forgive and let the little things go because you know what a nice person they are.<br>  <br>  That's my tip. I've only been in one relationship and we've been together a year and a half. I know that's not very long compared to some relationships, but we've had no problems at all.
V9VJIw1Uaa	hey.. dont go for grammatical details..<br>  pour your heart and your love to him when you are kissing him, that will be more sensuous than following some theoretical instructions.|`|cWuumdy7aa	Great Breath - This is very important. Make sure you brush your teeth before going out on your date. There is nothing worse than kissing someone with bad breath.    <br>  <br>    If your date consists of having something to eat before the actual kiss, make sure you have a mint on hand to take right after you finish eating. Don't take the mint just before the kiss or chew on gum. You don't want to have something in your mouth when you kiss.<br>  <br>  Moist Lips - You want your lips to be slightly moist when you kiss. Run your tongue over your lips once before you kiss. Don't wear lip gloss because that tends to make the kiss too gooey.<br>    And don't wear a lot of lipstick unless you want your partner to wear it too after the kiss. Slightly moist lips makes it easier to move your lips over your partner's and gives both you and your partner a more pleasant experience.<br>  <br>        Positioning - Stand close to your partner. As the two of you move closer together tilt your head slightly. If you can see which way your partner's head is tilting, tilt your head slightly in the opposite direction.<br>     Close Eyes - Just before your lips meet, close your eyes. Some people prefer to leave their eyes open during the kiss. But until you know what your partner prefers, it is best to close your eyes.   <br>    Open Lips - Open your mouth slightly and place your lips over your partner's lips. Do not hold your breath! Breath through your nose. As your lips meet, press them gently over your partner's. You may wish to move your lips in a slow, circular motion or just leave them still over your partners.<br>  Closed Lips - This is like the type of kiss you'd give your grandma or aunt. Instead of opening your mouth when your lips meet, keep them closed. This is also a good way of letting your partner know this is as far as it goes. It also makes a great hello/good-bye kiss or a great first time kiss if you're nervous.|`|bN6S0FJEaa	Watch this<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HErs1opBcRM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HErs1opBc...</a>
lxrKf7bRaa	yes he likes you. its obvious. IF he told his little sister those things, it is only because he did not want to give an honest answer to his sister. he seems shy and scared, of course he isn't going to tell anymore. but the body language signals he is sending you are telling you what you already know. if you like him, next time u catch him looking at you, smile at him, then look him up and down as if you are assessing him. your smiling and looking him up and down will encourage him to come out of his shell. trust me on this, i know. i've used those two tricks, among many, dozens of times. works like a charm!|`|ibeFIUpkaa	What's your Question?|`|x1FzJLwZaa	he probably likes you and him saying you are gay or weird is just his way of letting you notice him|`|kd3ufKBDaa	it sounds like he likes u but is too shy to either ask u out or admit to ppl that he likes u, maybe if u like him u should take the initiative and start talking to him.... not telling u wat to do just some guys have problems asking girls out (to shy) and i can tell u all of this from personal experience..... hmm u arent talking about me are u? lol jk i know u arent

How do you know he isn't telling other girls to send him pics ? Find another guy, u were doing great for 3 months..block him on everything. Trust me
X2bxkU2paa	YOU didn't do sh*t wrong.  You're fiance's brother is 100% at fault for this and you did the right thing telling your fiance about it.  The brother you're not with is obviously very jealous of the one you are.  He's a peice of sh*t, and part of the family or not, your fiance is better off with out him.  The jealous brother is 100% to blame; he created the "wedge" you're referering to, and you all are actually better off with this "wedge" keeping the jealous bastard out of your family's lives.  Don't feel bad!  You did the right thing.|`|1iXvphNYaa	You didn't drive a wedge between anyone. This is the brother's dealing. Look after yourself and your child. Easier said than done, but at the end of the day, you're mom, as far as the kids know, the world's best. Peace. :)|`|3rrZU8Ioaa	It isn't your fault, Your fiance needed to know about his brother, especially if he makes u feel uncomfortable with his advances towards you. I am sure that your fiance and his brother will be fine soon.. blood is thicker than water!<br>  <br>  hoope i helped!?|`|z6rCAG2Taa	You didn't really do anything wrong you told the truth. And you shouldn't be shamed. Your fiance's brother should be ashamed. he has no right saying that stuff. Don't fret.|`|ox7OUUUoaa	wow.<br>  his brother's a jerk.<br>  its okay. dont feel awful<br>  hes a mean person
pxNnXwwBaa	0ok. dont try to act "cool" cause girls hate that. be yourself. umm... are you friends with her cause that makes it better. it takes time. but dont take to much time. try to comfort her during her bad times. rhen eventually she will consider you as more than just a friend|`|HMJDLIVFaa	get a job. get money. buy a evo. then pick up some h 0's|`|E58cSdOQaa	Life is short, just ask her.|`|kjqGTk2Maa	hi<br>  <br>  so how was your day...|`|w1BpSd2xaa	face to face.
w1BpSd2xaa	no; its over-rated.|`|m8LXKlQiaa	nope!!|`|aXOyK3uBaa	Yes you're missing out.<br>  <br>  I only go out with girls for Sex. I can decide if I like her AFTER we spend more time together.<br>  <br>  And how much I like her isn't up to ME anyway --->> ITS UP TO HER!<br>  <br>  If I wait around for girls I actually LIKE, <br>  I would not have sex NEARY often enough.<br>  <br>  That woud be a shame.<br>  <br>  Besides....  its a GOOD thing that guys don't need to "like" the women we  have sex with.  Because some reay bitchy girls wouldn't get any sex either!!<br>  <br>  So it works out great.<br>  <br>  Cheers.|`|kd3ufKBDaa	no u arent u just gotta wait for the special guy to come along..... for some reason i have been having this saying go through my head all night and i think it kinda goes along with this... in the end it is always the person who shows up when u need them the most without u even havong to ask them too|`|zqjkkNOfaa	They must think im crazy too then.|`|5SiBOTGXaa	go out when and with whom you want....  do not EVER let other people bend your willpower or change your values...|`|PPwOv2bKaa	It might sound weird but I'm the same way. I haven't had many girlfriends because I don't go out with just anybody (eg: only cus they're 'hot'). I think it's fine not to jump into relationships so quickly, it shows you want something more serious. I actually asked a girl out recently and she told me she wants to see how things go, get to know me more and not rush things. I took it as she wants to know if I'm the right person she's looking for and can get along with. I say it's fine to take time to find that special person on the inside and out :)|`|VqWBGWAoaa	I say start with inside or outside and work forward from there. <br>  <br>  You're not missing out. Find what you like and go with it. It's your reality.
u9GQRbhvaa	Ya that's weird...she just likes to talk a lot, and attention..|`|csBvaXjiaa	Oh yea...that's weird.  Maybe that's the only way she can express herself is through blogging.  <br>  <br>  Ask for her cell number or ask if you can meet her somewhere because you would like to talk to her without blogging and see what she says.|`|PvaxJHLuaa	everytime, she's just gonna get weirded out, so like 2 or 3 blog replies like every 2 weeks or once a month. dont be overbearing dude, seriously it kills relationships like guns.|`|x1FzJLwZaa	she just wants lots of comments in her blogs just for popularity reasons <br>  <br>  lame.|`|xxQwv1nSaa	Yeah, give it a rest, cause then it seems like you're too eager, or worse, a stalker.|`|YNOySbxFaa	If she wants to talk. talk to her [: girls love being talked to.|`|AMqfcWw2aa	well if ya like the girl i think it would b right to reply...|`|L7GH0SjAaa	Not wierd.<br>  Maybe she'll finally get the hint!|`|DlT1oQJRaa	no, let the girl know you like her (;|`|5zw5I6xTaa	no if she likes you and you like her then go for it
lVNYRSs8aa	you like her<br>  <br>  go for her and make us proud dude|`|OB8KPPIQaa	well no i mean I (in my opinion) dont think its love i think its just a really really big crush... i know how you feel there are people that make you feel this way and ya sometimes it hurts but the only way to get over it is a) get i over the person (which is easier said than done i know) or b) do things that will make you think of something else
7AFLaiYjaa	well that happened to me. I started liking this one guy last year, and me and him would always make fun of each other, but then suddenly i started liking him and thinking he was cute out of nowhere.
dZGL4NU8aa	Whether or not he is good-looking or not, if I'm not interested, I say, "I'm not interested."<br>  <br>  If I don't know who he is, and he is good-looking and he comes up to me I'll tell him that.<br>  <br>  When I say that, I actually meant that in all angle - look/personality as an overall. <br>  <br>  yeah, even though he's attractive and a great communicator, if he's a random stranger in a bar or something like that, I'll still be not interested.<br>  <br>  I'll be interested when I finally know who he is and then decided that I like him.|`|OeGcRJ6Xaa	Yeah. it could have to do with looks. its not that the person isn't attractive- maybe they just dont find that person physically appealing. some people have different types and such. <br>  on the other hand if it's not based on looks...<br>  im gonna say it could <br>  1) be his personality- bad personality = no go.<br>  or 2) she just got out of a complicated relationship or messy break up and she sincerely want time alone.|`|A7SmQQF3aa	I say it when it seems they are desperate and trying too hard or very unattractive. You wanted me to be honest.
xACBQs52aa	pay her.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	Yellow pages under escorts. That's the only quick way|`|fvN18yvGaa	get rid of the attidude of getting a gf in one day...|`|r2AdkMuraa	you can you just have to wait its impossible to get one because you probably wont like her and not know her that much there is a 1% chance you could idk you might get lucky
mCQZrp1zaa	If you're both of the age of legal consent in your state/country, it's totally your business and nobody else's. I'm currently dating someone where we have over 20 years in age gap. Thankfully I look nowhere near my real age, which helps keep the funny looks to a minimum!<br>  <br>  The age spread will probably make for some challenges that might not otherwise be there, just because of differing life experience and maturity, however even people born on the same day will have some of that. Bottom line, if it works for you both, then it's all good.|`|FNdsPNrJaa	I think its fine. I wouldn't date someone that much older than me though because I know they will die before me :/ Much Much Much before me. However, having said that, date for a long while. LONG while. having such an age difference leaves you open to change a lot. You are both and critical ages and you dont want to make a comitment thats going to make you regret it in a few years!! <3 Good Luck!!|`|QeX89rP2aa	it seems a little creepy to me. im 14, though, and i guess the idea of dating someone that much older than me creeps me out. (unless its david cook. dammit, thats illegal)|`|mQg5SVQXaa	Well, if you quit with that "baby face" b.s. you might stand a chance.|`|Njgof6hNaa	I think it's ok to have a relationship with someone that much older, but you shouldn't make any long-term decisions. People change with age. A lot of your major changes happen through your 20's. You're still changing a lot. Give this time and try not to get married of have this guy's children. Take things slow.|`|3FkMjHqlaa	Age doesnt mean anything if you are both really in love then that is all that matters.  Love knows nothing about age just be sure he is in it for the same reasons as you and as long as your both happy that is all that matters who cares what anyone else has to say about it.|`|SpCihawgaa	im sry but i realy think 19 and 30 there is something wrong<br>  <br>  now my mom and dad are 17 years different but they met later in life say 25 and 42<br>  <br>  u will not get the chance to see your fun years|`|0RbhykJiaa	No, I wouldn't.<br>  <br>  But, If you feel in your heart, go ahead and do what you want.|`|M7r7gHNGaa	My uncle was more than 20 years older than my aunt and they were very much in love. You're both of the age of legal consent so don't let 11 years bother you.|`|vMKEg29kaa	Tell you what; Age to me is nothing. What gaps any age difference is the mature understanding and care.<br>  <br>  Some people are said to be old but they act like immature and completely irresponsible folks. Its better off to quit judging people in such respect. <br>  <br>  Since love and understanding are mutual aspects between you both then discard everything else.
vepFdMYDaa	I think you put too much pressure on him<br>  <br>  He likes you. He respect you. He likes you and respects you enough that he wanted to get to know you and more slowly from a friend side to intimate side and develop a RELATIONSHIP with you. <br>  <br>  But instead, you want Mr. Happy now; you didn't think about protection or are you on birth control?<br>  <br>  He manages to stop being a guy for a second, and gets a condom - SMART MOVE.<br>  <br>  The stopping of sex then getting a condom, and the pressure you put on him, and him wanting to wait, can play a big roll on not making MR. Happy to work right.<br>  <br>  Then you biaotch text him later with, "Can't talk to anyone, @sshole!" who would want to talk to that attitude?<br>  <br>  Maybe if you were a little bit nicer and sympathetic and not thinking of YOU and start thing of both of you together you could have a better situation.<br>  <br>  Be nice, and not so selfish and maybe you too will go farther.<br>  <br>  FYI: Captain Oveur's Sex Tip #23<br>  If a guy hasn't has sex in a long time or in frequency, he can blow the thing more quickly. The solution is frequent sex. He has to get used to how you feel and learn control when he is inside you.|`|1QSsOAAFaa	It is VERY unlikely he lied to you from the way your story goes. 99% of all penises work for maybe 3 minutes maximum. I'd say 60% of men can't go for much longer than half a minute. I mean, that's just really normal. Especially if he's inexperienced and/or "rusty".<br>  He's also embarrassed (which makes sense) but does not need to be. You don't have to be completely frank, but if he won't communicate, you might have to just be direct and invite him over again.<br>  A little tip, get the condom on before penetration. It's safer and the experience won't be sabotaged by a similar interruption.|`|CoVpcCKWaa	I think the whole experience probably freaked him out. Maybe he really didn't mean for things to get to that point, and now it's really ackward for him to approach you. He is probably confused, and a little embarrassed (because he probably did ***). You need to see him, and you both need to talk about what happened, and then go from there.|`|BW08FTWPaa	maybe he isn't talking because he embarrassed himself and doesn't want for you to look him. trust me when a guy embarrasses himself he really doesn't wanna be seen by  anyone but eventually we get over it|`|86d9b2b62dcc28930dc4afb30d86ff38aa	You need to talk to him face to face.<br>  No Phone<br>  No Text<br>  No E-mail<br>  No electronics what-so-ever.<br>  <br>  I realize im younger than you, but what he's doing just seems stupid.
ti1K0USpaa	I think what you're feeling is totally normal.  Have a straight-up and honest conversation about what you're feeling with him - explain that you're nervous, but in a good way.  Guys like to know they're making a girl feel "butterflies" and that they can make their girl's heart pound - it makes us feel like we're appreciated and, in a weird sort of way, admired because we have that ability.  Don't try to choose your words too carefully - just tell it like it is.  If the guy has his head on straight, then he'll appreciate the honesty, respect you for bringing it up, and you'll be telling him what a guy likes to hear from his girl.|`|6a1cc93dd55dba4164421281fe1a70aeaa	This is normal and part of the excitement of being in a new romance. This nervous feeling is what they call butterflies in your stomach... OOhh I love that feeling! YES it is normal. That happened to me, we are madly in love now and he is the father of my little baby...|`|eEGUatbfaa	yeah its normal<br>  just chill down. act yourself <br>  dont make it awkward for him too|`|WAl3vvNnaa	I liked my best friend for two years, but at the time he had a girlfriend, she ended up breaking it off with him, and over the summer we became even closer. In the fall he ended up asking me out. Even though we knew each other for two years I was still extremely nervous on the first couple of dates we went to. So it is normal. You are used to just being friends with him so the dating thing is completely new, to both of you, it will get easier trust me. Next time try taking a couple of deep breaths and relax. It will get easier. I am sure he is as nervous as you are. Good luck I hope everything goes well.
Qzhb7zYEaa	Let me give you the low down on these creatures we call women.<br>  <br>  At young ages, girls are into the more rude/jerks/broke *** losers because they seem a bit more confident since they're just talking **** all the time and they also appear to be more masculine..<br>  <br>  <br>  then when they **** up and end up being a single mother and 24 years old, they want THE NICE GUYS that did good in school and have a stable job so they can have a decent life.<br>  <br>  but because men like that don't want to deal with that quandary, we don't take interest in them. THEN women get mad that all the "good" men are taken like its our fault.<br>  <br>  <br>  call me a sexist, i don't care. i just gave you my opinion based off observations I've seen around me through family and friends.|`|L7GH0SjAaa	You sound kinda like an ***.<br>  Bu that's ok. Keep at it. You have the rest of your life to find the right girl. <br>  <br>  Are you looking for a relationship? Ask yourself if thats really what you want to get into. Maybe you should focus on just finding an amazing best girl friend.<br>  Think about it.|`|f9440ee6f423d4970bad3c1e64047e3faa	You have to make some moves to get them..you're a man dude..u do the first move.coz maybe they think your too far for them...you need to go down if you feel that confident!
IPS3hWweaa	Just remember that you're the one in control, don't ever let anyone pressure you into doing anything that is uncomfortable with you.<br>  <br>  He's almost at the age (18) that would make it illegal for him to do anything sexual with you. You could remind him of that.<br>  <br>  Or, if he tries something, you could just tell him to stop and tell him that you don't like him like that but still like him as a friend.|`|obNNfiDzaa	If you really don't want to do it, then there is no way that he can force you to do so.<br>  That is why we have the word no. To impose that we don't want it.
TqeJ5CTPaa	If he is a good friend, then you can just tell him, and he would understand. It's better to talk to him about it then to spend your time living in regret, and thinking about how your life would be different if you took the time to ask him. He is your friend for a reason. He is your friend because he excepts you. You never know, he may like you back and be waiting for you to do something about it. You will never ever know unless you try. I wish you the best of luck and really do hope that it will work out for you guys.|`|wck4MHREaa	You just tell him, " I like you as more than a friend". That's all.<br>  <br>  I would think that you should make sure that he likes you back before you do that, just because if he doesn't feel the same way, then you guys are going to be in a very awkward position that you can't really avoid. <br>  <br>  If you feel like you must tell him, regardless of how he feels, then just do so in a calm, succinct way. Even if he doesn't like you in that way, if he cares about you, he'll still want to be your friend. And that, at least, is something that you can look forward to in case things go awry.|`|FLeHvtcAaa	That's a common question that is always tough if you are a mindful person.  <br>  <br>  I'd say try and get a feel about how he thinks of you, first.  See how he reacts to you being a little more intimate.  Every once in a while see where his eyes go when he looks at you.  <br>  <br>  Whatever you do, don't come on too strong and don't corner him or make him feel like he has an ultimatum.  Don't want to risk losing your friendship, right?|`|YK2s3YRzaa	next time you guys are having a laugh, look into his eyes for an extra second. If he looks away immediately and cringes or soemthing, thats obviously a bad sign. if he looks back, smiles or whatever, then he probs likes you back.<br>  <br>  after you know he likes you, just tell him youre starting to like him as more than a friend|`|TEE4sJscaa	Tell him when both of you are alone. That way there is less pressure put on the two of you and there is more of a chance that the truth will come out.
Lfc9Zav2aa	You need to let her go. She has a relationship with someone she loves. hard as it is take the bullet and wish her well.|`|ke1SgRxTaa	Move with her.  Show her how much your friendship really matters and how much you care. Then you can be with her when she would have been alone. And she's still with her boyfriend. It's a win-win-win situation.
oOSNI3wbaa	from that list, only hayden is in my top 5.<br>  <br>  jolie is WAAAAAYYYYYY overrated.|`|mCoipTkbaa	no
p5cZqYcVaa	I would go anyway,  I myself regret not going to mine!  I also have several friends that regret it as well!   Its a milestone thing that you should do... Regardless of not having a date go anyway you might get to hook up with someone who feels the same as you!!!
N7gOE1btaa	There are two things here.  1) your boyfriend needs to stand up for you.  Yes, that is his brother and he shouldn't let a girl get in between.  But by disrespecting you, your bf's brother is also disrespecting him.  2)  I am not placing any blame on you, some people are just assholes, but maybe you need to continue to be the bigger person.  This comment may not apply to you because maybe you have really tried, I don't know.  <br>  So are you stupid to be with him? Well do you think you are?  Do you feel like you deserve better?  If your boyfriend is in his 20s and wont stand up for you, then he will never do so and in my opinion thats a risky relationship.  But I think you need to really bring it up with him firmly that you deserve better, don't like it, and he needs to tell his brother to stop.  If he can't follow any of those, then sadly it may be time to move on.|`|NuaXMa5waa	sweety,sweety,no!<br>  you stay with him. just cuz his brother isnt happy doesnt mean anything,if your only 22 i would make him wait a bit. u still have a lot to live for..<br>  and if ui do get married, picture it, youll barealy even have to see his brother. <br>  <br>  good luck ):|`|5SiBOTGXaa	I have to say yes!<br>  <br>  if you even have to ask, then yes...<br>  <br>  if he does not stick up for you and and defend you in front of his family then he is a low status male, a weakling <br>  <br>  you have only be with him for 6 months, and he does not have the skill to create the passion that would leave you with no doubt he is the man for you..   <br>  <br>  its your 1st love....  you are young, use it as a learning experience...
PlRYgRcoaa	Just calm down a bit, focus on other things in life, maybe school and having a succesful future|`|tpioRQHkaa	picture him as your grandpa. but in speedos. haha|`|yUiydPReaa	calm down killa!! aaahh. first infactuation, and trust me it's infactuation. this is where self-control comes in. find some activity to do to keep your mind off it. change his name in your contact list to dont text or call. it will do wonders, because he will be the one who will be wondering and he might wanna actually start dating then. just have that self control not to text or call him. oh and learn this now while ur young if someone dont text you or call, dont feel abandoned. ur needy get a puppy lol! dont worry im the same way!
ULkqriEhaa	I certainly would hope not! you shouldn't have sex with someone who doesn't love and respect you no matter what. <br>  <br>  If a guy would be irritated or upset with you for crying during sex, then he's not worth giving your virginity to!|`|M7r7gHNGaa	That would depend on the cause of the pain. She might cry because she is unsure if she is doing the right thing by having sex, she could have pain because of fear (causing her to tighten up), pain because there wasn't sufficient foreplay for her to be well-lubricated.  <br>  <br>  None of these reasons is actually acceptable because they could have been prevented by proper knowledge, trust in the guy, and his consideration for her. Very few girls have a complete hymen by the time of their first sexual experience because it can be partially, or completely, torn by doing sports, riding bikes or horses, and use of tampons. If the guy gets annoyed or irritated he's a jerk who needs to have more respect and consideration for the girl.|`|xfpJGBfwaa	A guy who loves you will be concerned about you and try to make you feel better.  He will be understanding and kind.   Only a jerk would be upset or irritated about that.|`|j6jmzHSvaa	I didn't cry on my first time, but I don't think my bf would have had a problem with it!|`|nkrK268haa	i would actually feel sorry coz im hurting her... why the hell would it irritate me?|`|IUxM3brbaa	guy will not care, just enjoy|`|AA12051704	well to me, a guy should not get mad or irritated when he's having sex with the girl and the girl cries during her first time. it's normal for a girl to cry during her first time and if the guy would get mad or irritated at her for crying during her first time of sex, then he doesn't really love her -_-  because a guy who loves his girl, accepts everything about her. and the guy would most likely be more careful in making love to his girl, especially if she's still a virgin. and he would try to go slower at first. because no man would want to hurt his girl during her first time of sex. PLUS. at least, he's having a good time, having sex with the girl. he should be a little grateful that she's giving her virginity away to him -_-|`|PQeFXAr8aa	Hello Dear,<br>  If it was really that painful would it be talked about all day every day, Sure it hurts a slight bit, but think of it as the cost of admissions, unless you marry the first person you sleep with and never separate, I promise that the emotional hurt will be far worse when you and the first guy separate, Just think In a few short years you can be a college girl gone wild on spring break, that's the real fun, not the awkward high school stuff.<br>  <br>  But seriously, your going to cry after, just try not to cry during|`|RvYqObe7aa	Um if the guy gets upset tell him to take it out and leave cause hes not the right guy,my first time and my gf she cried and i just told her that everything was going to be ok and held her tighter|`|n6QFyflgaa	different men have different feelings for different things, same for women. well, my answer is going to be "it doesnt really matter for me."|`|0gadGln8aa	It would definatley be a mood killer would not be annoying though
A9cMmbueaa	wht is this She's all that 2? if u watched the movie making bets on a girl is never a way to win her heart......psh|`|Wj7mBxFJaa	making a bet on getting a woman is terrible.<br>  you're gonna lose, sorry, but that's what happens when you're an *** to her and yell at her, especially when she's trying to help you.  sounds like you dont like her too much.<br>  my best advice is to just ask her before the other guy.  if she really is a "nerd" who "does not have boyfriends" maybe she'll just be excited someone asked her, even someone as insensitive as you|`|ThqPi5lxaa	By the sound of it, the girl can do better than you and your friend!! Does it matter is shes a 'nerd' if you like her?!? The only way you can really win a girls heart is by NOT betting on winning them over...they will find out. AND not by bribing their friends, girls talk!! Be nice to her, DOOONNNTT bet on her!!!!! <br>  <br>  Seriously, at this rate it doesnt sound like any girl will go out with you, sorry!|`|9Z5Qdsw5aa	wow, 1st of all sounds like the plot to not another teen movie, 2nd off i dont think she would want to be the subject of a race to her and money, kind of is insulting on her part because it makes her seem like an object id assume, also bribing her friends is sounds like prostitution without the sex|`|ge5x9NHxaa	This is not an ideal thing to do.  But however if you walk up to her try to engage her on conversation, then gradual apologies to her and express your feeling.  You never know from this your betting it might turn to real relationship.|`|IXCAJdBiaa	go rent shes all that watch and learn...|`|DTxQ2Tpvaa	if you love her, or like her tell her you want to be honest tell her that you want to be honest with her and want to be with her. if yes then you can mention the bet after you kiss her. Kill her face but not her lips or mouth because that's too intimate for the first kiss. But if she doesn't take interest in you still after you tell her, then tell her about the bet to begin with as a proposition to trick your friends to "earn" their money by putting on a good show! either way you win the money! And in both cases buy her something nice even if you win her love to begin with and if not, you will win her love if you buy her a really nice watch and or a good book.|`|5PO7gDGRaa	aha <br>  sorry but unless your nice to her over a period of time shes not likely to forgive you in a hurry unless your super good looking and she cant do any better.<br>  I think offering moneys a really bad idea, then your implying that shes a whore. <br>  how much moneys the bet?<br>  Don't try to be incredibly nice cause she will think its a joke and your making fun of her, smile in the corridors and generally be nice to her and her group.<br>  Let it be known that you like her, even if its embarrassing for you. <br>  Over and out.|`|9FlUlbYXaa	Guys like you are why young guys have the bad reputation and the high auto insurance rates they do.  I hope you don't have any daughters before you're 40.  Payback is something else.|`|PcRyxJ07aa	This is awful. Betting on girls? how could your friends! You should loose, because if you win and she finds out, she'll think it was all fake. Girls want a boy that actually like them.|`|yUiydPReaa	how bout try this. stop watching "she's all that" and betting on females like it's lottery. you will hurt her feelings ya anus|`|kadNaNg9aa	i think that what you are trying to do is mean|`|fwrfIxIaaa	bribe her friends? you obviously know the way to a womans heart|`|7ZWk1SDNaa	yes, you do it... if your love is true then god will help you & you will success to win her heart... best of luck...|`|UCX1JfFTaa	i hope you loose. thats terrible!
5OEijjFVaa	Take her out for dinner then go let her buy anything that she wants and then give her a homemade b-day card... Homemade is the best|`|mRgRDhMQaa	you should buy her some really pretty smelling perfume or body spray, jewelry (necklace or bracelet) and a card and write something sweet in it.|`|FpaTR6skaa	If you have the money buy her a night on the town... take her where ever she wants and buy her whatever she wants... and then take her to dinner and to a movie.

But, try and use some rogain, or some Dr.Merical products, they work to. And for what ever reason your hair isn't ready by the wedding, you can always go to the salon and they can put a weave piece in to cover it.
RbYEif0Waa	ohhhh ive wonderd this too :D|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	No, it's not wrong, but it's not likely that anything will come of it.|`|trXjBRlRaa	It is not wrong. Nothing may ever come of it, but it is not wrong. Truth be told it happens more than most people will admit to because they are embarrassed or just don't want to lose a good thing.|`|HJpHYpGbaa	It's not wrong and It won't be the last time! Guy's can have "girl" friends but if ever given the chance, he won't think twice.   That's what guys do!|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	as long as you keep the thoughts to yourself
tL5PAazuaa	**** the qualities of the boys girl! Go for the one you LOVE. <br>  <br>  But if i were to answer your question, i would say the quiter one. Because then you can transform him into a playful person with the power of love :) Also, dating a musician is also great, they have sensitive feelings as they portray emotions through music sometimes :)|`|8K3IucU3aa	if you can't even pick out your own guy why should you even have one?|`|PpYl2dFVaa	b cause mesn mature slower then women so always a couple years older|`|jX8qRYUDaa	b he seems nicer
0KXiwjDbaa	Please don’t be embarrassed about being shy or inexperienced.  <br>  <br>  My first question is how experienced is your boyfriend?  If he is shy too he will probably be very patient and understanding.  Things will progress naturally as you both become more comfortable.  If he is experienced he should be smart enough to know that you need to take things really slow.  Either way, you shouldn’t worry unless he is a jerk and is only interested in sex.  If that’s the case you are better off without him anyway.<br>  <br>  Don’t know if you have ever had your heart broken before, but first time relationships are notorious for being the worst heart break ever.  You will experience emotions and feelings that you didn’t know existed and will have no frame of reference on how to process them.  It’s like graduating college and getting your first job.  You think you know what you are supposed to do, but you don’t really have any idea what is expected of you.<br>  <br>  If you want to find out what is on the other side of the bridge on your own, please stop reading now.  Personally, I would want someone to tell me how to avoid a traffic jam so here goes.  Don’t expect this relationship to be your last.  You are going to say and do dumb things.  You are going to speak up when you should have shut up and you are going to be silent when you should have said exactly what was on your mind.  You are going to make mistakes because you just don’t know.  It is pointless to kick yourself about it - - just accept this fact and try to enjoy yourself as much as possible.  <br>  <br>  Concentrate on being a good friend first.  It takes more than liking movies, pizza, and making out to build a relationship.  There has to be something that you both are extremely passionate about.  For example, does he have a weight set in his apartment and really likes to work out?  You could tell him that you’ve always wanted to get in better shape but never had anyone to work out with.  Now you have a reason to see him everyday and get sweaty together.  You see what I mean, but your interest has to be sincere; you can’t just pretend you are interested because you think it is something he likes to do.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.  Feel free to email me if you wanna chat more.
t2R3mEMoaa	First you are not 100% sure he hooked up with any one else and until you are you are playing the old game of  jealousy. This has killed more relationships than anything I know of, including financial problems. I found out a very long time ago that we can lose many friends and significant others if we stay on board this ship. Check in with yourself as to why you feel this way. It usually stems from our own insecurity. Until you have sound proof and I don't mean gossip or rumours, don't give up so easily on him. On the other side of the coin, I don't think he would be as arrogant as that, to invite old girlfriends or a present one to an open birthday party, would he? Does he come off as some kind of an Adonis with the ladies? If so then maybe, just maybe you are better off without him. There is lots of fish in the sea my dear. Better to know now then 5 years and 3 kids later!|`|HJpHYpGbaa	You can't make someone love you back.  Either be patient and let him do what he has to do or move on.|`|dUogQFrbaa	Sounds like you need to sit down and talk to the boy! Tell him how you feel and what you would like to have happen. BUT... before you do that, you need to make sure that you are prepared to deal with however he responds. You obviously cannot continue on like you have been. Even if he says he does not want to be in a relationship right now, you can at least begin to move on. Hope you get the response you are hoping for!
Z3DsL9Bqaa	if im being honest i don't think she's interested and that she is just a flirtatious person. it sounds asif she flirts to make her ex want her more. just be patient tho i may be wrong, just play it cool for abit and then when your not so flirty she will miss you and come running back!<br>  <br>  good luck :-)<br>  <br>  x|`|zJTBAeuOaa	move on. it seems like she's just playing games. or maybe she just loves you as a friend. change your facebook back to single and see what she says. if she says nothing shes just a friend. maybe you read too much into it. take her word for it if she said shes not ready then she's not ready. but don't wait around either. you guys are best friends so keep that relationship. but if you find you like someone else as more than a friend see where that goes.|`|3jqcLj7Saa	well your not in love with everyone else. be concerned with her feelings and be yourself. If she falls for you then you know its for real. If not remember it was not to be.|`|wLeZNlqjaa	move on then.

t2R3mEMoaa	This is quite a dilemma and I have no easy answer. I think it would be for the best if they took one year off and away from each other. If after this one year they still feel the way they do now about each other, then I would have to say go for it. When 2 people marry it is for them, not for their families and if they are still 100% sure they want to spend the rest of their lives together then they should marry.  No matter how wonderful and giving our parents are, they have no right to choose who we marry once we have become of age to do so and to think otherwise is very controlling and just plain wrong. I would be careful though, I have heard some very cruel things about what can happen, should they defy their parents and their religion. However, I know how strong love can be even in the face of adversity. Good luck and God Bless|`|36PrVK7Oaa	He should stay with her. They both should be clear about their plans and be persistent and have courage telling their parents what they want to do. They should give their parents more time to adjust to the situation. If the daughter is going to provide grandchildren to the parents they may be more accepting of her making her own adult decisions.|`|5yFnjp56aa	'You can not do love, you fell in love' is a common saying. If this is in England, there are number of other stories and lessons can be learned from them. Problems come when someone else appears in their life later on. In life we change our thinking many times. I suggest they should wait other two years before making a final decision.|`|VlzlPAEwaa	Tell her this is her life, not her parents..she is old enough to make her own decisions|`|jbG4IQW3aa	My wife & I were in a similar situation. Her parents didn't want her to marry me. In fact, as soon as she graduated high school, they took her to another state to keep us apart. We had dated for 4 years at this point, and knew we wanted to get married, so to us, this was just a minor set back. I secretly traveled to where she was and "rescued" her, and we got married on the way home. We've been happily married for 26 years now. At first her parents wouldn't speak to either of us, but after about 6 months, they finally came around. <br>      I realize in the muslim world, some marriages are still "arranged". But marriage is intended to make the participants happy; not the parents. The man & woman has to live with each other, not the parents. My advice is if they are truly in love, they should marry. I don't regret a minute I've spent with my wife, and they wont either if they're in love.<br>  <br>  Hubb
cMyPQ90vaa	well if they were my parents and i was of age (18 years old) i would pack my things and move far away i would not deal with that it's like all of you are in prison I'm a mom of 2 and my son is only 11 and i let him go to his friends and sleep out i would never do that to my kids i mean i put my foot down when i have to but i would never get mad if they were playing one thing and decided to play another sorry to say but your parents have you all in their own prison and like i said i would move as far as you can even if they don't like it just go and if you all have kids don't ever do that to them because you all don't like to be treated like that it just makes you not wanna be near your parents..... but good luck|`|CSWNU2REaa	TOTALLY IRRATIONAL|`|0lwVzAxPaa	It does sound like they are a really strict, but I think they're doing that for your good. They're probably just scared that something bad might happen to you. Your parents are just looking out for you, they want you to be safe.
f5f2cbaa7f2dc242e7b6f95e3a1514daaa	Stop showing up online, it's the only way if you don't want to tell her what you have done. She wont find out it was you this way and no ridiculing for you! You don't have to stop showing up online all together if you care any for how that might affect her, you could just go online less and less, say you're busy and not able to come on much anymore. Eventually however, she may find out through your guy friend if you tell him about all this and he opens up to her. Oh, and I realize you say that your guy friend *was* really into her, is he still in to her? If he is you could try and hint to him her feelings, if you haven't already told him about what you've been doing. <br>  =] <br>  Sticky situation...don't stay stuck! Do something.|`|PpYl2dFVaa	tell her the truth about what you did its flattering|`|uP9M7Kzuaa	i think it would be best to tell her and make sure she knows you just wanted to know how she felt. tell her you feel SUPER SUPER bad and that it was just to know how she felt and that you wont tell anyone and the you promise.
KySLpGZGaa	Awww sorry that's just so sweet. Don't worry most people start to love their best friends, because those are the people who are always there for you and know you more than anyone else in the world. If he isn't gay then I'm really sorry to say that it might not work out the way you want it to. I would give you advice to talk to him but there is a chance that you might wreck your friendship and make things awkward. Have you tried dating other guys? What you can do is check and see if he reacts when your dating other guys.<br>  Good luck :)|`|PYmdmuw8aa	Is he gay?|`|V3o5o6XRaa	Maybe you should start dating someone else then you could forget about your friend so you can stay friends without things getting awkward.|`|o1AJmAFPaa	depending on his sexuality,<br>  you two could talk it over and decide to date, but if it gets weird or awkward, to fall back into friendship <br>  <br>  like ted and emmet on queer as folk,<br>  best friends&lovers <br>  :)
JJARLh3zaa	go to her house for a serious talk. be gentle with her and don't force anything out of her if she doesn't want to talk.<br>  <br>  my best friend was male, and i loved him the same way you love her. that kind of friendship between a guy and a girl is something worth keeping<br>  <br>  ^_^
gc13i3Qqaa	one thing you can do is hug him, start to kiss on his neck, then while telling him that you love him, and how much joy he brings to you,than raise his shirt, then start to kiss on his chest working your way around his nipples, then girl it's on, you start sucking on his nipples like you would want him to suck on yours, don't give up read the vibes you will know where to go from there, only if the mood is right, go for it. c617p@yahoo.com|`|Yo7CNsq8aa	start rubbing & touchingg & when you really want to get in to it start squeeezing him tighter & tighter around his hips start breathing heavily hell totally get the message .)|`|p6hIgKWTaa	run your fingers through his hair, then slowly start to put your self on top of him but not all your weight hold yourself up allitle
IPS3hWweaa	Here's a truth about guys when they drink. They usually don't lie. Alcohol becomes a wonderful truth serum and when a guy gets flat out baked, he becomes incapable of telling a lie.<br>  <br>  Take what he told you as the truth unless you find out otherwise. But find out from someone else, don't rely on him to tell you what's going on when he's sober.|`|3irrWRUWaa	the real truth comes out when people get silly drunk.|`|XkPgw7ZRaa	This whole texting thing is getting out of hand.  When you send out a message, do you realize that you are putting your message out in the world and you are accountable to the greater public what you said.<br>  <br>  There is no control or accountability for what people say anymore.<br>  <br>  Anthony|`|gRXy66dOaa	just tell him to let you sleep and that you'll talk to him the nest day|`|xtd2h5JTaa	I always end up sending a stupid text to a lady when drunk.<br>  <br>  Good question......atleast now I know its not just me hahaha|`|5Lw7feUkaa	someone else sent that message!|`|cR3nGvWiaa	probably one of his guy friends tricked him into getting drunk and sent you that txt message to mess with your brain dont worry bout it thou its very unlikely he'll get that drunk again|`|2mRL1Cw9aa	I think that you have already answered your own question. Whatever his reasons were, they are not in your best interest. I would say walk away...and fast!<br>  Good luck.|`|pAVoCiIkaa	thats not good because usually when your drunk...they tend to tell the truth. so ask him if he was drunk at 1am|`|e0dcce03a5934d3ac052cba2ba76fbb1aa	Because you are both open enough and are talking to each other <br>  don't assume anything.  Asking the question would be your best option.  Your dating which means that you both do talk with each other.  Communicate what you are feeling.  Ask. <br>  Ask him directly.<br>  <br>  If you and he are forming a relationship the best way to communicate with each other is as directly as possible.<br>  <br>  What can it hurt.  you are talking and you are going out with him.<br>  Someone else may have been using his phone to text you.<br>  Think about it, then do what comes naturally.<br>  Dream  Wishes you good luck|`|zRI33zu2aa	You need to talk to him. First of all I beleive it's called drunk dialing or in your case texting and it is common for people to say stupid things they otherwise wouldn't in the middle of the night when they are drunk.  However like the other's said, alcohol lessens a man's inhibitions and he usually becomes more honest.  He could have just been talking out of character because he behaves and speaks differently when he's drunk.  Maybe he was just trying to create a loophole because he did something with his ex while he was drunk and didn't want you to be shocked if you found out.  But..... I have been on the other end of a female trying to start trouble by getting hold of a man's phone, so that is definitely a possibility.  Girls can be manipulative when they have a purpose.  I would just put it out there to your boyfriend and find out what he meant.  If his explanation doesn't add up or make sense then you need to decide if you can trust him or not.
acWyJ3t0aa	You really have no age problem and if you like him and your parents approve , then that is all you need . Don't worry about what other people say or if they like him or not , you aren't going to be going out with any of them and if they are your friends then they will understand and if not , Oh well .|`|A0JmmwNdaa	Well I like someone and the case is kind of like yours. Though he is only a couple weeks older than I am and his sister doesn't know. I guess I try to impress him and I talk to him around other people, but never really alone. I think that the relationship could work out, but try talking to your friend about it and telling her that everything would be the same dadadadadada. Something like that anyways. Talk to your mom or dad or another one of your friends...that's what I do and it works. Good Luck.|`|hprR6qfHaa	You do not sound in love.  Grow up a bit and think hard about the question you posed here today.<br>  <br>  For the time being though, tell your friend that you like him, then tell him.  That way you will know, for sure, whether or not you are risking your friendship when you tell him your true feelings.  This is always the best/only way to resolve such situations.  Good luck.|`|8I0oORxYaa	well age is just a simple number, and no 1 can judge you through love. You have feelings for this dude and think that no one can get in the way. if u dont get him fast, someone else will get him.<br>  go!<br>  xoxo<br>  amira|`|uHwYB921aa	so what <br>  dnt care bout wat ova ppl think! <br>  <br>  you are who u are ! <br>  <br>  date him ! <br>  age matter aint an issue !! <br>  go 4 it =) <br>  <br>  x|`|XkPgw7ZRaa	Dear Jacki<br>  <br>  Love hurts, love is unkind.  Can you give it more time. They will all come around.<br>  <br>  Anthony|`|F4G2jExiaa	i don't think those are problems, if he asks you out; say yes! who cares what your friend thinks, she'll get over it.
f8ON3dRfaa	Personally, I feel that she couldn't get over you and have to do all these blocking stuff to show herself, that she's making the effort to get over you and the good moments you shared together. <br>  <br>  Nothing about you or what you've done, but she's working on her end when she made up her mind to move on.<br>  <br>  If you need to do something, just leave her alone would be the best. I'm sure she will appreciate it too.|`|498JdszFaa	Hmm story too long to read. First reply: I wouldn't touch those links on my PC.
498JdszFaa	I'm sorry but I think you're a "rebound" GF, he probably can't stand being single. <br>  To me it sounds like he is still emotionally/sexually attached to this secretary girl and far from over it. You can't make people love you whose feelings are still with someone else. On top of that he seems immature when it comes to relations. I would dump him till he has it all sorted out. I bet he will come up with a new "rebound"  before you know it.|`|0TEvBSQyaa	I think at the moment his head is definatly Messed up. So i'd let him sit and think before you go into sex, because it could remind him of this woman.<br>  I think all you have to do is be confident and be yourself! Thats the best you can do, and dirty talk, tell him that hes amazing and mean it! tell him what you think of his body. and so on.<br>  <br>  Just if he does not want to, respect him decision! He sound messed up and need to 'rest'!|`|q4yJZ6a8aa	he may have just been not in the mood! men do get like that sometimes...and maybe if he thought he didnt u would be upset. just dont think nothing of it - if it keeps happening then worry!!!|`|N7sxTppuaa	try some role playing and dress with a theme|`|7e9bce7df6b13d448cd20f1bff3d3cf3aa	He sounds like he has a lot a guilt issues to resolve. If these issues are due based on guilty feelings involving sex, the act of it will trigger the association again.<br>  <br>  Also, you may not want to hear this but, how do you know he hasn't cheated on you? Is it possible? He acted strange when you wanted to get close to him and I know that is a sign that some men have cheated.<br>  <br>  Do you really want to be involved with someone who has so many issues around cheating?|`|u8MOrhnvaa	I think this guy have wayyy to many baggages. He feels guilty about a lot of things, his failed marriage, his failed relationship with the woman that he cheated with. as far as you , he feels embarrassed by the way he expressed himself to you the night he was drunk. Listen, don't feel like you have to do everything and anything to make him feel whole and secure again. Nice encouraging words would be fine. Tell him you appreciate what he had told you the other night and tell him that you'll leave him alone to get himself together. This guy needs a shrink not a gf. Don't be his shrink or he'll just drag you down too and make you feel like krap and needy like him.|`|f9hHqA1Vaa	yeaaa ;)
uyX6VP2Yaa	how old are you?<br>  um.. well if u really like her tell her how you feel! <br>  if she feels the same there should be no problem.|`|0oF6yFmPaa	Never ask for a kiss, just kiss, and if you kisses back, it's ok.

And I'm not talking about a fireworks moment but a true "Oh my god she's beautiful moment" <br>  <br>  Here's how I know.<br>  <br>  I went to my ex-girlfriends baby shower and my girlfriend was there. Later I pulled her aside and just kissed her with all the love I could ((We'd been dating for 5 months and it was a long distance relationship)) and my exes brother dropped what he was holding.<br>  <br>  End point? Your always going to remember your first kiss with her. And so don't stress or over plan. When the moments right, you'll know.|`|Jsvvm4qsaa	Just kiss her.

Adults can’t play with toys without getting laughed at no matter how badly they may want to.  There are so many other things that kids do that adults wish they can do but can’t.  I know kissing looks like it might be fun and I’m sure one day you will be a really good kisser, but there are so many other really important things you need to learn first.  <br>  <br>  For example, do you even know how to talk to a girl?  Don’t you think you might want to learn how to talk to girls before you try kissing one?  Find an adult that you trust like your Father, Mother, Aunt, Uncle or school counselor and talk to her about what you are feeling.  Don’t be afraid to say whatever is on your mind and you’ll feel a whole lot better.  :)|`|eth48m7Iaa	you need to talk to your parents. they will understand and they will know what to do. your to young to be worrying about girls anyway. it will happen when the time is right.|`|xVk5o4Luaa	ewww idk about the first part... umm talk to your doctor<br>  but about yhe kissing part simple, just do what feels rite
KkTJf8kWaa	You will always be two years older but that's not really the point.<br>  If he's using these kind of excuses now, then he could be using you.<br>  Once he has his career, he will have more money and he might believe that he can have any woman he wants.<br>  No more excuses!<br>  Good Luck.|`|e640e5fc04f1c4da3326c5429e707bdcaa	He is telling you he is not serious about your relationship and it will not lead to marriage. If you have any respect and value yourself, you might want to consider the easiest way to dump him. Through this you can work on your self esteem and review what you deserve and dream of in a relationship...start with love, honor and respect. I am sure that you will find this within and find a partner that reflects these qualities. He obviously can't. p.s. two years older is nothing, really.|`|QP8LdPLeaa	i believe hes a very smart guy, people usually marry without even preparing their life first. he is VERY smart. if youre in some kind of rush, then let him go.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  *edit*<br>  its really annoying when you have a bunch of girls siding with a girl when the subject is always on marriage. why get married when you havent accomplished the important things first? why do women pressure men as if there is some rush or deadline? the guy wants to finish his career, why is that SOOOO much to ask? at least he can properly take care of his wife with a freaken good job instead of having to TRY and pay the bills, pay for baby hospital bills, paying for college and house rent all at the same time. people are just so stupid these days, you always want to do things the hard way instead of just being patient and wait. so now this guy is a jerk for not wanting to marry you. thats how he feels!!!! he can't help that.|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	He cannot marry you due to you are two years older. Well this is never going to change. You need to make a decision if you are looking for a relationship to blossom into marriage. Move on; he has already told you it is not going to happen.<br>  <br>  If the reason for him not wanting to commit to marriage with you is due to him working on his career and obtaining his educational and career goals. Then simply wait if you think this is the man you wish to spend the rest of your life with and there is a chance. His desire to have a career and goals in place before marriage is very wise. <br>  <br>  Your question is very confusing. First you say due to age he will not marry you. Then you say due to career he is not ready to marry. So which is it?|`|VbrvE128aa	This is something yu will really have to sit and think about...One thing youn knw for sure is that you will aways be 2 years older...Thats never going to change...I feel as if yu guys are not really in love yet...You may be but obvisously he isnt...I dont say dump him because you already know that that is an option.,,I say leave for a while and dont answer phone calls and see wht he does. You dont know what you got until it gone...If he knows what it feels like not to hve you then when he gets you back he isnt going to want to lose you again|`|v0596BTeaa	If he thinks he cannot marry someone 2 years older than him, or he thinks he cannot have a wife and a career, then he is an idiot.  Dump him.|`|YE0baNYRaa	dump him|`|XT81GCu1aa	I think we need more info, such as how long you have been going out with him, etc., and how old you are.  I think my opinion is a little different from some other posters but here is something else to consider.  If by "make his career" you mean he wants to wait for a year or so to earn enough money to support getting married, it might be okay.  Especially if you are both very young (ie just out of high school.)  I suggest asking him straight up if he intends to marry you, if he says no then he probably means it (guys don't lie about this) and you should move on!  If he says yes, then ask him how long.  If it's years into the future, you should move on.  If it's a reasonable time and he gives a good reason, you might want to hang in there a little longer (say a year or so.)|`|IRikuHx4aa	O_o; It doesn't matter who you are, any guy that doesn't want to marry you because they want to make a career is stupid.. He can still make his career even when he is married. Sounds as if he loves his career more than his significant other. If that's not what you're looking for in a guy, then go ahead and dump him.|`|y87aZjXzaa	love someone who will love you and marry you whoever you are..his priority is his career obviously to your statement|`|6EFEUoJgaa	he SHOULD get a career before he marries you
IRikuHx4aa	No, hon, this happens everyday to a lot of people throughout the world. Things were just meant to happen. He probably just found out who he truly loved, and was tired of being treated like crap from his ex. Seriously, you're not a boyfriend stealer, nor a bad person. It happens. :D Don't let that get you down. Just be happy with your life, and try not to treat him the same way as his other girlfriend did. I'm sure things will be wonderful for you both.|`|VOMRvvkcaa	well i dont think that make's you a bad person!!:)<br>  like u had said your boyfriend had some problems with that girl so in every moment they can just broke up n that is what happened!<br>  n you are not a boy friend stealer because when u hand out with him he didn't have his girlfriend!! :D|`|GCpFF2mRaa	Would it be alright if a girl started talking with this guy and hanging out for three hours a day and calling each other at night now that you two are together?|`|5fIBXX7gaa	as long as you guys are not friends then your find but if you are yea that's kind of selfish|`|mwW4zIwIaa	No! Not at all.<br>  He dumped him personality wise, so I'm sure it's not your fault. The only thing you did to him was being a nice friend and listening to his problems!<br>  <br>  Don't feel sorry for the ex 'cause she was the one being mean to him. She was the one giving him problems.<br>  <br>  I think a boyfriend stealer would be someone who actually snatched a boyfriend from a person. But in this case, you wouldn't call it so.|`|e640e5fc04f1c4da3326c5429e707bdcaa	of course not. However what is happening here is a case of "I can't possibly deserve to be this happy...something will probably happen to end this." shakiness. Otherwise known as fear.<br>  At your age, 99.9% of relationships do end simply because you both are evolving and becoming through hormones, character etc. and eventually you will need to move forward. Hopefully that is far in the future and right now you need to stay in the moment and release the fear. Fear lives in thinking backwards in regret, and guilt, and it lives in the future, looking forward in anticipation of the worst. Both are non-reality and are based on negative fears and pain sourced cycles of worry and anxiety. <br>  Right now, you can quickly pull yourself from this cycle into one of creative life-giving positiveness. Stay in the moment. Replenish your self-esteem constantly by giving to yourself in little ways. This is not a material giving {although that is nice too} it is a self-love, self-respect, self-value deep care that can begin with simply loving yourself enough to allow your time right now to be great because you deserve it. Understand that we are all on our own journey, so assuming that someone is feeling a certain way is beyond what your life purpose is about. Enjoy your journey, and know that people have their own path and their own opportunities. Live for this moment.|`|JtQvOLqkaa	If u didn't actively pursue it with those intentions, no. Don't worry!|`|AA12185240	Not really maybe she was really mean to him see how it goes and don't rush into anything so as you don't get hurt your self O.K. good luck|`|XkPgw7ZRaa	No dear, All is fair in love and war as they always say.  You are young, do not feel the guilt.<br>  <br>  Press on.<br>  <br>  Anthony|`|MeGehliuaa	No! I've never gotten why one can't date ex's. Dw you are fine.|`|p6hIgKWTaa	you didnt technicly steal him you won him over that the way i look at it
0ClA7HlEaa	I have a friend just like that.<br>  <br>  Maybe she was jealous that you went to movies with your friends<br>  <br>  instead of her. she probably has slow self-esteem so she takes it on <br>  <br>  you. Find better friends. you dont deserve a so called friend like that,<br>  <br>  Does  she only hang out with you ? maybe shes a loner. If you want , <br>  <br>  Talk to her about it. Good luck girl! :)|`|d6175f7b88bb1f95594adc1c1ae4296eaa	I think she is just mean.<br>  It sounds that way.|`|D0nwGKHtaa	I think she is insecure so you should ignore and i know that's the annoying and typical advice but i found out its true|`|WDEWAR8Faa	yh probably just next time she tries to put you down try defend yourself a little more otherwise she'll get it in her head that she can get to you so don't let her think that|`|g8kbs8Idaa	Hey (:<br>  This sounds just like one of my friends.<br>  This is what my friend does.<br>  it just might be the fact that your a better person than she is!<br>  Also if you have a boyfriend, or are just more popular than her, this could trigger her to make her feel jealous towards you.<br>  But don't worry it's not your fault, it's her problem!|`|CXQoXep1aa	What i know from experience is that she has very low self esteem and since she has low self esteem she wants to bring you down because u are pretty and better than you but stop hanging out with her|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	Shes just a negative person you should limit the time you spend with her. Misery loves company. Just let the company not be you.|`|iJYtpvrBaa	your friends a moron, tell her when she says that next say "i didnt know you were a homophobe, that is so low even for you"
o3t6A4rRaa	just be normal and all will be okay|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	Just try to act like it doesn't bother you. I am guessing you did something to alienate them against you.I would just be patient and lets things blow over. Hang with some other people for a while.|`|g8kbs8Idaa	Maybe your feeling ignored because the new boy has joined your circle of friends and is funny and jokey, and is pushing your characteristic out.<br>  However much you like friends and like to hang round with them, maybe its time to find a new group of friends as it kinda seems like there not making the effort to include you.|`|WDEWAR8Faa	one just try regain your place (i know thats going to be hard) and get to know this new guy because it's better to get to know new friends so they know that your not just invisible. and try to have a conversation with your friends and tell them that your feeling left out
HCOmpFFOaa	omg what is happening to the world now/? <br>  everyone needs people from the net telling them what to do in each step of their lives!!<br>  <br>  ask one of ur mutual friends to tell him to ask u out ..tht will work|`|a1iam8Zvaa	ask a friend to set up a date or ask him for his number or AIM<br>  or ask him on a date<br>  go on a double date or something<br>  and do something lol before the feelings go away|`|bYGx8xdVaa	nothing|`|lFzFtiCBaa	Blow Him.....?!? what do you think you should do next?

Give your mother a Fifty Dollar gift card from her favorite store and and you should be home free.    You can buy her favorite perfume I still think my answer covers it all
9PaRdlwcaa	People make mistakes in life; it happens. If your wife sounds sincere when she apologized, then maybe you should forgive her. There may have been a reason behind it. She could feel neglected. You should set up a romantic night for the two of you, just to remind her how much you still care. And as for the ex, tell your wife how uncomfortable it makes you for the two of them to be friends. You've been married for nine years, so you should be able to have an open relationship.|`|AA11493831	If she's able to do it once, she'll be able to do it again and again.<br>  But I guess, everyone deserves a second chance. Specially if there are children involve in the situation.<br>  It really hurts a lot, to be cheated on. And I believe that infidelity, is one reason enough to destroy or end a relationship. I she cares and truly loves you she should've not done that, even if she's stinking drunk.|`|qajJfEeuaa	Yes, I know that it hurts but if she told you maybe she does truely regret it. Explain to her that if she ever do it again that you are gone. Don't let her contiune to disrespect you. Stand up for yourself. Pray to God about it. Ask him to get you guys through this.|`|Ag8pE3Cyaa	I don't get your story. Is she cheating or not?<br>  <br>  ADD: If she truly loved you she would not get drunk partying with men. The fact that she hangs with your ex is not the issue. Your wife is an adult, she decides on her own what will be her actions, not your ex. No one put a gun on her head and told her to get drunk and have sex with the first guy there. Letting people around her influence her is a sign of immaturity. If you want your marriage to get back on track then ask her to cut all contacts with your ex and her entourage, move from there if you have to. But, in my humble opinion, what's the use? she'll cheat on you next time she makes friends with someone else that's a little holley holley.|`|quMUHyPsaa	I'm not even sure what your question is?  Your wife is running around with your ex?  And she was drunk.  Did she cheat on you?  If she went out and got drunk and cheated on you then I would tell her to make a choice.  Grow up and be committed to your marriage and don't see your ex again or get out.  There isn't a reason to cheat.  If you can't control your liquor and cheat and have sex with people because of it you shouldn't drink so much in the beginning.  Bottom line, there is no excuse.
ivjHOJ8daa	Aww... you're so sweet!<br>  I am SO gonna get my boyfriend with this one when he comes home from work!!

No!  but a little gift never hurt anyone|`|lFzFtiCBaa	buy her a massage, girls seem to really like that.
05GK1SUTaa	Just let her go man, She isn't worth it. She don't know what she wants. You'll see she'll try to come back to you. Don't or not she will keep putting you in the same type of situation, how could you trust her anyways. The best thing to do is hang out with your friends, go out, have fun, take a little break on relationships. You don't wanna get with a girl just to forget about your ex. Imagine if the girl finds out, you'll end up hurting her. Just give things time and you'll see things come to place. Good Luck!|`|obGqYxG3aa	I know how it must feel for you after talking to the girl for six months and she just completely gives up on what you guys had, ESPECIALLY if she was saying that she had a great time with you and knew you would treat her better...but you know what? There's plenty of girls out there and you're still young. For you to move on, just keep yourself occupied...like hanging out with friends and meeting new people! Is there anything you've been wanting to do over the summer? Go do that! If you're taking summer classes, focus on your classes. Don't stress over her. If you're just going to be sitting by yourself, you're going to find yourself thinking about her and that's not going to help you move on at all. Hope that helped! :)
PREUMGZiaa	hmm it might be. have you talked to her at all? if she's avoiding you then yea, otherwise she just might take forever to anwser.|`|kbGOMwi7aa	tell her she "should say 'im not interested,'  because thats what a friend would do."  remind her that "I'm not interested" is not a definitive "no" and better than the open-ended "ill think about it."<br>  <br>    She'll thank you later so you better thank me. by giving me 10 points|`|XOlnc8iBaa	Next time you see her say a cute thing like "So are we on?"<br>  That will tell you. She is not interested, maybe you should save face and let it go.|`|iacvdnYTaa	I don't think her avoiding the subject is nice at all. It's very selfish of her. Maybe she's still thinking though. You've come this far already so you really need to take another step and remind her of your proposal. Her answer/reaction will clarify things for you without a doubt.|`|vWMNXNLraa	send her an e mail, asking her if shes thot about it enough and came up with an answer yet, be as nice and gentle as possible<br>  tell her its ok if its a no, tht ull understand<br>  or even better, ask her in person|`|ddcvo5YZaa	so far it is a no, but you'll find out down the line that a "no" isnt always that way with girls, there are times when they make up their mind and its made and you have no shot, and then there is the kind of "no" that means you have to convince her, I don't mean like a lawyer or a salesman trying to talk her into anything, so I'll answer this assuming you have some kind of shot but that its a "no" until you bring something more into it, next time you see her, bring it up AS IF you know its a "no", but follow up with something logical making the situation "no big deal" rather than "a date", the first time you asked her out it should have been something like "hey.... wats up ashley... (make small talk)...so I was wondering if ya wanted to grab a bite to eat tomorrow night (that makes it sound like its no big deal, dont call it dinner or a date)" , but since youve asked and shes said she will think on it and hasn't responded, then you have to be more blunt but nice, (do this if you really like her by the way, if you don't really care too much then just let it go), but if you like her bring it up and literally tell her (put her on the spot) if you see shes trying to wiggle around it by telling her "its just dinner its no big deal, we might have a good time, and if not.... then we're friends" be nonchalant about it and if you have a little chance, she'll agree, (you have some kind of shot with her, psychologically youve made her feel like a child for saying no, as if shes too scared to go out, she'll lean towards a "yes" just to soothe her ego, thats if you have a chance lol, dont feel bad, your not tricking her, the point is to get her on the date so you can show her your an awesome guy, so even if you manipulate her a little its ok) if she had a huge crush on you to begin with she would have said yes on the spot, but don't let that get you down, unless you lie to yourself you know your chances better than most, if shes on the fence about it, then being casual about the whole thing will make you seem really chill and she could end up saying yes.|`|Ap4aUgiZaa	well, the best way to find out is to talk to her. and think how it would affect things if you went out because you guys are great friends.<br>  think about if it would be akward when you guys break up or tear you guys apart.|`|k0B8err5aa	The answer is a 100% no. Just move on if you can. But if you really need closure just go ahead and ask if she's had enough time to think. Expect the worst though.
EG00oN53aa	i think u asked this question already. u even chose me 4 best answer. lol. but yea, like i told u the 1st time, i think she has a thing for you. shes just waiting for u to be a man and make the first move. ask her out boo!! u got nothing to lose.|`|ozi2GAzQaa	um, maybe... but probably not. <br>  Looking up and smiling is just something that people naturally do when other people walk by... most of the time. <br>  To early to tell though.|`|uxBnPqtYaa	how long have you known her? well if you tutor her you probably don't know her that well. i don't think she likes you but i definitely think she has a crush. if you have a crush on her then get to know her better. ask her out after tutoring. take things slow. good things come to those who wait :)<br>  <br>  best of luck?|`|V7976L4Daa	you are her tutor? you should not be messing around with your student. that is a federal offense and you can / will go to jail for it!|`|Fdzj3NN7aa	are u handsome? if u r, that's one thing for sure. she does like u. does she always look at u? if so, that means she really likes u or she really admire u. hope i helped.<br>  <br>  Jenah.|`|IPcyQcLbaa	um, no i think shes being nice by smiling, the gaze was probually waiting for you to help her out seening you are tutouring her? whats the age difference? and see if she does anything else|`|lumJDhIJaa	I vote maybe but you never know but if you like her try asking her out maybe she will say yes.

Does he seem ( to you, be honest) to treat you different when you are around "his" friends?<br>  4. Does he "like" your friends?<br>  5. Does he tell you how to dress?<br>  6.

Wait a little while before you say it, because if he is not feeling that yet you may scare him a little.

If you're not ready for a relationship, just let him know that and if he is a sweet guy than he will be very understanding. Don't give him the line "Its me not you", though, since thats so cliche its not even funny hehe. But yea just be honest with him and express to him how much his friendship means to you and that you don't want this to jeopardize that at all and that you just rushed into it too quickly.

1QSsOAAFaa	Avoid him. This isn't a perfect solution, because you're losing a friend, but that's probably the only way.<br>  This might seem weird, but you can try talking to your friend about your boyfriend. Tell him about what you like about your bf and why you're with him. Really, there's not much you can do to remove emotions.<br>  If your boyfriend is very understanding, and you're very careful about how you bring it up, you should tell your boyfriend how you feel about your friend. That way you won't feel guilty about keeping a secret. However, if you think he might get jealous or that it would surely cause drama, don't consider it.|`|zNR9Ik3Daa	my best friend is in the same situation.<br>  she likes the guy she's dating but loves this guy who's dating someone else. but neither of them know that.

Love never fails. therefore, it if fails, it is not love.<br>  simple as that.|`|rAvZ9yGcaa	Well I personally feel that if you love someone, you can't have feelings for someone else.  Then it means you're not in love with the one you think you love.<br>  <br>  You can't make them go away, really.  You just have to not act on those feelings and they'll disappear in time.|`|ea72e278c86998feb24f1ea73aabddb5aa	give yourself some time away from both,and decide who you really want to be with either way it goes someone feelings will get hurt. just follow your heart.|`|guxtikYCaa	They wont go away, Sounds like your not really in love with your bf but your in love with the old friend, when your truly in love you cant see yourself loving anyone else with that degree of  intimacy not only can you not see yourself but its not even possible.
N7gOE1btaa	Canada has many websites for online dating and also meet friends sites.  These are mainly out of the bigger cities, Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, Vancouver, but I think you can find one for just about anywhere.  Do a google search for such things, I haven't used them so I can't recommend one, but I am aware of their existence.

If he's trying to annoy you, he probably likes you. If he's just bored, well...he's bored. If you want him to stop just shock him. Say something like," Come here, Doggy!Come here! Come here!"<br>     See what he does. If you want to be mean just say,"What are you a puppy?! Go kennel up or something!"<br>      Don't listen to your friends when it comes to this. Think about it. Just because someone sneezes, you don't need to wipe their nose with a tissue and say,"Blow!"

That includes of course, the rent, the electric bill, water bill, gas bill,  cable/satellite TV bill, telephone bill, internet access, food, etc.  <br>  <br>  The bills that you and your roommate are responsible for separately, are anything you and he yourselves were paying for before you moved in together, such as car payments, credit card bills, cell phone bills, etc.  <br>  <br>  For personal reasons, it sounds as if you feel your boyfriend should be paying more.  If that is the case, you might want to sit down with him and discuss your ideas in regard to who pays for what.  Communication is the key to making your relationship work, especially since you are going to be living together.  If you don't feel  you can approach him in regard to the subject of money, then I would think twice before moving in together.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK and best wishes to both of you!!|`|lrVbZdSDaa	Well, while the situation will surely vary based on the individual situation, in general I would say 50/50.<br>  <br>  Nowadays the girl doesn't stay in the kitchen all day while the guy goes out and hunts so the girl can cook it for him ;)|`|xufESx85aa	I think it should be 50/50

Xkq5kHLNaa	Just dont have sex with him till youre 18. Otherwise if your folks find out and get all upset, they have legal charges that could send him to jail. But my hubbys 30 and im 23, so age diff is not a crime...just statutory rape is. <br>  Hope this helps:)|`|XwMn6aY5aa	its not that bad and the only way he can get in trouble is if YOU call the cops on him..but i think you wouldn't if you like him..so just enjoy life with him..^_^|`|cXAzfS46aa	How close are you to turning 18? If you have sex it can be considered statutory rape, even with your consent, in some cases. To just be together, it isnt a crime|`|u0eKwNuVaa	Wait until you're 18.  A three year age difference is nothing, but until you're 18, it is a crime.  There are guys on the sex offenders registry who are only one year apart from their girlfriend, but the girl is under 18.|`|OGROuK6Jaa	no go for it i don't see anything wrong with it<br>  as long as you w8 till your 18 to have sex other than that i don't see anything wrong with it as long as you two love each other|`|e9431e7aacbf06accd4aa1aae5cc622baa	It's only illegal if u have sex w/ him...Otherwise it's fine.|`|CCekEuhbaa	i dont know if this applies to where you live but in new york the age of consent is seventeen
Cye1NNWxaa	since you were out of society for a while (while on the dope) if you now back in education you are probably older than the other students, also if you were on meth you probably got the rotten teeth so thats a dead give away even without saying anything.<br>  also what was the reason you use to take dope did you feel back then that you didn't fit in all were a bit shy?<br>  if so then you coped by doing dope now that you are stronger you dont need dope the anxiety will slowly go as you discover your inner worth|`|VnX9UR1Faa	You most likely do scare them away but then that's their loss. You were willing to go this far and ask for help so it must've been a huge problem and i guess it still is. I say you stop caring about what they do. Just keep being the real you. Don't fake a smile just take it in. meet more people and be happy. It would probably also help if you only dated people you really cared for. I'm not saying you don't i'm just saying this out loud just in case. So the whole thing in short 1) be you 2) don't tak the easy way out and lie to yourself and say it's not that easy 3) love the people your with and if they make you feel bad confront them.<br>  <br>  Okay well bye bye you can message me if you want to yell at me for sticking my nose in your business lol :D

f5CsZYcDaa	So i take it as that you are a girl. I am thinking you are just bi curious. or something. it might go away. just take your time about what you really feel like you should be with a guy or a girl no rush. but just remember what you have with that 'amazing' guy you talk about|`|MeGehliuaa	You need to be sure though. Avoid any moves until you are definite regarding your feelings and sexual preferences. I don't think there's anything wrong with being gay but you need to be sure if it's out of logical reasoning. It all depends on the feelings you have for her, is it because she's the queen bee of the high school so she's somewhat godified? Make sure of your feelings before doing anything, maybe it's just admiration.|`|AA10545938	UR A ******* DICK SMOKER. u need to get your dick out of your gay friends *** and start putting it into a girls vagina|`|pxNnXwwBaa	go where your heart is telling you to go. im sorry if this sounds cheesy :)|`|Njgof6hNaa	Explore your options. You don't have to pick any which side. You don't have to put a label on yourself. <br>  This is different than being interested in another guy, because this girl might not be bi or a lesbian. She might be straight. I think what would help is to explore if you're into girls aside from this one. It would also help to see if you're interested in guys other than your bf. And work from there. You might like both or just one side. It'll make things clear for you. <br>  And remember that there's not shame in which gender you pick or if you decide you like both guys and girls. It's who you are and that's all that matters.|`|0pKjDxj4aa	your probably just going to through a stage. you might get over it. but if you keep getting more sexually attracted to girls...then you might be lesbian...or bisexual|`|sVstXgc6aa	That can happen.

I think you should go with your heart and do what feels right.|`|VqWBGWAoaa	Confused is right.|`|r4UgFabFaa	you might be turning lesbian wa tyu need to do is stay away form girls for awhile or just go with it and tell your friend that|`|kQgSi1MEaa	Your bisexual sweetie.

N7gOE1btaa	When you inform her that you sent the flowers, you should ask her out for something simple, like coffee.  That way you have a friendly date with no pressure and its easy going.  If you just tell her you sent the flowers and all that but don't ask her out, then you are some creep who just sent her flowers and she might be weirded out by that.  I think what you did is really nice, and I'm sure she thinks so too.  So tell her, and then ask her out for coffee sometime.  Then give her your number to call you.  That way she knows your intentions and also has time to process it because she has your number.  As for breaking down defenses, you've done all you can do.  You've softened her up big time before you let her know it was you.  Now its time to be yourself and ask her out dude.
mxrYe9qMaa	Well I'm a dude and i went with my friends, no dates, but we all danced with the ladies that had no one to dance with, so I'm sure if you go some one that likes you will ask you to dance, hope that answer some of your question.

Hey! It's your life. If you think this is the only way to get it out of your system, then just go for it. Right now, your status is single. If your ex gf decides to take you back days later, she does not really hv the right to be upset with you when she finds out, right?|`|db4310b357e8b8155cfe1bd956cf7660aa	It will make you feel good UNTIL your she finds out what you've done. Then, she will be asking herself why ,in the hell, would she want to be with someone who *#%*'s the first thing that comes along. I don't care if she broke up with you or not. <br>  Allow me to put it to you another way:<br>  You already know the answer to your question,you're just looking for someone to tell you it's okay to do this. <br>  Listen to your heart NOT your body.|`|HH6cIYUjaa	You're a dick.|`|uXFdeKGPaa	too right a will lol
yr9KYRgpaa	Okay so i have been in this situation before but my advice is dont tell your friend just yet its just a crush keep in contact with him and if it lasts long and you feel something serious then talk to your friend and see how she feels|`|058qleIWaa	thats hard but honestly i would just not mention it for a while and keep it on the same level you have it now because once yall start dating, you friend may not care but at the same time you will NEVER be able to have "relationship talk" with your friend again because then you are making that person choose between you and the brother.<br>  then when / if you break up its just going to cause negative tension every time you go to your friends house.<br>  <br>  nothing good will come out of it as much as you believe it will and im sorry to say that because its so hard to deny crushes but i think thats what you should do for the sake of your friendship.|`|gsem4EnYaa	doing this might mess up your relationship with your friend

You are both young and still have alot to go through, if the love you say is true and is strong/real you both will figure out a way to come to a compromise.<br>  If not, then you just have to refigure your life out. :) like i said, you are young and i know how you feel but approach the situation like an adult and talk about it.|`|EwvZCLkjaa	calm down<br>  if you keep being controlling like this she'll dump you for it<br>  if she wants to smoke let her, its her body she can ruin her lungs if she wants<br>  if you dont like kissing her after tell her<br>  and as for it being so illegal, as long as she didnt buy them im pretty sure its not illegal|`|h17TYupuaa	You can't force anyone to do anything, it's a free world.

I'm sure she will pick your feelings over something like this.|`|UFvn0kZ2aa	Tell her that she needs to probably chose between you, or cigarettes.

I've lost 4 family members to lung cancer so i know how it is. If she doesn't ever understand then you may be able to anonomously go to someone else so that she won't get mad at you and she'll also be able to understand how bad smoking is.|`|Ix4wLPJ5aa	Ok first of all about the being in love with her...   I can believe you are. I am 15 and I'm in love with a girl.  <br>  <br>  And about the question. You should talk to the girl how her smoking makes you feel. And maybe she will see that smoking isn't good for you and that it can destroy friendships and relationships. Maybe you cab save a life. And it makes me feel good that I'm helping you save a life.|`|I1kfSC1Daa	go to truth.com...it's a website that shows all the dangers of smoking along with some scary pics of what happens when you smoke...show her that maybe that will wise her up. My dad died of lung cancer, before he died he had to have a hole cut in his throat and part of his tounge cut out because his mouth was also full of cancer...sorry to be graphic, but if its enough to gross her out and keep her from smoking then good.|`|RXmWudcsaa	That is awful. Tell her how you feel and how unhealthy that is for her. Let her know that its very unattractive for a young man to see that in a young lady. Praying helps too. Pray for her. Does her mom and dad know.... try to talk to her calmly and explain these things to her.|`|TT43pWMlaa	Take her meet with a woman in your family that smoke. Let her stay with the woman. She will smell the bad air  that come through the woman's mouth. You told her that you hate the smell.|`|HJHfKpspaa	Just tell her how you feel. Let her know it is important to you that she doesn't smoke. You want her to be healthy and you don't want to go out with anyone who smokes so you have to tell her that.|`|c2b0c54ac5bc43be413eb1675d56c4ffaa	Listen, you're only 14.  Kids do and try a lot of stupid things.  It was 1 cigarette and maybe she was just curious about it.  Tell her you dont like it, and don't worry so much about it.|`|Jfj1tLlbaa	let her make her own path in life. keep telling her how much you love her and good things about her and maybe eventually she wont need to continue smoking.|`|Z3i2q2wuaa	show her some samples like a picture of a lung who is a cig smoker and tell her the consequences of smoking...|`|Emx7bwDVaa	If she has only ever smoked one... and it was a while ago I wouldn't worry about it.<br>  <br>  Did she say that she didn't like it?|`|mMzUaqyWaa	Children smoking, however stupid it might be.. is not illegal.|`|ayby0npIaa	bryce your so cute(the way you think, your innocence) yes she is wrong for smoking, she needs to stop. why dont you threaten to tell her parents?|`|pA7620wBaa	Give her some weed too.|`|N7gOE1btaa	All you can do is tell her that it bothers you and you don't like it because its unhealthy, illegal, and just a habit that isn't likeable.  But as for getting it through her head, thats up to you.  You don't own her, she is just a girlfriend at this point.  If she wont listen to you (and she really doesn't have to), then you need to make a decision about if this is the kind of person you want to be with.  Yes, I know you love her, but sometimes in life you have to make very tough choices if you see a behaviour that you really don't like and can't handle.  Be compassionate when you tell her about how much it bothers you though, make sure you don't yell or try to sound right or smarter.  Just level with her and I hope it works out.|`|UG2VpQjaaa	I won't doubt your saying you love her, that's not relevant in my opinion.<br>  <br>  Just ask her why she did it and if it was on some dumb dare then you're probably safe, but just give her a firm but gentle warning and explain how you feel about it. Don't seem controlling or otherwise the teenage spirit will kick in and she'll do it ten times as much as she would have planned on.<br>  <br>  I used to be sort of addicted, it's kind of tough to resist occasionally so try and have her avoid cigarettes for a few weeks, I didn't even smoke the damn thing and the fumes got to me, I had a weird craving for a few weeks so just take that advice.

4TqadRJYaa	I was in the EXACT EXACT EXACT same situation as you, and i am dating my friends sister and have been for over 2 years, and we are very much in love!

Everything worked out fine in the end for me!|`|VxySsVbwaa	It will screw up your friendship more than likely. I was in a similar situation and almost lost my best friend.

rhsP7LoQaa	hm common passion..<br>  idk.. to me passion is lovve... and love is when you would do anything for that person a fire burning in you that no matter what the flame will never burn out and you don't ever want it to... passion is when you hug kiss... make love with somebody and feel as if you were one.. and were made for ashore..and like no one in the world could ever give you enough cash to get rid of this feeling... like i mentioned before its like a wild fire in a forest except the fire is spreading to your heart body and soul every single organ that you possess that's what i think passion is..

My good friendships are with the people I share the most with: including the effort we put into - and the value we place upon our friendships.|`|jGcYPCWJaa	Wow Honey. Five years is a long time to forget about. My advise to you is this:<br>  <br>  If things have progressed to the point of silence and you are really interested in finding out if there is anything in your friendship worth saving find someone to act as a mediator between the two of you, a neutral party. The key to mediation is that both parties are willing to resolve their issues with each other.  You should be upfront and honest with your friend when discussing your feelings. It might help to write a list of fond memories that you have shared together and remind her of some of them. In the end it will take work on both parts to make your friendship what it once was. Only you will know for sure if she is a healthy person to have in your life. Hope this helps a bit. Good luck!
Mt1b8dKsaa	No, she's just generous and respectful. Guys seem to have problems apologizing sometimes.

You need to be more confident.  You may have confidence in other areas, and lack confidence specifically when dealing with the opposite sex (like me, I'm working on this), but you need to find a way to channel positive self-image into your relationship with her, we all have a negative and positive self-image, theres just some kind of a displacement that can happen and she will pick up on it.|`|YNOySbxFaa	i dont think saying sorry really means anything. i once said sorry to the    person i hated the most in school. but thts only cuz i did something bad to him, and i didnt want to get suspendid. and no i didnt intimidate him, or make fun of him. it was HONESTLY harmeless. but he was stupid. and made a big deal out of nothing litterally -.- .. once he was mad. so he walked out of class, and hit the wall. and i said WATCH OUT OR THE WALL'LL HIT BACK! . and he ran off, told the teacher, and got me in SOO much trouble.|`|eTm9uLqyaa	It depends on many things.<br>  Like me for example.

eNMRIKL6aa	This is a complex issue. Even older experienced people get confused on this one. The problem is, the girl is not sure about how she feels about you, and/or is undecided about you when you initially ask her out. That's why you should not say "So, this is a real 'date' right?" because she hasn't really decided about it yet.<br>  <br>  Society, on the other hand, will define it as a date if you go alone with her for a meal or a show, especially if you pay for everything. So, you should assume it's a date, even if she's not willing to admit it yet at this point.<br>  <br>  As for how to ask her out, it requires some finesse. You should start up a conversation first, and you want to smoothly transition into the subject of going out. Usually people will pick a moment when you are both laughing and in a fun mood, and say "So, hey...what are you doing this weekend?" this gives them an easy out before you try to go in for the kill. If she says "nothing much.." then you have the green light. At this point you must not hesitate! Be confident and just say "would you like to <fill in the blank>" This is a tried and true method and you shouldn't go wrong this way.<br>  <br>  Happy hunting|`|8P64hgL3aa	You shouldn't be too direct or too indirect. Implying is the best way. Like if you don't know the girl as much, you can bring an excuse or just guide the conversation in a way and ask her if she wants to have dinner or go for a movie. If you know the girls more, you can be more direct. For example me and my gf were laying down on her bed and I asked her if she thinks things will work out if we're more than friends and she gave me a direct answer.<br>  good luck|`|Wj7mBxFJaa	my exact words were<br>  "Will you go out with me?"<br>  call it lame if you will, it did the job.  that's when our actual relationship started though we had gone on some almost-but-not-really dates before then<br>  granted, we had known each other for close to a year and were very close, and she liked me enough i could have said just about anything and she woulda said yes

XH2o1MM6aa	.Sex doesn't cement a relationship.More often it destroys it. Best to cut off his sexual wants and concentrate on building up the romance.Without sex.

Maybe the best way you can get over her is to try and talk to her so you realise she is only human, you will probably find out stuff about her that you don't like. It's easy to put someone you don't really know on a pedastal and make them out to be 'the one' when you don't really know them. So i say get to know her and discover her flaws, good luck! :)<br>  I get in that situation all the time at university.|`|oDsFSXhhaa	I don't see why you are being so hard on your self. You sound like you are level headed so you know opposites attract. You could be good for each other. When was the last time  you took a break and partied.

If you don't like her after then fine, no harm done.|`|nkCHh8T3aa	Hey Man I know how you feel cause ive been through that!!!!!<br>  all you need to do is try to get back to gether beacuase youre in love and you need each other!!!!! well atleast thats what i did and ive never been better

Be honest with her though, and take complete responsibility for your actions in the past.<br>  Let her know that you still care, and that you've changed and seen the errors in your past ways. Even if she's hesitant to get back together just offer the option of you being in her life to hang out occasionally.<br>  But just let her know that you wanna be around for her...<br>  Good luck, and I hope it goes your way, it sounds like those feelings are seriously strong!|`|o7KTOHbXaa	Maybe tell her how you feel, or if its possible make it obvious somehow.|`|UCX1JfFTaa	if all girls knew you talked like that, theyd love you
sLDqymHzaa	If she's got a boyfriend, back off. Stay friends, but don't go for anything more unless she ends it with her current boyfriend. You can't decide that she "thinks" she loves him, and you can't decide that you're the only one that really cares. Give it time, but DO NOT put her in a position where she ends up cheating on her boyfriend. Nothing good can come of that. Plus, if she cheats on him for you, what makes you any different for some other guy? Let it go naturally, don't try to take her from him either. She'll make the decision.
QeX89rP2aa	i am 14, and of course, i want a guy that cares about me and loves me as a person. i know its different for every girl. some girls just dont want a guy that is all nice and caring. i know it sounds so stupid, but i guess some girls are just so attracted to that. i am NOT one of those girls. i need a guy that cares about me. and my boyfriend just broke up with me so i am in that stage where im like "damn, i should have gone for the nice boy" because my ex boyfriend was bad:( i know i said it isnt attractive, but for me, it was when we started dating... so to answer your question, i guess for me i was 14 when i realized i need a caring guy...haha|`|oDsFSXhhaa	Wow.

Probably your personality changed as well. Maybe, they could not keep up with the changes. Maybe, they don't like your personality now that you've changed so much. I don't think they don't like you anymore just because of what you do.<br>  <br>  But, you shouldn't worry about those kind of things.<br>  Get new friends that suits you more if you want.|`|WAl3vvNnaa	I can not count the number of times my friends said that I have changed. Changing is a part of life and no one can stop it. It sounds to me like you are doing good, well despite the weed. But if you are happy then your happy.

WewCtMpzaa	What's wrong with a little small talk to pass the day? You can be a good worker, and still be a social person. Although I see where you are coming from, and just want to be a valuable worker who will be rewarded, there is something else with being a good worker, is being a good friend and team member to all, even if you do not particularly care for them. <br>  <br>  When you clam up, or distance yourself from your team, you put up barriers. Once you do that, it's seen as all kinds of negatives which could cause your other team members to react in weird ways. Imagine how you would feel if everyone in your office avoided you, and did not speak with you. You might enjoy the peace, but it would be your death nail because once people no longer waste their time with you, they in their collective action know you have no political power, and will be washed on the next layoff season, or will either push out of their team, or will promote you out to get you away from them. This could be seen as a good thing with the promotion, but it's often to a rough or nasty group in their eyes. <br>  <br>  I would take it easy, do a little small talk just to get your team comfortable with you. Being green and new, your interest may be trying to make a good impression, but you have to play the entire field, not just the good worker. It will make you look like the one who will want to make everyone else look bad, and your team, even your manager will trip you up not because your a good worker, it will be because you will be a threat to their livelihood, and people can do desperate and despicable things if you become a threat.|`|36PrVK7Oaa	I lot of business make personnel decisions based on who they like, not how well they work.  It is a fact of life so do not ignore it. Time to think about changing jobs.<br>  *<br>  If you really care, you can research "goal-oriented behaviour" and "social-oriented behaviour" in various small group interaction studies. All the things you have discussed have been researched.<br>  *<br>  You may want to set up this manager for a nice fat sexual harassement settlement. $$|`|8K3IucU3aa	sounds like people acting stupid at work. don't let it bother you. maybe they will finally get the point that you want them to leave you alone. if you get involved with them it sounds like you'll be in a lot of work drama and that's the last thing you want seeing how you're a great worker. if you want to you can tell them that you're busy and you'll chat later.|`|AA10240683	He may be trying to flirt with you, he could be bored with his job and seeks out other women to talk to. It could be a lot of things. If you are uncomfortable with this social interaction on the job, you must first tell him about it. If he does it again AND affects your job performance, then it would be a case of harassment.|`|vcGc4Wb9aa	I see alot of backstabbing is happening here. The fool manager is afraid you will take over his place and wants you out of the way. Stick to your place and ignore them totally as though they are some flies and that will make them more upset. They are up to something so be away from them and dont chat with them.It is obvious they gossip behind you and the bitching is high.If i was you i would look for work in different place.

I go through the same thing at my workplace and I am targeted simply because I don't involve myself in the gossip. It happens, keep your head up and don't let them bother you. You're at work to...well, work, and make a living. Why worry about what the people there do and say?|`|Ag8pE3Cyaa	You did this to yourself by being marginal and not blending in. When you start a job in a new place you have to try to fit in....not stay away and give out an attitude like you're better then all of them.|`|2x0jVI57aa	Wow. Did you finish college?|`|DuTeclwuaa	Let's sample the grammar of someone who claims to do great work in corporate, shall we?<br>  <br>  "which HAVE departments"<br>  <br>  "the latest RECRUITE."<br>  <br>  "why do U come here?"<br>  <br>  "to make small TALKS"<br>  <br>  "he HAVE watched."<br>  <br>  "I have NOTICE"<br>  <br>  That plus your darling user name - "F*ck The World" and honey I wouldn't hire you to take out the trash at my place. <br>  <br>  We are the only species on Earth that writes. So it is closely tied to intelligence and therefore the ability to perform *numerous* jobs. If you have terrible writing skills, then [1] you didn't listen in school so you won't listen here at work, [2] you don't read much or enjoy reading so you won't read much here, and [3] you didn't apply yourself then so you won't apply yourself now. <br>  <br>  Your coworkers probably do all your work for you and are amazed you can even turn a cell phone on without having a 2001: A Space Odyssey chimp-like reaction to it.|`|jBigEy0Caa	They obviously had some kind of inside joke that struck them funny at that moment.  Maybe something happened to one of their cell phones and they were just laughing about it.  Happens all the time between friends, and if they spend time together I'm sure they are friends.  These people are just trying to be nice to you and I'm surprised they keep trying since you blow them off constantly.  It is much easier to work in an environment with people you like and have something in common with, but I have worked many places where you have that one who just thinks they are better than everyone else.  Maybe he was laughing because the "Blackberry" is not exactly new, and maybe he already has one, and he was just making small talk?  Who knows?
c8DjmWXxaa	your 14 years old, your taking drugs and your stealing from the very people that gave you life, have spent thousands of dollars raising you, looked after you when you couldn't and have loved you since day one, you need a serious lesson, do you honestly think that your parents are their just to be abused by you, you deserve everything that is coming to you, your a very rotten person to treat anyone that way let alone your parents.<br>  if you have any morality in you at all then you will grow up and start taking responsibility for your actions, you can start to owning up to what you did, and do not run away, what you gonna do then without parents, i doubt that you have real friends that could trust you.<br>  and you really think that im gonna try and help you, you sound to me like someone who is idiotic enough to constantly have to learn things the hard way.<br>  to everyone else reading my answer, im sorry for being so harsh but sometimes it's gotta be told like it is, i know you guys understand, your thumbs up is proof.|`|GIlTkQu6aa	1st i got to say you are sick<br>  tell your parents you are sorry and dont run away. i would slap my kid too|`|K2dv9u7baa	You should tell them about the credit card, be mature and take responsibility for your actions.

I mean, I wasn't exactly your perfect angel teenager and I agree that parents often overreact and are unfair but stealing your parent's credit card and lying and keeping drugs in their house (taking drugs is your own choice and maybe not their business, but in their house then it is their business) are very good reasons why they would be mad at you and ground you.<br>  I think you should apologise and behave better.|`|ffqsWfZtaa	Your taking serious risks of mental health smoking weed before fully mature, but nthat'll not bother you 'cause you probably think 20 is old.<br>  <br>  Both my kids smoke weed but didn't start till 18, ok they drank from about 14.<br>  <br>  If you'r dad gave you his pin so you could use his credit cardfor something and now you've abused this trust your in the **** for sure.<br>  <br>  Admit your having problems, try to be more sane and keep it down for a bit, you could probably realy impress them by getting part time job and pay for your own weed.<br>  <br>  The 130$ depends on your familys income, for some people it means no eating for a month, for others it means missing a round of golf, or not eating out one night.<br>  <br>  But basically the amount doesnt matter, youve broken trust, and that'll take a lot of effort to regain|`|YSom6ZeMaa	GROW UP,GET A BRAIN,AND GO F*** YOURSELF.

ab1735b1185c7e42bcba37deb9057a6aaa	Quiet and shy is fine.  Effeminate is not.  The two don't necessarily go together.  There are pro football players who are quiet and shy.  Mechanics, ranchers, Marines, all can be quiet and shy.  Effeminate is a way that a man carries himself that says "if you hit me I'll cry".  You can just look at them and know they'd have no clue how to fix a car, or a bicycle or install a ceiling fan.  I think if an effeminate guy were to learn these things, and do other guy stuff too, like bulk up or take martial arts, they'd feel more confident, lose the esteem issues and shed the effeminate label.  And most importantly keep the marshmallowy inside intact.|`|VnX9UR1Faa	i'm pretty sure you have confidence and i know your humble. you can admit all this so i know i'm right. Probably cause it's more of a shy girls life you seem to be living. but i actually see you as a good guy and nowhere near that label lol. maybe it's cause i know alot of guys like you :P|`|XOUWsr8Qaa	you are as confident as you feel and act. If you are nice to a girl and listen to her, she will like you. it really is that simple!!|`|C3yE261uaa	I say I love shy guys they are rare today|`|HPO87jGiaa	Another guy's view:  I use to be much like that until middle school when I became a social butterfly.  It feels much better to have confidence, being with other people, building relationships, and to just be the guy that everyone would love to be around.  But everyone has their own views, so it can be anything depending on the girls' perspectives.|`|9ayA14Hraa	Do you love secrets and gossip? I doubt you like gossip. You're shy and quiet, that doesn't make you less of a man, maybe you should become a writer or something like it...|`|I6f6qtJTaa	Shy guys aren't rare at all, you just never hear them speak up.|`|dPgc8p9saa	marry me!! just kidding!! i think it's cute though..if thats what makes you YOU then I think any real girl would be able to accept that!!
bEJHO123aa	Yes, but it doesnt ever stay the same. I love them both equally, but at any given time i could choose which one i'd rather spend the day with. I used to feel guilty about it. It all depends on my mood and thier behavior and the circumstances, etc.<br>  <br>  And its not always the one who is best behaved. The one who is worst behaved often get and needs the most love and attention. Sometimes its about how much they need you.|`|HKkbqlIuaa	Some do, but there are a lot who don't. When I was younger, I was convinced that my sister was the favorite. My aunts and uncles even agreed with me. They always thought she got treated better because she was allowed to do things I could never do, and they always favored her more. Now that I am older, I look back and realize they did not love her more just differently. Firstly, I am the first born and they were too strict with me. I think they realized that and tried to do better with their second child. As for things she was allowed to have, we were in a much different financial situation then than we were when I was really young.<br>  <br>  I think that each child needs a unique parenting style. For instance, some children need to be grounded for punishment, while others need to have their chores doubled. It might look as though one is the favorite, but in most cases I think its just different personalities need different kinds of attention. Well, I hope I explained that well. I don't think parents always get the differentiation right, but they do their best. For example, one person mentioned their 28 year old brother still lives at home and gets money. She may let him live their because she loves him, but who do you think she's more proud of? If a parent is put in the position to help their child, they usually will. Your mother probably knows that you are smart and determined enough to be on your own. She pushes you to be the best you can be. Your brother probably utilizes his mother's love for him. Believe me, if you went crying home and played your cards right, she'd let you live there too. A parent wants to help their child at all costs, it's natural. When one child plays on those feelings, they have everything at their fingertips. Believe me, I'm sure you mother wishes your brother was more like you every day of her life.|`|GzL8X6vTaa	I won't say that I have a favorite but I do have two kids and I do favor one a little more then the other.<br>  <br>  I do love them the same and I would never let it be known and I treat them both exactly the same.<br>  <br>  They don't love one more then the other but they do favor one a little more.<br>  <br>  Anyone who says different is just lying.|`|mVxayJAhaa	for most of the time yes, although parents always insist that they love each and every single one equally. <br>  <br>  It's the same with teachers who actually ought to mark objectively, but still have a favorite students that they give some sort of preference, I guess.|`|Mglx0SA4aa	I believe they do, for example my mom favors my oldest brother<br>  even though he is a useless bum she gives me him money<br>  even though he's 28 he gets to live at home, she treats him<br>  I think its not intentional but many parents do it.|`|DEIxwvKPaa	oh ya for sure<br>  my parents love my younger brother more.  alot more.<br>  they deny it tho.  <br>  it is VERY obvious tho.  <br>  its pissin me off.|`|HE56Jra6aa	No, they love all their children unconditionally.|`|pnMjJ3s1aa	they love all their children its just they favor the one who gets the most achievements and want better|`|955875037481fa5fb2c9c0e960a79f63aa	Its kind of hard to explain, yes parents love all there children, but is there one in particular? Hummm..... Well I have 3 kids I love them all.  Each one of my kids has different things that I love about them. One really likes school and I love helping her with her school work.  One kid doesn't do well in school & dread helping her with school.  The other one well at the moment shes not old enough to tell yet what i like about her, but she gets alot of the attention right now. Shes only 2 months old.  The one that does bad in school, she loves helping me clean what mom wouldn't like that.  So I don't believe that its a favorite child thing I think its more of what activity your doing at the moment. I hope this helps.|`|c3474cd1d5137c5d6298fa6134dcf3c8aa	Some do, but most don't.  While I was pregnant with my second, I worried about how I would balance the two of them, but I have come to find out that it is just second nature. I love my boys equally. They are completely different but I love them both for their unique qualities.|`|nqkXE1cUaa	Most of the time, no.<br>  But in some situations, yes.|`|o6xLWwZvaa	I think so.<br>  <br>  For instance. I know that I am my parents favorite child. I was, when I was a kid and I am now. My parents and my sister don't get along much.<br>  <br>  My sister has 3 boys ages 11,6,3. I would say her favorite is the 6yr old. She lets him get away with anything. Lets him having an extra snack or drink soda..when the 11yr old can't.|`|agGG5LX8aa	Yeah my mom likes my brother more.

zzaScg0haa	It sounds like he likes you however there really isn't much you can do to avoid it except to not hang out with him as much, it could also be something as simple as the fact he could be having issues with his girl
SLcpYgEdaa	Don't get feared, do what is right....|`|ANWuCAnyaa	Sometimes you just have to put yourself out there. <br>  <br>  Try having your new friends share something with you first, then you share something with them. It makes it easier to open up when you know other peoples weaknesses too.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA10789220	So, you expect to move again, and don't want to get attached? <br>  <br>  I  don't understand how you "lost everything" with your old friends. That might have been true in the days before electricity, but now we have things like Facebook and Skype.<br>  <br>  addendum: You know that you must make friends eventually, and that eventually you will lose them too. By why is that a reason to suffer now? That's like refusing to get married because you husband will probably die sooner than you 50 years from now.
iOa7rriGaa	Well if your not in a relationship then yes more than a couple of questions would be a turn off since your not together but one or two would indicate you are interested in her.I don't think she'll think your insecure unless you are in a relationship together. If she likes you then she could be testing you but if she feels you are just a friend then she talks so much about him because she has some interest in him. Even if your in a relationship too many questions get irritating because the person your with will feel you don't trust them and that is not the way you want to go.|`|6lleH29faa	I think jealousy makes us feel that you really like us. :) so for me, it is not a turn off. I actually think it's cute. :D<br>  <br>  *is she talking about him because she's interested in him, or is she teasing me, or both<br>  ~if she knows you like her, it'd probably be, like, she's making you jealous or yeah, teasing you for you to come out.|`|48HKDSR0aa	i am guilty of this as I have talked to the guy i actually like (and likes me back) about other guys...<br>  <br>  Nobody has really acted negatively regards these small acts to provoke jealousy because I don't seriously mean it...<br>  <br>  Im not sure about your question but when a girl talks about another guy, just jokingly/flirtatiously reply. it would show that you can handle it and that you are a funny guy|`|xCP1mybiaa	Heck yes. Its a major buzz kill.<br>  <br>  I interpret that as a huge lack of trust on their end.|`|AA11441704	not too much...........she will know that you are interested......and care.........but ..........u be careful
oiB4KATuaa	I think it is a turn off, I mean sometimes in very small doses it can be flattering, like you know the guy must like you, but anything more and it just makes the guy look insecure, you should act like there is no competition for you and you're the best thing since sliced bread and the girls will believe it too! (not in an arrogant way though) She could just be talking about him without relaising that it could be making you jealous, or she might like him or she might be trying to make you jealous, which is pretty immature, so I suggest if she does talk about other guys just act totally disinterested and it'll make her want you more!|`|X4Owk0xTaa	It's not really a turn-off but you have to know your limits. If you ask too many questions it may put her off because you're sounding too clingy and stalkerish. If it's only one or two then I guess that's okay, she'll sense some interest in you. And she probably gets a kick out of seeing you a tad jealous because it makes her feel wanted. I think she's teasing you.|`|z0vylug1aa	kinda it is.<br>  It just makes you go, dawg hes always sweatin my nutts, im done.<br>  <br>  We want our space.<br>  The chiller you are the more she'll want you(:<br>  <br>  if you act like you dont care about this guy, she be like hmmm. whats up with this guyy(you)..|`|M7r7gHNGaa	Jealousy is always a turn-off because it shows a lack of confidence and trust in the partner and the relationship in general.|`|vMKEg29kaa	No its not a turn off at all... if i were this girl i would be happy knowing that there is someone pretty interested about who I am.

hnc7Epqdaa	You wrote that your trying to tell yourself that he wasnt a good boyfriend, thats okay. What he did to you was painful I assumed, you wrote that he caused extra stress to you and thats the key here. When were in a relationship it is important for that person not to forget there own feelings. If we forget ourselves,easily enough some one else we'll forget us. So what we have to do, in this case what you should do is take some time for yourself. Date yourself, love yourself, aprreciate yourself and find a reason to do so everyday. Maybe one day you love your hair, the next you may love the fact that you helped your neighboor or a friend. Why do this? because when we can go pass each day recognizing how unique we are, and the joy be bring to others. Not only do we make others feel good, but ourselves as well. Dont run away from your  feelings, cry if you have too. Laugh if you have too. Try to stay connected to what your feeling, be it anger or frustration. The more you get to notice that you are valauable in every way and demostrated to yourself in these way or which ever feels comfortable, you will began to feel good and understand that no matter who comes and ago you are there for yourself. Guys, they love a girl who is confident and shows them shes capable of doing things on her own. Ignore this guy and spend time with yourself. When a guy truly likes you and gets ignore by you because your to busy on yourself, he realizes he isnt the onlt thing that can keep you happy, therefore they do as hard as they can to keep you because they know they can lose you any moment. This guy in the other hand broke it off before anything occur, so he surely didnt care about your feelings. Im not going to tell you to or not to give him a chance, that is for your own heart to decide. But before you do put yourself first before any guy and let them come to you and demostrate to you they are worth your time. Wprk on your confidence and le him come to you if he does test him before anything serious begins between you too. maybe date for several months, if you do this date other guys as well so that you can have multiple opportunities incase this guy acts out again. If he doesnt come back love youself anyways and date as well, the bigger your self esteem the more guys will be attracted to you. This guy doesnt seem committed and ready for a relationship because when someone is there honest. I would suggest you to work on yourself and date let him be the second round this time if you decide to give him the chance so that he can see you arent going to put up with no games. But you know you can have thousands to choose from if you want to, because you can be that fantastic and mysterious when you love yourself first. But most importantly listen to your feelings. Dont hesitate to contact me if you have to, I will gladly help. (you can search for self esteem books, or articles), believe me you will have the biggest attraction with the transformation you can do to yourself. Just try it, it works for so many others and it can work with you as well. XoXo|`|4XCg1mIMaa	He's not worth it. He didn't take the relationship seriously and you guys had just started. If he will cheat when there is no problem, I guarantee the first problem that arises he will cheat again and he probably will go all the way...if he hasn't already. Thank God that you found out early on......It's not easy to forget someone you really liked and move on but, just keep telling yourself that you are doing yourself a great favor.....Sorry about what happened.... I hate to see someone's feelings hurt.......Nissa|`|Yv6pa3QAaa	yeah hun, forget him.  find a guy who will treat you right and NOT CHEAT ON YOU!  if you got back with this guy, he will just cause you more stress, dissapointment, and heartache.  the guy should be calling the girl and making all the effort to be with us.  and if you get back with him, he could cheat on you again!  once a cheater, always a cheater.. so they say.  but good luck and be strong and go out and meet a new guy <3 :)|`|UgJtnut4aa	Forget him, you dont need a loser like that in your life.<br>  You just have to move on, it happened to me but the best thing to use to your advantage is time, it takes a while but it heals everything and it makes you forget :)|`|ECnoUtXYaa	The choice is really yours. You can get back with him if you want to but remember that you guys might break up for the same reasons again. In my opinion, i don't think he's worth it. If he has the nerve to cheat like that then he deserves a kick in that place.Go get a good guy that won't do that to you and one that cares about you and loves you a lot :)|`|kH0P9P9Naa	Okay, well first he sounds like an ***. I don't know you, but I don't need to to know that you don't deserve that crap. Any guy who cheats on you isn't worth your time. Second, if you're not allowed to date it makes any type of relationship hard. When I got grounded a year ago I wasn't allowed to see, text, or call my bf for a month. It was pretty much just a "school relationship." And trust me, those don't really work unless the guy is super crazy into you. By the sounds of it, it doesn't sound like this guy is. So...my advice? Move on and find a guy whose not a jerk. Believe me, there's lots out there (:|`|nlqVEjhQaa	As a guy, I think that all he wanted was action and no relationship. You don't want to be with someone who would do that to you. I've been in that situation and although they may make your heart melt or they're good looking or whatever, they're still not good people.<br>  Once a cheater, always a cheater.|`|64Vq26Yiaa	Sometimes you need to forget what you want and remember wat you deserve. It seems to me that he didnt care, because if he did then he wouldnt have pulled something like that. Just keep your head up, because he's not worth your time. Someone that deserves you will come along sooner or later:)|`|d5fcb2Ioaa	yeah definitely dont try to get back together with him. what if he isnt feeling you? than it wont work. plus he is a dick for doing that and no one should ever give guys that do that kinda thing a second chance.|`|XZwkLeZ9aa	If you go back, he'll do the same to you, if he'll get back with you.<br>  But he said that he didn't.  It's his loss!!!  There are other fishes in the pool...hit the next button!!|`|ADpPVwdNaa	Once a cheater, always a cheater. Unless he gets a huge attitude check and rearranges his priorities, I'd say just leave him. He's not worth your precious time.|`|FLWuVKWnaa	OMG, forget that moron. Go get yourself a nice guy that will be faithful.|`|1GSMGJWJaa	ditch him|`|4j6DSEqFaa	ask yourself this: Why should I get back with a guy that hurt me? I bet you cant answer the question. If he really liked you he wouldn't have let a girl get close enough to touch him like that. I think you need to forget him why get back with a boy that caused you heartache. I bet that soon enough or later you are gonna find I guy you really like (more than him) and he's gonna treat you nice and then you are going to ask yourself: Why was I trying to get back with him anyway? then you may call yourself stupid. LOL Anyway I can't say if you are or aren't but:<br>           Never Ever call a boy to much sometimes dont talk to them for a while or let them call you (AKA avoid clingyness, boys HATE clingy girls)|`|gekVXz9eaa	U TOTALLY DESERVE BETTER LEAVE THT SUCKER!!!!!!!|`|cec710393d00151b1d2083c09840602baa	Hes a total jerk. Move on. He's only going to get worse.|`|KtLJMwDWaa	Ah, Iv been in this kind of situation before. (thought it was kinda different xD) But I can definitely help! I was in a relationship where, I felt to awkward around the guy. SO I broke up with him. He was very sensitive and he took extremely hard. He kept bothering me to get back together with him witch caused me A lot of stress, I started to fail one of my classes. So, I forgot about him and he eventually left my mind. <br>  SO my advice for you is to forget about him. Start hanging with a bunch of your friends until you completely forget about him. Life will move on. Also try to avoid him as much as possible!|`|jCykBGwlaa	OMG I had this freaking problem too!! I had to end it because of the basically same thing only we couldn't talk to each other at all it was forbidden. I lost the trust with my mother I had built over 15 years cause we snuck around and kept it a secret. My best friend told me not to trust him because he was still into another chick, I didn't listen to her and lost her friendship AND him. Turns out he was cheating on me with another girl already. I have felt serious pain because I didn't listen to my heart and best friend. You need to let him stay in the past because you could ruin the relationship with someone important in your life.
728ca39d4568214e7f3713844295c129aa	Waited until I finished undergrad, then married.  Worked on graduate degrees when married.  Personally speaking,  if one can wait it is much easier to finish schooling before marriage.  Why?  Marriage has responsibilities to not only oneself, but the partner as well with all the extra baggage.  Focusing on school for the first quarter of ones life, then marriage is the sensible thing to do yet it rarely ends up that way.|`|63e59b702150659952a33a58d86bde05aa	After college.<br>  <br>  Decided not to rush.  Although I was still very young when I got married (23 1/2).  Been happily married almost 22 years.  <br>  <br>  Marriage can last a long time - there is no need to rush.|`|Ag8pE3Cyaa	I was still in college when we got married. I had one semester left. He was in the army and about to be transfered 2000  miles away. We had to rush the marriage 1 year earlier than planned so I could be moved out there with him. I was 20, he was 28.|`|SHoGWZWPaa	No. I was older. My husband lived his his girlfriend from college but they broke up. It was mutual. I guess she wasn't the one.|`|jBigEy0Caa	Yes - Didn't want to wait.|`|AA12077420	Yes|`|cd8f30c22031713366cdb6b1bfaa4f5faa	no i didn't. I got to know my husband after i started working so i didn;t meet him in colleage
ahS6Jzbcaa	yer dats fine. i love a guy whos 21 n hes turning 22 in december dis year n i'm 16 turning 17 this year in june. we both love eachother so much. age dsnt matter. its only a number. yes when your younger it looks like a big age gap but really its actually not because wen u look at it wen ur 20n hes like 24-25 it dsnt look like an age difference at all, it just looks like a couple of numbers. if u n him both care about eachother n u both love eachother n u's know dat u's have a future together, then go for it, be together, why should u let other people tell u otherwise, u's both know wat ur relationship is like n if theres something there n that if there is a future, they should't tell u wat to do, it's up to u n him. I wish all the best of luck for you both.|`|6ydd9uIbaa	Yeah, I mean, I did when I was 15, but he was a completely different kind of guy. Unless you know he's almost completely innocent minded, I wouldn't. Also, there are certain laws for every state, so if you have sex with that person, it could be considered rape. But that depends on the state. <br>  But if you know that this person has good intentions (hah) then go for it.|`|qeNrGoMsaa	Nope. In our home it's a no-no.  All my children knew that. I say usually all they are looking for is Sex. I haven't been wrong yet.<br>  Plus depending on the laws in your country your parents or people who know, if you did have sex could have him arrested. Jail bait.<br>  Ask yourself this question why does he want to go out with a 15 year old, honestly???|`|TNjKwlA9aa	Age is a number of years that someone has been on the earth. People who say that they are all looking for sex is a stereotype. 4 years is not a big difference at all. I have been attracted to men almost 20 years older than me. Big whoop.|`|70fa36311c3ef00fdafac9a8ec42e6caaa	im 17 and my boyfriend is 23... :)<br>  my parents had a problem with the age difference at first, but it just depends on who you meet and how you feel with that person.<br>  if there is a connection, then age means nothing.|`|Zyy7isCeaa	In reality, no it's not, it's illegal. Until You become legal age you can't date people with a difference of 4 years. If they're not willing to wait for you then they aren't worth it.|`|AA12077420	age ain't nothing but a number.|`|HZVahqQ5aa	my g/f is 5 years older than me im 19 shes 24|`|s7UWLOS9aa	Not really. It's actually considered illegal. And if you guys had sex, even if you both wanted to, he would be charged with statutory rape, because you're a minor.|`|AA11447210	No. Fifteen is too young for one-on-one dating, and then should be reserved for guys still in high school (when dating age of 16 is reached). Not adults.<br>  <br>  One would have to wonder why an adult make would be interested in a girl that young, unless he figured she'd be easy to get into bed (younger people tend to be more easily maniuplated).|`|AA12262106	It depends on who you ask.<br>     The law says that a 15 year old is too young to be able to give consent for sexual relations. That means that having sex with a 15 year old is illegal and considered to be statutory rape.<br>     On the other hand, sexual issues aside, it's not uncommon for girls to be attracted to older males because women mature earlier than men. In that respect, it's normal for a girl to be attracted to someone of similar maturity level.|`|kpPt1c7uaa	yes...but don′t forget, his age ( 19yo ) permits many things...drinks, pubs,sex ( by eyes of the law ) traveling without parental consent etc etc ..and you are a " MINOR ".<br>  This relationship will be boring for him...pay attention.|`|Ot6EoFlpaa	I'd say yes, as long as you know what you're doing.<br>  <br>  And as long as your parents are aware of it.|`|tSI3GFepaa	age doesn't matter<br>  just becareful
vhiYsLjXaa	It is ok, but make sure she knows. Oh, be prepared if something goes wrong, because you could lose not only your boyfriend, but your friend too.|`|Wj7mBxFJaa	Harry Potter did it ;-)<br>  <br>  but seriously, sure as long as your friend doesn't mind|`|cTvP6j7Haa	Yes.<br>  Peace.|`|PkC1Sk8Qaa	Yes provided a few things.<br>  <br>  First give your friend notice before making any advances. Now I say 'notice' not permission because its not her place to tell you that you can't. However in order to keep your friendship it is best to tell her of your feelings and intentions beforehand.<br>  <br>  Second only pursue the brother if he isn't already in a relationship - this should go without saying. Otherwise if you steal the brother away form somebody he is already with you will make a name for yourself, but in a bad way.|`|6ozGEPdIaa	no.|`|xe3DPFbjaa	Sure as long as your close friend knows|`|yUiydPReaa	sure, keep ur friend out of it...|`|qiChP3Uxaa	Absolutely!!! Are you a close friend to my sister??? :)
O4VWnvVfaa	teased|`|H4GM9kWyaa	chased cause no one can catch me|`|SjrhuZQnaa	Chased|`|COc5U2nJaa	i would rather be chased, because it makes me feel good about myself and knowing that i have somewhat power.|`|k2hPH2rgaa	hell ya id rather be chased. i do the teasing baby!|`|7Fc22teCaa	The thrill of the chase.|`|dPgc8p9saa	chased!!! it makes me feel wanted!|`|G3fuWkPZaa	Listen, not to alarm you or anything but these kind of questions can be lethal to you and everyone else's health. Theres a new disease going around, its called new age cancer and its the big boy in these parts of town. This things stronger, faster, deadlier, creepier, and blacker than any other kind. This thing is so powerful, it can tear peoples heads off, eat lava, kill ronoson chirogodas, nexus rape people, and even turn into a dragon. Now nexus rape is an entirely new different type of rape altogether. Nexus rape is when the rape victim becomes the rapist and the rapist becomes the rape victim. Usually when this happens, a super ape infects the rape in progress, and gives the rape victim an overwhelming amount of strength. They are actually able to turn the tables on their opponent, and have been known to grow 90 feet. The thing i would be really worried about is ronoson chirogodas, literally living gods. If i could tell you all the stuff ive been through because of these things..... Ronoson Chirgodas once infected the town i was living in, killed the entire population including mice. Ronoson chirogodas can not be killed, they can only be stopped. These things are stronger than adrenaline fueled cheetahs, and have been known to create super fighting television speakers. Super fighting television speakers have been known to make someone explode, and creates extreme russian jihads. One thing you should really be careful about is super arthritis, this stuff can literally make you fall apart. Another thing to worry about is ultra alzheimers, which is like alzheimers except it affects everyone from every age. Ultra alzheimers once made a man forget how to breathe, and he died a painful death. He fell on the floor saying why? The thing you should really, really be afraid of is mexican ronoson chirogodas, even stronger than ronoson chirogodas. Mexican ronoson chirogodas carry guns, and travel faster than the speed of light. Usually they reproduce about 900 a minute and can infect the entire population in mere seconds. So if i were you id think twice before asking questions.|`|DV8AIpjFaa	chased!|`|EVDUAKPeaa	chased|`|qlUs8NgSaa	teased because they could try to kill me if chased
31ba1fdf2248aeb7170e0ccabf1bb8ccaa	HAHAHAHA - <br>  <br>  of course of course, the girl should pretend to be uninterested in her food and since the guy is paying she can only eat up to half of it and make sure the other half gets thrown away LMBO!!!<br>  <br>  and then she pretends to not be hungry and - <br>  <br>  *stomache growls*<br>  <br>  "Huuu, did your stomache growl just now?"<br>  <br>  "Ehh?? no, that was - uh, you know? - a fart."<br>  <br>  "Ahhh... - carry on."<br>  <br>  and she can only eat when he blinks or he turns the other way to ask the waiter something..<br>  <br>  these are the customs our forefathers have set before us.<br>  <br>  APRIL SHOWERS R THE BEST!!|`|1uRUaSblaa	Gee!

I send texts when I'm tipsy and then feel ashamed when i read the answers in the morning :p<br>  For me I guess it's all about saying the things you can't say when sober, even the stupidest things like ''I love broccoli'', haha. So yeah I don't really get it either but hey, what can I do? :)<br>  Cheers!|`|RJPJy3OKaa	After beers everyone wants to share something inside,<br>  they will behave what they actually are.<br>  Be kind towards them even they r humorous<br>  they could understant how u feel<br>  but they couldnt pretend|`|AA10461680	you are weird|`|AA11447210	I do not, although I've had friends do it to me. Drunk calling isn't a hobby of mine.
lgXSmCQRaa	No it is not normal. I think that you really need to have some counselling before embarking upon a sexual relationship, talk with a pastor or someone who is a professional. Do not put yourself through it anymore it could be damaging. I am sorry this has happened to you, God loves you.|`|Ka6PjecVaa	In your reaction there is still a traumatical component. Get in touch with a psychologist; he can help you.|`|cccd94bd44022461b89a461014ce4cdeaa	hay<br>  firstly I just want to say how sorry that u are going thru this, i no that it such an ordeal, <br>  <br>  personly comming from a person that was abused as a child and my first adult relationship was abusive. I no how difficult it is. My advice  woud be to seek counciling or if u can find some one that u trust to talk too. <br>  <br>  since u have told u boyfriend what happend try telling him what u need him to do to make u feel speacial in n out of the bedroom once u feel loved and secure then crying may stop!!!!<br>  <br>  God Bless u|`|2618b27ee1b1bc95bede9c4c3e930725aa	Have you told your bf you were abused? If not, you need to tell him, if you want him to fully understand. You don't have to do this alone, talk to a councilor or your gp, you need to deal with it to get past this, you can do it xxx|`|wyAbkG3oaa	After what you have been through, it is normal, and it must be difficult for you. You need to talk to him though. Just explain to him how you are feeling.|`|p0L0A4ysaa	If he loved you, he would understand and try to help you with this situation.<br>  <br>  I suggest you take a break from sex. You are mentally stressed.<br>  <br>  And if he loves you, he will accept that.|`|WlM1pkixaa	It is not wrong to cry after sex.  I have been married for 18 years and still do every once in a while.   I also was abused and know exactly what you are talking about.  Counseling does help!|`|8ZhtfqISaa	i cry when I want to have sex with someone but cant.. does that count?|`|XBy7am73aa	Firstly I would suggest seeing an counsellor if you havent already just to address ur issues, what happened to you will obviously affect you always, it is nothing you are going to forget.  Im not sure how old your bf is, or if he is old enough to be grown up enough to accept what you are trying to explain, I guess deep down he feels its something he is doing, but you have absolutely nothing to feel guilty about, you havent hurt him intentionally and you have every right to be sensitive to the issues.  I think most of us have cried after sex, myself included and not for any real reason other than an overwhelming sense of emotion.  I also think the reason you are feeling nothing is because in your mind you are shutting off, Ive been there too. Sex is meant to be relaxed and enjoyable but you both obviously have things on your mind. I wouldnt mention this to him and he wont understand and will take it personally but I can assure you everything you are feeling is entirely normal, emotions are powerful things. He needs to be more understanding but this will be reflected in his age, boys and men find women issues hard to cope with, men like problems to be solved just like that but yours cant be. If you go for counselloring take him with you, sometimes a third person can help. Neither of you need to feel bad or guilty, and if you love each other that much you'll work through it.  Alot of women will say men just satisfy themselves, but I should imagine he is thinking same as you so its more a mind over matter thing making it seem that way. My advice would be to have a break from sex to take the pressure off of both of you, and when you feel ready try it again in a couple of weeks and hopefully you'll both be more relaxed, sex can get very matter of fact, but refraining from it will make it better.  Hope that helps and dont worry hun Your normal x
8K3IucU3aa	isn't it great when you read question that don't have real words in it? anyway he might want you back. why does it matter anyway? do you want him back or something? he's a flirt and that's what flirts do.

5D4T6h7waa	Thats average for most young guys. if they get off before hand than they can last a little longer. it depends on the situation and the atmosphere. It always hurts at first, it will get better and so will you. :-) He was probably excited about taking your virginity.|`|TNjKwlA9aa	5 minutes is okay. I mean, he'll get tired at some point. Usually in a good relationship it lasts 30 minutes though. Try to take some control next time and don't just lay there.|`|AA10325474	5 minutes is ok.....repeat it the next time....wait some minutes after he came the first time and do it again, this time he will last longer....and again and again...and sex isnt just fuc.k.ing by the way....|`|Rmbwvm2uaa	5 minutes is pretty terrible.|`|9j2k2KeZaa	teenagers will just be teenagers|`|qbZrYbFUaa	Being nervous can hamper a guys performance, or he could have been very turned on by you just because of the build up. Also, not having sex (or solo-sex) for a while can speed things up. Trust me, sometimes you'll be praying for five minutes.|`|dAkjYoVraa	That's about average for males to ejaculate (or finish up). Practice, Practice, Practice and don't forget to use protection PLEASE! Feel free to talk about sex with your partner so he can know what you like and he'll know what you like.|`|YgbnvoVyaa	yo same here<br>  same situation i had like u<br>  hahahahah|`|AA11394554	I can't really relate to this sorry i have no idea i must have missed something . long are the days when i had sex for the first time but i had no pain no blood and i can assure you i wasn't just lying there so i don't understand how you feel 5 Min's is not normal no 3 is ha ha

JX0I6x1paa	You may be 20 (soon to be 21) but you sound very mature for your years so you must be feeling really frustrated with this level of control your mother is trying to exert over you.<br>  <br>  Tell your mother the more she tries to control your life the more you are going to want to pull away.  Tell her that under the law you have certain rights:  a right to make your own decisions and a right to privacy.  Tell her that, as she raised you to be an independent, free-thinking adult, she shouldn't be surprised that that's what you have become and it is way past time she let you spread your wings.  Tell her that you love her and respect her but you are also entitled to respect and it is high time she respected you and your wishes and let you have some freedom and, to that end, you will no longer provide her with information that you find intrusive.  She will be told what she needs to know, not what she wants to know.<br>  <br>  Go ahead and live your life.  You clearly have your own good boundaries and are capable of making sound decisions.  It's time your mother had boundaries too.  Set those boundaries and stick to them.|`|Y5pDh9ryaa	your mother is probably just trying to protect you. also when you said the rules become more ridiculous as you get older maybe because she sees that you  are becoming a responsible young adult and that makes her feel like you are not going to be around anymore and your right it sounds like she doesn't want you to grow up because it makes her sad to think that you are not her little girl anymore. i think you should talk to your mother (alone) and tell her how you feel and tell her that your turning 21 soon and you need to take control of your life. she probably will agrue with when you bring it up but she will soon realize that she can't always keep you from growning up. Good luck! i hope my advice helped you.|`|e09da30cdb337437977b3874bf55af82aa	You really need to get a place of your own.  You are an adult.  She cannot tell you how to run your life.  And if you let her you will regret it for the rest of yours.  You sound like a very intelligent girl.  Don't let your mom do this to you because it is wrong.|`|kWKZoQogaa	You're 21. You can do what you want, and your mother has no say in it. She can disapprove and ridicule you, but she can't stop you.|`|P4kXX0vBaa	definitely you have to do what YOU think is best, but you cant be disrespectful about it, remember your mom took care of you growing up, even if she doesnt understand you now, she is still your mom|`|pKzH1cFHaa	You are 20, she cannot control you. She cannot tell you that you cannot spend the night with, who you can and can't live with, keep your passwords, etc. Put your foot down and start being an adult.|`|gsfNJ00Jaa	Yea my parents felt the same way when I moved in with my boyfriend. But I am grown and they can't tell me what to do when they were having children before they were 20. I am 23 years old...still living with my boyfriend and not preggers or do I have any children. Some parents who were raised certain ways want their children to be raised the same way. I love living with my boyfriend because I get to see how he is before we get married.
Uj5kuzoJaa	He's just feeling insecure about what might be going on. Have you tried saying "hey I don't feel like hanging out tonight. Kind of need a night to myself. I'm gonna turn my phone off so no one can reach me." I'm sure that if you told him these things, he would be perfectly ok. And if he's not, then maybe he has some jealousy issues that you both need to talk about.|`|Rb087BsAaa	stop playing games and grow up.  it's pointless and will only lead to needless arguments.|`|uLHtXibRaa	He wants you to run after him. so..no..you are doing the right thing..i would just ignore the sarcastic childish comments..|`|b3c054cf8a809cd78b23404a2feecb7daa	He thinks you're trying to "play him at his own game". He hardly ever responds to your texts and doesn't take your calls sometimes, so he thinks you're now doing the same as payback.|`|Ey5ew3G6aa	you decided to do me??<br>  are you a hermaphrodite?|`|rnNGTYo9aa	YOU'RE DUMB !<br>  Of course he's going to loose interest in you. <br>  there is bunch of girls out there in the world (better looking than you ) that wont play silly games <br>  <br>  grow up!|`|LETd2hQwaa	Because there is a possibility that he is getting serious about you and his not answering the phone wasn't planned where you clearly intended on avoiding him. What you're doing with the whole unavailability thing is playing games and it doesn't look like he's into those games so I'd be careful cause it kinda sounded like 2 Can Play That Game. In all honesty, games don't work. Just be real.|`|ynFtyVKYaa	He means are chosing to be with him but have some dudes on the side (on the low that no one knows about)..Men will be men its human nature they want you tend to them when they need you..Some men will expect a lot out of you and others will accept your needs|`|AcjLKC2Laa	It means that your playing around by not answering when he calls you. If you really like him then you better leave your phone on or it's going too be over. & then you'll regret it, Trust me .|`|PA7kYyAxaa	These aren't even sentences. You're confusing a comma with a period.|`|6nIXYGu6aa	Hes afraid of losing you.  He is slightly loosing interest in you, but he reallllllllly doesn't want to loose you.|`|0WyFs0q0aa	??qNSHFSKLFDHGHGHGHGHGKJSFD|`|XEJD4mLWaa	He is probably insecure about himself. If you have already shown a lot of interest by texting and ringing him and suddenly stop he will think that you don't like him any more or you don't care about him. He will feel jealous (even though there is nothing to be jealous about). Just talk to him about how you feel with him not replying to your calls and texts and he should understand how you feel. One piece of advice from me is not to play around with people's feelings, sometimes it will make them very insecure and cause a lot of heartache, it's happened to me.|`|ib3SNK40aa	He likes you but you are distancing yourself from him. You are gonna push him away. He's going to start to think that you don't want to date him anymore, get bored, and move on. If you really like this guy I wouldn't turn my phone off like that again. You could at least answer the phone and say you don't feel like doing anything tonight. He will respect this way much more than you just ignoring him. And of course he will be suspicious about you turning it off. Wouldn't you? Another thing is that maybe he is not answering his calls now because you don't answer his.|`|mQOkElkeaa	He thinks that maybe you need to balance your relationship. I understand. dont always not answer his calls and it sounds like your saying he calls often maybe this is a little obsessive no efence or anything<br>  goodluck :)|`|3eBEYAhqaa	I think its a good thing!  I wish i had the strength to not jump to the phone when a certain guy calls.  Keep him on his toes but don't drive him away completely.
IPS3hWweaa	Don't date him if you value your friendship, ask yourself if its worth more than a potential date.<br>  <br>  Or if you value your new guy more than your friend, then you should date him. But if you do, be prepared to lose a friend.|`|IRtvIophaa	talk to your friend before hand and talk to her about you 2 hooking up and how'd she'd feel about it, but either i'd go with this guy especially if you like him as much as you say ask him if he has a friend to hook up with your friend that likes him that way she don't feel left out or anything.<br>  good luck!|`|RRr6WvlMaa	is she a close friend of yours? if she is ur best friend, i think u need to talk to her first to see her respond. make sure that she find out about this from u, not from other people....it will be better if u speak with her before u decide to go or not. But if u think that u can tell her later when u feel brave enough to do so, just be careful...I suggest u put ur position "just friend" first with him...I don't know.<br>  <br>  If I were u, and if she is my close friend, I will discuss about it first with her
3YIiDiBvaa	You'll be find if you cough dont listen to that. If its just you and him and you trust i him i think its a good idea because youll understand if you can control yourself around someone you trust. just be calm and remind yourself that your high thats what i do and it usually works it helps me think clearer.|`|jCykBGwlaa	Pot isn't the end of the world and you aren't going to die if you go ahead and try it with him. Relax and smoke a little if you don't like it then you never have to do it again! It's very simple. Oh and the coughing thing that's no prob just relax, the first time I smoked I didn't get very high just take a few drags not a whole lot that way you dont cough and you won't get caught! You might have fun!|`|mVxayJAhaa	If you don't want to, don't do it. Not even when your friends want you to, it's your decision after all.|`|uyv61IsLaa	well..... how old are you?I ask u because that plays a very important role<br>  if you are 11-14 you should not <br>  ifyou are 15-18 there is no problem<br>  (always in my opinion)|`|EYGcTxuCaa	Don't do it. <br>  It will ruin your life forever.<br>  You will be so screwed up and i would advise that you did not do it. <br>  your choice =]]|`|DW4oZcLJaa	Yeah, I regret it every time I think about it. Don't waste your time with it at all. There are much better things to do. It's not worth it at all.|`|48SlX2Yiaa	If you know you won't get addicted or don't care if you get caught, then do it.|`|ix1ONcHzaa	NO! DONT do it! if you want to ruin your life you'll do it!

If you dont get high ur 1st time you will just get a very minor headache.<br>  <br>  its ok if u cough because all the stoners do it depending on how big of hits they take.<br>  <br>  its just a casual substance like alcohol and its barely illegal and dont let anybody tell you otherwise. But its your decision you dont have to if you dont want to and i doubt i will force it upon you<br>  <br>  GL and have fun with it =D|`|fSbSD0B6aa	First off, it's OK if you cough. Secondly, you won't lose control of yourself like you would if you were drinking or something like that. It's weird, things just seems to slow down. If you're really worried about it, I would just try to control your inhales. Basically, the best way to get high is to inhale until you basically can't anymore and then hold it in as long as you can. I would recommend for you inhaling and holding it in for maybe at most a second or so and then letting it out.<br>  <br>  As far as your edit goes, getting high is, well, to sound cliche', a trip. It will be fun and I can guarantee for a fact that you will look back fondly on the experience. Pot just relaxes you ... it's hard to describe (maybe if only because I don't do it that frequently -- drug testing at my job), but being high on weed is a nice feeling that I'd definitely recommend.|`|mfr1TDeqaa	im so ******* sure he said your life is going to end. But its not like your vonerable when you get high, not like drinking, he cant take advantage of you or anything. also, it just makes you feel really good, and happy, and the first time i smoked i had a blast. just make sure your with someone you can have fun with. it also depends on what kind you are smoking, i wouldnt suggest smoking dro your first time, smoke swag. and if you cough it just gets you higher, it doesnt mean its all over, to prevent it , take little hits, like dont breathe in alot. youll still get high, but you wont cough , its fun, you should try it, it has no addatives in it so you cant get addicted, and there is no known physical cases of anyone dieng or over doesing so your in the clear.<br>  <br>  have an amazing time.|`|EJhYO9r6aa	Whether or not you decide to do it is up to you,, and I am decidedly neutral on the subject, but the main issue is this: Does your guy friend just want to share something he thinks is fun and interesting with you, or does he just not want to feel like a loser by being the only one smoking. That's my two cents at least...|`|w7sReKuLaa	haha well ok.. it will make you parinoid and burn your throat and i honestly dont know what to tell you about not coughing.. i think thats a give in... LOL but my advice would be to just hang out with him and not smoke... you'll find out its really not as fun as your thinking it is|`|mjfNfJZPaa	any one who would try to get you to smoke or do anything that could harm your body then don't do it it's just not worth it! www.xanga.com/LovemyMondayquotes|`|L6Dt7wo0aa	Pot is a gateway drug. Once you get the mind set that it's harmless you will start to see other drugs as less dangerous.|`|0cNEPquUaa	Come on, be Smart. Don't fall into peer pressure.<br>  Don't do it, unless you wanna ruin your life, cause then your gonna get <br>  addicted and all|`|xf9zCkHDaa	I have loadsa mates who smoke pot, Ive never had a drag of any cigarette in my life (Im 14) but its just cos when people ask me I just say naa Im okay taa and they dont mind they dont call you chicken or anything.

It really is just like that commercial. You never see anyone on pot in the street in the gutter but it really does stop you from doing what you would normally do if you didn't smoke weed.  It's hard to see it at first but years later, you'll look back and think......how come I didn't do this or that........it's because as soon as you got a break, you wanted to just chill and get high instead of pushing to do what you really should have done.  Don't do it.|`|c349355e8dbb5ddfa6d50324a51f78c8aa	lol it sucks, I wouldn't do it if I were you. But just doing it a few times isn't very bad I mean it's not like yer gonna get addicted to it or something. Yeah the first time you inhale it your gonna want to cough but DON'T. Just breathe the smoke out. If you inhale then cough then yeah your gonna suffocate lol it sucked because nobody told me.|`|6rvzeOsqaa	why try something if you know you aren't going to like it?<br>  <br>  here's the thing - your friend doesn't want to be the only one smoking pot, so that's why he's pressuring you to smoke it too.  he knows that smoking drugs of any kind is lame, and it will make him feel less guilty about it if you are doing it to.<br>  <br>  thats my opinion.  <br>  <br>  it's not worth it.  it just kills brain cells and your motivation.|`|sIX1nhCFaa	yer don't smoke again, its a bad habbit, i no it may sound good en all, but can't u say no next time? then u wont have to worry about smoking, ive never smoked of course, but i guess if u want to, then do it for yourself, not what other people say, and nah its not worth it.|`|vrcAP0yYaa	It won't ruin your life.

1xr6T6h0aa	In most states you are an "at will" employee.  Meaning, any hiring is presumed to be "at will"; that is, the employer is free to discharge individuals "for good cause, or bad cause, or no cause at all," and the employee is equally free to quit, strike, or otherwise cease work.<br>  <br>  A nice employer will give you severance pay of two weeks or more, plus your insurance.

Business (and life) is not always fair. The two weeks notice thing is just a courtesy, not a rule, anyway. I have seen people resign and their boss ask them to leave immediately. They are terminating people for a reason, and most of the time they want to cut the ties immediately. <br>  <br>  In some cases, they actually fire you then have security guards walk you to your desk to get your keys and coat, get your badge/keys and PC, adn walk you to the door.

zRI33zu2aa	Everyone's got their own style so it really depends on who you are kissing what will work well and what won't.  As everyone else said just try and relax and let it happen, DON'T force it or think about too hard while your attempting it.  I know that is easier said then done, when you are nervous.  But I'm assuming this will be happening with someone you care about and hopefully trust and I'm sure he will be understanding.  Anyway, along the lines of just relaxing I offer this advice: Make sure your breath is okay, ease into it and if it makes you feel more comfortable let him make the first move, go slow and tender at first so that you two can kind of feel each other out and get in sync, and start off caressing his lips with yours before gradually adding tongue. Beleive me you do not want to just jump in and shove your tongue in his mouth, no warning.  After the tongue is involved and you just explore each other's mouths kinda, see what he does.  There is usually some twirling together of the tongues, you could gently suck it, but definitley participate don't just let him do all the work.  Don't worry you will find your own style in time and your will do fine.  I was so nervous when I started kissing that I had a hard time enjoying it, but now I love it.|`|cR3nGvWiaa	Prepare yourself, make sure your lips look appealing and are soft cuz well who doesn't like soft lips! And stay away from foods that make your mouth stinky when you have a feeling that your first kiss could be on that very day. <br>  Just start out with a quick peck on the lips if your a bit nervous and shy. But if you aren't a tender/romantic one will totally put that special person on their knees begging for more. And keep this in mind, nobody is naturally a good kisser at first...It takes time and practice to become the best of the best. So don't feel bad if you think you weren't good enough for 'em! :D Hope this helped!|`|pxDowQ2laa	I Would Try And Be Sure That You And The Person You Want To Kiss Are Alone Together, This Will Avoid Embarrassment. Also where you are less likely to be interrupted by any family and friends. <br>  It is important to remember that your first kiss with a new person may not be as smooth or as romantic as you would have liked. <br>  When you are thinking of making the move to a first kiss make sure you regularly brush your teeth and have either mint lollies or chewing gum always handy to ensure your breath smells fresh and tastes fresh and inviting.<br>  If You're Nervous, Chances Are Your Love Interest is also nervous.

IdTenBtNaa	When she's at the beach, there are other people wearing the same thing as she is, so she probably doesn't feel that you'll be focusing on just her. But when it's just you two, it's completely different.|`|WyCmQBuvaa	If you walk around in your underwear, MOST men (i didn't say all), will think a girl is prancing around waiting for him to make his move and take her because why else would she be walking around in underwear as if she was a Victoria Secret model?<br>  <br>  A bathing suit doesn't say that.  It says show me the beach and a Pina Colada.|`|m3q6CIQMaa	i agree with u man 100%.  I'm 21 years old and I still do not understand woman. I don't know why they are weird like that.  But I will tell you this is maybe the reason why I turned gay.|`|AA11179568	she's just ashamed because she's changing clothes<br>  bikini is on the beach maybe the settings are different|`|ls8KNu9uaa	Does it matter if she doesn't want you to look?<br>  <br>  It is her preference and you should respect that..<br>  <br>  Or maybe you are really wondering why she isn't 'ON to you' hmm??|`|XgO9HUm9aa	Because underwear is made to wear under clothes and be covered. Some can be more reveling then bikinis.|`|GqsZigbXaa	bcuz a bra and underwear is more personal and tends to b kinda see thru|`|Ccpn6Zqeaa	caused she is not used to it and at the beach is just normal....its like taking a pee outside the house rather than inside|`|9FlUlbYXaa	Because underwear is not a swimsuit.  Girls are raised that way.|`|5zw5I6xTaa	idk i guess that's at the beach where there other people and other girls are wherein them loll

d5ae6eb71f3ea80a6ec89e0c5323f28aaa	Well. I'm not sure if weatehr you forgot to mention that he was wearing a condom? Because you should use it to be safe from unwanted pregancies and STD's.<br>  <br>  Okay. Did you know Precum contains 2% of sperm? And when he fully cums he only releases about 98% sperm. Precum is basically what washes out the other 2%.So there is a chance you could be pregnant. The best way to be safe is for him to wash his hands with soap and then finger you, because the sperm on his hands could have gotten you pregnant.<br>  <br>  Hmm...It is a lower pregnancy risk if your boyfriend came outside the vigina however it takes 1 mighty sperm to make a baby. Then again it's not a logic way to explain stuff...because Some women DONT get pregnant that easily and even with just a few times of cuming inside she still doesnt get pregnant - This is because either it's natural or that there is the calculation of when your last period is, your avergage length of period and then you can determine the days when you SHOULDNT have sex because youll be highly fertile where the chances are allot higher to get pregnant.<br>  <br>  If you feel you are pregnant then you should get a pregnancy test. Especially when you might start getting those preg signs of nausea, tiredness, no period...|`|O3TmYvl9aa	if there was *** mabe but normally u shouldn't worry i fhr didnt go in to far and i bet it was gd|`|l0oDymHYaa	Hi Dear<br>  <br>  You are playing Dangerous Games|`|ttT7W77gaa	ever heard of condoms?

DON'T DO IT!!!! You'll will aquire the "my little sister's friend" title! Be straight forward with him about your feelings and see what happens.

You're a vindictive b*tch who just wants to break up a couple just because you think you deserve him more because you're 'prettier' and 'going to be a model'. Maybe he goes on character more than looks. Beauty's only skin deep, which is pretty obvious in your case. <br>  <br>  Also, you said that at the moment you've 'befriended his sister, so it's all good'. Does this mean you're using her? wow, great friend you are. <br>  <br>  I can see why he doesn't want to be with you, and unless you plan on seriously changing your attitude to other people and realise that the world doesn't revolve around you, you have no chance. Deal with it.|`|GMA3pDCGaa	Give it to him for fre3e, if you are desperate; or, if you are extremely desperate, pay him (Trick him to think is some foto shooting for a model agency, by example).|`|ZpR57jbBaa	don'tchu have a bf already. remember he's "emo"|`|gAC4QY7gaa	Not being coincided.|`|BwxASAVtaa	I was quite amused by this.<br>  You cant Make someone like you..<br>  Unless youre like some professional Seductive person.<br>  <br>  And that would be Lust,<br>  Not love.<br>  <br>  If hes got a Girlfriend,<br>  back off.

There are millions of guy who will appreciate you more than him,  keep moving.|`|MeGehliuaa	Don't you f.u.cking dare break up their relationship, That is really messed up. Looks and popularity aren't everything, she prolly has a nicer, humble personality. Don't hate ont he negative feedback you're getting, you brought it on yourself. This is your Q to change.|`|z2QYSFlvaa	why do you want to take him away from his GF? there are more fish in the pond, you know???  don't get obsessed with him... if he doesn't fancy you,  maybe he doesn't feel a spark between you and him.. he might like you as a friend but that's all..  move on...

Oh, and she's not a stalker!|`|Jn4u6rEuaa	you can't|`|U4Y4lCNtaa	well, this isn't the answer you want to hear, but here it is. OK, so how do you know you will be a model? I thiink 99% of 12 year old's think that, or however old you are. And if he is already in a relationship, then he's taken for now. Wait until he's finished But trying to split them up will just **** things up. You will find everyone will turn on you thinking your a *****. The guy will hate you and you will have NO CHANCE. And the girl will hate you and it will be nasty. My advice, having been through the whole high school thing is to leave it be. But i can guarantee you the last thing you want to do is steal him. My advice would be to befriend him. And then, when he becomes single, make your move. But don't interfere with their relationship. Like, how would you feel if someone did that to you???<br>  <br>  Good luck anyway.<br>  <br>  <br>  After reading your replies... HOLY **** you sound like the rudest person on Earth. SO you think your hot??? But you sound and probably are a huge *****, and so self-centered. No guy likes that. I would rather someone with a NICE personality. Or even better, someone who is pretty, AND nice. Best of both worlds. And how do you know you will be a model? like 99.99% of girls your age think that. And besides, even if you were, what would that change? You could end up being a fat slob, someone the size of an elephant weith a ****** up face AND STILL be self-centered. OMG people like you will never learn. You just consider yourself and don't give a hint of thought for anyone else. That poor guy and girl you are trying to break up. What if you were that girl FFS???<br>  <br>  Have some insight into some one else. Anyone, sorry I was harsh, but it's probably just the truth. Good luck finding someone else.<br>  <br>  And hopefully you will learn something... by your mistakes!!!

e0dcce03a5934d3ac052cba2ba76fbb1aa	Hi there. <br>  First off acne is a portion of what goes on with adolesence and also hormone changes.   Its part and parcel of growing up.  Now I do know that Birth Control pills do help balance out the hormones but that too will take time. <br>   <br>  A little bit of make up and being who you are is the best policy<br>  Maybe you may wish to let him know about the acne situation.  <br>  Maybe he has the same problems as well. who knows.<br>  <br>  A little foundation will help but the marks are something that you may have to deal with no mater what   talk to a doctor as well he/she may have some ideas for you.  Dermatologist might be able to suggest some ideas on what you may need to do. <br>  Doctors are pretty good at giving a better answer.<br>  <br>  Respect yourself.    And just be as natural as possible<br>  understanding on both parties is a huge benefit.|`|PEVkrOVVaa	At night, put some toothpaste on all your pimples, it will dry them them up fast overnight.

Wi9nmYIEaa	wash the car yourself....naked  :  )|`|WewCtMpzaa	What's wrong with washing the car in the buff? Even if she is not hot looking, or even what most would expect to see naked, I think it would be cool to a wife washing the car naked... Kind of sounds suspicious because men like this kind of stuff in a voyeur kind of way, and more likely to embrace nudity than women. If she is really outside nude, I would not try to stop it.<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with a human body, particularly if its not being done for sexual reason, even in front of kids. There is an old saying that boobs never hurt anyone, in most cases they are pleasant to be around, except that we have so many backwards and religious freaks that expect to control society by making them hide themselves. The real power struggle is to keep people from being liberated, because once they are on that path, they don't believe so much, or will sin the first chance they, or anyone who sees them. This is crap...|`|1b5738a257bf0dcdcf42bd817a1e8692aa	Take away her car..<br>  <br>  What are you joking.  Even if this is true, are you some kind of control freak?  If she's doing it outside, then you must live in the boonies.  If she's doing it in the garage, who (besides you) cares.<br>  <br>  If she is indeed doing it outside, in the suburbs, she'll probably stop after she's been arrested a few times.<br>  <br>  Most women have a very negative body image, if your situation is true, you have a Diamond in the rough.  Try appreciating your wife, rather than criticizing.  You might find it gets you further with her.|`|AA11447210	If she's doing it in view of others (which I doubt, this sounds very bogus) then someone will likely report it. Public nudity isn't typically allowed (at least in the US).<br>  <br>  Otherwise, tell her to put on clothing. Surely if this were true, you could figure out how to handle it yourself...|`|TKNPveHDaa	Why in God's name would you want to do that?<br>  <br>  If only I could get my wife to start washing her car naked.|`|2x0jVI57aa	This is a business bonanza. <br>  Put up a sign in front "Car wash, $25"|`|eu4q4WbEaa	You should ask her why she is doing something like that in the first place...then sit down with her and tell her how you feel and that you do not want her to wash the car naked...but if you call the police the way some have said...then you would cause her to get angry and your relationship can start to have problems...|`|AA10461680	GO OUTSIDE AND HIDE AND TAKE PICTURES OF HER!!

JUG7cZkEaa	well sometimes its just better to leave things on their own. its great that u are thinking about it very practically. but u guys are just in teens so its very difficult to predict things from now on. just relax and do what's required of u...just dont over do things...dont give him any wrong expectations. be very true to yourself and him...if u are true, things will surely fall into places and both of u will be really happy together or with anyone else...what matters is to be happy!....so dont strain yourself so much....just relax and enjoy the great love and friendship u guys share!!!<br>  cheers!!!!|`|Bux5ciIQaa	its one of the frequent problems girls faces in the teens love, you can speak openheartedly to him what you actually mean the other guy, you can leave thing as it is but the love you are in right now is really true, then you can easily make him understand by showing more love than now and make your boy to feel that he is how much special to you., cheer up its all in love|`|HgB5xF9Jaa	omg i was kinda there! see....me and my bf been together for 1month and 3 weeks....i felt like he was OBSESSED WITH ME!i loved him n all...but things were kinda boring....but now i have found some ways to have fun!now,you dont HAVE to do any of them...and some depend....but it sounds like yall only see eachother at school...but idk...anyways try these tricks if you havent already:<br>  <br>  1.sex<br>  2.go more places together<br>  3.sexting<br>  4.be more grabby...hes yours,so "touch him in places that arouse him"...lmao<br>  5.lick behind his ear<br>  6.tell him you are kinda bored with the relationship and want to try something new,then ask HIM what he has in mind....HE WONT/CANT GET UPSET AT THAT BECAUSE THEN HE'LL W/E YOU WANT!<br>  but yeah just try the ones you havent,and if they dont work for you,it was worth a shot,kay?|`|POZvhqj4aa	tell him the truth how you feel

I truly believe that almost every little girls dream from about 6 and up is to be the belle of the ball. To be dressed up in a beautiful white wedding dress, to be as beautiful as one can be and to have everyone watch her come down that aisle on that day has to be the thoughts behind every man she dates, until she finds Mr. Right. It is the one time that without being conceited, they are truly the centre of everyone's attention. Even the story books are filled with the happy ending to a long wait. How can we think otherwise when it's been programed in us at such an early age.|`|3ab0562924ae58daee1fe664ccc36a9daa	I would be lying if i said i didn't think about it, but im honestly in no hurry to get married specially hearing all the married people talking about what they go through..lol. I have been with my boyfriend for four years and we have talked about marriage but i told him im completely content the way we are now, i said if we never get married it wouldn't break my heart, whats the hurry? Neither of us can finacially afford to get married any ways so no biggy.<br>   With most women or girls its something they dream of as little girls to grow up find prince charming if you will and get married and start a family together..its a female thing..lol.

Most guys are somewhat afraid of commitment therefore they do not think of marriage until they realize they can not live without someone.<br>  <br>  If you are asking because of a relationship you are in.  First you should consider how long you have been together.  A couple of years then, perfectly normal for a woman to start thinking of marriage.  If less than a year then your girl may be crazy and clingy.|`|ny94EXcGaa	Well... i did watch this interview on tv. it said that "every man has a plan" (meaning if he doesn't ever see the girl as possibly marrying, or just wants to have sex constantly) and you obviously don't see more than a girlfriend.. than you obviously arnt right together.|`|trxEyVRLaa	I don't :L It's silly - especially considering i'm 15 it's not like i'm going to get a boyfriend then stay with him for about 10 years then get married.

03ce03bb1a9fba2bd6ebcd6ed48ff8e4aa	You do two things: you have an ongoing disagreement about this issue OR you drop it and let it go.  In a relationship, you can, and may, have many things you don't see eye to eye about.  However, if it is something that can cause harm to the other party... than that is something else entirely. <br>  <br>  answer mine?  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090227125132AA4kTL3">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|NvQETTJKaa	i usually find it best to agree to disagree, then drop the subject|`|aGaqc3lnaa	you could just agree to disagree then drop the subject. help with my question?! 1st one on my page!|`|crw44vnRaa	If it's a trivial matter just agree to disagree and then drop it, if you try and convince the other their wrong it will just create a bigger argument.

3J7xX66waa	he is so hot, wants you to bite him, lol<br>  he loves ya so much,,|`|AA11447210	It's a sarcastic reaction to something the person disagrees with or was embarrassed by.

xKZTQ3Iyaa	Well i think is because some just hate for no reason and fighting is not the best way to solve it why all the drama for what even if its not worth it why waist time talking trash when your not gonna do anything just talk a lot of girls just cause problems for the hell of it but im sorry about your mom but it really isn't worth it especially if it's about something worthless.|`|qVzS6cV0aa	girls like starting drama, period.<br>  jealousy, sh*t talking and all that good stuff
jBigEy0Caa	Sounds like she threw a full fledged temper tantrum.  I would evaluate the situation and see if this is something YOU want to put up with.  Heck if this happened on the first date just imagine how your "real" fights might be like in the future.|`|NqMmvvgVaa	I'm not sure that she did it on purpose, she might just be a person who has a habit of pointing out things like that, or looks for flaws in people. It doesn't make her a bad person, but it may be one of the things about her that you need to get used to.|`|i1rDJY2aaa	You obviously did something that irritated her. Why didn't you ask her what she was upset about instead of telling her to "just get used to it"?<br>  That was very immature and controlling on your part!|`|wy5SiCS2aa	LOL. I would never do that on a first date, but I think you handled it beautifully. I've never had to "test" a guy like that. Be careful, she might be a control freak or become really naggy.|`|0ox8VKwKaa	You did the right thing. You are a man beyond your years. Men are from mars and women are from Venus.

XgO9HUm9aa	Hello,<br>  <br>  It seems to me that the reason he is doing this is because he does have feelings for you.<br>  <br>  He has probably had feelings for you for the whole 5 months you have known him. At first it was probably just attraction but now it might have developed into more of an obsession.<br>  <br>  He probably never wanted to be friends with you, he probably always wanted to date you but to avoid rejection he became friends with you because he thought that one of two things would happen.<br>  <br>  1) You would become friends and you would all the sudden become attracted to him.<br>  2) He would be your friend and get to know you better, and by developing that rapport with you he thought he could seduce you and make you fall for him.<br>  <br>  The reason he is texting less(Him having a gift for you all of the time narrows this down) is because he either read something, or someone told him that by texting you so often he is seeming too needy or desperate and by texting you less often it will make you want him because he is not as available to you.

Don't do it just to do it, just wait for it to happen. Stop expecting it too. It doesn't matter how old you are, it's actually more respectable to wait until you think it's right. The first kiss matters the most. <br>  <br>  Plus, if a guy (or girl.

Whether it's voluntary or not, it just means you haven't found the guy who will make the kiss worth it. I was 16 and I'm so glad my first kiss was with the guy it was. Not kissing a bunch of guys just to have been kissed made my first kiss special. It will happen one day, don't worry, and when it does you will probably be glad for it :)|`|kTBHGuL4aa	I would suggest dying you hair blonde, you'll become sexier (like me).<br>  <br>  And you've never been kissed?

rQ7dI88Maa	So what if she lies to her mom. Put yourself in her shoes. Her self esteem has to be quite low to lie and try to make herself look good.  If she felt good about herself, she wouldn't  have to fish for compliments. So don't worry if she tries to make you look bad. Most people know she will do that anyway. If you're satisfied and happy with you, don't allow her to bring you down. Don't allow it whatsoever! Ignore her.|`|OKrJrDF1aa	Ignore her, she doesn't matter in your life.<br>  If she lies for something serious, like a test if you cheated or something, keep a straight face and state a lie that everyone knows about that she did.Here's a conversation<br>  "Girl:She cheated on the test!

236548a8801617d43a073b2dd4d83f35aa	Ok...think about what you are saying.  <br>  <br>  How many sexual predators have you heard of that get on line and make young girls think that they are young and in love with them.  <br>  <br>  I would not trust my feelings for someone just because I chat with them online.  People can type anything and not mean a bit of it.  <br>  <br>  See..I love you, you are hot.  I just typed that and it means absolutely nothing.  Photos are easy to cut and past, so you do not even know that the picture you are seeing of this person is really him.  <br>  <br>  I know alot of relationships have started on the internet, but most of the time those people end up talking on the phone and eventually meeting.  I am not telling you to meet this person by no means, because you are very young.  <br>  <br>  I really do not have a direct answer for you, because it could go both ways.  Personally, I think you are too young to get involved with someone this much older than you.  Mainly because you seem a bit immature and naive.  Probably a really sweet girl who could be easily taken advantage of.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.

GnT2CnhBaa	ah i would say. obviously talk to her and just mention that your worried about whats going to happen between you two when you go to uni and college, ask her if she feels as strongly for you as you do for her. i think if you really love her and she really loves you just as much a long distance relationship could work out. its only a few years long distance if the uni and college arent THAT far apart maybe you could take little trips to see each other every now and again. also, just talk about what both your plans are for after you've finished studying where you want to go and where you think you'll be then. <br>  <br>  this is a while away tho. so id just mention it and have a small chat about it and then leave it, see how your relationship is a few months before it actually happens. <br>  <br>  my bf lives in a totally different country to me.. we have known each other for almost two years and we have been together for nine months so far. he came over and visited me last year for my birthday, i plan on taking a trip over to him at the end of this year. then FINALLY hopefully figuring something out long term. so dont doubt long distance relationship. if its a strong bond and you really love each other. cheating or anything along those lines wont even pop into your little head... trust me. =]|`|yxRGDjs2aa	Hey, isn't life so unfair and cruel sometimes!<br>  You meet somebody you really connect with and for 5 months you have a great time.

I would guess that your girl is probably feeling just the same as you, that's the first thing, so talk to her about your feelings, that will go some way to help.  Next look at it from her side, chances are you will be with other girls!  Next try to get something else in your life to take your mind of the situation, it's sad this has occurred but you have to think about what could eventually happen, so try and be mature about it.  You have both made you choices to go to different places so you new that you would see considerably less of each other and unless you have an inseparable bond, you know whta is likely to happen.<br>  I'm just trying to be honest with you.<br>  Hope this helps.<br>  UK Personal Trainer|`|2EprWAmIaa	if you love her that much, dont break up with her. many relationships are that are long distance work out great, talk to her about it. <br>  <br>  if she loves you back, she will probably agree
7e4jxj3Daa	Not particularly.|`|WVNMnvXLaa	id give you the answer but you probably wouldn't understand|`|tgYEXN8Gaa	Anybody with a pretty face, regardless of their hair colour, is pretty.|`|OJOt0Uyxaa	I think pretty girls are pretty regardless of their hair color so yeah...and no...maybe|`|f1f7IQIKaa	Yes.|`|WRIcZySSaa	DO you think the sky is blue?
37c233fdcf66a7d0f3a3f1d9528d7a4caa	Yes. This guy is trash.<br>  <br>  Your best friend shouldn't be ignorant to the trash she's dating. However, be careful when letting her know. She may not wanna hear it...|`|uRWhrmBPaa	Yes, you definitely should tell her. I am sure you really care about her and don't want her to get hurt. If she keeps dating him, she will get hurt. Carefully approach her and just tell her what happened. If she is truly your friend, she will believe you. If your friend believes you and you guys really wanna get revenge, go along with the whole thing, but when the time comes, send your friend to his house and shock the heck outta him. Just have her show up wherever he lives and dump him right then and there. By the way, don't EVER go near him. Hope I helped and good luck!|`|mBXu5G5saa	Of course! "To do it?" first of all the way he approached you was disrespectful so i would definately tell her and hopefully she gets rid of him for good.. ew!|`|AA11179568	yes<br>  unless you want to do it<br>  but if not really tell her|`|mDGt99Vdaa	well for on don't even go near this guy...and tell him that this girl is your best friend and you care about her and u wouldnt do something like to her...and that he shouldnt even be thinkin about doing something like that to her if he cared about her....and then yess go and tell your best friend because your her best friend your the one who is spose to look out for her when it comes to guyz u tell her who's a dud and who's a keeper....and u need to let her know what this guy is like...especially if u care about her...because if she gets hurt and you knew that u didnt say ne thing to prevent it and warn her wat he is like u will feel soo guilty...and what happens if it comes out later and she knew that u knew and u didnt tell her...it may cause an arguement and u may lose a friend....hope this helps :) p.s dont do ne thing with this guy|`|erXKJQ3Baa	Oh oh! You could be so evil with this.<br>  Tell your best friend, then plot.<br>  Agree to meet him, and really send your best friend to dump his ***.<br>  It'll be awesome.|`|mQg5SVQXaa	Don't tell he because it would hurt her.  Never say anything to someone to hurt them.  She will see how he is sooner than you think--with another girl, not you.|`|dPgc8p9saa	you should tell her!! no doubt about it!! you dont want her to find out on her own or catch him with another chick and watch her get hurt ya know!!|`|ULkqriEhaa	Tell her. This guy is a scum bag|`|49QkhjE7aa	tell her this guy is a scum bag|`|JmYvCpGFaa	the guy is a douche bag|`|fpS90nx4aa	yup you should tell her if she doesnt believe you then at least u can say u tried|`|PcRyxJ07aa	Yes you should tell her, even if it hurts her, she might love him, but why love a CHEATER?  id slap the boy silly if he did that to me. I hope this helps in some odd way!|`|7MnJUjo0aa	You really do need to tell her, and don't "do it" with him. That would make you just as bad as him, and hurt her just as much!|`|FmNtmhbAaa	First of all, you should tell HIM that he's a worthless lout who's about to cheat on his girlfriend! And tell him to grow a pair while he's at it. What a d-bag!|`|Ccpn6Zqeaa	you should meet him while your best friend is hiding behind you.. this kind of guy has no respect for both of you|`|EAlIwQxCaa	DOUCHE tell ur frend|`|igrdohopaa	Most def|`|WyCmQBuvaa	If you tell her, she will probably think you are lying and are just jealous of her and trying to break them up.  So have the cheating, lying guy waiting for you naked, and show up with your best friend and catch him red handed.  Bring pruning shears in case she wants to do an Elaine Bobbit.
RpMfrVb3aa	I am lucky that I am part of a loving family.|`|x1qKGmzSaa	well my family is weird.lol. we have a veryyy loving family, but yes we ridicule, judge, criticize and blame each other for things.lol i think its pretty normal for some families. haha<br>  <br>  :)|`|klq9rOjOaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  I'd say my family is loving, even when i get on their nerves. They support me if i'm saving money to buy something, or to plan for highschool, or college, or my job when I grow up.|`|YTN9yjKaaa	My family is probably a dysfunctional one.<br>  Althought they do support me when I need the support.|`|lPzZwlEJaa	I'm part of a loving family.

bYaxOfWOaa	Just tell him-<br>  <br>  Mate, you had your chance, you blew it, screw you, I can and and AM doing better. <br>  <br>  Sorry that he hurt you sweetie, but it'll keep happening. You need to end this NOW! Don't continue letting him think that it's acceptable to treat a nice girl like this.|`|Ky0ZxwkXaa	Well think about this, while you were thinking about Pato and actually kissed you also involving with another man ( cheating ) so think closely about your side.<br>  <br>  And believe if your BF fought to get you back that means he loves you and inside you , you love him too.<br>  <br>  because if you don't love him you won't be jealous on him.<br>  <br>  guys sometimes don't give their girlfriends attention to attract them more.<br>  <br>  Believe me if he fought to take you back he loves you and if you want to know that here is my recipe for you:<br>  <br>  Break up with him and tell him the reason why, then don't contact him or accept his contact for about 3 weeks to a month. See if he is hurting without you or not. Let him miss you and feel your value in his life. Then when you feel that he has changed go back to him and the relationship will be more healthy.<br>  <br>  P.S don't leave your man for Pato, you don't know him maybe he will turn out a cheater and bad as well.|`|za9b8cHKaa	Tell him that you feel the relationship is not working out. He will always have a special place in your heart, but it is time for the two of you to go your separate ways.<br>  <br>  Do not lie and say "let's just be friends", or "it's not you, it's me". Those things are annoying and he will know that you are lying. Also, I wouldn't tell him about Pato. That would just hurt his feelings.|`|ziUVXPbaaa	Tell him you don't appreciate him being affectionate to other girls infront of you and you don't think that this relationship is worth continuing...|`|XCag7QRTaa	lmfao going out with your boyfriends best mate can **** there friendship up n **** urs up n kno u as a slut rofl gronk|`|MQO55d1Haa	To be honest, there has been plenty of time when ive felt the same ive been with my boyf for 14 months and if you think patos the one then i say go for it you only have one life, live it how u want not how someone else wants you to live it, in my eyes once and cheat always a cheat :) hope this helps
AA10461680	yeah dont hug, haha wtf, <br>  dont get all creepy on her|`|vbq0tFRCaa	guys are famous for not reading/misreading signals, no offence,<br>  <br>  so you should just go talk to her, dont give her a hug...|`|qeNrGoMsaa	I would be very suspicious of you. I would ask myself what just happened. Why not ask her to the cafe and have lunch someday.<br>  Do you like her back or are you just going to "crush" her in the end?<br>  Don't lead her on if you don't have the intention of being more.|`|Z3DsL9Bqaa	put yourself out there then what you waiting for :-D, shes not going to reject you is she if she really likes you so what can possibly go wrong! i bet she'd love a hug off you, so why ask? it would make me slightly nervous if a boy that i dont really talk to but like alot asked for a hug, just give her one :-) start texting her and so fourth. get to know her and you never know. this is just the start enjoy yourself :-)<br>  <br>  good luck, hope it works out! x|`|236548a8801617d43a073b2dd4d83f35aa	You should definetly go talk to her.  <br>  Do not ask for a hug.  For some it would be creepy for some it may not be creepy.  Don't ruin what could be a good thing by asking for a hug.<br>  Get to know her better.  Go hang out.|`|MfzJROnJaa	I'd go mad and totally love it it'd be like heaven.. but id worry he was just taking the mick as he knew how i felt|`|d0TbPOeFaa	well, i think its sweet, but you could be getting the wrong idea, talk, and if you have alot in commen with her you could maybe go, what would you do if i hugged you? and if her reply is possitive then you should hug her, if the boy i liked came up to me and asked what i would do hugged you, i would be flatterd.<br>  good luck.<br>  x|`|Wsudxcybaa	depends on when you talk to her, if you are going to be seeing her for the rest of the day, it would be weird to ask for a hug right then, but if you guys are both leaving, go ahead! then again, you could just have something on your face that she was staring at, and she could turn you down flat.|`|FZ9a3dMnaa	Hell's yeah...hugs are the greatest...but in your case it might depend on the conversation.<br>  <br>  Maybe you could have other people that you hug around so you can just hug everyone so it's not heaps awkward or whatever. <br>  <br>  Better hope that you are right and she does like you...lol|`|ji8Q22xhaa	I think I would be over the moon after all the lad I fancy had 2 sides he sometimes talks and he sometimes doesn't. But then again I would think how long has it took you?|`|hy03VhVmaa	i would because i love hugs and even better if it was my crush!!!|`|2WYga1G3aa	Id hug him<br>  but perhaps it odd asking for a hug.
aVqfgQZkaa	You just answered it yourself--"If I'm not attracted to someone, 2 or 3 dates isn't going to change anything."  <br>  <br>  Attraction is important.  Don't try and compromise.  You'll only end up unhappy in the end.  Try opening up to different venues to meet women.  If you know what you want in a woman's personality, specifically, try and go somewhere you think that kind of woman would go.  By putting yourself in a position to meet a woman you like with the same interests, you're opening yourself up to more physical opportunities.<br>  <br>  It's great that you're trying to not seem shallow about the situation...but the way you feel isn't wrong at all.  Just try harder to meet a bigger variety of women.  Remember, the more opportunities you have, the more likely you are to find something you actually like without sacrificing the superficial or intellectual.|`|9FlUlbYXaa	Be friends with the ones you have things in common with.  Good looks are just that--good looks.  A few options would be dating out of your race, Internet dating, blind dates set up by friends, and getting involved in something you really love to meet someone who really loves the same thing...you'll see that person differently regardless of looks.  Have you seen "The Truth About Cats and Dogs"?|`|ctJsLe2Taa	just keep them as your really good friend i would want to say look at the inside beauty the heart is what matters blah blah but i understand you  looks are very important so i would keep looking but keep the girls that you have a good connection with as friends and maybe go for the averege kinda girls but know that the fuglys have a great personality because they have to make up for the unattractiveness lol <br>  good luck in the dating life|`|kTBHGuL4aa	Simple solution: Go to the Strip Club and pick up a women. You'll realize that strippers aren't all no-personality whores, they really have a personality, a mind, thoughts and opinions. Some are even intellectual. <br>  <br>  That way you won't have to stress about looks and focus more on the personality. After all, that's how I got my modeling career in Victoria Secret started.|`|1QSsOAAFaa	Personally, I don't think it's shallow to want looks AND personality. It's only shallow to want looks, but not care about personality. If anything, wanting both seems "deeper" to me. But I'm male, so maybe that's typical.|`|VnX9UR1Faa	if you can't kind someone you click with then that's not the right person. love wont come easy or fast you gotta work for it|`|QVj2JwWKaa	Definitely understand what you mean. Beauty is not everything, but if you can not look at the person you are in a relationship with and love their physical and outwardly beauty as well as their inner beauty the same, it wont be a relationship that will work.<br>  I kept on meeting the ugliest guys who had really great hearts and every time I would go on a date with them, Id ask myself what am I doing? This guy is so gross looking, I cant do this and I can't lead him on! <br>  I thought going on 2 or 3 dates would change my mind, and Id only see their inner beauty, but Nope, it didn't and wouldn't change my mind.<br>  And the cute guys who had only their looks to show and nothing that we could conversate on or build a relationship on.<br>  I think you just got to keep on looking, until you find someone who not only posses a beauty you can not get enough of looking at, but also of a beauty you can't stop thinking about,hearing her ideas and hearing her thoughts, and loving them!<br>  Give yourself some time!|`|wkMYDoDBaa	i think its natural to want looks. some people just might "settle" for a lesser attractive person because they themselves are less attractive.  but you still have attractive people dating  less attractive people. its all about preference and what people find attractive.|`|vMKEg29kaa	Hey Johnny ...<br>  <br>  Nice to meet you through here ... you have posted one great question indeed. <br>  <br>  In fact, this is not your own problem, many people (men specifically) share you this. They either fall for the appearance for the very first moments until they wake up disappointed or they come across some good girls who seem to look really ordinary but carrying flames of love and smartness inside. This really comes to show the right analysis that confirm that "Looks are great but not necessarily coming first".<br>  <br>  You should flow your gut feeling ... to love the beauty but to be more inclined to the beautiful mind. Be so sure that physical beauty fades away but the beautiful mind remains never aging ...|`|MPOHHTtAaa	you dont have to get past looks! I mean if you aren't 100% attracted to them now you wont be 20 years from now. Some people think there important some people dont. There are enough women in the world that if you are a decent guy you can have it both ways.|`|R6WHaxP2aa	Get over it! Are you a stud? A movie star? How would you feel if girls didn't want to date you because they didn't think you were hot enough? Only interesting.<br>  <br>  Never go for looks, they fade personality is forever|`|QBFbvO21aa	There are girls out there with both.<br>  Pretty girls arent that lame, <br>  Give it time and don't be too impatient.|`|9UQlhzitaa	you can't get past them m friend;but what you can to is grow beyond them.<br>  <br>  here is what i mean by that ;we are all changing all the time the outer beauty will change as much as the inner person will.<br>  <br>  this not something that will normally happen overnight but with time;with all of them that you like for either reason just enjoy there company and be a friend if you are going to fall for them it will happen in time.<br>  <br>  now yes if they are so unattractive to you that you are repulsed then;those you should move away from but other than that stick around you may end up with some great friends and you make grow to love them because of what you have learned with them.
I7V1GwS1aa	You're cute.<br>  Be more confident, get yourself noticed more. Maybe wear your hair out of your face and spiked up or something.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you have friends who are jerks right? and they get girls?<br>  A lot of girls will say, not it's not true we don't want jerks. But they date jerks. What really want is a jerk who has a side that's like you if that makes any sense. Which it probably doesn't because girls don't make since. haha|`|AA11441704	be good..........and go out and meet people.|`|DhwcHdfVaa	There probably is a girl who likes you, my crush has no idea whatsoever I like him|`|5PO7gDGRaa	Hello =]<br>  Im sure lots of girls will like you secretly but are to afraid to approach you. I find it hard to approach a shy person because the conversation doesn't flow which may lead the girl to think that your not interested or are bored. As long as you smile and listen to her when shes talking it should go smoothly. Even the nicest person in the world would have trouble getting a girlfriend, arrogant pricks usually find it very easy to get gfs but their relationships don't last long<br>  you are doing nothing wrong <br>  give it time <br>  Over and out.|`|ozPzqRlRaa	well i understand what yyou mean im saving sex till marrige too though my parents think im not a virgin dont ask why<br>  but anyways i hate questions lik this  know the answer just cant put it in words.<br>  i spose thi chicks ur aiming for need sex just dont want sex to be the reason they are dating u or u dating them.<br>  girls dont want to be treated like a **** but i spose they want sex|`|gCCAYkJUaa	Your cute, I'm sure you'll get a girl soon. :)

You may want to watch that my friend. Keep in mind that you should most likely not tell your family or friends about your unique sexuall activity.

m4T0IT0yaa	Honey, it's really simple.  Just do reverse psychology.  That's all.  Go the complete opposite.  Act like you do NOT even care.  Trust me...All of a sudden you'll get, "Hey, why aren't you saying you love me any more??"  or "Hey, why don't you want to talk to me for very long?"  Just pull back and the man will chase.  You're smothering him right now and when a man is smothered, he retreats and will give you the exact opposite of what you're looking for now.  But once you turn the tables and act like you don't care...he'll resume the chase.  Trust me!|`|0de60a89e9f7e2a8a9c90ff78512aa34aa	Girl he is a guy. He does need time to be with his friends. You need to start putting your self first and not be so available for him all the time. You have to make him want you. Being to clingly guys do not like. Even if it bothers you try not to tell him or show him. Go out with your girls find a hobby to do.  Give him space and things will change.|`|RqzifyEaaa	I'm also in a long distance relationship. I feel at times my self being clingy. All I think about is him and what he's doing wondering if......I believe a person needs to stay focused. Do the things that make you happy and learn to be trusting, even if you're not. Keep telling your self that he loves you and only you and things will work out. Instead of worrying go out and enjoy life and have a good time. Most of all Smile.|`|dpCsTIEIaa	Go hang out with your friends...enjoy yourself. You don't need to cooped up in a room either. It does get a bit boring just sitting at the computer. I imagine once you get there he'll hang out with you more.|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	You need to pick yourself up. Do something that makes you happy. What do you like? What makes you feel confident? Buy yourself something nice. You are worrying so much about this guy, that you forgot how to worry about you. If you are happy with who you are, if you feel confident, he will be happier with you.<br>  Surround yourself with people that make you happy, funny people, people who treat you nice. Hang out with them when he isn't around. Don't sit around your room waiting for the phone to ring. <br>  The less dependent you become on him the less clingy you will be. And in return you will be a lot happier if you focus more on you, and doing things for yourself.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!

Its better than being ignored, but if you really can't stand it no longer, then you have to tell him the truth.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should catch him when he is in a really good mood, perhaps sweeten him with a cup of tea or something and tell him exactly how you feel. Don't forget to tell him that you still love him, though.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Tell him he's a creep.|`|rIOD8tgvaa	Gee, Sora..Dad's treat their daughters differently than their sons.  Dad's are annoying when you are 14.  You are OK and so is your Dad.  He loves you and was put in your life for a reason.  He can do a good job as a parent or a bad job.  Just face the fact that you are in a loving family.  It's tough growing up but, this is just part of it.  Give your Dad a hug.  Love is a great thing.|`|ygGr1nX7aa	You'll probably just have to deal with it, I'm afraid.  Once you hit the teenage years, it's a biological fact that your parents annoy the hell out of you sometimes, no matter who you are.

Have you tried having a really serious conversation about it, instead of just getting upset?  Sit him down and tell him how annoying you think he his for thinking your beautiful.  In fact, just let him read this.  I think you will get the point RIGHT across.

We jumped in his car and headed to his apartment for a couple of drinks and by the time it was time to hit the club all my co-workers were passed out. Next minute my boss and I had a brill idea to put a "Bom Chika Wah Wah" movie on and yeah... I think you know the rest.<br>  <br>  Anyway I remember waking up on the balcony with the sun shining down on me, completely naked, my boss dribbling on my shoulder, a video camera on the table and the tenant in the apartment across from us staring with a big grin on his face.<br>  <br>  If that wasn't bad enough!

Just say they look immature when they use those words. Or, if you don't feel comfortable doing that, just tell your teacher that a lot of kids are swearing and it bothers you. The same things happened to me when I was your age. They were friends of mine so they listened to me and stopped. But telling your teacher would work too. They might contact their parents and tell them what's going on. I understand, it's super annoying.|`|8TdZhMnWaa	slap them everytime they cuss|`|L2Tvu7VLaa	Tell them that it bothers you to hear those words all the time and that it's hard for you to follow what they are saying when they cuss so often. Tell them that because of these reasons if they can't control their cussing around you then you won't be able to hang out with them. And then remember that it is up to them weather they want to stop or not. if they don't then simply find other people to hang out with so you don't have to hear it anymore. You can't control what they say you can only let them know what bothers you and hope that they respect that.|`|OKrJrDF1aa	Tell them they're NOT cool.

AA11925968	1) Paris Hilton is amazing<br>  2) Compliment her like tell her you like her shirt or something but don't overdo it b/c that would be weird.<br>  Ask her how her weekend was, if your in a class with her, talk about the class or something, ask her if she did an assignment.<br>  The thing is to work on your friendship with her, it might be hard but try to pretend that she's just another one of your friends. Once you are more comfortable around her, try asking her out--the worst she can say is 'no,' and at least you'll know how she feels and you can work on getting over her. If your too shy to talk to her sometimes, what I find helpful is bring a neutral friend along to help ease up the tension and once you guys are comfortable talking your neutral friend can leave 'to use the restroom' or something<br>  xoxo|`|Ey5ew3G6aa	you need to be friends with her first..<br>  then be funny and make jokes in front of her..<br>  think of what a girl looks for in a guy and be that!!<br>  good luck!!|`|woL3VYzOaa	ask her about her weekend, or like how she thought of a test (if ur in her classes) or something that you know interests her.|`|ed77b684631a15604ec6d6ba1f0a55daaa	Play it cool, target what she likes, ask her about herself, let her talk, show her you're listening. Don't take anything too fast, there's still loads of time for you. If she's perfect do you really want her now?<br>  <br>  Just play it one step at a time, on msn when you chat maybe slip in a little more, flirt delicately, don't go all out. Subtle. Maybe bring up something you talked about on msn in school.<br>  <br>  Just play it nice, be the nice guy, but have that other mysterious side too, just so she's intrigued.

What was the homework, how's it going, what are you doing on the weekend. Be relaxed and confidence so you don't stutter. <br>  <br>  If it's possible, put your hand on her shoulder.

HERE'S MY ANSWER:<br>   Ask her what her favorite class is, when she answers say, "me too." on msn ask her if she wants to sit with you at lunch. if she says no then say "ok" if she says yes then say " meet me at the cafeteria door right before lunch" it gives you a chance to walk with her and people will see you together and assume that she likes you. Talk to her about something you know she likes. If shes in sports ask her when her next game/meet is. Talking is key. Make her laugh. that helps A Lot. GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!!<br>  =]|`|1be4nJuOaa	holly Jesus!<br>  <br>  <br>  Here's the plan buddy, your a badass. In middle school its all about appearing to be the coolest guy around, no one cares about how you look or who you hang with. Its all about the "word around". You need to sell yourself, get your word out there. Talk to a few of her friends, find out what she likes. Flowers, chocolate, whatever. This will cause a social reaction, all of her friends will relay your conversations back to her, even if you tell them to Not tell the girl. Wait a while, work it, be mysterious. If people ask you if your "sexually experienced" say hell yes. Tell them rumors about ex-girlfriends. It seems quirky, but remember its all about the word around. It may not seem like the right moment (afterall, what moment is) but then you have to make your move. Ask her about her relationships, try to give her some advice. Tell her if she wants, she can call you to listen to your advice. Soon enough you'll be talking to her every night, getting closer and closer to her, and what better way to be mysterious than through the phone? no image. just a voice. From there your relationship should work out. But remember, don't sacrifice. Show her your the best thing for her, but always put yourself before the girl.|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	13?

I can only feel sorry for this poor baby and I feel sorry for your ignorance.|`|AA11349925	The best thing you can do is let this go and look after yourself.

Yes, you may eventually get a call back from a woman, if you have Brad Pitt's looks (or money), but do you really want to date women whom you know nothing about at all (other than what they drive, and how they look)?

If this is the desire of my better half, I will respect and obey him as what we vowed on our wedding day.<br>  <br>  The truth about marriages is, it doesn't just involve 1 person. It's a unity of the families as well. That's why they are called "in-laws". In the sight of the law, they're now related and considered a family.<br>  <br>  Therefore, before committing to one another in marriage, be sure to discuss about the immediate families as well.|`|O3EtP4vOaa	What is the dilema?  Getting married? If you do not want to get married than dont if youlove him and want to get married then get married.  Living with the family? This is a separate issue.  If it is to save money and then move then sure why not if it is a permanent living arrangement and you are paying rent and you do like like being so close to the fam then tell him NO.  I personally would not live w/ my in-laws for any reason, but we did live with my sister and her husband for 6 mths when we moved from another state and were awaiting our house to be built.

God I dont miss high school for a second!!|`|sLl8W319aa	maybe shes just feeling empathy. like if she were in the other girls position she wouldn't want you to ignore her<br>  <br>  ...or mabye she is testing you.<br>  <br>  mabye you should ask her...then again since you know her better than me it wouldnt bee good to take me advice (on the ask her part).|`|jxbNUjuWaa	oh yeah she's definitely testing you. I do the same thing with my boyfriend lol.|`|BW1Hlfrkaa	she wants to test you and probably a little jealous too.|`|FMWrcL4Waa	Shes probably just trying to show you that she trusts you and isnt going to be jealous (like some gf's are) if you do so much as talk to another girl.  I dont think its a test, but you know her, so only you could really even have a clue if it is or not.  I think your lucky though!!!

I find my husband isn't really good a reading my mind, just come straight out and tell him what you want but don't put him down or say you never do this or that when you tell him. Be kind and encouraging. Say things like " I like it when you... " " it feels good when you..."|`|iblT1HJpaa	hummmmm......<br>  for most guys, all you have to do is breathe...........|`|36PrVK7Oaa	If you radically change your appearance, e.g. hair style, hair color, different makeup, clothes, in other words make yourself look like a different woman, it will trigger a subconcious reaction in a man's mind that a new woman is available for mating and his sexual interest in you will be renewed.<br>  *<br>  Be frugal with money because nothing kills sex drive in a man more than financial problems. On the same note, when a man has success at work or obtains a sum of money, he will want sex more.<br>  *<br>  You can also start watching some p0rn and that will get his attention.

Don't you see that by getting a positive reaction from you, he will always expect you to cuddle at the end of the day, no matter how bad a fight you have?

wck4MHREaa	How hot is she?<br>  <br>  No, wait, that's bad.

I hope I got that correct. Now the question.<br>  <br>  Would I hook up with a girl that my friend has been talking to? In his own house? In his presence? <br>  <br>  If M2 did that to M1, I don't see how M2 was really friends with M1 to begin with. I'd NEVER, and I cannot stress that enough do that to a friend. Granted M1 probably should have been more aggressive towards that girl prior to this event as it seems he likes her, and wants to go out. It still doesn't excuse the behavior of M2. <br>  <br>  I'd say M2 is a douchebag, and a sh!tty friend to begin with. Who cares only about getting *** at the expense of others even his friends. I'd call him out, and probably wouldn't want anything to do with him considering the circumstance. <br>  <br>  Than again, it's not like he forced the girl to do anything she didn't want to do, so maybe the girl just isn't that into M1, and just wants to be friends with him, and was more into M2. I don't know, and I cannot really say for certain.<br>  <br>  If the girl still wants to see M1, than I have no idea what your definition of "seeing" is. To me seeing is basically talking, maybe have fooled around but nothing serious, as to warrant not seeing others. But to do that to M1 is wrong, and I'd put both the girl and M2 at fault. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps, and makes sense.|`|mhxi84xtaa	Im lost sorry
iWLdlWthaa	ohhh you know whats 10x better than giving a male a kick between the legs? giving a chick a kick between her legs. You see, everyone feels bad for guys when they get kicked, and everyone knows its supposed to hurt. Besides, they often wear baggy clothing and may see it coming.<br>  <br>  Girls wear much tighter clothing and less underneath, AND they expect it less. There was this girl who was always kicking my male friends in the crotch, and I had enough. So, I slapped on my pointed toe flats and waited for a day for her to be wearing the tightest thing possible. Finally, she wore these athlest shorts that were REALLY tight (something like this <a href="http://www.best-volleyball-equipment.com/images/low-rise-volleyball-shorts-calvin-klein-365-cotton-seamless-boyshorts.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.best-volleyball-equipment.com...</a> ) and after school I jammed my foot right up into her crotch so hard. She fell to the ground clutching at her crotch for like 10 minutes.<br>  <br>  It felt REALLY good. I'll do it again if anyone pushes me to !<br>  <br>  haha Im so evil :)|`|1ZDdUP4taa	Yes.<br>  <br>  I'm a guy, and we all know that's a no-no when we fight, but I'm not the biggest or the strongest.  A guy a LOT bigger than me punched me for no reason when I walked out of a nightclub with some friends, I turned, saw how big he was, and just kicked him square in the nuts with my cowboy boots before he could punch me again.<br>  <br>  We pulled out of the parking lot before the cops got there, or he could get up.
FLAtdWrmaa	Fresh flowers, fresh wildflowers, potted plants.<br>  <br>  A warm, funky felt hat, with or without a sparkly/colourful/vintage brooch to pin onto it.  Or a knitted hat & scarf set in her favourite colours (they make these in some really wild yarns).<br>  <br>  A board or card game, if she'd like playing it with you and/or her friends.<br>  <br>  Accessories for things she already has -- a memory stick for her computer, another memory card for her camera, a new addition to a collection of hers, display methods for her collectibles or her art (I'm thinking things like frames, spoon-racks, bell jars, carved pedestals,...) etc.<br>  <br>  Something hand-made by you, if you are the least bit arty or crafty.  Maybe take a half-day class at a local shop (bead, craft, sewing) and make her gift in the class (tell the instructor, they often are happy to help).  Hand-made jewelry goes over well with many people.<br>  <br>  Just a few ideas.

She can love him but love her God more and if she is more needed to help those in her family and country then she can't not think of her own personal needs and desires .. Many have scarified their personal feeling for those whom need her more .. Her country is her life .. her ppl are her life .. She will miss her  home dearly ..

qIEhu6uxaa	don't wear lip gloss.  chapstick is okay, but the sticky stuff is gross.  kiss slowly but surely...in other words, don't move too fast but move at a pace you're comfortable with-- which will hopefully be faster than too slow.  don't exacerbate your tongue.  no fast movements with it, be slow with it.  don't jab or poke it in.  open your mouth just a little bit so if he wants to stick his tongue in he can and then that will be the cue to allow you to do the same.  basically just go at the rate you're comfortable with.  it's easier than you'd think :).|`|loQcRnlXaa	So its your first time going out with this boy and your already expecting the kiss?

Then when you guys become like great friends, he'll either ask you out, or if you wan't to ask him out then you should..<br>  <br>  Go ask a friend you can trust to ask him for you, and then if he says no and goes to you and be like ".. I heard you sorta like me.." You could be like "What are you talking about?" He would be like.. "Your friend just asked me out for you.." Then you could be like.. "Oh my gosh, she is totally in trouble."<br>  <br>  I hope I helped, good luck!!|`|NSx8YmP6aa	Maybe he's just trying to be nice to you and theres no way to avoid rejection.

You can always write a little note on the bathroom mirror in lipstick; leave a little note with a Hershey kiss on his pillow; make HIS favorite dinner; it doesn't take a whole lot to let him know you love him and care about him. Of course everyone seems to have sex on mind; but that to me seems a little obsessive and expected. Just do something for him that he normally does, like take his car to get it cleaned or anything.

nk3QCoPvaa	Hey, when you fall in love, you fall in love. <br>  <br>  However, there are some things to consider. First off, something is really messed up if you can't tell your parents about it. Consider that.<br>  <br>  Next, you guys are both relatively young and healthy now, so things are fine. But look at it in say twenty years. You will still be younger than he is now (38) and he will be pushing 70. Do you really want to be coming home to a seventy year old man when you are sexy and young and pretty? Think hard about that.<br>  <br>  Finally, there is the issue of kids. He has already done it. If you want to begin that cycle of life, he may not be on the same page as you. He may not want to go back to diapers and 3:00 a.m. feedings and kindergarten parent/teacher conferences. All things you will want to do, and all things you will enjoy much, much more with a man who is more your age, and is as engaged in all that as much as you are.<br>  <br>  One last thing - his kids. Imagine if your dad and mom split up and your day hooked up with a twenty year old girl. How would you feel about her? Would you really want to have to deal with all that resentment at every Christmas and Easter and Birthday and Wedding and Funeral for the rest of your life? <br>  <br>  Think about it.|`|AIskV0efaa	good luck weith that|`|89b7405201feaf6d3fdb7bfe0c1d09a9aa	Your only 2 years older than his kids? ewwwww.|`|7Fc22teCaa	If my daughter approached me with something like this, i would tell her one thing, and that is age gap sucks!!! The beginning phase where you are now with this man is all new and exciting for you, it is also attractive to you which tends to shadow the instincts of doubt.<br>  Doubt, being the inner voice of wisdom directing you past this, and carrying you into your future goals in life..your life!!!|`|MPOHHTtAaa	Well because your 18 I think you should gaurd your heart with your life from anyone, weather it be an older man a young thug etc. etc. etc. You should just be careful that you don't invest your entire self into a relationship that may or may not work out. And yes your parents might be freaked out but like I pointed out, dating some young skater kid or thug that can't support you or will drag you down and get you in trouble isn't good either. Good luck though, just always put yourself first! Try to live YOUR life and not his! I did this a few times, more than a few times really. I became just like whoever I was with and lived there life, I don't do it anymore and I am happier.|`|X4Owk0xTaa	Older guys are much more experienced and really know how to woo a lady. So make sure hes not just using you to pass time, make sure you are not his toy. If you really really really do love him, then by all means take that risk. But you're so young, and think of the future ahead of you. When you're 28, he'll be 53. When you're 48, he'll be almost 80 years old or something like that. If you're prepared to deal with the age difference, sure take a risk at pursuing happiness. But at this stage, you're only 18 and most likely you're not sure what you want. Perhaps his attention is very flattering but give yourself a chance to explore the world out there before jumping in with a man who's lived half of his life already. You're so young!|`|lnhPL7jaaa	Follow your heart but be careful, in most parents lives, their children will always come first. Try everything once, but be mindful to not hurt people around you (family, friends) in the process. Also think about the long term aspects such as becoming his wife, your probably wanting to start a family of your own one day and having children to him might not be the best situation with him already having a family, but don't take things too seriously at the time, if you are enjoying yourself and having fun why give that up just because of society's expectations? Good Luck With Everything. I truly hope that you do make the best decision for yourself.|`|t3G5xSbIaa	lsn if ya really have this huge connection then nothing  can be strong enough to break that ok this might be a big step and a berrier along the road but u have to learn to jump over that there will be lots that u just gotta come around i know it might be crazy but fallow ur heart maybe he might be the guy u can't just  let him slip through ur handz... but on the other hand i don't think it would be apporpriate, u guys can always be friends and have fun but not sure if this is going to suceed. u have to talk to ur parents hun|`|msOABQbSaa	If it's love then its ok, but like the other person said, if it turns out to be for the wrong reasons things could get bad.  Good luck to you, it sounds like you have found the perfect person.|`|89aSCfaAaa	You and your question seems to be sweet.I has heard these type of stories many times and i always go with love.I think love needs no age and you can continue with your love if you like.|`|Lmle1xpgaa	Its ok. as long you love each other and you're ready for any consequences that may result to your decision.|`|d31ed3f0603bc71c951f2f6613a93690aa	where is the madre of his two children?<br>  <br>  you better not be the girl he is having an affair with|`|JZP4Wmtzaa	Ew.

I myself is falling in love with a man who is 7 years older than me and he's very caring. Maybe older men seem to care more. Girl, you seem very connected to this man. You should talk to him about this discussion like you are into him but what does he think about the age difference because sometimes, things can't work out because of age difference and etc. He seems very understanding so have a talk with him.<br>  Well,when you are in love, you don't care about age difference since love blinds you. If he's really good to you and you'll get more mature as an advantage of the age difference,your parents will understand one day. But the most important thing is make sure of what you feel and expect some tough times. This kind of relationship is never easy. There will be some very different opinions from your parents' side, his children and relatives' side. Anyhow, I hope this helps. Good Luck!|`|9gEwekReaa	I believe some older men much younger women relationships can work. Yet this is a HUGE difference in age. Your just starting life, he has already experienced so much, you two are on two completely different levels. Your energy level will be so much higher, and he may be ready to settle down and relax, this is something to consider. What about likes and dislikes music.... hobbies... etc...etc... So much to consider. There is always the fact to he may be using you. Think about things; discuss much. Let youre common sense guide you.|`|CRDl9nffaa	I had a relationship with a 40 year old man when I was 18 (long time ago!). It lasted two years and it broke up for quite normal relationship type reasons, not because of age difference. My only problem with age difference was the discomfort of some of my family and friends. <br>  <br>  My parents were uncomfortable with it for about the whole of the first year. <br>  <br>  But my mother kept fairly quiet about her discomfort and tried (mostly!) to be supportive. She said it would all be fine as long as I treated it like any other relationship, expecting no more and no less than I would from anyone of any age. <br>  <br>  Looking back this was very good advice, though at the time I remember being less than graceful in the way I received it. Sorry, mum:)<br>  <br>  Age difference is a factor in relationships that can can act for better or worse (or both, at different times) and you need to keep your eyes open to that, which it sounds like you do. But it's only one factor among many, such as shared interests or outlook, liking each other's friends, compatible sense of humour etc.<br>  <br>  My advice - never, ever walk away from a relationship that's working and feels good. But be scrupulously honest and always have your feelings, anxieities and worries out in the open with each other. Including all the ones you've mentioned. If you can't do that with your partner then your relationship is shaky, whatever your ages.<br>  <br>  Best of luck. And if people wrinkle their noses, be generous and smile. They can't help themselves.|`|E6Cd4dyPaa	wow that is such a love story! i think that is extremely sweet. but you looking at reality is a good idea. Yes love can make you do weird things even go with someone much older. you can either 1.) follow your heart and if you do that lets look 12 years into the future, you will be 30 and Joe will be 55. and Joe's kids will be about 28 or so. You will be seriously by then in your job, whereas Joe will almost be retired. it will cause alot of problems for you and him and may resolve in fighting in the future. or you can look at option 2, being with the man you love and spending a wonderfull life together. What about option 3..kids, do you want them? does Joe was a 3rd child? if so think more about that. and lastly option 4 your parents. im not sure how they will react, you can only hope that they would support you. If my child was in your situation i would support her but also be abit confused. There are of course more men out there who are perfect for you but you want Joe. so there you have it, the basic options that you should think about, i wish you the best of luck in the future with your life and i hope you and Joe have a great day!<br>  remeber its your life and your decision! as long as you are happy!!|`|VvELhBAvaa	Follow your heart. There's no guarantees with love. Sure, the odds of it not working out are high. But then again, you can't put an age limit on love. Maybe it is just a number. On a more serious note, I think you need to discuss your feelings with him. Does he feel eqully for you?|`|ba20D3w7aa	Girl do it! If anything it will be a life experiance that you can only learn from. If you have yet to have sex period I would suggest re thinking it because it most likely will go down but if anything you will see a little bit how life works. Test it out and tell me what happens!|`|fpS90nx4aa	wow thats a big age difference i was thnking of answering this question "age aint nothing but a number" but i think i changed my mind..well if you say you know him well enough to know he isnt a perv then maybe its ok.just be sure he isnt using you for arm candy.in the end its all up to you but you have to admit theres def something wrong with a 43 yr old man picking up on an 18 yr old high school graduate.in all honesty its all up to you whether to go on this trip or not just be safe and take care of yourself.best of luck|`|qbZrYbFUaa	The age gap may not seem like much now in the "honeymoon" phase of your relationship but when you get older and further into the non-physical parts of your relationship, you'll probably find that you don't have enough in common to relate without the happy feelings and intimacy. Also, if his children get jealous, they will probably take precedent and it could create tension. I think spending break with him would be a great way to test the waters with his family before you start hearing wedding bells.|`|vRc7ktcsaa	d*mn kid. it's now the time to learn how to use your mind and not be controlled by your emotions. well teenagers specially females have intense emotions so even though what they are doing is illogical, they still follow it because of what they feel about it. if you end up with him then i feel sorry for you.|`|DqUXn5wFaa	He's old enough to be your DAD!<br>  <br>  ahhhhh!|`|vY0ScgeXaa	yea, if you love the old man, it's ok.<br>  <br>  if you don't love him, don't force yourself to do something just for the money or something, you'll surely regret in the later on.|`|MB1oT04maa	wow..that's a big age difference and the kids would definitely look at you funny ( to say the least)today's society would make it hard on you for sure.besides, in ten years you might have to be his nurse|`|csBvaXjiaa	I will get right to the point.  Break it off.  This relationship is not good and you are right you will never be wifey material for this man.|`|mhxi84xtaa	Ya...move on plz|`|m3q6CIQMaa	Brianna, he's too old for you hun...I'm 21 years old and someone around my age would be a better fit for you.  If you love the guy and you deep down want him and he wants you the same way then I would say you have nothing to worry about.  Hey, at least your not a lesbian and love other girls, right? I'm gay (well bisexual) and I think it's harder for me to tell my parents that I am gay vs. you telling your parents that you are dating a 43 year old man. Another thing to think about too is that he is probably old enough to be your dad.  When you start kissing him & doing all that sort of stuff that u do lol, think about your dad...I know it's gross.  I don't mean to gross you out but that's kind of the thing you have to realize.  Also, he's 43; he's close to retirement age whereas your adult life is just starting.  If you want to get married some day and have kids and a nice family, then you really need to look for a guy that is closer to your age range.  I would say don't go above 25.  And remember, in Joe's eyes, he might be thinking of you as a kid because you are so young that you could technically be his daughter.   I don't want to sound rude; I’m just giving my opinions and thoughts, but maybe he's a perv and likes younger girls.  It's too big of an age difference so set the limit to 25 or something.  If you want to talk further, my Yahoo ID is gmanzari0038.  I’ll be glad to help if I can.<br>  <br>  Anyways, if you want to know what I would do if i were in your shoes, I would go for someone around 21 or 22 yrs old.

Take great care of yourself and it will do wonders for your confidence. You must learn to accept and respect others for who they are in order to grow yourself!

ULkqriEhaa	You'll know if it's not meant to be. If you have that feeling, than there's not point in staying. If you want to be single, then you need to do that for yourself. If you aren't ready for commitment, it's not good to let it go on, it will hurt you and him in the long run more that way.|`|fvN18yvGaa	what does enjoy life mean.....screwing around,  Ive been with the same woman since 89 and I ive enjoyed life every day...And you gotta new bf b4 u ended the 2yr relationship..sounds like ur on the right track to lonely and used ville...|`|hugI8pJeaa	hmmmm a good full on healthy relationship should have NO doubts.. talk to your current bf about it, try and work through it, you may b e glad you did, or he may feel the same way...|`|AA11179568	just follow what you want, dont think too much about the future, because if you're not happy today the future would be nothing|`|9nqa3VHfaa	theres alot of things u should take into consideration here... <br>  1) how long have u known this new guy?<br>  2) how long have u had the feeling about ur current guy?<br>  3) make a pro/con list for both guys<br>  <br>  sometimes, even when youre in a relationship, a new guy can seem thrilling and fresh, that feeling sometimes can be mistaken for desire... new and exciting is not always a good thing. take into account the strength of your current relationship and how much that relationship means to you.<br>  <br>  However, if you feel like you need some time before you commit, maybe thats what you need to do<br>  <br>  I'd suggest that you ask your current bf for some space and time to sort yourself out. cut yourself off from him completely for a few days or even a week and see how much u miss him.|`|kV7WKjtaaa	I don't think it is fair for you or him to go on if you feel that you are not satisfied with him in aspects such as happiness, emotional continuity and motivation.<br>  You have to ask yourself what do you really need in a relationship and what are the consequences of leaving this relation. Don't leave him because you will meet someone new, but because you need to figure out what you really want and what makes you happy.<br>  Also think of him as a person, if he would try his luck somewhere and dump you every now and then, would it be a nice feeling?<br>  Try to be honest with yourself and try to make the right decision after you read some books or self evaluation to ensure that your decision won't make you regret afterwards.<br>  Finally, don't be so hard on yourself, when confusion knocks the door, it means that your are uncertain, and it would only lead to more complications and unpleasant behaviour from both sides.<br>  Good luck.|`|loQcRnlXaa	You just answered your own question dear: "I want to go out, take a break from relationships and enjoy life, before committing into a better rship that lasts"  Just tell him about it, If I was him, yeah I will be hurt at first, but I will respect you for being honest and it's better than have to deal with something that is not real and will definitely be worst later on. SO just be truth to your heart and him and go ahead and enjoy life, just be smart about stuff, (if you know what I mean ;)   be safe!!  but definitely enjoy life...|`|yRYZcYp7aa	Just think what would you feel if your sweet boyfriend did the same thing to you.|`|9FlUlbYXaa	Two years is a long time.  If you don't have feelings for him anymore, then leave.  It would be stupid to stay in a relationship where you are unhappy--that's where cheating comes in.  Going into a new relationship  right after the last one is called rebounding.  Save the both of you some grief and get out.  The 'rule' is to wait for half of the time you were with the last person before you start seeing someone new.  So wait a year after you break up with this one before you get into a new relationship.   You can date a few guys--you know, dinner or lunch, no sex, nothing serious--until then.  That way you don't get lonely or frustrated and won't make a mistake.  Good luck.|`|qbZrYbFUaa	Well first, I was in the same boat as you only a few months ago. My boyfriend had just proposed, on our two year anniversary, and I didn't want to break it off or say no "just in case". But I had just started college. While there was some draw from other guys, it was mostly the feeling that I wanted to be free and decide what I wanted for myself. No matter how great the guy is, if you don't feel connected any more it's cruel to both of you to let it continue. My friends tried telling me that if it was meant to be he would wait, but they're not going to. So if it's a fleeting feeling, I'd think long and hard on it before making a decision. But if you're like me and you had been feeling like there was more to life and love than what you have for a while, I would say it's time to let it go. You may regret it for a while, but it will probably be better in the long run.

The guy that puts it inside is "top" and the guy that receives it is "bottom."  I just found that out not too long ago.  It stumped me as well.|`|7MnJUjo0aa	Wow, way to put it derogatorily, "Mr. Ric". Bottom bi guys means that he is bisexual, and when he has sex with another guy, he is more comfortable being the receiver. =] Hope that clears things up. By the way, tell your friend to be open-minded. Just because he's bi doesn't mean he's gonna leave her for a guy or anything. It just means that he can like both men and women. ^^<br>  <br>  Also, don't let her try to change him. Homosexuality and bisexuality cannot be "cured". It's a natural thing, just like being heterosexual.|`|3FkMjHqlaa	im pretty sure it means that he is bisexual (likes both men and women) and bottom im pretty sure means he is the one that recieves during sex.|`|XgO9HUm9aa	It means he is bisexual and he likes to get f___ed in the bottom during gay sex.|`|M7r7gHNGaa	He is bi-sexual and enjoys being the submissive one.
LS8LcuRaaa	It may hurt the first time when the hymen breaks but after that it shouldn't hurt anymore. Even the first time doesn't have to be painful. I didn't feel any pain. Quite often the girls are too nervous and can't relax and that's why it hurts, especially the first time. If it still hurts later after having had sex a few times it may hurt because she is not wet enough, so there is not enough friction. I guess it's a similar pain for guys. Imagine having sex with a woman who is dry and a woman who is wet. You can feel the difference and wet definitely feels better... So, if the girl feels pain its often a sign that is is not wet enough yet and needs more foreplay.|`|FzFSzilmaa	it hurts, some something it going in... and if there is no lubrication or it is too big, it hurts... either because of friction or stretching...<br>  <br>  someone women enjoy it, some don't...<br>  <br>  try pushing something into one of your orifices, that should show you the pain... :D|`|HUJtZ5hOaa	it hurts because the girl (if shes a virgin)  is still very tight, and small 'down there' and a guys penis is alot bigger, so if you don't include enough foreplay, the girl won't be lubricated/wet enough and it will hurt, but to successfully make her first time pleasurable you will have to make sure shes ready, make her feel comfortable, and happy, foreplay, makes them Horny easily. lol. Just make sure shes ready and It might not hurt as much/at all. <br>  <br>  good luck.|`|4ltupRctaa	it doesnt hurt forever. normally just the first few times unless the guy is HUGE then it will always hurt.|`|HZVahqQ5aa	COS MY MEAT IS MASSIVE

DUH!!!!|`|lFTynrRVaa	don't say anything to her, she will be realise her self.|`|TpMoDiinaa	If your friend is 12 years old, and has an eating disorder, you need to tell an adult. EDs can kill you.

She needs a trained professional. <br>  <br>  This may not be what you want to hear, and she may be angry at you, but isn't worth losing her friendship if it saves her life?|`|WoCXEcsVaa	eating disorders are often brought on by something tragic that's happened<br>  if she's been "mean" this also could be something to do with it<br>  try and talk to her about it<br>  something else could be seriously bothering her<br>  but<br>  approach it carefully <br>  try not to upset her!<br>  <br>  good luck!!!|`|GJvZlscpaa	If your worried about her, talk to her if you havnt already.  i dont know why  said about braces, that kinda confused me cuz tat has nothing to do with an eating disorder but anyway<br>  ....<br>  Being a supportive friend also means learning how to behave around someone with an eating disorder. Here are some ways to support a friend who is battling an eating problem:<br>  <br>  -Try your best not to talk about food, weight, diets, or body shape (yours, your friend's, or even a popular celebrity's). <br>  -Try not to be too watchful of your friend's eating habits, food amounts, and choices. <br>  -Try not to make statements like, "If you'd just eat (or stop working out so much), you'll get better." <br>  -Focus on your friend's strengths — that he or she has a great smile, is helpful and friendly, or good at math or art. <br>  -Try to avoid focusing on how your friend looks physically. <br>  -Most important, remind your friend that you're there no matter what. <br>  -You want to help him or her get healthy again. Sometimes you'd be surprised how asking simple questions such as "what can I do to help?" or "what would make you feel better?" can lead to a great conversation about how you can help your friend heal.<br>  <br>  <br>  hope this helps :)
264cbcb58c2a9871fb67a37251391020aa	The ability to stand up for yourself stems from self-confidence.  It sounds like she isn't as confident in herself as she should be, and so she wants to please people, and then blames herself when it goes wrong.<br>  <br>  It's difficult to help her if you're not actually there, but you can make your views known, support her good decisions, advise against her bad ones, and be supportive of her if things go wrong - that's what being a friend is all about.  But don't get too overbearing.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately until she gets the self-confidence and assertiveness she needs, things are unlikely to change.|`|vY0ScgeXaa	well<br>  <br>  if she punch a guy would the guy punch back? and might hurt her? <br>  <br>  if she punch a guy, would it violate the laws?<br>  <br>  the way i can think of is simply:<br>  <br>  tell her to buy a gun LEGALLY and get a gun concealing licence, anytime anyone threaten her, ask her to take out the gun and point at the guy who threaten her. nobody will piss her off no more.|`|vhuzsMPsaa	You're a lucky man.  Unless one's been out of the country, or has family elsewhere, they may not realize how aggressive we Americans are. We're very opinionated.  She shouldn't learn to tell people off.

C8DOT8Y7aa	Establish a more-than-just-friends relationship. Start by asking her for something to play on, like if you are in her class, ask her for a pencil or eraser. If she's slightly interested, she might play about, teasing you for it. Don't worry, it's not that she doesn't like you. She expects you to play along, so maybe walk off in mock sulk, don't do it too heavily though. She might start to think you are weird if you do. If she comes by you and asks you who you like, you know you are on the right track. They are probably just as nervous as you, so they want to get that type of approach as well. This probably means that they like you, and your job just got much easier. <br>  Compliment her, but be careful. Unless they are desperate, they might think you are desperate or making something too obvious. So maybe tell her you like her new hairstyle but then go behind her and mess around with it, spice it up. She'll like your courage to go play about with her hair but make sure she doesn't have dandruff or lice because although you might not be too bothered, she will get embarrassed and scared to go near you. Also, don't lay it on like you've seen in the movies: "I like your handbag.". No guy, in school, will honestly care about a handbag. Something you might truly like you can compliment on. <br>  Start a ball game (not literally). Be a little far away and look at her, admire her. She'll catch your gaze and look at you. Look away suddenly but keep an eye out for her looking back at you. If she is, get up and walk past her, possibly giving her a little smile as you go. <br>  Have chats with her. Ask her if she has any pets and find out some interesting things. Make sure she knows you inside out as well. <br>  Move in closer, be alone and look down. Look up at her eyes, look lost in her world for a second, and then say "I,(pause),like you. So...(cough)..Will you go out with me" While you say this look down. Look up when you say me and smile questioningly. If that isn't your style, there is another way to ask a girl out. All you have to do is walk up (make sure she's alone), and ask her to go out with you in a confident (but relaxed!) manner. <br>  Don't try too hard, girls aren't stupid, they can tell when you get desperate. Be relaxed and confident in yourself. <br>  Don't just become friends with her, become friends with all of her friends, as relationships are made and broken on her friends' opinions. <br>  If she says no, she means NO. Just back off for awhile, leave her to cool down, but don't give up complete hope. <br>  Be confident, not cocky. The difference is there, and very noticeable for girls. Make jokes and be self-confident; women love it when men make them laugh. <br>  When the time comes to ask her out, wait for the opportune moment. Trust your instincts; they will tell you when the time is right. As mentioned earlier, it's probably best not to do it in front of her friends or in front of your friends. It's easier for both of you if you are alone. <br>  If she says "I'll think about it" it's not a good sign, although she could just be nervous, or caught up in the moment, and she's being careful not to make a stupid mistake. Don't bug her about it, let it go a few days - if she doesn't bring it up again, it's a no. <br>  Don't ask her out as a dare, or as a joke - this can really hurt a girl's feelings. Be sure that you are doing it because you want to, if you don't you could really become known as a jerk. <br>  If you see any facial expressions, like an eye raise, make sure you say, "it's okay if you say no."|`|WyCmQBuvaa	Hi So-n-so.  I was wondering.....do you like funny movies (or drama or something you KNOW she likes) ?   You do?  Would you like to see Raiders of Your Underwear with me on Friday?  I promise not to grope you "too" much when the lights go down.  I'll even spring for junior mints.|`|X4Owk0xTaa	Make sure it's not all formal or cheesy, keep things cool and casual like "Hey did you wanna hang out this weekend?" that way if she kindly rejects you, then you won't feel like a fool for even using the word 'date'.|`|DhwcHdfVaa	Ok being a  girl, the more romantic the better! <br>  <br>  Go all out and say to her 'I really like you a lot, can I take you out this weekend?' or something like that. <br>  <br>  Chivalry cannot be dead, be romeo :)|`|99399280e2e93e47c5b56b48ad0d3730aa	I suggest you get to know the girl first through her friends. That will help you to ask the right question.|`|UI6vdCrWaa	hi, you wan to go out on a date?<br>  <br>  <br>  easy|`|9V89R22Paa	It would be good to show her you are interested before you say "Will you go out with me?" <br>  <br>  For instance, find every reason to talk to her - (just don't overdo it). She'll recognize something from this. Eventually this can lead to a friendship. Then, when the timing feels right, casually and softly suggest to her that you'd like to show her a good time.<br>  <br>  The more you make it seem like you don't really care as much as you really do (how casually you talk to her), the more welcoming she will be, trust me.<br>  <br>  When a guy seems super nervous it's a total turn off and makes the girl feel like she's not approachable & sets things off on an uncomfortable tone.<br>  <br>  It's ok to be a little nervous, but use the nervous energy towards being witty and making her laugh about little things, just make conversation about things that pertain to her or whats going on in general.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|PuQ0rIKWaa	hmm this ones a toughie.<br>  maybe if you went up to her and asked her to hang out... idk.<br>  its really hard<br>  you could try c4ing her<br>  if that doesnt work you can resort the the grenade in your turban<br>  make sure there is hummus near the grenade and the turban is golden<br>  and if that doesnt work say "muhajeem infidel c4 suicide bomber!"<br>  <br>  anus puff|`|tgEZvZSFaa	Hey I really want to see this movie but none of my friends can come.

I believe Xianity doesn't condone premarital sex.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, there is nothing wrong with any consenting, available, responsible adults having sex....but I also don't buy into religious dogma (much of which is very limiting where sexual partners and activity are concerned).<br>  <br>  So, basically you choose your desire or your religion. That's why most xians are known as "cafeteria christians"...they pick the parts of their religion/bible they agree with and live along those lines, they pretend the parts they don't agree with don't exist or are misinterpreted/mistranslated.|`|5sTPhPGiaa	Nothing at all.|`|wWbqEXLtaa	I believe in god, and god gave us a life that we, ourselves can use.<br>  <br>  Do want you want with it as long as you hurt no-one.<br>  sex isnt hurting anyone.<br>  and of course you would get married if you could, but you just cant because of finnancial circumstances.

zSXjd1Praa	Tell her.<br>  Flat out tell her what you feel about her. Don't hesitate, just do it.|`|nfrERZLOaa	Just tell her, be friends with her. if you tell her now you wont regret later. Email her if you cant tell her directly.

Put differently, you might be the hottest guy (or girl) in your high school... a la the star quarterback, or head cheerleader in hotness... but don't expect to win a beauty pageant, or make a living as a Playboy or Chippendale's model.|`|iTJ2YIH5aa	same as like good means in comparision to very very good where very very good represent 10.|`|RhUjwovKaa	well i would say that is really quite hot seriosley.|`|jGKGlxAuaa	slightly above average.

yPX1E3Bbaa	like you said, she was jealous because you were surrounded by woman at work and not once you mentioned them to your fiancee at all. and no, you didn't do anything wrong. just assure her that they mean nothing to you and she's the most important person in your life and i'm sure everything will get along fine.|`|uGNJK5zKaa	no you are not, you would have been if you would of just sid her name or your friend or something like that but since you said your fiance thats perfectly fine, and she might be mad just because they are other females around you and speaking to you even though if the girls dont eman anythign to you , thats just how some girls are
iOa7rriGaa	If someone doesn't like you for who you are then you don't need them any ways and not all girls are like that and how would you know you haven't met every girl in the world have you? No so don't say all of us are that way if you wouldn't mind. All you can do is be yourself and one day you'll find a girl who does like you. And remember your not the only one out there who feels this way a lot of girls have said and felt the exact same way about guys. Don't give up not yet because if you do you'll never be happy.|`|yepd9psLaa	wel im guessing your in hs well theres hope for everyone. super ugly guys get good jobs make money then you can get them and sometimes they just fall in love. take care of your smile be funny and cool and u will get one. mabe you will grow on one, thats what alway happens. or maybe ur not ugly and just need to workout and cut your hair or something quit hating and do something about it .work out EVERYONE LIKES A NICE BODY,
zSXjd1Praa	I won't give you a lecture on 'too young' and all that rubbish. When you want a relationship, you get one. Simple as.<br>  This is probably not feelings that you want to dump him. This is probably getting mixed with your true feelings to him.<br>  If you don't want to dump him, don't. It doesn't matter about the occasional feeling, as long as you keep the relationship!
7b6177ffccd38a7fe7428a728f8a79c1aa	I would let him go.  Sometimes relationships wind down, through no fault of anyone.  The best thing you can do is let it go, enjoy the fun and happiness you once shared, and then move on to someone new.  While great sex helps, it cannot fix everything.|`|wWbqEXLtaa	sex|`|6iDJ9Tlzaa	Sometimes relationships die out because you're just not right for each other. However, that may not be the case here, so see what you can do to fix it. First and foremost, you need to have good communication. Talk to him and see what he's feeling and ask him what's missing from your relationship. Most often, it will be something sexual. Guys like variety and being with the same woman for so long can really get old and stale. It's just human nature... the woman in the relationship needs to be open minded and willing to keep the sex life wild and interesting. If it's not that then it's most likely about equal share... men don't like women who don't contribute equally to a relationship (whether financially or otherwise... taking initiative, being interesting and entertaining, having your own friends and hobbies so he doesn't feel like you're tagging along, etc).
8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	all those things, in combination, are signs that a guy likes you...
Wi9nmYIEaa	shorter...different coloured wig but a pretty plain one so he doesn't notice you and look closer....some glasses.....and get a friend to drive you in her car...if he is cheating...I doubt that he is thinking that straight.....but paranoia can make him be a little more watchful while out in public....keeping an eye on people so that he doesn't get busted ....good luck :  )|`|PvAIY7OPaa	Thank you very much for the laugh.What is more funny is how creative and wild some people who answered you were lol.<br>  <br>  You think the man is cheating already and you do not want to let it go until you have hard evidence on your face. <br>  <br>  Wear blond long wig and put some very heavy make-up kinda like geesha the chinese,your hair should cover half of your face (it is not suspicious and i do my hair most of the time like that), get some chinese dress or japanese oh no wear indian saree the long outfit those asians wear and i bet on my yearly salary he would not know who you are.<br>  <br>  P.S. when you see him just maintain your dignity and walk away. <br>  <br>  That above answers your question but my advise to you is follow your intuition and get out of the relationship before the getting is right. Do you think this man deserves all this time? I think not<br>  <br>  Either way Good luck!|`|AtJXqxN2aa	lol ok well dont look too suspicious.start with his phone, check his messages or call log.try listening on his phone calls.when he's not home look through his pants to see if he's got anything that would make u think he's really cheating. hope that helps! dont forget never hint to him anything like if he said something in a text to the other girl that said "u r the apple of my eye" dont mention that to him while he's in the room. good luck|`|AA11591803	If he is cheating and you know it then why bother?<br>  <br>  If you must know the photo's are the best thing and when you do 'catch' him...just present the photo's to him.<br>  <br>  As far as attire...just blend in to the crowd. Wear your hair differently, dress conservatively, just change from your normal appearance.|`|UnMramoWaa	A wig, dark glasses and normal clothes.  In a trench and a scarf and hat you will be very noticeable.|`|Ag8pE3Cyaa	You don't spy on a boyfriend you believe is cheating.........you dump him.|`|L2Nde54Haa	ninja gear!|`|FXZLNc1aaa	If you can afford it(and you probably can now that the economy's in the dumper, they will BEG for work), get a PI to "snoop around" for you. He/she will know what to do, where to go, what to use/etc. Then, listen to what they say, and go from there. if he is indeed "cheating", then it's time for you to leave him.|`|0b719092b4d69772e046d90f96e26879aa	Don't wear all black, it makes it look more suspicious. You want to look normal but unrecognizable. Wear things that he hasn't seen you wear before. Maybe a friend's jacket, scarf, etc? <br>  You could also just get a close friend to do it for you.<br>  I hope he's not cheating, but catch the bastard!|`|r23H0m30aa	hi<br>  first of all i wouldnt be a spy just dnt waste ur time girl..i would do the same as he do start to have distance to him and try to hook up with someone else..why not...he isnt worth it believe ...me<br>  I just started to have an online messaging with my bf as i ve discovered his got a profile on date side he admitted there he is single....but i think he is a fu... idiot and all of it i ve got fun of him now<br>  Do the same and cheer up..|`|4UQegWk0aa	A William Shatner mask would be a good idea....<br>  <br>  But seriously, is there any way you could get someone to do it for you? Like a friend he has never met? It might take him a while to actually catch him at it, and the longer it takes, the more chance you have of being rumbled.|`|SHoGWZWPaa	I would just wear the hat and sunglasses and tuck your hair in the hat. The scar may be overboard. Wear a color that is dull and doesn't attract attention. For example don't wear white or red.|`|0ox8VKwKaa	I think you have a good plan. A friend of my wife nailed her husband that way. She went to a bar she thought they met and was disguised. She walked over to him and completely floored him.|`|BbRewQjQaa	Cut your hair and change the hair color dress different and stay incognito|`|x0mf6Fp4aa	This is a sure shot way to find out if your husband is cheating. when he is in the shower in playing outside with his car grab his cell phone. Take down all the numbers you dont recognizie. Write them and hide the list somewhere. Now when he goes home or to work check out a site like the one below. You can find out all of the people he was talking to by doing a reverse number search. This even works with cell phones. It sucks I know but this is how I find my slutty ex-girlfriend was talking to multiple guys and I had hard proof and she had to admit to it.  See- <a href="http://www.reversecallsearch.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.reversecallsearch.com</a><br>  <br>  P.s. you can even take down addresses and later on when he says he is at work drive past the girls house and see if his car is outside.

If he is or you suspect him to be cheating, leave him alone. Why waste you precious time and even if you did "catch" him, then what? It will lead you to more grief, sometimes what you don't know (or see) wont hurt you.  He might even be doing it on purpose, knowing it bothers you and he wants only to "play with your mind".  He is selfish only thinking about himself, he doesn't care about you at all.  LEAVE HIM ALONE, there are so many others. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.|`|wTGwLfNkaa	All black is pretty bold.

VYCLwKwNaa	You are learning to trust your instincts. You know that something is not right here. Good for you!<br>  <br>  Some advice......<br>  #1. You don't have to go out (or go with) with someone just because he asked you out. And if he had your number, he could have asked you out before, couldn't he?<br>  #2.  You don't have to go out with anybody at all, if you don't want to. Even if you don't have a boyfriend and have nothing to do.<br>  #3. You can ask somebody out, (such as the guy that you think likes you) if you want to spend time with them. Tell them that you are going to go get ice cream, or to see Watchmen, or to do something else, and ask them if they want to come? Keep it casual, but if they have time and like you, they'll come. If they don't have time and like you, they'll realize that it is ok, and soon they will ask you out. If they don't ask you out, then you'll know.<br>  #4.  If you want to spend time with someone, but not "go out" with them, you can suggest an alternative, such as meeting in Starbucks after work to catch up on what they have been doing.<br>  #5. So, he asked you to be his girlfriend, without ever taking you out? Either he knows what he wants, or he's just hoping you'll make it easy for him. I suppose he'd like to get into your pants, too, ya think? I still believe that if he didn't think to call you until he saw you at the store, he's not ready to give what it takes to have a real relationship. It's a little weird to ask for a commitment without having spent much time together. If you feel like you need to answer him, and don't want to close the door on a possible relationship, just say that you will go out with him, and take it slow.  Then, you'll have a chance to see how he treats you and see how long it takes before he shows you what he really wants out of the relationship. And what he's willing to give.<br>  <br>  Take charge of your social life. It's less stressful than waiting and wondering.|`|19iD220Jaa	Weigh your options.... I would go out with both = not as a player but to see for yourself who you click or connect more with. The guy that you have the biggest crush on could be biggest mistake or waste of time ever... trust me... give them both a chance and although it sounds lame.... sit down and do a PRO N CON LIST for the two. Use your senses and not just your eyes... sometimes its hard to understand what it is your heart is saying or even wants off the rip. Good luck|`|PYZ3APQDaa	the question is a little confusing.

yiux97Wbaa	If you do nothing, you will always wonder if you ever had a chance of getting her back, and it will nag at you forever.  Try to spend some time with her and tell her how you feel when you feel the time is right.  If she is still interested, it cold be a good new beginning, or if she's not at least you will know and you can start moving on with your life.  Love is never easy, and sometimes you have to take the chances of looking stupid to get what you want.|`|csBvaXjiaa	You never know until you try.

tU5NJVL3aa	Bravo -- you sound more like a man than your brother does.  Warn him that you won't just stand idly by and let stuff like that go on.  Tell him you ARE minding your own business -- he is family and you will not let him screw around like that.  You need to let your parents know and see what they can do to help you.  If he gets physical again you are going to have to call the authorities (regardless of her protests, which I'm sure she will make).  Do not be intimidated, you will be doing what is best for her and the baby.  Good luck.|`|2SmIk1PQaa	well, you've spoken to him, as the others suggested, try saying:  <br>  I've approached you about this, given you a chance to change your ways, but you didn't take the opportunity to do so, as a result I am going to do what I think is best for this baby.<br>  you need to stay calm, if he wants a fight, don't give it to him,<br>  you need to go down to the police station and tell them about what's happening, if you want to give him another chance then contact your parents, or talk to somebody you trust at your school, this needs to be sorted, this man could harm his girlfriend, or her baby, it is obvious that you, a 16 year old, care far more about this baby and about his girlfriend than he does, if you do want to talk to the girlfriend before hand search online for what abuse to a pregnant woman can do to the baby, or read about it in a book, get some information about it and talk to the girlfriend about why she needs to get as far away from him as possible, to ensure her baby is healthy, if he is abusing her full on, then imagine what he could do to the child once he/she has been born, when they get older he could abuse them in the same way that he abused the girlfriend, also, go down to the refuge and talk to them, tell them what's happening, they will probably give you better advice than we can because they are trained to do so.<br>  good luck, you seem like a lovely person!|`|pZGVI9dPaa	Try talking to him first before you tell others or get the police involved. It needs to be stopped before he hurts her or the baby. When you talk to him let him know what you are planning to do if you see or hear anything about the abuse again. If you feel you can't talk to him show him this question you posted unless you think he might get mad at you and hurt you. If none of the above  works or you feel like you'd be putting yourself in danger then you really need to tell someone else. Do it quickly because something bad might happen to her if you don't. I hope everything will be okay.|`|un0gZ7Ybaa	It's best that you don't try to handle this whole situation by yourself. This has to be handled by the police. She needs a restraining order against him.<br>  <br>  It's very hard for her to leave him. She is living in fear. The probable reason she is still with him is because she has nobody else. Maybe she can stay with someone like a friend or someone. Look up sites on abusive relationships. You'll learn that it is a cycle and the victims feel trapped. Your brother also needs counseling and anger management.<br>  <br>  I really hope the best for your brother, his girlfriend, and your future nephew/niece. Also, I want to say that you are very brave for seeking help.
1ZDdUP4taa	Just because you have feelings doesn't make you a lesbian.  Everyone has homosexual feelings at different times, although few will admit it.<br>  <br>  Being curious about your girlfriend doesn't mean anything more than that you're attracted to her.<br>  <br>  It doesn't mean you have to act on it, and if you do, it doesn't mean you have to come out to the world as a lesbian couple.  In this day and age, being bi-curious seems to be the norm for many young woman, and no one will look down on you, if you do something about it.<br>  <br>  That being said, you have to evaluate how valuable this friendship is to you, in the event that it doesn't work out, or becomes awkward after an encounter.<br>  <br>  Maybe just talk to her, do it once, just to get it out of your system.  Heck, get a guy involved if it feels too awkward, I'm sure he won't mind. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|ULkqriEhaa	Well, maybe you are a lesbian. That or you are confusing a strong friendship love with a romantic love.<br>  <br>  Ask yourself, could you ever think of kissing her (do you want to) or having sex with her...?<br>  <br>  Maybe you are bi? Maybe you just love her, not other girls, because she is special to you...If it's a sexual/desiring/romantic love, that will help out with your sexuality...<br>  <br>  If you are being overly paranoid - you may just worry you love her romantically but just REALLY lover her as a person|`|EAlIwQxCaa	its fine lol u like people for there qualities and not gender act how u feel is right alright and u aint lesbian ur probably bi

nk3QCoPvaa	Well this can be tricky. Let him know you don't want to get married yet, but also let him know that you are very flattered that he wants to marry you, and very clear that if you were in a place where you wanted to get married, that marrying him would be your first choice. (I asked a girl once in my twenties. She declined because she was in the same place you are in. But what I heard was her saying no to ME. And I dumped her not long after.)|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Tell him exactly that.  Let him know that while you do love him, you're not ready and do not want to rush things at this time.  Good luck.|`|P3Mt18Usaa	Just tell him you don't want to settle down yet but you still love him.|`|loQcRnlXaa	Hello from Ft Bragg troop!  Hey, like all these kids are telling you here, just tell him exactly that, tell the truth, it will save a lot of MAYOR pain in the future if you do.|`|6gt4sK2Paa	Tell him
R1ecMOO8aa	if there is no difference of opinion, no fight, no quarrel, it is known that the feeling is mutual and true.  This is a blind belief made to each other and followed.
qbZrYbFUaa	If you are officially dating, as in someone asked the other out, say that you don't feel like having a serious relationship and you would prefer to be friends. Most guys won't be too traumatized after only a couple weeks. If it's just a lot of touchy-feely stuff without the boyfriend/girlfriend status tell him you don't want to rush into anything and a relationship isn't really on your to-do list right now.|`|EAlIwQxCaa	ok say that you think the relationship is going too quickly and that you need some time off to just think about it and that in the future when you guys know each other better then you guys can continue|`|uqwc9O2Oaa	you should tell him your situation and if he is that gentleman,he would understand that...and u said that you are not sure you like the guy,so that's not a bog problem to deal with...|`|t8HPCzrOaa	hey hun well just talk to him bout it and tell him your not read for a relationship right now tell him you got alot on your head and you want to calm yourself first before anything just tell him in a nice way and see what happens good luck|`|I7V1GwS1aa	Tell him that but simpler. lol<br>  like<br>  "Hey, things are moving too fast for me, and I'm not sure I'm ready for a relationship with you.

1ZDdUP4taa	Confront her and ask her how long she's been having an affair with Gerald.<br>  <br>  You know, by what you've said here, what's been going on.  She's lying to you, and running around behind your back.<br>  <br>  If she confesses, and she wants to try to work out, I say give her another chance.  If she still denies it then tell her what you know, what you saw, that you did NOT spy on her, but you innocently found out she's been lying to you, and sneaking around behind your back. <br>  <br>  Tell her you hope she's happy with Gerald, and break it off with her now.<br>  <br>  You don't need a woman who lies to you manipulating your life, and you deserve to be happy.|`|Lukp2K4Iaa	'I ORDERED PANCAKES DAMMIT!, NOT WAFFLES"|`|W5h7UfZmaa	move on-  Action may not always bring happiness , BUT there is no happiness WITH OUT ACTION        - STILL IN HER ROOM sounds childish you deserve better Don't think gerald is mush better , Don't be afraid to take the big step you can't cross a road in two smell steps good luck|`|qbZrYbFUaa	I'm sorry, bud. It sounds like your girl was probably using you as a way to get close to your friend. Maybe it didn't start out that way but it's definitely what's happening now. She's using the fact that her "mistruths" are making the relationship rocky to turn everything against you. Not only is she trying to make you out to be the bad guy, she's turning your friend against you. All she's doing is using your rocky relationship to pick up another guy. Honestly, no matter how much it sucks, you probably just have to give up on this one. Don't take it personally, she'll probably do it to him, too.|`|ctJsLe2Taa	well maybe at first it was just a friend thing . girls like to have a guy friend that they can talk to about their boyfriend. then your gf tought you were getting jealous so she lied to you by saying she was in her room. well i would dump her and trust your friend gerald because of the guy code(not fooling around with your friends girl) but he problably did so it makes him an even bigger dush so just stay away from your paranoid manipulating gf.|`|Rg2ERXAtaa	punch him in the mouth,boot her to the curb,obviously there's more going on|`|7ZlCIC7taa	game on my friend ,we have a game player in our midst,or 2 of them to be precise. I'm guessing you guys are in your early 20's tops. There is a lot of interrelational experimantation occuring around you .You are probably more  safer to be outside of it.These 2 are playing ,which is fine but you dont want to be in this sandwich.You sound very reasonable and level headed,possibly too accomadating for your own good.Your girlfriend has some issues she will work through over time ,but again, you may not need to be fodder for this girls emotional development.there is nothing sinister afoot ,but this scenario is not for you,this is my guess ,and just a guess.It seems safer for them both to be in this 'help eachother thru' paradigm,rather than the greater stress of an actual relationship which your girlfriend obviously has difficulty finding peace in. good luck and persist if you like ,but i suggest you open your  posssibility of a more suitable and mature thinking partner. best of luck.

I would never date a girl that didn't eat healthy and exercise.  Exercise is very important and anyone who doesnt do it regularly is not taking care of the one and only body they were given.  If you are putting in the effort and are healthy, then your frame type isnt a big deal because all types can be beautiful in their own way.  <br>  If your worried about your size because you are big and its because you never exercise or take care of yourself, then its probably sloppy weight and its gross. I dont know anyone that prefers that.<br>  I hate when girls who dont take care of themselves say that its just their body type.|`|KFjwyAIUaa	Every guy is different. Most big guys like big girls. Personally, I like to be able to throw my girl around like a rag doll so I like them thin/athletic with nice chest and bum.
O3EtP4vOaa	Here is how I would determine the answer to your question...<br>  <br>  if you have learned from your mistakes and you know that is was wrong and you do not get yourself involved in something like this again then no I do not believe you are a **** you just made a mistake.<br>  <br>  If you have not learned from this and continue bionking others husbands then yeah I guess in my book I would consider you a ****.<br>  <br>  As to dealing with the wife and you job.  Your career is important and do not let this interfer with it.  If his dumd wife is out running her mouth then maybe remind her that it was her husband that had sex with you and she is the dumd *** that is still with him so obviously she doesn't have that much of a problem with it or she would have left him.  Yell her to get over it or leave him that it was him choice, he cheated on her you did not cheat on her.|`|Q2UDhYgkaa	Don't quit your job if it is important to you. I have read statistics that say married men hardly ever leave their wives for the other woman.<br>  <br>  I actually read an article by a male collumnist recently and he said 'don't be the other woman' because generally women wait around for years for the man to divorce his wife and guess what? It hardly ever happens.<br>  <br>  Most married men just want you as the bit on the side - stay away until he divorces his wife. Do what Angelina Jolie did - waited until Brad left Jen before sleeping with him (I believed it when she said that).<br>  <br>  Sorry I read that you won't do it again - well thats good - everyone makes mistakes and you won't ever be the other woman again.|`|iOa7rriGaa	Well if your uncomfortable in the work place you shouldn't stay there because you'll hate working there in the end. As long as you know you made a mistake and you learned something from it and won't do it again then no your not a **** you just made a very poor decision and now can make sure it'll never happen again. If you do stay stop hanging around the married guy you had an affair with out of respect for his wife you owe her that much and know she'll never like you no matter how good a person you are because to her your mistake probably really hurt her marriage and she'll never get over that and like you said I don't blame her. All you can do is go on with your life from this point on.
TbMBaKw3aa	wait...wtf....she kissed you then slapped you?<br>  ok...she's a psycho|`|8jzuA2Ovaa	Okay dude, this is what you're going to do. You're gonna walk up to her at the end of your class and talk to her, make small talk, then say you have to get back to your friends, but before you go, ask her if she'd like to go out for coffee sometime and if she says yes, you're in. Over coffee or something talk to her and tell her how you feel and if she likes you back, she'll tell you.|`|eU2xTwVzaa	ok when she kissed u did u say anything to her before she slapped u if u did then and she just snapped then she is probably bipolar and has mood swings. but the next time u see her try using the Direct approach. its ur life ignore what ur friends say at least u tried right

R1ecMOO8aa	you can ask, no problem.  But, your friendship will be cut. so, you decide yourself.
R1ecMOO8aa	you ask some details on hearsay.  you also don't personally know any such couples.  so, there is no truth in your arguments, because we also don't know any such couples.|`|Jg6VnhFlaa	Does the younger guy leave older woman for a younger girl?

ZwnfiWkaaa	I am a 17yo boy but I can tell you this.<br>  <br>  I have read that the girth (circumference) is usually more important than the length. <br>  You are of average size so if she dislikes your size than her expectations are WAY to high. Her 8-9 inch ex is fairly lucky to have a long penis.<br>  If you haven't been in a sexual relationship before, understand that sex isn't about the size of your penis, it is the love you to share. So don't think that you both won't enjoy sex, just as long as you are both happy and comfortable and love each other.|`|AA11447210	Having a larger than average member, doesn't mean the guy has a clue what to do with it.<br>  <br>  IMO as long as you are at least in the average rang, and can wield it well, you're gonna be fine. Stop letting an issue you have no control over (the size of your 'richard') shake your confidence.<br>  <br>  As long as size is adequate, it's all in how you use it!|`|COc5U2nJaa	I'm 8 inches when its all straightened out, mine is curved.

If the guy was 9 inches and she liked it, yeah she'll probably want to feel/experience/get filled up like that again. So unless she's heads over heels in love with you, she'll want it again or at least be fantasizing about it.|`|PXrrPVjvaa	I'm a virgin, but I think girth is probably more important than length, you know?<br>  Like, it'd be better to feel it going in than to have it slamming against your uterus.
IPS3hWweaa	Ask her if she flushed her brain down the toilet. If she agrees, its time to find a new gf.
dHHkMB6Haa	time is the cure dear. be normal and try not to express you feelings overly to him, rather let him find u and he vil if he likes u.
POZvhqj4aa	she said you are too young you don't want to get pregnant and go to school while your friends are still young and enjoying their teens years when you have to become a mother and you have to grow up so soon to be responsible for the baby I know you might think you are just dating but the temptations will push you into that situations so listen to your mother.|`|kD6M3Banaa	at least tell us your age...|`|HQKuzxulaa	You are only 11 ! It seems as though it was only the other day when you were still in diapers and  that's the way it must feel to your mom. Try and see things from her point of view as well. Don't be in such a hurry, in a couple of years you'll be a teenager, you can start dating then. I know patience doesn't make much sense when you are 11, but you'll have to listen to your mom. Good luck.|`|8K3IucU3aa	you aren't mature enough is most likely her reason. my mom said i wasn't allowed to date until i turned 16 and every time i asked her why she always said "what are you going to do with a boyfriend?" i hated that it made me feel like she thought i was loose. too many kids your age get boyfriends and start having sex, and i know you aren't them but you can still be like them. why is having a boyfriend so important anyway, you don't need a boy to live your life.|`|s63U2ccFaa	She doesn't want you to be having a boyfriend at 11,it's just a crush. And she doesn't want you to get hurt. You'll laugh at this when your in love when your older.|`|8YZoW8K7aa	Why are American parents so overly overprotective? Ok cos your 11 I sort of get it. Wait till teen years at least.|`|R2sgWuqUaa	Your mom doesn't want to see you getting hurt anymore. She's just trying to protect you, that's all. Give your mom a while to calm down, and then speak with her again. Let her know that you are a responsible and mature person. <br>  Also, never raise your voice or shout - because if you do, this shows that you cannot solve a problem in an orderly manner, which can reflect on your relationships in family and love.<br>  Good luck.|`|GWnA9HZ8aa	11 years old... <br>  Anyways I asked my mom if I could  date at 11 and she said whenever you are ready you can. So I asked a girl out and then I told my mom when we went out. That was a bad choice. Now I just ask people out and stuff, without her knowledge. <br>  <br>  I am not encouraging you to go behind your moms back. But that is your choice to make.|`|nMc1TKJaaa	I think that U're sooooooo young to have a boyfriend & be in love. Just do the things the girls at your age does.

Don't worry. the time rushes for me & U 2.|`|bIpcVlBaaa	you are so young girl.<br>  how do u know that u can choose the right person.<br>  how can u understand the guys thinking.<br>  how do u know that he isnt gonna harm you..<br>  maybe yr mother is right.......|`|0RMBQphHaa	I think 11 is quite young you should be having fun not being tyed down by boys, they can really hurt you so go have fun.|`|ge5x9NHxaa	You are just 11 years.  It's not good for you to start dating guys at this age.  That's why your mum is protecting you.  She's doing the right thing.|`|PpYl2dFVaa	well<br>  she might be right<br>  i dont know cause u never said how old you are<br>  parents generally are right believe it or not|`|fIrDIUjjaa	Because you're too young, perhaps naive and ignorant, and she's scared you will get hurt.<br>  <br>  Another thing; having a relationship with a boy can lead from one thing to another, very quickly, and that's why parents don't let their kids have boyfs, because they've been there, and know what happens.<br>  I know our probably a sensible girl, and say you won't have sex, but also, you're on your period, which means that you can get pregnant. Your friends, probably have boyfs, because they don't have their period yet, which means that they can't have boyfriends.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Eleven years of age is much to young to have boyfriends, you should just be worrying about your friends, not boyfriends. You have your whole life ahead of you to date.<br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong about having a boyfriend and being sensible in the matter. And having one at 11 probably means that you won't even kiss. So maybe if you promise your Mum that you won't do any stuff like that.<br>  But your Mum is just protecting you, your really young, curious, and fragile.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about this guy, just cos your not officially his girlfriend, doesn't mean he's oout of your life. You can still be mates, and hang out with eachother. I know you like the idea of havinga boyfriend, but friends are just as better.|`|zJTBAeuOaa	if your mom let you date before she should know if you're ready. my advice is to go on group dates. take two of your girlfriends and ask them to bring their guy friends you bring yours and just hang out. its fun safe and everybody is happy. your mom just wants to protect you. she just wants to know who you're with. so invite the guy over so your mom can get to know him. of course with her permission and see what happens. you're eleven. i think your mom is right you are too young. but like i said have your friends over to hang out at home. and if  its ok with your mom do group dates where you guys can just go to the movies or hang out at the mall.|`|qsrfu9x6aa	Woa, you're too young, kid. But, if you really wanna date, just tell your mom to give you another chance or let's say you're last chance. :)

xhUqLOJaaa	I've been to a muslim wedding and the family were very modern and wealthy so didn't segregate the women and men at all. Families sat together and ate together and also the women didn't wear headscarves either. It was really enjoyable and the food was exquisite!|`|vhlORK4Waa	The Nikah is normally carried out in the mosque and the bride is represented by proxy. That is THE wedding.<br>  <br>  The rest is celebration and whether segregation applies or not seems to depend on the origin and practices of the Muslim family. I have been to a friend's wedding meals and although the tables were segregated, the whole event was mixed, and very enjoyable it was too. Some girls were wearing saris and no hijab, others wearing shalwar kameez and no hijab, others shalwar kameez and hijab, and one or two in full niqab and they were over in a corner.<br>  <br>  Halcon|`|aipChC3haa	Yes, because women are seen as below men so most of the time they sit behind the men.|`|eu4q4WbEaa	you see...women who go to Muslim weddings are usually Muslim and they cover their hear outside (hijab)...and it would be hard for them to all celebrate together because women could not have their hair done of anything...<br>  <br>  And it is more comfortable that way because you can be loud and laugh all you want...but when guys are around, you have to be more careful...|`|GKFSnLqxaa	They get bombed a lot,especially in Afghanistan lol.
eBV12gG7aa	Try not to fall into the jealousy trap, emotional & spiritual problems lifestyle and have passion for life, love yourself, spend regular time with your friend, show her how much you care but don't make her feel guity, manipulate her or crtitcise too much and be there when ye need eachother and don't fall into the love is all that matters trap because you need more than love and you must both have some things in common that it won't treathen your future as a couple and try to trust each other and be emotionally open and joke with each other and be honest.|`|MfzJROnJaa	What I'm doing with my friends is we are all gonna buy a holiday home in Spain together then every year at summer we will go there and have a fun time! Then we can catch up on each other's lives and not lose each other. If its a girlfriend just keep her number keep texting and ringing her every now and then, email her, write to her etc! Good luck xxx|`|qeNrGoMsaa	Just be he true friend always, call her randomly just to check on her.<br>  Ask how her boyfriend is and if it's going well? Fore most just be there when she cries and needs a shoulder. She may never be the one you marry. You may wish that, but she may always be your friend. Then you might luck out and when that time comes and you both are single may see each other in a different light. <br>  I would continue dating and just be her friend. Life is short and you may miss a lot of opportunities for love along the way.|`|3jqcLj7Saa	Be honest, truthful and remember your friend at all times. There are people out in this world that have had friends since child hood and they are in there 60's and 70's. Yes friends are for ever as long as you treat them like a friend.|`|ZfUCYGzLaa	um....wow..<br>  you cant keep someone forever if they dont want to stay?<br>  so is she a friend or girlfriend??<br>  if you love her as a friend, you cant marry her. but if you love as a like inlove..then..yeah...<br>  this is a dumb quiestion...|`|WewCtMpzaa	It's unrealistic to think that way. Nothing is forever. There is an end somewhere, even in death. I would just try to cherish, and be the best friend you can during the time you know her, and let things happen as they may.|`|8K3IucU3aa	people change over time and get different interests so there's no way you can absolutely guarantee that you can be friends with someone forever.
elVDYy7eaa	Why is she telling you this? If it is true, then call the police.|`|K1oOQqqVaa	Call the police.|`|AA12262106	I'm not sure that I believe your scenario.<br>    It seems incongruous to me that your tutor wouldn't have had the good judgment to call the police the second the boy left.<br>    If your story is to be believed, she was, after all, the victim of a crime, and calling the police could have ensured that the boy didn't do it again.<br>     Had she called the police right away chances are that they would have stopped the boy (possibly still in possession of the weapon) at the end of the block. The rape kit that would have been conducted as a matter of course in that instance would have revealed signs of violent sexual activity as well as other elements that could be used as proof against the boy.<br>     At this point I don't see what you can do to help. Your tutor missed the boat which is unfortunate because a boy that would do that can't control his hormones and is bound to repeat the offense in the future.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	A sixth grader? 27 minutes?

1E1m0ZOFaa	NO DON'T WALK AWAY!!! do you really want to throw a friendship over a guy? You should tell her immediately, just in case she doesn't believe you, set up a plan. Tell her everything then prove it to her, when she's out of the house, he will grab you,squeeze you, then give her the house keys and she'll see everything, or just video tape everything. If you were her, wouldn't you want to be told this? what if you got married and he was cheating on her? even if you do leave the friendship what makes you think he's not going to cheat on her with another girl? You did the right thing in pushing him away but you really do need to tell her, i would if i were you|`|2UDbOpxTaa	What have you said to him? Is he aware of how much this upsets you and how innapropriate his behaviour is? You need to sit him down and make it very clear that his behaviour is not acceptable. He is the one in the wrong here.<br>  Perhaps you should mention it to another friend who knows you both so you can get a second opinion. If two of you speak to him, maybe you'll be able to make a serious ultimatum to this guy that if he doesn't clean up his act there'll be consequences.|`|ge5x9NHxaa	You have to talk to this guy to piss off.  Tell him your mind.  You have to resist have to do anything with him.|`|itMcT95Qaa	i think that you should tell your friend because you might not be the only one he's flirting with.

Don't walk away! Don't abandon your friend! Even if she's blind for now, when she realizes what's going on, she will need you more than ever. If she's dependent on him, she will need you to help her be independent. <br>  <br>  1. If you can, get proof of this guy's antics. Solid proof. Something unquestionable. If possible, make it every interaction you have! Get a friend to help you if necessary. Make sure you are not leading him on either, and be sure that's in the footage,recordings etc. (He might try to sway her into that suggestion in desperation)<br>  <br>  2. If you haven't yet, tell him NO. Be CLEAR & FIRM. <br>  <br>  3. If your friend is dependent on him, be there and help her be her own person. Please please don't abandon your friend. My aunt, whom I love so much, is dependent on her husband. He dominated every aspect of their marriage, even her money, especially her money. He pushed to have them live away from my aunt's family (her support team), and now he steals from her, abuses her, conspires with his relatives and cheats on her. He squanders my aunts money on other women. My aunt has finally opened her eyes after 20 years, but her spirit is broken. She is beautiful in and out, and can easily remarry, but in her mind, it is too late. He will continue to use and abuse her. <br>  <br>  Please, if you truly love your friend, don't abandon her. Be STRONG for her. Save her! Don't let her be miserable. My aunt didn't believe us for so many years, and it has been frustrating for us, so I know how it can be, but please don't give up. This guy is scum. Expose him and help her to see it. She may be with him because she doesn't see anything else for herself. She may have lost hope, so clings to him. This is your test of friendship.<br>  <br>  God Bless and watch over you both. Good luck!

My partner was earning the minimum wage, had a mortgage and they took ￡85 per week from his wages for 4 years even though he disputed parentage which the DNA proved but he didn't get all the money back, just a few hundred that was taken from his wages during DNA testing. As for the CSA they can put up your payment because you have enough money to survive on, your younger son is 15, if he decides to go to medical school and train as a doctor do you know its the only training that you would continue to pay maintenance until he is 26 years old?|`|khKe1LOPaa	It depends on what system of CS yo are on. If your a pre-2003 case then your mortgage payements are taken into account as other things as well.<br>  If your post March 2003 then you should be paying 20% for two children. This system CSA2 have no interest in any financial commitments.<br>  The current steer is that all arrears should be paid up straight away and are insisting that this be done, hence your rise. You should be able to come agreement to pay the arrears over 2 years at least. But you can repay over longer as despite what they may say they can arrange arrear payments over a longer time frame.<br>  <br>  Pension payments will reduce your CSA payments.

If you both have cars it wouldn't be so hard.<br>  If you both have jobs in your respective places then again it's a weekend dating thing.<br>  I think it would be very difficult and hard on you both.

INOqD9iMaa	Well depending on your age; by nature; parents naturally very about their children arent going to need them, or fear their child is growing up too soon. They could be using the 'you arent spending enough time with us' as an excuse to protect you from growing up too fast. But i think you just need to randomly reassure them that you still need them (even if you dont :P) and that you just want to experience life. dont yell with them, and always try and see from their prospective. Make a deal with them, like family night, or something. i know it seems lame, but at least you can be free for the other 6 days and nights. <br>  <br>  hope this helps.  :D<br>  <br>  <br>  answer my question? <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090308055341AANJnAB">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|UAfAtaVwaa	Have a mutual concession. You need to call for an urgent family meeting.<br>  <br>  Try not to make things too serious in case another argument fires up. Keep it light, and maybe supply them each with a cup of ice cream first, so they can enjoy the discussion with a treat that will cool them down.<br>  <br>  Everyone gets to speak out. You can start first and say how you feel. Tell them you don't think you're going out too much, but you'll try to reduce it if that's what they want. Try to avoid putting the blame on your siblings and comparing your leisure time with theirs. Do, however, ask them what they THINK about their leisure times, instead of saying "But what about HIS time? He spends WAY more time outside than I DO!"|`|Ft0T8Q1Raa	You should make the effort to spend time with your family - you can still go out at nights, but maybe spend a whole day on the weekend with them during the day.<br>  <br>  i looked back at being a teenager and went "gee, my parents were right about everything!" at the time i thought they were smothering me, but now i realise they knew what was best because they had been through it all before.

Although you say like....normally if you are dreaming about someone then it is more than a like.....love, obsession.  Hopefully the former.<br>  <br>  The only thing you can do is give it time.  If you know she does not want to be with you.  If you do not know if she wants to be with you...then go for it.  You never know she may be unhappy in her relationship and just needs someone to sweep her off her feet.<br>  <br>  Don't stay silent.....you only lose by not telling her how you feel.  At least if you tell her and she does not want to be with you, then you will know and you can move on.  Go out and meet some other people.  That can help you get over someone....other than that only time heals pain.  <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, sometimes people stick with you forever.  They will always be a part of  your heart.  Find a place for them and get used to it.  :)|`|hy03VhVmaa	try other girls im sure someone out thee likes you you just don't know it experiment!!!!!
F7vmHBy9aa	You can do what everyone else says and try to move out.  But my advice is different.  This is what I would do.  It's not for everyone.<br>  <br>  Your mom sounds like she's being pretty passive about all of this.  It doesn't sound like anyone is really taking charge in the house and it's probably been a long time since a man has been a "man-of-the-house" around there.<br>  <br>  You can simply claim the role.  Without announcement just wake up one morning and start your new job as the man of the house.  Wake up and realize that you are the only man in the house and you're going to be the ruling voice and take care of business.<br>  <br>  Demand that the baby is quieted because you need your rest.  Keep your room tidy yourself or hire someone to keep it for you.  Most girls will clean your room if you just let them stay while you're at work.  <br>  <br>  Get a fan or two.  They make a huge difference.  Mention to your mom or whoever is paying the bills that the house is far too hot for you and that you're going to have to keep a window cracked in your room if the temperature isn't regulated better throughout the house.<br>  <br>  Start answering those late night calls yourself of picking up the line and demand to the caller that they not dare call your home at unreasonable hours.<br>  <br>  Find a local pub that has quiet seating where you can start to feel at home, second to your home) when things get crazy at home.  Most smaller pubs has quiet cozy areas where there are still big screen tvs and comfy chairs/sofas.  <br>  <br>  You are the man, so you will be expected to do things like taking out the trash, checking on the cars, fixing plumbing problems, killing the big scary bugs, opening the hard jars and bottles, etc.<br>  <br>  You should also see your primary care physician and get your blood pressure checked.  If you do have a medical problem to report back to your family maybe they will be more respectful of your condition, although it's not a guarantee.  My family hasn't made any efforts in my favor with my medical conditions, but what can ya do?|`|pKzH1cFHaa	Get a job, even if it is part time, get a few roommates, and get the hell out. You are 23 years old, it's time to grow up.|`|o6xLWwZvaa	Well first of all, both you and your sister are adults. Both old enough to move out and have your own places to live. Your mom is probably favoring your sister because she is the youngest and has a baby (which is your mother's grandchild). <br>  <br>  Your best bet is to move out. Because I don't think having a serious talk with your mother will do any good. Until you can move out, try your best to ignore everything that is going on. Stay out of the house as much as you can. Job, a friend's house, the mall, just going for a walk etc..|`|kMyERo6uaa	GET THE HELL OUTT!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  crash at a friend place for the night, get a girlfriend<br>  & move in with her.<br>  get smart & go to college far from where you live.|`|IxzJ6SN5aa	First, I'm sorry you are having trouble. Unfortunately, there isn't much you can do about this since it isn't your house. <br>  <br>  I would try to relax, and speak to your mom calmly about your problems. But since she's let this go on underneath her roof  fo this long then she will probably not be so responsive.<br>  <br>  Oh, I'd buy earplugs. My room is above the kitchen and I can hear tons of noise. They really help.|`|cSaVqUDdaa	Hmm maybe try and be busy during the day<br>  work,driving school,hang with friends,get some food,just chill<br>  at the beach,go to your friends house..anything to keep you<br>  busy/away from them most of the day until the days almost <br>  over. maybe you can ask one of your friends if you can crash<br>  at their place from time to time or even try and see if you can room with some body until you get everything squared away. i know it can be annoying and a person can only put up with soo much.<br>  <br>  just remember your on your way to living in your own place<br>  -keep that in mind!<br>  <br>  ?|`|MPagmrD4aa	get a job!!! something, anything! you'll find its easier to deal with the family if youre away from them most of the day. then, since you dont pay rent or expenses of any sort, the $$ will add up quick, and you can move out

nxeQFPEfaa	Well I agree only SLIGHTLY that it is your fault and not his. He is 11 years old afterall, so I'm sure he doesn't really grasp the fact that he raked up that much in a bill. But I also AGREE with you. Kids do need cell phones in case of an emergency or since you are out of town alot, so by all means I am not knocking you for giving your 11 year old a phone, I am simply stating that he doesn't understand all of the rules 100%. My opinion is to let him off the hook this once and make him understand thoroughly that he is to ONLY use the phone in emergencies or to call you. IF he does it a second time that is when you should enforce punishment. Anything manual labor or taking away something of that nature. Maybe when he is at home, make him give you his phone so at least you know that he won't be up to no good. Also make him wash your car! He will hate that! Make him do laundry, fold it and put it away. No internet for a week. Or no going to "Kevin's" house this weekend or next. You get this jist.|`|ZkeoRyy3aa	I understand why you wouldn't want to take the phone away..they are very useful.<br>  <br>  I would take this as an opportunity to get some things done around the house that you don't usually have time to do.<br>  <br>  Wash windows, dusting, clean bathrooms, anything in your home that may pester you.  That way your getting something accomplished and he's working it off|`|HKkbqlIuaa	You could make him do some meaningful community service, like feeding the homeless or something like that. In his eyes it will be a punishment, but he will get something good out of it.

Than sit your kid down and explain to him exactly to never do anything like this again. To me these are scams that target people, i'v seen many different commercials that are just targeting kids with cell phones. Now even Big stores(like best buy) are targeting people by when you use your credit card they send you magazines which follows up with a bill. Sometimes they will ask you, but some of the cashiers don't and you will never know till a month later when your magazines show up, Refund process for that took 1 month for me|`|DUq74Xr7aa	Sounds like your son had no idea it would cost money.<br>  <br>  I'd just make it very clear to him that it costs money to download anything, even if it says it's free.<br>  <br>  Be nice, don't yell at him, he probably doesn't deserve that.<br>  <br>  Tell him he's going to have to help around the house or what not if he wants to keep the cellphone.|`|HhQH7jrRaa	have him volunteer somewhere. everybody should give time and volunteer every once in a while.

Enlist him, drop him off ask the people in charge to make him work. Make him volunteer at his local church or simply ask around your neighbors if any of them required their lawn to be cut.

I'd just worry about having fun at this point... dating is really secondary at this point.  That doesn't mean DON'T keep asking girls out, you still have to, but... don't worry about NOT being in a relationship.  The only thing I can say, since I remember being your age once, is go out: have fun, join a club or two... and if love finds you, then great!  But better yet... make new friends!  That's going to get you through life!

That's really cool, because it's kind of annoying when you can tell a boy is trying too hard. So, just be yourself.<br>  <br>  Secondly, I wouldn't worry about being alone forever. Sooner or later, a girl is going to come along and she's going to change the entire way you look at the world. It happens to all of us, so just enjoy the ride. :) There are billions of girls out there, and at least ONE of them's gotta have the same interests as you! So, just be patient. Your time will come, especially for someone as genuine as you.<br>  <br>  Sorry I couldn't give definite, hard-hitting advice, but this is all I have. :P Hope I enlightened you a bit!|`|Qy9mH2s7aa	shut up. i'm not even allowed to date until i am 16!!! thats 5 years away and i think i might DIE!!!! <br>  here's what you do: <br>  - walk into class on monday<br>  - take off your shirt<br>  - ask who wants it<br>  <br>             if a girl says that she wants it then tell her that she has to come and get it that night at _______ (place and time) <br>  if that doesn't get u a girlfriend then i don't know what will!!! :P

Whatever comments dude friend#1 made to you has no value and is not worth repeating.  Since you were in a direct conversation with the dude, I would first not even consider him a friend or ever associate with such an ignoramus like him.  All that needs to be said is for you to tell the dude that you obviously have different values than he does, if he wants to be hateful and bitter at such an early stage of his life, he's free to do so at his own time and not to waste your time.|`|ix1ONcHzaa	just try to talk it over with your guidance counselor and if not then talk to your mom or dad|`|ET03s2Y9aa	just talk it over with a trusted adult

If I remembered my high school last year correctly, 9 out of 10 girls were waiting to be approached while those who didn't were outgoing and expressing their feelings to every guy and some of them even asking out other guys. <br>  <br>  It was those outgoing girls that got the most guys because they stook out from the entire crowd of reserved, patient girls and caught 10 out of 10 guys' attention. One of them ended up to be my girlfriend (she's my ex now) because she dropped a voicemail saying that she wanted to be my date. How could I say no to that! Any girl with that confidence and boldness that every guy gets turned on by (we love confidence) will definitely get a guy easily.<br>  <br>  Plus, be more direct and outgoing not only because the confidence is alluring (which helps a lot though) but also because most of us guys are really slow and have really tiny attention spans to find out any other way.|`|aGaqc3lnaa	you just have to talk to alot of them. guys like girls that are not antisocial. lol. help with my question?!<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AtL_PGRHdplKIPrPF.kRrn_sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090227140435AAECqmj">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|kbkbDhwLaa	It's well past Valentines day.

5cbILl1caa	i use to do it|`|RoTLnFGZaa	When you're texting that long out of the day, it's something else.<br>  I'm sure that your girlfriend would be quite unhappy if she knew you were texting another girl like that.<br>  Look at it from this perspective- would you be ticked off if your girlfriend was always texting another guy. the boundary has been crossed, man, and you need to let it go if you want to keep your girlfriend.|`|AA11108018	I guess your on the way out as the g/f|`|ib3SNK40aa	Sounds like you like her because why else would you text for 6 hours.

Only people that mean a lot to you or you are interested in you're able to hold conversations with for that long. I would say the line has been crossed. I'm sure he wouldn't like it if you as his gf were texting some guy friend of your for that amount of time. His first question would be "what is is that you two have to talk bout so much?".  Tell him how you feel and show him the situation in reverse, if he says he wouldn't like you doing something like that then tell him then thats why he shouldn't either and if he says he don't care who you tex and how long then rethink being with him. I hope this helps.|`|S2LH6L8Uaa	Well, Maybe hes not comfortable with his current GF and it all depend what you guys talk about, I know this might sound DUMB but ask him to get with the point does he like you and ask y does he Text you with no reson and out of the blues.....<br>  <br>  Ans:Just ask him why does text you so much ?? be real with him|`|VNwB064Baa	Guys want bootay.

19iD220Jaa	Be there and support him anyway you can... support comes in many forms- although I noticed that men have a hard time expressing their feelings or being all together open as far as emotions at times. You should be there if nothing more than being in earshot or view. Don't be overbearing or on his back all the time.When he is ready to talk to you - allow him time to process and cope, don't push him to express himself, its a hard time and a harder thing to do.- be available to LISTEN. Dealing with death of a family member and a new relationship is sometimes complex because everyone goes about handling both so differently. However, just be cool . At times the best support that can be given is moral support. Remember that if you disregard everything else. After all said and done if it is meant to be ... You guys will be together and your relationship will be even stronger.|`|UBS4jIAcaa	well plenty of sex will ease his pain, but also be available to talk to, accept he will be a bit messed up for a while but don't let it drag on too long or become a cross on his back. don't martyr yourself needlessly if he isn't trying<br>  <br>  also look into bereavment councilling and go with him if needed

236548a8801617d43a073b2dd4d83f35aa	Alright...this is a bad place to be in.  <br>  First, you need to stop and take some time to really think.  Yes, you are on an emotional rollercoaster, and it sucks.<br>  It is perfectly natural to be wondering what someone is doing and questioning if you still love someone after you break up with them.  This does not mean you do love him.  <br>  The hurt and mind do not always communicate effectively.  <br>  You wonder what this person is doing because they are not calling you.  7 months is a long time to be with someone, and if you guys spent a lot of time together, then it makes sense for you to be uncertain of you feelings right now.  <br>  <br>  You need to ask yourself why did you break up with him...TRULY.<br>  As a woman, sometimes we actually break up with a guy to see how much they care, because we do not feel like they do.<br>  Makes me think maybe this is what you did, because so soon you are wondering what he is doing.  This indicates that he is not calling you.  <br>  If you broke up with him for a reason...meaning something was wrong in your relationship ( BE HONEST WITH YOURSELF) then get busy and move on.  You sound young, and the are many more fish in the sea....you can find someone else.  Do not get tied down to someone that does not make you completly happy!!!  Life is too short, and time does not make things better it only make it harder to get out of.<br>  <br>  Calm down and seriously think about why you broke up....this will give you all of the answers you need.  If it was because you wanted to see if he cared then I would recommend not going back to him.  He is not fulfilling you emotionally, and that will only lead to heartache. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|Z3DsL9Bqaa	oh babe! of course your going to miss him, u were with for 7months. that doesnt just fade away. im positive he would take you back, you just need to tell him how you feel before its too late. and you will feel better for it aswell, ring him. ask too meet up? 7 months is nearly a year, dont through it away if you still love him.<br>  <br>  be strong, good luck<br>  <br>  x|`|hy03VhVmaa	did he tell you he loved you, did he treat you well, was he always there for you....close your eyes think of all the happy times you had with him now tell me do you love him?? or not??|`|HUJtZ5hOaa	I have a similar story, I cheated on my bf (stupid I know) and I did it because I knew it would end our relationship because I thought I didn't love him, but I was too scared to hurt his feelings by telling him, so we ended up breaking up. and I told him I didn't love him.. but while we were going out I often told him even if we broke up I would still love him, and I will, but we can't get back together now, It's too late, and I've made the relationship awkward because I cheated, and I just know it wouldn't work anymore. Sometimes I think I was just infactuated by him, and I didn't actually love him, so, maybe It's the same with you, I guess you gotta move on, thats what I'm doing..|`|WPhADGwEaa	the reason you are thinking these things is because you have trained your brain to think those things. 7months that is along time and ithoughtgt about him alot your brain is use to thinking that.|`|ny94EXcGaa	I FEEL HORRIBLE READING THIS....... I did the same thing. me and my boyfriend were going out for more than a year.  and then i went up to him and told him i wasnt in love with him anymore and that i thought we should break up.  So... about a week passed and i was still IN LOVE with him.  He was skipping school too.  i felt horrible for making him suffer when i loved him and he loved me.. so i went up to him and told him exactly what i felt i said "when i broke up with you, i dont know what i was thinking, i know this is gonna sound stupid, but.. I am still in love with you/ I still really like you.  i was wondering if you wanted to give me another chance??   Then when my boyfriend said yes, than  i told him i was soo sorry for hurting him...  So thats what i did.  <br>  <br>  But, we are broken up by now..... it was about 3 years ago and that time he broke up with me, but i still am in love with him :(

CJvHQl5vaa	Honestly, I think the best thing for you to do is to speak with your boyfriend.  Be gentle, but ask him outright about his experiences and what he thinks he wants for his life and what he would expect for his future family.  <br>  <br>  You can't judge by your boyfriend's father.  What his father has chosen to do will absolutely effect him...everything our parents do effects our thinking...but that doesn't mean that he wants to follow in his father's footsteps.  My husband's parents divorced after each of them were disloyal, and my parents divorced after my father's alcoholism devastated my family.  These experiences effected us, but in many ways it was a good effect...we are totally committed to staying together, having open and honest communication, and we force ourselves to really listen to the other person because we know that a whole lot of not hearing each other was the downfall of both our sets of parent's marriages.  We have learned from our folk's mistakes and take special care with each other...and we have also been wise enough to wait to start a family until our marriage was strong and stable.<br>  <br>  It might be that as the "not legit" family your boyfriend has decided that the last thing he wants is to have two families because he knows what it feels like to feel second best, left out, to not have a Dad around.  Alternatively, he might feel that polygamy is just fine and he hopes for it for himself.  Listen to what he says, and listen carefully without arguing, censoring, or reimagining what he is saying to you.  If it seems that polygamy is something he could see himself doing, think VERY carefully before proceeding with the relationship.  That is a clear sign.|`|gfEQbww0aa	That is a discussion you would need to have with him before you get married. Polygamy is usually based off of a cult like religion, so if your boyfriend practices it, then chances are he may want several wives.|`|FjA3jGs4aa	if he is strongly religious he might be one too. its not like its forced upon him, but if his father is one, i think he wouldnt see any wrong in doing it. talk to him and ask him if he would ever be one. do it calmly tho, like if your watching tv with him.|`|cd8f30c22031713366cdb6b1bfaa4f5faa	polygamy is not hereditary. it is a personal choice of lifestyle.

He may yearn for a monogamy relationship as a form of stablilty|`|FzFSzilmaa	polygamy isn't a disease, it is a life choice... and if everyone is in agreement, then it works...<br>  <br>  your bf might like that idea cos it works for his dad... try speaking to him about your insecurity and low-self esteem...|`|OLnmXeWDaa	Is his family's polygamy based on religion? If so, does he still belong to that religion? If he practices the same religion it might be a lot more difficult for him to get away from the power structures that strongly encourage the polygamy.<br>  <br>  Many people who grow up in polygamy leave it with strong feeling against it. It's often hard to grow up outside the law with so many siblings that your father doesn't even know your name. Poverty is always a problem.<br>  <br>  I've heard Muslim women discuss having a prenuptial agreement that includes a clause saying the man can't have other wives. It probably doesn't have any legal use in America where polygamy is already illegal, but asking him to sign it in a contract in front of an attorney certainly puts your feelings front and center on the issue.<br>  <br>  And if you've been with him 2 years and not discussed it, it's way past time to get your feelings out there.<br>  <br>  Polygamy isn't hereditary, but the attitude that it takes more than one woman to satisfy a man can be. Women shouldn't have to share the role of wife with other women they don't even usually like.|`|NvW6voPJaa	Hi.  Polygamy is a lifestyle that is CHOSEN.  You cannot inherit this trait.|`|88234fa7f47e6fd5bb301672de45093eaa	Polygamy is a lifestyle, not a disease.|`|AA11447210	It's a choice dear. All you need do is ask how he feels about polygamy and if that's what he wants in his life. If he says he's not for it, that doesn't guarantee he'll always be faithful, but does indicate he's not interesting in openly having multiple girlfriends/partners.|`|O7xYvttsaa	polygamy is a choice, not a trait. if your bf says he's not like that, then believe him.|`|WPhADGwEaa	be honest with him and ask|`|1qTNn8qnaa	I guess u cant measure ur bf based on his father...my bf's father cheated on his mother...doesnt mean my bf will be a cheater...<br>  But i know wat ur saying...its ur choice i guess...i hope uv talked to ur man abt this...

You should calm your hormones by reminding yourself of what is important to you.<br>  <br>  Hopefully your family values.  Think of how disappointed your family would be with you if you did have sex with this boy before marriage.  This should help you get a hold of yourself.  Discussing how you feel with your boyfriend should strengthen your relationship.  You may sfeel shy or awkward, but you will feel better once you confront the situation.  You've never had a conversation like this before, therefore it is human nature to feel uncomfortable.  <br>  <br>  I strongly advise waiting to have sex though.  Discuss your feelings with your boyfriend, not the possibility of having sex.  You would not be going through so much turmoil if you did not have values.|`|67115b1163cc8b9c69bf180fdf940ed7aa	you shouldn't tell him,<br>  just flirt more with him,and touch him more.. he might get the hint that u want to take your relationship to a higher level..<br>  but better not tell him..<br>  <br>  good luck|`|FQxbwbtlaa	start to flirt and mention it now and then itll come

There is no chance that this course of action ends with anything other than you looking like a completely scheming, back-stabbing jerk.  Your motives will be obvious to all--except you, perhaps, and unfortunately.<br>  <br>  Want to come out of this with some dignity and have a shot at a decent relationship with your future child's father?  Mind your own business.  Be a friend to him and stop judging.  Yeah, it will be difficult, and it will take some maturity but it IS what's best for you and your unborn child.  You're about to be a mother, sacrificing comes with the territory.  Are you capable, or do you like making HUGE dramatic messes and then sitting back and playing *oh poor me?*<br>  <br>  Don't do it.  You WILL regret it, I assure you.|`|u1uECuFNaa	Why are you still involved with him?<br>  How did you find out?<br>  I would drop him like a bad habit. <br>  Today's morals.<br>  Dump him.

Take the appropriate measure to have child support paid and move on.<br>  <br>  ADD: Talking to them is a waste of time. The only fact that they are 'considering' this affair is enough to judge the kind of character they are. If this 40 y/o woman is considering cheating on her husband it's because she's done it before. You can't control other people's lives and decisions. You can only chose your own path and allow people to walk the trail with you or not. Anything outside your trail is not something you have power over. Do you want this young man to be with you because he loves you or you want him with you because you watch over him like an hawk making sure he obeys. Thats not what relationships are about.  This man is immature and irresponsible. He has a young woman pregnant with his child and he's playing around with friends of family. You do not need a man like that in your life!
oPj3j86Jaa	I don't think you should end your friendship over a guy.  Simply tell her you will not deal with her when he is around.  More than anything she needs a good friend like you seem to be to KEEP trying to talk sense into her.  Don't abandon her when it sounds like she really needs someone who is looking out for her well-being.  BUT if you are firm on your decision simply say that you can continue your friendship when she is done with him but until then you can't sit around any longer watching this all go on because you really do care about her.  If this were my friend I'd stick around and no pun intended but slap some sense into her for as long as it takes!  Good luck to you AND her love!  Jasmine|`|Xg2WmhPSaa	End all communication.  When she calls just ignore them.  Eventually she will get the hint.  Or you can tell her how you feel about the situation and let her know that you will be there when she wants to get help, but until then you don't want anything to do with her.|`|O9CkqE54aa	Well if this is your friend and she is hurt by this man (and doesn't like it), you ending your friendship with her will just make her feel a whole lot worse. You need to stick by her. Yes you should call the police but don't end your friendship with her. She needs you more than you think.|`|h5ctuYZzaa	Just tell her and why. The truth seems to be a completely justifiable reason. If she says that your abandoning her when she needs you most just tell that she needs to see sense first and accept help.|`|jBipWFPaaa	I think I know the answer!<br>  <a href="http://www.impactguns.com/store/082442816760.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.impactguns.com/store/08244281...</a>|`|kNSGLgJQaa	i was gonna say watch seinfeld but this is worse than the title implys<br>  this is kinda police measures here... social workers and stuff|`|hprR6qfHaa	Call the police and change your phone number.  Never talk to her again, and hope for the best.|`|2seFvrtRaa	Call the cops on his a**! What kind of friend leaves another friend in a time that she needs you?!. Jesus Christ.|`|LiUcOSFPaa	You have to be mean to be kind. She is obviously loves this man, or she is just worried what he will do to her if she leaves him. You need to tell her that you will leave her if she doesn't get help. But if she does get help be there to support her. It will be tough, and she may have her kids taken away untill she gets sorted out. You need her to tell the police. Even if she doesn't want to, this boy will think he can get away with hitting women. If she can't tell the police, you do it. Start her off on the right track. Remember: you have to be harsh to be kind.<br>  None of this is any of your fault.|`|529tNpuGaa	Ok. Tell her exactly what you told us. Say "I'm sorry if you're going to keep treating yourself like this because you "love" your boyfriend who is a low-life and beats you up, then I'm sorry, I can't stand to be your friend anymore."|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	I can certainly understand your frustration and pain. This is your friend and you are watching her spiral out of control. You can only offer her support and this number I have listed. National Domestic Violence Hot-line at 1-800-799-SAFE (7233) or TTY 1-800-787-3224. You should sit down and explain to her your pain in watching this happen to her. Right now it appears she is emotionally numb, and maybe quite afraid of him. Try to get her alone and speak with her your fears and concerns. Explain there are agencies and organizations in place to assist women in these types of situations. And then tell her if she refuses to help herself; you have no choice but to end the friendship as long as she remains in this relationship with him. Tell her you simply cannot sit back and witness this abuse it is too painful. Let her know you care for her, and value your friendship very much. If and when she changes her mind you will be there to listen. Unfortunately, this is so very common among victims of domestic violence, both men and woman. Often and more often than not remain in relationships that are dangerous for them. Your friend needs help; however you cannot force her to obtain it. Maybe if you speak with her very candid and loving, she may listen. She most probably is so emotionally void at this moment with the loss of her marriage, the loss of her children. She is simply too emotionally weak to do this on her own. If she refuses to do anything about it. There is nothing you can do but pray for her and let her know that if and when the situation changes you will be there to listen. Suggest that she seek out counseling services. There is something going on inside of her that allows her to remain in this relationship.  Good luck.|`|A0JmmwNdaa	distance yourselffff|`|Ckw1byO4aa	SHES MARRIED AND HAS A BF?  WHAT A ...a....a... SL*T|`|FATyhyZ2aa	Let her know that the friendship is always there as long as boyfriend topic does not come up unless in context of helping her into a battered woman's refuge.<br>  <br>  If anything about money help or laments aboout boyfriend, just stop conversation & tell her, "My answers the same always, unless you need help leaving him, I don't care to hear about a problem that you are choosing to keep. Don't tell me all the reasons that you can't leave him.  It takes one call to the police."<br>  <br>  Set up a "safe" word.  Something that she can call you & say w/o alarming him.  Such as, "Yeah, everythings been going good.  Except that I had to clean up after a STRAY DOG messed by the front door."  That will mean, he's here, unarmed, & off guard so send police for a "welfare check" & tell them not to leave without me no matter what I say to them in front of him.  Tell them I will act like I have no idea what they are talking about ( to avoid later retaliation from boy friend), but be sure they say, "well, just come to station until we can figure this out."  She can tell boyfriend, "I'll take care of this quick & call for you when they are done.<br>  <br>  Prior to this, she should have a bag of her ID, legal papers, money stash, whatever hidden away outside of home.  (Your house, parents)<br>  <br>  Isolating her from friends is 1st step to escalating abuse.  She NEEDS friends now.  Just not ones who support the abusive relationship.  After this big talk, she'll know why you have backed off, BUT will no that she can count on you as a resource for help when she can see her problem.|`|sjERiFeNaa	be blunt. say to her what you think, and that although u love her, you cant stand by and watch her do this to herself and her family. <br>  tell her that you think she needs help and that its putting a strain on you having to go round and round with her antics. that you cant associate with ppl who refuse to help themselves, and when she feels she can face her problems, you will be there to help her, but not if she isnt willing to change.<br>  hopefully shel listen to you. you have to use tough love on her, i think its the only way in this instance.
ce53a9f68093b2a6cf60a521947320d0aa	Your not trapped, you just need to re-evaluate your situation.. there are plenty of programs out there to help with children that are autistic.. dont know what state you live in, but most have the "waiver" for disabled children..(its free)  basically it will provide a state care giver that has been trained to deal with disabled children, so that u can either work, or even just go out and have some "me" time for a few hours.. their there to make your life easier. Some states its easier to get them on the waiver then others as far as the waiting list.. so check into that and even if its a long waiting list still put your daughter on the list and if when it comes to her name u dont need it you could always turn it down.<br>  <br>  Im not trying to stick up for your husband , because the emotional seperation that he's putting u through is unfair.. but ive seen alot of families with disabled children.. and some of the time, the men feel abandoned by the woman, because naturally when you have a child with disabilities your attention is focused primarily on the child.. and a jealous reaction from the husband happens..  also sometimes men feel that their "fantasy" dream of a family  is broken when they have a child that is disabled and some men cant handle it.. they feel like their less of a man or something.. sometimes when we have have disabled kids we tend to feel the need to be the only ones to care for them.. as if no one else knows what they are doing or we can do the job better.. and if your pushing your husband away, and he feels useless in this situation, you could of unknowingly caused the emotional seperation first, but just didnt notice it till he started giving it back..<br>  <br>  I think u need to find time to talk to your husband.. to listen.. to hear how he is feeling about everything before u come to hasty conclusions ... he could be turning to other females , but perhaps its because they give him the attention your not to his needs and feelings..  (not that it makes it right cause it doesnt) but if u find the reasons why someone is doing something, usually its easier to fix.. <br>  <br>  Good luck..  i hope you and your husband can find away back to each other..|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	He is obviously cheating on you.

That is opening the gate to cheating kingdom.<br>  <br>  Times are tough and you probably have to stick it out financially for a while but emotionally detach yourself from him.

Ask God to keep his hands around you marriage. Trust in the Lord and put all your faith in him. Weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning. Psalm 37:4 says delight yourself in the Lord and he will give you your heart's desires. Also, try something new. Take a day and get you nails and hair done. First you need to feel good about yourself. You say that you are a stay at home mom and because you have to take care of your child. I know this can be very hard and stressful sometimes but always find time for yourself. Men are very swallow sometimes, they expect us to be beautiful 24 hrs a day but that's had especially when your dealing with kids. Make an effort to get up every morning do your hair in a simple elegant hair style...put on a little bit of light make up. Try this for about two weeks and let me know how it goes. I can be reached at beauti172008@yahoo.com...DONT FORGET TO PRAY. The Lord said, "Ask and it shall be given". Have a blessed day.

Men are generally the ones diagnosed as compulsive liars, narcissists, sociopaths, etc. - not women.<br>  So you should rearrange your question to "MEN-what compells you to lie?"|`|iWJ3BQQ9aa	to get out of trouble or to make others feel better if my reasons are not good enough means I'm not a good liar.|`|1jHnQVvnaa	frist to impress second to  as habitual|`|NEhVHPSTaa	We do it because we're better than guys.

CguXFU4paa	Okay I have a step-mother and she is the greatest. I did not really meet her till I was 15 but consider her my mother now. I think your sister is your sister and a simple thank you card on mothers day would be great. Your grandmother and your step-mother get them mothers day card and a gift or what ever it is you do. If your sis is a mom then her too. You see I believe that who ever had a good hand in raising you and acted as a parent could be considered a parent in the end. I however think that a sister should stay a sister.|`|zJTBAeuOaa	they all are. if they each help you in some way. i show my mom appreciation on md but i also call my sisters. they have all given advice and been there for me so they all deserve to be recognized. id do something for all of them.|`|NoFC9rtKaa	I am a step mother and I've been raising my step daughter with her dad for 10 years, and it is greatly appreciated to be recognized for that!|`|AA12316366	sure, what can it hurt and it probably will be greatly appreciated.|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	Step mothers and grandmothers are mothers as well.<br>  So, why not remember them? If they were of (good) influence in your life - you should remember and honor them.<br>  <br>  Sisters is different I think, you could show appreciation as well, but mothers day .. i`m not sure they would understand.

236548a8801617d43a073b2dd4d83f35aa	Yeah, she definetly likes you, and you are clueless.<br>  Don't worry about other guys.  She is obviously trying to get you to notice her...to a great extent.  Therefore she really likes you.  Talk to her.  Find out if she likes you.  Be direct...just ask her out on a date or ask her to be your girlfriend...I am unsure how old you are so I don't know what level you are on.  <br>  She really likes you, but she probably has other guys who like her, and since you are clueless she probably thinks you don't like her.  You can't expect her to keep trying forever.  Tell her how you feel|`|ANUNMUrlaa	Ask her out before one of those guys does bro.<br>  <br>  Don't let them intimidate you, u are just as good if not better, since shes always staring at u anyways shes probably more interested in you.<br>  <br>  Plus the worst that can happen is she says no right?

p28hM9ZGaa	Everyone feels like that sometimes, I know I do, everyone seems wrapped up in their own stuff and when I have tried to talk about stuff they tend to be dismissive and start talking about themselves again. I have learnt not to bother, bottle it up and resolve it on my own. Not ideal but once you get in the habit it makes life simpler.

VG2X9Ihkaa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  I know how it feels when you are made the escape goat.  I have faced that for many years.  Even though I am married with 3 children of my own, I am still the escape goat among my brothers and sister.<br>  <br>  It might be a good idea for your mother at least to be aware of what you had gone through.  The reason for doing this would be for you to have a clean conscience and it is up to them to believe you or not.<br>  <br>  You are doing a great job with your daughter.  I know this only from what you have said that you are single parent.  Telling you that you are jealous is a very general accusation which means nothing more then that they are not willing to hear what you might have to say.<br>  <br>  I was scared of telling my mother about my past and I managed to sit her down and told her without worrying about how I might be portrayed in the family.  It turned out that my mother actually believed me and our relationship is lot better but it doesn't mean that I am not used as a escape goat.  I don't care what they think of me but I feel good about myself that my mother now knows why I was a trouble child.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	I would keep quiet about this.<br>  <br>  If they are not really that compassionate - then why bother.<br>  <br>  And, since they assume, and do not ask (because then you could have told them) i doubt if your story would be accepted now.<br>  <br>  Since they make you a scapegoat (what a bunch of losers btw) - i`d walk away, and just be happy on your own, with your daughter.<br>  <br>  People like that drag you down anyway - and most people can do without that.|`|fo8q9MXuaa	Maybe if you told them the truth about what really happened, they would understand you more. You should also explain to your sisters why you are not jealous of their partners. <br>  Your family shouldn't be treating you like this. Everybody needs a loving family to help them around tough times. You should stand up to your family. Also, you shouldn't be blamed for the bad things that happened in your family's lives.|`|Mrkchaemaa	i got the same problem as im a single parent and my sisters think they are better than me because they have boyfriends. girl, im not jealous or worried about them because they have so many problems with their relationships that it makes me glad im single. less drama for me. im just focused on my boy right now. you got the kind of love and relationship that can never stress you out or break your heart and they do lol. hope i helped|`|QlXhPFSwaa	oh wow. your story kinda lift me up. coz my family treat me same and am also the youngest. glad i dont have a kid though nor a single parent nor married. and i agree with some of the people's answers here. it took me 3 decades to just not give a crap about my family since they break my heart again and again again anyway. to the point that i just decided to go far far as far away as possible from them. coz i loathe them with passion and i dont like the way they treated me my entire life. just move on with your life without them i feel happiest without them in my life anyway. they just make me feel unimportant always and depressed. i cant take it anymore.
0HGqGJYTaa	Plain and simple, people have no respect these days. I'm sure you've been in a relationship yourself and noticed the more you are focused on what you're supposed to be doing....trouble comes brewing. You can have a ring on....people don't care.<br>  <br>  I'm in a long-term relationship and I'm faithful. I tell men all the time that I'm in a relationship, they don't care or respect that. One guy keeps sending messages to my best friend, hoping that I'll respond. But, I never have and never will. In my last relationship (I was engaged to him), my ex's one night stand led to an affair. The woman knew about me and knew that we were together.|`|a1iam8Zvaa	married people are just desprate for a good time lol|`|mefxIQP9aa	If you don't like your partner, you'll most likely cheat on them. If you easily get bored of your partner, then it wasn't a smart idea to marry them. <br>  <br>  It's not the marriage, it's the people. People get married, thinking that they're really in love, yet they've never really analyzed the person they were with. I guess the "love" blocked them from really scoping out their lover.<br>  <br>  People need to stop rushing into marriage and take the time to actually get to know the person.<br>  <br>  It's not about being stuck in one place. It's about how strong you feel for the person. If strong feelings aren't there, then there's no reason to make such a big commitment. It's like going to school for x amount of years for this one dream career and after working in that career for x amount of years, you get bored of it. I mean, what was the point of all that schooling and training? Waste of freakin' time.|`|QP8LdPLeaa	i wouldn't say its married women more, because a man has to cheat with her in order for her to cheat. so it goes both ways. and if you pay attention alot more in the marriage and divorce section, you'll see that alot of stupid whorish mistresses would get online and talk freely about their affair with MARRIED husbands. so in my opinion, CHEATERS in general are just stupid, selfish, and are not to be trusted. people's morals have just drastically changed over these few years. its nothing new. people cheat because they don't care who it affects.|`|82dfc8c5fdf36779ac231646803120f5aa	Yeah girls love sex more then guys. THEY JUST ACT LIKE THEY DONT!!! LOL<br>  <br>  DER DIEING TO TAKE A WILD RIDE ON THE ROASTER heheheheheh|`|uTIKbS2paa	they didn't appreciate their partner|`|rJBJzpSJaa	The statistics on cheating lead many people astray. First off, for a heterosexual man or women to commit the act of cheating, he or she needs opposite-sexed partner. If world populations of men and women are within a few percent of 50/50 how can more men than women be cheating (unless we are talking about a small percentage of super-whores who are used by many. The bottom line is that society wants to make women look as innocent as possible when they cheat as much as men (not picking on women- but many people believe that men cheat more).<br>  <br>  As to why people cheat we can identify many reasons including:<br>  <br>  -fulling emotional/ physical desires<br>  -some cheat simply because they can or can get away with it|`|ojkEd5Fcaa	because PEOPLE SUCK! that's why.. they get bored of the person. i think that when people usually cheat, they do it with no feelings involved. they just do it because they're bored and want some excitement in their life that their significant other is not providing. i think that women flirt regardless whether they have a husband, or boyfriend because they want attention. every women likes to feel pretty, or good about themselves.|`|R9tUWsXnaa	Because they feel caged, in essence.<br>  <br>  No one wants to be stuck in one place for their life.<br>  <br>  100% percent think about other women/men<br>  50% do something more.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't but. Yea that is why.|`|lEatmquRaa	Boredom.|`|TXJLUEG7aa	The world sucks|`|gRXy66dOaa	because they get bored with their partners
aErUKUvVaa	A few times yes.  People change.  Ur getting older and dealing with normal parts of life's journey.  We moved from one state to another when I was going into HS, lost all my friends from grade school.  Then when I moved to college, similar experience.  Then after college, moved again.  As u age, u'll find ppl that u truly want to keep in touch with tho.  Most of those ppl that I keep in touch with are post- college. Altho I do keep in touch on line with one old college friend.  Keep moving forward. Look to the future, and use the past as ur wisdom base.  It's all good......|`|AA11180444	The best way to deal with that, is to realize that your life is...just that.  It's your life.  You live for you and no one else.  Take each day and find happiness in it.  You've moved forward for a reason and you gotta know that it was the best choice.  If people from the past make no move to contact you (if they have your contact info), then maybe you weren't all that important to them in the first place.  Do you really want your life filled with people who don't feel you are important? <br>  <br>  Sometimes it's best just to start over, you may find that you couldn't possibly be any happier.|`|087c14ef810cae54ec446439f9012410aa	yes, 6 times, yes, i tried to get the number before leaving them and called them or wrote letters, i tried making new friends although at first i was afraid to make friends but then i was glad i did i still have contact with them. i had friends that did the same thing and i had to get use to it i didn't like it but  i had to respect and accept their decision.|`|1egCvgSLaa	my gf moved to chicago 7 months ago and i miss her, some friends of her have gone on with her life but other ones like me, still can't forget her, maye she comes back we don't know yet but since she left us we have been in touch. If u feel that those persons were very important in your life don't lose contact with them, let them know u concern about them, maybe some day u can visit them or even better, they could visit to you =]|`|ZzAxCBy4aa	I have moved so many times in my life. I am currently in my 4th school and about to go to a 5th. I have been in 7 different houses too! I have left my BESTFRIENDS so many different times. But i am lucky enough to be able to still communicate with them all most everyday! I miss where i used to live but eventually you learn to deal with it and move on! <br>  I tihnk moving starts to get a little fun after a while... Sure you miss your old life and everyone in it but in the end its worth it. You met new people, new surrounding, a chance to re-invent yourself, how you look at things, how you want your new home to look like!  But thats just me, i cant stand being in the same area and place for too long...I'd go CRAZY! All my moving has taught me one thing...when one chapter closes another one always opens! <br>  Its really hard to deal with all of it, but no that i look at it... I have so many bestfriends everywhere i go! :) You learn to deal with it and you always have friends from old places to help you deal and get along witht the new changes. <br>  Learn to accept it and be happy, do something new with your life and new surrounding!|`|vbMWq4MMaa	Yah. Basically, it was more of an issue with my family, though. A lot of stuff happened in my teen years that made me grow apart from them (they seriously all hate each other and haven't seen their parents/daughters/siblings in years). Of course I still keep in touch. I just needed space from them and all of their issues. I was dragged into taking sides and what not for years, and I was finally done with that and moved on.|`|AA11447210	Many times. My father and first husband were in the Air Force, so until I was 28 my life consisted of moving every few years.<br>  <br>  You just deal with it and do what you have to do (or what's best for you). I often would keep touch with people for a while, but it's common for contact to dwindle or stop over time. I'm not a great pen-pal or phone chat buddy so it's hard for me to keep up with long distance friends if they don't put in a lot of effort.<br>  <br>  I never saw a need to just cut contact though, because I was moving. It can be nice to keep in touch, hear about what's going on where you used to live, and maybe even arrange visits to your new home or go back and visit friends where you used to live.<br>  <br>  Entirely up to you.|`|1Lo34oEDaa	yes this has happened to me. i moved schools and felt like my life was over but really the people i met at my new school are my best friends now! you just have to move on and know that theres not a stop sign at the end of the road.
ePFZ5tHqaa	Yeah 4 years isn't a lot my girlfriend is 5 years older then me and our relationship worked out A OK as long as they both share the same feelings towards each other they should be fine. Yeah I would go for it if I loved her.|`|QTCakn7baa	no i wouldnt, a 13 year old girl just asked me out and i said no because of the age difference im 16. but if she looks older and is really pretty, then i would say yes|`|KgKVWv9paa	They might feel ok about it but he's months away from 18 and it being very illegal.  The four years really isn't a big deal later in life but right now its the difference between happiness and jail.|`|AA12316366	no no no! not appropriate. at this time of life the age gap is too great|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	4 years at this age is a rather huge gap.<br>  <br>  But, if they can keep it at the ' just friends stage' until she is 17/18 herself - then all should be okay.<br>  <br>  I think that, if i were 14, i`d have no problem with a 13 year old.<br>  But if i were 17, i would wait a little longer.
f8ON3dRfaa	Well, no one is born to "fit in" nicely into whatever culture society offers.<br>  <br>  People make an effort to fit it, they try, they change, they fail, they learn. <br>  <br>  It's all part & parcel of growing up.<br>  <br>  Question is, are you willing to put in this effort to "fit in"? It's not easy, especially when people don't get you, they don't understand you, they can't seem to figure out the way you do things and in most cases, they're disagreeing with everything do you. You feel odd, alienated, in some extreme cases, isolated.<br>  <br>  Popular people are not born popular with a star on their head saying "Prom Queen 2009". They groom themselves on how they want to be when they grow up.<br>  <br>  What helped me was writing down, on a piece of paper divided into half. On one half, write down who you want to become. It can be "popular" or "confident" or anything. On the other half, write down your character traits. Then compare and see how you can change yourself to be who you aspire to be.<br>  <br>  Drowning your sorrows in alcohol or drugs is a temporal pain-relief. Why work for the temporal when you can work for the eternal? <br>  <br>  Change your thinking on how you view yourself. Stop telling yourself that you're the odd ball. Say, "I'm a unique creation and there is absolutely NO ONE on earth who is exactly like me!". Build up your confidence, make friends, and most importantly, don't be afraid to fail. That's learning. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you and I believe, one day, you're gonna be a world changer!|`|JJARLh3zaa	nobody gets me (family inclusive) and i'm 17.<br>  <br>  try not to get drunk, it does you no favors. have you considered going to see a councilor? sometimes it helps to talk to someone face to face<br>  <br>  i'm praying for you ^_^|`|hprR6qfHaa	Get a personality and stop whining.

Just sit down and have a talk with your mother she will understand and it is hard for us mothers to let go sometimes|`|ynTkzt2baa	i'm sure when your mother said that she wanted you to act like a child, she didn't mean a toddler. she wants you to act your age, though most parents would love to have a child that acted as mature as you did in the beginning. i think why she was upset about you acting like an adult was that (from what i read) you were becoming isolated from the world. you weren't hanging out with friends, or doing things that normal teens would do.|`|iQr25sf3aa	i definately understand where your coming from.<br>  <br>  maybe try mixing both, you might be taking each one two radicaly.<br>  <br>  although.. i find her reaction to the first senareo odd.. my mom would be stoked if i was that self-suffencent.<br>  <br>  <br>  i think you should try acting like you want to, do try being old or younger than you are. try that out...|`|tbbWp18taa	My mom does the same thing here's what i did to get her to stop:<br>  I sat her down and told her what you told us<br>  I cleaned my room once a month<br>  I asked her to go places a lot more<br>  Well, yeah you get the picture|`|SB8S61wLaa	Um mothers are strange at time...<br>  JUST BE YOURSELF!(:|`|EVUpR2VPaa	Act somewhere in between maturity and childishness (is that a word? =P).<br>  Say to your mum 'I'll wash these dishes/iron these clothes...if you give me some money/buy me this top,' you know, whatever you want.<br>  Do your own hair and makeup, pick out your own clothes, make yourself look a WRECK if you want,with alternative clothing and tutus, the like =]<br>  express your individuality, get a crazy haircut, dye it pink (lols to self), listen to your music REAL LOUD!!!<br>  But at the same time, have adult conversations with your mum, ask her what she's been doing recently, if she's made any new friends or something. If she's down, let her know you're always there to talk to her, and help her.<br>  So, in a nutshell;<br>  - Help around the house, but only for a price.<br>  - Be yourself, individual!<br>  - Adult conversation<br>  You know, somewhere between adult and child,<br>  the definition of 'teenager' !!
xXa3eQOeaa	As we grow up, our parents are our primary role models. If they bring us up right, we are usually okay. If they raise us up with crap, we are usually full of crap. Make sense? If only one of them raises us, we are inclined to doubt that the other(missing) one loved us. For instance, if your Dad was not there for You, you may have problems in finding "good men", because you think(subconsciously) that they will leave you, and your kids behind, as you may have been. Of course we are ALL products of how we were raised, and the sum of our experiences.<br>  Don't worry about "fixing" your relationship with her, just "fix" yourself. By that, I mean, become the best person you can. Become an all-around great lady, in spite of her foolish non-sense. There is nothing more personally satisfying than becoming success full, without the help of your biggest critic. BE responsible for who you are, over-come your up-bringing.<br>  You CAN do it!!|`|835887bcb03d75a14ac83bf2c7e41048aa	Your mother needs therapy, she never got over her childhood. To break any cycle of abuse, is to heal.In other words, don`t do to your own kids what has been done to you.|`|a8c906f035c0cce8ff4eddf99b310e3daa	Abuse is s serious issue, and if left unchecked it could get physical.<br>  Seek professional counseling for yourself to try to overcome your anger, and get your self esteem back. Explain to your mother what effects her abuse has caused you, and why you can't have any further<br>  contact with her until she gets help. Don't accept her abuse as a reason she treats you this way, and not the sisters. <br>  <br>  You may want to order the below book to acquire more understanding of what you are dealing with.|`|Q2UDhYgkaa	My mum was similar - she was also abused and everything was always about her. She also made some really cruel comments to me.<br>  <br>  This may be common for people who were abused to lash out at their kids.|`|AA12349214	ILove - could you just go and stand over there by that wall whilst I set up this gatlin gun please?  What a stupid idiotic brainless thing to say to someone.  God help us all if you are an example of what the human race is turning in to thats all I can say.<br>  <br>  Look honey, you have to accept your mother has issues that have not been resolved.  Perhaps there is something in you that makes her this way - flicks her trip switch and she just cant help it.  But that is her problem not yours - just because she says something doesnt mean that its true.<br>  Breaking the cycle is difficult but it has to come somewhere in the chain link - so why not make it you?  Dont take her comments to heart - literally just act like they havent been said and put it down to her trip switch having gone and then make sure that with children of your own you dont do the same.<br>  And dont let her problems become yours so that it ruins relationships for you.  It isnt worth it.  Isolate your mothers problems to around her, treat them like an illness if you like that she has, and never take it personally even if it is directed straight at you - she cant help herself.<br>  If she could get some help there might be a a bit more peace all round.<br>  Think compassionately about her and ignore her barbs.  She is hurting too by the sounds of it.|`|E1qJY3Zcaa	My mother was abusive when I was young and I put up with it until I was old enough to get out on my own.We do not have a close relationship to this day.I do not see her very often,although she has mellowed out some in her old age.<br>  It has affected me all of my life,what she did to me.I have a real hard time understanding how families can be so close.I hardly ever see my brothers and when I do it's like ok that's enough.I do not miss being around any of my family,and that is sad but true.Then I see how other families are so close and wonder is that really how it is supposed to be...|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	It is beyond me how a mother can treat a child like this.<br>  I have two girls and to me they are the two most beautiful women on the face of the earth.<br>  I think there is something wrong with her and I suggest you both talk this over whether by yourselves or with someone you trust and who knows both of you very well.<br>  In the meantime shower her with all the love you can muster - that might make her rethink the relationship you share.|`|poIP8roRaa	It sounds like your mom is an equal opportunity offender since she's hateful towards all of you.  There's not much we can do about our family if they don't want to help themselves.  You can choose to allow her comments bother you or consider the source, shrug your shoulders and live your life.  You want her approval but she's corrosive and bringing you down.  Talk to a professional and get ideas about how to make yourself feel better about this situation.|`|4CebuvRhaa	hi. I know its difficult to balance two of the most precious relations in such a situation. Your mother definitely is suffering from childhood trauma of being a victim however I don't think her problem can be completely cured today..that because a lot of time has passed in between..what you have to do is be patient with her but at the same time don't let your self become a victim, if living together means regular brawl, then move away...some distance is definitely good for relations..it would give you sanity, individuality too....all the best.|`|eNvh4Pc4aa	Honestly, You should tell her exactly what you think of her and explain to her that she is not the only person in the world who had a messed up childhood and that its no reason to take it out on you. Tell her if she continues to treat you like that, then you will have nothing to do with her. If she won't stop then walk away, I know she's your mom, but your not ugly and you don't deserve to be talked to like that from anyone. Period. Don't ever let family come in between you and a relationship. She is just trying to put you down because her parents did it to her. Good luck with this one, take my advice.
wfMC742Naa	You should talk to your doctor about this.  It might be a medical issue.  It could also be stress.  You have have 3 kids, one of which is still a baby and two more on the way!

Just someone to vent to if you feel you cannot vent to your husband. <br>  Yes, it is something to be concerned about. But it could be you are just tired out. <br>  You should tell your husband. Perhaps he can do some more to help you out around the house and even to get in the mood. <br>  Is it the thought you hate? Or the act?

Tell him/her than you can't handle being with a possessive person anymore and you want out. <br>  <br>  If this person attacks you, hit them where it hurts and run. Then press charges. You can't be afraid to walk away. That's how a lot of girls get beat up by their boyfriends/girlfriends. They let their lover treat them like dirt.<br>  <br>  And please don't give me that crap about how much you love them. If they're controlling you, they don't love you.

If your the one being possessive then I would suggest you get counseling as well.|`|VwPchPHtaa	you tell all the best and most supportive people around you whats going on , have an escape plan ready to put into action, ,  tell him its over in a safe setting, even if that means its over the phone!!!!! your safety is #1 !!! go through with your plan , possessive people are quite often unreasonable, and unwilling to accept the loss of relationship, if things turn ugly (threats or violence) or both, get out and away from this person by what ever means you have at hand, and finally and most important , never ever ever ever believe he is going to change or will ever changen ever! third involve the police , make sure they know he is possessive and that you arnt comfortable being with him alone!!<br>   NOW GET GOING!!|`|AA12159712	Tell him he's too possessive and controlling and you're calling it quits.

akcGfgdcaa	Yeah I know what you mean, sometimes it feels easier to stay with what you know as opposed to moving on to something that you know will be better for you in the long run.<br>  <br>  Your ex never text back, which could indicate that she hasn't got a way of defending herself and maybe you were right, maybe she was cheating on you. If that's the case, you need to ask yourself would you be able to move on from that and get back together with her? The fact that you brought it up suggests no, and in that case, you did the right thing, you broke up with her and now you have that opportunity to move on and eventually go into a relationship that will be better for you.

There are always young couples who are trying to have a baby but for some reason the female can not . If they liked you and picked you out , then they could plant one of her eggs into your body and his sperm and then you would carry the baby for them ,but be careful  because at the delivery you may want to change your mind .

Or, consider becoming an animal communicator because you might actually have a gift -- don't rule becoming comedian also - Ha-ha <br>  <br>  This issue of seeing a naked camel is a serious one because someones pet camel seriously did try to have a relationship with them as per this site.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2007/08/pet-camel-kills-its-australian-owner.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2007/08/p...</a>|`|QPTlQCiSaa	If you are implying what I think you are, then maybe your man gets turned on by this...

KySLpGZGaa	honestly I've been in a similar situation where a guy I was really good Friends with started to have a major crush on me, when I nmade it clear to him that no I don't feel that way about him, he started to be really cruel and distant, now I don't even speak to him anymore. I'm going to be honest and say that truthfully it might not work out with him unless he's ready to accept that you don't feel that way about him. Give him space and if he's meant to be your friend and truly appreciates your friendship he should come back.|`|AA11657757	do carl a favor and stop being friends with him. everytime you see another guy, it will hurt him. if you let it continue, you're just using him to make you feel better. i had a friend who did this to a boy, and it made me sick to my stomach. do the right thing.
KySLpGZGaa	I have this best friend who has known me since the day I was born. Our families knew each other and she used to live next to my aunt (my mum used to work so I stayed there all the time) Our school was just up the road and we spent basically all day with each other. <br>  <br>  Now we're in different high schools for 6 years and hopefully we'll both get in to the same college. I've known her for 16 years and I don't know what I'd do without her. She knows me better than I know myself! *Hopefully I haven't jinxed it lol. Yeah she's more like my family and even though now we don't see ecah other all the time our friendships still going strong.|`|FATyhyZ2aa	I have female friend that we were confused for sisters or lesbians.  I was blessed to be at birth of 2 of 3 children and met her while pregnant w/ her 1st.  We've run a long road for over 20 years.  She even offered to be a surogate mother for me & spouse.  She's that selfless.  I can understand why you miss such closeness.  I can't imagine ever being w/o her.|`|WDEWAR8Faa	yes i have this friend her names priya and she more like my sister now and i dont rely know how we got so close but we only known each other 2 years and i feel like i've known her my whole life<br>  <br>  every relationship has ups and downs but even though we been through the toughest of times were style as close as we always been we know how to respect each other and we can always help each other through the worst situations.
6119de85724e004456dd63f7c51d0568aa	just talk to her. real friends dont get that mad at you for being dumb. like last week i was in a totaly bad mood and wouldnt do any of my work when my grades were already going down fast and my friend got mad at me but then we talked about it and we both felt better... uhh the trip thing might suck though if you guys arnt freinds anymore. so yeah just try to figure out whats actualy bugging her and let her know your there for her no matter how mad she gets at you cuz im sure it wasnt just you being dumb.|`|JBd3QeMNaa	She wasn't right to say that. i wasn't going to say give her time. i hate that. you should just get it over with. basically what I do is gradually during lessons joke with her, talk about something she really likes. when she gets talking just act oblivious to the fight. maybe it just slipped out, or shes angry with something you've done recently. ease back carefully into the friendship and if she ever approaches the subject dont go mental just talk it out without raising your voice.<br>  <br>  If this doesnt work find a new friend to make her jealous. (soz that sounds so bitchy!)|`|M1yfrNgDaa	dont be friends with him if hes not a good friend. dont be friends that disrespect you. find other people that would actually treat you like a good friend.|`|iAlK1v5caa	tell her if she don't like you for you then freak her!|`|lOR7CH0waa	Talk EVERYTHING out with her. EVERYTHING! Talk to her about how you feel about this situation and ask her how she feels. Ask her how you two can settle your differences and tell her how you feel about you two being friends off and on. Put every single detail out on the table and talk about it, and try not to start a fight!!!|`|IOWzXL9qaa	Well, when two people are mad at each other they may both say things they don't mean just to see who will end first. But yes "time" does heal a lot of things, but try to be the bigger person, I know it's hard, but an apology would be nice, and explain to her that you can always talk.|`|jFRoyt5Faa	thanks for answering my question.. well..<br>  <br>  my answer for your question..<br>  <br>  try to confront her..talk to her..<br>  ask her why she told you that you're being dumb..<br>  there's a lot of friends out there..<br>  but best-friend is just one..<br>  you can't find other best-friend..<br>  it's 1 in a million..<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|KZ1IbLQPaa	I have a "friend" EXACTLY LIKE THAT!!!! She acts very conseded and she thinks everything she says is right. Tell her to suck up her ego or you wont be her friend. If she is still mean then walk away and make sure your other friends understand so they know whats going on and can help you out.|`|VOyylTGtaa	Try thinking about what you could possibly have done to make her angry... if you think you know what might be the problem then change it. But otherwise get another friend to talk to her or something. I hope I helped|`|vugm5rxoaa	Ask her in a calm voice, what is really wrong. Because if you react calmly she will tell you. If she yells or ignores you, ask another day, until she tells you. -Don't Give Up|`|zmWotb1taa	Well,<br>  Just give it time!|`|Qbjpft5aaa	maybe she's not your 'best friend' then. i was going on and off with<br>  my 'best friend' for the past year or so. like. one day we'd be friends,<br>  the next we'd hate eachother, pretty much the same situation as you.<br>  we completely ended it recently, and believe it or not, it helped things.<br>  <br>  after we ended it, we didnt hate eachother like you'd think we would. <br>  the only change was that the tension between us was gone. do <br>  whtever you want in this situation, but maybe give her space. dont <br>  answer her texts or calls for a few days, that sorta thing. when YOUR <br>  ready, talk to her.<br>  <3 good luck.|`|rZGJJ26vaa	well she doesn't sound like the best friend - if she really is not talking to you for the reasons she said. try and ask her again what the problem is - and if it is because you are dumb - then that's not worth it - but try and smooth things over so you can stand each other again for your trips but i wouldn't trust her the same way again.|`|eqPFKpVqaa	Well tell her your not changing for anyone, you are who<br>  you are and if she doesn't like it then its her problem. And<br>  you deserve a better friend than that..so just find some new<br>  people to hang out with.

5ca74cb9e6d3604c2c41d86d59b901beaa	I don't think neither is right or wrong.He was being open and honest with his feeling and you just have to except that.As far as being friends,I think its a recipie for disaster and heart break because as his friend you have to stand there and see him eventually feel the way you feel about him for someone else and he has to understand that.|`|lFzFtiCBaa	sounds like he was the honest one by telling you his true feelings, and you may be the selfish one by not being negotiable with the situation.<br>  <br>  Did you ever think that maybe taking a break from your relationship and being just friends, may actually improve your relationship and possibly create a stronger bond between the 2 of you to help lead each other into a position feeling "In Love"?<br>  <br>  Sounds like he really isnt a jerk after all, maybe the way you responded was wrong.|`|rDb9ZLyfaa	If a  guy says "He loves you but is not in love with you"  he just means he is interested in someone else and doesn't want to hurt you any more than he already is.  You need to forget him and trust me when I say that he really doesn't want to be friends with you.  You should not be pathetic and pine over him anymore.  Move on and try to just let your heart heal by finding someone else who is truly into you.  Don't call him or text him or anything anymore.  Don't even talk about him!   In these situations you are better off letting him see that you have moved on and that will make him wonder if he made a mistake and what ever you do don't talk to him anymore. If he tries just say I am over you and have moved on maybe you should too|`|DbMCubDuaa	I think that you should tell him right now you just aren't ready and still need some time alone. As you recover from this you might decide that you want to be friends. But asking you that really isn't that bad. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|nBBeISEcaa	if it's better for you to completely not associate yourself with him then do it. It'll be better for you emotionally. But I do believe he needs to tell you why he's ending the relationship so abruptly. If he doesn't then try your best to get over him and move on.|`|6FIhIQ3Eaa	well his reason doesn't make sense so maybe he shud explain himself mor thoroughly. u probably hav a right to know his real reasons|`|KSfv6JnZaa	i have heard friends fall in love but being friends after lone...i think its painful..i dont find ur mistake here.ur response was truly natural|`|498JdszFaa	Dear Mandy, it's completely up to you to decide on this. He is acting selfish to demand this from you. He probably didn't expect you to react like that. Too bad for him.|`|1Lo34oEDaa	he still really likes you don't get mad at that. your probably lucky someone still likes you and you arent being shoved down the toilet by every guy. he does have the right to ask! why would he ask you if he wanted to stay friends. hes not selfish for asking you if he was selfish hed ask hmself.
xPfh6bW5aa	That guy sounds seriously confused, but it seems like he does still love you. Maybe you two do just need a break, give him a little more time to think about things, maybe some of those other problems he has are what's really bothering him. You sound like a pretty nice girl, so I don't think he doesn't want to be with you, he just needs a break. Wait for a little longer, like another month or so and see where things go.<br>  "Let him go and if its meant to be, fate will bring you back together."|`|0SREhTB2aa	Woah. Hunni you are having a tough time.<br>  He seems so mixed up.<br>  All you could do is now is stop texting him and let come to you.<br>  Let him figure things out let him come back to you.<br>  I think that is the only way this could be resolved.<br>  If you still love, dont be cold back. Hes proberly being like this because he has somethin in mind so he uses an excuse like hes busy.<br>  If you really to speak to someone about it just incase something new happens then id be happy to help.<br>  nina_sattar@yahoo.co.uk<br>  Hopefully, everything would be ok.<br>  Just give it time sweety x|`|Kw4zqfu0aa	He treats you like this because it is over. Yes, he wanted to be the "good guy" and was really nice the first times he saw you after the breakup, but now he thinks he does not need to be, he already did his 'obligation'. Sorry, but his is life. He is just not that into you.<br>  <br>  There is not such a thing as "he wishes he was 25 so he could marry me right now". First, he did not have to marry you, you were dating... nothing wrong with that and second, there is no law saying 22 cannot get married (I don't recommend it, but it is not unheard of). <br>  <br>  Ok, here is my point: please see the situation like it is. Don't try to come up with excuses for how he treated you. It is over, but it is not the end of the world: you are so young, you will meet new people. Believe me.|`|S0n3DinFaa	I would just keep an open friendship with him.  Let him know that you still want to be his friend.  But you have to go on with your life!  Go do things with friends and stop dwelling on this guy!  Yes, be friendly, but that is it.  Make sure he knows that you will always be there for him.  Then in the future if it develops into something again it was meant to be, if not... no time lost..<br>  <br>  Move on with your life.  Life is to short to dwell on the past!  Live and learn!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|VwPchPHtaa	he wasn't being cold , he was busy at the time, just not with you,  and that wasn't mean either . now im not going to tell you what you want to hear, i will tell you whats happening, im 48 yrs old, and went to college for 10 yrs, so i do know a lil something. Your relationship is over!!, he's moving on , your not , your in your 4th year, which is great, pick your butt up , hang on to only the fun times , and step on, you have a future to consider and maybe student loans to pay off, a career to enter, marriage, a house, a car, and all the bills to go with it , and your not going to get it done worrying about this man who broke up with you! remember that part , he broke up with you.|`|l5ZlateWaa	i had this problem with my partner we are married now when this was going on he wasnt ready to settle down and was stressed out with uni i can obviously see he is deeply in love with you if you are willing to wait for him it will be worth it in the end but u need to tell him u love him and u r willing to wait he may be worried incase you lose interest and get a new man i hope it works out for you love x good luck x|`|oQkwZhXpaa	Maybe you should date a few people, nothing really serious, just go out with them once or twice or something, and make your ex see what he is missing out on. You say he would be hurt if you were with someone else it would hurt him, so maybe you should hurt him a bit as he has obviously hurt you, and it would show you one way or the other, how much he likes you. I truly think he loves you, he just isnt sure exactly what he wants, and by doing the above, it will make him really think, you know, if i go away then i won't see her again, ever" and it will give you an opportunity to think about whether that was really what you wanted, and branch out and meet some new people, because, weird as it sounds, you might meet someone even better.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should also say to your ex, if he tries to hug you or whatever (this will be really hard, but necessary) something like "you made a decision to leave me, which hurt me, you can't just act like we are together again when you see me, its going to make it harder for both of us to get over each other if thats what you really wanted" because its not fair for him to make you feel like there is still a chance if he really has made up his mind.<br>  <br>  Give him another chance, he may be insecure and think you are going to leave him if he doesnt leave you first. Make it clear you will always be there for him.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :) Good Luck you'll be OK :)|`|t74mM7Wvaa	He is an idiot, but to be fair, he is afraid of commitment.  You might do better for yourself, finding a new boyfriend, if nothing else it will get a reaction rather good or bad from this odd ball you are in love with.|`|ElmBGq2Saa	That might be his way of expressing either one of two things: <br>  <br>  1. He's trying to get over you. And can't really talk with you, communicate with you, or share the same feelings as you. He wants distance and is trying to distance himself from you, by not giving you anything.<br>  <br>  2. He's still in love with you, and this is his way of trying to get your attention. Clearly, giving you space and being a nice guy hasn't helped much. Maybe now; by acting different, you'll give him your affection and attention. By acting different your drawn to him on a different level, than if he'd answered "Ok thanks darling" or something like that.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure if either of these choices are right. However, what I'd do was ask him what's up. Just be concise, clear and upfront about him. Text him or call him and ask him if he needs help and/or you can do anything for him. Don't be afraid to contact him; what's the worst thing that could happen? If you've been seeing each other for two years, there's little he doesn't know about your personality/behavior.<br>  <br>  Hope I could help, and good luck with your relationship.|`|zXnqoVjUaa	I feel really bad for you, I can imagine you must be totally mixed up right now. You said he mentioned feeling old, and he needed space, I think that probably he is feeling pretty mixed up himself, and is more than likely a bit unsure what he wants which is probably why he was so affectionate toward you after the break up. I would guess the reason for him being cold toward you now is probably that by remaining close to you through the start of the break up, it was probably harder for him to come to terms with his choice by still seeing you, speaking to you and hugging you, he is maybe trying a different approach to help him get over it, without realizing he is hurting you in the process, I think you should maybe explain to him that his actions are confusing you and try and talk to him about why he is behaving like that now, maybe between you both you can talk and work out a way to move on that works for both of you. Right now I would say he isn't being fair by treating you one way and then another, anyone would be confused by that. I think you should voice your feelings to him and see what's going on in his head if he will open up to you about it. If not you should probably keep a distance, and protect your heart. xxx|`|QP8LdPLeaa	look just leave him alone. the guy obviously doesn't know what he wants. but as far as being mean, i believe hes only mean when he's asking or making you wait until hes older, asking you to put your life on hold and wait for him. i think what he's doing is beyond stupid. why is 25 the magic number to be with someone? i really don't get it. those are a few years hes wasting without you.<br>  <br>  it sounds like hes trying to have it both ways, always kissing you, hugging you for a long time but yet you guys are not boyfriend and girlfriend. i really do believe there is a VERY strong connection between you guys, but i think this whole thing is too unfair towards you.<br>  <br>  no matter how much i love a guy, i WILL NOT wait on him to turn 25 or whatever silly magic age he's waiting for, i will continue my life and date another guy who is worth my time, its all about common courtesy and respect.. nobody has control over their age. i believe he needs to live life in a steady pace and stop trying to rush it.|`|f8ON3dRfaa	I don't know if you believe I understand your predicament, but I really do.<br>  <br>  Personally, I believe he does have issues he needs to settle. Growing up issues, he's maturing, he's no longer a kid. He needs to figure out what his goals in life are, what his future will be, if he wants to get married by 24/25, he needs to secure a job and save up, plus, perhaps family issues? Your boy, is becoming a man.<br>  <br>  You handled it well, gave him the space he needed. I know, you know, he loves you, but he wants you to fit nicely into his life, at the right time, at the right moment. This means that he cares. He can choose to drag you down with all the other burdens in his life by not breaking up with you, yet can't support you emotionally. Girls need emotional security and he feels that with so much going on and changing in his life, he has no strength to maintain the demands of a relationship. Like it or not, relationship can be demanding. But I don't doubt his love for you.<br>  <br>  He's cold because he's stuck and confused. I tell you what he would appreciate down the road. He will appreciate your thoughtfulness in giving him the space he needed to sort out his life, his goals and his purposes. Once he has it all settled, all that you've done and sacrificed for him will come to him 10x harder as he revel in the knowledge that you've been supportive.<br>  <br>  If you love him, the last thing you need to do is to bombard him with questions. I'm sure there are already a million questions in his mind. Show him your support by being available as and when he needs you. And give him space as and when he needs it, without much of a grumble.Yes, you're sacrificing for him. But that's love isn't it? <br>  <br>  I'm very sure he loves you, thus want to set himself right, before coming to you in a committed relationship, so he can better provide for your needs.|`|DNyQYKLHaa	Well first of all, I doubt many people are going to read that haha no offence. I'm not sure for the reason of the break up tbh but I assume it's because he wanted to concerntrate on his studies and maybe didn't want to be in a relationship. He might have hit 22 and realised he hadn't achieved much in life and didn't want to settle down, so that's why he wishes he met you at 25 when he had done all the stuuff he wanted to do.<br>  <br>  Another point is, I'm not sure what your asking and what you want. Do you want him back? Give him time and move on, maybe in a few years of months you'll see each other and both be single and start up ur relationship again. I think if you just want to get over him, just stop texting him. Obviously if he texts/calls you, don't ignor him! i think after his first "ok" text reply you should have just left it there. Not keep bringing up his decision, I doubt its a opic anyone would want to talk about. The 'Im Busy' text was because he was annoyed and probably also busy.<br>  <br>  And when you do occasionally meet up with him, it doesn't mean ur going to get back together. Friends do hug and kiss too, obviously he still has feelings for you but like you said; he needs time to sort things out. You need to just forget him and let him make a decision in the future, he broke up with you for a reason, but it doesn't mean he doesnt still love you or cares for you.<br>  <br>  So my advice is just let him be, dont annoy him with random texts. If you meet up and stuff, great, but dont force it. Just let him chill until he wants to meet up again. Simple thoughtful texts on his birthdays or w/e like happy birthday, have a good one xx. That will be enough to keep in touch and show him u still care without being all clingy.<br>  <br>  Btw I'm not over 21, sorry, hoped i Helped.|`|PpYl2dFVaa	personally i see it like he loves you he just wants to spare any heart ache that could come out of rushing into something<br>  wants to make sure that you guys are right he is young and doesnt want to feel like he missed out on his youth<br>  i think its a good decision then when he is ready and the time is right he will appreciate your patience while he took time to find himself|`|WK8MZlLdaa	he is most likely to be thinkng about his future. both of u are at uni. He will be graduating this yr. He suddenly needs to think about this future, jobs etc. <br>  <br>  He must had been immature not to have thought about all these thigns before. Rather naive being in university not thinking about these things and suddenly life requires u to move on and u realise what u need and what u dont need. It sounds like he never considered his life, his future properly, and defintitely not with u in it. Its just part of growing up. most ppl are like this, they dont think too much, go into a relationship blind. even if it lasts, when life changes, the relationship breaks. <br>  <br>  It doesnt sound like you fit into him future plans. You understand? He likes u when he sees you because he misses those moments. they were true genuine feelings you had for each other and anyone would miss that. but that does NOT mean he loves you now the way he DID understand? Dont be disllusioned by that because it is not. <br>  <br>  best that you move on. im sorry but this is just my advice. u know the situation best so take these yahoo answers as interesting view points but untimately u should rely on these.|`|i9nlUZb0aa	Why don't you try moving on. Stop worry about him and think about yourself. You sound like your so desperate or something. I know that you've been with him for two years, and you say that things were great. But it sounds like he needs space, so let him have it. But that doesn't mean you have to stop living and enjoying your young years. Go out have fun, be around your friends, let them help you through this. Then if mister right comes back and you still have the same feelings for him then try again, but don't be so eager to go back to someone who cant even be honest with you and tell you the real reason for the break-up. I believe that you should have at least dissevered that much from someone you have been dating for two years.Good-luck

If you find someone that seems interesting and you to meet and get along, then it is fine. I met a man on Myspace and he has turned out to be one of the best friends I have. Didn't work out in the romantic aspect, but friends are even more important. Go for it!|`|R9tUWsXnaa	Of course not, you think people will look at you wrong, HELLO.<br>  <br>  Ha, what about EHarmony, or others.<br>  <br>  Your fine, however it works for you is well....however it works for you<br>  ;)
A6glEhWwaa	Sibling.<br>  Boyfriends come and go-<br>  Familys there forever.|`|cp2182xNaa	Boyfriend. I've been with him for over 2 years and I'm so much closer with him than I am with any of my siblings. I have 3 half siblings who only lived with us half the time and are all out of the house now. My sisters were always really quiet and I have no idea what's going on in their lives besides where they're living, working, and who their boyfriends are. Same with my brother really. They all come by a lot, and it's nice to have them around, but I never had that sibling relationship with any of them. I like them all, and yes I love them as family, but it's really not the same. I wish I could have the relationship with them that my friends have with their siblings, but it's never going to happen. I love my boyfriend more than pretty much anyone in this world and could see myself spending the rest of my life with him. It sounds terrible, but I'd choose him.<br>  <br>  Edit: I'm closer with my brother's 5 year old daughter, my niece, than I am with my sisters.|`|qeNrGoMsaa	They say blood is thicker than water... If it came down to a choice I think you would engage in a mental battle. It would depend on how long you have been in love versus the lifetime love of a sibling and whether you were close to your sibling.<br>  This is a deep question with many answers no right no wrong....can you really answer it with a clean heart. hmmmmm|`|a1f98EP5aa	That is a tough question, that i am sure not many people has ever wanted to think about, i mean me and my sisters are not to close and i love my wife fully and i really dont know what i would do, granted my wife is so much closer to me then my sisters but they are still my blood, and even thinking about it now i cant answer what i would do i think it would all depend on the situation that was happening...but i do know i cant stand the thought of losing any of my sisters or my wife.|`|VesvS20kaa	Wow! That is one question I can not answer. Never thought of it like that an now I'm thinking 'Which would I save if hanging off a cliff'. Thanks, my day is now wrecked. Haha
M961DkIjaa	I think this is a great idea.  I have always said that if I ever did get married or live with a boyfriend again, I want my own bedroom.  I don't think it says anything about your commitment or love for the other person.  It only says that you value your space and it's really better for the both of you if you get to have some space between you, no matter how untraditional it seems. This is a great idea.|`|AA12316366	as far as i am  concerned the moe bathrooms the better it is. personally i can't stand the smell of all the perfumes, hair spray and all the other things that women use.|`|mDMnhqwdaa	Yeah, that's a great idea and very organized.|`|T024qfKZaa	Oh, my yes! A bathroom apiece will definitely make the relationship easier.<br>  <br>  Private time is very important.|`|uwCcIY8Aaa	yes. that's absolutely perfect.|`|Q2UDhYgkaa	Yes - I need a whole bathroom to keep all my hair products, skincare, nail polish etc.|`|2c2W4zQJaa	It also works if you and your spouse have different times in which you have to be at work.|`|wxYahzV7aa	wait your a couple ??? but your not sharing a room
NBDLUOkiaa	Not unless her devotion to you in all of these years hasn't worked for you.|`|AA11447210	As long as she's been faithful to you, her past sexual behavior is totally irrelevant. All you needed to know when you two got together is that she's disease free.<br>  <br>  If she lied, the lying is an issue but chances are that occured because she figured you'd negatively judge her. It's understandable why she did it, when she just should've told you her number was none of your business. Doesn't excuse the lying, but explains it.<br>  <br>  If you want to drop a 25 yr relationship over behavior that occured before you two were together, that's your call...but seems pretty stupid unless the relationship has already fallen apart for other reasons.|`|Ag8pE3Cyaa	...and your point is?<br>  <br>  ADD: once again....it's ok for a single man to have several sex partners but if it's a woman we see it as being a flaw in her character. So she had several partners, so what! You've been enjoying an inhibited wife for the last 25 years. You would have preferred to marry a virgin and then spend 25 years begging for sex because she thinks it's dirty.|`|09k5GLLkaa	You must be out of your mind to even ask. Let it go man. It is called the "past" for a reason. It was her life not yours. It doesn't matter now. You can either let it get you down, or you can let it go and get on with your life. Do you want to be miserable?|`|AA12159712	Don't be stupid. That was long ago and before you were married. And now you find out, you want to hold something against her for something as old as that?  If she's been faithful for the 25 years with you, that says a lot for her, doesn't it?|`|quMUHyPsaa	That was before you were married.  You should probably let it go.  It's not fair to treat her badly for things that happened in the past.  Focus on the person she is now and stop being such a meanie.|`|C6IFaaEaaa	Are you willing to put your 25 year old marriage on the line for this. What is really bothering you.  The fact that she was what you call promiscuous or that it took you 25 years to find out.
Se7Y94S7aa	what dick would stop liking a chick because of scars, if you love her why would you break if off over scars seriously, if my gf had scars i wouldn't care along as i love her and she loves me, u have nothing to worry about|`|FBzdlncBaa	Would not matter at all. :)<br>  <br>  If a guy was so shallow to be turned off by your scars, he is NOT worth the time of day.<br>  <br>  I have a lot of pretty chronic stretch marks on the tops of my thighs when I did bodybuilding last year and gained stacks of muscle. A year later, I've lost all of it and I'm left with these really bad stretch marks.<br>  <br>  If you can get your hands on this product called "Bio Oil": <a href="http://www.bio-oil.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bio-oil.com</a>  (I live in Australia and I can get it... If you can't get it in the country you live, try ebay or search the net to see if you can get it sent to you)<br>  <br>  It REALLY reduces the appearance of scars and stretch marks.<br>  <br>  My stretch marks have 95% faded. I'm anticipating they will all go.<br>  <br>  My brother used it for his appendix operation scar. You can't even tell he had it thanks to bio oil.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. :)|`|AMrkXKV3aa	i'm a girl, but if the guy likes you it shouldn't matter if you have a couple scars here and there he'll get over it and if he makes a fuss about it i'd assume he's a jerk and not worth it.|`|oUSR0Kmiaa	personally i wouldn't care.  if i like someone, i like that person, scars or not.  also its from surgeries.  its not like you cut yourself or something that would indicate an emotional problem.  i say don't worry about it.  i know that it's easier said then done.  hope this helps.|`|0oF6yFmPaa	No, that wouldn't matter to me.. Really, if I like a girl, that stuff doesn't bother me. If you didn't tell me and I saw them, I'd be surprised though..|`|XYvBdLlXaa	they shouldn't care at all,<br>  especially because it's from heart surgeries.<br>  you may want to tell them before hand though :)|`|5Emj6YMAaa	no thats ******* hot
WI1Mz9YTaa	he worked hard to win you over and now that he has you, he is putting less effort. or maybe there is something bothering him. you should talk to him and see if you can help, cause obviously he loves you a lot, there must be something on his mind. if you approach him, he'll even appreciate you more since you'd seem like you care.<br>  communication in key in each relationship. don't keep wondering, just ask him!!<br>  Analyzing too much and jumping to wrong conclusions only make things worst|`|p6hIgKWTaa	he needs some space|`|Xg2WmhPSaa	Some guys dont really like talking on the phone.  Maybe he'd rather talk to you in person.  Or he could be seeing someone else when he tells you he went to sleep early.  It's hard to say when I dont know the complete situation.|`|Rp0XXwicaa	he loves u and he thinks that if you he goes out twith u helll embarrass you and he doesnt wana do anything to mess things up talk to him about it he loves u|`|26414b2f3237391dde0fd3b0221fcffcaa	It feels almost like you're describing me here! I'm not going to say he's just like me, but he sounds similar from what you've described. I'm a guy who'll be sociable for short periods of time, but who doesn't have the energy to keep being around other people for prolonged periods of time. I'm someone who also doesn't like too much small talk, and I have a hard time talking about things that aren't deep or meaningful to me. I can be the life of a party, too, but I quickly lose interest in social gatherings. I often feel that I have little in common with most people. Most people bore me. Perhaps your boyfriend feels the same way?<br>  <br>  As I mentioned, your boyfriend could be different. I don't want to make too many assumptions here. You should ask him how he feels about socialising.|`|zRI33zu2aa	Maybe he's just going through a "relaxed" phase where he is just enjoying simplicity and quiet and staying home.  Maybe he's got some stuff on his mind and he doesn't feel like talking or going out.  I personally deal with stress the same way you are describing the way he's acting.  Maybe he just doesn't like talking on the phone.  I know a few people who are like that.  They would prefer to keep phone conversations short.  Or maybe he is busy with his kids.  I'm not sure how old they are but beleive me it can be really hard to focus on anything else when they are little and depend on you for everything.  I'm sure you are not "out of sight, out of mind."  He probably thinks about you often and he obviously cares about you if he's said those things and introduced you to his family.|`|5fIBXX7gaa	do you go to his house with him? if  yes then that's fine then you know you can trust him but if he is being secretive then he needs to open up just a little more|`|IRikuHx4aa	There's a lot of options to this. Well, he could be lying and say he loves you when he doesn't, he could be cheating or something (Don't take it the wrong way, mostly when guys do that, that's what they're doing, but some are different.) or he could be shy, sometimes. Maybe he's looking for time for himself for a little bit. Well, six months, I'm sure he loves you unless he ends up dumping you or something. Just ask him what's going on, and why he does that. Don't be harsh about it, just say you've been wondering because you're confused. I'm sure things will straighten up soon! Good luck. :D
pQGb9dy8aa	This is a tough situation. You'll just have to remind B again who her REAL friends are (you, or A). She should come around. Besides, how could this possibly be your fault?

i9nlUZb0aa	First off she should never have went out with you in the first place if she really wanted to know you as a friend first. So that should tell you right there that she is no longer interested in you and wants to move on but figured she didn't want to crush you by saying it is over so she left you hanging with a maybe in the future we may try again after we get to know each other. The best thing for you to try and do is move on. Let her know that if she doesn't want you, then theirs other fish in the sea who do. Don't let anyone play mind games with you. There's always someone else who would treat you right if you give them a chance. Good-luck, and keep that head up high.|`|6nMLLh2Naa	man, this is the same thing im going through with my ex now;<br>  this what you do just let it go, through away all the **** she gave you nd just start healing for a while start flirting with other girls/guys, go to the barber place/hair salon get your feet done or whatever, go shopping hang with the guys/girls that's how you will get over her. and go to a club and find a girl/guy(it's all about the chase). i|`|PpYl2dFVaa	sometimes you dont get over it!<br>  :( i know how u feel|`|nk3QCoPvaa	Well sir, you have options. First off, look at yourself long and hard in the mirror. You're what - twenty? You thinkin about settling down and starting a family are ya? Second of all, you are in college. Hit the books chum. Read ten of them and then (and only then) come up for air. Read Siddhartha by Hesse. Read Atlas Shrugged by Rand. Read some Hemingway. (Read a lot of Hemingway.) Read The Great Gatsby by Fitzgerald. Read All Quiet on the Western Front by Remarque. Read all these, and the ones you discover along that path that intrigue you. Open your mind. Expand your awareness of the world. Learn, learn, learn. College doesn't last forever, and it will change you if you work hard at it. Marriage is forever, and the responsibilities of raising children is made oh so much more pleasant if you can entertain yourself with the enlightened thoughts inside your own mind. Date a lot of women. Sew your wild oats. While you're twenty, be twenty. Eat it whole. There is plenty of time to be thirty when you're thirty...|`|0SREhTB2aa	I mean it sounds as if shes proberly asking for an excuse to break up since she wouldnt mind you seeing other girls.<br>  If she really wanted to get to know you as a friend, then she would start making the effort and talk to you and of course, she still would mind you being with other girls but since she said she doesnt, it sounds like she used an excuse to break up with you.<br>  If she talks to you then talk back, if she doesnt, you dont have to. You didnt do anything bad an sooner or later she will realise that she misses your company. <br>  Good luck sweety x|`|IRikuHx4aa	Try to avoid her a little bit, but not much. You can smile at her, and ask her what's been going on or something. But also let her know that you can move on a little. Eventually she may see that you're not after her as much, and she might want it back badly. She may come running back to you. If she gives you a final answer of saying she doesn't want to be with you, then try your best to move on. There's tons of girls out there that would probably die for a guy like you. Trust me.|`|FgSTHArKaa	aaack its so hard eh<br>  this is similar to my question. but the breakup was because he turned 22 and had alot of stress in his life first.<br>  Ok here is the thing, you have to smile and wave wehenever you see her but dont initiate a conversation or anything.<br>  She willwonder why you arent all over her alreayd and will DEFINITELY miss it, trust me.

I think that the key to any good relationship is friendship and Communication . So get to know the best way that you can, and let her get to know  you. If  she still just wants to be friends with you then maybe it just wasn't met to be, and by her saying that she is not going to stop you from seeing other girls ; should tell you that maybe the real reason she broke up with you is because she wants to date other people. I know it is hard to believe it but you have to consider it. Maybe the best thing for you to do is to just take a break from her and dating for a while. best of luck hun!|`|qOVMZWMpaa	You should definitely try and be friends. As a girl, I know there is nothing worse than splitting up with your boyfriend and then they ignore you and avoid you like you don't exist. <br>  She obviously still likes you but doesn't think she knows you well enough to go back out with you. Have fun around her and show her that you aren't boring- because girls love fun guys! and also be yourself around her, I know it is hard but don't put on an act or don;t try and be cool.<br>  Also, wait a while and start texting her. Don't swamp her in messages as you will seem very clingy. But girls don't like to make the first moves, so if she is thinking about getting back with you- There is no other way to find out that texting her and starting a conversation.<br>  Hope it helped xx|`|sc9bU85Laa	This is my opinion. I find it hard to down shift so quickly how can one day you go to being more then friends to the next being just friends especially if you are the one being broken up with. The way have done in the past I tell them I can't don't shift that quickly it is not that I don't ever want to be friends but I just can't give the friendship so soon or not at all because it still may hurt and only time will tell.  Most of the time I don't stay friends with my ex it is too complicated and too weird but some  people can.|`|E23PtUEtaa	Let her go man..How does she go from wanting to be with you to wanting to be your "friend"? Have you changed? Is she not attracted to you anymore all of a sudden? Please... My girl told me that too and I wasnt having it... Shes just going to lead you on by saying that you can pick it up later.. and she doesnt care about you seeing other girls? why not? Is that because she is seeing other guys? Let it go, save your heart from the extra heart break. Find a girl that knows what she wants and appreciates you. Her saying all that to you is a red flag for immaturity.

Have you gained a lot of weight? Do you think that you have checked out everything to see if he is having an affair? Maybe he has a clue in his wallet like a new phone number? Ask him what is wrong and tell him why you feel this way. He needs to know that you sense something is different in his behavior. He could have a girlfriend too.|`|3e1b3e079efb337d73fb2101683fcab3aa	If his back hurts then offer to rub it, sometimes it takes that physical connection to get a guy's attention and that often times can lead to other things...|`|AA12185240	He may be worried my husband does this when he has a lot on his mind|`|498JdszFaa	Maybe he has trouble getting an erection and is embarrassed to talk about it?

IXdz6mmLaa	i suggest the only reason you would break up with your boyfriend is if you fall out of love with him..thats all..not for any other guy because that would just be a big mess..your probably used to being with your boyfriend right now and getting with a new person right away would be quite different and you wont like it...your boyfriend treats you a certain way..and this "crush" of yours will treat you in another way..thats why i would be different..and you may not like it.....well if its just a crush..dont worry about it..it should go away in time..talk to your boyfriend about it..if he's understandable..because i know guys that would flip if you tell them that! or what you can do if ur bf is like that is simply not talk to ur crush that often..or even see him..that should help dramatically..also that might be a sign that ur relationship is getting dull..try doing exciting things with your bf like go out places where you never been b4..stuff like that...|`|lSeb6xHXaa	this happens all the time in long relationships. i think its normal, as long as its only a crush and that you ont act on it. <br>  if you feel a little more then that for this other guy maybe its because you are getting slightly bored with the mundanes of your relationshipp with your boyfriend|`|pjggSVKKaa	maby cos ur a bit bored of the ususal routine and you need some excitement your not cheating your just human and you need some excitement its happened to me ull just realise how great your boyfriend is and forget about everyone else and get married hehe hopefully|`|0SREhTB2aa	It happens in some relationships.<br>  The question here is do you still love your boyfriend the same way you did? <br>  If yes then I think you shouldnt be worried about that crush.

I asked a good friend, who was a friend of my brother also, he was great and we all had a good time. (good times, free food, drink), just ask for a polite escort.  You will be ok.  Even a cousin who won't blow his cover would most likely to come also.

If this lass was sooo fantastic he would still be with her and not with you!  Got to agree with other comments though, leopards rarely change their spots unless with the perfect game-keeper and if he's willing to unload on you without thinking of your feelings you might have to face facts that it probably isn't you.|`|TG3f9ov1aa	He prob feels guilty to be honest... he prob did care for her maybe not in love but CARED so the fact that his actions hurt her so much he prob feels guilty about it...<br>  <br>  It doesnt mean he doesnt like you  he prob has issues about the whole thing <br>  <br>  It coul get tricky for you though if he hasnt worked throughthese issues|`|DozD8lTGaa	No, i think he just misses her. Which, is fair enough; it was his wife and i imagine they were together for quite some time??<br>  <br>  I would be offended about the sex part though! Talk to him now he is sober and tell him what he said... At least then he can come out with it and explain what he meant by it.<br>  <br>  Don't be mad at him though because, he isn't just going to get over her like that. He clearly has feelings for you or he wouldn't be with you..?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  So, keep that in mind :)<br>  Good luck in getting it sorted and i hope i helped :) X|`|XT81GCu1aa	The thing that jumps out at me here is that both these incidents obviously bother you a lot, as they probably should.  Combined with the fact that when sober, you said your b/f does not open up much and communicate.  It seems like that is the bigger issue than the drunken "admission" about the ex, b.c isn't the best case scenario that what he said was untrue, but at the end of the day you still have a b/f who doesn't open up and communicate with you that much.  Try not to let the "admission" bother you too much, as other posters said if he wanted to be with her he would be.  I know that's hard!  <br>  <br>  Try to move on and talk to him about communicating more, and let him know that you might need to talk with him about his past infidelities before moving forward with him.  Let him know that you love him very much and hope he can share more freely with you.  Good luck.
4Hv0i2Y8aa	I feel for you, and hope you get the help you need. However, this is the WEDDING forum. You might get better answers if you post this question in the Health forum.|`|ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	I seriously agree with rtc.  That was not pot.  Pot doesn't have that effect on people.  More serious drugs like cocaine and LSD do.  <br>  <br>  You need to seek some medical attention.<br>  <br>  You said all your friends smoked that same stuff, but it may have not been the last patch that was laced.  It may have been any of the batches in the last several months.  It might have been a little in several batches that's only a problem b/c you smoked all of them.<br>  <br>  You do need to stop anyway though.  It's not recreational if you become addicted and why would you attempt to become addicted to something?  I mean it's expensive, it stops you from getting many jobs since you can't pass a drug test, and you don't even enjoy it.  What is your motivation here?  Everyone can look at you and tell you are a druggie.  Plus we didn't even mention that smoking isn't good for your health.<br>  <br>  But about the paranoia, yes like Rtc said, seek medical attention.  Something has happened and you may need medicine for the rest of your life.|`|OHnndI0xaa	Sounds like you smoked some stuff that had a little something extra in it.  You need to stop IMMEDIATELY and get medical attention.  The same thing happened to a guy I knew when we were teenagers, his pot was laced with LSD and he'll never be the same.  He takes medication daily after being diagnosed with schizophrenia due to the LSD.  <br>  Learn a lesson from this, and I hope your friends do too.  It sounds like you are all pretty young.
FxIZUUY5aa	ok, well im a girl, but id say get out and meet some girls. or do you have any friends who go to coed schools? try to plan something with them and have them invite some girls and then hang out with them|`|PYZ3APQDaa	when you find a girl you really care for or that really cares for her. just tell her that you don't know how she likes to be kissed and could she show you. it is so fun to let the other person guide you and before you know it you will be teaching her how to kiss!|`|BymaXUvXaa	well dude,<br>  <br>  ask "experienced" people...<br>  <br>  haha... <br>  experienced in the sense that many girls like them because of the way they act and look....<br>  ask for help,,,,<br>  that's the simplest and easiest way.....
3ccD7M04aa	My husband uses the "Mimi" from Passion Parties (under the just for him) section and he thinks it's the best product for guys out there.  He uses it when I'm not in the mood.  I don't think you have to worry about being distracted from your sex life if you're sexually satisfied ;)|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	I think there ok. Anything that can add spice to the bedroom is fine by me. Just no strapons, lol.|`|AA11447210	Adult toys are fine...they add variety, different experiences, and can help a couple's sex life keep from getting to be too routine. Some people like them, some don't.<br>  <br>  I think toys with a partner are fun sometimes...keeping things mixed up is a good way to keep a healthy sex life going. ???|`|xDdhUldraa	Adult toys are ok. They tend to change the same-ol'-same to something different.  They should not be the final do-all, as the act itself is between the couple and the main reason for even doing it, but from time to time, you just have to let go.|`|wIkGLOgnaa	there fantastic! the wife and I use them all the time, try an inexpensive one first the noise may distract you at first but the feeling will more then make up for it!!!!!|`|Tl3lF37Xaa	It is cool thing!!! Try this sex shop online <a href="http://pleasuretoys.biz/" rel="nofollow">http://pleasuretoys.biz/</a> !|`|IhvRyyxtaa	Toys are fun but they only play a part of an encounter. They do help in finding out what the other person likes or dislikes.
uqMK3rUZaa	If she hasn't gone to the hospital please encourage her to go to the hospital NOW. There's a five-day window in which evidence can be collected, plus she can get the morning-after pill and STD testing.<br>  <br>  If you mean it, tell her you'll be there to listen. Don't ask a lot of questions. Just let her talk. Be patient. In training to become a crisis call taker, I learned several very important things about being a good listener.<br>  <br>  Acceptance (be nonjudgmental even if you don't agree)<br>  Genuine (be caring, compassionate, and real)<br>  Empathy (be there with the person in the person's feelings)<br>  <br>  Reflect the content of what she's saying. Reflect the feelings. example of reflecting content: "You went somewhere you regret going." example of reflecting the feelings. "It sounds like you feel scared." When you want to ask a question, word it as an open-ended statement. examples: "I'm wondering what options you've considered." "I wonder who you feel you can turn to for support." "Tell me more about..." When it sounds like she's come to some decisions, help her look into her options. It helps if you've already done research into what resources she can turn to for help.<br>  <br>  It's okay to feel uncomfortable, but if you can be someone she can turn to and count on that could make a world of difference. :o)|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	I wouldn't bring it up to her. let her bring it up. All you can do is let her know when she needs to talk your are there for anything she needs.|`|T1R6UZDOaa	Just let her know that you will be there for her and also ask if she needs you to go to the doctor with her.  Because after a rape they victim should go to the doctor and make sure everything is still alright.  Just be there with her and for her, but don't force her to talk to you about it because her emotions are very raw at this point.|`|FATyhyZ2aa	You can tell her that you sorry she is going through this & would like to be there for her at any time day or night. Assure her that 2:AM calls or texts are okay b/c even though you can't begin to understand how she is feeling right now you do know that she might need to talk at any time this bothers her.  Then ask, "Do want to talk about this now?"  "How are you feeling about it?"  I can hold you if you just want to cry.  I can stay with you even if you want to be alone in your room.  Find call the Nat'l rape help line for a free counselor in your area.  (They're all free from shelters out reach offices).  Tell her that you'll ride her there & stay w/ her.<br>  <br>  These are just some of the options.|`|pQGb9dy8aa	Just remind her that you'll always be there for her if she needs someone to talk to, ir a shoulder to cry on. That's what best friends are for. You don't want to just dive in and start talking to her about it, because obviously it will be a touchy subject. So just give her time, and if she wants to talk, she'll talk.<br>  Best of luck. (:|`|gQudMMTXaa	if you cant think of what to say dont say anything, just be there instead it might help more! just watch movies eat junk food and then when or if she ready to talk she will know that you are there!|`|e35afd8faf0256de4cc5b8d84a6c8a78aa	Let her know that you are there for her. And even though it did not happen to you, that you are angry and hurt that someone would do this to her. And maybe you could go to some counseling with her to help you and her to cope with how you feel.|`|1KSVwuoUaa	talk about what she wants to talk about that way you don't 'touch on a sensitive ground'. BTW: This is a really good question!
ySsKWH4kaa	Okay. First I want to just say, that asking a guy out who has a girlfriend is NOT a good i dea. lol. Trust me =\ its not lol. <br>  <br>  I dont know enough about the guys and you to know who you should go out with. And only you know who you REALLY like. So get a close friend who knows the situatuion to ask you a series of question as quickly as possible without thinking. Example:<br>  <br>  Chicken or Pizza?<br>  Pencils or Pen?<br>  Pick or Purple?<br>  Cat or dog? <br>  Cameron or Brendon?<br>  <br>  If you're going quick enough and answering right away, you wont think to much and your heart will just tell you to say who you truly love. Good luck! <333<br>  <br>  By the way, if you pick Cameron, Please wait till he's out of the relationship with the other girl because if she finds out you broke them up she will have a hissy fit! lol happened to me ;\ lol.<br>  <br>  Good luck! <333|`|a1iam8Zvaa	Brendon<br>  doesnt cameron have a gf? <br>  hes obviously not into you if he does<br>  give brendon a chance u could always break it off if u don like it|`|AbAHhcwiaa	maybe you should just wait for Cameron or just go out with Brendan and maybe make him jealous, its worth a try ;)|`|7ZsD0Irtaa	If the girl Cameron asked out said yes you should go out with Brendan Have a little fun.And besides guys want what other guys want so if u go out with Brendan Cameron would start to maybe reconsider you. So you'll probally be able to go out with Cameron in the near future after Brendan. so dont worry it would be cute and besides the more the marrier (more boys more fun)  :]|`|GTKXq7A1aa	If bredan is a good person go for him.<br>  Its not like you guys will get married....|`|vR6AwIppaa	brendan.<br>  <br>  that would be SO cute!<br>  <3<br>  <br>  <br>  p.s. don't listen to the first girl. trying to make people jealous by going out with someone else can be mean and hurtful, and you would be "using" him.|`|Xj4JLlcEaa	go for brendon :)<br>  don't wait around for a guy<br>  i done this for about 3 years and its a waste of time<br>  <br>  so choose Brendon cause it would be ace<br>  and would look lovely lol :D|`|dfCcCJ6Uaa	if you like cameron more, then don't get with brendan because you will realize you still have feelings for cameron and it will all become a mess. trust me its happened to me.<br>  talk to brendan and see if he really does like you, and then talk to cameron and see if he still has any feelings for you.<br>  i hope this helps x|`|JwkFpy04aa	Well pick whoever you like more. When cameron breaks up with his GF then you ask him out. In the meantime dont ask brendan out bc then Cameron will know you have a boyfriend so he will probaly stay with his GF right now. If he does like you he probably would ask you out by now... so my guess is just stay single unless you REALLY like someone else. And just F.Y.I you really shouldn't date someone just because they have the same features.(no offense) really I am not trying to hurt you.|`|Wz67xSgfaa	well cameron has a girlfriend soooo...i dont think you should be picking cameron.but if you dont like brendan that much then ii dont think you should be picking him either.|`|0SREhTB2aa	Well cameron seems to like someone else.<br>  You can find out what brendan really thinks bout you then make a move. x|`|XYvBdLlXaa	well, since Cameron now has a girlfriend..<br>  there is really no point in liking him.<br>  you should just staart talking to Brendan(i like his name:p )|`|43XMaKKbaa	one has a gf so its quite obvious who is left in the jar for you.
M3pufPlnaa	yeah.. she don't sound that bad! <br>  tell her to stop swearing in every sentence,<br>  especially not infront of your parents or teachers!  <br>  and if she makes fun of people tell her not to, and if she don't<br>  it has nothing to do with you. Does it? try to stop it thou <br>  So hang out with her, and if you have a good time become <br>  friends if you don't find someone else :)<br>  Hope this helps :)|`|QDUCi0TKaa	its never ok to make fun of people or to swear why don't u talk  to her about it|`|doScx2qnaa	Give her a shot just because she cusses alot doesnt entirely mean she a bad person but i dont know her. It could be just the way she was raised.|`|dAJSz9Skaa	Hmm...<br>  Well she sounds like fun but i see what you mean..<br>  i think you should talk to her and tell her that swearing makes you feel a lil uncomfortable..<br>  Also mayb she hasn't ever had the right friendship to learn not to be so mean...mayb you could teach her?<br>  If she disses someone, let her no thats nawt kewl..<br>  But be a friend at the same time!<br>  Also find her new friends too, don't make yourself her number 1!!<br>  Iv bin in that situation way too many times!<br>  It may be a lil early yet but if you get sick of her later, she'll cling to you because she won't have anyone else and you will only end up hurting her and making yourself seem like a ***** to other people!<br>  <br>  Hope i helped!=]<br>  -xoxo
hprR6qfHaa	I can't give you common sense, and I can't help your friend, but there are a few obvious solutions.<br>  1) Tell her father.  Do it now.  Do not wait.<br>  2) Tell the police.  Do that now, too.<br>  <br>  She will thank you later for both, I promise.|`|sI6fcIV4aa	Try having her go to the police first. She has every right to. It is assault to kiss someone who doesn't want to be kissed even if he did not move on to sexual assault.|`|peybb4Foaa	There is no evidence so yeah there is actually no point in it.<br>  She should of went to police immediately not go home and cry on phone.<br>  <br>  With no evidence police cant do Anything.<br>  If the guy just randomly starts to kiss a girl on the street then well he has no prob to lie to the police.<br>  <br>  <br>  I would of found out who he is and kicked him in the balls so hard that he will become sterile.|`|mldo1vxYaa	I dont know if it sounds like he tried to rape her, yes what he did was wrong but is he stupid enough to attempt to rape someone with all his friends present?? Anyhow if she doesnt tell her father you need to tell him, just tell him everything you have said here, start by saying you have something to tell him and your friend didnt want to tell him because she is too scared, then just tell him what happened.|`|Xg2WmhPSaa	She needs to get help when she is ready|`|JJARLh3zaa	talk to her again and ask her if she thinks her father will believe this guy over his daughter. the guy has no proof|`|452l3uU8aa	This is bigger than her parents, <br>  this is a matter for the police. <br>  You need to convince her... <br>  and if she dosnt budge..<br>  you have the choice of doing the right thing<br>  and being a good friend. <br>  sometimes doing the right thing <br>  is more important, because it envoloves her saftey<br>  and others saftey..<br>  mabye the next girl wont be able to escape...|`|dHAuIg8caa	This friend should understand that her parents are her best friends at this point. She should inform her parents because if she doesn't, it will prove to be an obstacle in her future life. Please, girls, don't be afraid to tell the truth. Parents understand you best cause they've given you birth.|`|Uo2HyF5faa	okay.now this is a real problem. yes, u should tell her father.from now never let her go anywhere alone.someone must be there to follow her.if u are the one,be careful yourself.he might even target you.make sure a trusted adult knows about it.this matter is serious.|`|4etHo5eXaa	aww|`|tE0QbKQYaa	Does your friend know this guy? She must if she new his age. Either way this should not have happened so yes she needs to tell her father!! I would talk to your friend and explain to her that you are worried and u care about her. Let her know how you feel and just be honest with her. Example: Amy (whatever her name is) I am really concerned about you and I feel you should let your father know what happened. If she says no. Then ask her why do you not want to tell him? If she is scared then say "Amy if you would like me to be with you when u tell him I will be glad to or offer for u to both go and maybe you can help her by telling him." The most important thing is that she needs to tell her father and u need to be a good friend and continue encouraging her to tell someone and be there for her!! <br>  <br>  Good Luck and hope all goes well!

You are asking on here about something so personal that it just proves you are immature when it comes to love, sex and emotions.<br>  Why did you lose your virginity so young and how many men do you plan on sleeping with until you marry and have babies ?<br>  Remember your past always creeps up to haunt you and instead of worrying about ridiculous things you should concentrate on learning to love yourself and stop giving it up so easily.|`|IPS3hWweaa	Trust me, if he loves you, he isn't going to be worried about what it looks like down there!

Ask him to use some whipped cream if you want to be sure he finds you tasty and if it would make you more comfortable.
i9nlUZb0aa	I believe that you should be total honest with the social worker, tell her everything that you can. And then ask her what you can do about getting some kind of custody of the kids so that they could be with family instead of a foster home or whatever. As long as you are honest, show that you care and are willing to go the distance to help the children they usually will work with you. Good-luck

94idwoK2aa	Sexual harassment is when your wife tells you your not getting any tonight because you told her her *** looked too big in those jeans....that's sexual harassment!|`|GQJbOblQaa	Sexual harassment means talking to someone who is not interested to hear about sexual matters.  It could be a boy or girl.  Stalking somebody, show abusive signs, talk vulgarly, sending indecent mails or making abusive phone calls etc., can all be termed as sexual harassment.  <br>  <br>  People who nurture positive thoughts never hurt their partners and harass them in any manner.  Where there is true love, there is care, concern, sacrifice, mutual respect etc.  <br>  <br>  One must learn to behave properly in a civilized society and not harass anybody.|`|GZg0io3uaa	Sexual harassment is unwelcome attention of a sexual nature and is a form of illegal and social harassment. It includes a range of behavior from seemingly mild transgressions and annoyances to actual sexual abuse or sexual assault. (Dziech et al 1990, Boland 2002) Sexual harassment is considered a form of illegal discrimination in many countries, and is a form of abuse (sexual and psychological) and bullying.<br>  <br>  The term sexual harassment began coming to public attention in the 1970s, starting at a "Speak Out" in 1975 in Ithaca New York, USA. For many businesses, preventing sexual harassment, and defending its managerial employees from sexual harassment charges, have become key goals of legal decision-making. In contrast, many scholars complain that sexual harassment in education remains a "forgotten secret," with educators and administrators refusing to admit the problem exists in their schools, or accept their legal and ethical responsibilities to deal with it. (Dziech, 1990)<br>  <br>  for details do visit..|`|qeNrGoMsaa	Anything that is sexual in reference to a person. ie spoken, touched, written, etc.|`|iWJ3BQQ9aa	you can't touch it keep your hands to yourself.

IPS3hWweaa	You need to follow your heart. If you can stand to be friends with her, then I say you should keep her as a friend despite the fact that you feel more for her than she does for you. But be ready when she finally falls in love with another guy and you see her going out on dates with him and not you. If you can deal with that, then stay friends with her. If you can't, then you'd better tell her that your heart wouldn't be able to take the pain of seeing her with someone else.<br>  <br>  Have a serious chat with her. It could end up clearing up a few things between the two of you.|`|v6KSGrlJaa	If you remained friend zone it' cause probably she likes someone else and sometimes it's not better to give her all you got cause girls like to have things they can't have or romantic stuff and most likely your not fullilying the role|`|Jsvvm4qsaa	I say you should just remain friends with her. Just back off the flirting and the talking on the phone so much.|`|u8MOrhnvaa	F no|`|AA11725982	its up to you|`|0KXiwjDbaa	Soldier, love is war and your heart is the battle ground.  Are you still doing stuff for her, giving her money, or buying her stuff?  Have you considered that she may be a “double agent?”  That is, she may not want to cut ties with you even though another guy’s flag may be in her tent.  What does your training tell you, soldier?  Can you not see that this is an extreme tactical advantage for her?  Soldier, I am talking to you!  Your position has been compromised, why have you not aborted this mission?  Drop and give me 50, NOW!  :)|`|vngsb5MVaa	Maybe you should give her a little time to be alone... you know.. let her think about what she wants..if after a while she still doesn't know... well then don't keep wasting your time and putting yourself through that.. my friend is waiting for a guy like that girl and my friend is waiting for nothing at this point..she drives herself crazy  thinking that he is gonna spontaneously ask her out.|`|pqdIwbwQaa	I think you can be her friend even you cannot be her boyfriend.|`|9tE1PDxWaa	i think you should stick with it for now and don't give up, but at the same time keep an open mind for other girls who give you the same feelings|`|Nt4csAXGaa	Absolutely! There's no reason not to be. And besides, if you can't be with her the way you want to, being friends is the next best thing! If you really really like, do what your other friends tell you and don't let go. There's really no reason!<br>  <br>  I'm in somewhat the same situation, except I just really really like him and I'm friends with him. No, I have not asked him out, but... oh you know what I mean! Lol!<br>  <br>  Also, don't give up on her yet, because maybe she likes you, yet she's not ready for a relationship yet. It's understandable in girls. Some of us are confusing, while some of us are straight forward. Give her some time, and maybe after a while, she'll start to think about wanting to be more than just friends with you. But don't pine after her and wait until she says yes. Play the field a bit and see if any other girl has the same feelings about you. Keep an open mind and don't be dead set on getting this one girl if you don't think it's going to work out<br>  <br>  I hope this helps, and do what you think is right in this situation!

Don't give up on her, just be strong and have respect for yourself. She is probably messing with your head, and mixed up herself which is normal given the age/hormones/growth spurts/family background etc. she will be drawn to your indifference and will want to speak to you eventually. Let her reach the point where she wants to talk to you. Allow her to come to you. When she does, be interested in her emotions. in the meantime, focus on other girls and expand your horizons and have lots of fun. This will help your self esteem and just send a message that she doesn't know what she is missing.|`|WhlwZeiXaa	no are you crazy.<br>  and you sound 12|`|GmTMVmASaa	don't be a fool, you will eventually get over that love and find someone that deserves you. she couldn't even tell you herself? comeon now, read beetween the lines.|`|7XGjs8cyaa	i dont think you should, well not this soon anyway, wait a couple months before you ask her back out but between now and then show her you can be interesting.|`|nYEkkNn2aa	no you shouldn't ask her back out since she dumped you. you should wait for the write opportunity. or wait for the right person.|`|PlRYgRcoaa	Hell no, find a new girl mate, rub it in her face.|`|mwW4zIwIaa	Looking at the reason... no.<br>  You should get over it, not sob over it and think you're the best thing in the world for her.<br>  She knows what's best for her.

I am sure that a girl who is very hyper and kisses you randomly and again, dumps you randomly after one hour is not anyone shy.|`|2KAqLbqiaa	Your girlfriend shouldn't get people to dump you. That's not cool. But I think it's cute that you really care about her and want what's best for her. I think that you should ask her back out. There aren't a lot of guys like you around, anyway.

A LICSW would help you resolve the relationship issue(s).  The psychiatrist will give you something to help you sleep, level out your emotional state.  The person is gone and you need to let them go, more importantly you need assurance that it's not your fault.|`|AA12185240	I have cried my self to sleep many nights when it happen to me ,but I tell you this each day get better and before you know it you don't think of it as much life is to short you deserve better|`|aErUKUvVaa	Go out and get urself some strange man....  fresh panties will be ur sleeping pill
PEVkrOVVaa	You are only giving your point of view.  What about the girl, does she care enough for you to stand up to her mother, and tell her that she loves only you.  You are giving up before even trying.  Maybe you can talk to her mother and ask her why she is against you, and what you can do to make her like you better.  You haven't even give it a try, and you want to quit, this is not love, it is a easy way out, by just giving in cause the mother does not like you.  There must be somthing in you that she sees, that she does not want her daughter to have any relationship with you.  So the best way is to ask, but first make sure the girl you love is strong enough to help you as well, otherwise if she is the type who will only listen to her mother, and go marry someone else and leave you.|`|Zm1ucL0zaa	u will never forget her like this . insist her mother . tell her that u lv her alot  and u people cant live without each other. its not easy to forget ur love . if then also u want to forget her . stop thinking about her . make new frnds . avoid her . try to make urself busy by doing some work in which u r intrested .|`|E4ySrE6Xaa	If u really love her let her go if she comes back to u means she is urs if she doesnt means she is not urs.|`|qdmhtzuVaa	talk to her mother..make a scene do sth and change her mind .....|`|qwXNl0n2aa	if u really love her u can't forget her!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>                                    sorry to say!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|YYLlAXfgaa	if  u looooooove her so much... try convincing her mother... there is alwasy a way.....

3ggolLgQaa	Wow that is pretty messed up. <br>  <br>  Firstly let me say I have been there! My situation is a little different but I totally understand what you mean. I have a friend who would buy the same cloths as me, her facebook page is almost identical to mine, she would say things that I came up with and act as though they were her thoughts/ideas. The only difference is my friend admires me and even though she acts like they are her thoughts/ideas, which is what annoys me hardcore, she never says anything malicious and is a good friend. Yours on the other hand sounds very very jealous of you.<br>  Its pretty obvious! When you ask her what the problem is, she cannot give examples because there are no examples! The only thing you have done wrong is be yourself and being independant.<br>  This girl is not independant at all and obviously cannot think or function by herself. She sounds really clingy and insecure.<br>  Did her boyfriend break up with her? If so, it has probably made her insecurities stronger. She is thinking she is not loved for who she is and therefore is helplessly copying and trying to be someone else in hopes of being loved and accepted. She wants to be you. Do u have alot of friends? If you do, there is even more reason for her to be jealous of you.<br>  <br>  Think about what this girl has brought in to your life. Has she had any positive impact? Does she bring anything to the table?<br>  <br>  If not, it shouldnt be so hard to leave her behind.<br>  You tried to be nice about it but it didnt work.<br>  If she is bringing you down, let her go. She needs to stand on her own 2 feet and grow up! Do not allow yourself to be her safety net. Friendship is a 2 way thing.<br>  <br>  Good luck with that :-)|`|TXToyWXJaa	I have one like that. But we're both 13. She copys everything and gets credit for things I do. When I confronted her, she passed the blame on to me. I just firmly said, "No darling, it's not me. Your life is just messed up, and I'd appreciate if you didn't mess up mine too." Then I walked off.|`|fgM3fPdcaa	HI <br>  MY ADVICE IS TO LEAVE HER ALONE ,MAYBE EASY TO SAY BUT CAN ALSO BE EASY TO DO.<br>  SHE'S YELLING AND CRYING ,WELL GUESS WHAT SHE MAY HAVE DONE TO BECOME AN EX-GIRL FRIEND TO HER MAN.<br>  DO YOU REALLY NEED THE BAGGAGE?<br>  <br>  PRAY FOR HER AND YOURSELF,WHY YOURSELF BECAUSE FRIENDSHIP IS ONE THING BUT WHAT TO DO ABOUT A FRIEND IS NOT A FRIEND!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  DON'T TRY TO DISTANCE DO IT.<br>  IN A RESPECTFUL WAY.<br>  TELL HER THE TRUTH ON WHY YOU CANNOT BE HER FRIEND.<br>  I MAY EVEN HURT YOU TO LEAVE HER AS A FRIEND BUT TIME WILL HEAL THE BOTH OF YOU.<br>  <br>  <br>  GOD BLESS<br>  AND<br>  GOOD LUCK|`|8NBq70JPaa	This exact thing has happened to me. The girl was jealous I had gotten married, bought a house and was having a baby. Where her boyfriend was a loser and her family hated him. I can't really tell you what else to do but be nice and slowly distance yourself from her. It is not okay for someone to be so hurtful to you, especially a friend. But if she is acting this two faced to your face she probably is acting worse with your mutual friends. It did not work out for me since she was telling everyone how jealous she was after we stopped hanging out and really putting me down to everyone. They all have to work with her so they avoid me now because of it. Just be nice and keep any of these thoughts to yourself or she can make you out to be the bad guy. Don't worry there are many people out there that are deserving of your friendship, remember the best form of flattery is copying.
PVaVhZ1jaa	i dont think so. a month and a half is perfectly fine to begin falling in love with someone.<br>  i think you should write a poem to her telling her how much you love her!!<br>  peace,love,AJ|`|IXdz6mmLaa	well..do you usually fall for girls this fast?? if you do then probably dont truly "love" her...but im going to be honest with you.. i think you should tell her in person..and when the time is right..theirs nothing worse than having a girl tell you back..."ohh but..i dont..really...uhmm....feel the same....im sry....i just like you right now..." BUT! i dont know this girl..maybe she feels the same way..like shes in love with you too..you should know bro...see how she is around you and everything...if she loves hanging out with you...if she talks to her friends about you a lot...stuff like that..you know?...ohhh what you can do is be very romantic with her one night (dont over due it..) and at the right time when you got her eyes shining on you and only you.. let her know how you feel....and im pretty sure she would feel the same..|`|0KXiwjDbaa	You are right; a month and a half isn’t enough time to fall in love with someone.  The things you are learning now are going to determine how successful your relationships will be when you are an adult.  That is why it is important to date as many different people as you can while you are young.  When I say date, I mean go out and have a good time, I don’t mean sleep with, okay?  The more people you date the more experience you have with dealing with different types of personalities.  Plus, you will also learn a great deal about yourself like what type of personalities you are compatible with.  <br>  <br>  Right now, dating should be just about having fun and there shouldn’t be any talk about falling in love or being exclusive.  If you are in High School, you should know that kind of relationship is neither practical nor possible.  If you take the relationship too far you can wind up with an STD or unwanted pregnancy and ruin both of your lives.  Keep things simple, keep things fun, and don’t worry about all the crap the other kids are saying - - they don’t have to live your life or deal with the decisions you make - - you do! :)|`|AA12185240	Don't rush just enjoy each other company you'll know when to say it|`|IRikuHx4aa	Defently not. I fell in love with my boyfriend after a month, or maybe even before that. And look, we've been dating for 6 months. But yeah, I also believe that writing a poem to her about how you feel would be perfect. If you're not good at poetry, you can also look up online for some help. Or get advise from an English teacher. They can always help. Good luck, hope things go well. (:|`|mwW4zIwIaa	What?! No!<br>  You start to date people because you begin to like them. You don't just start falling in love with the person after you start dating. Or do you mean deeper in love?<br>  <br>  Tell her how you feel. Your true feelings. The feelings you get when you're with her... That you truly love her.|`|5fIBXX7gaa	look its hard to express yourself but the best way is to just respect her in all ways tell her damn you look sexy or kiss her check or forhead to show affection man it's so many things you can do stand behind her rub her shoulders hug her anything that shows attraction|`|VOMRvvkcaa	well, first u need to know that love comes everywhere hehehe and u can't get off of it!! haaah!!<br>  second if u love her just tell her that u really love her n that u want to be with  her cause u have a crush on her...!!
m9L1iPSWaa	There are things you can't share with your family. You have your own secrets that you can only share with the closest friend you have. You trust him more than you trust your family.<br>  <br>  But there are situations when your friend lets you down. He disappointed you so much, that you feel you'll never trust someone again. You keep thinking that until you meet another person you would like to be your friend. If he lets you down, too, there's nothing left to do than staying close to your family.<br>  <br>  You must to know that your brother or sister, and your parents are the only ones to help you when you need it the most. They give you the best piece of advice because they are more experienced by the age they have. And they want only what's best for you. Your family never betrays you. They will stay there. So, you are welcome to ask them for whatever you need. They will certainly help you.<br>  <br>  It's a good thing to have friends. But, at the same time, we have to keep a close relationship with our parents. We should be aware of the fact that no friend can be a substitute for a family. Both family and friendship have to take certain different places in your life. You mustn't make a confusion between or family and our best friend.|`|Ta2lNKUVaa	You are stuck with your family, because you did not choose one another. It was inevitable, you share the same blood.<br>  <br>  However, friends are always temporary, almost disposable, because there is nothing holding you together.|`|JRZSuKLSaa	You can choose your friends but you can't choose your family.

Tell him the date/time/place and that you will go with him. Tell him how he feels may be caused by a physical reason, like low blood sugar, anemia, thyroid, and it's important to have a physical done. Scare him by telling him he may be having diabetes and if it's not checked he may become blind or impotent. I know it's using the fear factor but men will go to see a doctor if they think they have an ulcer but not for depression. Once he's at the doctor and he talks about how he feels the doctor will catch on.|`|Q2UDhYgkaa	Don't try to stay away - he needs your support. I would encourage him to speak to his regular doctor - depression is a medical issue not a sign of weakness so I would suggest to him that he wouldn't refuse treatment if he had cancer so why should he with depression.<br>  <br>  Make sure you give him lots of affection. Even if you don't want to be around him he will appreciate it because people with depression feel like no one wants to know them anymore and often avoid others when they really need their support.|`|jBigEy0Caa	You need to get him into the doctor.  They have medication that can help him and he needs to find out the root of his problems.|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	Being depressed is one thing.  Being lost and bored in a marriage is a serious thing that I would be scared to face.  Give him an ultimatum.  Let him know that you will be there for him but he has to be there for himself too.  You can't spend the rest of your life being frustrated.  What kind of relationship can grow with depression, being lost, boredom, frustration and guilt?|`|AA12185240	Do you know why he is depressed ,try and find out and then ask him if there is any way you can help|`|MMOwlLw3aa	well u tried..id speak 2 his family and get them 2 help because its not fair on u

f8ON3dRfaa	Guys are seldom emotional creatures, they are more "thinking". If he feels that you're hiding something, your actions or speech may have given him that impression although it's totally innocent on your part.<br>  <br>  What you can do, is to ask him "May I know, what did I do or say to give you this feeling that I'm hiding something?".<br>  <br>  You'll be surprised that the things you do innocently, is interpreted differently on his end. <br>  <br>  I like it when you make the effort to want to strengthen the trust issues you face as a couple, and I do want to give you help in anyway I can. Very seldom, people have the desire to make any relationship "last forever". With today's culture, it is a question on "how long can we last" instead.<br>  <br>  Therefore, communicate with him, get him to talk, find out what is it that is giving him this impression of you and either work it out on your end, or come to a compromise on how to deal with it.<br>  <br>  Blessings!|`|NP98ui6xaa	if your being truthful, it will become apparent after a while that your a good girl.. but if your screwing around.... it will make its way to the surface like a pimple.. lol <br>  its the truth. i hope i helped.. just tell him to relax and youll prove it to him that your being true|`|hSy8ZKRXaa	I'd be suspicious of your boyfriend's motives. Often these suspicions are either a smokescreen to cover his own activities, or are a sign of severe paranoia. Both of these scenarios are bad news for you. Stand back and have a good close look at your b/f and your relationship. Somehow, I think your desire to have a lifelong relationship is blinding you to some serious issues your b/f has.<br>  I may be wrong, but have a look anyway and reassure yourself.|`|0SREhTB2aa	Hunni Im in the same situation aswell.

Suggest counseling.I think it's a good idea for bot of you, if you both really love each other!!|`|IRikuHx4aa	Most guys are like that. Usually the thing that causes that, is from their past. They've probably been cheated on before, or left for some other guy. What you could do, is just not talk to other guys that much and try to show him the most attention. When he wants to do something with you (such as a date, eating, etc,.) go for it. I'm sure he'll be more comfortable with you after awhile.

IRikuHx4aa	Maybe you should ask him that question. Ask him why he hasn't asked you out yet, since he says he loves you. But don't fall for the "i love you and only you" stuff when he would talk to other girls. Also, maybe he might be shy to ask you right now. Most guys actually do get shy just like us girls do. If it gets to the point that you just can't take it any longer, ask him out. :] I'm sure things should go well.|`|AA10150551	Hmmm.... that's weird. Do you know if he's a player? Normally a guy who does that just wants an ego boost. But I am not judging him, all I am saying is that you should observe him more. Be careful too, because he might be showing your texts to other people and brags about it to others. But I am hoping for the best.... maybe you are not showing him you're interested in hanging out with him in the first place? I hope this helps. :)|`|VABATohgaa	well you could ask HIM out.. if he really does love you he will most likely say yes! but dont do it over text. do you know him in real life? cause it wold be so much more approprate to ask him face to face. you say you text all the time... do you not talk to him face to face? make sure your both ready... and he will.. soon probably unless hs jsut trying to reel you toward him? i uno hun sorry but just keep it up for a phew days,  also if you havent already tell him you love him! that could have a big impact and he might think you dont love him back that could be the problem x|`|qOVMZWMpaa	I had the same problem before Christmas. We used to text each other every day and he told me that he liked me but I waited ages before he asked me out. <br>  I made the first move in pushing him towards asking me out. I think you should send him a flirty text or maybe hint something towards him asking you out without it being too big of a hint. I think guys are insecure and want to make sure that you feel the same before jumping in and making a fool out of themselves if you say no.<br>  xx
DBJyxAexaa	It's corporal punishment. It's a spanking. That's all. Hey, it's better than grounding!|`|a8e2130188e45facab4c16a4a764104caa	Yep, CORPORAL punishment.

Corporal punishment goes by a variety of names including, but not limited to, "beating," "hitting," "spanking," "paddling," "swatting," and "caning."|`|FATyhyZ2aa	That's Corporal Punishment.<br>  From "Corpus" meaning "body"<br>  Bodily punishment. Spanking.  <br>  Opening the can of "Whoop @ss"<br>  <br>  HIDE! Or come up w/ a very good apology stating what you did wrong & why you NOW see it was bad & how you will prevent this action in the future.  Hint:  Have on padded clothing during this talk.  3 pair of jeans, layers your shirts, etc.
llT8Prtiaa	First of all give her hints to let her know you have not forgotten your anniversary.  "Two years seems like two months, I am so happy with you", love talk, know what I mean.  Plan a get away for the two of you. Get a nice motel for the weekend.  When you book the room make sure to put a big bouquet of roses and chill the champagne or wine.  Dinner sounds nice also.  Pack her bag.<br>  <br>  Build up the excitement!<br>  Happy Anniversary!<br>  Contessa|`|CSh4QiCPaa	why on't you try somethin different and romantic.. like a book of love poems but not one you would buy from the shop.. make it.. get a really nice looking blank book and print out poems maybe in different colours.. and stick them on the pages maybe add some tasteful pictures... <br>  <br>  or a picture album kinda like the above, u make it.. <br>  <br>  i've always thought if u make somethin.. somethin that you have done it is way better than somethin u jus pick up and buy from a shop trust me she will love it !! xx|`|BmUeJkP3aa	There is a website that has traditional and modern gifts that you can give for the number of years that you are married. It is great and gives you ideas as to what you should do.  Take a look at it. there are other sites that are just like this one. Do some research. Find the best gift that you think that she will love and adore you for.|`|09k5GLLkaa	How about a male stripper? Wow, I bet she would love that. <br>  Just kidding.......Take her out to dinner with candlelight and all.<br>  Some jewelry may be nice.

NwVwZ8Tjaa	Yuck.<br>  Workplace affairs are on the rise. You obviously have a gut feeling she is cheating and she probably is.<br>  Since asking her is not going to help, I suggest you surprise her at her workplace.  Go find out what is going on there.<br>  If this fails, hire a PI.  Be careful of what you seek.  If your gut feeling is true, be prepared for the worst time of your life.|`|OkXN7gmeaa	likely a discharge. possible she is more active or sitting a lot at her PT job.<br>  if you feel she is cheating on you ask her. you should be able to tell if she is lying.<br>  also maybe her mood swings and increased discharge are signs of pregnancy.|`|Jk9jPNeLaa	AAAAAAAAAHAHAHAH, darling, its called discharge. all women get it. it is body fluid which cleans the internal part of the vagina because we can't clean it ourselves.|`|KZlgdMeEaa	as a general rule wen a spouse is cheating out of guilt they become overly affectionate and not cold towards the unknowing spouse...|`|jBigEy0Caa	You don't have anything to worry about, perfectly normal.  Stop looking so closely at her underwear.|`|AA12185240	It may just be a discharge all woman have this|`|0PdYYeBFaa	Just a discharge|`|NiPuaY0Saa	its a discharge|`|Pe3lyyxoaa	it's not from having sex on the side.it's called a normal discharge that most women have ..you can have as much sex as u want and your undies would still be clean...however this doesn't mean she is not cheating on u....if you have that feeling she is probably cheating...why don;t you ask her straight up..?|`|09k5GLLkaa	You Panty Sniffer.......<br>  She is probably screwing someone<br>  OUCH|`|47rEPGVfaa	She's probably having an affair cause her husband keeps going through her dirty underwear?! Just an idea|`|d79f7930cb1bdfed3fecbe4604200019aa	Why you checking her panty's? Just get up enough Balls and ask her straight out !!!!!!!!!!!!|`|9E54gDcLaa	One! All woman get that, some get it more than others. It is called Discharge honey! Second, she could be getting a yeast infection. I think you are worrying too much about it. She should however go get a pap smear just to make sure it is the normal stuff. I just want to stop you from thinking it is *** or anything like that right now!!! And if she gets it more when she is at work is because she probably stands alot at work!|`|pVnUhYLQaa	I think she should be worried; she has a husband who is inspecting her panties. Women get vaginal discharge. She may be cheating or there may be one of a half a million other things wrong. I don't know, but stop inspecting her panties dude. Try talking to her.|`|498JdszFaa	Panty sniffer. I would be short tempered to you as well if you did that. Talk to her if you think something is wrong. Maybe she'll tell you what you're doing wrong sexually (or not doing at all). Maybe you'll find out you are making things up.|`|llT8Prtiaa	All women have a discharge, however if it is a thick white substance she may have a yeast infection which can be caused by several things including stress, medication, tight clothes, etc.  Going through your wife's dirty laundry by no means can determine if she is having an affair.  Sit with her and tell her you've noticed how she has become a little pensive with you and how you would like to some how solve the problem because of your love for each other and the kids. Leave the dirty underwear to the dogs.<br>  Stop sniffing, start talking!<br>  Contessa|`|a8c906f035c0cce8ff4eddf99b310e3daa	Apparently you have had other suspicions of possible infidelity for you <br>  to start checking underwear. That's usually the last resort.<br>  <br>  Read below some of the more tell tale signs of cheating. <br>  <br>  You are not by yourself in having a cheating spouse although it may seem that way to you. Get a PI to start checking for you for proof. You<br>  will need that info in the event of divorce.|`|fMEypXDYaa	The stuff has to go somewhere, you need to find out who's stuff it is?

Try to distance yourself at him (hard but you can do it bit by bit)<br>  2. Try to erase his name -in your notes, post its, emails, friendster, etc. anything that will remind you of him<br>  3. Go out and watch some movies - just to distract your brain from thinking about him.<br>  4. Or read some books<br>  5. Talking to a trusted friend helps to get over him<br>     It may be hard at first especially if you're friends with him.. Think it over why you want it to end, having an inspiration is sometimes healthy for us but then if it is too much, you gotta stop.The best thing i did to forget him is by thinking of all the negative traits he have (he must have!)a nd just focus on it. If we had a huge crush on a person, we tended to be blinded with his faults..this time focus on it.|`|i9nlUZb0aa	If you really need to get over someone, then the best thing to do is leave them alone. Wait to see if he calls, texts or whatever. You don't want to sound like a stalker or have him feeling like your going to be a thorn in his side cause you cant let go. Let him make the first move. Then you'll know one way or the other how he really feels about you. Good-luck|`|AA12265794	Sweetie, i don't think you can fall out of love. You say EVERYTHING reminds you of him... but listen to this... in your situation i think that even if he stabbed a person and went to jail for it... and after he got out.. still stabbed people... you would still love him a tiny bit... so i don't know... find someone better.. or better yet... tell him your feelings.. maybe he feels the same way? Anyway... Hope either way... your happy with your decision!~|`|RyYV3aXlaa	I don't know my self, but if you want to get a hold of my last 3 ex-girl friends they seem to have it down pretty well...one day every thing is fine......and the next day I'm to the curb.......(can't be me ?)|`|5MKD1DfBaa	why do you want to get over him? just because he lives far away?<br>  just find other ways to visit him like bus or train? bike? you know.. :)|`|IytPJbv4aa	if you guys are best friends you wont. but it takes time and you need someone there thatll help you get over them.|`|IOWzXL9qaa	Fall in love again|`|CpevWaQ7aa	Try break contact with the guy. I know its hard but its the only way. Try keep yourself busy. Find new hobbies etc. Good Luck
QttAOneaaa	Um wow what a jerk. I guess its one of those commitment things. He wouldn't actually do anything with you because then he'd need to be a good boyfriend, and yet hes asking you, his best friend for a picture with her top off. That's ridiculous.|`|lFzFtiCBaa	I understand that all this is is pre-teen drama. The kid wants a pic of your boobs to jerk off to, ...if you're his best friend then hook him up, what's wrong with you.|`|vR6AwIppaa	woww <br>  troll.<br>  <br>  <br>  like anyone would want to see you with your top off.|`|PpYl2dFVaa	maybe he has morals|`|wLMtLuGaaa	Yep. He's mad because he didn't get a nude picture to masturbate to, and (according to his point of view) you "criticized" his ability to become aroused around you or other females. This is one of many examples that show adolescent guys tend to be a bit over the top when it comes to sex. Don't worry about it. He'll get over it.|`|IRikuHx4aa	Haha, yeah, you did the right thing. He's not after you, he's after sex from you. I can tell. Any guy that would ask you that, even after you say no, then yeah, they defently just want sex and that's all. If it gets to the point you can't take him acting that way, anymore, then get rid of him as a friend. Tell him you can't take any guy that'd act like that.|`|0SREhTB2aa	You did the right thing and didnt give him a picture.<br>  If you arnt going out then why give him pics like that?<br>  He was proberly bored at that time so he asked for entertainment.<br>  Dont stress too much about it<br>  Your better off being friends with him. x|`|XYvBdLlXaa	well your both a little weird.<br>  but you should never ever ever ever ever<br>  send pictures, trust me even if the guy<br>  says he won't show anyone he will..<br>  and the pictures will go around to everyone.|`|0Sro08acaa	You should've taken some explicit images of you getting rogered by a couple of guys and sent them to him...would've sorted it out a treat.|`|pbUUFbMCaa	Are you a guy? if so your gay and you have a gay stalker freind.|`|okONxml9aa	I think he just wanted to see if you'd really do it.<br>  <br>  you did the right thing.|`|QP8LdPLeaa	boys always say they wont show anyone. he seems like the type that would back in the locker room and brag about it to his buddies, or receive 50 bonus for being able to achieve getting a naked picture of you. do you realize that when a guy asks for that kind of picture from you, he only wanted one thing the whole time? why else would he want that kind of picture? i highly its for a souvenir. your reputation could have been ruined and the picture could have been passed around.<br>  <br>  the reason he got mad and cut you off was because you kept shoving the question in his face that he wasn't comfortable answering. didn't you notice he kept avoiding the question? i would have logged off too if someone kept hounding me like that.|`|hlvdPjeFaa	firstly its 'have' and not 'of'.  i dont understand that speak. and secondly, i think youre both a little weird. why would he want a topless picture of his best friend and why would you talk to him about sex like that? how old are you guys?
aWEybdDFaa	For heaven sake, you're not married to anyone, it's consider dating. Date as many as you want-just let them all know that its an open relationship.<br>  <br>  This way you can choose who u want to date serious--down the road.<br>  There is a reason why she's your ex, so keep it like that. Why go back to old mistakes, when u can make new ones|`|QP8LdPLeaa	Dihan, you're ex lost your trust and that was her fault. do not hurt the your current girlfriend just to give your ex another chance that she probably doesn't deserve. now you SAID that the girl you are with now REALLY likes you. you may have some regret like your ex does with you.|`|hlvdPjeFaa	if there's no future with her you shouldnt put too much thought into the relationship. as for your ex, dont get back w her if you dont trust her as theres seriously no point. enjoy your relationship w the new girl for now but when you find someone you can actually have a future w, it'll work out for you.|`|2S2onP86aa	Trust really matters. So if you still can't trust her then don't go back to her, unless you want to give her another chance, because everyone needs another chance, so I say try it. And if you know there is no future with the current girl, then why be with her in the first place unless you just want to be in a "fling" and just play around? <br>  <br>  So it's your choice, but my advice is, try to give you ex another chance, or find someone else other than your ex or your current girlfriend. Gotta pick. <br>  <br>  Good luck and keep your head up.|`|DM6YyuoJaa	well obviously you have feelings for your ex right? just because she came from a messed up home dosnt mean she is going to end up like here lowlife parents if your not happy with the girl your with now you said it yourself there is no future then just simply tell her this isnt going to work out and go be with the one you love lifes short|`|jNGdtQDSaa	depends if you love your ex, if you really do then you should break it off easy and slowly with this one and get back together with her.<br>  if you don't really love her, don't. there's a reason why the 4 years were tough and why you broke up with her. if you're happy right now, don't go back to her.|`|PpYl2dFVaa	do whatever you want to do your not married|`|0SREhTB2aa	I dont think your ex wants to have you in a relationship.<br>  She proberly misses your comany since you were there for her in her tough times.<br>  She needs a friend and thats what you can tell her. you can tell her that you would be her friend and thats all.<br>  If you've never trusted her then why be with her?<br>  If you think you have no future with your girlfriend then try to figure out why. There must be something. Isit becoz of your ex?<br>  I personally think your ex needs a friend and her current boyfriend proberly isnt looking out for her so shes running back to you. x|`|CDMTteeYaa	Who do you think is better in terms of loving, caring, and understanding you--especially who you can trust more? Well, if you think you that you are already happy with your girl now, then stay with her. I think the past is the past. I know i'm saying this, even though i myself want to go back with this guy, because he's still living me hanging. I suggest you think it thoroughly, and then decide.. :)|`|mwW4zIwIaa	Be with the girl you already have.<br>  If your 4 years with her were rough, why do you think that would change? I think she's just really desperate, and she doesn't like people leaving her because of her past. She's just going to put a collar & chain on you.|`|3ce6d9c9e3f848056cc7c6236e1cb143aa	Sounds to me that you aren't sure about what "you" want.

MM7yqP1faa	I've actually never had a boyfriend and I'm in college. It does suck at times, especially when you compare yourself to others, but it sounds like you're happy with your life. It's hard to find a relationship, it's hard to be in the same place at the same time with any guy. Sometimes your crush just doesn't feel the same way, and sometimes you just don't really get a vibe from anyone around you.<br>  Be patient, stay true to yourself, throw yourself into other parts of your life while you wait for this one to fall together. I know it's cliche, but when it's time, it'll happen. Keep searching, keep striving, but in the meantime, don't feel ashamed of your life and who you are. Embrace it.|`|CXSVaiBMaa	be proud im 16 never had a bf but did hav my first kiss and sort of wish i hadnt it was not as special as i wanted n he mostly just pressured me into it. ur 1st kiss should be special and u should remember really liking the guy... wait till ur ready and its the right guy, and dont let someone pressure u into it|`|mDMnhqwdaa	You should be proud, your friends are naive.|`|t74mM7Wvaa	We call this pure pressure.  If you can resist it you are more like an adult.  Although even as adults we fall into it from time to time.  Just cause the "cool" kids say it is cool does not make it automatically true.  Go at your own pace, and do what you want, not what your friends think you should be doing.
498JdszFaa	Good luck.|`|llT8Prtiaa	A good place to start is the internet.  Type your city, passport informaton in a search engine and see what comes up.  the court system is also a good place to start.<br>  Contessa|`|09k5GLLkaa	OUCH.....Sucks doesn't it?

What's wrong with developing and growing in who you are, without a man.  Take some time for you, further your education, be a great mom to your child and then see what comes your way.  If you are happier and less stressed without your husband, then perhaps its time for divorce if you have already tried to work things out.  Good luck and be happy|`|d234166d8f863dd6e9d713ea30ebef8aaa	geeze 7yrs and you still dont know! do what the **** you want
L2AWPUVXaa	Cause she is afraid that you will treat her like a friend just because of her sickness. YOU NEED TO GO TELL HER THAT REGARDLESS OF HER HEALTH STATUS, YOU WOULD ALWAYS BE HER BEST FRIEND. THAT WOULD BE REASSURING OKAY. !!!!|`|QvhPJAKyaa	shes been diagnosed with something that could, sorry, kill her.<br>  think how she must be feeling. she's probably just giving up, and doesn't want you to see her like this. <br>  just keep your fingers crossed that shes going to be okay, and be there for her after her treatment.<br>  x|`|QP8LdPLeaa	Lacey, when someone is sick, that's a very personal thing that they prefer no one to find out. now you said she's known as being tough. as a cheerleader she probably didn't want people to know that something was bringing her down. i can understand why she got upset. i wouldn't want to walk around school having people know that i got brain cancer. would you feel comfortable with that? if she never told you in the first place, why bring it up? it should have given you SOME message that never wanted to talk about it.|`|JVPwpwYlaa	because she feels now she can not trust your words or actions to be anything other than pity...I was the same way when I was faced with a life threatening illness...I told no one as I wanted their honest thoughts and words...once they know your ill you are never totally sure whether what they say and do is out of honesty or pity.|`|4SyYpBChaa	shes freaking like dying and she didnt want to hurt you!<br>  she was being a good friend and i honestly think you should have waited for  her to tell you, shes in a real serious situation and probably didnt want everyone treating her different.!|`|T0pkW783aa	I know it is difficult for you to see your best friend this way.  Can you even imagine how hard it is for her?  She may have been in denial; just hoping that this terrible diagnosis was not real.  She wanted to live her life as normally as possible without having to deal with explanations, sympathies being expressed, friends drifting away because they don't know how to handle it, etc.  These types of situations do happen and she didn't want it that way.  She is still dealing with all that has been given to her and she may just need time.  Give her space, send her notes of encouragement and let her know you are always there for her, that your prayers are with her every day and that you will love her as much as you have ever loved her; unconditionally.  I know that you think she knows that, and she probably does but she is dealing with something so major that she is having some really bad moments that she is not yet able to share.  This has nothing at all to do with you; more to do with what she has ahead of her.  Being extremely ill with a very serious condition, and also having to deal with the often tiring and miserable treatments with some nasty side effects is a hard enough situation; dealing with life with no real answers about what is going  to happen and maybe even how long you will be around has got to be the most frightening and life changing experience I can think of. Knowing that your life may be much shorter than expected is so scary.  She sees her home, her family, her friends and imagines how many life changes they will go through that she may never experience.  The dreams she has always expected to take place may never come to be.  I can't even comprehend how hard this would be to deal with.  Every card and thought you can express with love and compassion will help her.  Don't be offended for something she cannot help.  She has to deal with this the best way she can and that may be that she needs the time alone right now.|`|rypsRNs0aa	Dear Tracy, I can understand both of you so well.  Your friend thought, that if you didn't know, you would be your normal self when you talk to each other as though nothing was wrong with her.  She hasn't accepted herself about the brain tumor, therefore how could she expect you to accept this and be yourself. she didn't want your pity, she wanted you as you have always been.  I think that shows that she regards you as her best friend.  People who didn't matter to her that much, she could talk to about it, but you were special.  You on the other hand, thinks, she should have told you, but see it from her side, you might understand.  I too have had cancer of a different type and have got over it, but when I first knew, I didn't want my dearest friends to know. I know this sounds odd, but one feels, one lets the other person down for some reason.  Give her time, she will get round to talking to you again, maybe you could leave a message for her, and say, if she wants to talk or see you, you'll be there for her, whenever. Please accept her current state of mind, and let the future decide.  I know it's hard but I am positive, she'll come round and see you again.<br>  All the very best to both of you.|`|FATyhyZ2aa	Dear, it's very hard to process the fact that one is facing their own mortality.  This one is not about you.  It helps to keep sane by keeping everything else in your life as normal as possible. I suspect that would include the joy of your friendship & not sadness b/c she has enough of that on her own & with her own family.  Until she's healed or other, give her the gift of happiness that she has shared with you.|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	She is scared to death, does not want to think about it, if that is at all possible. Also she is pulling away, I am sorry to say, in case she does not make it. She also does not want people acting different around her, or feeling sorry for her. She is trying to be as strong as possible threw all this, but that is damn near impossible.|`|eNl8GhPUaa	i'm sure it has nothing to do with you. the poor girl had a lot to deal with thrown at her and she's probably scared as hell. just let her know that you're still there for her and give her some time to deal with this. good luck.|`|UtCkgs18aa	Well, that's very hard to tell, especially to someone who you care about a lot. She probably knew it would devastate you and she didn't want that to happen.|`|J9pbhleBaa	Be gracious to her. She has obviously gone through a lot. Jesus wants you to love her, and to love Him!|`|uXsZKag5aa	well thats sad but she might dotn want you 2 get hurt|`|tbbWp18taa	First, im very sorry for you and your friend, you two are in my prayers..<br>  She probably didn't tell you because she didn't want you to worry<br>  And/or she might have thought that if you knew you wouldn't be her friend.. And/or she thought you might tell someone and then everyone would know. It's understandable that she would want to keep that from you.. And when she said she needed alone time she was probably      meaning  she didn't want you to worry and she's probably VERY depressed by the news because shes so young.|`|uwCcIY8Aaa	Sometimes, people are not sure how to tell others of their flaws, or problems. She may be your best friend, but even through all the fun times and special bonds, it is still hard. She might have tried on multiple occasions but failed to due to your reaction. It also could be so serious that she wasn't sure how to tell you that there is a possibility of her dying. She could be one of those types of friends that would rather have you not know, just like everyone else. So you are enjoying the time you have with her, and not worrying about how many days left. She may just want to deal with this on her own, and as drastic as that sounds, some people prefer it to be this way. You just have to be there for her, and apologize. Say you love and care for her and you'll always be there. Don't ask questions, just be there.|`|kau1P97Kaa	i'm sorry to hear what happened to your friend, maybe why she never told you is because she was too scared to tell you and doesn't want no one knowing what's happening to her, the best thing you can do for her is be there for her, she needs you at this moment, so be a good friend and take care of her.|`|VSASkXQ7aa	She thinks you'll have sympathy towards her instead of a normal friendship. Give her time..it'll be ok. Just treat her normal..and not like she's a patient. that is all. Good Luck!|`|cfzsUsYRaa	i might be able to answer your question she didnt want you to feel bad she didnt want to hurt your feelings she might need space for a while|`|j0aeAUs9aa	She didnt want you to hurt or worry.  You are lucky to have a friend that cares that much x|`|2OyAJxcFaa	She's been goin through a hard time and I dont think she wanted to talk about that...you should give her some time...mayb you should of not mension that you knew about her cancer and waited for her to tell you..Just let her know that regarless her situation that you love her and care for her..that  you always have and it would mean alot to you if she would let you be there for her...try and be understandful..shes in a sensative situation...I hope everything gose ok...Good luck...also praying might be helpful|`|M8uQ3LS7aa	becuase she is scared! you think its hard for you imagine what shes going threw a million thoughts are racing threw her head. obviously you guys are good friends and she loves you very much and she didnt want you to worry or hurt, but of course your going to hurt and worry though, you got to understand thats a big thing to find out about. when my mom found out she had cancer she didnt answer the phone for 2 weeks and just laid in bed, it really drains you too and to think about anything that could happen. Im sorry about your friend. if all else fails pray. try to stand beside her threw it though.|`|nhkvvHFKaa	Because she doesn't want you to treat her any differently. She values your friendship and was most likely scared if she told you you would treat her like she was weird or too fragile or any number of things. Everyone else is acting different around her probably, but she wants your friendship to remain something stable in her undoubtedly chaotic world. Let her know she is stillt he same person to you, and if she ever needs anyone to talk to you are there. But other than that it is probably wise to not try to talk about it with her. It will always be on her mind, as her friend it is your job to try to distract her and remind her that there is more to her life than cancer.

If a Catholic is marrying a non-Catholic, they are still supposed to be married in the Catholic church, or the wedding will not be recognized by the Church.|`|rlUUaSgqaa	You can get married in a non-denominational church, and you will be considered legally married by the state.  The Catholic church may not recognize the marriage though if that is what you are concerned about.|`|LCAzlHhEaa	If you want the wedding to be recognized in the Catholic church then you must be married  in a Catholic church or have the wedding preformed by a Catholic Priest.  Otherwise in the eyes of the church you are not married.|`|AleWgjvPaa	So long as your partner is a baptised Christian then the two of you can marry in the Catholic church. But you will need go to a Pre-Marriage Course (all Catholic couples must go to one) and the non-Catholic partner must agree to have any children brought up in the Catholic faith and to not block the Catholic partner from worshipping as a Catholic. <br>  <br>  Some priests might not want to perform a full nuptial mass (i.e. with the Eucharist etc) but a Catholic marriage ceremony can still be performed. And not having the full nuptial mass will stop the non-Catholic's from feeling left-out. Go and talk to the parish priest and he will tell you all the small details.|`|sAu3dGB8aa	Get married outside...hire a non denominational officiant...it kills me how the church preaches marriage as the moral way for a couple to live together but than won't recognize it when they do...vows are vows..no matter who you say them in front of...all the best and congratulations:)|`|gfEQbww0aa	Are you mentally handicapped?

6Rru2901aa	To make things get better you gotta do what he said: give him some space. Just reading your post you sound like the clingy type who calls every minute to check up on what he's doing and to find out if you're still together, and want to spend 5 hours with him everyday.<br>  <br>  *breathes* you have to give him some space, not only for him, but for you as well. It sound like you're not taking care of yourself and that's not his fault. You're still in a relationship, but the way it's going seems to me that if you don't give him his space he'll soon dump you.<br>  <br>  Clinginess is not a good quality in a women. Men want to know that their girl is independent and in certain sense that she doesn't need him to be happy. By getting away and letting him miss you you'll gain some respect and he'll show you how much he need you. If you do so and he shows no sign of interest... ?You've officially been chopped and screwed? - Sorry :S<br>  <br>  Take care and good luck,<br>  <br>  Moe.|`|mefxIQP9aa	You guys aren't together anymore if he said he needs space.<br>  <br>  He probably wants to mingle with other chicks. If he's young, you can't expect any better from him. Not many young guys want to be in a serious relationship. They mostly want to have fun and not be tied down.<br>  <br>  Don't beat yourself up, hun. Go hang out with some girls and have fun. If he sees that your depressed, he'll probably think that you're the clingy type and have no independence and that's a big turn-off for most guys.|`|uWJJyNR3aa	move on. he just wants to be able to makeout/ or f*ck you while being free. he is honestly and completely using you.<br>  <br>  if you still like him, then move on and don't let him treat you this way. <br>  act like you don't want him and he will want you more.|`|hEcKmleVaa	If a guy is telling you he needs space, he means it.  He still wants to be your friend?  Maybe he should act like a friend and give you the courtesy of defining the relationship and not leaving you feeling confused and sad!  I would say you are NOT with him anymore, and that needs to be YOUR decision.  Don't let guys leave you in limbo and don't let them use you as a convenient friend.

AA11356400	Get tough gal! From what you've said I really don't think there would be too much you could say or do at this point to embarrass him. Some people you just have to hit in the head with a brick. Tell him he could gag a maggot and he needs to bathe and wear clean clothes as long as he stays there. How could he get a job smelling like a puke? Answer....he's not looking and doesn't want one. Tell him that everyone that lives there has to work unless they are infants and he's not. He has to pay his way in cash, not domestic help. You didn't take him on to raise. Where are his parents or family? Wonder why he didn't go to them? I know why. He's probably been there, done that and pretty much burned the bridge. Give him a time line and plan of action and stick to it. Wouldn't you rather have alone time with your fiance before leaving for that year? And, why would your fiance want a roommate that doesn't work and obviously lacks the very basic of human cohabitation courtesy? I think you're going to end up being the "bad guy" here if anything is going to be done.|`|e640e5fc04f1c4da3326c5429e707bdcaa	This has to do with your boundaries. If you are planning to share the rest of your life with this man, you absolutely have to establish your boundaries and what you expect in the relationship. Trust me when I say that there is no romance when a woman becomes a mother to a full grown man. Often, we naturally step into this role without noticing that we have suddenly stopped allowing romance to be the main element of our relationship. Yet without romance without the male-female give and take, without the partnership of nuturing each other and respecting each others boundaries, you are giving away your rights to be loved and cherished. <br>  Time to re-think where you are at, and what you want. Figure this out on your own, perhaps stay at a friends or magically "win" a girls spa day {wink-wink} so that you can be by yourself and really reconnect with what is important to you. <br>  Then call a meeting alone with him and lay out what you need. Let him be a man and take care of keeping you cherished and respected. <br>  If he can't then you know it is time to move out or kick them booth out. Tough love.|`|aZXnW6AUaa	You have to discussthis  with him very seriously

8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Weirdly, not those things.  My son will pick a flower from the neighbor's bush walking home from school, walk in and lay it in front of me without a word.  I honestly cannot tell you where he got that, because his father left before he was 2.  Of course, I've been given flowers on occasion since then, but not many and not often.<br>  <br>  I think the teachers in pre-school and school do a great job of helping the children remember Mother's Day, also.  Kudos, teachers!<br>  <br>  But with just day to day appreciation?  Saying thank you for the daily meals, clean laundry, nice home, sports, Scouts, the extras that many children of single parents do without, he's terrible.  Takes me completely for granted and is often demanding.  lol<br>  <br>  I think boys need to SEE this from a man--it's "nagging" from mom.  Great question.<br>  <br>  Btw:  I'm really blessed to have very good friends.  My gf's husband takes my son shopping at Christmas and he picks out a present for me and she and I go to a Christmas party (been doing this for years).  Also, my current bf took him shopping for my birthday.  Very cool when friends and family step in.<br>  <br>  Oh, I thought of this thing (your questions make me think lol):  There was this father in our church who would come pick up my son for father/son baseball games and take him with his sons.  Unfortunately, many women feel threatened allowing their husbands to do things like this--so, wives, don't.  Anytime a GOOD man intervenes in the life of a fatherless boy, he's helping society and our future.  GOOD women will never take this the wrong way or try to break boundaries.|`|sLLgERQWaa	lol when my ex took a hike my father was there, as well as my sister's husband, to be the role model for my son and my 3 daughters on how a real man and husband/father should be.....<br>  ...and my Da never lost the chance to remind them all how hard I had it, and how I was sticking by them and doing for them.<br>  <br>  Little notes? he's your Son, Kiddo, not your Husband. Drop the little notes sh!it as it sounds weird and questionable. However, he does need to show his appreciation of all you do for him by acknowledging you on Mother's Day & your B.day......presents are NOT nessesary, either. Wow.<br>  He needs a male role model...only another man can teach him how to be a good one. Good luck.|`|09Y8F6hQaa	I think you teach this by how you treat your sons.

JhOcPHEsaa	Honey well let me help, first of all, my advice is to stay calm.Families always fight no matter what there is always a debate with every family while making  a choice or when something is ruined.Families fight sometimes for little stupiditities,dyfunctional things going in the house or outside the house. you got to stay calm an let things get solved alone.If it keeps going on i would suggest you ask advice to a therapist but dont believe in everything they say because they are not always right all the time.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Talk to a teacher, or to your school counsellor.|`|RvoT3ttXaa	you and me both.|`|q3J3CeAxaa	Are you sure there is no one you can talk to that can help you get a therapist? I don't know if its really possible because of age and insurance. Depending on your age the first thing I would do is talk to the school counselor. Tell him/her the problems you are having. If its something that needs more help than they can provide they will help you get someone with out your parents knowing through the school. The second thing I would do is confide in someone you know you can trust. A close friend or family member. When My family went through tough times I really bonded with my brother and we helped each other. If you don't have someone like that to talk to the third thing I would suggest is to get into a SAFE chat room and talk to peers that you don't know. Hopefully they would be willing to offer advice. DO NOT give any personal info tho. I really hope this helps. I have been in your shoes and it does get better! Good Luck.|`|QzU0jJYMaa	you need to confront them and let them know that if theycontinue tofight they will loose you cause it is driven you crazy.

pR0pJNJkaa	There are two things you need to understand. <br>  1. Women are people. Don't allow this to be such a daunting task by viewing her as this amazing girl you want to be involved with. You have to break the ice by talking to her as a person, a fellow student. Think of how you talk with your friends and apply those principles to talking to her. It will make it a less imposing task. Also, find an area of similar interest and talk about that (which leads to my second point).<br>  2. If she is always with her friends...it may be to your advantage to befriend one of those friends. a) the friend will be an awesome mouth piece who will communicate your greater qualities. If a girls friends think you're awesome it's more likely she will think so too. b) This friend can be your inside track to find out what her interests are and how you guys may have common ground or if this is even worth your time. c) It won't be so obvious that your trying to talk to her when they are in a crowd and you can talk to your "mutual friend" and just end up talking to her.<br>  Hope this helps.

For all you know she could be interested in someone else. If you ever talk to her and she doesn't show much interest, leave her alone. I mean, you know you are going to break up with her to go to college. What's the point? Its going to be over anyways.

MuSYw7m3aa	here's my advice:<br>  Steps<br>  Be kissable. Use lipbalm, especially if your lips tend to get dry and chapped. Soft, silky smooth lips are simply more inviting. Most importantly, nobody wants to kiss someone with a stinky mouth, so carry some breath mints or gum with you, especially if you’re going out on a date. Breath mints are preferable, because you can use them in a pinch and not have to worry about getting rid of them. Also be sure to stay well hydrated: a dry mouth usually will smell worse. Of course, make sure you don’t have anything stuck in your teeth, either. <br>  Test the waters. Pay attention to signals that the other person is into you and is ready for a kiss. Does he or she seem comfortable touching you. Do they brush up against you or frequently enter your personal space with playful, innocent touches. Has the subject of kissing or love come up in conversation? If you haven’t noticed any of these signals, but the person does seem “into you,” try discreetly and innocently breaking the touch barrier (guys will generally be very receptive to this, many girls will not) or bringing up kissing when you’re talking. The key is to be subtle and to watch the other person’s reaction. <br>  Wait for the right moment. There’s usually no hurry for a kiss, especially a first kiss with someone, so be patient and wait until the mood is right. Some good times are at a romantic movie after or during an onscreen kiss, walking in the moonlight, or during a particularly intimate conversation. Wait until the two of you are alone so that the other person will feel more comfortable and so that nobody will see if your attempt to kiss is rejected. <br>  Get permission for the kiss. You usually don’t have to ask if you can kiss someone, but you do need to make sure your partner is willing to kiss you. The easiest way, of course, is to ask, but it just makes things awkward so don't . Ask “May I kiss you?” or say “I’d like to kiss you,” and lean in right away. Many girls (and guys) don't want to be asked: they prefer that you be confident enough to take a risk and just go for it. One way to do so is to stop whatever you’re doing and silently look into the person’s eyes for a moment or two. If your partner’s eyes drift down to your lips that’s a pretty good sign that he or she is ready for a kiss—chances are the reaction may be subtler, however. Another good way to get permission is to just lean in and try to kiss the person or gently pull him toward you for a kiss. If the person pulls away at any time, he or she is not ready for a kiss. <br>  Approach for the kiss. Approach slowly and smoothly. Depending on your starting position you may need only to turn your head, or you may need to lean in a bit. You may want to use your hands to gently urge your partner’s body or head into position—you just want to guide his or her movement a little, you don’t want to forcibly move any part of his or her body or hold your partner in an uncomfortable position—but in general you just want to position yourself correctly and let your partner meet you. As you near your partner’s lips, maintain eye contact. You may want to close your eyes after your lips meet to heighten the sensuality of the kiss (and to avoid staring at the pores on his or her face). <br>  Kiss gently. There are many kinds of kisses, from quick pecks to sweet, passionate kisses. There’s a time and place for all of these, but your first kiss with someone should be gentle and romantic. Don’t press your mouth onto your partner’s--just let your lips meet--and don’t try to push your tongue into his or her mouth. A soft, closed-mouth-to-closed-mouth kiss is perfect. Break the kiss for a moment, keeping your head close to your partner’s, and if your partner moves to kiss you back or seems to like it and doesn’t pull away, go in for another, longer, but still gentle, kiss. <br>  Make the kiss the reason for the kiss. A lot of people (mostly men) seem to treat kisses as nothing more than a prelude to something else, and will try to quickly move into French kissing or start putting their hands in inappropriate places. Good kissers concentrate on the kiss, and they kiss, at least seemingly, expecting nothing more. Enjoy the experience, and don’t move too fast. <br>  Let your partner participate in the kiss. Good kissing requires give-and-take, so read your partner’s body language and pay attention to clues (sighs or moans) that tell you you’re doing something he or she likes. Let your partner kiss you back, and move with him or her as long as you’re comfortable with what he or she is doing. <br>  Breathe. If you’re kissing for an extended period, it’s easy to forget to breathe. Gasping, however, or turning blue is not romantic. Take small breaths through your nose as you kiss. You do not forget how to breathe! <br>  Use your hands. While you should keep your hands polite, especially on a first kiss, you don’t necessarily want them just dangling at your sides. Embrace your partner, cup his or her face very gently in your h|`|6Rru2901aa	If you're kissing someone who've kissed b4 just follow his lead.

Im sure EVERYONE says that but it does help and the little line that helps me out is the fact that everyday and minute and second.. its getting easier and closer to forgetting.<br>  Just dont go back.

She's trying to ruin your life by driving your friends away so that she can have you all to herself, like you're her pet or posession. I think you should tell her that you are not impressed by her nastiness, when you have tried to help her and be nice to her and that you are not going to be doing it any more.

It's flawed logic to think that you can't get pregnant if you exercise a lot. Exercising in an excess amount will sometimes deregulate your period (make it happen less frequently or occur for shorter periods of time), which makes it more difficult but not impossible for you to get pregnant. But constant, obsessive exercising is sometimes indicative of an emotional disorder. It's just like having an eating disorder. You may have an unhealthy body image if you are working out enough to deregulate your period.<br>  <br>  First of all, your parents do not have to know if you want to go on birth control, that is something that you can discuss with your doctor privately, unless you are under the age of consent. In which case, you shouldn't be having sex in the first place. If your boyfriend isn't "special" enough to you to be the father of your child then A) you shouldn't be sleeping with him, and B) you shouldn't let him *** inside you without the protection of a condom. Even birth control and condoms aren't enough to make it 100% impossible for you to get pregnant. You can get pregnant even if he doesn't have an orgasm at all. It only takes one sperm. <br>  <br>  You don't want to have a baby right now? Not ready for that responsibility? Then you're not ready for the responsibility of a physical relationship.

But maybe if your parent's don't know maybe you shouldn't be doing it. You seem a little too young to be even thinking about pregnancy. You can not take care of it at such a young age. I'm sorry if i sound mean but I know someone young that had a child. It didn't work out. Their body wasn't ready, and it didn't survive. So maybe if you are having sex use protection at all times. And yeah, it may be good to have a talk with your mom.|`|b0ee365a07d7e8aa39352cf614463f42aa	ok for starters if you are asking this question I am not even sure that you are mature enough to be having sex but since you are...Yes you can get pregnant. Even though extreme exercise will cause someone to loose a baby once pregnant, your body is used to this kind of exercise so it has adapted to it. I would highly suggest going to a planned parenthood office and getting on birth control. You do not need your parents to get it from those offices. Trust me its better to get on it rather than get pregnant.|`|cxA9bQGtaa	you can still get pregnant even on the pill or patch or shot or the ring. if you arent ready for kids dont let dude bust a nut inside you.

5687JygEaa	You guys really need to communicate more, you should tell him what you just said, and if he doesn't understand then take it slower. Don't worry about your clock ticking, thinking about that is going to make everything worse. You have to be patient and honestly its only been 1 year, after one year guys don't really commit right away. They want to make sure its right. As for you being alone in a city...well have you ever thought of exploring more? join a group, go to community volunteering, there's a million ways to meet people, and believe me once you do start making friends, life for you will be much easier, and you won't notice time as much. So if talking to your boyfriend doesn't work....then back off a bit see what he does.<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  <br>  <br>  plz answer mine: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AhJM6cPUQOFN6FI0BiyBBa_sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307085443AAg8qJv">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|PpYl2dFVaa	i give up too long|`|b3GZB3Wyaa	You've been together for one year.<br>  <br>  It's obviously not right to get married after only being together for one year, especially as it's long distance (you hardly know each other)<br>  <br>  Stop being a control freak and be patient, you have quite a few years to wait.|`|tKr8rIZ0aa	Long distance relationships are hard to keep a spark going. and if he's having a hard time on his life, then maybe marriage will be really hard due to costs, you guys also havent had to deal with the stress of living together, you need to see how you guys handle and cope with problems together in the same roof, its really selfish for you to think that he should leave his family/DAUGHTER!(which should be the most important to him!)<br>  <br>  I hope you really love him, and are just not in it for the citizenship. =/|`|mefxIQP9aa	It's only been a year. Calm down. The ring costs money, you know. You actually have to put a down-payment on that thing.|`|xGRh8k2Baa	You haven't even lived together, only knowing each other one year will not prepare you for a marriage, especially if it's been long distance.  Keep dating him and wait a while, wait until you can be together and actually know whether or not forever will work for you.
Z9jlS2bUaa	i think you need to end it.. you can do so much better, trust me. I've had guys do that to me too.. but only when we're in the talking stage... not when we're actually dating. A boyfriend of 3 years behaving like this?!? No way.. not acceptable. At this stage you should be talking marriage not playing silly games. Get rid of him.. trust me, you're wasting your time. If you cut it off from him cold for a while, he'll either move on or he'll come around (at which time you can decide to give him a second chance.. but only after you make him suffer a lot).|`|t9rOvMVuaa	He is a bad person or a person with serious psychological problems and you must get away from him. Do not follow his game. Just leave the relation, tell him you feel sad, you feel the need to cry all the time and you need to take sometime to find out what is going on, because you don`t want to pass your unhappiness to him. Of course as time passes by u will keep playing same excuse till he does not call you anymore.<br>  Bab guys or guys with psychological problems do this things.|`|5fIBXX7gaa	well im not a guy but i sure can tell you that sounds really familiar and he is sharing his tim with some other female if he can't give you his undivided attention more than just a couple days at a time|`|TepR1rACaa	You are more than likely a backup not meaning that he has someone else but you are someone he can converse with when HE has the time (not making the time)<br>   <br>  I think you have wasted enough time on this guy, really three years? I think that is more than enough time for you to be patient with him. <br>  <br>  This honestly sounds like a crappy friendship rather than a crappy relationship. Next time he calls tell him friendship is give and take and you are not about to sit around and wait for him to call you or make time for you. You're done, then go about your business.
xGRh8k2Baa	I'd definitely say move on because if it's not going to work out now it's not going to work out ever.  If there is some reason she doesn't want you right now, why will it change in the future?  I could see if she was going away for a year or something and wanting to wait then, but unless there is a situation you're leaving out it's probably best to move on, good luck!|`|GdjfU5Saaa	just tell her how you feel and say you don't want anybody but her and you don't want to risk losing her. Hope this helps!|`|x1XFQ43Raa	i'm a girl, and my advice to you, is move on. <br>  it might be hard, but from the sound of it, you need to. <br>  you mentioned you'll be seeing her in 3 months, so i'm guessing she lives further away? don't waste your time on one girl, yeah you may be in love with her. but, there are plenty of girls out there to love. don't get yourself stuck on one, unless your in a great relationship. best of luck! (:|`|7NbG4gnRaa	Hey! High five me!!!! I'm in the same sad situation, except I haven't been told to wait, I just know the guy doesn't like me. Sucks, don't it?|`|8290750de398a0cfad0df45a64d531c3aa	move on
JtfTJDHLaa	i dont know man!!! im a girl and i would definatley want it..but then again i would think that you were hitting on me and it would bug me for aa long time..just becasue she parks to you doesnt mean she likes you..could mean that shes just tryingto be nice..but if you guys enver talked..then DONT DO IT!!! give it to another chica!!|`|C9vcHbnVaa	put the gift in the car, and write a note into saying, " Do you Remember the Time, we were dating and you wanted this gift i promised you, so i just saw it and it give me flash back during our time together. so here is your gift i promise you. you don't have to say thanks or anything, i just want to give you the gift i promised you for a long time."<br>  <br>  Your Friend or EX (your name)<br>  <br>  God Bless|`|MxkV14fXaa	if you want her back, give it to her. if you don't, give it to someone else.|`|HJbZHS2uaa	forget about it!!!<br>  <br>  8 months ago and you havent talked??<br>  If you gave it to her it would seem like you want her back|`|vWBHYwdxaa	Don't do it .|`|FTDjW6OFaa	break into her car and put it on her seat|`|sLDqymHzaa	Well you already bought it... you might as well give it to her. Just leave a note with it that says "don't think I forgot" or something like that. If you wanna be friends with her sign it either "friends? -[your name here]" or "your friend, [your name here]. I'm seriously doubting you want to be anything more, but if you do it's up to you to decide what to write. I'd stick with the above, though.|`|SpCihawgaa	yes
AkTw3RQuaa	What you see is what you get<br>  You have allowed this for 3 years (no passion, romance etc)<br>  Why take it for 20 Years in marriage?<br>  Why did you no speak up in the first year ?<br>  Do You want all that "Hollywod love"?<br>  You cannot change a person..don't try<br>   A blind person would have been able to note that this man is not the romantic type in the earlier [art of the relationship;<br>  Some people are SERIOUS & don't go for all that romance novel stuff<br>  You knew this for 3 years not 3 days !<br>  You blind ? You desperate ?<br>  Is he a good person ? Has a job, drug free ?<br>  Expect the same if you have kids...no passion etc<br>  YOU decide..because YOU decided on staying in this relationship for 3 years|`|mefxIQP9aa	You say, "No."<br>  <br>  Seriously. That marriage would just suck balls.|`|498JdszFaa	I agree. Chemistry seems to be missing completely. Unless you are fine with that, I would try to find a better match.
ygGr1nX7aa	I wouldn't force the issue.  When she's ready for you to know, she'll let you.  Until then, there are plenty of other ways you can subtly show her that you're aware she's growing up, without ever mentioning it directly.|`|i9nlUZb0aa	I think that you should sit down and have a talk with her, without letting her know that you were told. Let her know that you love her and will always be there for her. And if she ever feels the need to talk about anything you want her to know that its ok. That you'll always stand by her right or wrong.Then tell her about your first crush and kiss, and how old you where when you got your period etc. And then ask her if these things have happened to her yet and that she doesn't have to feel ashamed to talk about it. Good-luck|`|04Te5gzzaa	Why embarrass the girl?  If she wanted to share with you she would have but instead she told someone who is the same sex as her...her auntie.  Guys just won't understand the emotions and feelings of going through that so she will share the experience with someone who would.  Don't try to be her older sister or her mother...you'll never be able to fill those shoes.  Just be her older brother and that should be enough.|`|RvoT3ttXaa	eh I don't think that would be a very...comfortable...situation dude.<br>          dont' worry if she wants to tell you she will tell you. just don't bring it up, as long as she has the supplies and her aunt knows, then theres no problem. <br>   <br>     let her deal with her own personal stuff.|`|WnWO1iHSaa	Obviously if she didn't ask you any questions, then she knows how to use the products, etc. I would let her know that you know, and that she can come to you with any questions she may have or if she just wants someone to talk to about it. Hope this helps.|`|6lL4hwM6aa	You are her brother. That is not something you tell your brother. It is very personal and embarrassing. It is none of your business if she has her period. But I understand that you want to be there for her. <br>  <br>  Sorry for your losts.|`|sE2RH0A7aa	Duuude..<br>  She's you sister, of course she doesn't want to tell you. Don't say anything, you'll just embarrass her.|`|KfKr3hUmaa	HAHAHAH FAIL.. No, are you retarded?|`|tEr0WcTDaa	I'd never tell my brother. It's just not something you'd bring up in the conversation. I understand you're very close, but if I were you, I'd just leave it be. Don't be worried. She told her Auntie, which means she's not trying to hide it or anything. It's probably just something she doesn't want to share with you right now (what with you being a guy and all). If you really think you need to intervene or help, then I'd just go buy some pads and put them on her dressing table (in a bag, of course, to save any unwanted embarrassment). In my honest opinion, I won't say anything to her directly. It can make for a really uncomfortable conversation.|`|bP6tE3anaa	the best thing you can do is let your sister know that you are there for her if she needs to talk, tell her that if she doesn't want to talk to you then suggest another female member of the family like your aunt.|`|QPdYQeUkaa	You should tell her how to do it properly because she may do it the wrong way and have some problems. teach her how to do it and leave her alone.|`|RfWQfF1Haa	thats not something she would probably want to tell her brother.<br>  Don't be offended.<br>  She's a girl.|`|cmK9Go1gaa	She's probably jsut embarassed...let her tell u|`|TdAhuAQqaa	Well i am sorry that she lost both her parents but it's private when a irl goes through her periods and her peuberty i am ten and i have a fifteen year old sister i am getting my period soon and she doesn't feel comfortable when i ask her about it or when she has it...so i depend on my friends when you go through those kind of experiances sometimes most people go to their mom or sisters or people who are close and are the same sex i suggest not bringing it up it won't change anything expect making it akward she's still going to be the same person just sometmes people with periods may be emotional or have cramps it's different for every person so i suggest getting ready she doesn't really know what to do probably so I suggest to stay out of her personal business she is going to feel a little embarrassed and don't even bring it up i don't even like bringing it up with my family i just talk to my closest bestfriends also if your aunt is giving you the 411 then i suggest ignoring it because someday your sister is going to find out and get upset and embarrassed and thereis a chance of making your relationship with her akward wait until she comes to you for help don't come to her....<br>  <br>  hope everything works out!! it'll mean alot if you chose me as best answer!!!<br>  <br>  sincerely, been there, done that|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	She was probably a bit embarrassed about tell you. You could mention that she's becoming very grown-up and mature, but I don't think that referring to her period directly is a good idea. If she had wanted to tell you before now, she would have said something herself. I would leave it to her to mention it.|`|htWw0OlCaa	Its kind of a difficult moment for a girl going through that. Im sure she felt embarrassed to tell you. Talk to her and tell her that you understand. Best wishes|`|b7ff0c6859d6ba5cc891050de578e39daa	Give her plenty of opportunities to tell you herself.  Take her to the store to pick out feminine items and tell her that she will need them soon if she doesn't already.<br>  <br>  As her guardian, the sex discussion will have to be started by you. Good luck with that.|`|xreWOKBYaa	I would just let her know congratulations! She has reached a very big point in a young woman's life, let her know if she ever needs you to "pick something up from the store" for her, you are always available!|`|Ict5JA4eaa	she'll probably tell you in time, let her say something|`|xnrGEJZQaa	well just make sure she gets some money every week incase she ever needs the neccesaties like pads n what not n dot make it obvious or this will wrekc ur relationship n she will be mortified with the imbarassment!<br>  soo just let her go shops on her own now coz she wont want to go with u to get pads - trust<br>  so just give her some freedom now and shes a girl she wil lget angry and youll no why and comfort her a bit more now so she doesnt feel more streessed coz when on a period a girls is allways annoyed irritated or extremely relaxed<br>  so let her do her on thin but keep ur self in her life
BHEDSILWaa	Playing hard to get? Well, you guys probably need some time. Its best if you guys settle down first :]|`|dq7nvrfhaa	He is your ex for a reason,It sounds best that you keep it that way.<br>  If he wont reply there is a reason,and hard to get is never a good one.|`|WW0k3PMnaa	If he gets mad at you and ignores you, then he is not worth you investing any more time in him. You deserve better, so find a new guy that will treat you the way you deserve. Leave your ex alone, and if he wants to be your friend, let him come to you.
DpYILbsZaa	Thats how many guys she's BEEN with.|`|Hj5LZSUUaa	uhh i know a few girls that wear a bunch of them around their neck.<br>  <br>  im in high school and have never heard of it standing for that O_o but ive asked them about them and they say its just cuz they look cool.<br>  <br>  so some are just for the style|`|ErmcT4uUaa	I think that's how many guys she has had over your house while you were out.|`|PpYl2dFVaa	wow i forgot about those
cDRXtuJCaa	Have you proof i take it to the cops( if he know you been there tell him you lost your purse) If the kids live with you then it a empty threat but if they are with him he can make it difficult but the laws on your side <br>  I ask for any orders to stop this man having any contact and if you can keep gathering  info the police should be able to stop him under stalker laws good luck <br>  keep a personal alarm|`|u1uECuFNaa	Yes, you are being stalked.<br>  Blackmailed.<br>   I think that is part of the stalking.<br>  You need to talk to the police about it. Or move. <br>  I wish I could be of more help..<br>  How will you have nothing?<br>  You need to talk to someone about this....<br>  soon...before it escalates out of control.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Call the police and get a restraining order. That is the definition of harassment. If you see someone following you and taking pictures, call the police and tell them there is someone following you and photographing you<br>  <br>  As for your children, he can't make that decision - only a court can. If you have a court order granting shared custody then he can't keep his children from you or he could go to jail. If he does try to prevent you from seeing your children, you need to contact the court immediately<br>  <br>  You and your daughter do not have to tell him anything about your personal life. It's none of his business. If he tries to call and talk to you about anything other than visitation of your daughter, hang up on him<br>  <br>  Keep going out as usual and call the police whenever you see someone following you. If you are with other people, point it out to them so you have witnesses. Keep a log of every occurence so you can show a pattern of harassment.|`|3iNobwVraa	Grrrrr.  That's it.  Just grrrrrrr! >:||`|0PdYYeBFaa	Sounds like a bitter lost the plot man...be careful.|`|09Y8F6hQaa	Honey, smile for the camera!  Honest to God, why would you play into his games?  Do you really think a court would give him full custody because you were at a bar with some friends, or on a date?  Get real!  He can throw his temper tantrums all he wants, and he can't take your kids away unless you abuse them and that isn't happening.  Tell your daughter not to answer his questions and if he continues to question her, tell your attorney.  That will take him back to court.  I'm speaking from experience here, play the game back.  I don't put up with my, soon to be ex. husband's bs, and neither should you.  Don't get mad, get even.  Good luck!|`|9E54gDcLaa	I think you should make a police report and let them know he is stalking you. Get a restraining order on him. I would. unless I still loved him. Then maybe I would try to work things out with him.|`|DabuxRB8aa	You should go file a complain.Don`t forget this is USA and woman has more rights then man.get restraint order agains him.Trust me that works.He will know that you are protected by law.<br>  good luck|`|MxkACob6aa	Get a camera and take pictures of those taking pictures. Do you know them? If so, have pictures, names, dates, times, places, and their connection/relationship to him. That'll start your documentation trail. BTW, you are being stalked and he sounds wacko. be careful; and get compelling proof; and get a restraining order. It will address him and third parties operating on his behalf. On the other hand, if it weren't so annoying, I wouldn't give a flying flip if he knew where I was going. Don't entertain his calls if they do not pertain to your daughter. When it goes beyond that, hang up.
cUO2zYsnaa	You can't really make a girl like you, but you can sort of prompt it to happen. Flirt with her, build some good relationships, watch the body language, be a little sexual. Then when the time is right, when you're both sitting next to eachother in a quiet scenario, tell her you really like her, and you hope she still likes your personality, and ask her if shes willing to give dating a shot. Thanks :)|`|ptPazvB8aa	find out what you did wrong, and then fix it. if you show her your determined to change how she likes, then she fall for you. <br>  also hangout wiht her more. find out her interests, and wat she likes. then use that information to your advantage. The more you are around her, the more she will like you, or maybe it could go the opposite way and you might find something out about her you dont like|`|zrEDyQxGaa	Dude...<br>  It seems like she doesn't like you anymore. Best you can do is try to woo her. Tell her you like her a lot. Don't date anyone else for a while. ACT serious if you ARE serious. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|6Rru2901aa	Be attentive, if you know what type of chocolate she likes, get her one every time you're going to see her *awww* Only with actions will she know that you like her and you're serious about it.<br>  <br>  If you think you wouldn't be abel to keep up, don't even start. There's nothing worse than when you actually like a boy, then you hear he is quite a player, then he plays like he likes you and in one month he''s behind some other chick's ***!<br>  <br>  If your player sense is still in you, leave her alone!<br>  <br>  Moe.|`|JNCpyyYZaa	Start hanging out with her again, and work your magic yet again.|`|B9OwRPSpaa	tell her you like her, alot.<br>  and that you will be very serious with her!|`|MXoUYS6iaa	show her ur serious... be sweet and caring  (but not sappy)...dont be such a boy!! lolxxx|`|AA11712925	Okay, so you do talk with her.  I'm not sure what you mean as 'not being serious' with girls...<br>  First, don't 'chase' girls.  the guys best with "the ladies" are the more laid-back "couldn't care less" guys.<br>  Since you can talk with her, get a chance to sit with her for a few minutes. Don't think of it as "get her to like me", but simply tell her you'd like to ask a question.<br>  "Look, Sarah (whatever her name is) I really like you, but you said I messed it up somehow.  I don't know what I did, and I need to address it for my future relationships.  Can you tell me what it was?"<br>  Something like that. Don't make it feel forced, but use your words and really *ask* her what you did.<br>  Get her to help, be honest and sincere, and then try to hang out with her.  whatever it was - FIX it.  But don't push her or beg.<br>  Once you're hanging out again, and she now knows you like her AND you're trying to be a better person, you can laugh and joke and _pick on her_ and if there's anything there, she'll start to like you naturally.<br>  good luck!|`|uo366Mrqaa	Once girls hear that a boy has a rep, normally it's game over. But if you say to her, to her face, how much you really like her and that it won't be like any other girl, maybe she could give you a chance.. Don't mess it up.|`|FSEjp1uaaa	ask her how you messed it up, this could help because you could explain to her how that happened, maybe it was something she took the wrong way.Then just flirt a lot and smile at her, it always works in the end ;)|`|uj6SE5j7aa	tell her that u really like her. do nice things for her. hang out wit her. take her under the stars and lay down and watch them. hope i helped. hope she likes u again!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  -bella [[burnett]]
BhXwQ2n1aa	yea something is going on in that head of his but there's not much you can do about it right now. if you badger him about it, he'll just close up more. just try...or pretend...to chill out about it and ignore the fact that you're worried and he'll open up.|`|9E54gDcLaa	It means that he is saying he is not something or is not doing something when he really is. That is what denial is. For example, If I got drunk everyday without people knowing and then told everyone I don't drink or have a problem then I am in denial.|`|wXaGIPSPaa	Be patient.  Your anxious to know what the weight is he is carrying around.  Show him some tender loving care today and unconditional love without bringing up your questions. HE will open up to you, he just needs time and to sort his thoughts.  Just be there for him.|`|RUFodZYoaa	What is he referring to when he says this?|`|FEe0He3iaa	denial of what?? what is he denying?|`|PUXmTrnMaa	I think your question is to vague. Are you referring to him saying he is denial about drinking? Generally it's not the person with the problem saying they are in denial..if they know they have problem they are NOT in denial.  If you could clarify and repost it might help.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Perhaps a trip to the doctor would help him and you both.  <br>  <br>  Your question isn't terribly clear to me.  When anyone says they're in "denial," it is a simple recognition of a fact  discovered which they know needs addressing.  Some will choose to remain in denial rather than dealing with the issue.<br>  <br>  Denial is a coping mechanism.  So is drinking to excess.  Unraveling alcoholism involves recognizing denial.
cxA9bQGtaa	make his time with you more interesting. get out of the house or go in the bedroom with him. hes probably worried about work and just wants to forget all about it.|`|FNi40XSaaa	Well doll, there could be a serious problem here. Either mentally or physically.<br>  <br>  It sounds like he's depressed. Have you asked him how he feels about how his life is going now? The economy crisis has hit a lot of people hard, and he might be feeling inadequate. Sleep is a form of escapism, it mimics our time in the womb. So he would rather be in a warm, soft place where he is carefree than get up and actually face the world and it's problems. <br>  <br>  Another explanation is that he has an iron deficiency, or a similar blood disorder. A simple blood test at the doctor's office can determine this. Common blood disorders, such as mediterrainian anemia can cause low iron and hemaglobin and prevent the blood from retaining oxygen which causes the body to feel tired all the time. Other common symptoms include dark circles under the eyes, unrestful sleep (no matter how much sleep he gets he always wakes up tired), dizziness, etc. <br>  <br>  Ways to counteract this sleep feeling is to A) get more exercise. The healthier you are, the more energy you have. B) eat more ruffage (green leafy things, brussel sprouts, romaine lettuce, spinnach), C) more protein in his diet would help as well, eggs, red meat that contains iron. <br>  <br>  I think the first thing you should do is sit down and tell him that you are worried about his health and the health of your relationship. And ask him calmly if he would go to the doctor and get a blood test. Ask him if he feels he's under a lot of stress and pressure. And tell him how his constant sleeping makes you feel. <br>  <br>  Something like: "I feel that your constant sleeping is taking away from time we could be spending as a family" <br>  OR <br>  "Your constant sleeping makes me feel like I am not a priority to you, that you would rather sleep than spend time with me and our child." <br>  <br>  But always end with: "I understand you are under a lot of stress, I was wondering if there is anything I could do to make things easier on you, so that we can spend more quality time together." <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Z9jlS2bUaa	sounds like some sort of depression. You need to not nag him for one. And secondly, do you work? You should help him out with money. Give him some time and space right now.. no pressure, let him deal with the bad economy and things at work. Try to talk to him about it instead of nagging him to spend time with you.|`|abb320882f979cf6d3a395958f9823b0aa	sounds like he is a very bored man try and do something to so there is something to do if i was at home doing nothing i get tired to
