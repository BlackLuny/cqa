And honestly I would rather spend around $600 or below of that. I am well aware that this means whatever car I get is going to be a piece of ****. I know this. ALL I NEED IS A CAR that will last me SIX (6) months, after that I can dump it and I will have enough money for a better car. Until then I need a dirt cheap car will move. It doesnt need to be able to drive on highways, just residential and city streets at anywhere from 0-45 mph. Ok, so thats what I need, now what do I look for? Like under the hood, rust in certain areas? What? Under seats? It doesnt have to look great just drive with relative reliability. Thanks!

20090227141843AA750Cq	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	What is a wheel bearing? Is my mechanic ripping me off?	My mechanic said my car needs a new wheel bearing - What is a wheel bearing, exactly? What is its function and what happens to your car when it wears out?       I took my car to the mechanic a couple of weeks ago to get the axle worked on because of a clicking noise it made when I turned. When I got the car back, the clicking noise was gone, but instead it was making a "whomp, whomp, whomp" noise from the front end, kind of like a fan with extra weight on one blade. When we jacked up the car to investigate the noise, we found a bungee cord still hooked to the spring above the part that had just been replaced. We removed the bungee cord, but the noise continued to get louder. When I took the car back to the mechanic, they said the noise was caused by a worn out wheel bearing and that damage to the wheel bearing couldn't have been caused by the bungee cord or anything they did while working on the axle. Does this sound right?

20090227140454AAL1Vt7	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Got into a minor car accident today. Do I have to report it to insurance?	I got into a minor accident today and hit another car. I was making a right turn when I should have stayed straight, so I collided with the other driver's left rear fender. He and I pulled over, we were both OK, and his car had only a small scratch while mine had a small dent and some scratches.       The other driver was a federal judge, and he told me that since we were both unhurt and were not caught by police, we should just get each other's driver's license and insurance information. He and I agreed that he would call me back to pay him for his repairs.      My question is this: Do I have to report my accident to insurance? I have collision insurance, but I don't want my insurance to go up if I tell the insurance company. If the repairs cost $500 or under, I would really rather pay it out-of-pocket than have to risk it going up.       Besides today, my driving history is clean except for one fender-bender I caused nearly ten years ago.       Bottom line: I'm just not sure what to do. I don't want to tell my parents about this because I'd rather just take care of it myself, but I don't want to get in deep trouble because I didn't report it (even though the police did not see the accident). Please help me figure out my best course of action.

The problem is the amp for the kicker shuts off at level 22 of 34 on the head unit, and the head unit itself shuts off at 27 then turns back on but the volume needs to be lowered to work again.  Also, my small amp blew a fuse.  I thought it was a simple ground issue so i ran an 8ga wire from the battery to a distribution strip and then ran 2 8ga grounds to the amps.  I also ran the head unit ground to the strip.  It still doesnt work.   Any ideas?
20070722145152AAvdS32	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Cost to paint a 1969 Ford 250 Ranger?	I'm thinking about buying a 1969 Ford 250 Ranger.  It's in pretty good shape, with just a little bit of rust on some of the seams and one spot of rust that might require a bit of bondo repair.  I don't think there are any dents on the body otherwise.  There's no rust whatsoever on the bed.  The engine's already been restored -- she runs great -- and all that's left is the cosmetics.  I'll eventually want to fix up the interior but first things first.  I don't want the rust to advance so the first thing to do is the paint job.  I want a decent paint job (not a crummy Maaco job, which is what lots of people here advise against) so where should I go and what would it cost me?  If it makes a difference, the truck will be painted in the Denver CO area.

20090307105334AAbSP3U	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Dodge	What can I do to fix my Dodge Grand Caravan's manual sliding door problem?	Hi, I currently have a 1994 Dodge Grand Caravan that my parents handed down to me, I'm currently trying to fix it up since it is a rare AWD model. Aside from a few mechanical problems, my main concern is the sliding door.      The sliding door opens fairly easily. When you go to close it, you need to literally slam it shut with all of your might, otherwise it won't latch properly. I was wondering what I could do to free up the sliding door and make closing it much easier, because I plan to use the van as a friend hauler. Yes, I'm a teenager in high school. I have a bunch of good friends that I enjoy hanging out with and I can fit a few more friends into the van than my 5-seat car.      I heard about applying lubricants to the rollers and the tracks. If this is the best route, what type of lubricant should I use and where/how should I apply it?

I can see a need for exceeding the limit by 15-20% in some extreme conditions but I don't see why a Bugatti is allowed on roads.
