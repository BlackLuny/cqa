20080704235928AALAMyQ	Pets;Fish	WHY are my trout jumping out of the pond? Trouticide?  Whats the deal?	My pond is fed by a large lake.  My pond has a creek running out of it back into the lake...      Instead of swimming down the creek and back into the lake, my trout are jumping out and landing on the grass in my yard.  This pond is 20 years old and I have never seen any behavior like this before.   Last week 9 trout all jumped out and landed in a spot in the middle of a 1 acre yard of grass in the size of a coffee can lid...to which I astutely said WTF??      Any ideas on why trout jump onto land like this?  Never seen it before.  Thanks in advance if you have the answer.
20080811103451AAhiPAz	Pets;Dogs	QUEM conhece a história de SEXO?	Cachorros têm diversos nomes, mas Eu....   Eu botei o nome do meu de "Sexo".   Mas agora, Sexo é muito embara?oso para mim...Quando eu fui à prefeitura renovar a licen?a dele,disse ao funcionário que queria uma licen?a para Sexo,e ele disse que também queria uma para ele!   Aí eu disse que era para um cachorro,e ele disse que n?o se importava com o tipo de vida dos outros.   Eu disse: - "Você n?o entende? Eu tenho Sexo desde os 9 anos de idade." E ele replicou: - "Você devia ser um garoto bem precoce!"   Quando resolvi casar, disse ao padre que gostaria de    ter Sexo na igreja durante a cerimonia de casamento.   Ele falou que eu teria que esperar a cerimonia acabar.   Eu disse: -    "Mas Sexo tem uma grande importancia na minha vida.    Meu mundo gira em torno de Sexo.   " Ele disse que n?o gostaria de ficar ouvindo sobre a    minha vida pessoal, e que n?o nos casaria na igreja dele.   Aí eu contei a ele que todos os familiares e convidados    gostariam de ter Sexo na igreja.    No dia seguinte casei apenas no civil. Minha família foi banida da igreja para sempre.   Quando fomos para a lua de mel,    levamos Sexo conosco.   Ao chegar no hotel, eu pedi um quarto para minha mulher e eu.   E um quarto especial para Sexo.   O atendente disse que todos os quartos    eram bons para sexo.   E eu: - "Você n?o entende?    Sexo me mantém acordado a noite toda!    E ele: - "Eu também!"   Um dia inscrevi Sexo numa competi??o,    mas ele sumiu.   Um outro competidor perguntou o que eu    estava procurando, e eu disse que gostaria de ter Sexo na competi??o.Ele disse que eu estava na competi??o errada.    Por favor, implorei, “Eu quero ter Sexo na TV”! Ele chamou os seguran?a, que me puseram para fora.   Quando me divorciei, fomos ao fórum,    brigar pela custódia do c?o.Eu disse: - Meritíssimo,eu tinha Sexo antes    do casamento, mas ele me abandonou depois que casei.   O Juiz lamentou: - "Comigo ocorreu o mesmo..."   Ontem à noite Sexo fugiu de novo.    Procurei durante horas, até que um policial    perguntou o que eu estava fazendo na rua    às 4:00 da manh?.   Eu disse que estava procurando por Sexo.   Meu caso vai a julgamento semana que vem...    Bem, agora eu estou na cadeia, divorciado, com mais problemas com o cachorro do que eu poderia imaginar.    Quando fui à primeira sess?o com o psiquiatra, ele perguntou qual era o meu problema.   E eu disse: - Sexo sempre foi meu melhor amigo, porto da minha vida.   Mas, agora ele me abandonou, e sem Sexo eu estou t?o sozinho que n?o tenho mais raz?o para viver.   E o doutor: - Sexo n?o pode ser o melhor amigo de um homem.   Por que você n?o compra um cachorro?      LUZ!   rsrsrs

20081021160719AAmVsM2	Pets;Fish	Do you have a Betta Fish?	I am thinking of getting another one..it's been a few years .      But wanted to share these tips to anyone who has one or thinking about getting one:      The 2nd half of #2.. about the water..that's sooo important. So many fish have died because people use reg. tap water.         Betta fish, also called Siamese fighting fish are one of the most popular types of fish found in homes across the world. Their vibrant color and active lifestyle seems to draw in fish fanatics as well as those who have never had fish before. Betta’s are relatively easy to care for and their low maintenance is particularly appealing to people who would like to have fish but don’t have a lot of time to care for them.      Once you bring your Betta’s home you should begin to familiarize yourself with their movements and typical behavior patterns. When you look at your fish after you’ve had them for awhile you’ll know if something is wrong, if they are not feeling well, or if the water in their bowl is not in the best condition simply by being observant.      1. Make sure the jar or bowl that you keep your Betta in is big enough so that he can swim around and not bump or tear his fins or scales. Also be sure there is plenty of surface area so that he can get enough oxygen.      2. Your Betta will thrive in the cleanest water that you can provide for him. He does not require a filtration system, but you should change out a third of his water every three days so it stays fresh and clean and keeps your finned friend from getting bacterial or fungal infections. Aged water (water that has set out for twenty four hours) is what should be used to replace the old water.      3. Do not put your Betta fish with other Betta’s. They are called Siamese fighting fish because they are, in fact, fighting fish. They will tear at one another, often causing the death of at least one fish before they stop. Betta’s can be coupled with algae eaters, guppies, or corydorus catfish safely.      4. Use a turkey baster to clean small particles of uneaten food or debris from the bottom of the bowl or jar. Allowing this debris to sit at the bottom of the jar will cause the water to become cloudy, unsanitary, and to smell awful.      5. The PH of your tank should be at exactly 7.0. You can get a PH testing kit at your pet store along with solutions to minimize or increase the PH of your water.      6. When you clean the plants, rocks, or decorations in the bowl you should never use soap on them. It’s very hard to completely rinse all soap from these items and the soap residue can harm or even kill your Betta. Instead, use warm water and an abrasive brush to clean his things.      7. Keep your Betta tank, jar, or bowl covered! Your Beta will jump and you don’t want him to end up flopping on the tabletop! Keeping the water level at least two inches from the top of the tank should also cut down on this problem.      8. Your Betta is a meat eater and likes live foods, such as brine shrimp the best. Frozen bloodworms are also a good choice for your meat eater. Most Betta fish will happily eat the Betta pellets sold at most pet stores. For a special treat every now and again you should offer some live food! You’ll have fun watching him eat it up!      9. Do not decorate your Betta bowl with rocks or marbles that may cause your Betta to get stuck between or under them. Be sure that they are a flat smooth surface that provides no risk to the health of your fish.      10. Remember that your fish is a living, breathing responsibility. You need to feed, clean, and care for your Betta just like you would any other pet. If he’s sick take him to the vet, if he’s hungry feed him, if his home is dirty, clean it.

I was going to put them all in the tank, but then decided that Koi can survive this weather. So now that I look at my goldfish he looks like he is missing scales. My outdoor Koi also looks like he is missing some scales. They both had gone in a net and put in the tank but the Koi were taken out. So is it the net that scratched their scales off, or what? It just looks like missing scales on one side and no where else. What is it? And if it is not good how can i fix it?

My westie had puppies in July and we sold her puppies. 4 days ago we bought back one of them a little girl because she wasn't wanted anymore. She's now 3 1/2 months old and since returning to us we noticed she has bad food aggression. She growls and bites you if you touch her bowl while shes eating, if the cats or her mother get near her food and also if she vomits and trys to eat it. When I go to pick her up(so she wont eat it) she flips out abd bites me. She is a sweet girl and isn't aggressive with anything besides food. How can I help her get over this aggression so she don't act like this as an adult?

20090222222745AAzdI0g	Pets;Fish	My husband brought a beta fish home that he found abandoned at work. I'm a fish killer for some reason...?	so I need some help. This little guys family moved out on him and he has been living one of the larger beta tanks (approx 6" x 4" x 2 1/2") with about 2 inches of water in it and very dirty. I ALWAYS managed to kill my kids fish when they were little whenever I changed the water. I would get some of the water out with the fish and put it in another container, clean the regular tank, fill it back up, put the right amount of water conditioner in it and then I would let it bubble (if it had air) for 48 hours even though I shouldn't have to wait that long. After killing so many fish I figured I would do that to give the fish an extra fighting chance. Couldn't hurt right? :) So after the 48 hours, I would pour the fish and his water into a sandwich baggy and let it float for an hour or so before dumping it into the new water. Needless to say, I haven't had a survivor yet! I have 3 questions:   1. What am I doing wrong? 2. When putting them into the new water, how long should I let them float to make sure the temp is right? and  3. Can beta fish live in an aquarium that has air pump making the bubbles in the water? (Because I know that they make their own bubbles to breathe, wasn't sure if there is such a thing as too much air in the water) :)
20090222223738AALUwdd	Pets;Dogs	Are these signs that my dog was previously abused?	I have a  4.5 lbs. 5 year old Yorkie that I adopted from a breeder 2 years ago.  I thought by now some of her unbalanced behavior would have gone away.  She is timid, she doesn't like anyone but me, she is afraid of the sound of her nails on the floor, she sometimes walk with her belly nearly touching the floor and she shakes often.  She hesitantly comes when I call her unless we are outside, then she comes immediately the first time I call her.  My husband has not been able to hold her since she came to our home.  She just doesn't want him to touch her.  There are no children in my home to contribute to her condition.  What have I done incorrectly or are these signs of previous abuse?  I feel as though I am failing as a pack leader for my dog.

Mi gato tiene 14 a?os, está muy gordito, es muy sentido, siempre maulla sin que le pase nada, y no deja de hacerlo a la hora en que estamos durmiendo, grita como si estuviese en celo, pero está castrado, y rasca las puertas que encuentra cerradas para entrar, además me coge las toallas y duerme sobre ellas. Todo esto antes no lo hacía.

El tema es que ya teniamos dos gatas, una de 7 a?os   y otra de 3 a?os.    El tema es que las dos gatas están super enojadas y no salen de mi   cuarto, para ser mas especifico de abajo de mi cama. Intenté   ponerlos en la misma habitacion ( a las gatas y al perro) como para   que se huelan y se conozcan. Intento ponerlos cerca pero no demasiado   asi se reconocen de a poco.    El perro ni mosquea con las gatas pero ellas están como ofendidas.   ?Qué hago? ?Alguno tuvo una experiencia parecida?

20070606123608AA2UuVh	Pets;Dogs	Hot spots? Bites? help!?	I have a Husky/Lab and I noticed yesterday that she had some bumps on her skin. I figured that she just got tangled up with a bunch of ant or something of that nature. This morning those bumps turned into little bloody sores. She wants to lick them, but other than that she doesn't seem that bothered. I shaved the fur from around all of the spots to see them better.      There are about 10 on her (or at least the ones I found) and they are all over her. On her back, under her tail, on her legs, on her belly...just everywhere. She hasn't had anything new as far as food or treats, and she has never had any known allergies in the past, perfectly healthy 1 1/2 year old dog. Any ideas will help, thank you!

20090223010846AAWB9Z1	Pets;Dogs	Why so many more cats than dogs in shelters and euthanized?	And it's more difficult for shelters to adopt out cats than dogs. Why?      My three local shelters, SPCA, Humane Society, city pound all tell me the same that cats go less and slower than dogs and that big dogs go slower than small dogs.      Is it just that cats are considered disposable and that's why there are so many more?

This is in spanish      And you will find this very disturbing       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90J7h-_-R...       This is the time where i wish a dog would turn on its owner. I wish this dog would give this man a taste of his own medicine. This just shows how loyal this breed is, and even through such a beating, it will still coward down to the one that it looks up to. This man has no idea what a powerful breed of dog he just messed with, and in a split second this dog could have ripped him a new one.

Am I the only one that finds this very very sad, I cry every time I read it, I hope this encourages people to adopt from shelters:) Is there anyone that actually doesnt care about this story? anyone that couldnt give a **** if the dog dies or not?   xx            By Jim Willis, 2001   How Could You?         When I was a puppy, I entertained you with my antics and made you laugh. You called me your child, and despite a number of chewed shoes and a couple of murdered throw pillows, I became your best friend. ...      Whenever I was "bad," you'd shake your finger at me and ask "How could you?" -- but then you'd relent and roll me over for a belly rub.      My housebreaking took a little longer than expected, because you were terribly busy, but we worked on that together. I remember those nights of nuzzling you in bed and listening to your confidences and secret dreams, and I believed that life could not be any more perfect.      We went for long walks and runs in the park, car rides, stops for ice cream (I only got the cone because "ice cream is bad for dogs" you said), and I took long naps in the sun waiting for you to come home at the end of the day.      Gradually, you began spending more time at work and on your career, and more time searching for a human mate. I waited for you patiently, comforted you through heartbreaks and disappointments, never chided you about bad decisions, and romped with glee at your homecomings, and when you fell in love.      She, now your wife, is not a "dog person" -- still I welcomed her into our home, tried to show her affection, and obeyed her. I was happy because you were happy.      Then the human babies came along and I shared your excitement. I was fascinated by their pinkness, how they smelled, and I wanted to mother them, too. Only she and you worried that I might hurt them, and I spent most of my time banished to another room, or to a dog crate. Oh, how I wanted to love them, but I became a prisoner of love."      As they began to grow, I became their friend. They clung to my fur and pulled themselves up on wobbly legs, poked fingers in my eyes, investigated my ears, and gave me kisses on my nose. I loved everything about them and their touch -- because your touch was now so infrequent -- and I would've defended them with my life if need be. I would sneak into their beds and listen to their worries and secret dreams, and together we waited for the sound of your car in the driveway.      There had been a time, when others asked you if you had a dog, that you produced a photo of me from your wallet and told them stories about me. These past few years, you just answered "yes" and changed the subject. I had gone from being "your dog" to "just a dog," and you resented every expenditure on my behalf.      Now, you have a new career opportunity in another city, and you and they will be moving to an apartment that does not allow pets. You've made the right decision for your "family," but there was a time when I was your only family.      I was excited about the car ride until we arrived at the animal shelter. It smelled of dogs and cats, of fear, of hopelessness. You filled out the paperwork and said "I know you will find a good home for her." They shrugged and gave you a pained look. They understand the realities facing a middle-aged dog, even one with "papers."      You had to pry your son's fingers loose from my collar as he screamed, "No, Daddy! Please don't let them take my dog!" And I worried for him, and what lessons you had just taught him about friendship and loyalty, about love and responsibility, and about respect for all life.      You gave me a good-bye pat on the head, avoided my eyes, and politely refused to take my collar and leash with you. You had a deadline to meet and now I have one, too. After you left, the two nice ladies said you probably knew about your upcoming move months ago and made no attempt to find me another good home. They shook their heads and asked "How could you?"      They are as attentive to us here in the shelter as their busy schedules allow. They feed us, of course, but I lost my appetite days ago.      At first, whenever anyone passed my pen, I rushed to the front, hoping it was you that you had changed your mind -- that this was all a bad dream... or I hoped it would at least be someone who cared, anyone who might save me.      When I realized I could not compete with the frolicking for attention of happy puppies, oblivious to their own fate, I retreated to a far corner and waited. I heard her footsteps as she came for me at the end of the day, and I padded along the aisle after her to a separate room. A blissfully quiet room.      She placed me on the table and rubbed my ears, and told me not to worry. My heart pounded in anticipation of what was to come, but there was also a sense of relief. The prisoner of love had run out of days.      As is my nature, I was more concerned about her. The burden which she bears weighs heavily on her, and I know that, the same way I knew

20090223005636AAYAslE	Pets;Cats	What happened to this cat?	I have a close friend I was in her car with, we go on a route and feed homeless cats regularly.  When we pull in to some spots, the cats know the car and run out, walking along the car as we park. This is the norm, so we always go very, very slow, like a crawl, one of the cats wasn't paying attention, and although we were moving very slowly, he got his paw ran over.   We stopped immediately, and the cat ran off, holding it's hind leg up.   This was 3 nights ago. It's all I can think about. We have looked, and looked, and can't find him anywhere.   We want to get him to a vet, he obviously needs his foot repaired, or worse, amputated, we are just worried sick.   I would like advise from a vet or tech on what's possibly happening.    I'm sure he's hiding, but will he come out? Did he go into shock and die?   Please tell me something.  Before the paw under the tire, he's fixed, and very healthy. Approx. 3 yrs. old.   Thanks so much, we're desperate to know something.
20090223002509AARtYF9	Pets;Other - Pets	Dogs are great but bad owners make them a Misery for neighbours.?	Dogs are great but bad owners make them a Misery for neighbours.   I love most animals I do not like small dogs at all. Big dogs are great.   But in today’s society and I am talking about the UK, we have very bad dog owners they never take their dog for a walk the poor thing is often on a piece of rope tied to a pole and left to bark its head of and disturb others. Is this right I think not how do you feel about dog owners or in fact any pet owner who fails to look after their animals correctly. I believe if you have not the time to give your pets do not have them they are a living creature and deserve to be treated right. If they were humans the courts of Human rights would be down on these owners for torture and giving them a poor quality of life.    I would like to see proactive dog (pet) wardens that track down these bad owners and take the animals away and prosecute the so called owners?

20090223003143AAMqIjS	Pets;Other - Pets	Question about ferrets and intestinal worms?	I have 4 ferrets, 2 male adults (Gizmo and Peanut) and 2 female babies that we've only had for about a week (Dita and Bonnie). They all live in a really large cage together and spend a few hours a day in a play pen together. Earlier in the evening while I was cleaning the ferret cage, I noticed what looked like tiny (about the size of a grain of rice) worms in one particular area of the cage.      So, I separated all 4 ferrets (they're still seperated) until each one of them pooped and I looked through each turd (for lack of a better word) and all except Dita's looked normal. I'm still not totally sure if I saw worms in her poop, but I looked at her butt and saw what looked like a really small whitehead on the side of her butt hole (sorry if TMI). The weird thing is, the little white spot was attached to her.       Gizmo and Peanut haven't lost any weight (and they're HUGE) since bringing home the babies, but it might be too early to tell by that. All 4 of my ferrets are really active and alert and no one seems to be in any distress or discomfort, and there is also no diarrhea.       Now that I've told you everything I can think of, my questions are...      - Should I take Dita or all 4 to the vet?   - Is there something I can buy at Petco that will help?   - Should I keep all of them them seperated, or just Dita?   - And (not that it matters to me) is there a rough estimate of what it'll cost to buy the medicine.          I love my ferrets and I'll spend any amount of money to keep them healthy. It would break my 2 year old daughter's and my own heart if something happend to any of them, so all advice is welcome and appreciated.       If you have any questions or need any more details or I forgot to add something, just ask, I'll be checking back every few minutes.       Thanks everyone!

20090223005909AAO9bmX	Pets;Dogs	What should I do about my neighbor's dog... ?	They never use a leash or even watch the poor thing when they let it outside. We live off a busy road too. It comes over to my yard and does it's business. I have two dogs who I always keep on a leash when we are outside. I'm afraid that with this dog unsupervised that a fight could break out. My male dog really doesn't like new dogs in his yard. Also the neighbor's dog looks as though it has mange. It has no hair on it's back or tail and has bloody sores on it's skin.    I'm not sure whether I should call animal control just to be sure the dog is being taken care of properly or not. Or to call just to complain of the dog not being on leash. I'd really prefer to talk to the neighbors about it, but if I talk to them about it and they do nothing I would need to call animal control. They would know I was the one making the complaint and maybe get mad at me. I don't want a fight between my neighbor's and I. Any advice?

20080709194315AAKHWtD	Pets;Dogs	What do you dog lovers think?	I am a dog trainer and lover...    More and more, dog parks are becoming very popular and widespread. It is a great way to socialize and exercise both dog and owner. BUT the amount of disputes that are in the parks about the dogs and their behaviors is turning people off of the parks because they are frustrating, especially when owners do not have a handle over dogs. So this was my idea, and I want to know if it's a good one or not....It's called a FLAG system, basically there are 3 color flags, red, yellow and green.  There would be a box filled with handkerchiefs of these three colors. If you have a very well mannered and easy going dog, you tie a green one to his collar. If your dog is so-so you put a yellow one, and if you have a sensitive or reactive dog you put a red one. Before walking into the dog park, you can scout to see if there are any reds to avoid conflict. If you see a red, you can courteously ask the owner if it is ok to enter? Can this help stressed out owners/dogs?

20081108085556AArG1Qo	Pets;Dogs	Please Help Dog Advice? (:?	well in early october i got my first dog. she was a boxer/aussie which are high energy dogs, i know. and my parents just now split which put even more pressure on me and my mom. plus i have a three year old brother, so once again we are a single family. i named my dog kona.       i have school from 8:15 and i get home at 3. sometimes she would poop in her cage, or pee. (she's four months) i'd immediately take her out, and as soon as she finished bring her inside. at school i took off from my lunch period to do my homework, so i had less when i got home, so i could spend/take care of my pup. well two days ago my mom took her away back to the pound. i am so upset. i tried to spend as much time with her as i could, and i know most of you will say you weren't ready for a dog. my mom took her back because of her biting, even though it started to get better as i trained her. she scratched up my brother, but i made sure to put her in her crate, and tell her NO when she hurt him.       and he's little, and since he didnt know any better he'd pull on her tail, or her ears, BUT NOT HARD. so i made sure to keep an eye on them.      if anyone has something mean to say, dont post.      but my mom said once things settle down with her and my stepdad, and my brother we might get another puppy, or kitten. but i'd rather have a dog even though they are more active, and kittens just kind of lounge.      my question is:      what dog should i get.      im fourteen, in eigth grade. i have lacrosse practice on wednesdays and thursday at 5:30, and then game on saturdays but they have a dog park there. i also do my homework for about an hour or hour and a half.      ^^ that was completely pointless, but please help.

20090222220426AAQDOoE	Pets;Cats	My cat is terrified of me!?	About a month ago, my cat started hiding under the couch and won't come out.  There may be more than one reason:      #1:  About the time this antisocial behavior started, he started limping.  I took him to the vet, and it appears the head of his femur is fractured.  The vet recommended rest for three weeks so that we can determine whether a surgery is needed.  However, I had to cancel the follow-up appointment, which was scheduled for last week, because I can't afford it.  (I have rescheduled the appointment for a date after I receive my next paycheck)  My cat has been hiding under the couch for about a month now, and will only come out to get food, water, and go to the litterbox.  If I happen to be around when he emerges, he turns around and darts right back under the couch.      #2:  I've scolded my cat harshly every now and then, but it never seemed to faze him until he got hurt.  He used to be very rebellious, and I had to hit him and hold him down to the ground so that he would learn his lesson.  He always got over it within a few minutes.  I only scolded him once after his injury, and it was because he stubbornly sat in a place in my apartment that he is not allowed, even after I removed him.  When I tried removing him again, he tried biting me, which is when I grabbed his face and hit him.  After this incident, he has not come out from under the couch.  He shakes whenever I come near and when I try to pet him, he squints his eyes, flattens his ears and bows his head.  This breaks my heart.      What can I do to regain his trust?

And her hind area was real swollen and bloody, so I gave her a bath. When I was bathing her, she was leaking blood a bit (but it stopped).      Now im holding her and she isn't her self. She is exhausted and can hardly move. She is also boofed and really cold.      Should I take the two babies out and put them back with their real mom?       And should I take her to the vet?      And what can I do to make her feel better?

Me and my Grandma have just bought a female 7 month old stafforshire bull terrier from a young mother who couldn't handle both a baby and a dog.. (understandably!) when we first brought her home she went outside to do the toilet like she's supposed to but now she will poo out there but not wee. I tell her it's time for "wee wees" and she just looks at me and wont go out so I end up having to lift her up and put her out and i stand in the garden with her hoping she will have a wee. I usually stay out with her for about 10-20 minutes but I can tell she hates it and she will never go. And then as soon as I let her back in she will sneak off an wee on the carpet! I really dond know what's wrong with her as I've never had this problem with any other dog. I've also tried leaving her outside on her own & walking her after tea and before bed but she will never do anything! I've told her "naughty" when she does it in the house and have put her straight out after but she just won't learn. PLEASE HELP...
