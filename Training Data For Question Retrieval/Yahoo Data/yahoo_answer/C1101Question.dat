I recently bought a lotion for my face called "Facial Attraction'. I have used it a couple of times and I have seen a difference. I'm just wondering, there are some days I am not able to make it to the tanning bed and I'm wondering if the lotion works at all on it's own, without going to the salon. (Don't be mistaken.. it's not a self-tanner.. it's double bronzer, facial tanning formula) I'm just wondering if these products you purchase at the salon can be used on their own(and work) for those days in between sessions.

20090205090059AAlBL3i	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	The size zero trend in the US, is it real?	I live in Europe, specifically Portugal. I normally wear a 38/40 (Euro sizes, obv) for trousers because I have 38" hips, and a 38 for shirts because of the 37" bust. I'm 5'4". This is considered a more or less normal size for my age. I don't consider myself fat or thin, and in fact I can't imagine how anyone can be thinner than me, so a size 0 to me sounds out of this world.   I hear a lot of talk about the size zero/two/four trend in the US. I don't understand! One would think that a size 8 would be 38" around the hip, thus making a size 30", which is practically impossible unless you're 10 years old.    Is this just vanity sizing? How big is a size 0, is it a lot bigger than I think it is?  Or are women actually starving themselves to fit into pre-pubescent jeans?

20061228134308AAMb48E	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Where can I go, in-person or on-line, to get a custom-made-to-fit bra?	As most women know, breasts are never 'exactly' the same size.  The cup size difference for me is nearly a full cup size with both being 'in-between' sizes. (EX. one is a B-and-a-half and the other is a C-and-a-half.)  If the cup fits the smaller one, the larger one is tumbling out.  If it fits the larger one, the smaller one gets no support.  I have casually looked around but haven't found anything that might help me.  So I thought have my bras special made, just for me, is the way to go.  However, how do I go about that?

I've been using clean and clear and the acne's cleared up a bit but it won't actually go away, and thank god it doesnt dry out my skin (don't use proactiv i repeat don't....your face will PEEL it's gross).       About the dry skin, it's always around my nose and cheekbones and I have no idea why. I've been using moisturizer (that's made for the face and stuff) and it helps temporarily but then by the end of the dry it's dry again. What do you recomend? I need something that really works, have any ideas for a tinted moisturizer? I have light olive skin... also please only tell me if it's affordable xD I saw one that was like $30. Just a good tinted moisturizer that's all I need.      Any other ideas on how I can make my skin look good? So far I just need a good moisturizer and maybe a slightly stronger acne medication (clean and clear really did make my acne less noticeable (it was never actually bad in the first place just got on my nerves) but it never made it completely go away).      I don't wear a lot of make-up, I guess I'm naturally pretty (not bragging). Just some eyeliner, mascara, lipgloss and maybe a little blush..... so, any tips to help me with my skin? xD

So, I had my original naval peircing for a couple of months, then bought a naval ring at a craft show.  I soaked it in rubbing alcohol for a day then put it in, but ever since I got it, the skin in front of the belly button ring has been getting smaller..not like loose skin, but its like the skin behind the peircing is closing and pushing it out. I had little skin left on the front, so I just took it out.  I have been smothering it in neosporin, bc the skin is kind of hard. It doesn't look like there's any type of infection though.  How long will it take before the hole completely closes up?

20090205104122AA6GgSt	Beauty & Style;Hair	Hair loss question.....?	When I lose hair sometimes it is because my scalp itches, I feel a crusted small bump and the hair comes out. When I grab the hair with this "bump" I notice there is a yellow waxy puss on the end. It is like the hard pus that comes out from a pimple or something. When you remove this wax you see the bulbous structure of the white root. What initially comes out it not the root bc the root is under this yellow stuff. So my question is, is this excess sebum? And please do not answer with "it is your root" I am trying to make it clear that this is COVERING the root and once this YELLOW waxy stuff is removed the WHITE BULB root is underneath and attached to the hair. When you look at the hair when it is still on my scalp you can see this same yellow stuff surrounding the hair follicle. It is like when the hair falls out or is pulled out this waxy stuff on my scalp attaches to it. Thank for any help.

Im currently studying hairdressing so I sort of know what to put on my hair and what not to put on, but I would still like some advice.      I want to go a red/brown colour, but Im too scared to colour my blonde incase it comes out mega red.  I want it more brown.   My friend has this colour on her hair:    http://www.chemistdirect.co.uk/recital-p...        She put this colour on top of bleached hair and it looks lovely.  She said it comes out quite red at first but fades, but to me her hair is more brown than the red shown on the box.   Does any reccomend any good colours to use? Im from the uk, so can shop in boots, superdrug etc. If you could give me a link to a suitable hair colour that would take on bleached hair I would be very gratefull.      My other friend has used this colour;    http://www.superdrug.com/invt/113646       but she has put this on her dyed brown hair so it wont look the same on my hair.    It never came out black, it was more red.   If I used this on my hair would it go really red, or really back? as blonde hair is pourous and grabs colour?   I really need some help.   Thank you.   Rachael.

20090219113825AAkjcsY	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	What is it about a skirt and heel that makes boys go crazy?	I admit, I am sort of a nerd and am usually very quiet in class. I wear nice, form-fitting clothes but only wear plain uniform and don't spend the extra time trying to dress my uniform up (by adding vests and extra polos or a tank top under the polo, etc). For the most part, since I am quiet and shy I don't get paid that much attention to.      But yesterday, I went on a field trip and we had to wear buisness attire so I wore a nice dress shirt with heels, a skirt, and a headband. When we got back to school, I noticed that I started getting all of this attention I don't usually get. /boys in the hallway stopped to talk and flirt with me, my male math teacher made a comment about how I looked nice today and how I should talk to our prinicipal while "I'm all dressed up and pretty today" to persuade him to give us an AP Calculus BC class, and then people who never talked to me (mainly boys) were all of a sudden interested in my life and asking me tons of questions about myself.      So what is it about a skirt and heels that makes people go "ooo pretty." I did nothing different with my face and my hair was the same way it always is. So why did I get more attention when I was dressed up then when I am just in plain regular uniform?

A few days ago i dyed my hair with a dye that is supposed to wash out in 28 washes.It was the first time i have ever dyed and I think i ahve pretty healthy hair. I have lighter brownish-blonde hair so it will probably take longer than 28 washes. I was aiming for a darker brown color and ended up with a really really dark red color and i dont like it at all. Normally I would just wait for it to wash out but who knows how long that will take and i am leaving in less than two weeks for the bahamas and i would rather not have red hair for my trip. I have read about using dishwashing liquid, as well as laudry degergent? do any of those things work? what is the best way for me to get my hair back to its normal color without dying it?

20090219122042AAwYJiO	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	I have horrible dry lips. Why?	I'm portuguese, so I go to Portugal almost every year since I've been born. Last Dec-Jen I went to Portugal and if I stay there for too long; my face begins to get bumpy which also lead to my lips being extremely dry since the weather climate is different then here.       Since then I've been needing to put chapstick every half hour. I go through chapsticks like crazy. I usually use Blistex because I get a good result out of using it but I still managed to get dry lips. I don't lick my lips so much now.       And just recently, a little around my mouth, feels a little chapped - bumpy is more like it. What is it?      I want to know what's wrong with my lips. Does anybody have any ideas or suggestions to help.
