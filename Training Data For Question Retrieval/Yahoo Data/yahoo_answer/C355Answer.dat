41ccaf0cf96865f8f9c8fc048929c8b5aa	I enjoy John Mayer but Jack Johnson is really good also, and they are both great in concert.

Maybe they need to find a nobody (per say) instead of trying to fill vacancies w/ celebrities on high horses.    Star lost the weight w/ gastric bypass surgery, tho she hates to admit it- leading people to think that she successfully and very quickly lost over 100 lbs. just by dieting and excersizing.  That was one of Rosie O'Donnell dislikes about Star- that her dishonesty about weight loss was very misleading and disheartening to people.  And I agree-- not that it is any of our business, but when you make such a HUGE ordeal about something... Then share your secrets or shut-up.|`|AA12066978	i think that show needs some order  everyone talks at the same time and you can't understand a word they are saying.  i think she looks sick now that she's skinny  i liked her better "fat"|`|29ca3bef0167d8a61b95a6dc9ac16744aa	Sheryl Lee Ralph..

New faces are coming in. There is no dearth of talented ladies.Anyone who has some legal background will fill the bill.    All women, particularly here in U.S., feel inside they are fat women. So they start starving (dieting) In the case of Star Jones, her marriage has brought about a great change (for better or worse) in her shape and her face has grown pale & eyes showing signs of voluntary starvation.    Can't guess what her compulsions are to diet.
c4037de83bbbb7abe909d9917332d907aa	I agree that Buffy The Vampire Slayer is the best show to ever come out of the WB.  A lot of people make a snap judgement about the show just based on the title but it really is an awesome series.  I own the whole thing on DVD.

d13fcba4adf1d04f6adf5a7b255e9910aa	Season 6   88 The Ick Factor    The relationship between Carrie and Petrovsky continues to develop, but one thing continues to nag at Carrie. Petrovsky is given to grand gestures of affection (including poetry reading and the composition of original love songs), and that's a bit too much for this slightly cynical New York girl. When Petrovsky takes Carrie to a premiere at the Met, she literally swoons. To balance things out, the artist takes her to McDonald's, where the pair become the most elegantly dressed duo in the establishment's history.     Steve and Miranda decide to finally tie the knot, but vow not to have an elaborate wedding. Keeping things low-key isn't as easy as it sounds, but they eventually manage to work things out, finding a perfect community garden in which to hold their ceremony.     Not to be left behind in the romance department, Harry takes Charlotte to an upscale French restauarant. The meal is wonderful, but later that night, the newlyweds both come down with acute food poisoning. The romantic evening breaks down, as the pair alternates dashes to the restroom. The experience may not be the most intimate, but it does make clear their genuine love and caring for each other.     After seeing herself pictured in In Touch magazine, Samantha decides to get breast augmentation. However, during her initial consultation with a plastic surgeon, a lump is found in her breast. The biopsy reveals that the growth is cancerous, and Samantha realizes that she's in for the fight of her life.     The day of Steve and Miranda's wedding arrives, but before they get to the ceremony, Samantha discloses her condition to Carrie. Samantha is very matter-of-fact, and swears Carrie to temporary secrecy, as not to ruin Miranda's big day. The ceremony is beautiful, but during the reception, both Charlotte and Miranda discover Samantha's secret. The four friends then spend some sobering time preparing for what will no doubt be a long journey for all of them.|`|007e84bb2bb692ef8d1dfdb0ab316defaa	but the dvd that has all the seasons & check it out yoself.|`|AA10332096	It's in Season 6.

AA10356211	Here are the episode summaries from the episode you mentioned, Sookie's wedding to the most recent episode in season 6. You can watch the most recent season on The WB at 8 Eastern on Tuesdays, but in September, The WB at UPN are merging to become The CW. Season 7 premieres on September 19th, 2006, along with seaosn 6 coming out on DVD.   Summaries: Sookie's wedding draws near, while Lorelai finally relents and goes into the diner, where she apologizes profusely to Luke.Christopher comes to town for the removal of Rory's cast and decides to stay for Sookie's wedding. While Lorelai and Chris seem to be getting along, Sherry drops a bomb. Paris is running for student body president, and employs Rory as vice-president. Jess returns to Stars Hollow and asks Luke if he can stay. Amidst her sadness about Christopher, Lorelai has an intriguing dream about Luke; Rory returns from Washington to realize that she still may have feelings for Jess, but a chance encounter at the First Annual Stars Hollow End of Summer Madness Festival makes her realize that he may have moved on to someone else; relationship quarrels abound -- Sookie and Jackson over decorating their house, Lorelai and Rory over Jess versus Dean, Emily and Richard over Lorelai and Christopher -- but are on the path to resolution; and Rory once again guides Paris through the rocky shoals of preparing for a date. To Lorelai's horror, Kirk asks her out on a date after being encouraged by Luke; Emily's lunch with Lorelai at Luke's ends badly; Christopher shows up uninvited at Friday night dinner and quarrels with both Lorelai and Rory before Emily asks him to leave; Rory runs into Jess and they each betray their hurt feelings -- Rory about Shane and Jess about not hearing from Rory all summer; and Francie targets Paris and Rory for a world of trouble if Rory doesn't stop Paris from running the student council like a dictatorship. Rory's application for Harvard arrives, plunging Rory, Lorelai and Emily into a frenzy; a Chilton seminar on college applications only adds to Rory's anxiety and sends Paris into a tizzy; Taylor steamrollers Luke into opening a soda shop next to the diner; Lane places an ad in the paper for a band and finds a musical soul mate; Lorelai and Rory have dinner with a Harvard alumni and his family which may assure her chances of acceptance; Dean has a talk with Rory about their future after she goes to Harvard. Lorelai's stint in the Stars Hollow High School local business success speakers forum gets derailed by some controversial personal questions, much to the delight of Luke and the consternation of some PTA mothers; Luke and Jess argue about the women in and out of their lives (and their closets); Lane alleviates her frustration about the strictures of her household and the future of her band through a colorful, if temporary, display of independence; Rory runs into Shane one too many times and succumbs to a severe bout of snarkiness. Lorelai attends Emily's society auction where she meets a very handsome man but neglects to get his number, forcing her to ask her mother for it; after a disastrous first date, Lorelai turns down an invitation to another, not realizing that Emily and Richard have a lot invested in her dating this son of their friends; after Lorelai and Rory agree to water their new neighbor's lawn while he's out of town, Jess comes to Rory's rescue when the lawn's sprinkler system malfunctions. Lorelai chauffeurs Rory to Sherry's baby shower in Boston and finds herself dragged into the festivities against her will; Miss Patty gets a new beau; Jess comes home with a car and Luke tries to find out where he got the money to pay for it; one of Stars Hollow's more eccentric citizens requests a permit to mount a demonstration in the town square. Lorelai is determined to win the Stars Hollow Dance Marathon and wrest the trophy from four-time champion Kirk, but has trouble getting a partner until she finally convinces Rory to help her dance her way to victory. Dean sits on the sidelines to cheer his girl on, and is soon joined by Jess and Shane, who spend their time making out while Jess keeps his eye on Rory. Lorelai breaks her heel, and Dean takes her place while Luke plays shoe repairman. On the dance floor, Dean realizes that Rory is attracted to Jess and breaks up with her. Rory tearfully runs off, followed closely by Jess, and Kirk is declared the winner once again. In the aftermath of the Dance Marathon, Kirk parades around Stars Hollow with the trophy until someone steals it, while Lorelai and Rory painfully inch their way towards Luke's; after Lorelai tells Luke about Rory and Jess, he breaks up their first kiss as a couple and then lays down some ground rules with Jess about dating Rory; Lorelai and Rory reluctantly agree to accept Richard's invitation to accompany him and Emily to his Whiffenpoof reunion at Yale, where he springs quite an unwelcome surprise on all three women; back from New Haven, Lorelai and Rory head for Luke's, and Jess and Rory finally get to have those first kisses; Rory visits Dean to apologize and tell him that she misses his friendship; late at night, Lorelai and Rory each curl up with some bedtime reading -- the Yale brochure. It's Thanksgiving, and Lorelai and Rory have dinner at four different places: the Kim's, where Lane has managed to get Dave invited and Lorelai is forced to eat tofurkey; Luke's, where Luke and Jess make it a foursome with Lorelai and Rory; Sookie's, where Jackson and his family have deep-fried the turkey, the lawn and just about everything else; and Emily and Richard's, where, to Lorelai's horror, Rory reveals that she has applied to Yale. Kirk gets a cat, with disastrous results; Dave asks Lane out, and then kisses her; Paris is afraid her difficulty getting into a shelter will impact her acceptance to Harvard; and Dean faces off with Jess and lets him know that it's no more "Mr. Nice Guy" for Mr. Forester. Lorelai's grandmother arrives in Hartfo|`|9eba822c68da0888bb9357445e75d556aa	abc family|`|2ccaab4675deafebc1e2e3931e4d7f44aa	Holy cow you're about two seasons behind.  If you have the means, look for the DVD sets.  I have to warn you that this most recent season was the weakest - when Rory split from Lorelai and started living in Richard and Emily's pool house, the season went nowhere fast.  This was season 6 - I think you're at the end of season 3 or maybe 4.|`|790d85069bd749718ab000d01cce8cadaa	channel 5...you missed alot...go rent the seasons from somewhere...or beg your family//friends to get it for you on dvd for your b-day or x-mas....good luck catching up...lots has happened...lorelai and look get engaged but they may never get married...sookie has 2 children...rory gets to gether w/ this guy named logan (i think...i cant remember now...)from yale...she leaves yale..and moves into the pool house...gets kicked out of the pool house and moved into the main housin her grandparents house cuz they found out she "lost her treasure" (or how ever you want 2 put it)...    :)

The man looks around and sees no fire or people being tortured, nothing uncomfortable, and asks, "where is all the horrible things that Hell has to offer me?  I might as well get started now".    The Devil says, " Things have changed down here".    He asks the man, "Do you like to drink alcohol?"    "Oh, Yes!" replied the man, with a big smile.    "Well you are in luck", Says the Devil, "because on Mondays there is drinking all day, anything that you want"    "Wow, that's sounds great", the man says.    "How about sex?  Do you like sex?" the Devil asks.    The man replys, "Love sex, just never could get enough".    The Devil replys, "Well we will take care of that little problem, we have sex all day on Tuesday".    The smile continues to grow wider on the mans face.    He is then asked if he had any homosexual tendancies.    "Absolutely not!", he says emphatically, "I can't stand queers!"

95c56daef28be0fbd5b64e68ff210394aa	loved it.|`|f639092fc925bbd55e7b6272eeb17334aa	hard to believe Steve Martin wrote it.|`|432a2ac6e8e9326dda87639d40b172fbaa	She was my kind of girl: hot & a cheap slut.|`|AA10519920	i like it too....kinda odd but good.|`|ca356186da29fe5b0de4563a12b74829aa	yah love that movie!!!!|`|AA11821345	I want to see the movie, I read the book. I actually stole the book because this bookstore was selling it for $2 and I thought that was rude of them to treat Steve Martin like that, so I just took it. It's a good story though, I bet the movie is really good.|`|ca105eff9ac6d98a7efeae55acc41a6caa	I didnt think I'd like it when it started,but as time passed I liked it more and more...that one guy in the movie I thought was really funny!And Clare Danes is an awsam actress..I like the fact that she's so plain but yet pretty.And it was good to see Steve Martin in a not so comical role.
39f70042f5b628a3a61bafd8c4e9494baa	I think its a euphoric feeling he gets from this girl.    And Randy, the edited version is flying. The unedited it uses the f***ing|`|e56a50ad509db353bf37af6222663eb4aa	flying high kid. It's flying. And for the record I think the song is stupid.|`|ed77b684631a15604ec6d6ba1f0a55daaa	stuarts right.. thats how i interpret it.. that he was on drugs thats why he couldnt see her again and why why she was beautiful.. he wont see her again because he doenst know what she really looks like... because he was. fcuking high.. so he had an impaired vision of her... in high.. urgh it wont come to my head.. but i remeber thinking about it for ages!!! grr.. umm um um um... i duno i keep thinking of savage garden song.. high is just out my head il get back to you on that though...|`|ddfa8ed741cf9e6dab08f532ea602bbeaa	she is too good for him out of his league|`|eba259e29a59948370f9d2b2f03b82f8aa	It means hes high, ie on drugs, but using his feelings for the girl as the drug.|`|e39bf49fb64dde04aa4202e526e56792aa	It's jsut the character in the song.  He could have been high on her, as if she was a drug.  He could have just been a mess from getting high knowing he couldn't have her.  It prolly would have made it worse.|`|AA11711329	it IS effing high and im not really sure what it means either sorry!!
AA12378009	I would suggest getting either her newest album "ultra blue" which has Passion (the japanese version of santuary) or Deep River which has Hikari( japanese version of simple and clean). If you want to hear her english albums, utada has two of them. Her first album which is Cubic U or her 2004 U.S. Album Exodus. Both albums have a diffrent feel and style then her japenese albums. My favorite is Deep River, but Ultra Blue has some great songs on it too. So if your a new utada fan I would get Deep River. Also you can find her japanese albums at a virgin record store and yes the price per album is $40 if you buy it at a mainstream store. Her exodus album is much cheaper and you can find it on best buy. I just download the songs off of limewire or Hikaru-online.net in the community section ( you have to sign up which is free).|`|b84acb4295e3a6de6a9676b15342b900aa	the album easy breezy. i saw it one day at walmart.|`|df85f95e322e40287a2524ee2c837b96aa	Alot of people who don't speak Japanese like Japanese music.   You can find some music samples here.   http://www.j-fan.com/jpop/jpop.cgi?actio...    This is also a fan site and radio station(which is also available through I-tunes. My favorite is still "Distance." Listen to some clips available before you buy. It is not necessary to speak Japanese to buy CD's. Many are in English/Japanese and will convert the yen(Japanese money) for you, if applicable. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me.     Edit: Yes, they are but do NOT buy from them. They will charge you double what a Japanese cd store will! Also, be aware when buying that Japanese artists release alot of singles, moreso than they release albums. Watch for this when you buy, as an album will often come out later that includes the single.   Utada is one of the few in my area that is available at mainstream U.S stores. Artists like Ayumi Hamasaki, Koda Kumi,  are not so readily available.

3YRrGfkiaa	Lots of reasons. The production and composition on a Tool album is a heck of a lot more complicated than on an average pop record. Maynard does all kinds of side projects, so that probably doesn't help. They're also a mature group with an established following, so I don't think they feel any pressure to rush albums out of the door.|`|cbfbebe3dcfac916c8ff6dd76870aa34aa	? MAYNARD JAMES KEENAN.<br>  <br>  But, he is lead singer/writer for 'A Perfect Circle' and 'Puscifer' and does alot of work for soundtracks, etc. Plus, he has his own winery now, in Arizona.|`|AA10174980	I am not sure, but I think Tool broke up.  Check out the band "A Perfect Circle".  I am not sure which former Tool members are in it, but they sound very similar.|`|AA10334253	maybe that is one of the reasons......or maybe it is because music is difficult to write then add the chorus and the music parts all together in one album to please their listeners ears|`|AA10634271	Both bands are "people" bands. Meaning that they enjoy more the touring aspects than the album-releasing hype aspects of being in a band. Most bands make 1 album, and 1 tour, then another album, and then another tour and so on. Bands such as Tool, Metallica, and other bands of the same genre tend to tour for a longer time or even have several tours between albums. <br>  <br>  For example, technically speaking, Metallica has had 4 different tours between their last album and their next (Summer Sanitarium 03, Madly in Anger With the World Tour 04, Escape From The Studio 06 and soon to come Sick Of The Studio 07). Tool has had similar engagements.<br>  <br>  And it's always been like this for Metallica. For example, they had 3 different tours between the Black Album and Load (not to mention that the first of those tours lasted for almost 2 years!)|`|xk74PjbPaa	Tool seems to pick their time and place to release albums. and bless them too.<br>  The last album was a departure from the choice to voice religion, it attacked the lack of compassion the Bush administration has for our children.  that could take a long time to right with compassion.<br>  Metallica was incredible (my favourite is still and justice for all) and the black album and several after ward were viewed by their fans as pop.  I loved the "Black album" and liked "Load' but subsequently "re-load" and "S&M" were not felt out well.   I liked both very much, so they released "St Anger" which is an incredible album back to the roots of "Killem all".  <br>  Tool I think are a great thining man's Metallica are the great band in a vain of Pink Floyd...Thinking of a story sell a felling ( not the wall, listen to "the Final Cut")...<br>  NIN are a certain passion and I still think "The fragile" is the best album NIN ever did...new one concept..cannot wait..out today oh yeah I have to go!!!<br>  Tool...(See "lateralus") create such a great sound and think sooooooo much about what the piont is, I wait in baded breath to hear what is next.<br>  wait it is always worth it...

fe9fc615864878a4b6a6b9684fd2fa58aa	think Vanessa should be sent home b/c of her aggression. Clearly she is not a stable person. She clearly attacked Krystal first and Krystal only did what a normal person would do in that situation, which was defend herself. <br>  <br>  I don't like Krystal or her whiny ways and do agree alot with Vanessa on most things but what she did was childish and she should have handled the situation more adult like.|`|MASim4G0aa	I don't watch College Hill but I believe you have to give respect to receive respect. I don't see how the most minor situations get to the point of violence. Youngsters quite often give their power away too easily. Life is but a dream... it's for the living and we should love all our brothers and sisters.... especially those from around the world. We may not always see eye to eye but the line of communication should always remain open.<br>  If those roomates would communicate with each other instead of behind each others' backs... all will be well. Respect ya'll.....|`|4AH0kDh9aa	I think JT was the one that started the fight, had he not been dipping his nose into the V.I. kids conversation he and Idessa would not have started arguing.  Everyone knew that Vanessa did not like krystal, hell I don't even like Krystal. So the smallest thing or the smallest comment from Krystal rather it was directed to her or any of the other V.I. kids would set her off, which it did.  <br>  The Cali kids are very ignorant. JT is just stupid and confused, Fallon is two faced, back stabbing and phony, Krystal is a all around I wish I was a white girl B***H, Willie( I think thats his name) seems to be the only sensible one.  You can't go into somebody elses home and disrespect it the way that they have been doing. Krystal got exactly what she deserved. So when will it be Fallon turn to get what she deserves?

I bought a 99 cent Coka-Cola match box car and wrapped in it bubble wrap.  Then I put it in a padded envelope and had my sister type two labels.  One was this lady's address and the other said, ''Coka-Cola Bottling Company, Huntsville Alabama.  Inside the padded envelope with the bubble wrapped match box car was a typed letter which said, ''We here at the Coka-Cola Company appreciate your efforts to collect Coka-Cola memorabilia.  In recognition of this fact we would like to give you this gift of a collectors edition Coka-Cola match box car which has only been offered to our most loyal customers.  It is a priceless treasure which we hope you will enjoy for years to come.  Thanks again.  J.R. Tuttle / Vice-President of Marketing.  P.S. Happy Birthday.''  Her son told me her birthday was coming up so I added that to the letter.  About two days latter she received the package and was more than thrilled to have it!  She went to church and showed everyone the letter and the car.  She called friends and told them.  She placed the car with the letter on her mantel and told anyone and everyone that stopped by about her prize.  A week goes by, then two.  I told her son,''We need to tell her what's going on.''  He said, ''No, lets let it go a while longer.  I'll try to let her know with out actually telling her.''  So he went to her house and said, ''Mom, how would the Coka-Cola Company know it's your birthday?''  She said, ''I get a Christmas card every year from Al Gore so why shouldn't I get a gift from the Coka-Cola people.''  He didn't tell her any different.  Another two weeks goes by and by now she has told half the town about her car.  I told her son I was going to let her off the hook but in my own way.  So, I wrote another letter to her saying, ''Miss Delon, we are so sorry about the mix up but the car you received was meant for another collector.  Please rewrap the car and send it to the address below.''  (the address I gave her was my own)  She was furious!!  She went straight to the Post Office and demanded to know who's mailing address this was.  When she was told it was my address she then realized it was a joke.  But, this is where it gets turned around on me.  I go to the Post Office to get my mail and the Post Master, who is a friend of mine and was in on the joke as well, told me Miss Delon was very upset.  She told me, ''I wouldn't be around her for a while if I was you.''  Well, I just felt awful and had to go and try to straighten things out.  I pulled up in her driveway and she came outside.  She yelled, ''John!  What in the heck are you doing here!!  you're the last person I want to see!''  I said I was sorry and turned around to get back in my truck when I heard laughter.  I turned back around and she was standing on her front porch with her son and husband laughing very loudly.  She came down to the driveway and hugged my neck.  She said, ''Honey. I'm not mad at you.  That was the best joke anyone's ever pulled on me.''  That was about 5 years ago and she still has that car and the letter on her mantel.  When people come to visit she tells them the story.  It was the best joke I ever pulled and even when it was pulled on me about her getting mad, it made it that much more special.|`|bf6a6a7955d0f4912a14779ad84d737eaa	all the school administrators who told me that it will be easier to get a job if I had a college degree.

She's got that kind of twisted evil streak- she is definitely some kind of kinky.|`|bffe05b813a6d5248ebf57407160d97baa	idk but im the only one who answered hahahaha|`|98b4278dc15566640965cbe8b35c56a1aa	Samantha, and quick. Jeannie would bust out with something like cat claws on her hands, and Sam would set her on fire. Samantha for the second. Jeannies a dope. She'd probably let you do anything, but she'd just lay there. She's been trapped in a bottle- what does she know about gettin freaky. Maybe Sam would even call up some fellow witches for a crazy ritual! And she could wiggle her nose and hang you like a horse! She could probably do just about whatever she wanted with you, as long as she wanted. Wow. I have to go.....work on my motorcycle.....it's...broken..yeah,broke...

96qC7bY2aa	Take it as a compliment.  Ari's the best.  <br>  <br>  On the show Entourage, Ari Gold is actor Vince Chase's agent.  He does truly care about Vince, and would pretty much do anything for him- even if that's the wrong thing.  He's the type of guy you would want on your side, but not someone you'd want to piss off at all.  He loves his family, though he likes to pretend he doesn't.  He even likes Vince's manager/best friend Eric, though he finds it fun to torment Eric all the time.<br>  <br>  Here's how they describe him on Wikipedia:<br>  <br>  "A workaholic with a quick temper, constant sarcasm, frenetic physical presence."|`|c1dd18056c7abba38eb5d58766843f06aa	I agree with everything the first answerer said.<br>  He is so funny, sarcastic, quick and witty.

Your three-card reading is:<br>  <br>  You are fearless in the face of change.  Take up a new direction.  Get rid of unnecessary emotional and material baggage.  You are the only person who knows your true needs and desires, and therefore the only person who has any sense of what might be needed to fulfill them.  Live each day consciously - be awake to life's possibilities.<br>  <br>  You thought the last big change would polish you off, but you are still here, like a phoenix rising from the ashes.  Begin new projects.<br>  <br>  Goals and methods seek balance within you.  Universal law concerns the balance which transcends logic or rationality.  Like a tight rope walker, you follow your feeling.  An inner sense of order dominates events by referring them to their source.<br>  <br>  Seek a harmonious outcome to conflict, whether social or personal, even though what is just may not appear to be fair.<br>  <br>  You have reached the point of greatest liberation, as you have nothing holding you back.  Now you can begin to make dramatic changes within yourself, rebuilding without the waste and illusion of the past.  As you have nothing, any direction will be appropriate.  Out of change comes a more natural relationship to the world.<br>  <br>  You will have the opportunity to pursue new challenges, not because of personal choice but because of circumstances.  You will quickly see the potential for a positive result.<br>  <br>  Though the future portends tremendous upheaval around you, you can be assured that the outcome will be positive, no matter how it looks at the outset.|`|ee2e4261c26b451bcd2fbd6e77f27948aa	If you have to ask then no because there seems to be doubt in your mind.

He was a guest on Dancing With the Stars,  They had already finished taping all of the Bachelor.  When they asked if he  was really engaged, he said " Yes, I am".  I think he's a cute guy and has a tight bod, but he's really pretty boring.  I liked last year's Prince Lorenzo better.

2aa6585421c0e48790f21a9e08f64433aa	FILE SHARING<br>  File sharing is the practice of making files available for other users to download over the Internet and smaller networks. Usually file sharing follows the peer-to-peer (P2P) model, where the files are stored on and served by personal computers of the users. Most people who engage in file sharing are also downloading files that other users share. Sometimes these two activities are linked together. P2P file sharing is distinct from file trading in that downloading files from a P2P network does not require uploading, although some networks either provide incentives for uploading such as credits or force the sharing of files being currently downloaded.<br>  <br>  COPYRIGHT ISSUES<br>  File sharing (such as with the Gnutella and Napster networks) grew in popularity with the proliferation of high speed Internet connections, relatively small file size and high-quality MP3 audio format. Although file sharing is a legal technology with legal uses, many users use it to download copyrighted materials without explicit permission: copyright infringement or "piracy". This has led to attacks against file sharing in general from some copyright owners.<br>  <br>  There has been great discussion over perceived and actual legal issues surrounding file sharing. In circumstances where trading partners are in different countries with different legal codes, there are significant problems to contend with. What if a person in Canada wishes to share a piece of source code which, if compiled, has encryption capabilities? In some countries, a citizen may not request or receive such information without special permission.<br>  <br>  Throughout the early 2000s, the entire file-sharing community has been in a state of flux. In the year 2000, there was speculation over how seriously record companies and the Recording Industry Association of America would strike the file-sharing community because of its limits compared to more traditional forms of media. However, the communities suffered strain as record companies and the RIAA tried to shut down as much of it as possible. Even though they have forced Napster and Grokster into cooperating against copyright violations, they are fighting an uphill battle since the community has flourished and produced many different clients based on several different underlying protocols. The third generation of P2P protocols, such as Freenet, are not as dependent as Napster is on a central server; and as they encrypt the shared data, it is much harder to shut down these systems through court actions. Another attempt (used by the maintainers of KaZaA) is to change the company's organization or country of origin so that it is impossible or useless to attack it legally. To date, file sharing in Canada is somewhat legal, though not completely so. The uphill battle also extends to the legal actions taken by the RIAA and motion picture counterpart MPAA against individuals using file-sharing programs to distribute material protected by copyright. Ambiguity in the interpretation of copyright law has been a major factor contributing the lack of successful enforcement by the Intellectual Property owners. In Electra v. Perez for example, the Court ruled that the act of making such files available for distribution equated to infringement of the works involved. In the more recent UMG v. Lindor, Judge David G. Trager ruled that the RIAA would be required to prove that actual distribution (sharing) occurred. Should this case go to trial in 2007, it will likely set a precedent for further RIAA and MPAA actions.<br>  <br>  The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is a donor-supported group which seeks to protect and expand digital rights. Its activities include litigation, political lobbying, and public awareness campaigns. The EFF has vocally opposed the RIAA in its pursuit of lawsuits against users of file sharing applications and supported defendants in these cases. The foundation promotes the legalization of peer-to-peer sharing of copyrighted materials and alternative methods to provide compensation to copyright holders<br>  <br>

A representative for Electra has confirmed, "They are amicably separating."     A source claims the rocker has already moved and is practically living with his new girlfriend of five months, socialite Sarah Howard.     The couple have denied numerous reports that there was a rift in the marriage and continued to pretend to be together at public appearances.     The source says, "Carmen is so focused on her career, she doesn't even care.     Dave told Sarah it's totally over between him and Carmen. Everybody knows about Dave and Sarah now."     The former Baywatch star has toured with the burlesque dance troupe The Pussycat Dolls and is currently in London filming the movie I Want Candy.     This was Navarro's third marriage and Electra's second--she previously wed basketball star Dennis Rodman in Las Vegas, Nevada in 1998 and divorced him   less than five months later.     Navarro is currently hosting the second season of Rock Star: Supernova (premiere photos) alongside former Guns N' Roses star Gilby Clark, Ex-Metallica Bassist Jason   Newsted and Motley Crue drummer Tommy Lee. The show is looking for a new lead singer for the newly formed band Supernova.|`|6a1d329cc3b387442b523a01b0a5bcc7aa	yes after 2 1/2 yrs. of marriage but it's going to be a nice divorce between them.|`|64fcbf9546180e0ee4dd10a6ac7ddb58aa	Yeah they did.

The most important thing is eye contact when flirting. This is really the one single golden rule of flirting! Sounds easy, but can initially be difficult to establish for longer than a second or two. So when you next go out, find a guinea pig to practice on! Once you have decided on your target, look directly at him/her, then look away and always accompany this look with a smile. If they seem not to have noticed you, look again and this time smile directly at him/her. At first this really will be hard but once you get a reaction you will find your confidence will increase.     2. Once they have noticed you it is worthwhile having a few lines prepared for when they come over. However, if this does not happen, despite what you thought was a good reaction to your earlier eye contact, why don't you try approaching him/her? It could be that they are feeling just as unsure as you, so it's better to try rather than wonder what might have been.     3. When you do get to talk to them, always remember to be pleasant and smile whilst flirting - this will help put the other person at ease and also gives the impression that you are relaxed, even if inwardly you are shaking with nerves!    ~hope this helps.

Attitude: If you dont have it, you cant flaunt it. The best flirts are risk takers with an unshakeable confidence.     2. Humor: A must-have. One of the core elements of a relationship is the ability to make the other person laugh; be it at or with you.     3. Believability: You have to believe youre a great catch or no one else will. Period. If you dont think youre worth it, youve lost the game before its begun.     4. Assertiveness: Approach someone and start a conversation. And no, you do not have to be a male to make the first move. Welcome to the 21st century.     5. Accessorize: Not with jewelry and matching shoes, but with conversation starters like dogs, a good book, or a signature scent thats bound to attract attention.     6. Approachability: Nobody likes an ice-queen, or king for that matter. Force yourself to let your guard down and youll make yourself more approachable.     7. Eye Contact: Dont stare the other person down; simply give them the attention and respect they deserve. BONUS: Direct eye contact also shows confidence!     8. Have Fun: Nothing says comfortable like a person who is willing to let down their hair and be spontaneous and goofy. It goes back to that humor thing!     9. Sincerity: If they are truly interested in you, they will want you to feel comfortable being the real you. Dont be afraid to show a little vulnerability.     10. Smile: Not only does it show youre enjoying your company, its contagious, and it makes you one hundred times more attractive and approachable!|`|55aa2584a56e1b16721a641308d4df0aaa	Shake the junk in your trunk.

9PELZNtMaa	Lets start with the declaren nuclear powers:<br>  <br>  1.  Russia - yes they have theirs pointed at the the USa because Putin is an old paranoid KGB guy.<br>  <br>  2.  China - Mostly us, but I am not too afraid because they also point some at Russia and India.  They have one missile sub and I am sure we track it regularly.<br>  <br>  3.  USA - there is one missle squadron left and I would imagine they point more at Iran and North Korea.  The same goes for the subs and bombers.<br>  <br>  4.  UK - Iran is probably the target of the Tridents<br>  <br>  5. France - They have theirs pointed at various muslim countries<br>  <br>  6. India - Pointing mostlly at Pakistan, but a few at China<br>  <br>  7. Pakistan - All pointing at India<br>  <br>  8. North Korea - They maybe have 3 or 4 and probably couldn't hit anywhere past Japan or South Korea.  They will not because they are one shot and done.  They would not survive a first strike.<br>  <br>  Now for the ones that have them unofficially<br>  <br>  1. Israel - All pointed out in all directions.<br>  <br>  2. Iran - See North Korea, but I don't think they have one yet.|`|3e03cfeb1ce3e4ed640a6a1c7b02264caa	who is "us"~|`|XELVc91Vaa	who is "us?"|`|a6dsggSYaa	countless|`|yOhvx6AGaa	Oh quite a few.

Marijauana is NOT a narcotic. Methamphetamine is NOT a narcotic.     Opium IS a narcotic. So is heroin.

Holly (Audrey Hepburn) es una mujer joven de la moderna burguesa de Nueva York, que va de fiesta en fiesta hasta altas horas de la madrugada, buscando un hombre rico que la mantenga. Su mayor deseo es Tiffany's, la tienda de joyas de la 5o Avenida. Sin embargo, dada su escasez de dinero slo se dedica a juguetear con los hombres, sin querer mantener una vida estable o tan siquiera manteniendo su casa.  Paul (George Peppard) es un escritor que slo ha publicado un libro (ahora, su mquina de escribir ni siquiera tiene tinta). Es su amante, rica y algo mayor que l, la que lo mantiene y le da el dinero que necesita.  Cuando Paul se traslada al apartamento situado encima del Holly, ambos se conocen y se hacen amigos.   personaje de Holly (segun confesin del propio Truman Capote) se inspiraba en la actriz Carol Grace, por aquel, entonces mujer William Saroyan (despus, se casara con Walter Matthau).   Inicialmente, la pelcula iba a portagonizarla Marilyn Monroe (por expreso deseo de Truman Capote) y a dirigirla John Frankenheimer. No obstante, Marilyn, que por aquella poca quera enmendar su imagen de chica frivola rechaz el papel. Fue sustituida por Audrey Hepburn y est se neg a ser dirigida por Frankenheimer (No haba odo hablar de l y no quera ser dirigida por un desconocido). Antes que Hepburn, Kim Novak se ofreci para dar vida a Holly, pero su oferta fue rechazada.   Hasta hoy es una de las mejores adaptaciones literarias, hacia la pantalla grande, incluso supera a peliculas que anuncian personas que se dejan llevar por la mercadotecnia, como lo son Harry Potter, el Se?or de los anillos, El codigo Da vinci, y algunas otras modernas adaptaciones que nunca se compararan con las antiguas y bien realizadas peliculas de Hollywood, que son clasicas, aun por mas del mercado que existe hoy en el celuloide.|`|d19e2b35cf058b7b0bc8e5819b4d4a38aa	Nunca vas a encontrar una pelicula que sea exactamente como en un libro.

9mTctb7jaa	The Can Can is a dance, not music. The music you want to use is most likely written by Offenbach who wrote a number of very popular Can Can tunes. He died in 1880, so his music is public domain worldwide.<br>  <br>  However, the problem is not the music but recordings. If you plan on playing/recording the music yourself, that is ok. If you plan on using music off a CD you will find there is a circle P emblem which indicates that the recording is protected from unauthorized use by the recording company.<br>  <br>  You can find public domain recordings of this, try PastMasters PM129 from <a href="http://www.pastmasters.us/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pastmasters.us/</a>|`|hZCWDaoEaa	the song you're referring to that is associated with the 'can can' line dance is called:<br>  <br>  orpheus in the underworld <br>  <br>  I'm sure the song itself is copywritten, as it's very well known...the popular line dance associated with it, is likely not.

jlNW2wAaaa	Well, he's married and has kids, if that helps.  While he often jokes about homosexuality, often portrays gay characters (Chuck Noblet in "Strangers With Candy", for example) and has won a GLAAD media award for such, none of it means he's gay/bisexual in real life.  He's never mentioned his sexual orientation, but as I've said, he is married (not that that is the full-proof way to prove someone's orientation).<br>  <br>  So I think he's straight, even though I desperately wish he were at least bi- because then this little fangirl's slashy dreams (Stephen/Paul Dinello, Stephen/Jon Stewart) could have actually had a chance!<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

It contains no dialogue at all. The film focuses on a group of "man-apes" who encounter a Monolith, an object completely alien to them. After this encounter, the man-apes learn to use tools to attack prey for food and other man-apes in the conquest of territory.    In a match cut often described as one of the most famous shots of motion picture history, a victorious man-ape throws a bone into the air and the film jumps forward to the modern era, the image of the bone matched to that of a man-made satellite.    The remainder of the film takes place in a near-future time (presumably around the year 2001, as the film's title suggests). We follow the actions of a scientist or politician named Dr. Heywood Floyd as he travels to the United States' Moon-base "Clavius" to examine the discovery of a mysterious alien objectanother Monolith that exactly resembles the original Monolith discovered by the prehistoric man-apes. Dressed in spacesuits, Floyd and other scientists are touching the Monolith and posing for photos in front of it when a piercing tone strikes them all, presumably emanating from the Monolith itself.    Before any explanation is offered for the Monolith's tone, the movie jumps forward once again to its third chapter entitled "Jupiter Mission: Eighteen Months Later." The story here takes place on the spaceship Discovery One which has been sent on a scientific mission to the planet Jupiter. An entirely new mystery develops aboard this spaceship, apparently unrelated to the story of mankind discovering the Monolith: the intelligent computer aboard Discovery One, HAL 9000, rebels against the crew and murders all but one of them. The surviving astronaut, Dave Bowman, remains alive through a remarkable feat of ingenuity involving being ejected from a personal space vehicle without a helmet to protect his head. He manages to shut down the HAL 9000 and upon doing so a recorded video message from Dr. Heywood Floyd plays, describing the discovery of the Monolith to him and explaining that it sent a radio transmission to Jupiter.    At this moment the film jumps to the final sequence entitled "Jupiter And Beyond The Infinite." This is where the famous "cosmic light show" of the film, often labeled the "Stargate" sequence, takes place, as Dave Bowman arrives at Jupiter and encounters a Monolith (whether this is the same Monolith is unclear). Upon this encounter Dave is transported across vast distances of space and/or time, arriving in an earth-like hotel room, whereupon he is shown to age with great speed and finally undergo a transformation into a being that has become known to audiences as the "Star Child".|`|ef0594d17069eb2e7f9f8d4ab2be50efaa	The movie definately messes with your head but luckily my roomate happenend to be w/ me and guided me thru.

d1d6b46b71544bd11e11d8886427534eaa	Yes, this is correct. The time signature is 4/4 time which means 4 beats per measure. There are 2 dotted quarter notes which the dotted quarter note is 1 1/2 beats per measure (so 3 beats) and then there is the quarter note, which is one beat. This comes out to equal the 4 beats. Thus, making this correct.|`|c29533d5850c796331ad79b0d37775b7aa	Yes it is correct because the dot by the quarter note means to play half of the note before it, so therefore a quarter note followed by a dot would be 1 and a 1/2 beats.  Since there are two quarter notes followed by a dot that would add up to three and then when you add that to the quarter note standing alone it equals 4.

5b3547c9f69b578ae09c26b097b9b535aa	Probably so.    But, be careful.  They released quite a few songs (such as "No Leaf Clover," a re-make of a Thin Lizzy song called "Whiskey in a Jar," and "I Disappear" on the Mission Impossible 2 soundtrack) throughout 1998-2000 which hit the radio and video charts.

As a singer, I don't believe she has any talent but she was extremely good at promoting herself.  I agree with you!  However, you have got to give the woman credit for doing whatever she has to do, to keep her in the public eye.  Do not like her myself.  Never did.

AA11931794	Hey said that we sleep up side down, we are straight but the worlds gets upside down :)|`|AA11257113	Because they need to put their feet up.    Since bats are the only mammals who can fly, with wingspans ranging from 6" to 6', they failed to make great strides in the walking-about, or in the standing departments. Their legs and feet are simply not strong enough to support these functions for great lengths of time.    For this very reason, bats, when in their bat caves, or roosting in trees, take the weight off of their tired limbs by hanging upside down. Their breast-feeding babes, born live, as are all mammal offspring, have no choice but to hang in limbo with mom. Together, they reap the benefits of downward gravitational pull.  but your funny lol|`|002521522432890d51cc07af5d58f7d1aa	Nope just a little batty..............|`|d60f9ed43c65b16d6b22260cdd214dc4aa	They only want 2 experience the g-forces from blood rushing 2 their brains!!

So...once a muni asked this king to bring vethalam frm the big forest...u know this ghost always hangs upside down frm trees(now don't get excited!) so, whenevr this king catches this vethalam(oh..that's a load of a job...he has to climb up the tree..go to the branch...and u look down frm there u can see the whole world...na, don't look down !)  and tries to bring him to the muni...this ghost begins a story! most of the time when he is abt the middle of the story, vikramadithya's curiousness increases (just like when people come to ur home...u hang arnd them to find what''s in the packets they bring!) and he says sumthing..at that very moment vethalam flies away and hangs down frm the tree...really troublesome! (like u !) so..ok let the story stop there...so finally vikramadhithya succeeded?(well, I don't what happened..is he there near u...just ask him..coz all the masters of naughtiness are with u ..hmmm...!) and so..it's a true legend that these bats are vethalam's descenders...It' s said that at correct midnight..if u went to the batcaves(ah! the trees filled with bats!) and slow urself..u can hear their talks...and do u know what they talk of (gulp! to tell that to u is a big problem...coz the rest of ur life..u'll search for it!)  they talk of ancient long treasures hidden at various spots of the earth!  the recent talks that I have heard is that..well, U know ujjain....the ancient capital city..there....vikramadhithya has hidden his diamond rod..with 25 fluttering butterflies on it..it's said that the rod accepts a master only after testing him! well..hhhee I am not worried..coz U won't pass any of these tests..hahaha!) when u give the correct answers to these questions it's said that these golden butterflies wuld come alive from the rod..and fly arnd u! ! (ha! stop..baby..it's not playtime..leave those poor flies!) so that's the secret now! so, if u wish to go there to the batcave U really need to paint urself black(well, charcoal is more than enough!)  and don't make a noise( don't bite ur biscuits and make that snappy voice...don't bring ur mad scientist...he'll run arnd the cave and make batsoup...u and only u shud go...ahm...if my help is needed sure...but the profit half half ok? :)  and then we can listen what they talk..sh...don't tell anyone..it's the biggest secret ever! and u can be sssssssssoooooooooooooooo rich that u won't have to do anything in ur life..but sleep eat sleep eat that's it!  so, agree?                                  and it's to those priceless creatures u call out mad !! atleast respect ur vethalam baby! and whenevr u find a bat don't show ur teet out! well, that's another idea! ok, show ur teeth and u'll be good frnds..coz perhaps they wuld think u r a baby vampire !!                         danger: Don't try to hang upside down with them on the trees....we still need u here to hear what has happened of u...!|`|9b61393ddfa720e36dc34990e7e4916daa	Not really..|`|AA12351668	not at all it is their way,they feel comfortable sleeping like that...!|`|AA11282624	coz they are australian, mate.|`|b3fd9a65c9392e5131eff5687774bdb5aa	for the after taste  blood rushes to their head!!!

AA11832072	It was the season about the hatch and developing the tailies- the people in the back of the plane that were thought to have died. Umm lets see, season 2 also dove into the mythology of the show with the Hanso Foundation and the Dharma Initiative. But overall, it was mostly the mythology side. Next season is supposedly about the Others and what they're doing on the island. Look for the first episode on October 4th, with 6 straight weeks of episodes, then 3 months without any Lost, and then 17 straight episodes to close out the season.|`|AA12386189	that should not be lost give more details|`|AA11277776	If it is LOST how will we ever be able to see it or read it.  Oh whoa is me...|`|e92e869e98edcf7e6af91bc36e193cc3aa	Season 2 began airing in the United States and Canada on September 21, 2005 and featured 23[25] episodes. Most of the story, which continues 44 days after the crash, focuses on the growing conflict between the survivors and the Others, with the continued clash between faith and science also thematic in certain episodes. While some mysteries are resolved, more questions are raised. Several new characters are introduced, including the tail-section survivors and other island inhabitants. More island mythologies and insights into the survivors' pasts are divulged. The existence of The DHARMA Initiative and its benefactor, The Hanso Foundation, is established. The truth about the mysterious Others begins to unfold and a traitor among the survivors is revealed.

MICHAEL, HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!!|`|AA11656632	money & fame|`|4c1d9ccab8027238675b2f3d92df4b38aa	they are afraid of the truth.|`|781a13f75ad880928011b6076f8d8a74aa	people are dumb.      they just see him for who he was.  He's really a gay 12 yr old.   In a creepy 40+ body.|`|AA10836483	exactly why would you send your kid 2 a grown mans house, i think the parents should be charged!!!!!!  I know i would be at my childs side. so hmmmm maybe michael should frickn take them 2 the cleaners.  So you see its all a set up.  innocent until proven guilty.  hmmm how would u peepz liked it if some wacked out broke family accuse you of molesting their child and you didnt?????|`|AA10823959	Because they're insane in the membrane!|`|cef431cfe701d25a1298e3a28e9bcf77aa	Because some of those people are Micheal Jackson dying fans, and they fact they want everyone to know that he doesn't mess with young kids. That's BS because you know what if i was the parents of one of those kids i wouldn't send my kid to no grown wannabe innocent man in their house. Is the parents fault.|`|AA10572589	those of us old enough to remember when he was young, innocent, and black don't like the idea of him being anything else.  truth hurts sometimes.|`|d5333a5ae0039efc1cd863f31c76ea24aa	Public perception is that he is a "Kiddie fiddler", but you don't know what actually goes on in the court room, maybe the evidence truly showed his innoncence, and maybe he's really just a deranged guy (look at what he did to his face for case in point) that thinks he's really a child and likes to be around other children.  But he probably is just a child molester with enough money to make the system work for him.|`|c32625d33d1b391e7b8b2fe8a2021908aa	they lost martha stewart to camp cupcake and they didnt want their last reort idol to go to jail because of a personal petting zoo and a bunch of kids what a tragedy|`|b934057de9d292e8af49c856f1338095aa	Because he is usually kind and forgiving. I think that he might be innocent and I believe that he is getting abused in jail for something nobody knows is true. The kid might be lying because they never show his face or anything.
09d1f7163ce9ebfcadf9d98a75c6c0caaa	Finally another Weeds fan!! Best show ever!!!!  How awesomw that she married him and that Silas is poking the condom.  Let's celebrate Weeds!! Yeah!|`|d63d164ecd4bf7e97ca301c0da2d39c9aa	It's flippin awesome.      I kinda can't wait for the next episode. I saw Silas putting the holes in the condom.     The show gets more addicting every episode in my opinion.|`|3c156ae6ffcb20f6d5b5f4b34384d459aa	Up there with Entourage, I think Mary Louise Parker got dissed by not being nominated for an Emmy.
b0232c918ca7029d0f3b06ac75fce2c4aa	She said 'he was my father, my mother, my brother, he was you, he was me, he was all of us.' - and then they show in the crowd all the folks who were killed by the regime during the film - symbolizing (that's the key word) that 'V' was all of us, in all of us, and spoke for all of us (as if he spoke for all those who were dead as well).     Rent it again and watch it all the way through - its a great film and you will love it.|`|f918d0f3a1f16cb4fa8369331ddd9445aa	One big theme in the movie was that you can't kill an idea.  These people died for the idea, so they never are really dead.|`|bb18b6b62d2474ea9abc8d3607464643aa	The answer to both your questions is the same: The Wachowski brothers were trying to drive home the point that there's a little bit of "V" in everybody.  "V" effectively became the living (and martyred) embodiment of all those people who dared to think for themselves and have their integrity.|`|416a1305a7e1e1e514880ff731a32b18aa	no they weren't I don't know what you saw but they were still dead lol|`|0be46c091820b64f718fd3ce2c58fb64aa	you need to see the movie. i saw the movie and wasn't confused. i read your question, and now i'm confused!!|`|95c56daef28be0fbd5b64e68ff210394aa	it was portraying what what would lead of up to the downfall of a facist nation, and what could possibly make the citizens stand up and revolt against a facist government.|`|46c6b328af02b375d11f188e960bfcb4aa	Poetic License|`|59bd82b881b1614b130a927a9fe324b3aa	Ok, when the cops were talking when it was coming close to the date and time of the situation, what they thought was going to happen through one of the cops eyes is where it showed everyone dying but it was before anything happened.  When it actually happened, everyone did live.    The guy in the mask ment that he represented those people and all others in the senario.|`|3bdcbc9dbde70092ff34978300637379aa	Her friends and the little girl were dead they just represented something in the end. That was a Stalin type or comment. Like Mother Russia is the people that he was all the activists rolled up into on voice in a way.

AA11288101	harry potter - i grow up along with the characters ;)|`|f8316b851202bfa29e2b37b5add98d36aa	My personal favorite is Harry Potter, cause it's so easy to read and so multi-level, though Lord of the Rings is a long-time favorite.  There's no denying that, interesting and imaginative and amusing as it is, it's a mite tedious to plow through.  Never did manage to get into Narnia.  But while you're mentioning saga-type series, I would have to say my all-time favorite is Cherryh's Morgaine Cycles.|`|AA11667521	LOTR, for a few reasons.    I read it first (at about age seven, no less).  Characters feel like they could have been real people--just maybe.  Lots of detail.  It's probably the oldest of the 3 series.|`|AA10783295	None of the above, I'd choose George R.R. Martin's "A Song of Ice and Fire" Series.     Of the three that you've chosen up there, LOTR is the best by any objective measure.|`|c1119622f98946dc49f0f24c59104daeaa	In order: Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, and Dune. I'm not all that hot for Narnia.
d1d6b46b71544bd11e11d8886427534eaa	Blue October|`|4507080d087ea5233158c44546840f50aa	Blue October..........|`|dfc945129251f231b7f0e743d630dcb0aa	Its Blue October|`|7f7555a2cc8ecf6c6e07a10d52020c0aaa	blue october, i love them!|`|AA12043017	You know from everyone else now. Its none other than Blue Octocber's "Hate Me"|`|448ae9fe57ebcdd3c132783ccffaaf61aa	The song is Hate Me by Blue October      I have to block out thoughts of you, so I don't lose my head  They crawl in like a cockroach leaving babies in my bed  Dropping little reels of tape to remind me that I'm alone  Playing movies in my head that make a porno feel like home  There's a burning in my pride, a nervous bleeding in my brain  An ounce of peace is all I want for you, Will you never call again?  And will you never say that you love me just to put it in my face  And will you never try to reach me, it is I that wanted space      Hate me today.  Hate me tomorrow.  Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you.  Hate me today.  Hate me tomorrow.  Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you.      I'm sober now for 3 whole months, it's one accomplishment that you helped me with.  The one thing that always tore us apart is the one thing I won't touch again.  In my sick way I want to thank you for holding my head up late at night  While I was busy waging wars on myself, you were trying to stop the fight  You never doubted my warped opinions on things like suicide or hate  You made me compliment myself when it was way too hard to take  So I'll drive so ******* far away that I'll never cross your mind  And do whatever it takes in your heart to leave me behind      Hate me today.  Hate me tomorrow.  Hate me for all the things i didn't do for you.  Hate me in ways, yeah ways hard to swallow.  Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you.      And with a sad heart I say bye to you and wave  Kicking shadows on the street for every mistake that I have made  And like a baby boy I never was a man  Until I saw your blue eyes cry and I held your face in my hand  And then I fell down yelling "Make it go away!"  Just make her smile come back and shine just like it used to be  And then she whispered "How can you do this to me?"      Hate me today.  Hate me tomorrow.  Hate me for all the things i didn't do for you.  Hate me in ways, yeah ways hard to swallow.  Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you.|`|4b445bc2849d6a91fde42f9817959620aa	Blue October|`|d492a6242a3a804f9479d5da01ef30e3aa	BLUE OCTOBER, they r soo awesome! I luv em :-D

The publican says, "Don't tell me, you want a tooth-pick too"."No, a straw".The publican gives him a straw but is curious why he wants it,so he asks the tramp why he wants a straw and not a toothpick."Some bloke just threw up outside but all the good stuff is gone already|`|02f4244ec1550a22f338f289097f0722aa	Helmet being worn by the ant saved him..........|`|4192dd5f03afcb1f4e208fdade8a1fe5aa	wear helmet  save head

AA11784502	Hello ,  From what I understand Ghost In The Shell will be produced by Spielberg but I am unsure as to who will direct the film . The Wachowski brothers would be a good choice since they have already acknowledged that Ghost In The Shell was a MAJOR influence upon the Matrix trilogy .   "The Wachowski brothers, makers of the Matrix trilogy, have commented on the influence of Ghost in the Shell in an interview.[4] Producer Joel Silver also stated in an interview on the Animatrix DVD that he was shown the Ghost in the Shell movie during a pitch from the Wachowski brothers to indicate the style and look of the film they wanted for The Matrix."  "As of 2008, DreamWorks acquired the rights to produce a live-action film adaptation of the original manga with Steven Spielberg tipping the scales in DreamWorks' favor. So far, Avi Arad and Steven Paul are confirmed producers and Jamie Moss will be adapting the manga into a screenplay.[2] According to themovieinsider.com the film is set to be released in 2011."  Hopefully , they can do justice to this cyberpunk classic .  P.S. Ghost In The Shell was redone by Mamoru Oshii in a *2.0 version .    =^,,^=|`|3N2ElzcQaa	For all I know, I heard that Ghost in the Shell was going to be made into a live action movie. Although, I have not heard of which companies will be directing the movie.     Its still a little too early to find info on the live action movie since its going to premier in 2010.

Previously signed to Sony BMG with girl band Trinity Stone. One of the other members of the group was Mica Paris's niece Cherry - who is still one of Jade's best friends.    At twelve years old, Jade successfully auditioned for the role of Nala in "The Lion King" in the West End.    She has also appeared in TV programmes such as The Bill and Casualty, where she played a pregnant teenager.|`|gMYYzLP4aa	don't know but she definately looks familiar|`|KbhADKrraa	I don't know they all look the f*cking same to me!!!!!!
wZV2eaOmaa	Yeah, the basic formula is pretty similar between the 2 songs. Producers borrow heavily from each other...and other sources:)    And yeah there needs to be another section for stuff like that, maybe an R&B pop section or something. There are a lot of genres that yahoo answers has neglected.
72532a1cf9806107fc39d44e8390d61aaa	If your getting psychic reading online then all you have to do is pay them online with your credit card. You won't have a bill come to you but your bank or credit card statement will show the name of the company that you got the psychic reading from. But, no otherwise they do not bill you for a psychic reading. You pay up front when you pay with a credit card.|`|bGsH2sZJaa	dont do it it's a rip off !!!! i got one :(  go here     http://www.psychiccommunity.net/chat.htm...|`|uqDSuFMtaa	I would caution against getting an online reading. A reading in person is far more likely to be meaningful and accurate. Metaphysical stores, or bookstores, sometimes have readers on site. Psychic fairs is another way to find a reader. Or ask friends that have seen a reader what they might recommend. Your chance of being ripped off is much greater online.     My second concern with you is that you ask multiple "psychic" questions that, more often than not, do not need a psychic to give you an answer. They are better answered by you applying your own intelligence and common sense. Be careful that your love of "psychic" questions doesn't run up a big credit card bill.
5uvTte8Zaa	I gave it a listen and it was too off-key, out of tune, and kinda trailer-parkish to me.  Try this one:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINfmtyl6...

It was all the rage for the new Thrash scene back then.|`|aOZ7JPAgaa	I like it|`|eI9mkxS5aa	The "forgiven series" of metallica are my favourite songs. But I hate live performances, no artist can sound as good in a live show.|`|u0qHDTvtaa	ummm, its metallica, so its usually pretty good to begin with. the only album i wasnt happy with was St. Anger. that was aweful. but they seem to have turned around now. and yes, ur song of the day is great. where can i find girls with your taste in music?|`|7fEVNng5aa	I don't like it. Am I biased? Yes. I've only heard a handful of songs from Metallica, post-Justice, that I find interesting. This one was rather boring. Just my opinion.|`|ONWCXzUMaa	I'm not a big fan of fan favorites, I have many more favorties, besides what people down load or hear just what the radio wants, I have many favorites off the albums themselves. And I love most of Metallica,s music  take care  dave|`|FY8YYZgBaa	I do indeed like it.|`|ObeBvtzgaa	Good song =)

	Hey! I got your email and I responded... just incase you didnt get it, ill post it here aswell =]  Ok! im home =]  Lets see... breathing from your diaghragm. Well, the way I was taught was to fill your lungs from the bottom up. Imagine there is an inner tube around your weist and you want to fill it all the way around. (your back too... you want to expand all the way around). Then, you start working your way up. This should give you all the breath support you need! I was told by some of my teachers to breathe out of your mouth and some to breathe out of your nose. I breathe out of my mouth. Benefits of breathing from mouth: air gets to your lungs quicker and you can take in more air. Disadvantages: "supposedly" you "dry out your chords"... hasnt happened to me.   Benefits of breathing from nose: slower and more concentrated... deeper breaths. Dont "supposedly" dry out your chords. Disadvantages: takes longer to fill your lungs, can get pretty annoying (to me).  Second question.... you should never force anything with singing. It all depends whether you choose to breathe from your nose or your mouth. You exhale from your mouth as you are singing.  I really hope this helped you... let me know if you have anymore questions!|`|	I don't think it matters how quickly you inhale. You know if you're using your diapragm right liek this: Put a hand on your back and a hand on your stomach. You should be able to feel the expansion going on.     Also, try this link for diapragm breathing:  http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=7ExlDNioX_...    And I think breathing it's more whatever works for you. There is no right or wrong way to do this, if you feel right doing then it then that's all that matters.|`|	idk how but you support the air and get your breath by standing up straight take a deep breath and use your diaphram to exhale while your singing..well you know what i mean|`|	okay, i'll try to sing it :)i mean, i love that song.and i'd really love to hear your stuff too!  so, maybe i'll put it in my youtube channel next week.

xmdh8iY3aa	No. I think influence is an essential criteria in determining a GOAT (emcee or dj/producer).    Influence determines the natural progression of the art form. If you look at the top emcees of the past decade (Jadakiss, 50 Cent, Ghostface Killah, Kanye West, Lil Wayne(pains me to say it)) it's little wonder why we are seeing arguments if hip hop is dead. Not one of these guys is really influential. Not like a Rakim or KRS-One or Biggie.     i didn't include Nas and Jay Z because they are past their prime (1990's).|`|2Mvrxdn7aa	you can be a goat and not have been influential......think about it....rakim is one of the nighest regarded rappers, yet few say he influeneced their career...on the flipside, he had heavy prescence with fans and to this day is still respected for his flow. just like ll, he claims to be GOAT, but he has been very present...he went real hard in his younger years and battled hard!!!! not o9nce dd he nack down, even when he ripped canibus, but do you think he got respect??? not at all. don't get ne wrong, i don't think ll is the goat, but he is in that league...and I bet a few will agree.......|`|AA11118643	No because their impact is what makes them great along with skills.|`|PSuBYFSyaa	Well, chances are that if someone is bringin them into a GOAT discussion, then they have been influenced by that rapper. I think, in one way or another that every rapper has influenced someone, whether it be negative or positive|`|6fxr3VBGaa	no, your influence is an important part of you being the best|`|vFj2GMP4aa	No they can't because your style has to be admire by many.  But influence should not be the only determining factor.|`|os6FaEBlaa	I would say they should, because if they have great skills, and someone is willing to bring them into a GOAT discussion then they influenced someone enough for them to say they could be the GOAT.|`|3Q4ijBQOaa	No, I don't think so because influence is one of the main criteria. Just like I don't think a rapper can be considered a GOAT without having a classic.

You said best "SINGER" not most famous or who you like...  When I think of best singer, I think of someone who gives me goosebumps while I'm listening....      Beyonce - She's trained! Great entertainer, I wouldn't say the best    Alicia Keys - Underated singer maybe cause she doesn't show enough "skin". She shows thats not what talent is about. Very Soulful!    Keyshia Cole - Up and coming. I think she's too big for herself right now.     Mary J. Blige - Legendary - 18yrs & still active in the industry. Many thinks she screams alot. No, it's called emotions.    Selena - I haven't really listen to her other than her song from the movie. No Comment - RIP     Left Eye - not the best singer but good person overall - RIP    Missy Elliot - not the best singer nor rapper for that matter. Very creative mind and producer.    Ciara - good performer. I like watching her perform but as a singer.... she's working on it    Mariah Carey - Legendary without the DIVAtude. 90's Mariah would have taken it all, but since she doesn't sing anymore, she WHISPERS, she doesn't win this one.    Jordin Sparks - up and coming. I think if she continue working with the right people and not go "Hollywood" she could make it out here. Powerful voice.    IMO - The winner is Mary J Blige.|`|xSk6McMXaa	1.Beyonce  2.Mariah Carey  3.Alicia Keys  4.Ciara|`|Ql5JuWAiaa	here's my order  beyonce  marj bilge  Maria carey  keyshia cole  alicia keys  ciara  selena|`|I7zbXq6raa	when it comes to singing i'll say it's Alicia Keys and when it comes to overall performer i'll say ciara and beyonce|`|xmdh8iY3aa	Talent wise  1. Mariah Carey  2. Alicia Keys  3. Beyonce  4. Selena  5. Mary J. Blige  6. Jordin Sparks  7. Keyshia Cole  8. Ciara  9. Missy (she's a rapper)  10. Left Eye (ditto)    My 3 favourites  1. Mary J. Blige  2. Keyshia Cole  3. Mariah Carey|`|kuxVB76maa	ne-yo

ETGMj8Hoaa	wtf!, well aquarius are just detached and independent in or out of a relationship, they are a fixed sign so they keep that mood always....     edit: i would say sooo, libras are cardinal they are good at beginning things but to continue with them? no, geminis are mutable love to separate come back or change the tone of the relationship and aquarius are fixed determined so yeah i think they are loyal and good in commitment but I think the difficult part might be the beginning.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	From my experience Geminis are not afraid of commitment.  They love being in relationships but, remember, Gemini can love two...so they will date other people even when they are in a relationship.  Fidelity is not their strongest trait.    Edit:  Yes, Aquarius seems to be more of the commitment phobe.  This is just from my own experiences.

OMMYpccraa	I love them all.  The highlight of my breakfast is the fruit of the day.  Apple, banana, grapefruit, peach, watermelon, strawberries, raspberries, apricots...  My favorite fruit is the one that tastes like it's supposed to taste. The specific fruit that will be awesome for those two weeks in the years when it's "in season". You can have strawberries all year but when there're in season, they taste great. Like raspberries. I only make my raspberries cake during the two weeks the raspberries really taste great. Like cherries. I love cherries but they taste great only two weeks a year (when I make my clafoutis). All the fruits now are available all year long but people should remember when there're supposed to be in season and taste great. I'm tired of all year long expensive raspberries that taste like nothing if you're lucky.|`|de7bf90bb2066bf0f7dc80a921ffc779aa	Plums, Pineapple,|`|1db73d3555d7ff56398659d7d827fc91aa	i like alot of fruits but my top two are     1.

That's your friends girfriend!". I would probably be turned off for the fact that she's been doing my friend in the first place. In all honesty I would deny the offer. It would look good in my books when I arrive at the pearly gates. It could create some leverage, taking into consideration the dissaster of a life I used to lead when I was a hormonal teenager.|`|mZveBvHVaa	why not? shame to turn down some booty.|`|yiajPCGAaa	avoid her like the plague|`|AA10637979	hey!  i want to answer too!  i'm flattered when girls want to hook up with me    i was that attracive girlfiend in your question before.  my boyfriend encouraged it.  shame on him.|`|fBUBxxiIaa	It's okay as long as he's there when it happens.|`|56f5c42c0ffc0cc4c08bf00d970f587caa	I was in the same sort of situation before.  My friend's g/f kept trying to get into my pants.  And I have to say, it was quite a turn on.  I didn't do anything though.  I wouldn't do anything like that.  It turned out that she was doing the same thing to another person in our group of friends as well and everything exploded into a horrible drama battle for a long time and it broke apart the entire group of friends I had and we were good friends.    5 years later I'm just now becoming friends with him again.  If I had slept with her, there might not even be that.  Stick with your friend man.  She is being immature and selfish.

Tal vez te gustara regalarle algo de Stanley Kubrik: Naranja Mecnica (A Clockwork Orange), Ojos Bien Cerrados (Eyes Wide Shut), Lolita, The Shining (El Resplandor), o algo de Oliver Stone: JFK, Natural Born Killers (Asesinos por Naturaleza).    Para algo ms comercial, pero muy bueno tambin tal vez algo de David Fincher: Se7en (Los Siete Pecados Capitales), The Game (El Juego), The Fight Club (El Club de la Pelea).    Si te quieres lucir, busca una pelcula Internacional (no Hollywoodense): Das Boot (El Submarino, de Wolfgang Petersen), Der Untergang (La Cada, de Oliver Hirschbiegel), Cinema Paradiso (de Giuseppe Tornatore), La Vita e Bella (La Vida es Bella de Roberto Benigni), El Mtodo (de Marcelo Pi?eyro), La Tesis (de Alejandro Amenbar)... En este sentido, y viendo el corte de pelculas que le gustan (misteriosas, enigmticas), tal vez te gustara buscar la espa?ola Abre los Ojos (con Penlope Cruz y Eduardo Noriega); ten cuidado, pues hay una versin hollywodense que se llama Vanilla Sky, con Tom Cruise, y (si, tambin) Penlope Cruz.    O los clsicos: Casablanca (con Humphrey Bogart), el Halcon Maltes (The Maltese Falcon, primera pelcula de Film Noir), Charada (Charade, una excelente y divertida pelcula con corte de espas, con la guapsima Audrey Hepburn y Cary Grant), Zorba, The Greek (Zorba el Griego, excelente, con Anthony Quinn)...|`|0e7719b3673329b663376e5079fb12b7aa	Si estudia cine, yo le regalara "Velvet Goldmine".

You HAVE to unplug the guitar, when you aren't using it, or the battery will drain overnite.    3rd  make sure you are pressing all the way down, it does take a lot of pressure to turn it on/off  that is so that you don't "accidentally switch it off.

Are you planning to be arrested a lot? Maybe a carreer as an escape artist? Well, yes, I have done it before. In the back of a cop car. I had drugs in my pocket and I managed to stick them between the seat cushions. The trick is to break into a good healthy sweat so your limbs, (especially your shoulders) are ultra flexible. You have to roll over , curl your knees into your chest, exhale completely, and flow through the handcuffs with your toes pointed inwards, simultaneously. If you're in fairly good shape you can do it. It hurts some at first.

Porque en cada sitio que ests,  porque en cada sitio que est,  en las cosas que vives, yo tambin vivir.  Porque en cada sitio que ests,  no nos queda ms que un camino,  solo habr dos amigos, tan unidos.

Best rapper ever has gotta be ( Thizz N Peace) Mac Dre.|`|ff6fa4aedb2c8d0eaa3cb783e3b5622caa	It needs a good beat; preferrably something danceable (and I don't mean shake your butt kind of danceable... I mean the real dance of hip hop--breaking) since hip hop did come out of a party scene after all. The MC has got to have good rhymes. In a way, MCing is like poetry... it's about the rhythm of words, rhyming, puns, metaphors.. and it should have some good burns if possible.     Best examples I can think of: Erik B. and Rakim, Freestyle Fellowship, Big Daddy Kane, Jurassic 5, etc.    :-)

While I like the Judas Priest, Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden type stuff. I don't consider screamo to be metal. I'd almost bet that if you gave it a chance, you'd have to like some type. It is powerful. And the type I listen to has a melody, a beat, and you CAN understand the lyrics, despite what my parents said when I was 14(26 years ago). You should sample some, as I can't imagine living without it.

En la TV apareca abriendo "El libro gordo", que creo tena tapas azules -basado en la enciclopedia del mismo nombre q se venda en fasciculos semanales en los quioscos- y ahi presentaba un tema en forma breve, unos 5 minutos. Era muy educativo, todo con esquemas, ilustraciones, habia una voz que iba explicando -no la del mu?eco- y terminaba con estos versos "El Libro Gordo te ense?a, el Libro Gordo entretiene, y yo te digo contento, hasta la clase que viene!!!" .....

Lo que posiblemente "fastidia" (por asi decirlo) un poco, es el hecho que aparezca "La Marca" al final...    Por ejemplo, anuncios de BMW, que suelen ser muy buenos, pero al poner BMW al final, te quedas un poco "Choff". Otros en cambio buscan atraer al pblico con el anuncio, como el mtico caso de "Be Water My Friend" de Lee. Son anuncios que impresionan siempre.    Posiblemente pues, creo que actualmente, el anuncio ms reciente que me puso la piel de gallina era el de "Televisin Espa?ola" (TV1) 50 Aniversario.

19f75038e4498ed23d91cab08f8c29fbaa	Ay no puede ser!!!!!!! has de cuenta que he tratado de encontrar esta pelicula como loca... y no la he conseguido. "Great Expectations", hermosisima, extrana, irreal, magica, sonadora pelicula. De mis preferidas si no es que mi preferida. La vi hace anos y me gustaria volver a verla. Tenerla.  No te voy a contar muchas cosas para que la veas por ti misma pero basicamente trata de que:  Habia una vez una senora de edad grande que practicamente estaba algo mala de la cabeza, pues desde que la dejaron plantada en su boda, tiene todo el jardin con los adornos, las mesas, etc en fin todo intacto claro que con telaranas, polvo, etc. Ella tiene una sobrina, o no recuerdo que parentezco, como de unos 10 anos, entonces invita  a un nino a que vaya a su casa, a el nino le gusta pintar, y hace que el haga retratos de su sobrina, en fin pasan los anos y ellos dos van creciendo juntos, a tal grado que el nino se enamora de la sobrina, llegan a ser adolescentes y asi pasa el tiemo hasta que cada uno toma su camino, Estela la sobrina, se va, y esto le parte el corazon a el nino, este sufrimiento le satisface a la tia pues ella practicamente hizo que convivieran para que el se enamorara de Estela y al momento de que esta partiera el sufriera. El se va a Nueva York y triunfa como pintor, y el destino los vuelve a unir, pero esta vez Estela a punto de casarse, el la busca y........ creo que me excedi. Lo que pasa es que no se sabe si Estela esta enamorada o no del muchacho (no me acuerdo del nombre) ero nuevamente lo hace sufrir... pero al final...... pues ya lo veras.  Excelente pelicula basada en la novela de Charles Dickens.   Es algo diferente a las demas. Vela.

La escena en que este ltimo es violado por Andy Mac Dowell (el veterano actor que hizo "La naranja mecnica" hace muchos a?os). Tal vez no slo la violacin en s, sino los sentimientos que despierta por las secuelas que trajo (el suicidio del violado).... la participacin de este actor fue breve, pero en mi opinin, se lleva la pelcula..... es como que una se pone en el lugar de la vctima (que era heterosexual)..... y es impresionante, en mi opinin... , el impulso de suicidarse.... porque al parecer haba tenido alguna reaccin a ese acto involuntario con otro hombre, y eso lo habra confundido acerca de su sexualidad... algo as.

	All 13 year olds like swimming so that a good thing that you have a pool. There are a lot of pool games that you can play. It depends on how big your trampoline is, but you can play some really fun games on there. Playing soccer in a large backyard is fun too and much less costly. 13 year olds are capable of finding thing to do so don't stress to much over it. A tip is to play some good music too because that kinda of thing is in. Even if you do play the radio it still works.     :) I hope these ideas help.

e197e0c067a6a1ec49ca488cab4f6747aa	Dave Allen's comic quotes       Allen's material often focused on sex and religion     Comedian Dave Allen, who has died at the age of 68, was best known for his dry-humoured TV shows, Tonight With Dave Allen and Dave Allen at Large.   His routines, delivered while perched on a stool holding a glass of whiskey, were considered ground-breaking for the way in which they took satirical swipes at topics including sex and religion.     "He tried to show the hypocrisies of the world as well as its funny side," said the BBC's head of comedy Jon Plowman, paying tribute to Allen.     Here are some of his most famous quotes:       "I still think of myself as I was 25 years ago. Then I look in a mirror and see an old bastard and realise it's me."     "Am I the Irish comedian with half a finger? No, I'm the Irish comedian with nine and a half fingers."     "I don't go out of my way to be outrageous, I just go out of my way to look at things."     "I'm an Atheist...thank God."     "I've stopped smoking...I think the cost was a lot of it, and not being able to breathe. I first gave up smoking when I was eight."     "A good storyteller never lets the facts get in the way."     "We spend our lives on the run: we get up by the clock, eat and sleep by the clock, get up again, go to work - and then we retire. And what do they give us? A clock."     "If it's sent by ship then it's a cargo, if it's sent by road then it's a shipment."     "Don't mourn for me now, don't mourn for me never - I'm going to do nothing for ever and ever (what Allen said he would like to have inscribed on his tombstone) "    "Goodnight, thank you, and may your God go with you"|`|c32a7d3812e789f3808f3e51a9327d9daa	I do remember him and his show was very funny.  He came to American TV when cable TV emerged, late 70's early 80's.  I can remember his and Benny Hill show were both on about the same time.

I7zbXq6raa	Ciaras upcoming album, Fantasy Ride, may feature a slew of hitmaking producers, including Tricky Stewart (Rihannas Umbrella), Danjahandz (Britney Spears Gimme More) and Missy Elliott (Jazmine Sullivans Need U Bad). But according to Polow Da Don, only he and CiCi have something special enough to become the new Aaliyah and Timbaland.    We both came up and were raised in the same camp, Polow explained to MTV News. Weve known each other for a long time. We actually just have this natural chemistry that I dont even have with some of my own artists.    I understand her and I understand what she should be doing, the producer added. I look at it like this: When I work with her, Im a fan, and this is what I want her to be doing.    The two recently put their chemistry to work on Ciaras new single, Never Ever. The track, which features Young Jeezy, is the Atlanta singers first official single from Ride (tentatively due in April) and follows the warm-up selections Ahh and Go Girl. (Shes shooting a video for the clip this weekend in Atlanta.)    The singer told MTV News earlier this week that Never Ever is one of those real records.    Im singing about [when] you go through the confusion of love, she said from the red carpet of the Notorious premiere. And, basically, I say, If that boy dont love you by now, hell never ever love you. And sometimes we wait around and we go through so many different things. And if that person is not showing you the affection you need and not giving you the right love, then you got to let it go. I talk about the confusion of love  being confused about staying or leaving or letting go.    The songs chorus takes its inspiration from Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes If You Dont Know Me by Now. But unlike the classic original, Ciaras version is more likely to be blasting out of sound systems.    Hard midtempo is back, Polow said. Where dudes can ride around in their cars and listen to R&B and not feel like a girl. ['Never Ever'] is hard like a rap record, and thats why Jeezy had no problem jumping on it  cause its hard.    And one thing people do say about when I work with Ciara is that I make her sound better than ever, he continued. I make her sound like a vocalist versus the other stuff she may do thats more performance, where she can get on the dance floor. Its kind of the same thing with Aaliyah. She may not have been the best singer, but her voice was so unique and her sound  she had her own lane, and I think Ciara is like that same thing|`|kuxVB76maa	That she will "Never Never" make a hit again.|`|2yR2mSnUaa	it means that if you've been with a guy for a long time and he's still not treating you right or loving you, he never will, so you should just leave him: http://www.mtv.com/videos/news/330968/it...|`|U9HdoeWVaa	it mean if yo dude dont love u by now he will never ever love u  ya kno if he still playin games then thats what its gon be

sc4BtGxGaa	Nothing is perfect - but some things are a HUGE help.  You can do this with Sibelius - I know, because I HAVE - and betcha you can do it with Finale, too.  I am NOT my my computer right now that has Sibelius running, otherwise, I would check and give details ( if I have time, later . . )  But there is an *arrange* feature.  First, you have to get that piano music digital - and SO much has already been done, see if you can get a MIDI off something like www.classicalarchives.com before you do all the work.  Then, You open four new staves in Sibelius, highlight the piano line, and then use the ARRANGE function to paste it into the 4 new lines.  You will get plenty of warnings and questions - use your best judgment, and do it.  This presupposes that most of the piano music is in no more than 4 simultaneous parts - and some of THOSE are going to end up in the wrong SQ instrument (easy to drag where you want.).     MUCH depends upon the original piano work.  Something homophonic, like a hymn, goes easily - I suggest you practice scanning (if you will need to scan your original piano work) and arranging THAT first.  And if your piano music is particularly problematic, you will wind up with a mess.  Heck, until you learn how to handle this program,MOST things will be a mess.  If you have not scanned music into a notation program before - I hope you have a lot of patience.    I have looked over plenty of original sources, and said - the heck with the amount of cleaning-up I will have to do - might as well enter it note by note myself, making decisions and placements as I go.  Shortcuts often take MUCH more time that they are worth.    I certainly hope that you are OK with the copyright issues involved.  Just because you CAN do something, does not always mean that you should.|`|vsy4QMHMaa	It really depends on what you are transcribing. If you have a piano reduction of an orchestral piece, you could probably get that to work out in four-part. If you've got something written specifically for piano, like Fur Elise, you are up a creek.|`|jgEvnYNlaa	I have never heard of such a program and I will be a monkeys uncle if you can find one. I think the best you can do is try to transcribe it your self. Sorry.     The easiest way to try to transcribe it is to have the cello play the bass parts and the violins and viola the rest of the voices.
ac1a6479288f17bb65e4bddb7637c089aa	Est ai uma boa pergunta. Eu penso que a ilus?o seja um estado mental aonde ns confundimos o que vemos, com o que temos e o que secretamente desejamos.Iludir-se  acreditar que as coisas est?o indo por um caminho, que h indcios fortes que as coisas tomar?o firmemente aquele caminho baseado na autenticidade confusa de nossos sentimentos e perspectivas, e esquecemos que h algum alm de ns que pode nos surpreender ao contrrio agindo de uma forma que contrara o que achavmos que ia acontecer.Iludir-se  um acreditar incostentvel baseado t?o somente no sentimento.S se ilude quem realmente cr.  uma coisa louca de se pensar mesmo, porque quem se ilude n?o  porque n?o teve forte convic??o de que as coisas seriam de uma dada maneira, mas quem manteve essa convic??o a tal ponto que esqueceu-se ou sublimou internamente as probabilidades de tudo ir "ladeira abaixo".  Iludir-se  um acordar dentro de um processo em que julgvamos estar acordados.Iludir-se, s vezes, tambm  n?o contar com a fraqueza do outro diante de nossos desejos por aquela pessoa.  N?o sei exatamente o que fazer com nossas ilus?es, mas acho que esclarece-las j  um bom passo.Perguntar a ns mesmos: Minha f est sendo vlida?Ser que n?o estou querendo ver que h um hiato, um ponto obscuro, embora tudo me leve a acreditar que pode dar certo? Na verdade pode sim, mas tambm pode ser que toda essa f peculiar que o iludido tem, seja apenas uma proje??o de seu desejo numa pessoa que n?o pode aceitar o convite.A f que ele tem que o sentimento pode transformar e mudar tudo, parece incontestvel para o iludido.N?o sei at que ponto n?o percebemos que as coisas podem fenecer diante de nossos desejos mais sinceros e que nossa f pode n?o alcan?ar coisa alguma no outro.  Iludir-se para mim  isso.Agora o que fazer com isso eu n?o sei.Manter-se lcido?Desconfiar dos prprios desejos e das pessoas com as quais queremos compartilha-los? A culpa  porque imaginamos demais? N?o sei.N?o sei o que teramos que "matar" dentro de ns mesmos para n?o nos iludirmos mais.Talvez nossa pessoa inteira?|`|c56860ada3604afaeb2066804061fcb6aa	Jog-las no lixo....

In addition, just because somebody exhibits certain personality traits does not mean they will choose to act them out negatively.     Some of the closest and most loyal people I know are Geminis. One of my best friends is a Gem, and she is always there for me when I need her. My boyfriend is a Gemini, and he is the most loyal, loving, devoted guy I could ever ask for. He goes to the end of the world to help me out, and he never asks me for a thing in return.     Don't listen to stereotypes, people are just so much more than that, and so is astrology.|`|KifasiMraa	a typical Gemini can sound untrustworthy.  People say that they have multiple personalities, are always off and running after the next new thing (while leaving YOU behind), and can be ditzy to boot. Some of ex boyfriends and crushes showed these personality quirks.  However, my step mom, who I love dearly is also a Gemini and she's very trust worthy and awesome! The most untrustworthy thing she ever did was accidentally let a Christmas surprise slip.  and that was more of a "She knows not what she does." kind of thing as opposed to being deliberately untrustworthy. So don't judge a person by their sun sign, or else you won't the full story :-)|`|Sl0UPcheaa	You can't judge people by their astrological sign. That is just ridiculous.

84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Aries + Taurus    Out in the "real world," next door neighbors often don't fully understand each other's needs, then again maybe you two could find love with the sign next to each other. Just remember that when you're involved with an Aries, you're involved with an explorer, a risk-taker, a thrill seeker and a pioneer. When you're involved with a Taurus, you're involved with a sensualist, a nature lover, an indulger and a money lover.    If you can give an Aries action, excitement and a fresh start, they you have a better chance of getting their love and affection. If you can give a Taurus security, beauty, nature and pleasure you have a better chance of getting their love and affection.    At heart, Aries is more of the self-starter. Taurus has more of the power of persistence. Taurus may need for Aries to cool it from time to time.    Essentially, if Aries wants to be happy, Aries needs to be first and best. Somehow, some way, Aries need to find a competitive outlet. On the other hand, Taurus needs to be assured that everything's O.K., safe and secure. Once that's taken care of Taurus is ready for gracious living. That is to say, Taurus needs some good food, antique furniture and passionate sex.    Taurus likes to touch nice things, own nice things, wear nice things, eat nice things and have nice things. For Taurus touch or the physical world is real and gives comfort. In fact, "I Have" is something of a philosophy for Taurus.    Aries begins life with the question posed to every solar super hero, "How will you use your super powers?" Aries is here to start something new, to go where no one else has gone and to do what no one else has done. The stars dare Aries to be a pioneer, a champion and a doer. Sexually, Aries has got some naturally hot stuff.    It is important that Taurus acquire some mastery over the physical, practical and earthly world. Then, paradoxically, Taurus must learn to let go. Taurus will only find security by acquiring a sense of self that is separate from possessions. Actually, it's not so much about what you possess Taurus, but about not being in "survival jeopardy."    This relationship involves a test of patience.|`|ykIleAQ7aa	Going off sun signs no this is not a good match. Your complete chart determines how compatible you are.|`|XVGmGCDaaa	Taurus & Aries   One drives the couple forward; the other stabilizes it. Aries rushes in with enthusiasm, whereas Taurus takes the time to think and slows the pair down. In bed, these differences make for a spicy and passionate relationship. The former finds needed common sense and security with the latter, whereas the latter delights in the former's spontaneity and fury... as long as Aries doesn't upset the other's daily routine too much, or arouse jealousy.|`|PFVqo1wkaa	actually taurus and aries are complete opposites. aries is very social and likes going out late at night, or party sth like that. taurus prefers staying at home and just chill. they're likely to learn many from each other. opposites attract sweetie :)

Leda2ha0aa	I really think it is going to be Stefan or Jamie.    Notice that in the last episode, the guest judge was telling Jamie over and over that he really thought she was a wonderful chef and it was so great to watch her prepare her food.  I think that was a clue that she will be going a long way in the competition.    I think Fabio was still until almost the end.  He's entertaining with his broken English and accent.  I think the judges really like him.|`|QQbSIrBxaa	I love Hosea!  I am cheering for him to win.  He is original and has a distinct POV.|`|BzP0JX1caa	I LOVE Fabio!!  I want Jamie or Hosea (or Fabio) to win.  I don't want Leah or Stefan to win :)|`|ddMJr1l1aa	I don't think Fabio cooks very well. He's there for the demographic. He brings in the young female viewers. He should have been eliminated that last challenge, not Jeff.     Stefan and Jamie are the two best in my book.|`|IH2R1zcDaa	I love Fabio but it's true, he has not been cooking well. And despite the fact that Stefan is far too cocky, he IS very talented so I think he'll probably win.     I think it's pretty clear that neither Leah or Carla will win for sure. Leah has little talent and no confidence in her food (I don't like her personality either). Carla seems like a good person but she isn't consistent at all (I also can't stand her crazy facial expressions, haha).

Relentless tour, but if they would come back to England, I would go and see them, even if they were all the way in London.    Their songs have extremely deep meaning to them, and, even if you don't know the English, you can still love the songs.   I have known about Dir en Grey for a while now, but Kerrang! have made them much more famous over in England now, and they've already conquered America and Japan with their music.     Go Dir en Grey, I say. ^_^|`|FzQBUSwVaa	I love Dir En Grey XD   Their Music is Different =D  |`|5jceEq9gaa	They're actually my favorite band    :]    I've known them for about 3 good years.

AA11921320	It sounds like you might be referring to Stichomancy, Libromancy or Bibliomancy or simply the intuitive sense of finding just the right answer to your question.      When I shop for books I stand or sit and wait for a book to call to me.  I don't browse the books or the shelves but something will nudge me to pick up a particular book which I take home to find a perfect find.  Do you do that too?    Some onfo on Stichomancy from Wikipedia:    A book is picked that is believed to hold truth.   It is balanced on its spine and allowed to fall open.   A passage is picked, with the eyes closed.   Among Christians, the Bible is most commonly used, and in Islamic cultures the Qur'an. In the Middle Ages the use of Virgil's Aeneid was common in Europe and known as the sortes Virgilianae.    Because book owners frequently have favorite passages that the books open themselves to, some practitioners use dice or another randomiser to choose the page to be opened. This practice was formalized by the use of coins or yarrow stalks in consulting the I Ching. Tarot can also be considered a form of bibliomancy, with the main difference that the cards (pages) are unbound.    Another variant requires the selection of a random book from a library before selecting the random passage from that book. This also holds if a book has fallen down from a shelf on its own.    Bibliomancy is a type of Stichomancy: "divination from lines". Some sources refer to bibliomancy as a specialized form of stichomancy, often falsely attributing the word root "biblio" to "the Bible", rather than books in general.|`|2cc5b6b3e067fca80d88d8898a7b6638aa	yes, usually they ask me to look at the index|`|8531ad23f07efdb2af658b8bf062727faa	da ?|`|fb2bc5066e973c116ece4c08fc55a9d2aa	dont touch books they are evil|`|AA11857038	yeah told me to look it up myself or lean a hand|`|mJUbNJA7aa	"Read further, Grasshopper, you will see."

If watch the webisodes, this wouldn't have made much sense.    The vague idea is that Gaeta was accidentally supplying an Eight names of people in the resistance who she would later track down and kill. Gaeta was under the impression that she was trying to help them. Baltar knew what happened too.    Hope that helps. =D

1lh7oQsPaa	First, before you start trying to sing scales that are out of your range, listen to them and IMAGINE singing them, just don't let any sound come out.  Over time, this actually conditions the chords so that they're more prepared for the higher range.    You also need to discover your middle voice... Sing a not at the low end of your falsetto & notice that you feel it vibrating mostly into your head... Now sing on a low note & feel how that fall sin your chest.  Then sing the higer note, but concetrate on bring the the chest & head sounds together so they meet in the middle...      Finally, a voice teacher taught me to SPEAK  a high-pitched "Wheeee" sound, raising the pitch of the "eeee" until I hit the note I was trying to sing... Then she'd tell me to remember how that note felt so I could SING it that same way...    Hope some if this helps.  Best of luck.|`|vcGydoTaaa	don't try too hard to go out of your range! you might hurt your voice! but if you want to go higher or lower do scales that go a little bit higher and a little bit lower each day!|`|ZbEF9KoXaa	just practice it helped me.|`|bjdSKkvCaa	you can sing higher by practicing a scale. Also while you at school or work you can do it when you get bored. Two perks it will get your voice higher and you wont be bored doing it. I Hope it works out for you. Best of Luck|`|LdhTl7acaa	Doing various vocal warm-ups will probably extend your range without much effort, by at least a few half-steps. Depending on your age, I wouldn't suggest trying to go as high as possible - regardless of age, you will end up straining your cords and possibly damaging them. Call around your area for vocal teachers or trainers and ask them if they can help you in a one-on-one setting.
8d5e7Z5Oaa	"Crash Diet" and "Just Another Sunday" were both early GNR demos probably recorded some time in the 80s. - Nothing to do with Chinese Democracy or the next 2 albums.    "Shadow of Your Love" was released as a b-side to "It's So Easy" in 1987 and another version was the b-side to "Live and Let Die" in 1991. - Nothing to do with Chinese Democracy or any upcoming albums.    "Dust in the Wind" was a Todd Rundgren song that GNR covered in 1993. - Nothing to do with Chinese Democracy or any upcoming albums.    "Oh My God" was released in 1999 on the End of Days Soundtrack.  It probably will not appear on the next 2 albums.    "Silkworms" was played live in 2001 and might still be on one of the next 2 albums.    "Oklahoma" has been renamed "Berlin" and will probably be on one of the next 2 albums    "No Love Remains" was a title mentioned in Kerrang in 1999 and has been confirmed as a fake by Axl.    "Sex, Drugs and Rock N' Roll" is a song by Dave Tieff and has nothing to do with GNR.  http://www.mygnrforum.com/index.php?show...    I'm guessing that "Strip Bar" and "Livin' Loud" are just made up titles.  I haven't even heard of them.|`|Vl6g2YD8aa	Wow...I never even knew about these songs..It'd be great if they show up on a new album.

vBUQVqwHaa	I really like Philip Glass. I know his earlier works as well as his new things and there's a big evolution in his music. He manages to use the same kind of minimalistic structures over a period of a couple of years, whereas others have different structures in each piece. And yet, his music is always interesting and different in one or another way.    Things you should have heard:  Akhnaten  Symphony nr 2 and nr 8  Concerto for saxophone quartet  Concerto for two timpanist and orchestra  The witches of Venice    Note that I also like John Adams, but for me Glass is better, because he uses his musical material in such a great way.|`|AA12373921	I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know,  I'm not sure, I'm not sure, I'm not sure, I'm not sure,  Who can tell?

One of the few contemporary composers whose music happens to have some lyrical AND intellectual content is Lowell Liebermann.    Philip Glass=a thief. I SWEAR he ripped of his themes for Notes on a Scandal from Barber's overture.|`|AA11748005	John Adams.  I think his music is more highly developed.  I consider the other composers minimalists but Adams as a composer who uses minimalist techniques.      He's also probably the top opera composer living today.
AA10460506	The best indie bands can't really be found simply by using a p2p program. You'll have to search an independent musician website.    Try www.cdbaby.com This is a site I know about where most musicians who are 1/2 serious about their music will most likely have anything they couldn't afford to physically put in every store nationwide.    Also www.pandora.com and www.last.fm are two great free sources to find independent music. I'm still working on getting in Pandora!    You might enjoy my songs. I have about 20 or so of my solo tracks you can download for free at www.soundclick.com/dustd     Also, if you go to www.defyantalliance.com you can find some dope tunes. I can get you those tracks for free.    Please share with everyone! My music is always free.
h4m7JJRRaa	Scorpio men likes to test people a lot. Yes they DO have something going on in there eye. Very Protective, but one thing that scared me the most is that, they never stop getting suspicious. Even if you tell them the truth, they won't ever stop digging on your personal life. Of course not all Scorpios are like that i'm just talking about the ones i had experience with. I had only known two male Scorpios in my life. One was very sexy and the other one LOVED talking about sex. Like the topic about sex would just POP out of nowhere. lol|`|8ZUVToXgaa	they are seeeeeexy.

They can have a BIG head as far as Ego goes, but they can be the most loving most eerily Loving challanges there is. I Love my Scorpio Man. We are so much alike that people used to think we were brother and sister. LOL. They are innocently Mysterious but there is just something about them thats so lurring. Once in love with a Scorpio, Always in love with a Scorpio ! But when they get bad feedback, be ready to pay the consequences because they dont take no **** and they will verbally let you have it.In a Non chalant kind of way.Before you even know what hit ya. lol. I wouldnt give up my Scorpio eagle for nothing.The Scorpio is the one and only sign on the chart that represents 3 totems.The Scorpions  stinger,The Eagle,and The Butterfly. And in Chinese,they are either Dogs or Rabbits/Cat.|`|0y0hgeWDaa	i am in love with a scorpio/sag cusp..  sexy as hell  and those eyes.. and his smile.. oh my goodness|`|w8c9wRSiaa	As I cancer female I love them :D    Positive: everything. we just click personality wise.   Protective & funny without being childish probably my fav traits.  I know it says scorps can be selfish but he really wasnt. He was a very nice, go with the flow, down to earth. Selfless guy. But WITHOUT being a push over. And without seeming desperate. He gave me the right balance of feeling protected, secure, loved, & needed. But not too much to where the relationship would dull fast. The longer we stayed together the stronger our bond got. We became best friends but still lovers. We were together for a little over 2 years. it was a almost perfect relationship.   I miss him now. he moved :(    Negative: nothing really. I actually like when he gets jealous. its cute. well I guess he could be kinda cold & a little harsh when aggravated.|`|4jRShQsXaa	Yeah it's definitely in the eyes. They have the kind of eyes that pry into your soul and make u wanna rip all your clothes off! lol. I have dated one and im kinda talking/seeing one now. Im not exactly sure why im so drawn to them, we make the worst match.....im an aries. The are very intense and passionate. They are usually the ones to initiate love first. But be careful because if you don't remain somewhat mysterious yourself they lose interest and will disappear out of your life and leave you wondering, "what the hell happened". Try not to fall into their game of information fishing. They don't always like the answers they get and this can cause tension. You can't be a jealous woman either. You must have a very strong sense of trust in them because they do attract alot of women and they like that fact. If you trust him just laugh it off. He'll come back to you everytime if your a confident woman. Always be honest with them because they are extremely honest themselves. Its best to talk about whats bothering you instead of holding it in with them because they will find out anyway. They seem to pay attention more so than any other man I've met, even when you don't think they are. Tip: Never yell at them or put them down. You will be sorry!!!!!!! Love them and treat them with respect and they will be your lover and your best friend.

hTiVaz8naa	Por gracia , no todos los seres humanos somos iguales, pensamos diferente, unos creemos que solo debemos tratar ciertas cosas que son en verdad interesantes y con contenido,  pero hay personas para los cuales la vida es simple, superficial, y todo a la ligera, creo que deberiamos adoptar un poquito de esa superficiabilidad para poder vivir en este mundo tan caotico.    saludos|`|c7ff3cc931cc9a9738302784fe229049aa	no lo puedo creer q te pongas mal x eso ...todos tenemos derechos o no? a lo mejor a vos te parecen sin sentidos pero para otra persona es lo q quera o necesitaba saber y hay quienes contestaran o no uno elije...bueno tranqui  no te pongas mal solo elije contestar las preguntas q estn a tu nivel el resto de jalas para los q preguntamos o respondemos tonteras pero nos justa participar en yr en los momentos q no estamos leyendo ni mirando  ni un film ni en el gym|`|3045ea66343e3cf909cc5c3270e4cb47aa	bueno mira hay que ser prudentes y hay que saber sobrellebar a los demas asi que ten paciencia con aquellos que preguntan imprudencias. recuerda que tu alguna vez las preguntaste y por otro lado veo que aqui has respondido a mas de 250 preguntas asi que ojo algunas de esas son preguntas idiotas, aunque para el que las pregunto no lo son.  lo que para unos es un vaso medio lleno para otros es un vaso medio vacio, todo depende desde el punto donde lo veas.    Ahora bien si es verdad que se puede conocer a las personas por sus preguntas o respuestas, esto es por lo siguiente. si tu haces una buena pregunta, bien formulada por ejemplo de los aztecas, yo podria pensar que eres una persona que ha leido y que sabe de esa cultura. pero si tu solo preguntas que quienes son esos cuates o que si los aztecas eran piratas que vivian en el atlantico, pues por la pregunta se que es una persona que no sabe nada no tiene cultura ni tiene estudios ni nada.  de igual manera si te responden con bases y saben de lo que te estan hablando pues sabes que esa persona esta estudiada en el tema y sabe de lo que te esta respondiendo.    cuidate mucho y besos...|`|32bdeec0745934693e7668774cad6565aa	Pues creo que hay de todo!!!!    hay gente que pregunta idioteces sin esperar ninguna respuesta, hay otros que tienes preguntas y dudads y hacen por preguntar, otros que se crean la neceisdad de preguntar temas que ellos creen importantes.

Sinceramente pienso, que ( bueno, por lo menos mi caso), que se entrar para curiosear, compartir opiniones y descargar tus pensamientos aqu de modo ( mas menos annimos)    Conoces opiniones de gente de otros pases , intercambias conocimientos ( quien los tenga) jejeje    Y pasa un rato entretenido!!!    Yo paso por4 esta web casi todos los dias desde que descubr este  situo a responder 4 o 5 preguntas!!!  Veo films, hago deporte y quedo a charlar con los amigos!!!

70feca160dc8d8687e919d208f40c8a1aa	bleu no compitio el mismo a?o que pulp fiction, la que si compitio fue "Trois Coleurs: Rouge" que es la ultima de la trilogia, pero no fue nominada a oscar como mejor pelicula, estuvo nominada en categorias como guion y fotografia, bleu es como de 2 a?os antes. En mi opinion Bleu es la mejor de las 3, si las has visto notaras que cada una trata de los 3 valores tradicionales en la cultura francesa: libertad, igualdad y fraternidad. y que la fotografia destaca su color de maner especial en cada pelicula. Pulp Fiction es una obra de arte de Tarantino, pero son diferentes, todas buenas.|`|a2a3deaea4cb092073af2d2e24c1c175aa	A mi me gust, pero Pulp fiction me parece mejor.  igualmente no creo esa informacin que tenes, ya que Pulp compite por Mejor Pelcula (hablada en ingls) y Blue por Mejor pelcula en idioma extranjero.  Igualmente el Oscar es una mentira, en general no premian las mejores pelculas ni de casualidad (tal vez Pulp Fiction sea una de las pocas excepciones, si es que gan)  Las otras 2 de la triloga de los colores (Blanc y Rouge) estn mejor que Blue.
0cdcf8b729a9e15c9ee4503779633e89aa	Saludos.  En toda Amrica se maneja el NTSC como un formato general para DVD's, videojuegos, peliculas, y aparatos electrnicos. En Europa se usa el formato PAL, asi que no importa en que parte de Amrica compres tus DVD's, podrs verlos en tu aparato de DVD.    El unico problema que puedes tener es la regin pero eso se soluciona con un DVD que sea multiregin y ya la mayora son de este tipo.|`|e8fe8c11afd221bf0c60fe704cf3bfa1aa	Y para que quieres ver DVDs teniendo a tantas brasile?as lindas por ahi??|`|c9a1469df6f7f33f678ed3f905846236aa	Son las regiones, amigo.
fb3d4605a31bf625cfad08144889ec87aa	Pues tengo entendido que el director  Lars von Trier tiene pensada una triloga as que "Manderlay" es la segunda parte (la primera se llama "Dogville" y en esta Grace es interpretada por  Nicole Kidman).    Para mi son excelentes pelculas. Son una especie de "irona" ya que la pobre Grace trata de "mejorar" al mundo (bueno, ms bien a los pueblos con los que se topa, es decir, Manderlay y Dogville) pero termina haciendo justamente lo contrario o en el peor de los casos: a la gente no le importa lo que hace Grace por ellos y terminan usndola.

And this Monday, Christmas Day, we will be    with my wife's side of the family to have a    wonderful time with her family as well.  I am    looking forward to this also.

2iDW3uFpaa	I agree with you but this event could help Antonella anyway, unlike some of the other contestants, people know her name and now she can talk about those pictures. She will get publicity  and may eventually get a record deal like many of the Idol finalists. She could become a model. There is no limit to what she can accomplish. Feel bad for her now but be optimistic for the future. She is a beautiful girl and she will have no problem making money!|`|PxcLRCPUaa	Are you kidding she posted most of those pics herself. Yes she will probably get with playboy or something else that sells sex. Antonella definately loves the camera!!! I think she acted fake and like a brat. Antonella cannot sing she has no talent. She did recieve fair and just treatment. That is what being a celebrity is when the media has gotten it in for you, smile keep going strong no matter what to win back your fans. If she was'nt trying (in which sadly I think she was) then she deserved the dismissal even more.|`|4b661443fa3ba8f96e35514f39ce6b80aa	No, she couldn't sing from the get go.

It was sooo funny. Not sure when it will be out, and we were told that we were the first audience seeing this rough print. I must say that he built an entire movie on that one character. It will def. be rated R, as it has some pretty wild stuff. Some bathroom humor, yes, but all in all, it was great. Several scenes were so funny that you couldn't hear the film. The theatre was going wild at several points during the film. He makes fun of so many different things that anyone is fair game.    I hope he continues to do his show and find the time for more films based on his wild characters. After seeing the whole movie, I was left wondering if all those people it is were actors or real people being caught off guard.

Es irnico, porque hace 20 a?os yo escuchaba a Los Beatles, que ya estaban separados...., y no a los Stones, que continuaban haciendo nuevas canciones... creo que influy esa mala fama de los Stones como violentos.  Hoy por hoy, adhiero a los Stones y el estilo de Los Beatles me parece un tanto "naif".  Y cabe destacar que soy bastante fan de los RS hace slo unos 2 a?os, me incentiv el haber compardo el CD solista de Mick Jagger, "Goddess in the Doorway"...., me encant, ah particip un buen  tiempo del forum www.mickjagger.com. que de paso me sirvi para practicar Ingls, y por esas cosas del destino termin viendo dos conciertos de la gira.... probablemente los primeros y los ltimos. Y comprend que es verdad una declaracion que habia leido, acerca de que los Stones, y en particular M Jagger, adems de la msica, eran todo un show con una organizacin impresionante, otro detalle que los diferencia de los Beatles. Para ser justa, creo que toda buena coleccion de CDs debera contener trabajos de ambas bandas, as como tambin de Elvis Presley, por ejemplo.|`|6ec43a3f2d09730db080d1d2ec97a92caa	Si es por preferir, prefiero a los Rolling Stones. Cuando hablamos de gustos no se puede explicar nada ms, tiene que ver con lo que cada uno siente al escuchar msica, las sensaciones que te provoca determinada cancin, por su letra o su meloda. En la banda de sonido de mi vida los Stones han musicalizado buena parte de la historia, as que por eso los prefiero.    Me parece buena tu idea de preguntar por la preferencia o el gusto, porque creo que son grupos tan diferentes desde la historia, desde lo musical, desde sus contribuciones al rock o al pop que no se pueden comparar. Cada uno se lleva sus mritos.

They will mastermind a way to take control of the airwaves and let the people know their emotions and reasoning abilities are being toyed with...     Movie and television executives will call on Spider Man to bring life back to normal.  Spidey will comply when he realizes how much money on endorsements he will lose out on if he doesn't wrestle back the control and influence over the minds of the general public.

LOL    So honestly, The singing lacks something to be desired and they won't be calling you to replace Eddie Van Halen should he break another hip.   But some positives to look at are really in your song writing skills. You seem to have a good lyrical ear, a strong sense of melody, and you know the typical pattern for a song.    Since your asking should you give up on music, the answer is certainly not. If it makes you happy. Play it. Will you get rich doing it? Not unless you give yourself an honest assesment and work on the area's where your weak. Kudo's for having the nads to put it up and then open yourself up to contructive criticism.

nF7g8nphaa	Subconsciously, Yes.     One of the summer issues of 2001 The New Yorker magazine had an illustration of the Twin Towers depicted as a sandcastle on the cover.    In the back pages of The New Yorker there are many small advertisements.     Shortly after the 9/11 incident I was looking at these advertisements from the summer editions and I noticed a square ad' enclosed in a black box. It was for a graphic design company. The line drawing depicted the Twin Towers with an airplane flying between them.|`|41f250e890923fedf85e19be6b82cb3faa	Here is someone who actually predicted it, he did so on radio on june 28th 2001, so it is a matter of recorded fact, he also predicted Osama Bin laden would be blamed.

NgL2Onqhaa	From what I understand the series has yet to be renewed for a ninth and the writers do have a 'Series Finale' on paper for the end of this, the 8th season.     However its possible that CW could still order a ninth season, as I believe that for a Fall season they have until the better part of May to make up their minds, and even longer if they take a page from Lost, American Idol, or 24 and do a 'New Year' season    the possibility of an SAG Strike which i believe is still a danger, could abbreviate this season, and give them other options. The Biggest danger in waiting, for what ever reason, is that the cast might get other job offers that would conflict with a season 9 shooting schedule, and either mess up a 9th season or hinder the actor's post-show career    This notably happened with Remington Steele in the 80's, we were almost spared Timothy Dalton as Bond, but NBC opted to re-up Remington, and keeping Brosnan from taking over the Bond Franchise directly from Roger Moore. and who knows where Bond would be if not for this|`|zcWC4Aelaa	wiki doesn't say anything about a 9th season    season 8 has aired 14 episodes as of January 22nd out of the 22 ordered.    they probably won't announce anything until the seasons over.|`|xn0yM5VYaa	There is a good chance there will be, but it all depends on the CW.

If he wasn't there, there wouldn't be an Entourage. He just has an awesome supporting cast!|`|q82cqg3raa	Technically, the main character is Vince, because without him there would be no entourage. Although Kevin Connolly (Eric) is the first in the role credits...  The main characters are 5 btw (Vince, E, Turtle, Drama and Ari).  From the most important to the least important:  - Vince  - E (there would be no Vince without Eric)  - Ari Gold  - Drama  - Turtle (he has the smallest role, I think)|`|rabjcdjHaa	Even though Entourage centers around Vince and his career, I think Eric is the main character of Entourage.|`|ZllVlBNqaa	Vinny Chase - the show centres around him.

XJqPzSbTaa	I assume that you're looking at Madrigals and other choral music. The use of 4/2 and 3/2 type signatures has more to do with choral vs instrumental traditions than medieval/later. Instrumental music developed in a more rhythmic style so group quavers and crotchet-quaver rhythms made the music more visually recognisable. Choral music retained a sense of timelessness.     See this for more info:   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_notat...|`|vsy4QMHMaa	It's a ploy by the ink industry to sell more product. If nearly every note needs to be filled it, then there's a whole lot more ink to be sold.    ... honestly, I don't know, and don't really care why we went from minims to crotchets and quavers.|`|ThKkn5fKaa	I honestly have no idea, but I'd be willing to make an educated guess.    I know that the earliest written music, plainchant, had no measures.  There were just phrases.  I wouldn't be surprised if, once time signatures and measures were introduced, those long phrases were just made into one measure.  So a single measure would have to be fairly long in order to accommodate the entire phrase.  Again, that is just a guess of mine.  I'm sure that one of our resident early music fans might be able to offer a better answer.
4HWGOZVSaa	, Michael-Joel David Stuart|`|aDDZu9bPaa	Jordan Johnson is a fictional character in the BBC soap opera EastEnders. He is played by Michael-Joel David Stuart.    He is the son of Lucas Johnson and the half brother of Chelsea Fox, who arrived on Chelsea's birthday with his father. and he is 12 years old.[1] It was revealed by Lucas on 26 May that Jordan's mother had abandoned him.    He later appeared when Yolande Trueman tried to get Chelsea to bond with him, and he found cocaine in her handbag. Chelsea tried to pass it off as Sherbert but Jordan wasn't deceived and told her that their dad helps drug addicts.    Jordan appeared again on June 26, 2008 when he had forgotten his key to his father's flat, Yolande took him back to the B&B. Denise Wicks, Chelsea's mother, wasn't very pleased at all with the fact he was there but eventually enjoyed his company.    On August 1, Denise gave Jordan a lift home and brought him some fried chicken. Jordan explained to her that Lucas had told him everything about his teenage drug past and how Lucas' friend, Jordan, who he was named after, died after being shot.    On December 12, 2008, Lucas asked Denise to take Jordan to school as he had "something to do". Later that day, Jordan left the square with his father Lucas after locals blamed Lucas for Tony King being allowed to work with children. Jordan and Lucas returned to the Square a month later and stayed at the King George B&B before preparing to leave for Leeds.    After Denise proposed to Lucas, Jordan revealed to her that Lucas was still married to his mother, Trina.

CotABvTjaa	i don't like it because its taken over the damn world!!! Look at what it takes to make rap music........lousy cheap lyrics usually degrading women and talking about gettin high in nightclubs with strippers ok.....a peabrain with no musical talent but a high libido.....and electronic synthesizers and voice enhancements.....     Now rock on the other hand is something that is rooted deeply in history and goes back a long time....it has developed into all different kinds that suite a wide variety of tastes...and the talent and instrumentals are real! The lyrics have more meaning as well (im not saying there can't be bad rock bands out there because there DEFINATELY can) My heart will forever be with rock!
euZRbiA2aa	Funny you should mention degrading woman this is the only rap lp i ever bought.Enjoy.2live crew.    http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=5sc_nQiuDN...|`|iJzlRCkOaa	I dislike 50 Cent, Lil' Wayne, Fat Joe, etc.  That rap is undeniably sh*t.  The "artists" don't make their own music and the songs are just talking about getting drunk and and going to clubs and girls with big butts.  Stupid.  But I don't dislike rap.  There are many rap artists (Aesop Rock, Mase, Eminem, Xavier Naidoo, Tupac, Beastie Boys and more) that I listen to and have a lot of respect for because they make their own music and it actually has meaning.  I don't hate rap.  Just mainstream crap.|`|1vCoaf08aa	Old school rap like the 80s actually had something to say, that I respect, although I don't like the music.    Today rap is just as bad as modern rock, it's commercialized and all sounds the same, but honestly, what makes "Killing cops, raping women, big butts, and gun fights" awesome?|`|BuOHv2XKaa	I like the instruments 50 Cent uses,  And I love Lil Waynes voice when its not too computerized.|`|ayC3MsEWaa	I honestly don't mind some rap songs but i depends on the artist and the meaning of the song.  I don't like rap because some of it sounds like hate music and yelling corresponding to music. Some artist I don't mind though. Rap has really changed over the years from what it used to be.|`|t7U9rliVaa	It's just never been my thing.  There are a few selected songs of the genre that I don't mind, but in general I'd prefer not to listen to it.|`|RfI6Im7Aaa	I hate it to.I mean i dont wanna hear stuff like oh im gonna tap dat *** while i drink out a glass who wants that. i like rap with a meaning to it like a story not going to the club. i rap im 16 and i have story raps and like one of them in the club songs but alot of people like that **** but i dont. go here to listen if u like www.myspace.com/concept304 thanks
64JPpW5qaa	When Twilight was written, I'm sure the author didn't say,  "This series is only for girls".   My bestfriend is a guy and he read the book.  I think its cute actually haha.  But if you want to read it, go ahead.  It's just a book.  It doesn't tell your sexuality.  And no one should think that either.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Your sister is sexist.    The series is meant for every teen, meaning for both boys and girls.    Its just that there's a lot of romance in it.|`|0nzRviJQaa	no i don't think it's a just girl book only  but it tends to appeal to a female gender considering it's a love story  i know about 4 0r 5 ish people who read it but over 10 who saw the movie   most had good things to say about plus i read the first 2 myself and thought they were great books    i hope you enjoy it|`|klhFMdCgaa	Hey dude if you want to read it, go ahead.

KhGkc2QGaa	The best thing to do is practice hands alone first. I've been playing for over eight years, and I still do this. Become familiar with your right and left hands alone, then gradually put them together.    It's best to start out with pieces in C major, that way you don't have any flats or sharps to worry about.|`|KX8oWwDzaa	Read up on Billy Joel, he's the ultimate piano man!    "And the waitress is practicing politics  As the businessmen slowly get stoned  Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness  But its better than drinkin' alone"|`|apfnKPpRaa	well first learn the piano keys inside and out! then practice with one hand and then with the other seperatly! and it might work like that! it worked for me!|`|ORkve7pzaa	This is solved, for better or worse, by practice. You're always playing different notes with each hand, but it takes practice to play a complex melody instead of just a chord and melody. The best advice for that practice is to take it slowly; no... not over time, I mean move very slowly at first. Move comically slowly, but VERY accurately according to sheet music that is giving you the problems. Speed up once you can get through the piece (or a segment) at "snail" speed, but do NOT sacrifice precision. If you do this for a few pieces, you'll find it comes easier each time.|`|PRCfCSDxaa	Practice all of the scales as much as possible until you can actually start playing with both hands at different rhythms. You could also just get on YouTube and type in "Piano Lessons" and I'm sure you will find something that will help you. If you don't get any help, then go search for a piano teacher.

Death to Lil Wayne line- "I don't kiss my dad I dont get my lil wayne on"    The whole song Ameisha is about how Wayne is a phoney and how he became a punchline rapper.     I think Lil Wayne fears emcees who diss him, he never responds.|`|nFiv4hXzaa	Because Lil wayne is scary and will shoot you if you talk to him!|`|KoNHUcNUaa	Because they're scared of their reputation for jumping on a track with Wayne. Seriously if i hear that a respectable MC get's on a track with Wayne and brags about how he killed him on a track, that would be a wack move because  that would be like beating up a little kid.    But if any mc is scared of wayne, they're not even worthy of the Title "MC".|`|bd1fcb5d764c68e35c6336cba1138542aa	I'm pretty sure I've answered this question before.

I was a big fan of the Motor City Madman from about '77-'80 but cooled off after that. I still like the earlier albums, though (Tooth, Fang & Claw & the mid-70's Amboy Dukes albums, then Ted Nugent (the Epic debut from '75) through Double Live Gonzo).  Songs:  Just What the Doctor Ordered  Stranglehold  Queen of the Forest   Snakeskin Cowboys  Free-For-All  Street Rats  Live It Up  Out of Control  Gonzo! (from Double Live Gonzo; we covered that song in my first rock band. A good Rob Grange bass line too!)|`|N4FdoHhBaa	Free-for-All (1976)  Cat Scratch Fever (1977)  Double Live Gonzo! - LIVE (1978)  Those 3 are the best but I like them all.

My favorite song is Fred Bear,amazing song, I also love Stranglehold.|`|ME4XWNmRaa	I love Cat Scratch Fever and Double Live Gonzo the best. Cat Scratch Fever still blows me away when i hear it and so does Little Miss Dangerous, but his best to me was Fred Bear which was dedicated to his father.

EhLYiIZ2aa	On the whole, Taurus and Pisces get along quite amiably. For me, I have my share of Pisces partners, and I find them rather easy to work with, sweet, and rather intellectual. The Fishes are a cool bunch of people!|`|rXl4VLMJaa	Every Taurus i have met i have became immediate friends with. I love them as much as they love me! Its true they get along very well. Earth and Water are a pretty good pair after all. Pisces and Taurus are a good match in almost anything whether it be love, friendship, business...they make good companions. Taurus people are awesome! they are so down to earth and honest. I haven't met one i had problems with! I cant even get mad at them. =]|`|8bNaX89Daa	AJS,               There are many, many things that could be said about this question. But consider this.              Picture yourself before being born in a human body, your soul personality. Imagine looking below you and seeing the Earth from above in the heavens. Now, picture out in space 12 rings that surround the planet Earth. These 12 rings represent different signs in the Western Zodiac, you are already familiar with what they are.              Each of the 12 astrological signs are said to govern a given set of skills or personality traits, that a soul would posses when they passed through these metaphysical rings on their way down to earth to be born and live out their lives. With that being said, here is where websites, books and popular sources for writing horoscopes go wrong....              It is commonly though that you AJS, are born under a certain sign and that AJS will behave in a manner dictated by the sign you were born through. Many of the horoscope writers out there just assume this is what everyone thinks or, that this is a fact which it is not.              Example: John Doe is a Capricorn, his sign is known as, the "House of Business" (or being sturdy and secure individuals). Does that mean that most of his decisions are business related and that he is more likely to meet with success in business? Is John the kid with the lemonade stand?            Example: Jane Doe is Gemini, her sign is known as the, "House of Knowledge"(Very social, highly energetic, jack of all trades and master of None). Now does that mean that Jane Doe is more than likely to not be successful in business? Certainly not.              All of us are capable of behaving similar and having friends of other signs that "do not" fit their astrological profile. Passing through 1 of the 12 sings in the zodiac only really means that you will go about things as a "whole", you will behave in life possibly more so like what your sign says than someone of the other sign...simply put...              John Doe will be a millionaire because it was in his nature to crunch numbers.            Jane Doe will be a millionaire because she was able to socially network and build on her natural skill set.               Do you see? So the answer to your question is that both sings will get along just as fine as any other match up. Why? These signs only really seem to describe the way each person will behave in any given relationship. You may be excitable and out going or whatever your sign may say as a whole, but this other person may get along fine as well but be more reflective and introverted.               Horoscopes have their place and time and can be useful, but you already have the key to know more about yourself than any horoscope will tell. Really you do...               Regards AJS,               Lucien

MzFqvXu7aa	You can ring ticket master when tickets go on sale, but you want to do it quickly tickets sell fast unless you want seats way in the back.  I went to a Jonas concert and it's defiantly worth it, there was loads of screaming but that's what made it so much fun.|`|zVJMMhcOaa	were ever you live there should be a ticket master there and if you really really want to go to it then some one will be there selling them but maybe a little more than ticket master|`|8R7MYIzzaa	the jonas brothers have some allright music i guess :)|`|k39bNUgeaa	The jonas brothers suck    Of course its a waste of money|`|Fyt9JxTqaa	Jonas Brothers are a complete waste of time.    You'll regret buying the tickets when you get to the concert.|`|spFivilpaa	my friends went one time and they told me it was sickkk  I believe them these guys r so popular right now but Im not sure how they got their tickets. Ticketmaster is prty safe from what I know|`|AA10916001	The ONLY time that the fans yelled so loud you could not hear was in the studio when The Beatles played for the first time on Ed Sullivan. This is a well-known fact to real music buffs/experts.       The Jonas Brothers are hardly in the same league as The Beatles, dear. I know you think they are (I thought Duran Duran was at your age, can you imagine?) but they really are not. In 25 years you will understand what I mean.    Check the Ticketmaster website.....in most larger cities they have walk-up outlets.|`|cUT7n5gOaa	Hahahaha! You're never gonna get your tickets! Hahaha!
hdlZvSIFaa	i think there are elements of both bands that he wouldve liked. the raconteurs have more of a raw sound, kind of grungy. and silversun pickups are more mellow.. but if i would take a guess it would be the raconteurs.|`|7qt4aQGYaa	both, he actually liked all music

COB and LOG r badd@$$ too.   You can overlook the emos, and they won't be anywhere near the pit.....|`|WD9vYTTmaa	Just for Lamb of God alone, I'd pay to go...haha      :)|`|CsWwecBLaa	Yeah, I suppose it's worth it.|`|2V1Kr5laaa	Yeah I'm getting tickets to the Toronto show, I would think its worth it.. LoG is good and Bodom delivers (I like them, I know alot of people don't..)    I agree about AILD attracting the emo kids though lol- just go buy drinks during their set, that's what I'm doing ahah    I think you should definitely go.. (Plus, tickets are 42$ here lol)|`|PkQ06E2Qaa	I'm going to that show in May!  So, I guess it's worth the money for me..  Lamb of god is like my favorite band, and I've seen Children of Bodom twice, and they're amazing live.  The others are alright, I'm not that into As I Lay Dying either, so a third of the people there will probably suck, like you said, but I think it's still worth it!|`|ebxwADDcaa	not really...    same tour is coming to stl...im going and paying that kinda money.    then again most concerts i go to tickets are like 65-70 bucks|`|Hkoc8A4Jaa	Definitely.|`|u0qHDTvtaa	that depends on if u like that type of music. im not personnally, but i assure you if i was, it would definitely be worth it|`|ne93omppaa	That is DEFINITELY worth 38 dollars (to me at least)... if your into this kind of music then you'll love it|`|k7jGZydJaa	If you like those bands, sure, go. 38$ is pretty cheap.|`|ad3M8wViaa	If you really like all those bands, go for it. Its not that much anyway.|`|pWeSEbhVaa	definately go man|`|OpjdM15naa	Dude Im going to that tour it is completly worth it do it at all costs|`|AA12093934	Yes!!! I love Children of Bodon and Lamb of God so that is a really good concert and a good price for 5 bands     =)|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	$38 is a good price but you have to decide if it's worth it to you right now.  Things are tight money-wise all over.  And even though the tickets are cheap, do you have to pay to park, eat, etc.?    I love concerts and used to pay a lot of money to see them.  I used to actually have money (how long ago was that exactly, hmm?)  Was happy to do it because it brought me good feelings and memories for a long time after.      But you could buy some good music with that money too!|`|12QJ9QMRaa	I would say yes, and I am not even that big a gan of any of those bands.    I paid 35 bucks just to see Iron Maiden last June, and 65 bucks For Metallica (with the Sword.  Down sucked so bad I almost wanted a refund)    But for LoG, Municipal Waste and CoB alone I would say yes.  THough for a Laiho show I would rather see Sinergy, but that is jsut me.    I know the worry about emos... even at Maiden I was shocked to see the number of fruitloops out there whering their kid sisters jeans.  Where does that ever sound liek a cool idea, really?    Heck.. I admit though, I am also a concert Whore, and am pretty much willing to shell out anything in reason to see the bands I like live.    I am seeing both Ensiferuma and Lacuns Coils shows this spring and I am sure neither will be cheap.      ***Hey Adam!!   You hiding or something??? Answer my blasted Q you fruit! *grumbles*|`|ox4MdqcVaa	$38 is cheap for a concert with that many bands. Your average concert is way more. Go!! :P|`|sz1YqwUEaa	Yes.|`|OXvH2CgLaa	That lineup is totally worth the price! DO IT! DO IT! DO IT!|`|DbtS5jzEaa	wowie EPCI concert|`|Ew7hXGFtaa	I would definitely go if I was you. I'm hoping that tour comes around here so I can see it myself.    By the way, I respectfully disagree with your As I Lay Dying being emo statement. I love them and I don't think I'm emo at all.

12QJ9QMRaa	Mad Season.      Much as I like SOundgarden, Hungerstrike was really the only god track they put out IMO.    Of course...am I the only person who finds the title "supergroups" to be kinda misleading.  It like you expect with all those All-Star player like you should be getting somethin once in a lifetime awesome... and in reality the results are rarely as good as what they make in their primary bands.|`|7fEVNng5aa	Personally, neither group did anything for me, despite liking most of the bands the artists came from.  --------  "Quis custodiet ipsos Rafiki"  "who watches the Rafiki" :)|`|PvlbqhlPaa	Temple of the Dog|`|7qt4aQGYaa	temple of the dog, but a little interesting fact is that Matt cameron is ALSO a former member of soungarden|`|f948d748facdf196074d849ea9c465c4aa	Thats a hard one    I'll go with mad season though.|`|pWeSEbhVaa	in my opinion, mad season by a long shot  i never get tired of hearing "i dont know anything" or "river of deceit"|`|un2xSpRRaa	Mad Season.      Heh heh, nice to see another Watchmen fan, guy above me.|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	Mad Season - definitely....    I love Chris Cornell but Temple of the Dog just didn't do it for me.
yz1jJM8faa	the swords basically made out of shark scales and how he got it not many ppl know mostly because thats how he was made the swords ability is the suck up chakra around him so it alows him to literly cut through their chakra|`|NQ5MYRauaa	Nobody knows, nobody knows, and lastly, nobody knows.  All we know is its abilities, which is to suck chakra, but nobody knows how who what when where why.|`|r7tzJLEPaa	he most likely got it from an actual shark(it's skin) because samahada means and is made outta shark skin, he uses it to suck chakra from opponents    hope this helped :)))

Most one shot are shojo series XD    http://img134.imageshack.us/img134/8830/...    2.) What is the most money you've spent for one item related to anime or manga?    - Probably around $100-$150. On New Year's eve, I bought like 6-12 Shounen Jump Magazine (Weekly and Monthly) and 5-7 different title of manga. D:  - Wait, you mean ONE item eh? If so, then it would probably be $20-30 when I bought VIZBIG Edition of DBZ manga D:    3.) Do you own any cos-play outfits, homemade or store-bought?    - Nope.

How do you decide to commit to a new manga?    - Usually it is based on the theme of the series. Like for example, I start collection Hunter x Hunter because it has Hunter theme which I find unique. Same thing with One Piece which has a pirate theme. Other than that, I pretty much buying any new series that available on the store.    6.) What is your favorite non-anime TV show?    - Honestly, I'm not really anime fan :| There's a lot of TV show that I like. Some of the show that I really like and enjoy watching are  - Prison Break  - Lost  - Heroes  - House  - CSI Las Vegas (not interested on the other two)  - Seinfeld  - Futurama  - Friends  - The Nanny XD  - Urgh, forgot most of the 80's and 90's cartoon and TV Show that I grow up with >__|`|vqg6wpCLaa	1.

I usually buy ten at once...so it's probably way more than that, actually...  3. No, I do not.  4. Sadaharu, from Gintama.  5. I read up about it and if it sounds interesting, I'll read the first couple chapters. If I can't get into it, I do not continue but I usually want to find out what happens.  6.

4JQUUrX1aa	most people listen to music on the radio.. rather than searching for whats really good so no surprise there|`|cGNK9uD5aa	not really because their awesome and theres alot of fans. and it doesent suprise me that miley cyrus is like a millionair bc there are millions of her little fans even though i dislike her and thats life. we move on|`|u0qHDTvtaa	well i really hate that band, so no im not surprised at all. seems like the music i tend to hate gets really popular|`|un2xSpRRaa	Psh, they have Watchmen to thank for that.|`|gDxMoBl9aa	I'm not surprised at all.|`|5b218420f6e58d52278efc9527f29a95aa	I'm pretty sure MCR and the purchasing of music videos from iTunes appeal to a similar demographic so it's not much of a surprise.|`|k7jGZydJaa	Maybe because the whole thing's not on youtube yet and people are really anxious to see it.    I don't think it's that bad of a cover. It's much better than their other ones, in my opinion.    edit: ohh, it's on youtube now.

AA10289523	Hentai ( or , Hentai?)  listen (helpinfo) is a Japanese word that, in the West, is used when referring to sexually explicit or pornographic comics and animation, particularly Japanese anime, manga and computer games (see Japanese pornography). In Japan it can be used to mean "metamorphosis" or "abnormality". The word "hentai" has a negative connotation to the Japanese and is commonly used to mean "sexually perverted".    In Japanese the word hentai is a kanji compound of  (hen meaning "change" "weird" or "strange") and  (tai meaning "attitude" or "appearance"). The term is used as a shortened form of the phrase  (hentai seiyoku), or "sexual perversion". In slang,  (hentai) is used as an insult meaning roughly "pervert" or "weirdo". The term is not often applied to pornography in Japan. Instead, terms such as 18-kin (18, literally "18-prohibited") meaning "prohibited to those not yet 18 years old", and seijin manga ( "adult manga") are used when referring to pornography. The English letters AV are also used, standing for adult video.|`|EUQrGKj7aa	Hentai is japanese anime porn  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hentai|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Hentei really means pervert. Makes sense if the anime in that category is really perverted.|`|w6Lu2Oesaa	it is japanese cartoon porn. Your brother needs help. I suggest you make fun of him and make his life miserable for looking this up.|`|NQ5MYRauaa	Hentai means 'pervert' in japan, and it's basically porn of the anime variety. Although it doesnt directly /mean/ porn, people use it to refer to anime porn.|`|vmidtcjKaa	Hentai litterally means: perversed. So Hentai are the japanese porn animes.
cvh6u58Daa	It's a fun and catchy tune, really can't help but sing and dance to it. lol. Love Lady Gaga!|`|pSkPC3sbaa	I like it and also,LadyGaGa is one of my favorite singers|`|OOfid3MIaa	Everytime it comes on; I turn up the volume really loud !|`|bmwR7RdMaa	its really catchy.  i am humming that song all day|`|AQxqS7Kyaa	ITS SOOO CATCHY!!|`|Fyt9JxTqaa	I like it. It's pretty catchy :]|`|fVxnoREUaa	I like Poker Face much better.|`|AA10916001	It's OK, I suppose.    Not completely awful, but no great shakes, either.    What musically appeals to a person is entirely subjective and a matter of personal taste.      There is no wrong answer to this question.|`|IpFgrkJAaa	its really good!|`|A48AOfjhaa	OMG I LOVE IT  it's so much funnnnnnn|`|qA4JbDNuaa	i dont really like it but it is my opinion  :]|`|NZ6Xquceaa	I used to love it! but now its just starting to get on my nerves.|`|C8dNhpoKaa	I think it has really bad lyrics but Lady Gaga is so original and exciting that anything she does is really good.

capSLZQXaa	Let It Be(Naked) is more akin to what the Beatles(at least Paul and George) originally wanted in that album. I'm usuallly against artists going back and editting past works(George Lucas and his original Star Wars trilogy), but in this case, Paul more or less removed all the extra "fluff"  from the album. I prefer this to the original. It's not as "overproduced".|`|nYqtw9DWaa	Yeah, I prefer the Naked version to the actual Let it Be.  But I prefer the guitar solo on Let it Be on the regular album.|`|87CAVhs2aa	I haven't heard the 'Naked' version yet actually...  I do love 'Don't Let Me Down.'    But I really like Let It Be the album, I'm sure I'll love both!|`|5eGs0wKPaa	i think remaking anything of the beatles is  a stupid idea...the 1st or original ones will always be the best
jfriQ8pmaa	My favorite is David Vickeroshi, I also love Roxy, they are so funny!!! (both OLTL)  Not a big fan of Erica (AMC) and I'm ready to see Kate (GH) go!|`|O4VrWvoQaa	im an eastenders fan :)|`|yNfZO1I8aa	Well, I think I have two favorite soap opera actors presently.    Firstly, Van Hansis (Luke, As the World Turns) is my favorite soap actor. He is just amazing with every line he says, and his acting continues to surprise me. He has the most potential of all the young men in the daytime, and he has been a fantastic advocate for gay rights. Second, I would have to say that Marnie Schulenberg (Ali, ATWT) is presently my favorite soap opera actress. She just works so well with everyone and I never get tired of watching her!    My least favorite soap opera actor is 100% Roger Howarth (Paul, ATWT). I am not a fan of Paul at all, and that is probably the reason why I can't stand him, but at times I feel that he is lacking in his acting skill.|`|LO3BMobRaa	It's a tie between Y&R's: Victor Newman & Y&R / B&B's: Sheila Carter    Least Favorites: that's a tie between Y&R's Jack Abbott & Phyllis Summers-Romallotti-Abbott-Newman.|`|AA11109728	The only soap I really keep up on is GH.  I love Jason Morgan (played by Steve Burton) and I can't stand Scott Baldwin.|`|d93dbb2143e07e022e1957b6ef08105caa	Best soap actor ever in my opinion is Tristan Rogers, aka Robert Scorpio on General Hospital. He was just too good for TV, a shame because it isn't the same without him.     And the worst? Amber Tamblyn who played Emily Quartemaine on GH before moving on to bigger TV success. I can't believe they gave that girl her own show. Worst, most boring, annoying actress ever. And the one who replaced her as Emily (Natalia Livingstone) is not much better. *yawn* puhlease.|`|36g9KpE4aa	I would have to say Bianca on All My Children is the worst she is ugly and annoying  My favorite is Maxi Jones on General Hospital  Hottest dude would have to be Lucky Spencer from GH|`|oTV3Bro5aa	BEST: Theresa from Passions  WORST: Lucus from Days of our Lives|`|ow1m3c8jaa	Christian Le' Blanc, Michael on The Young and the Restless is my absolute favorite.    My least favorite is the actress that plays Sheilah Carter, can't stand the actress or the character!|`|AA10437764	Jason morgan is the best and worse is well todd manning|`|AA12245937	My favorite soap actor is Tony Geary who plays Luke Spencer on General Hospital.

gJhwH335aa	Err.. Super man is from DC not Marvel. ^__^ Anyway, I get your point.    I prefer manga over comics. I won't go into details like which one has better art and which one has better plot and storyline because to me, each have its pros and cons and its not good to criticize others people work.    I prefer manga mainly because it is easier to start a collection of manga compared to comic books. Unlike comic, manga will sooner or later comes to an end. While there's never ending chain whenever you decided to start a collection of a comic books. Comics has way too many version, edition alternate universe, stuff like that. One particular title might have 10 different artist. Which is why I usually buy a graphic novel instead of ongoing title.    I also like any form or medium of comics from Hong Kong, Korea and my local comics. However, I won't go any details on it since your Q's is more into Manga vs US comics.|`|vqg6wpCLaa	Manga is better for me because I find that it lets me learn more about the Japanese culture and such. Also, manga tends to have better plots and stories, more variety, not always being the same thing unlike many comics. Comics aren't that original to me since I've seen too many that are similar and since they're usually American or Canadian or whatever, I don't learn anything of interest. Just my opinion.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	I love manga the most    There's all kinds of artstyles that I like. So, I welcome all kinds.|`|NQ5MYRauaa	Manga is, regardless of what anyone says, kind of better not counting opinions. I mean, in mangas characters have far more personalities and comics are just like mindless battles over and over. Although they do have manga like that, there are so many mangas that have great stories unrelated to battle.|`|EUQrGKj7aa	i like manga better it has much more varaities|`|bdDxeflZaa	I like both, but my preference is for comics. Mangas all look very similar to me. Comics at least can vary a bit more in drawing style.
rp6EEjECaa	I'm definitely backing Nas on this one 110%. Most news networks (if not all) are biased somewhat but Fox News is WAY more biased than the other news stations. You would have to be an idiot not to see the right-wing bias in Fox News and on top of that they're complete racists! Any network which allows Bill O'Reilly to speak openly and to have his own segment is obviously a racist one. I think that Snoop Doog said it best when he said: "F*ck Bill O'Reilly". My thoughts exactly, Nas definetely knows what he's talking about when it comes to racist news network Fox. "Sly Fox" has got Fox News's racism and biased revealed to the public. Too bad it doesn't get any radio play so only some of us know the truth=( Still, it's an ill track and Nas knows what he's saying here. "Sly Fox" is a hot track but I think that Nas needs to send another ether out to O'Reilly and personally expose that racist pig!|`|lcIOB3mzaa	NAS has a big *** he eats pitbulls GRASS|`|AKwebzdUaa	I notice on the O'Reilly Factor that when ever a guest begins to tell O'Reilly off, they cut to commercials.    Also O Reilly blames americas problems on hip hop and african americans and he blames drunk driving on illegal immigrants and other latinos. I saw the interviews on youtube.    I've also heard Fox News anchors spew out racial slurs, comments, and crack ethnic jokes right on television.|`|spFivilpaa	might b true, theres so much crap we have now that has toxins its amazing. Just recently, some baby toys (pacifiers) were taken off the market and banned for having harnful substances (neural toxins)|`|vFj2GMP4aa	Yo Nas is whack.  Listen to Pac, a real poet.    LOL.

PGXMGlxGaa	I agree with 'The Last Shout'. But if I had to choose another, I would say 'Hospital' from series 2, if only for the dream sequence with Lady Penelope.|`|6vsSSXvfaa	Poor...    soo funny..  love the bit where the have to go to the supermarket ,     Milk?  Milk? where would I get that..      and when they get pulled over by coppers!!    Love every episode though its so hard choosing just 1..

So out of frustration and curiosity, I checked it out at work one day.    The rest is history.|`|3e6758fcfd02678034cc2b0ff260959eaa	i noticed a link to it on a yahoo page as i opened my email, so i looked out of curiosity and spotted the R&P and Movies sections... so i got stuck in ;)|`|C7YbYUYPaa	Just kind of stumbled upon it one day.  I think I accidentally clicked answers instead of mail, and been here ever since.|`|V1hxvQukaa	lol.     i was hanging out at my friends house and she was checking her email and then she came on here. i thought it was awesome, so i made my own account =]|`|WHcBV7rLaa	I was googling a question I had. I don't remember what it was though|`|YaXO6crXaa	lol    I can't remember... I think a friend of mine told me to join WikiAnswers or something, and I ended up joining Y!A.|`|un2xSpRRaa	Everything I Googled led to this.|`|2i6TPlauaa	My sister|`|BZ1uvtsKaa	I googled something and Y!A came up|`|7fEVNng5aa	I don't remember exactly what brought me here. I know it was through the Religion and Spirituality quagmire. I stayed there for a day or so and almost gave up due to the stupidity and hatred there.

And i was on my computer for the whole day...and i think i googled something, some kinda question...and found Y!A and R&P! I hung around a few other sections but R&P mainly, then i decided to stay here the whole time!!  I like it 'cause it does feel like a community and its really cool knowing people on here and stuff =]|`|sz1YqwUEaa	It kept helping me answer homework when I googled things than i figured out their was a Rock and Pop Section so I made an account|`|RtG5Iarbaa	I was bored one day, so I googled something about.. something. I don't remember. And I came here a number of times before finally making an account, which I am glad I did. Though it wasn't till almost a year or, at least a few months later I found R&P. I liked being here most cause I liked talking about music more than just hanging out in a random section for a few minutes until a good question came along. And I liked how everyone here was a community, like with regs and stuff. When I see them in other sections it makes me feel better. xD|`|capSLZQXaa	I Googled "Migraine Headache Cures" a couple of years back, and somehow ended up here. I just starting answering questions here recently though.|`|DibFrwxlaa	I forget, I came into it through the baseball section.  I think I just noticed that sometimes this thing called Yahoo Answers came up when I typed baseball related subjects into Google.  And I then I saw that, like everything else on the internet these days, you needed an account to actually do anything.    It's weird, now you can type questions into google and one of these Q&A sites pops up.
FsVZCk0laa	Les Stroud.  It's more realistic.  Whereas Bear Grylls makes stupid mistakes, Les Stroud attempts to show you what to do if you're ever in a situation where you need to survive.  The one episode I've seen of Man vs. Wild, he was in some desert. He made the mistake of sticking his whole body in a bee(?) hive to recieve honey. (Which, he undoubtly failed, and got stung. Which later turns out he was allergic to bee's, or whatever inhabbited the hive.)    And also, Les Stroud is by himself. There is no camera crew to support him if something DOES go wrong. Whereas Bear Grylls has the support of a full camera crew.|`|ye6Buzneaa	Les Stroud all the way. He actually does survive and is not a fake.|`|TV2QXBbQaa	Bear Grylls all the way|`|eLqh0sMKaa	BEAR GRYLLS!!!  HE is WAYYYYY koolerrrrrrr...... ;)

O9ymY67iaa	I remember it well me and my late mum would watch it on an old B&W valve telly about 1959 ish, both  too terrified to go to the toilet  Quatermass and the Pit is simply the best thing the BBC ever made. It justifies licence fees to this day.   Remember  "We are the Martians now" still scares me.                                      (good question)|`|WaI693jHaa	I remember it well.   Scared all of us kids and my oldest brother still talks about it. All the special effects nowadays can't make films more scary, in fact they tend to make things less scary.    I loved all the Hammer horror films. Brilliant.

76740ad28a40658e6b40499a8b2cb447aa	I'd like to hear you do non-Broadway songs that still have the kind of Broadway feel, like the same big powerhouse vocals but with more modern/mainstream music. Some suggestions for your voice would be "At Last" by Etta James, "Alone" by Heart, "Power Of Love" by Celine Dion", "I Will Always Love You" by Whitney Houston, "Total Eclipse Of The Heart" by Bonnie Tyler, Cyndi Lauper's version of "I Drove All Night", and maybe one of Christina Aguilera's less boring :p songs like "The Voice Within" or "Fighter". You could also try something by Queen, like "Bohemian Rhapsody", "The Show Must Go On", "Who Wants To Live Forever", or something of that nature.|`|Ws9GSAciaa	Eh, I mean your good, but you have the voice of a Broadway person. Stick with what you're really good at. :)|`|676fffa1d033bd7fc45c4eae89d1f268aa	very good would be nice if you pick a better room to sing in

AA10262086	These guys are right. It's a team effort and everybody has to do their part. One thing I can tell you though is that there are a lot of good bands that don't have great lead players but there are very few good bands that don't have a really good rhythm player. One example I can give you is ''The Who''. Like them or not they are legendary. And if you listen too much of their music you will notice that Pete Townsend plays very little lead guitar. When he does it's usually nothing too complicated or exciting. But as far as rhythm guitar goes he's one of the best. An opposite example would be B.B. King. B.B. plays great blues lead guitar but almost no rhythm. But then again he's always got an excellent rhythm guitar player or two in his band. Which is cooler is just a matter of opinion but you can get by without a good lead guitarist if you have to but that rhythm has pretty much got to be there.|`|bZud91iuaa	If you want a successful band each of you will find your place in the band according to your particular talent. Lead guitar gets to stand out on the stage and take the front.  Rhythm holds the song together and if you're better looking than the lead player, then you score more often than he does.  A solid band will learn each others parts and support each other, otherwise you're just 4 or 5 guys jamming.  Chemistry dude.  Learn to play lead too so you can overlay and double the lead. Listen to the Eagles double lead work,     Hope this helped|`|iqVDRH1laa	Lead because of the awesome solo's.|`|o9XAcB4Taa	Shouldn't matter to you because it depends on how everybody sounds together, if you compete against each other to be the coolest, the band will not work as you try to out do each other. So it doesn't matter if you look cool if you sound sh*t.

They may not be better but they're up there, you have to admit he IS lyrically talented. But I think that Go DJ tops Fireman and Hustler Muzik, that track is awesome! Then there's Sky's the Limit, another classic Wayne song. Oh, and don't forget there's *****, Money, Weed. If you haven't heard that that song yet then check it out, that is one sweet song!    I think that Carter 2 is better than 3 but Carter 3 still has a lot of merit to it. I'm not feeling all that R&B stuff that Wayne is pulling like Lollipop or Mrs. Officer but tracks like A Milli and Got Money are still hot, even though they don't match up to his older stuff.
ihVd8EbJaa	Its very real. With today's shop till you drop attitude, things really pile up fast if you don't have anywhere to put them. I have a shed that a lot of things are ending up in from nearly 20 years of accumulation. I don't really want to get rid of possessions in case "I need them someday." Unless you're really good about getting rid of an item every time you bring something new into the house, then its going to add up, and fast. We like to have things and keep things, a lot of times for the memories but also because people think there will be hard times down the road and think it would be best to have things on hand if it does. I personally don't ever want it to get so bad that I can't even walk through my own house, but I have seen it. So yes, some people can't let go of all their stuff and they they just don't know what to do with it all and it ends up looking like it does on Clean House, but I still like my messy friends anyway.........  : )|`|T9DxKOCjaa	doubt it why would they bother|`|WGsC4c61aa	Some of the houses are so unbelievable to me. I know that maybe I don't know anybody to that extreme but I could not go into a house that looks like that. How can you move around or don't they? Is like the episodes on cops where they go to cracks houses, maybe.

d20feb0d03f94b65cc82fb1a12566011aa	I consider Zeitgeist to be an intellectually dishonest documentary, not because of the filmmakers personal bias, but because of its disregard for the truth. There is so much questionable statements that can easily be refuted, or controversial points that have legitimate opposing views that should have been presented.    - Regarding part 1: Jesus    The "Mythology of Jesus" theory was an obscure and generally dismissed theory.   It has gained exposure due to author "Acharya S" and her collaboration with the Zeitgeist filmmaker. (She is also author of the films companion guide). But even the casual but astute viewer will find considerable silliness in the some of the conjectures where practically any numerical or astrological connection 'proves' mytholical derision. Son=sun? Three stars in Orions belt = three kings? Virgo = Mary because the astrological sign sort of looks like an M? Who buys this stuff?    Some other views:    " The idea of Jesus as a myth is rejected by the majority of biblical scholars and historians. In 2004, Richard Burridge and Graham Gould stated that they did not know of any "respectable" scholars that held the view today. Robert E. Van Voorst has stated that biblical scholars and historians regard the thesis as "effectively refuted"."    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_myth_...    For a point-by-point analysis, see http://www.conspiracyscience.com/article...    For more rebuttals, see http://webskeptic.wikidot.com/zeitgeist-...      - Regarding Part II: 9/11    It should be noted upfront that being skeptical of the 'official version' of anything presented by the government or media, is a good thing for society. And it should also be noted that questioners of 9/11 'offical versions' range from genuine intellectual pursuits of greater truths, to bizarre interpretations specifically intended to support a unwavering point of view.     The Zeitgeist filmmaker is part of that spectrum that has bought into the theory that the government orchestrated the whole thing. Unfortunately the evidence they selected and presented was sloppy and much of it easily disproved, even by members of the Truth movement. (I've heard some speculate this may have been a red-herring to discredit the 'truth' movement).    For a point by point analysis, see http://www.conspiracyscience.com/article...        - Regarding Part III: Men behind the curtain    As a liberatarian, I found this part to have had the most potential in exposing abuses of government and men in power. Instead, it trots out tired long disproven conspiracy theories.     "Income Tax law Doesn't exist" theory - Very stale. Consistently disproven over-and-over again. No new information, just new victims going to jail that fall for these arguments. Very sad.     "Federal Reserve System is owned by international bankers" - Still a common conspiracy theory. Still wrong. The Federal Reserve System, is headed by the Board of Governors, a Government Agency (look it up - http://www.whitehouse.gov/government/ind... ). The Federal Reserve branches can definitely be considered tightly regulated corporations owned by their member banks, all of which must be American-owned by law. It is receives regular audits, and is overseen by congress.     For a point-by-point analysis, check out:  http://webskeptic.wikidot.com/zeitgeist-...  http://webskeptic.wikidot.com/zeitgeist-...  http://webskeptic.wikidot.com/zeitgeist-...    Other views:    "There is no shortage of information which refutes this viewpoint. But this type of conspiracy relies on two elements common to web surfers: First, they're only willing to check facts at the most superficial level, which usually means they'll read a message or watch a clip just once before forming an opinion and moving on. " Ref:   http://media.wildcat.arizona.edu/media/s...    "...(a) common problem in the film: presenting something in such a shallow manner without further corroboration or scholarly evidence." - Ref:   http://gauntlet.ucalgary.ca/story/12284    There are those who defend the film because they believe that agenda+motive is more important than truth. There is a certain irony here since the films overarching thesis is to be wary of those who would obfuscate the truth in an attempt to persuade others to their point of view.|`|bvZHEAwLaa	It is very educational and it will be good for all people to see it.
MwSaCettaa	He's gotta do something old!!    10th Avenue Freeze Out would be my pick!!    ???|`|VXcp8hvHaa	hopefully he will have a sore throat and not, I personally can't stand him.

He doesn't really have enough time to play one long song, or else his show would only get 3 songs! I've noticed that Super Bowls tend to do quicker/regular songs, so they can change the fancy lighting and use new guitars. When Prince did his performance, I swear he had 10 guitars!|`|pjKZQotYaa	Something from his new album, probably Working on a Dream and the oldie, Born to Run would be my guesses.  Then, again, the Boss is always one for surprises!
0FUWmpZ5aa	eh i don't think they should make a new one but if so i would for a no name actor. why? well it would make it better looking.|`|1e6eca30bdd2eb772df216bfd70b9ca4aa	Alright, this is my opinion....so please try to hear me out and not delete my answer.    You think Megan Fox is skanky, and you think "Angie" is not? The same Angelina Jolie who homewrecked a married couple. Pitt and Aniston were still married when "Angie" started getting excited about working every day with Brad on the set of Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Not only that, but she was making out with Billy Bob thornton on the red carpet when he declared they had just "f**ked" in the car. Yeah, real classy. That's when she still had that billy bob tattoo on her arm.    As far as I know, Megan Fox hasn't done any of that kind of crap. She also hasn't adopted 10 kids and had 10 others. So im guessin she's in better shape to do whatever kind of role she wants.

If you want to be famous you have to put in a LOT of work. Advertise in papers, on the internet, on websites and forums - put yourself out there as a singer for studio work or for a band. The more people you get to know in the business the better. Record some songs you've written and make a CD, then send it to local newspapers, magazines and radio stations to see if they'll play it for you. As well as that you'll have to work on your image BIG time as well as your music itself so that you stand out among the countless other wannabe singers. Get in a band, even if it's the worst band in the world and start gigging to get yourself, your name and your image out there. Also consider using a stage name if your name is a bit unglamorous Finally, get yourself a manager or PA to handle all press work, gigs, appearances etc.|`|C568eIL7aa	well there are a lot of ways to become famous  become a fashion model  singer   actor or actress   athlete    but since u think u can sing, try participating in local singing compitions or functions. record your singing and post it on youtube, my space or blogs etc.  american idol is a long road for the beginners but im sure u can do it if u try hard   best of luck!!!!!!|`|ipdM8Sefaa	becoming 'famous' is near on impossible, be happy with yourself and don't strive for it because you don't want to be let down.  but after saying that, try going for competitions, record in a studio, go on youtube or try x-factor... if your brave enough :)  cause you never know you could be that lucky one that makes it... with enough ambition.

Ever heard of YouTube? It's an entertainment site where people post videos for others to watch. And YOU can be famous there. Anyone can! So if you want to, read on... for examples go to www.youtube.com/YourNameHere    Creative Corporate Video  Orange County, Los Angeles 14 yrs Excellent Cost & High Quality  www.visionsoundcomm.com Video 3d  Find & share free 3D models - Free 3D modeling software  www.3dvia.com Japan Shiatsu Clinic  Located in Vancouver NorthVancouver Richmond Burnaby Nanaimo BC Canada  www.shiatsu.vc       Hide these ads    Show Ads   [edit] StepsMake A Few Videos. This includes getting a video camera, recording, editing, and uploading. You need a few good videos already on your profile, and you'll see why later on in this article. So make something to watch, maybe about ten videos over the course of a while, maybe a month, so you actually get your own show going. It is not going to be well-known, but this is the first step. If you choose an alternative, go to the next step.   Animation. Animation is quite useful (if you don't want to expose yourself to the whole world) but requires some software: Pivot Stickfigure Animator, Hypercam (records what's on your screen) and Windows Movie Maker (to add sounds, cause Pivot can't). Or if you have a Mac, iMovie HD is a great program to use.   Make Your Money Video. Make one more video, a good one, or a mediocre one. In it, and you'll see why, say things like, "I know this is unlike my OTHER videos." or "You guys have been asking about_____." or even "Hey guys its me again thanks for your great comments." Now, how is this different from your other videos? You're still going to get maybe 7 views if you're lucky, right? No, read on.   Post this video...As a Response Video . Find someone who is ALREADY famous on YouTube or even someone who is obviously going to be on top one day. You can certainly find videos with a lot of views and not too many video responses. Now, by posting this video as a response to a famous person's video, or to a famous video, more people will watch your video (a surprisingly large amount, maybe 1/5 of the people watching the original video). People will notice how you mentioned your other videos, and your "fans" and such, and they will pay a visit to your page. "Hey! A lot of videos! Cool! Hey they are not too bad! I will subscribe! Yeah!" There you go. Just sit and watch; subscribers will get higher and higher within weeks.   Keep Them Entertained. Make more videos. Do it. Post more responses, make more originals. Be sure to make your page look good.   Market Yourself. Spread the word by posting videos of your talent on as many nice sites as you can.         [edit] TipsMake sure the video is about something worth watching. Don't think you're going to get famous from some nonsense you filmed yourself doing. You're only going to make a fool of yourself to the whole world, and sometimes you only get one chance to give yourself fame. Thus, you will be lucky if you mess up, then get a second chance afterward. So think carefully about what you're doing!   YouTube from now on allows at maximum ten minutes per video. But this doesn't mean you video has to be ten minutes long. If your video is longer than ten minutes in length, count the duration via minutes and divide that by ten and that's how many videos you'll be posting on YouTube. For example, you can post a four hour movie on YouTube. If you do, divide 240 (minutes) by 10, you will have to post twenty-four videos on YouTube to fit your four hour video.   Please note that you MUST have a profile before sending any videos to this website. If you don't have one, just get one. It's quick and easy...and it's free! What have you got to lose?   In the middle of every video, YouTube takes a snapshot and uses that picture as a preview. It's called a video tag. Now, you should TRY and make your tag look entertaining. I'm not saying that you should put a picture of a hot girl in the middle of your video, but look your best throughout, and make sure you look interesting the whole way through. It's sad how people judge a video by its preview. But hey, you have to accommodate.   You may choose to use a YouTube friend adder like Tubeinator to jumpstart the views on your channel as well.   Another thing you can do is find someone who isn't famous that much on youtube but has a fair amount of subscribers. Compliment their videos under their comments and say that you will subscribe to them if they subscribe to you.         [edit] WarningsIf you're under eighteen and doing this, be aware of the potential pedophiles, watching you, trying to get at you. Chances are, even if you are over 18, people may still hunt you down. Nevertheless, note this potential danger, and the potential stalkers out there.   Do not post anything on YouTube yo|`|U09HLa7Paa	There are no websites that I know of like that, that will make you famous.

qydcoAbFaa	Eagle Eye - Action  Pineapple Express-Comedy  Igor-Computer Animated|`|fNpFlP2Baa	For comedy, I would say... Get Smart.  It's a fairly new movie, and it's also hilarious.  You would love it.    For adventure... Dark Knight... You probably saw it, but it's still a great movie and good on DVD.    For animated... Definately Wall-E.  This movie was probably the best movie I've ever seen in a long time.  Even though it looks like it's more for younger children, I would highly suggest it for all ages.      Hope that helps :)|`|6r6RvHAWaa	Well Death Race was awesome. If you dont like that then you could check out city of amber or ember. cant remember.

vqg6wpCLaa	Yaoi is smut. Man on man sex. It can be very descriptive and graphic so if you are not mature enough to read it or are not interested in homosexuality, you should not read/watch it.    There is also Slash, which is pretty much the English word for yaoi and is generally used for English based fanfics (e.g. Harry Potter.)    Then, we have shounen-ai or Boys Love (BL) which is pretty much romantic and cute homosexual men and their experiences. Generally more appropriate and is a lot cuter than yaoi, which tends to be rather kinky.    There is also yuri and shoujo-ai which is the same as yaoi and shounen-ai only with women.    EDIT: I forgot to say. Yaoi, yuri, shounen-ai and shoujo-ai are generally used for anime or manga fanfics (well, that's what they are). All Japanese. ^_^

And this is posted in the wrong section.|`|vqg6wpCLaa	Hello.  It seems that you are in the wrong section, but not to worry. You are not the first. You must be new to this, I guess, but everyone is learning that Twilight belongs in Jokes and Riddles, not Comics and Animation. So, please, from now on, post your question in aforementioned category.  To answer your question:  No. Twilight is horrible. Get outside and read a real book and watch a real movie. I won't be joining the fanclub.  Good-bye.|`|CnlSbPsuaa	No,not really, but just because I'm not into vampires that much and it's a story that's been done a lot, but it is very well-written and must be very good for those who like that sort of thing =)|`|cXPVtTUJaa	Yes, I love all of the books and the movie :)!!!|`|kPMxo2MCaa	Nope.

Pink is her worst nightmare...she wears the same black dress every day. She loves math and science. Her best friends are her four BLACK CATS! She's into old rock & punk, but also digs newer bands like My Chemical Romance (BTW, Gerard Way is featured in her Dark Horse comic book, "Revenge at Last!") Emily is so anticool she's cool... a subculture of one, and a follower of no one but herself.      Designers including Jean-Paul Gaultier, Valentino and Marc Jacobs have paid tribute to her, but she doesnt care! Emily wants you to be yourself, think for yourself, and DO IT YOURSELF.

ZwWMGiEPaa	this will spoil it but in the 27th Graphic novel it explains. When kakashi was younger he was doing a mission with his squad (Kakashi, Rin, Obito, and Forth Hokage.) It had been the day Kakashi was announce to be a Jounin. Everyone was suppose to present him with a gift. Obito, an unsuccessful Uchia that hadn't gained the sharingan eyes, had nothing to present to kakashi. In the early part of the mission kakashi loses his left eye gaining the scar he has. Obito later Under pressure used sharingan to protect Rin. At the end of the fight Obito is crushed under a large pile of rocks leaving only the left side of his face to be exposed. He askes Rin, who is a medical ninja to transplant his eye to kakashi becuse thats the only thing he had left. She does and he is thought to have died.|`|SjNpWwSfaa	He's a Copy Ninja :)|`|C3tVKFWuaa	A close friend (Obito Uchiha) gave it to him, when he was dying on a mission. His eye was injured badly and so then Obito gave it to him. Then that is why he has the scar over his sharigan eye also!    Hope i helped!|`|oKyimeaMaa	when he was young, kakashi was on a mission with his team, and one of them, obito, an uchiha, got crushed by a giant boulder trying to save kakashi, and so, with half of his body covered by the boulder, obito gave kakashi his sharingan eye as a gift, because obito didnt give him a gift since kakashi had just become a jounin.........they used a medical ninjutsu to do this from their other team member, Rin........|`|kEjiYLSmaa	he had it ever since His friend gave it to him.. (Spoiler) He also has a new type of sharingun in shippuden as well..|`|cTA6OmjUaa	his friend was of the Uchiha clan and when he died he gave his eye to Kakashi....|`|NQ5MYRauaa	When he was 13 an Uchiha from his team (With a personality/look thats almsot exactly like naruto) died and gave him one of his sharingan eyes. for more info you can read Kakashi Gaiden at http://www.onemanga.com/Naruto/239/01/

ZbEF9KoXaa	it's sort of a duet, but if you can sing that high, yea GO FOR IT!|`|yYAabiSLaa	"Think of me" is not an art song, because it comes from Andrew Lloyd Webber's " The Phantom of the Opera" ( a musical)-- thus making it musical theatre.    An "art song" refers to a vocal composition written primarily for solo voice and accompaniment  ( usually piano). Generally they are operatic in style-- though they DO NOT come from an opera ( or Oratorio/Musical)    Try the works of Schubert, Schumann, Poulenc, Britten... etc    NOTE: The terms "lied" "leider" and  " chanson" all refer to art songs ( in german, and french respectively.)    http://www.recmusic.org/lieder/    This is a great site for browsing the background information of Art songs. ( like, text ad translations, the poet, the composer.. etc)|`|JdkwEhYQaa	I think it is an art song because art requires a lot of diffrent styles and colors and this song has alot of tones and pitches! GO FOR IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
AA12252798	I don't think so. It comes from a musical. I sang it before in a contest called "Jugend musiziert" and if my memory serves me right, it was theatrical/musical.
AleT38EYaa	The 1996 one is the awful movie where Catherine Zeta-Jones got her start as an actress.  The director of "Mask of Zorro" couldn't sleep one night, flipped on the TV, and saw her in the miniseries.  He later said she was "the only one worth saving" from that shipwreck of a miniseries.    It may be that there were similar iconic shots, but the 1997 version was better produced because it was for the bigscreen and thus had a bigger budget.
rXl4VLMJaa	lmao i was a tomboy. When i was little i LOVED sports, especially soccer! i loved to be active and hang out with guys more than girls. I hated makeup, barbie, pink (still do lol), and blond hair (no offense to blondes thats how i was when i was little becuz they were the most feminine girls lol) I grew out of that phase kinda. I dress girly-ish now but my personality hasnt changed much. Everyone still calls me the guys kinda girl, just more feminine now lol.

tnHZbJv2aa	I really want to like it, but I found myself FF'ing through 80% of the "Sacrifice" episode...  I read that the show is supposed to just capture broad events in the books, rather than be a straight adaptation of the books... I think it succeeds in that, but sometimes the events they build a story around are just so boring...    I'll keep watching until they cancel it...

amJLL2nlaa	Taylor Lautner, definitely.  He has better acting skills than Zac Efron..  Efron only performs well when near Vanessa Hudgens. Besides the HSM movies, all else is horrible.  But Taylor Lautner, in Twilight and all his other movies and the recently cancelled 'My Own Worst Enemy' TV show, he's amazing.|`|bmwR7RdMaa	taylor is better than zac|`|Fyt9JxTqaa	Taylor on all of those except who's girly!

6vzpHTqQaa	"Burns Baby Burns"    Rodney Dangerfield guest stars as Mr. Burns' son, Larry. Larry's boorish behavior is a turn-off to his old man and soon, Homer helps Larry fake his own kidnapping as hilarity ensues.    I love this episode because Rodney Dangerfield did what he did best: one-liners:    Woman: Oh, Monty, you must meet our daughter, the debutante. She came out last fall.  Larry: Whoa! Put her back in, she's not done yet!    Dangerfield made this episode work, and I like Journey's "Any Way You Want It" playing at the end of the episode as a little homage to "Caddyshack" (love the song, too).|`|7hNy0ogYaa	i love the simpsons im glad u do 2! but personally i luv the 1 where bart says "eat my shorts" which is all of them!!!! lols!!|`|lbgoHgDkaa	I think it was called "The Springfield Files".  i'm a huge fan of both the simpsons and the x-files.  it was great to see both together in one show
UTP1UBIRaa	I loved the parent trap but I was also a big fan of Escape to witch mountain (can't wait for the new one)!|`|m4PtEEDNaa	...first and foremost, without a doubt, that would be the 1946 classic "Song of the South", which still has yet to see OFFICIAL release on video...in any format (...though bootlegs of the film are quite prevelent, on VHS and DVD)...    ...I am also quite partial to the series of comical 'high school' movies, which actor Kurt Russell did in the late '60's and early '70's, which include "The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes", "Now You See Him, Now You Don't", and "The World's Strongest Man"...    ......a couple of classic Disney adventure films, which are definitely up there amongst my favorites, include "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea" and "In Search of the Castaways"...|`|90fd78b73868ccef71f5925f6a98713aaa	mulan, anastasia, and pocahontas|`|f83f43c581db1234e5bac01ee41c75e1aa	The Lion King!  :D|`|JUQmDeW3aa	I really liked Cinderella and The Little Mermaid because they were both entertaining and of course in the end they lived happily ever after.  :]|`|SG8zJHepaa	Probably Pirates of The Caribbean, i just remembered it was a disney movie!

That's kinda like asking if drums are ever used in hip hop.    Most of the time bass lines are taken from samples of older songs (like "Rapper's Delight" using the bass line of "Good Times" by Chic) but there are a good amount of hip hop artists and producers who compose their own bass lines for songs. The Roots, Organized Noize (who do the beats for Outkast), Cunninlynguists, Stetsasonic, N*E*R*D, are a few that come to mind.|`|oJsrGmmPaa	I know Eminem uses a lot of bass and piano. I think I've heard some bass guitar in Dre's songs too.
AA11578107	When Aries and Taurus come together in a love affair, the partnership is a natural union of Love, represented by Taurus, and Passion, represented by Aries. This relationship is all about balance. Aries wants to jump right in and get into it, while Taurus prefers to go much more slowly. This can create a problem; Taurus loves to be wooed and romanced -- two concepts that are basically foreign to straightforward, brash, totally unsubtle Aries. An Aries-Taurus partnership can be a great learning experience for both Signs. Taurus can help Aries rein in some of the more foolish, impractical impulses, and Aries can help Taurus be more spontaneous and adventurous.|`|a85f51bc1ebf5d87f5dd0aee9e9e7afbaa	well.

rXl4VLMJaa	aries in venus....    "If your Venus is in Aries, you thrive on initiating new relationships, and don't shy from making bold propositions. There's an innocence to your invitations that softens the reserve of more guarded types. Your lust for life is contagious, but not everyone can live at your pace. You guard your independence, and would never do or say anything for the sake of the relationship. Others respect you because you stay true to yourself no matter what."    "In Love and Romance:     As a Venus in Aries person, you have fiery passions that easily inflame around attractive potential lovers. You'll pursue a love interest ardently, and in extreme cases, this zeal leads you into fly-by-night marriages. Your impulsiveness gets you in trouble, because you lose interest just as quickly. You don't like anything too settled, preferring some tension in the relationship. For you, combat gets the blood pumping, including mental sparring. You'll flee from a passive partner, or a bond that has lost its luster. Bottom line is that you need challenge, and constant stimulation."    "Friendship Style:     You like to be the alpha of any clique, and pulls it off by being generous, exciting and just so darn self-assured. You're the one that pushes the experimental envelope, and comes back to share tales of your exploits. You're blunt, which means you won't lie and tell friends they look good all the time. You admire strong, independent types, and seem to get nauseous around self-pity, insecurity, etc. If a friend is nursing an emotional wound, you'll instinctively serve up some tough love. Your honesty makes you trustworthy, since people always know where you stand."    "The Big Attraction:     You earn admiration because of your independence, self-confidence and vitality. You are a lusty person, and that itself is sexually attractive. You have an alive physicality and activity level that gets attention. What makes you irresistible is that you're not talking about doing whatever it is, you're doing it."      "Winning your Heart:     This is a tricky one because any pre-planning will have to be tossed out the window during the wild ride with a Venus in Aries. You want people to be real, and not play games. You want people to be direct and don't say things they don't mean. You like to lead, but crave dynamism in a partner. Your ideal partner is igniting their own passions and staying interested in their own life. You don't want to analyze the relationship, or be expected to read minds."|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	http://www.sexualastrology.com/venusinar...|`|Vpk1nP7gaa	Switched..Venus in Aries  I'm too tired to type...Go Google

LrKCLZF7aa	What orb are you using? I use a three degree orb and only increase it for planetary geometry. I assume here that you are a serious about astrology as I am as I present these interpretations. It's always better to allow us to throw your charts.    His sun conjunct my moon (scorpio)  This is not a truly significant linkage no matter what traditional astrology claims. This linkage is helpful in building mutual understanding and enhances compatibility. Also bestows non-sexual attraction and an affinity toward each other in a subtle manner, making both parties feel reasonably at ease with each other.      His sun conjunct my rising (scorpio)  Mild linkage that is not going to make or break any relationship.    His venus conjunct my mars (scorpio)  This is one of the three Sexual Linkages. Each Sexual Linkage has its own hallmark. The special characteristic of this one is that when you make love together, your bodies are perfectly in synch. You each sense what the other wants and needs without words. For most couples with this linkage, making love is intoxicatingly fluid from the very start all the way through to the usually rapturous wind down. This linkage is equal to the Venus-Pluto linkage as the linkage that is most powerful in actually creating sexual attraction. When the two of you are together, there are times when you literally feel this magnetic attraction. When you are together, your sexual appetites and prowess are at levels that surprise and delight you both. For all these reasons, the sexual ecstasy that is achieved with this linkage is addictive and is often mistaken for love. It is wise to always bear in mind that sex is sex, and love is different and on another level. Only Chiron linkages are signs of love.     His mars conjunct my venus (leo)  Same as the last    Sextile are only semi linkages and the power diminishes. I think he likes you too because of the Mars Venus situation. I'm sure the sex will be great. Have fun.    Jealousy is not good for a relationship and I can see that Scorpio is playing a big part here. Unless there are Chiron aspects I don't think it will last.
hCI6HFEnaa	I absolutely agree with You're Gonna Go Far, Kid on The Jonas Bros.    The biggest are many of the music stars such a Beyonce, Katy Perry, and the popular newcomers like Lady GaGa.    The actors and actresses in their prime and in recent good also seem to be very popular right now like Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie and Anne Hathaway.|`|LRLu1ofNaa	The biggest celebrities are probably Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, Johnny Depp, The Jonas Brothers (=P), and Beyonce.    I don't like any of them. I like Alex Gaskarth, Jack Barakat, Rian Dawson, Zack Merrick, Brandon Flowers, Johnny Knoxville, and Joel McHale.      ?Joe Jonas Accio'd Me?: You know that you are one of the reasons that people can't stand the Jonas Brothers and their fans, right?    edit to ?Joe Jonas Accio'd Me? again: Ok, so you don't care that you are making yourself look like a complete idiot? Typing in all caps, and using only one letter per line? Do you know how annoying that is?!|`|UmAM1cW8aa	I like Johnny Depp!!!!!!|`|AA11297919	David Tennant.  By far.  Most gorgeous man on the planet.

AA10076207	i know that one. it's right after his wife died, and they talk about what might've been if they'd stayed together,and both of them agree that their ship had sailed. "the golden Hynd" i think was the name of it. one of my favourites.|`|Hel4w9uoaa	I believe the episode is Judgement Day where X&G guest star in the Hercules episode.

ab250551cde4aadbf54a0fea8a7b14e1aa	John Wayne dies in seven films (another four--off-screen):   The Deceiver (1931) [Reginald Thorpe's Corpse]: Stabbed to death (off-screen) by Sidney Bracey. (The part was actually played by Ian Keith during the "living" scenes; John only served as a stand-in when the body is discovered.)    Central Airport (1933) [Co-Pilot in Wreck]: Killed when his plane crashes into the ocean.     Reap the Wild Wind (1942) [Captain Jack Stuart]: Killed by a giant squid while deep-sea diving through an old shipwreck.    The Fighting Seabees (Donovan's Army) (1944) [Wedge Donovan]: Shot in the chest by a Japanese soldier while driving his jeep towards an oil refinery tank; the jeep collides with the tank and causes an explosion, so John manages to carry out his mission even in death.    Wake of the Red Witch (1948) [Captain Ralls]: Drowned after being trapped by falling debris while retrieving gold from a sunken ship.     Sands of Iwo Jima (1949) [Sgt. John M. Stryker]: Shot to death by a Japanese soldier while making his way up Mount Suribachi.     The Sea Chase (1955) [Captain Karl Ehrlich]: Presumably drowned (off-screen), along with Lana Turner, after their lifeboat is lost at sea.    The Alamo (1960) [Colonel Davy Crockett]: Killed in an explosion when he sets off the charges, after being stabbed with a lance by a Mexican soldier.     The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962) [Tom Doniphan]: Dies (off-screen) of natural causes. His coffin (but not his body) is shown when James Stewart arrives at the funeral home, and the rest of the movie is a flashback to many years earlier.    The Cowboys (1972) [Wil Andersen]: Shot in the shoulders, back, and stomach by Bruce Dern; he dies shortly after the teenage cowboys carry him back to their camp.     The Shootist (1976) [John Bernard Books]: Mortally wounded by the bartender during a shoot-out in a saloon; he dies shortly after the end of the shoot-out.|`|9b46fa1bcd4de3f2eed9af5a9e409c3eaa	sands of iwo jima  the shootist  the man who shot liberty valance.  the cowboys.  the alamo  wake of the red witch  fighting seabees  reap the wild wind.  the sea chase.

Brad Pitt is only attractive in it for approximately five minutes. The movie is so long and doesn't really get anywhere.    Taken, I have heard good and bad about it. Honestly it looks like it's been done before. We all know the outcome.    New in Town, I don't know anyone who has seen it. It looks pretty funny, if you are looking for more of a comedy then I would go with this one.    Verdict: I would see either Taken or New in Town, but that's just me.|`|m9PwT7eSaa	I saw TAKEN and it was a good movie.  I recommend it b/c its a movie that has things that happen in real life and there's a lesson to be learned after it...  If u go see it  Hope u like it!!!!!!!!!  ~Maylex~

It is episode 8 in the first season.

ea0b5BzBaa	No sexual stuff. But in the beginning Anna and her boyfriend are kissing and he says "I love you, and I have a condom" but she just leaves.    IMO, it's not the age, it's the maturity rate.  I've been seeing pg-13 movies since I was 9 and R movies since I was 11 (the sexual ones, my parents don't know about) :p|`|Oz0h1TXwaa	it shows camel toe  but do not take her to go see my  bloody valentine. it has like this lady  nude for about 5 minutes.|`|c90TJKe4aa	I took my friend and 10 year old cousin to see it he wasn't scared|`|VgRy6jxuaa	I don't know if such a scary movie is appropriate for an 11 yr old.

NC67WVlEaa	Well, as you can probably tell, I'm a Nirvana fan but, I was born in the '90s so I wasn't really alive to experience Nirvana. I do wish that he was still alive making music, though. What's with all the hate on this question? If you don't miss him, you don't have to answer the question and piss people off. The guy was a genius, and I just can't take people seriously who don't at least respect him, a little bit.|`|	yea|`|	he's in hell sucking hitler's cock!   :)|`|niYixDU4aa	uhhh duh.  and pfftttt....heaven?      but i was like a month old when he died.  so can i say i really miss him?  i do wish i was older when he was alive, though.|`|ihnyMbH2aa	who? Is it that dude in z1077?|`|AA10034934	good riddance. he was a drag.|`|	yes. he was such an awesome songwriter!|`|	Nope I don't and he is probably in hell.|`|	not really he was a douchebag|`|	????????????????????????|`|	No.|`|	Me2! Yesterday, I lent my friend a pencil because he told me he would bring Kurt Cobain back. I didn't believe him but i gave him my pencil anyway because of wishful thinking|`|	i hope hes being perpetually raped by satan|`|	Doubt he'd wanna be in  heaven, but I miss his lyrics.|`|	Not really, he wasn't that good|`|	i miss sid vicious    screw kurt cobain|`|	No,and people who  kill themselves dont go to heaven.|`|	No and he's probably in hell right now.|`|	Hell yeah I do, but I doubt he did...|`|	I was only two or three when he died so I can't say I miss him, but I wish I could have been around long enough to experience Nirvana live.  And, really? Do you think a bisexual suicidal cocaine addicted stoner rock star could go to what the Christians call "heaven"? Even if it wasn't a completely foolish invention of mankind, it would be absurd to assume he went there. And I mean that with all due respect (to Cobain)|`|	Hell no!|`|	Were you even alive before he died?|`|	Yeah, I do...I miss his music.  The guy was a songwriting genius...|`|	Of course. He was amazing and screw all the people who don't think so. He was creative and a very nice guy from what I know. Although I didn't know him personally, I wish I did. The only thing we can do now is listen to the gift he gave all his fans, his music.|`|	Personally I don't miss him, but I do think he should have gotten some real help ifor his problems nstead of offing himself.  It's a shame because he left a wife and little daughter at the time.  I wasn't into Nirvana but he could have gone on to bigger and better things.  Suicide should never be viewed as a solution.|`|	NOPE!|`|	Nope|`|	Kurt cobain is a guitar reject that got what h had comin./..|`|	I just hope he's happy whereever he is now.|`|	supose...|`|	Yeah... I'd love to see what his next album sounds like.  Have you heard the song You Know You're Right? it was last song they recorded and never released on an album til the compilation "Nirvana."  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhpdR-vgK...|`|	yes, a lot, he's my idol, but honestly I don't think he went to heaven cus he wasn't a Christian :(|`|	Yes, I do too.

Do that **** do that **** do it   Do that **** do that **** do it   Do that **** do that **** do it   Do that **** do that **** do it   oo yeah   on the dance floor   can you feel me?     Diddy: [Verse 1]   Yeah, yeah, yeah   Let's play a game, let's pretend for a second   You dont know who I am, and what I do   Lets just put it to the side.   I can feel your heart beating, I can hear you breathing   Look into your eyes, tryna see into your mind, see into your soul.   No limits to the levels me and you can go,   When it's me thats in control   But it's something bout you that makes me wanna change   I like the way you dancin, and the way you play the game   I like the way you take away the pain,   The way you tell me that you want it, not sayin a thing   The way you got me going, got me going out of my brain   I see us going at it, going in and out of them lanes   I don't want your innocence, I don't want you to settle,   I don't want a commitment and I don't want you to suffer.   I don't want your number, baby I want you to wonder.   I want you to come up looking like something you want to.     Christina:     Tell me   Whatcha thinking about when you got me waiting patiently   And usually I don't have to wait for nobody.   But there's something about you that really got me feelin weak,   And I'm trying to find the words to speak.     [Bridge]   Boy I got my eyes on you   So tell me what you want to do   I can picture you in my room   Until the morning.   I don't even know your name   Boy I need to know your name   I'm hopin that you feel the same   Tell me if you want it.

(Baby)     Diddy: [Verse 2]   Your dream's fulfilled, you rockin with the best   Unforgivable, I'mma put your limits to the test   Your pulsating, your heart is beating out of your chest   Your hyperventilating, you tryna catch your breath (Don't stop)   I'm the first, I'm the next, I'm the end   I'm the force in your thoughts that will make your mind bend.   Look how I approached you, look how I exposed you   The -- every move, now I know you   I dont want to control you, I want to console you   And do everything that I told you   Get high with me, come touch the sky with me   Fly with me, see life in new eyes with me. (Don't stop)   I'm the dream, I'm the one, I'm the reason you come   I'm a king, I'm a hoe, I'm a beast (I'm a beast)   I'm the last thing in your eyes   See the passions inside me, and yours never cry me.     Christina:   Tell me, whatcha thinking about when your hands is all on me   Cuz I been thinkin about all the possibilities   Ain't no other place that I really want to be   Cuz you swept me off my feet ohh     [Bridge]   Boy, I got my eyes on you   So tell me what you want to do   I can picture you in my room   Until the morning.   I dont even know your name   Boy, I need to know your name   I'm hopin that you feel the same   Tell me if you want it.

I'd recommend the Clubland Classix album - It's quite old now I think, the three CD one (:  Hope you get your cleaning done :p
IWlulffvaa	I have checked two editions and in the "Lento," the bottom note is tied for four measures and the top note is played as written (left hand). For the right hand, there are no consecutive notes and therefore the curve markings must be slurs. The right hand in the end has no tied notations, just slurs.|`|CrAwmz65aa	I say that they are slurred.  If Chopin wanted them tied, he would have written them as half notes.    Same way with the last part.  All of the repeated notes there are slurred also.
6uGxPczpaa	You might want to try www.soundscalpel.com, www.soundboard.com, www.wavsource.com or www.findsounds.com
L8XP51rdaa	You need inspiration and talent to come up with a song. You can't just "ask" a person to make a song for you, that's not very "band" like, unless you're referring to covers.
VZRIlRODaa	Ive never heard that song before.   Its not really my thing, but I loved the dancing.|`|gY9hUx8xaa	You say that britney thing like it's a good thing!    hmm well not my type of music, and it sounds the same as everything else in 'pop' at the moment.

PrYyUoggaa	APATHY -Love Lock Down
ZIMmGqEAaa	Well it depends on what kind of vampire I am going to turn into, if it's the glittery Alaskan vampires of Twilight then no. If I could become the normal, but strong vampires in Underworld or like Blade, I would except without a second thought. Unlike the majority of the people, I don't think being a vampire means you have to have a horrible life or be evil. Your just different and have to do stuff at night.    Oh, as far as food. I would eat blood because I have too. It doesn't mean I would be unable to eat regular food for the taste. It would just have no nutritional value.|`|vqg6wpCLaa	I would decline because I personally do not want to live forever or long enough to watch the world crumble. It's not of any interest to me.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	I would accept, and now, I have a load of free time to kill.    But, the hard part is, you have to move from one place to another. Watching love ones getting older as you stay young. Plus, it'd be hard to explain how you look young for years. Well, the best part is to lie and say that you're the grandson/daughter of so and so.|`|rVTSRQVGaa	decline  who wants 2 live 4 ever???  boring|`|hUYaaXBvaa	i would say probably no  i hate needles so being bitten wouldn't be too fun  plus blood would taste like gross iron or something, i'd want real food  and even though i like overcast days i dont want the sun to damage me  being immortal would be interesting but still  oh and i'm pale anyways so that doesn't bother me  but no|`|AA10159262	Huh, none of the hellspawned bloodsuckers ever asked me if I WANTED to! So I didnt bother to ask them what their prefences were, either.     They're not like the ones you see in manga or anime. They're mostly morons and the most boring morons you can imagine. 'One track mind' describes them.    My sword ate big chunks off of them, until they lay down and shut up.  Rather than red, as I had expected, their juices were a nauseating grey. In the morning, they had become puddles of slime that not even the rats would touch. We had to wait for a heavy rainstorm to be rid of the smell.    Even if they ask politely next time, I think I'll still give them a one-way ticket to the brimstone pits from whence they came....|`|a6fb6708bba705283e524493764398c5aa	Decline. I would be depressed if I never got to go out in the sunlight. And if I couldn't eat food (chocolate, fried dumplings, pizza....) I'd probably kill myself :P|`|USoCUVeOaa	This is a tough question it would depend upon many factors, mainly concerning what type of vampire it would be there are so many different variations out there it almost impossible to answer.|`|MTr4dy3naa	Decline|`|K4DBU7cuaa	i am 12.well i think that i would except. But then again it depends on who the vampire is. Someone that i would want to be with or just some one who i hate. so it would work both ways|`|Rmkxk51daa	I'd accept - as long as I would be like the vampires from The Vampire Chronicles by Anne Rice!  Just because you have the ability to live forever doesn't mean you will!|`|FdqCnU03aa	DECLINE! (:    mainly because I'd rather not drink blood for a living.  Nor would I want to become all uber evil (or look like that)...  and I also wouldn't want to do bad things to my family and friends... ): that would be sad!|`|RwuNA1sDaa	I'd remind myself to stay off the acid.|`|8rlVgcNLaa	if i had someone who i loved who was a vampire, yes but if i didnt have anyone no. Also it would depend on weather the i had the option to not drink human blood. i couldnt drink a humans blood.|`|suRgsVAqaa	depends how fit the vampire was ;)|`|bUsQlloVaa	depends on whether the vampire who ask me is hot or not. :D
bXL9937haa	Sun is in  Libra.   Very sociable, you enjoy being with others and definitely prefer not be alone. Warm and affectionate, you go out of your way to make others like you. You despise ugliness, for you being surrounded by beauty and harmony is a necessity of life. You prefer fine clothing, an attractive home and pleasant surroundings wherever you are. Your refined tastes apply to music and to art as well. At times, you are very indecisive you waver and falter when forced to make a choice because you have the ability to see both sides of any question. The positive part of this is that you are very fair-minded and can be trusted to settle disputes. Your greatest challenge is to take any one- on-one encounter and make the most of it.     Moon is Scorpio.   Your feelings are very intense, never superficial. You tend to be either very angry or very sad or completely and totally happy. Your moods are deep, extreme and not always completely understood by yourself or by those with whom you have to deal. Emotionally, you tend to prefer to live at the cutting edge of life, pushing your reactions to the ultimate extremes, even if the results are dangerous or upsetting. You are easily jealous and very suspicious -- you require a great deal of emotional reassurance. A good detective, you are very curious about deep and mysterious things, especially human nature and motivations. Be careful not to be ruthless, tactless or too overly frank or you will meet with much resistance from others.     Mercury is in Scorpio.   You are a born investigator. You are fascinated by secrets and mysteries and unanswered questions of any kind. When you become upset or angry, your emotional reactions are overpowering -- reason and logic disappear in an uncontrollable passionate outburst. You tend to keep your thoughts secret and bottled up and this makes others regard you with suspicion. It is not that you are trying purposely to be evasive, it is just that you would rather not deal with the explosions and hassles that often occur when you reveal your true feelings and opinions. Your sense of humor tends toward sarcasm and irony.     Venus is in Libra.   A very friendly and outgoing person, you hate to be alone. Beware of a continuing tendency to compromise yourself in order to avoid being lonely. Try to be yourself, not what others would like you to be. You have an innate desire to be in refined and elegant surroundings and will go out of your way to create a plush and comfortable atmosphere around you. You have heightened aesthetic sensibilities and are attracted to music and the arts. Try to avoid using your well-known seductive charm in order to get out of doing what you consider to be dirty work!     Mars is in Scorpio.   Your likes and dislikes are strong and intense, never casual or superficial. You are known for your persistence and willful obsession. Once you have decided on a course of action, you are unstoppable. Your emotional actions tend to be extreme, although you try to keep them muted. You are not quick to anger, you do slow burns. And you tend to release your anger as sarcasm or irony. Beware of your tendency to hold grudges and to be vengeful. When you do fight, or release your internal tensions, you do so body and soul -- you become totally passionate and your outbursts are awesome to behold.     Jupiter is in Libra.   You are generally good at balancing opinions and judging issues, but you tend to be indecisive when it comes to making up your own mind. You are objective and quite concerned with fair play and justice. But, when it comes to yourself, you are so aware that whatever you do might upset the apple cart that you often choose to compromise rather than do anything that might make you lonely or vulnerable. Relationships are very important to you -- you learn about yourself and grow through observing yourself interacting with others. Your aesthetic tastes are refined, but expansive and expensive.     Saturn is in Aquarius.   Your personal sense of values is a reflection of the value structures of your peer group and of those you respect and admire. Try to be more critical in your acceptance of these values -- you tend to prejudge the abilities of those you trust and then follow what they say blindly. Basically very conservative, you prefer orderly, systematic changes and fear doing things rashly or impulsively. Ideas and philosophies must have some sort of immediately realizable, utilitarian function in order for you to pay any attention to them.|`|plBXp91Daa	Your a Libra|`|Wdrzhb3Saa	Libra! Air sign, match is Aries (Fire sign), you're energetic, outgoing, and romantic. Are you not?

D5SO29Qsaa	No, that is not real.  Not only can I tell from having watched the whole thing, but the lighting on the two characters contrasts from each other.    The image of Sasuke comes from episode 11 of Naruto, "The Land Where A Hero Once Lived!"  I unfortunately cannot tell you what episode Hinata is from.|`|a8eb523f1f34be04fb9b4d5c65f11847aa	its fake|`|LJzHR4zhaa	No, it's not real. I've watched around 190 episodes and there is no such thing as Hinata talking to Sasuke (xD). Anyway, it couldn't happen later because Naruto already started the search for Sasuke.  And, yeah, Sasuke's image is from an episode: ''A land where a hero once live'', it's around 15th episode (not sure).|`|MTr4dy3naa	No, they just combined 2 pics.

	here's the thing, hybrid theory was more like nu metal than what meteora was. hybrid theory was an awesome and is an awesome album since it went like 4x platinum or something and because of points of authority, but i prefer meteora. it has more metal-like riffs, like on "hit the floor", and "session" was a great instrumental track. now... minutes to midnight...in my opinion, this one had a more slow, emo-like style, and i think it sucked (by emo i mean kinda depressing stuff like what i've done and bleed it out) . it wasnt their best album, IN MY OPINION, so to answer your question,       1-meterora  2-hybrid theory  3-minutes to midnight      p.s. nothing to do with the question, but does anyone have info on the next album?|`|	1.Meteora  2.Hybrid Theory  3.Minutes To Midnight    But I love them all.|`|	I would say Hybrid Theory,Minutes to Midnight,Meteora|`|	how bout none?  simple plan all the way[:|`|	hybrid theory|`|	HYBRID THEROY, Meteora, Min. to Midnight    LLLLLLL________PPPPPPPPPPPPPPP P  LLLLLLL________PPPPPPPPPPPPPPP P  LLLLLLL________PPPPPP_______PP PP  LLLLLLL________PPPPPP_______PP PP  LLLLLLL________PPPPPPPPPPPPPPP P  LLLLLLL________PPPPPPPPPPPPPPP P  LLLLLLLLLLLLL__PPPPPP  LLLLLLLLLLLLL__PPPPPP  LLLLLLLLLLLLL__PPPPPP|`|	LP best album is going to be the one that Flops and makes no money forcing them into a long permenate retirement in hopes they take the whole Nu Metal genre with them and never ever come back to the metal community ever AGAIN|`|	meteora or minutes to midnight i thimk minutes to midnight|`|	the best is hybrid theory  every song on there is played on the radio and has good musical quality    the second is meteora    third is min to midnight  they went away from their rock and rap roots with this album and i think it failed. The band s failing t stick with what was working and that's just sad      don't forget about the album with jay-z mixed with their songs    that album is far better than min to midnight

sOAOyue7aa	As a person related to people in the music business, I know how people get screwed over with contracts to the point that they get shelved. Realize, Lupe is still "almost famous" in a lot of ways, so its no surprise that stuff like this happens. Look at Q-tip (ironic); the gap between his 2 solo albums is 9 years, and that's because the 2 or 3 albums he was gonna make all got shelved.    As a fan, I'm still happy. That means that he's putting off retirement for at least another year and a half. So I can still get my Lupe fix lol. I just hope he comes up with a better title than "The Great American Rap Album" and add more tracks than just 11.

capSLZQXaa	I don't see how anybody can dislike indie music. ALL bands(with the exception of supergroups,side projects, and the like) at one time were Indie(Independent) before signing to a record label.     Indie is a status, not a sound. Some people have it in their heads that Indie music is mellow alternative stuff, but Indie can be ANY type of music, Blues, Country, Metal, Jazz, etc....         Punk(early 80s hardcore) is my favorite genre of music. 95% of all punk groups are Indie. What do think the DIY(Do It Yourself) ethic is?|`|Nkwv2hygaa	I only listen to classic rock, but God bless those artists trying to make it without the big label hype.|`|j8Gzcc6paa	I love it|`|URo3Ee4oaa	I like it =)|`|7914f974f3cd0a96cc6883956102da35aa	I love indie music.

The plot revolves around four girls who become involved in a series of supernatural murders happening throughout the vicinity of a fictional depiction of New York City.|`|AFbjjLocaa	umm... try:    Jigoku Shoujo     Rumor has it that somewhere on the Internet there is a website accessible only at midnight -- the Hotline to Hell -- where people can ask the Hell Girl to take revenge on people who have wronged them. However, when one person is cursed, two graves are dug, for if the Hell Girl fulfils a request and ferries an antagonist through the gates of Hell, when the one desiring vengeance dies, he too will fall into the pit of Hell to be tormented for all eternity.     Inuyasha    Higurashi Kagome, after being pulled down a well by a demon, finds herself in Feudal Japan, where she learns that a powerful jewel has been reborn inside her body. After the jewel shatters in an attempt to retrieve it from one of the many demons who was after its power, Kagome must join forces with the half-demon Inu Yasha (also after the jewel's power) to track down the shards of the jewel before its power falls into the wrong hands.    Vampire Knight    Yuki's earliest memory is of a stormy night in winter, wherein she was attacked by a vampire... And then rescued by another. Now 10 years later, Yuki Cross, the adopted daughter of the headmaster of Cross Academy, has grown up and become a guardian of the vampire race, protecting her savior, Kaname, from discovery as he leads a group of vampires at the elite boarding school. But also at her side is Zero Kiryu, a childhood friend whos hatred for the creatures that destroyed everything he held dear, is now determined never to trust them. This coexisting arrangement seems all well and good, but have the vampires truly renounced their murderous ways, or is there a darker truth behind their actions. Is Kaname's infatuation with Yuki the beginning of a forbidden romance, or is it something in her forgotten past that draws him to her. Because in this world of secrets, nothing is as it seems. And the price of misplaced trust may even be worse than death.    Tsubasa Chronicle    In the Land of Clow, teenage Syaoran returns from an archaeological dig excavating an ancient ruin, and is greeted by his old childhood friend, Princess Sakura. Sakura wants to confess her feelings for Syaoran, but is interrupted before she could do so.  Later, she meets Syaoran at the ruin. There her latent powers become active and wings (tsubasa) appear on her back as a mysterious person attempts to kidnap her. Syaoran prevents Sakura from being taken, but now Sakura is unconscious and her memories appear to be gone. She will die unless she can get help from the time-space witch Yuuko.  The priest-mage Yukito sends Syaoran across space and time to another universe where Yuuko resides. There, they not only meet Yuuko, but also Kurogane, a powerful ninja who was sent there by Princess Tomoyo from her universe to learn the true meaning of strength, and Fai, a powerful mage and creator of Chii in his world. He's on the run from a sleeping ruler named Ashura.  Yuuko agrees to grant all of their wishes, but at a heavy price. For Kurogane, he must give up his sword in order to travel through dimensions in the hopes of returning home. For Fai, he must give up the tattoos that his magic comes from so he can stay on the run. For Syaoran, he must give up his current relationship with Sakura to travel through the dimensions to find the feathers of her wings which contain her memories. And Sakura, though unconscious, must give up her memories of Syaoran.  Together, the four set off with the critter Mokona, who can locate Sakura's feathers, open doors between universes, and communicate with Yuuko when needed.      if you watched death note the anime you have to try the live action movies.    hope this helped u :)|`|EUQrGKj7aa	Vampire Knight   Code Geass  Blood +  Kyoshiro To Towa No Sora  Zombie Loan   Inuyasha  Eureka Seven   Prism Ark  To- Love-Ru  Special A  Air  Bokura Ga Ita  Gundam Seed  Cardcaptor Sakura  Full Metal Alchemist  Fushigi Yuugi  Fruit Basket  Kaze No Stigma  Kuroshitsuji  Kyou Kara Maou  Love Hina  Night Wizard  Ouran High School Host Club  Pita Ten   Prince Of Tennis  Samurai Deeper Kyo  Tokyo Mew Mew  Trinity Blood      http://www.umaianime.com/anime.php|`|eoOc3b7xaa	vampire night
gIFYYhEWaa	Zephyr Seven,  You're not alone.  Most people have problems with the Bb as well as barring chords, or other chords that really stretch the fingers.  I have this problem and found that if I stuck my elbox into my side I'd be able to twist my hand so I could play a Bb.  Yes, I looked kinda awkward....but it worked.  In time I've been able to change this technique.    Here's something else to try.  Is your thumb on the back of the neck and your palm not touching the neck at all?  Your chording hand should be shaped like a claw and there should be daylight between the neck and the palm of your hand.  If your hand is shaped like a claw then the only thing touching your ukulele will be your thumb and fingers.  R.R.Bear said the action may be high.  That means the strings might be high off the frets which means more effort when pressing the strings to chord.  Do you have trouble playing other chords?  Some people feel if you have a ukulele strap (like a guitar strap) then you're not really a ukulele player.  I  find it helps me play chords better and I don't care what other people think.  I have a strap for every ukulele I play.  Have fun,  CowUkeA|`|aJu53IX4aa	Would your song sound OK if you substituted a Bb7?|`|jgEvnYNlaa	You have to develop better hand strength. Playing scales will help. Try playing them in thirds. Also, you can try using some of the grip hand strengthening devices available from most music stores. The gripmaster should help you.   The action on your uke may be too high.Take it to a repair shop and ask them if they can lower the action a bit.
ayC3MsEWaa	I did this in my science class. The density of water is 1.0 grams. An object has to be lighter than water to float or has to me in the shape of a boat. Lets say that a piece of wood is 0.79 grams per square centimeter then it will float because it is lighter than a centimeter cubed of water. Everything is mostly in cubic centimeters or meters but that depends on if your in the U.S.A. email me for more information.|`|DABa3Cjyaa	It depends on the objects size, weight, and shape. One of the classic examples would be a feather and a rock, the rock weighs more, the size is going to vary, depends on which rock, and the shape is most likey to round. Where a feather is little, light, and narrow. Hope that helped =)|`|P01LNcrmaa	if its less dense than water it will float and more dense it will sink density of water is about 1.00 g/ml|`|QUJIwRUcaa	Well, density would affect the weight, right? And if weight is too much, it won't float.|`|evXyQqbLaa	Any object, wholly or partly immersed in a fluid, is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.    If the weight of an object is less than the weight of the displaced fluid when fully submerged, then the object has an average density that is less than the fluid and has a buoyancy that is greater than its own weight. If the fluid has a surface, such as water in a lake or the sea, the object will float at a level where it displaces the same weight of fluid as the weight of the object. If the object is immersed in the fluid, such as a submerged submarine or air in a balloon, it will tend to rise. If the object has exactly the same density as the fluid, then its buoyancy equals its weight. It will tend neither to sink nor float. An object with a higher average density than the fluid has less buoyancy than weight and it will sink. A ship floats because, although it is made of steel, which is denser than water, it encloses a volume of air and the resulting shape has an average density less than that of the water.

jsCjGUPuaa	i agree and y would u want to talk to miley cyrus??? eww well anyways if she really wanted people to hav it it would be on her myspace like some other celebs do|`|k39bNUgeaa	hahaha    You kids actually think you can get celebrities personal information    hahahah    Also kid stalking is illegal    Have fun in jail|`|VWpmbf2xaa	oh yeah sure i have it. her email is: imaslut@isuck.com and her phone number is 666-666-6666|`|C5QV222iaa	you dont need it unless you are her friend, she doesnt want stupid fan people to have them. get over it.|`|Fyt9JxTqaa	Do you really think someone on Yahoo Answers actually knows Miley Cyrus cell or email? And why would she just give it out to the public? You need a reality check.    Stalking is illegal you know, so have fun in jail if you're willing to do this crap.
TwQLIf22aa	I agree, sharmusic.com or swstrings.com. These are large, reputable dealers that get a lot of school orders. $200 is just about enough to get a sturdy, functional outfit (case, bow and violin) with ebony fittings that is set up properly. There's a lot of internet trash out there for less, but you'll soon have broken strings, pegs, bridges and other problems like the strings being too high, cheap wood that warps and open seams. Students bring these cheap ones to school all the time.     If you're on a budget I would go with a $20 fiberglass bow (not "brazilwood" it warps) and a $30 thermoplastic case (very sturdy). You'll also want a shoulder rest, Kun is a popular brand at about $20, an electronic tuner, there's a $20 Korg tuner that is great, and a set of extra strings. There are some inexpensive strings called Overture that are $10 and they're not too bad. The customer service at Shar and Southwest Strings is very helpful. A local dealer will probably have decent instruments and good advice but you will pay extra, possibly 100s more.|`|AA12141468	There are so many different kind of violins, it depends of your budget to but one, also, it depends in where you live, so, my opinion is, try to go to the nearest music school or if you know someone who plays the violin and ask to give you the advice.  Actually, you have to take someone with you who knows about violins, or if you can take it for 2 days maybe and show it to some violinists, and listen to the sound more than one time. That what i do and what i learned to do.    Good luck,|`|rNqF4gIVaa	Pretty much all violins are made of wood. There is no way to to give a make... each one is different and you should get guidance from your teacher. If you go to a reputable luthier then you'll get what you pay for.    $200 is about a tenth of whats required for a decent violin.|`|UXM5BMTXaa	You should ask the advice of someone who knows how to play the violin because she/he knows what violin will be the best for you.    Just like me, I have the best violin suited for me at a respectable price ~|`|odITpObGaa	Try a starter instrument at Shar Music or Southwest Strings.   Won't be GREAT instruments, but they are in your price range and they back up their product.

yjvBnW71aa	id think its safe for water (just not a bubble bath) but i warn u the hair takes forever to dry and so do the clothes so make sure the clothes are off and be redy for the 2 hour drying process of hair|`|DABa3Cjyaa	get her a rubber ducky instead|`|aR2Y0ytTaa	I would tell your daughter the doll isn't made to go into the pool or the tub. Try to talk her out of it and tell her she can play with it when she gets out of the pool or tub. If she throws a fit, you should hide the doll and say "You threw me a fit, so now you won't get to play with it until tomorrow." If it doesn't work, you should spank her cause a lot of moms I know do that. I hope my idea works and good luck with your daughter.         P.S: I'm not trying to make you feel i want you to make your daughter cry of be sad. =] also, it will take the hair to dry a really long time. But it's up to you if you want your child to have her doll in the tub.|`|AA11958479	wholly cow. a doll that cost 95 dollars shouldnt go in the tub. oh wait a minute if my cute little daughter asked can dollie come in the tub, the answer would be a quick sure why not. but then again i dont have any 95 dollar dolls, but if she is plastic i dont see why not!!

I tried watching Smallville too and it was good but it just doesn't have the same kick as Supernatural.  Supernatural really keeps me on the edge of my seat - last season's cliffhanger drove me crazy all last summer waiting to see what would happen to Dean.

"And our love become a funeral pyre"? Really, Jim?|`|dYyiG90caa	Nope !!    His Poetry WAS Modern -- But I think he had a Natural Gift for the "Musicality of Words" and His Structure was Unique --    But -- (to me) A GREAT and Powerful POET, none the less.    Do Not Forget -- Samuel Coleridge (late-17th, early-18th C.) Wrote --     "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" & "Kubla Khan" --    Both -- Broke all the Rules of Poetry, for His Time -- and it took a While for People to Accept Him.    But, to me -- "Kubla Khan" remains the Greatest Poem ever Written :)    Back to MORRISON -- His Books of Poetry "The Lords and The New Creatures" (1969) & "An American Prayer" are BRILLIANT (to me).    ...and The Doors recording of  "An American Prayer" is a Beautifully Crafted Album.    When it comes down to it -- I think it is Just a Matter of Taste.    If you Do NOT Care for Morrison -- No Prob -- That's Fair, because YOU are YOUR Own Judge.    I happen to Think he is Brilliant -- I because I'M am MY Own Judge.    For what it's Worth -- There are about a Hundred "Great Poets" that I LOATHE lol :))    A matter of taste :)    Good Q, though !!  .|`|Wj7mBxFJaa	well it was a different time, a different lifestyle.

Momo is in love with Toji, a taciturn baseball player, but the scheming Sae also has her eye on the boy. Momo's life is further complicated with the introduction of Kairi Okayasu, a wise-cracking playboy who is determined to make her his because she had saved him from drowning the summer before high school started.    Things became even more complicated when Sae, in an attempt to make Momo miserable, spread rumors about Momo and Kairi making out. Some of the rumors were true and when Touji was hospitalized Sae forced Toji to break up with Momo. They soon got back together and later Sae tried to make their relationship complicated again by threatening to discredit Momo with her newly acquired access to the mass media. Though Toji was defiant to begin with, he reluctantly broke up with Momo in order to protect her. Momo was heartbroken at first, especially because she did not know that it was part of Sae's schemes. However, she eventually began dating Kairi, whom she had previously considered annoying, and soon began to fall in love with him.    When Toji reveals to Momo what had happened and why he breaks up with her, Momo is left to choose between Toji and Kairi. More problems arose and a love triangle was formed.    In "Sae's Story", Sae is left back a year, for she always was skipping classes. She is too stubborn so she goes to Momo's and Kairi's university every day. Toji goes to a good university by himself. Sae then meets one of her childhood sweethearts, Kanji (or Monkey Boy), who left for Malaysia when they were young, and promised to marry Sae when he was back. In love with Sae, Kanji follows her around, trying to win Sae back over. He also takes care of Sae's dog, Sora, when her parents would no longer let her keep it. The dog walks with a little limp, as one day when the dog tried to follow her, Sae threw a rock at its paw and injured her. Sae starts modeling and pretends she goes to college with Momo, when she is really still in high school. She meets Honda and works for CC as a model. She meets a guy named Takuma, but later he turned Sae down. Later, she meets another guy named Shinji but realizes he never really liked her. All these ups and downs makes Sae realize that Momo, Kairi, and Kanji are the only people that actually care for her.|`|PEGZmw73aa	Don't listen to Blade, watch Ichigo 100%|`|RwuNA1sDaa	'Kay, I'm just going for the generic response since I don't feel like bringing up my long list of shoujo manga -diesforbeingaguywithoutmalepride- (I still have yuri!) that fangirls would throw away the ones they know for.    1. Don't look for harem anime. Just don't bother.    2. Lots of people like Vampire Knight, though you seem to have known about that kind of thing    3.

lwG6tvOqaa	You don't want fame to come as fast as it did for Miley. You can tell that it all overwhelmed her even though her dad was already a famous country singer.    Anyway, you don't have to be able to write a song to be a singer. Try to find someone who you think would understand you the most, and see if they are a talented writer. There are many singers that don't write their own stuff, but are still very successful.     Im sure there is someone in your city that has the same goal in life, so try to go to places where small town bands would most likely perform, and im sure that you will meet some people that can help you out.|`|k39bNUgeaa	hahaha    You think miley is a good singer.

BHwRNzMzaa	Dont get me wrong it was a great film, and he was a fantastic actor but it did get a hell of a lot more media coverage because of heaths death simple as, the whole publicity was about it being his last film and how great he was in it|`|vI3Ihd6gaa	Id like to believe so, i personally thought it was a great movie. And they did so much advertising for it that it probably would have made a lot of money regardless of whether he lived or died.|`|qydcoAbFaa	I think it would have.  It was my favorite out of all the Batman movies.|`|FEb0qWoVaa	I think it'd still be just as successful. I thought the movie as a 10/10 and I couldn't care less about Heath Ledger. That movie is a classic.|`|D657vcVsaa	his role was really good but the others were kinda funny, batman with the raspy voice and maggie gyllenhaal's character felt like she was trying to hard, plus the movie was so long. but i think ledger did an amazing job on the joker, even if he hadn't died, he would still get noticed for his work.|`|4CxlX0s9aa	It may have not been second top grossing movie in history but i think it still would have been up there|`|AA11792318	I personally believe that Heath Ledgers death (may he Rest In Peace) gave the movie a lot of extra publicity. I personally didn't think the movie was all that good storyline wise. The sound effects were very unbalanced--whenever someone was talking, I had to turn the volume way up to hear what was being said, and then be ready to mute the volume at a moments notice whenever explosions or gunfire took place. Another situation that I was unhappy about was how a lot of the fighting scenes took place in the dark and it was hard to see what was going on--like that scene near the end when they use the radar or whatever to detect where the bad guys are...that gave me one of the worst headaches trying to watch it. I also did not like Batman's voice--it was very hard to understand. I don't think Christian Bale did as good of a performance in this movie as he did in the first one.    On a couple of positive notes however: The CG effects were very well done and Heath Ledgers performance was absolutely amazing and I don't think anyone else could have done his part any better. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, though they did not have a lot of screen time, did a very good job. As a matter of fact...I think if it wasn't for these three actors, the movie would have been a total flop.|`|ROmGmlVSaa	Interesting question.  I think you have to compare the films publicity after he died to the publicity beforehand. There was a lot of hype before his death, but it absolutely exploded afterwards.  I think people so badly wanted to believe it would be something spectacular, especially after many believe the film was what caused his death (rumoured reason that he was taking sleeping pills in the first place was because the role disturbed him so much) it's perhaps soothing for people to think that his death and his struggle produced an amazing character and film.    I'm not sure; I think the oscar nominations and the critical acclaim etc. would have been the same, the public response would not have been so intense if not for his death.|`|sKtZYdEdaa	I think it absolutely would have been as successful.  His performance is way above and beyond par in that film and everyone was rushing to the theater to see if all the hype about Ledger's Joker was true or false. People had to make sure that the role was taken care of and see the character that Jack Nicholson had initially made so infamous. Personally, I think Heath knocked Nicholson on his *** comparatively.  But, yes, absolutely. The movie would have been just as big if Heath had still been alive.  Which, in turn, would make all the awards Heath had nods for, and has won, a little less bittersweet.

It looks at both legal and not-so-legal sources.     save the page, i doubt that its going to last very long (though i'm sure there are a billions mirrors of it by now =D).    my favorite is Motion Empire @ "http://85.17.168.10/"    happy bootlegging!    -Shamar!    p.s. i want to send out a preemptive "FU*K YOU" to all the assholes who will give an "i'm to good to watch movies streaming online" answer. =D|`|wdM1MZuSaa	movie6.net

You should be able to watch all the previous episodes from there!|`|GLnVPp2Caa	ABC.com has all four of the previous seasons posted on their website.  You can watch the full episodes using their online player for FREE!    I often miss episodes and need to get caught up and sometimes it's just to feed my addiction between episodes.    The other thing is that it's limited commercials, so you'll get to watch the episodes in about 45 minutes, with only about 3 minutes total of commercial time.    You don't have to register or anything.  Just go to abc.com    LOVE IT!|`|JkdK9mataa	It is certain that abc.com is a good choice for online watch.Also there are some other site for online watch.If you do really interested in this show i recommend you to get one for collection.Then you can watch it again and again.|`|Dnd1ET6naa	Torrentz.com    search for: lost season    you need utorrent.exe from utorrent.com    and dont forget to seed :)
1lh7oQsPaa	6.0    You have a good sense of pitch, which a lot of people don't have, and I like the overall tone of your voice, but it's a wee bit nasal for my taste.  I always recommend lessons for someone with a decent voice who hasn't had basic voice training.  If you seriously want to sing, it's worth the time & money!    That said, I think you could make a LOT of improvement by just allowing yourself to really FEEL the song while you're singing it...  Audiences will forgive small mistakes (breathiness, nasal tone, etc.) when they're FEELING you.  You seemed to be rushing through & not taking time to convey the MEANING of the words.    Singing is basically ACTING, so learn to play to your audience, even if you're sitting alone in your room...   I'm a songwriter & I have a wall of pictures that I sing to when I'm practicing & recording... If it's a love song, I usually sing it to Johnny Depp... It sounds very silly, but it works.|`|50rPQzn6aa	i would say 3.5 for both  i think u should work on ur breathing more  u sounded a little breathy  and go to a professional to work on the high pitches  ur voice was cracking so thats what i would suggest
4imsjgE2aa	Is this the episode you were thinking of?    Season 6, Episode 17: Combat    Original Air Date March 22, 2007    Clark and Chloe discover that Titan, another alien escapee from the Phantom Zone, is the hulking star of a secret fight club whose bloody, bare-knuckle battles to the death are broadcast on the Internet. Lois smells a story and investigates on her own but is captured by fight manager-presenter Maddox, the Belle Reve administrator, and forced to become wrestler Athena's first opponent. To save Lois, Clark reveals his ability to catch bullets to Maddox so he can fight Titan, but is stunned to face Lois in the ring instead... Lana returns from her honeymoon with Lex, whose men are looking for Titan, but she's more uncertain about living the life of wealthy and power and has a traumatic miscarriage.

43bb1de059cf4886a340467b97276fecaa	Bella's private mind that rejected some vampires' special abilities while she was human evolved after she became a vampire; her ability formed into allowing her to shield those around her from the mental powers of some other vampires.     Bella is referred to as a "shield." Right now she can shield herself from others, and eventually she can put a shield over anyone she wants. It's like an invisible force field that can keep other vampires from using their powers.|`|GNkR9R8baa	Her power is like a shield like Violet from the Incredibles. She blocks people with a shield. Edward can't read her mind unless she wants him to. The other vampires can't do anything to her. Like Jane or the other vampires who have a talent. The shield is around her brain that is how Jasper and Alice can still do things to her.|`|602qkbf7aa	Bella has an internal shield that she uses outside her brain to protect those around her.|`|OPPEqh1Waa	she a shield...you know the way edward can't read her mind   or jane and alec couldn't her her with their powers...it protects her form anyone doing thing like that(like with her mind)    she works on making it stretch out to other peolpe around her  she spreads it around edwar and renesmee first...because she got angry    so then when the volturi came she got angry (protective of edward and everyone)so it spread out over then and the pack(but not the volturi)alec and jane coluldn't her then then..unless then used physical force    at the very end she removes the shied just for a secound(she found that hard)and edward saw into her mind..a sweet way to end it since it always wondered what was goin on inside her head    hope this helped    xoxo|`|fO6depqaaa	Isn't it that she's a blocker?

yyfZMWE1aa	in my opinion , LOTR is the best (:  so yup|`|BKybwvF5aa	It is one of the best movies, but according to a lot of people's list it's not within the top 5. It is number one on my list though following the Star Wars Trilogy.|`|Yf3IgvYBaa	judging by the complete lack of responses, it appears the public disagrees with you|`|CAY9zwp8aa	wellll ,  some people are very shallow and don't  like watching movies with actual plot  lines.     It could be one of the top 5 based  on story and the overall movie,  but if the public voted?    Sorry, I doubt it.|`|qydcoAbFaa	Return of the King is  2 in All TIme World-Wide Box Office sales.

os6FaEBlaa	I can rhyme faster when I freestyle but my similes, metaphors, and alliteration aren't as good as my written stuff.    I prefer written, because the rapper has a better flow, can make a meaning, etc......|`|NctYwdvhaa	freestyling because you have a writer's block when you try and write raps. eventually, you get to a stage where you can, but freestyling seems easier as it is spontaneous, and you spit anything you can.|`|0o8csqmuaa	writing rhymes is best to put your thoughts down when there is no beat, but when the beat comes on, its eaiser to freestyle.     But the thing about freestyle is sometimes u say some stupid sh!t, unless your jay-z or lil wayne, but were all not that talented.     So I say you got to combine both elements in order to be successful.|`|uePD9IAXaa	sometimes i get a calling for both. not that i have done either much lately. when i started i would always quickly scrawl rhymes on paper but after a while you develop the mental thought patterns to be able to spontaneously come up with rhymes and dont have to write them. i've barely written a rap in years.   i prefer written because it is more polished and probably has been edited to sharpen it up. only a few emcees are really good at freestyles but when they are it is just as good i guess.  if i have been drinking then it is easy to get in a zone and kick rhymes.|`|bd1fcb5d764c68e35c6336cba1138542aa	Well, both can be done rather easily.  But if you want a quality verse, I'd say freestyling would be much harder.    I really have no preference when it comes to freestyling or a written verse.  As long as it sounds good, I'll listen.  A good freestyle is always very impressive.  But a guy just stumbling over rhymes of the same three words is pretty unbearable.  But then again, anybody could sit down and write an equally bad verse.

I think it's just some of those lyrics that don't necessarily mean anything, but sound good and fit well into the song.|`|et19Kxclaa	Not really; I don't usually take the time to pay close attention to an obnoxious TV show's theme song.

Does she not understand that she is a significant and unfortunately  popular person with little kids and has she not figured out that the paparazzi are gonna be all over her ALL the time because of her numerous scandals?    Gosh, she needs to really grow up. Miley is just silly Disney trash and I hate her f***ing slutty fugly guts.|`|1620f8acd8e6a1bab16fb6d4bd625f7baa	I agree...  Some people could make those outfits look great, but everything she wears makes her look awkward and weird.|`|AA11875266	I actually liked her clothes in the 1st picture ..... =O   I won't wear that type of clothing but it looks good.     The 2nd picture - wow!!!    Miley does have a nice sense of style.  But sometimes she will wear tacky clothing.|`|1PGmB4JNaa	she doesn't dress like crap and if she did how does it affect you? she's not out there saying you dress like **** so stop sippin on that haturaid      edit: who said you hated her? i said don't hate on her clothes because it doesn't affect you, it's your opinion and you're putting it out there so im doing the same and if you're saying i can't spell? what did i spell wrong? haturaid? ummm that was on purpose stupid betch you totally took my words and twisted them up so stfu and stop wasting pts while im getting some|`|AA10112346	Bahahaha. Sucks for Disney! [boob thing]    Yes I do.|`|Fyt9JxTqaa	Miley Cyrus is a slutty b*tch. End of story.|`|333YjT8Maa	Miley Cyrus is a slut. There is nothing more than that, she is just a slut. I just wish she would go away|`|c9e83377d7336eed482d84b85be3bf55aa	SHES basically just a little skank lol she just needs to stop on Disney channel and go on making porno lol|`|jzH53hADaa	Yes, i tottaly aggree. I think she tries to have her own style, but i dont find it to appealing. I think tacky was the perfect word, lol.|`|cWfTvJTcaa	Miley Cyrus is trash.  The girl can't sing, can't act, and can't dance, and, if you watch her in an interview, is as annoying as hell and clearly obsessed with her self. She's not pretty, either, so I wonder what talent we're supposed to admire.  I can't see anything that is appealing about her, and I definitely can't understand why so many people are so impressed by her.|`|rl6MRtVWaa	Don't be jealous ;)|`|FYT97XLgaa	I hate her.
Dd5YdYFFaa	The uninvited for sure if your into thrillers or scary movies  but bride wars also seems great|`|GNkR9R8baa	Mall Cop. Uninvited didn't make a lot of sense and it was confusing. Bride Wars was okay. New in Town doesn't look good nd it got a low rating.|`|em0wuHyGaa	its between bride wars and the uninvited.|`|fO6depqaaa	I'd say New in Town or Mall Cop|`|m9PwT7eSaa	I say The Uninvited if u want scary  or Bride Wars if u don't..|`|OIjhFSzjaa	new in town or the uninvited
lV8i73unaa	an older one, but it's GREAT!!!!!  "Buried Alive"   There are a few of them out there, but I think the best ones are the two with "Tim Masterson" in them!!!    Ya' gotta watch the first one first though!  Unless you can only get your hands on two right now.   I mean, you'll understand it just fine, but, I think it would be more fun to see them in order for the first time!    Have fun!!!    *smile*|`|8815883e2ab4555a79f3a28621142ab1aa	The Strangers was good.

yjSGVfdiaa	This is actually the only Animal Collective album I don't own - can't find it anywhere.  It's a good effort, but disjointed.  It's interesting to see Avey Tare's craziness get more and more wrangled in with each subsequent release.  It's still there - and when it comes out, it has much more of an impact now that he's become much more strategic in it's use.|`|7fEVNng5aa	Thanks for the link. I've gone through a few tracks now, and Spirit They've Vanished and Penny Dreadfuls really stood out for me. Excellent tracks|`|YbmklSzGaa	Definitely a fantastic band. I agree this is not as good as Strawberry Jam, but it's still good.|`|yZD0f5tzaa	Hello!    There were some nice songs on there. I enjoyed La Rapet.|`|7B2s7maWaa	A lot of really awesome tracks here.  My favorite being "Penny Dreadfuls".  They are a very interesting and very cool band.  I still need to pick up their albums.  Thanks for posting and sharing Likegib. :]
1JB1aDzJaa	i think she'll get with mervin<br>  but thats just my opinion|`|Ftj7j577aa	I really don't think she will stay with Ricky.  Also about the baby, the show is based on here and staying pregnant. Once she has it what will the show focus on then. If she gives it up for adoption, the show would have to end because the interesting baby daddy drama will end. SH ehas to keep it

J5HEveZAaa	i was caught cheating when my boyfriend was cheating|`|kPWGVeWhaa	One time while camping I was WASTED and asked this chick I met "If I eat you out, will you give me a ********?"  and her boyfriend was right there.  <br>  <br>  it makes me cringes to just think of that.|`|tGAt3ZKkaa	This is NOWHERE near my most embarrassing moment, its more like the most embarrassing moment for my friends boyfriend AND me.<br>  <br>  We were at the beach, pretty far out, her boyfriend was surfing and we were just floating around on a massive board her dad had made.<br>  And a massive wave came at us all and knocked her BF of his surfboard and us off the board. And while I was under the water my bikini bottoms came off and my friend BF did a face plant on my bare butt!!!<br>  <br>  OMG!! I tried to talk to him saying "uh, what a coincidence!, me, you . . . my butt!" and I paused "did I just say that?"<br>  <br>  every thing between the 3 of us was just quiet for at least 1 hour.<br>  <br>  lol<br>  <br>  AND<br>  <br>  We had 70's night at my school, and I wa sin year 7 and so I didn;t know whatw as going on and what we were going to have to do and so, I grabbed my arm and said "what the hell is going on I feel like an idiot" she was holding a microphone and so everyone heard it.<br>  I felt like an idiot.<br>  <br>  AND<br>  <br>  I was with my friend and her BF (yes the same BF that face planted into my butt) and we were at the movies, my crush came in and we went to sit up the top.<br>  As my crush sat down, my friends BF said to me "hey Jen stop" I turned out I was in such a dreamland of love (lol) was leaning over the next rail of seats.<br>  I sat up and (oh, i forgot to say that infront of us was a long wide rail down to the front of the room) and so when we got up, (the movie wasn't over, we just hated it) I tipped over my friends foot and landed on the wide rail and when my friend and her BF tried ot help me they accidently let go and I went sliding down the rail!<br>  I was screaming, really loud, saying things like "OMG help me!! aug!!"<br>  I hit the bottom and fell off the side and I got up to see everyone laughing their butts off.<br>  <br>  OMG and there are SO many more embarrassing moments of mine but it would take a book to list them all.|`|ChwKz1qyaa	i was walking out of the school doors...<br>  then BAM my feet slipped and i feel...<br>  down each<br>                 and<br>                      every<br>                              step!<br>  my face expresiion was PRICELESS<br>  all i could do was sit there and look shocked! O.O<br>  i cut my hand and got a BIG bruise on my butt but DAMN it was funny as HELL! <br>  (:|`|1x3BHGpdaa	I'm pregnant so i went to the bathroom and thought i only had to pee and ended up letting out a really loud fart and i boo booed! and i had no clue that i had to! it was the most embarrassing thing EVER!|`|qSwaXLBeaa	Fell off my chair in Assembly. LOL infront of the whole school, I actually went forward and not back either, to make matters worse.|`|HF1TfsnTaa	One of my contacts walked in on me while i was bathing. Is Taylor your brother?|`|oFL3H3PXaa	This message may be disturbing: <br>  <br>  Had to put the Fox News disclaimer. Okay, I was really high and drunk one time. And I was with this hot chick! I took her pants off and we were ready to get it on like Marvin Gaye, but I couldn't get my johnson up, lol! Very embarrassing, it haunted me for a long time. I tried jerkin it, lol, and tried and tried, but I just failed. She probably told all her friends I had a little penis, but it just wasn't erect. But, what are ya gonna do?  You get deep emotional wounds, but you got to find SOME way to digest it and move on. And the older you get, the more you have. Thats life!  lmao

NO|`|Na7ZN72daa	I think Honesty is ALWAYS the best policy. Lying never solves problems, it just delays them, and they end up even worse!!|`|AAgX0SDcaa	Usually, exceptions are those which could devastate someone or bruise their ego, it's better not to answer honestly. If a mother asks me if her newborn is the prettiest baby I've ever seen, and I know it will hurt the mother to say "no,she wouldn't win a beauty contest", I will agree that the baby is pretty, because she is the most beautiful baby to that mother.. If it was a matter of life-and-death, say being held hostage or being raped, I would say it's OK to lie your face off, do whatever you can to save yourself or others. I had to lie once to make someone confess to something, the person went right to the police and spilled his guts on everything he did to me. More than I expected out of anyone so mean, but he did something so evil that it lead to  the deaths of two innocent people.|`|9mPux1fFaa	Not always.

4imsjgE2aa	I am wondering if you are thinking of the episode House overdoses on<br>  Oxycodone?<br>  <br>  Season 3 - Episode 10 - "Merry Little Christmas"<br>  <br>  First Aired: 12/12/2006<br>  <br>  It’s Christmas Eve and the deal runs out the next day. Wilson offers his friend company but House isn’t interested. Back at his apartment, House considers the pills and then calls his mom and leaves a message saying “Merry Christmas.” He then takes some pills with alcohol. Later Wilson arrives and comes in to find House on the floor vomiting from a combination of the alcohol and the new painkillers.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tv.com/house/merry-little-christmas/episode/888757/summary.html?tag=ep_list;title;10" rel="nofollow">http://www.tv.com/house/merry-little-chr...</a>|`|YIcBd569aa	i think margret MM is right, house has always used too much vicodin. its talked about through the entire series. but there is one episode where the dare him to stop taking it. and he goes with out it for awhile even putting himself in a detox clinic. but he dosen't over dose per say he just a junkie when it comes to his usage of vicodin. can you remember anything else that happened in the episode you are reffering too? what was the medical case of the patient about? that might help narrow it down a bit too.

ZfsgIDa0aa	He was apart of the New Avengers team, along with others like Spiderman, but the central and original team didn't include Wolverine, so I highly doubt he'd be in the Avengers movie that's coming out.

Coming to Church is not a fashion show or contest, you're there for God, nothing else and His home is yours because you're His child. As long as it's nothing revealing, come the way you feel comfortable, God sees the heart, not what you're wearing. Don't feel like you need to dress to impress, come as you are. Don't let you're clothing determine who you are or your self worth.     God Bless|`|IRUa78qZaa	Hey,      I know what you mean I ain't thin either. And who cares what they wear.

Go to work every day.  Pay your bills.  And make good decisions in life.  I am 37 and I just started acting like an adult about 5 years ago.  So in my eyes if you dont act like an adult you have 2 years to act a fool.    Uncle Rob|`|TwrGic9Uaa	Yes, a daily occurrence here too.

We were having break one afternoon and talking about gangs, and someone mentioned the small town south of here might have a gang. I popped off the remark "i think there will never be gangs down there, those kids would probably shoot themselves in the foot if they ever got guns"  Well, the summer temp looked at me and said "Why don't you act your age?"  and stomped away. He lived on the edge of that town, and his cousin, who was also working with us,  told me he was cleaning his gun and it went off and he barely missed his foot.  I think he thought she told me about it beforehand, but it was just a coincidence.|`|d55f9fa303ffed7693f24381e6799502aa	Yes my husband has said it....

b9cZE7nTaa	unfortunately they dont make an adults/sex category, b/c its another reason for little kids to go ahead & read them & then let the trolls report more people    ive always suspected Yahoo Answers is secretly against you|`|XnCeN07Uaa	there..is ...|`|kJ7mcPLbaa	I LOVE sex questions. The Jonas Sisters and Miley questions are completely out of hand though!|`|yTCEJRC9aa	sex! AHAHAHAHA!!|`|AnIgXRcJaa	I totally agree with you. I cannot believe the questions that 13 year olds are asking. Just wow. They need some one to watch the questions that are being asked and throw people off for asking rant things on here.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	No. I think some people on here are just overly sensitive and report everything they see. Some people need to lighten up|`|BZuy7Rrmaa	that's not really part of the format here on yahoo   but you can ask in a crafty way without being to inconspicuous  or just out and out lewd.|`|Mfe6r2khaa	I LOVE SEX QUESTIONS WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO|`|INf502UUaa	No.|`|dhj3ynjeaa	oh definitely...especially with all the teenagers coming on here and reading stuff that they shouldn't be reading...|`|IHa6FxE6aa	All the little kids should just leave.|`|AA11085654	I sure hope they are. There are too many idiots asking if they are pretty here.|`|2624d3bf8e4e63e26e8d8d37caca1505aa	Yes considering the age of a lot of people in here I'm an adult and I find some of it offensive.|`|2BEMSGPdaa	There is.  This is it. If you choose to allow your 13  yr old to participate on here then  so be it  We all know that there are a lot of 10 & 12 yr OLDs that are taking part and can only blame the parents who fail to supervise them.  Most people try to avoid crass language   but some topics are just for meant for  adult oriented sites.|`|YXgVGjHlaa	Definitely!  There are too many kids asking questions about  sex and they get too inappropriate.  I really don't think there should be anything inappropriate whether it be adult or a child.  This question and answer forum should be a learning tool but there are so many uneducated people using it, you feel that they are really not open for advice.|`|AA10742567	I agree with you on that.

JqqRFFsyaa	Very true. I saw it just yesterday, when someone called deathcore crap, another dude called most metalheads jackasses. WTF?!?? I think I yelled at the INQUIRER in a Paramore question, but I can't think of another occasion when I have. It's stupid and low to attack a person based on their musical tastes. And to spread the love? Myfriendgoo, I love you.   :P|`|C7YbYUYPaa	Yeah, I try to just avoid it if they ask for tour dates, or something like that.  I can't resist however, if a question comes up that attempts to compare MCR or the Jonas Brothers to Led Zeppelin or The Beatles, then they just ask for it.    Some people just can't help themselves, but whatever, I guess we are entitled to our opinions.|`|OTFzJbaMaa	i couldnt agree more.   i sometimes on here lose my temper but its only when people ask questions i thiink are ignorant.   i also avoid questions about bands like fall out boy and all that. iits not like if you dont like them you have to be mean to those who do. also their all mostly 12-15 year old girls who genuinly belive that are in the rock genre so its better to just keep your mouth shut and have some common courtesy.     the only time i get pretty upset on here is when someone is mean to someone else for no reason like when someone asks a questions about being glad someone is dead... thats just wrong, terrible, and competley inconsiderate and that person has some crap coming to them because of karma.     so yes i agree with you  I LOVE EVERRYYONE!!|`|0a88332d968993b9b9d62ec94243eb24aa	I have never been a user to rant on other persons musical taste ever.  It is a fact that my own musical taste is extremely eclectic, so I would be the last person to bash others.    You can find Opeth in my Ipod right next to Madonna or Michael Jackson. I don't give a f@ck what other persons love or listen to. I know what I love, good enough for me.    I never participated in the anti MCR or Tokyo Hotel rants. Not my style as opposed to some other users right on this very page...|`|NQ37mnWkaa	Did I miss something...?    Bullies are bad enough out in the real world, let alone here on R&P.   I make a point of avoiding questions that don't appeal to my music tastes, but some people on here can be very petty and immature.     {{{HUGS}}} for all ~ Silver feels like spreading the love :)|`|kdo492J7aa	You are right. My opinion is that people are just rude. I don't like it when people dis other people's opinion on a specific topic. We do need to start spreading some love.|`|1MLIYilNaa	That's why I try to avoid this section.  But obviously sometimes I can't help but to wander over here to see what's going on.. because I do like some of the questions asked here and I want to answer them but hardly do because I'd just get bashed because I have a "sh!t taste in music"    ..And I would never ever ever even THINK of asking an MCR related question here!  Because 99.9% of the answer's would be something along the lines of:  "MCR SUCK"  "LISTEN TO REAL MUSIC"  or  "GERARD WAY IS A WINEY EMO F@G WHO CAN'T SING"  It's ridiculous.|`|YaXO6crXaa	You're right. Spread love today. I love you QUESTIONER lol.    The word you were looking for is (I think) asker.    EDIT: XP|`|9hFexadLaa	lots of people on here hope that Kurt Cobain is burning in hell, how can you say that about him or anyone, what did he ever do to them? all those people that say that most likely will burn in hell    EDIT: I'm not hoping they burn in hell, I want nobody to burn, I just think that is extremely rude of them to say|`|PCcbECdZaa	You're completely and utterly right. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed and cave in to the rude behavior because my opinion is so strong; that's horrible and I will cease. Good point! Love your questions.|`|Wj7mBxFJaa	I'll admit, I've been a bully before... not so much here as in Books and Authors though and that's because there are so many Twilight questions you can't find any questions about real books :-\|`|5uvTte8Zaa	Who's "we"?    I don't agree with bullying either, I was just kidding.  Sometimes my answers have some hidden sarcasm, but it's only to help people think.   I'm with you, NO BULLYING!!!!!!!!|`|2f1IEC1Qaa	welcome to the kinder genteeler  cyber-america  where the punks have mouths like alligators and a ss's like hummingbirds and anybody feels free to call anybody out in the cyber streets and say anything they would never say to a persons face with no facts and no politeness required and stereotypes and generalities are the rule of the day,perhaps it's teenie boppers? i see a lot of OMG and such about the various pop bands of the day but it seems to me most of you folks are extremely informed and well versed in the field and the bands you discuss|`|TZTJRrM4aa	Exactly.     but if somone asks "Omgg, watt rr Fall Out Boysss tourr datesss??? THey aree like my lkike favorite band everaarr and iddkkk how to find tour datess"    yeah go ahead, bash that.    BUT if someone asks a question with GOOD GRAMMAR, without being annoying, even if you dont like the band, don't be an *** about it.    I used to hate this place when i first came here. I liked Hanson, Fall Out Boy, MCR, etc.. and i used to get A LOT of hate, especially for my love of Hanson. I still like all of those bands, but i dont annoyingly obsess over them, which is why i think i am semi-respected here.|`|gDxMoBl9aa	I'm well known as a smartass here, I make no apology for it. I look at it like this, zing Me back, I can handle it.     But Your right about the hatred flowing through this place. And in My opinion 99% of it comes from three sources (And no, I'll not name names) two are current R&Pers one is former, and all three are full to the brim with vindictiveness, bitterness, and hate. And it is their influence on others that causes most if not all of the drama explosions around this place. I wish all three of them would just grow the **** up, take a prozac, get laid or something.    There's My two cents, now lets see if one of them or their minions attacks.    *Edit*  I love Me a good Anti-Tokio Hotel rant, nothing like it!    {{{{HUGSS}}}} Back for Silver|`|BZ1uvtsKaa	this is like asking for world peace. it's never going to happen. but I agree with you though|`|YbmklSzGaa	I agree. The only time I say something bad about a band is if I'm asked my opinion about them. But once I answered a question "What do you think about Secondhand Serenade?" and I answered truthfully and said I don't like them at all. I got about 3 or 4 thumbs down.     But for the main part, I think us R&Pers are pretty supportive and respect each others' opinions.|`|dYyiG90caa	My Experience has been that there have Always Been "Bullies"    There are those on this Site -- Regardless of Age, who Use it to Dominate and Oppress others --    Most likely because they are Shallow, Useless, and UnHappy, People in their Own Real Lives.    They need to come here -- to Fell Superior.

kdlWcH3zaa	The names are an agreed to alphabetic list that is made six years in advance. Each year the lists alternates between beginning with a male or a female name. Each name on the list then alternates between male and female names. The name is assigned as soon as a system reaches tropical storm status using the next name on that year's list. Names beginning with the letters Q, U, X, Y, Z are not used.     There are separate lists used for the Atlantic basin hurricanes and the Eastern Pacific Hurricanes.    If the entire list is used in a given year, they will name the storm after the letters of the Greek alphabet.     The hurricane names are decided upon by a committee made up of members of the World Meteorological Organization and the National Weather Service. The names are common to the regions that are affected by the those hurricanes.

I would love to see them live one day(:|`|ZpnSka8Baa	They're pretty good.  I like Untitled. And I'm Just a Kid.  I prefer their older music to their newer music.

U8QQkeQ4aa	lol everybody is a "marrying" kind it is really all about how you and him can work out your differences.    My husband is my super-opposite.      He is a Virgo and I am a Gemini.  In every book ever written about our compatibility...it is generally really negative but we have GREAT communication.  That is the key to marriage.    However, since he is an air sign, like me, I would definitely show him a lot of patience.  Air signs are enthusiastic, capricious, emotionally detached, adaptable and free-spirited.  They may see marriage as a fence in which they cannot go play where they want to.  Doesn't mean that they are a cheater...but as an air sign I know how that feels.  Compromise, listening, communicating your feelings will be the very best thing for you both :)     Libras are actually very romantic people.  I have a Libra friend and even though he is older and not married, he actually is looking for his "one and only" and he is very sincere and fun loving.      9/26:    Highly creative and classically romantic.  Because his imagination is so active, his talents can often find an outlet in art. He is a natural peacemaker and may feel extremely uneasy if trapped at the location of an angry dispute.     Mentally, he is flexible, understanding, and sympathetic.  He will go through great efforts to try and experience the other side of a situation.  he will try to adapt to point of views.  However, he can be very indecisive.     Emotionally, he is rather impressionable and tends to fluctuate in his feelings.  He may be cold and objective one minute and cuddly and romantic the next.  He may at times with his moods be fickle, inflexible and stubborn.    basically, he is an idealist and a romantic.  He seeks perfect love that is intense, consuming, and looks good to the outside world.      Because of the Venus rulership this week, love may be a troublesome area because of his tremendous need for shared experience.  Libras of this week also brings about these Libras intense depressions because they have a difficult time integrating the various aspects of their personalities.  Often, at the deepest part of them, they seem ambivalent which blocks a more complete sense of satisfaction and happiness.      He needs to set himself a tremendous amount of discipline because Libras have the tendency to over spend, over-indulge and may end up rising to his own discontent.  Often it is good for him to be among someone who has their feet firmly on the ground (like an Earth sign).      Libra's I have noticed, tend to really get along with Cancerians and others of their own element.  That doesn't mean that it wouldn't work of course :)     If you tell me what your sign is, then I would know what your hardships would be.  Mine and my husbands are very correct and I think because I know what they are, we have been able to work on them together and use our strengths and weaknesses to our advantage.|`|rXl4VLMJaa	i did his birth chart. This will tell ALL detail about him. Its very thorough.  Trust me it will talk a lot about marriage with him and how he is.  Hope this helps!

With the heat and humidity going away, the evening and night skies are clear to look at the stars.  The Milky Way stretches straight overhead, heading off to the south - southwest into the constellations of Sagittarius and Scorpio there the stars Antares and Shaula (hmmm-where have I heard that name before) sit above the horizon. Sitting very high in the sky is the star Vega with thoughts of Eleanor Arroway traveling across the universe and the movie and book 'Contact' comes to mind (Carl...you are missed).  Along the Milky Way one finds the star Altair and thoughts of the civilization of the Krell from the movie Forbidden Planet stirs up memories.    But most of all, the constellation of Cygnus the swan (The Northern Cross) brings memories of happiness and sadness.  A goddaughter named Justice renamed the star Albireo 'Bobbie's Star' after the loving brother who gave his life to save hers...and now she too has joined him in the heavens and walks along that trail of stars.    Even though some of the memories are sad, good memories of friends come to mind, here on Earth and in the heavens, so that is why Autumn is my favorite season.|`|k1Aio2qdaa	fall....when the leaves change & it starts getting chilly!|`|4MJEWCjiaa	Winter....I LOVE the cold!!!|`|bxEAWGIoaa	salt and pepper.........seamanab x|`|p0hWsIO7aa	Summer is my favorite too!|`|seUPwrAOaa	Snow....|`|AA10485685	I think I like spring the best as the trees flourish with green foliage, lovely flowers surge up out of the cold earth to show their beauty, and warmer temps come again.

Soon they get to the top of a dune and the second person points and says "look a bacon tree!!"  There is a tree there with bacon hanging from it.  So the first person runs down towards it, halfway there he gets shot dead but there is no one there.  So the second person runs down towards the tree and he gets shot too.   He collapsed and the third person runs up to him and says "What happened?"   The second person says "Run!!

The doctor, shocked that a woman has three vagina's, asks to see them for himself. True to her word, she has three vagina's; one on her left thigh, one on the right thigh, and one in the pelvic area.     The doctor, now curious, asks "Why would you want two of them removed? I would have thought you'd enjoy three set of multiple orgasms.".    The woman replies "Yes, like any woman, I love the multiple orgasms.But I hate getting screwed left, right, and centre."|`|Lh6pnwqHaa	PUDDIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIING!!!!!!

Not wanting to ruin his reputation or his marriage, he paid her a large amount of money and asked her to go back to Italy and have the child secretly. If she stayed in Italy to raise the child, he would pay child support until the child reaches the age of 18. She agreed, but asked how he would know that the child was born. To keep it discrete, he told her to send him a postcard and write "Spaghetti" on the back so he would know when to send the money. One day, he came home and his wife looked quite confused. The man asked her what was wrong and she said you got a very odd postcard. He said give it to me I will explain later. He turned around started reading it, turned white and then fainted. On the card, it was written:    Spaghetti, Spaghetti, Spaghetti, Spaghetti, Spaghetti  3 with meatballs, 2 without   Send extra sauce!|`|J9WgG8RTaa	CHICKENPOT, CHICKENPOT, CHICKEN POT PIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

qsuYKa3naa	There is a government group called OSHA that should be able to help you at least make the place safer to work.  Immediately start wearing your face mask and document everything you experience from now on.

Best of luck to you|`|NPwOxS3eaa	Start wearing a mouth mask.|`|7769bb12a9339d6add718a4ad2b9363caa	If it's true, then quit cause eight ppl dieing a year is more than criminal negligence......i would get together with other ppl and talk about this.|`|9QYAW437aa	start wearing a mouth mask  and hope that you haven't been affected    GOOD LUCK|`|ebr1JAlSaa	Hey Weenie! Well, I guess you could start wearing the mouth mask, but if ur still worried about having/getting cancer, you could go to the doctor and have them check. I think they can do that. If you don't like either of those suggestions, then you could tell ur boss that it worries you and ask to be moved to a different part of the company. Since  you've been there for 3 years, he might let you move. Hope I helped!  ?/Cati

You can't really compare the two, though, since they're about completely different things.      Anyway, I'm definitely much more of a Lost fan.  The story just sucks you in with all it's twists and turns.  I love how complex each character is, how they each have their own muddled and complicated pasts.      I also feel like there's just a bit more originality to Lost than there is to Heroes.  Yeah yeah, I've heard the argument before that Lost is just another one of those stranded-on-an-island things, but it's definitely carved it's own little niche in the more recent seasons.      One thing that really bugs me about Lost is that the show presents more questions than it does answers.  I don't know if that really makes sense, but I just feel like by the end of each episode I've received no answers but I definitely have more questions.

f639092fc925bbd55e7b6272eeb17334aa	1. It adds legitimacy to Bender's story that his father beats him.    2. It shows the Bender is smart enough not to get expelled for hitting a teacher.    3. It shows Vernon is the type of teacher who abuses his power. Up until then Bender is a smart mouth looking for attention but nothing you have to threaten with physical violence. Vernon shows that it is not all about the students. the teachers have some thing to do with the violence.|`|28ZCfGWIaa	He was tempted to fight the principle but knew he had to resist the temptation.

The Others- Nicole Kidman really good film, it's strange but really                     gets your mind into the movie.  errm that's ll i can think of at the moment but they are all really good films i strong;y recommend them if you haven't seen them.  the number 23 had me and my friend ridiculously freaked out by the end of it!! that was funny to think back on :D  i hope this helped and ui hope you enjoy the movies!!  xxx  edit* I just remebered two more:  Dead Silence - Horror/psychological  resally good                              ending, i'm scared shitless of                             ventiliquist dummies so this really freaked                             me out. advance warning :D  and     Magic - Anthony Hopkins another ventriliquist movie                VERY psychological!!  again hope you enjoy :D    why the thumbs down i was simply answering a question|`|Z6tqdAoGaa	Hide and Seek...good twist at the end.|`|zUUDmVbbaa	Se7en.|`|dl3oWHigaa	hard candy will make you crazy        not joking|`|h6wDmUMWaa	Saw there are 5 parts      http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|CVDPXVq0aa	Donnie Darko|`|2QuGuphYaa	Freddy got Fingered!

She can't write!     ~ALL of her characters are Mary Sues: Bella is perfect except for her one "flaw", which also makes her perfect (and oh my god she's SO annoying)  ~Edward is flat and personality-less  ~Their "love" is unrealistic and doesn't seem to have any basis in real emotion beyond physical attration  ~Her writing style is mediocre at BEST (although she has a tiny vocabulary and mis-uses a lot of words, which makes her seem like she's trying to sound smart but it's having the opposite effect)  ~The plot is essentially a bunch of lame cliches all rolled into one bad story, and sooo cheesy: "I stared without breathing across the long room, into the dark eyes of the hunter, and he looked pleasantly back at me."  How can you even read that sentence without busting out laughing?  It's total cliched cheesy crap, like a bad rip-off of a vampire story  ~And who ever heard of sparkly vampires?  Are you kidding me?  That's their big secret?  That they're sparkly?  How much more lame can you get?!?      Also, when people compare Twilight with Harry Potter, I want to strangle them.  Seriously, they have NOTHING to do with each other.  And, J.K. Rowling can actually write!|`|FYT97XLgaa	I hate it.    1. It has wayy to many plot holes.  2. OME (oh my edward) EDward!!!! omfgg!!   3. Edward cullen is a rock. bella loves a piece of granite.  4. unrealistic  5. too vague  6. the main characters include a stupid b*tch and a human disco ball.|`|OHKh0nMyaa	hated it!|`|e1d902a1e3f67c79f0006f242202774daa	i used to like it.. but now people are so wild about it so i'm a little neutral.|`|nEBDfgCOaa	its ok- its overrated|`|0537bcfc65bf84d976530137630ac41faa	I used to like it till it was shoved in my face all the time by everyone and now im kinda over it.|`|MA3KcLUJaa	I dislike Twilight.  Dislike.  Dislike.  Disssssslike.|`|MDsUNZIHaa	i hate it!!!!!!!!                i hate it!!!!!!!!          i really hate it!!!!!!!|`|apvqcpEFaa	I liked it way before it got huge & became this big phenomenon. I still like it, contrary to most of the original fans abandonment. But I am annoyed by the 12 year old girls wanting to marry Edward, a fictional character. They don't seem to comprehend that Edward, a Vampire in a book & movie, is not actually Robert Pattinson, & that he is a separate person from Twilight. It just gets annoying after a while.|`|tzhYaNxvaa	I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!|`|feEeBCW4aa	Hate.  Eh. Teenage girls are so annoying.|`|a7eac91813fb8bcaf83520858e07ada6aa	Books are good, movie was okay, but i can live without the tee shirts, jewelry, posters....|`|woBYNa74aa	i love the Twilight Saga  the movie could've been better though    ?|`|AnIgXRcJaa	Yeah Robert is ugly without the makeup and colored contacts, eww. Sorry girls, makeup isn't every thing.     But the books are decent. I like the way she writes, I can really get into her books.     :)|`|W76Lzh3caa	Well people have different opinions!|`|Y4UF3kWxaa	i just like the idea of becoming a vampire. but the vamps in twilight seem like *******.|`|aAj4dSyuaa	I happened to enjoy the Twilight saga. I thought it was very good. The movie I guess was pretty good for a teeny - bopper movie.|`|QpPzXqIVaa	wow, you hate robert pattison? why? not that you should love him because he's edward or anything but i'm curious...    i like twilight, despite the haters. the book was entertaining and the movie was as well. it's not the greatest work of literature that was ever written, but hey, did the author ever say it was? i like the characters, especially jasper and alice :) but i can't relate with Bella and I think she's kind of stupid, actually. but overall, a nice read, and fun to talk about with friends.
ZTVmUb4Laa	I think you are talking about "Sliders." Great show. They didn't need a crystal, they needed a timer to know when to "slide" to the next dimension. The show was about them trying to find their way back to their own dimension.     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliders  http://assets.hulu.com/shows/key_art_sli...    [edit]  If I am wrong, just ignore me. I'll go away.

It's not what you'd call romantic but it certainly deals with nostalgia, rememberance and sadness.    I won't take the time to explain what it's about as you can easily find that on the Internet Movie Database or Wikipedia but I think it'll be an interesting twist on just another "love gained, love lost" movie for whatever project you want it for.|`|JCJVi8Qraa	Check out Once Upon a Time in America.|`|nKE2qZe4aa	paper moon, nostalgia anyway|`|S71MT9USaa	"Forever Young" with Mel Gibson, Jaimie Lee Curtis, and Elijah Wood.

Edit: I want to add "Kate & Leopold" to that. It stars Meg Ryan & Hugh Jackman and gave me the feelings you described above, as did "Forever Young".|`|Ph3VrLikaa	"visit http://www.hiindians.com/entertainment/m... to get list best online movie websites at one place.

wG7e2ZB7aa	Yes I am not emo either but I love that movie. It is great and really makes you think about love and the steps we take to get it and the steps we take to get over someone.|`|h1Fel940aa	it's good. So are Stranger than Fiction and American Splendor. They're movies that make you laugh and cry... alot.|`|lcS4OmZxaa	try Wuthering Heights with Lawrence Olivier, 1939.

BzP0JX1caa	Let him know how you feel about him, THEN give him space to think it over. Tauruses need that space when it comes to working things out with in themselves.|`|xUs56AwOaa	Definitely confront him about it, but don't push it.  The Taurus can't handle much of an overload of confrontation. He may react negatively to the confrontation at first, even. But they do take in everything you say, so, yes, give them time to think about it afterwards.  And don't expect it to be too soon.  That really varies upon the person.|`|hrGuLYVnaa	first talk about it with him so he knows.....then give him space
tfVFRxjaaa	No, the manga hasn't revealed what he found until the latest chapter. In Chapter 343-The Gluttony, Ishida appears and saves Orihime from being killed by Yammy. He does this by causing Yammy to step on a land mine, given by Mayuri, specifically designed for Arrancar. I'm not sure he got it from Szayel's research lab, but it would be strange for Mayuri to already have something like that since the Shinigami don't know that much about Arrancar.|`|2sIwoqRGaa	This hasn't been revealed yet but many fans speculate that the outlines look like the two former espadas defeated by Ichigo and Ishida.    Mayuri could then use these for his own experiments and ideas to help in the fight against the Espada and Aizen.    This is just the main fan speculation and may be completely wrong but you haven't missed anything and I hope this gives you some ideas.

Carla is originally upset, but at the end of the episode realizes that Turk was trying to do a nice thing, and that now they can talk privately to each other when J.D. and Elliot are around. <br>  <br>  They end up commenting in Spanish that Elliot and J.D. will probably be back together in two weeks, as the pair appear to be getting closer than they have been in the past years.

AA10508807	Dumbledore was already dying as the result of having put on the Gaunt ring/horcrux.    DD also wanted to avoid Draco ripping his (Draco's) soul from killing DD and had asked Snape to kill him rather than let Draco murder DD.      Finally, Snape had made the Unbreakable Vow w/Narcissa, Draco's mother, to fulfill Draco's directives from Voldemort in the event Draco was unable to kill DD.|`|Rc4Chlw3aa	Snape killed Dumbledore because Dumbledore had been wearing a Horcrux of Voldemort's, which caused a dark curse to penetrate Dumbledore's body. Severus told Dumbledore that he only had a year to live, and so agreed with Dumbledore that he would kill him - so he looked like he was on the Death Eater's side. Voldemort chose for Draco to be the one that killed Dumbledore, but Severus did it instead - Draco couldn't do it.    Snape was a hero! |`|QMYNDtHgaa	Because Snape and Murder go hand in hand like Hermonie and Ron..no wait, that doesn't go hand in hand.  That's just awful.|`|PwYnVjWbaa	He didnt|`|d6nyFSW6aa	If my memories are correct.. It was because Dumbledore had to be killed at that moment(it was all set out)..which was "Harry's job" to do which he couldn't so Snape killed him.|`|8121b1525c66181c4572752bd945c5c0aa	he kills him because he had to prove lord voldemort that he is loyal to him.Dumbledore touched a ring that was cursed by voldemort ( or something like that) and he had just a few days to live so he told snape to kill him so he could still protect harry potter. cause snape was protecting him. hope i helped

Modern African American culture is degrading to all blacks and everything it touches. Pornography may have it's place, but there must be a clear line between what is acceptable and what is not. We understand porn taboo, and regulate it's sale and display. Yet, we allow the ideals of modern black culture to be freely broadcast through all channels of media,corrupting or children, blurring our social boundaries, and destroying our values. I urge anyone who reads this to boycott all black media, and products using it to advertise; don't accept the glorification of drugs, violence, and rape.|`|3e9ebbe8a2e15ebeec3eb42bbac62aadaa	and that's important because...?|`|AKwebzdUaa	LOL!!!

PW1vXqruaa	Being a big fan of musicals since I was a kid(yes, when dinosaurs ruled the earth)I would have to say that West Side Story encapsulates some of the most dynamic dance sequences ever put on film and deserved to sweep The Oscars that year. The changes rung on the original script made so much sense that in subsequent college,high school and other amateur productions, "America" and "Cool" are performed as they were in the film with no detraction from the plot.Ok, Natalie Wood wasn't up to the demands of the singing,but she brought something wonderful to the part of Maria and Richard Beymer never had a better role before or since. George Chakeris and Rita Moreno,along with the rest of the cast make The Dance At The Gym one of those kinetic masterpieces that never get old|`|7ZlM9pqEaa	Step up 1 & 2  Stomp the yard  You got served  Dirty dancing|`|n1isLwzDaa	Dirty Dancing.. hands down|`|dgJ4LQG6aa	Another Cinderella Story|`|Z0nooDxDaa	I would have to say Honey, which stars Jessica Alba, it has such a great story to it and i cant get enough of watching it!|`|787CvOA2aa	the step up movies|`|fZXYWPIyaa	i think dirty dance is a good dancing movie if u like romantic its the one to choose its old style and perfect defintly your best choice.Dirty Dance is the movie's name.

e87cd8e8c653d0f68402573b2d9f3ef1aa	I've seen a few trailers for Repo but the only song I remember hearing during one was a remix of "At the opera tonight" and "Zydrate Anatomy".    Just rent it from a local video store or try a Peer 2 peer site.    Repo [was made a a low budget, no real support from the producing company - lionsgate and is the movie vision of a stage play that's been around for about 10 years] is about the not-so distant future where plastic surgery becomes an obsession andnecessityy [like a fashion statement] it all started from a plague that attacked peoples organs [I forget what but the beginning of the movie is done like a comic book for about 10 mins to explain why this is]  Pretty much the movie revolves around [awesome] weirdness of this reality and the main character Shilo trying to explore the world she can't really see.  I can't explain furtherwithoutt ruining the movie.. it's alot of fun =) Bloody mess and beautiful/hilarious music.    And yes.. Paris Hilton is in this.. and No she's not terrible.. Everything she does is exactly as Amber Sweet would've done had she been real in that reality.    Seriously.. there's alot of awesome music.. you could try http://www.repo-opera.com/secretdownload...

c4dFGEERaa	hah i have that same guitar.    you gotta buy a book called Fastrack: Guitar    It has several riffs and practice excercises that have tremendously helped me in learning the guitar over the past 3 years. In the meantime, I would continue to practice scales. different types of stings never helped me, but I would recommend trying a few types of picks to find out which one you can play fastest with.     rock on haha|`|l4ZQchFkaa	Practice! I know it sounds redundant but Just keep pickin that L.P. even if you get bored! Lighter strings are a little help but practice practice practice will do the trick. You'll find that when you can shred that epi. Les paul, when you pick up a  real quality axe it will be like a different world ( like butter )!|`|RbmVnoozaa	what most guitarists do for recording their shredding is use a string dampener. to cut out all excess buzzing from other strings when your moving up and down the fretboard fast.  instead of blowing the money on an actually dampener, you can tie and piece of cloth on the first fret.

So your question should be:  Is anyone else getting annoyed by lame white people that keep listening to hip hop about pimp's, ho's, money, and bling and making it popular?|`|3e9ebbe8a2e15ebeec3eb42bbac62aadaa	indeed i am not  i hate how a lot of people think that all hip hop is about is pimps and ho's  i havnt heard many songs lately bout that  but maybe thats jus me...|`|HzXH5NiIaa	i luv hip hop nd i really dnt care wat anybody gots to say about it.  since ppl want to say they hate hip hop.  then im goin to say I HATE ROCK!:)|`|fe5ad3909e715e24dd1e5b4dec8b1448aa	rock and roll just screams in your ear and play the guitar (at least the songs i heard)  all the rap you have listened to just talks about pimps and hoes|`|bd1fcb5d764c68e35c6336cba1138542aa	Not really.    I listen to music I enjoy and I don't stress about the music I don't enjoy.    I suggest you do the same.|`|xeEOTsyYaa	Go listen to the Jonas Brothers Band then.|`|LyauFqaaaa	wrong section. you mean the rock n roll drugs booze tattoos and suicide?|`|BuOHv2XKaa	I think Modern Rock is annoying.  Like Emo and Alternative, they all sound similar and they are just power chords being strummed back and forth over and over.    At least like 50 Cent uses Violins and Kettle Drums in his songs, Modern Rock only uses Guitar, Bass Guitar, Drums, and the occasional Keyboard which can bring a little varitey into a song every now and then.

CrAwmz65aa	The only way I can interpret this is that you have the rhythm and counter-rhythm written on a one-line staff like the staff that a percussionist reads, and that the instructor wants you to transfer those rhythms to a five-line staff.    If the rhythms are already written on a five-line staff, then I don't know, and most likely the other students don't know.  You can do the other students a great service by asking.|`|vsy4QMHMaa	I have no idea what you have so far, but it seems likely that he/she wants you to turn your rhythm into a melody.    You sound a lot like my daughter: "I don't understand what the teacher wants ....     .... well, why didn't you get that cleared up before you left the class?
0o8csqmuaa	he knew the law and broke it.    So thats what happens when you break the law.    You know some people are calling him a snitch because of the time he is getting, people with felons who have a gun usually get a whole lot more time than what he is getting.    Supposedly he said he had good *** lawyers and blah, blah, blah.   Maybe thats true, maybe its not.    The point is, he aint really tripping about it, if you listened to his c.d, you would know he had a choice. His choice was to carry it because he felt he had to protect his life and he knew of the consequence if he got caught and he did.     So he's being a man about it and gonna serve his time. Personally I would of just got a body guard, but hey whatever.|`|ZQCX1O4zaa	he wasnt found in da street wit guns he tried to buy illegal weapons....n its bullshyt imo|`|2pxGPcxaaa	I'll be listening to his music till he comes back|`|J36Rc5DKaa	he is? why?|`|EY0wnkh3aa	Honestly I mean he was found carrying guns on the street and you can't do that... so I think that maybe prison may be a little tough I mean it wasn't like he was going to kill someone and he has kids so idk. But he can't get special treatment for being a celebrity because I hate when that happens seriously. My cousin will probably kill me for saying this because she is seriously so In love with him it's crazy, but I think he gets what he deserves even if that's jail.|`|70503cfcfc1323e870ead31c66f98600aa	why? i thought he be there  and on home arrest|`|ebvNEvj1aa	He should go to jail. Will miss him..but maybe when he comes out he'll drop a better album...|`|AKwebzdUaa	again?!|`|61SotWlzaa	Yep it's true. I wouldn't really care much but I'll miss more of his music! He'll be out before the sentence is over anyway, famous people never go to prison for long.|`|3e9ebbe8a2e15ebeec3eb42bbac62aadaa	i kno for 30 years or something!!!  but im gonna watch his new show road to redemption  it had something to do with guns again  at least it's only a federal prison...but still  it sux|`|nFiv4hXzaa	yeah he is for 1 year but he's gonna come back with a kick @ ss album!|`|d8aW4fFNaa	He's not in the hood any more, he doesn't need guns. Send him to jail|`|Dwyfm0Ljaa	Honestly i think that yea him goin to prison is ok a lil bad for ppl dat lyke him....but yea he was caught with things that were illegal so therefore he must suffer the consequences like everyone else|`|99bd966c7128c1d9a029f3a0e433e089aa	TI did some careless things that led to the law catching up with him & by him being a felon it was naturally gonna make it manditory for him to be punished worse than non-felons.    But yeah here are my thoughts on this whole situation. TI is on top of his game now & has been making hit after hit for years now. There ain't no stopping this dude. & I don't think this petty lil prison term he's bouta have to serve isn't gonna have any effect on his fame. When he gets out, I guaruntee he'll be ten times as famous as now. For real lets think about it...when TI goes to jail his songs will still be playing on the radio for at least 3 months after he goes in. By the time all his songs hype goes down, people are going to have started to miss TI & anticipation for his release will grow then when he is finally released people will be like "He's Back!!!" & start lovin his music again & by the time he gets out he'll prolly have an album already written and ready to be recorded in the studio, so that'll only add to his fame. So overall what I'm tryna say is that this negative situation will only become more positive in the long run for TI.|`|xYCOEk26aa	I don't think that he should because, I mean yeah he ha those guns but that aint nothing major

The "stairs" scene from The Exorcist.    I've heard people say that the film is too dated to be scary but for me the '70s special effects just make it even more frightening. I actually felt light-headed the first time I saw it, I think I was about 14.    A lot of modern horror movies rely on making the audience jump which in my opinion isn't really scaring them. It's true that modern audiences are harder to frighten but I do think the art of truly scary films is somewhat lost in favour of shocking them with graphic violence or as I said making them jump.|`|8iAOasaxaa	I was 5 or 6 years old when I saw the movie  "Forbidden Planet"  The end where the invisible monster is melting the steel doors  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNhCHjew3...|`|R5I5Znlmaa	The Descent is a really good horror film.

Z91ePgTsaa	They both lived. You can see Kingone with the woman who loved him (the one with the messy curly hair coz forgot her name), but they're not together.     At first I thought that The Devil (Mike He) was dead when Jia Di went for the box with the secrets in it, as she walked right through him, but then it happened for real. He's alive and will spend the rest of their life together, as his wish was.
qDctmJTeaa	Well i've defiantly felt confused after every scene lol.    I think the episodes are good. Not amazing but there are some good little parts like when we found out that guy from the others camp's name was Charles Widmore. I think they could've added on to that more.. it's like every time you find something big out they just leave it and make you wondering & wanting to know more about it...    more questions !    I think it's adorable that Desmond's son's names is Charlie :].

q82cqg3raa	He left Backstreet Boys. Now he's also an actor and a composer. He starred in the musical Chicago on Broadway.      This is from Wikipedia:    In June 2006, Richardson left the Backstreet Boys to pursue other interests and "move on with the next chapter of [his] life." He issued the following statement on the band's website on June 23, 2006:    "After 13 years of what can only be described as a dream come true, I have decided that it is time to leave the Backstreet Boys. It was a very tough decision for me but one that was necessary in order to move on with the next chapter of my life. Howard, Brian, Alex (A.J.) and Nick will always be my little brothers and have my utmost love and support. I would like to thank the Backstreet fans for all the beautiful memories we have shared together and look forward to including you in the next phase of my life. I wish my brothers continued success and look forward to their new album."|`|SLeX0gGaaa	They are still together?|`|p8qneQhmaa	No he left, theres only 4 now|`|af4772f173ca267b8f3a8a7329ca035aaa	No he is no longer with them.

I found this;  CBS says pop star Taylor Swift will appear on an episode of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.    Swift will play a teenage girl whose family manages a seedy Las Vegas motel and who undergoes personal changes that have tragic consequences. CBS didn't announce the air date for the CSI episode.    The 19-year-old country crossover singer was 2008's best-selling artist, with more than 4 million albums sold. Her sophomore effort, Fearless, debuted at No. 1 and includes the hit single "Love Story."    CSI, which airs at 9 p.m. Thursdays, says goodbye this week to star William Petersen. Laurence Fishburne has joined the series as a new forensics investigator.|`|y3jRbaTQaa	Late Febuary, Early March!          love csi

AA10531094	Watch what you eat.  Try a bland diet until the stomach pain goes away.  If you have ginger spice, make a tea as hot as you can drink it and that will settle your stomach.  If not, try Tums or Peptol Bismol.    For relief of constipation. . . heat up prune juice like a tea and drink it as hot as you can.  That should get your bowels going right away. If there's no relief. . . see a doctor.  There could be something serious going on.

Horrible isn't it? It makes you so vulnerable. It opens your chest and it opens up your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up. You build up all these defenses, you build up a whole suit of armor, so that nothing can hurt you, then one stupid person, no different from any other stupid person, wanders into your stupid life...You give them a piece of you. They didn't ask for it. They did something dumb one day, like kiss you or smile at you, and then your life isn't your own anymore. Love takes hostages. It gets inside you. It eats you out and leaves you crying in the darkness, so simple a phrase like 'maybe we should be just friends' turns into a glass splinter working its way into your heart. It hurts. Not just in the imagination. Not just in the mind. It's a soul-hurt, a real gets-inside-you-and-rips-you-apart pain. I hate love.    Love me when I least deserve it, because that's when I really need it.          The reason people find it so hard to be happy is that they always see the past better than it was, the present worse than it is, and the future less resolved than it will be|`|YUcRvlneaa	Thanks for the  |---  |-----------2 Points--------|||"|""\__  |__________________|||_|___|)  !(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)

m0K1X70kaa	Yes!! The movie was so good! It was a bit far from the book though. :[ But still really good! I think they did great on picking the actors!     My favorite character is Jasper Hale. He was so mysterious yet helpful! He is just amazing!!    Yeahh!! The books rock!! ;]    My favorite book is a tie between Twilight and Eclipse. Twilight because it is the beginning and the originals are always great!! Eclipse because it tells Jasper's story! It's so amazing! Also, I really like the epic fight scene! It rocks!! ;]    I liked the book better just because I could make any character the way I wanted them to be according to the book. A could let my imagination create a whole different world inside that book. But I have to give my props to the movie-it was really good! The only way they could've made it better was if they followed the book entirely!|`|jsS03HSNaa	I have read all the books, and my favorite was New Moon.  For my favorite character, it's definitely a toss-up between Alice and Jacob.  In my opinion, the movie was excellent and served the books justice.  (I heard the New Moon is supposed to be released by November in theaters)|`|GNkR9R8baa	I like Edward Cullen because he is so hot! I like the movie because is was different from all the movies I have seen. Also it wasn't a cheesy romantic movie. It had good actors in it. I have read all the movies. I like Twilight best because it showed how amazing falling in love is. There isn't anyone trying to convince Bella that they would be better than Edward. She isn't confuse who she wants to be with forever. I like the book better because it has more details than the movie. Also it is longer and the movie leaves some really good parts out from the book.|`|1e6eca30bdd2eb772df216bfd70b9ca4aa	My sister first read the twliight series a long time ago, when it first came out.

So now, I like twilight they way I would like being set on fire alive.|`|QCbztg1Gaa	i think my favorite character is emmet  i have read all the books  hmm...i think twilight or new moon is the best book even though jacob gets kinda boring in new moon and its sad  ...  i do like the twilight movie but the books are always better  can't wait till the movie new moon comes out!|`|26ygzBVkaa	I LOVE the movie.  My fav characters are Alice, Jasper, and Emmett.  I like the movie because it was based on Twilight (Obvious!) and the actors that portrayed the characters were amazing and portrayed them so well.  Yes I have read the books.  My favorite book is Breaking Dawn and Twilight. (Sorry couldn't chose between them.)  I like the book and movie the same.|`|PzaJO1Ekaa	No  none of them  it'sointless  don't bother  neither  don't want to|`|f83f43c581db1234e5bac01ee41c75e1aa	Yes I liked the movie alot!  Jasper and Alice! There both different! :D  Its different from any other movie I seen.  Yeah I am.  The first one book.  The book it explains more! :D|`|cqIoQH8daa	I thought the film was okay.  I liked Charlie I guess.  I read the books, I liked the last book the best.  I liked the books better.    :)|`|em0wuHyGaa	Edward Cullen  because it is adventurous  yes except the fourth  the first, from chapter 18 to the end  book  ha ha i love the series i got a lot of people reading the series now!!|`|RXHFUDFSaa	of course i love edward but it's a close call between him and alice as my fave characters, not sure i can pick lol    i do like the film, quite a lot, though only saw it 4 times at the cinemas, would like to see it some more...think my mp3 player may be sick of the soundtrack too lol    i've read the saga and adore it completely :)    my fave would have to be...ooo i can't decide, please don't make me :) lol    i like the book better coz it explains more and i love the details :) but i like the movie coz it means i can see it with the prettyness of edward and alice...but the book is awsome :)|`|1q71tyszaa	-yuh i did like the movie, they did the best they could.  -in the movie...i liked them all dang! edward,charlie,and jasper...i cant choose.  -i liked it because i thought the actors really portrayed the characters well, especially rob pattison and kristin stewart.  -duh i've read the books!  -i liked eclipse and breaking dawn the best. i like eclipse cause i can relate to bella in that one, and breaking dawn because you get to read jacob's point of view.  -book you kidding?
OUVwbazhaa	You should figure out what subgenre of electronic dance music you like.    Trance:  Tiesto  Armin van Buuren  Ferry Corsten  Sasha  Digweed    House/Electro House:  Crookers  Digitalism    Drum n Bass:  Pendulum  Spor  Black Sun Empire    Hardstyle:  Zatox  SMF  The Prophet    Hardcore:  Angerfist  Evil Activities  Nosferatu  Endymion    Psytrance:  John 00 Fleming  Infected Mushroom    Happy Hardcore:  Hixxy  Scooter    Techno:  Lautsprecher    Here are some of my favorite songs but I tend to like the harder styles of dance music:    Hardcore:  Art of Fighters - Artwork (Commonly mislabeled as Angerfist - Art of Fighters)  Angerfist - Terror of my Speedcore  Angerfist - Megamix    Drum n Bass:  Pendulum - Tarantula  Pendulum - Slam  Accidental Heroes - Precinct 13    Hardstyle:  Zatox - Bad Time  SMF - Hahaha  Pila - The History  Anything by Ganjaguru    Trance:  Tiesto - Dance for Life  Tiesto - Adagio for Strings    I also like a lot of DJ Satomi but not really sure what genre he is. Two songs from him are Castle in the Sky and Hung Up.    Also, if you are feeling adventurous check out some dubstep. Most people don't like it but some people fall in love with it. Some dubstep artists are Caspa, Rusko, Kromestar, Fullness, Dubtraction, TC.

yOmC5DfCaa	yeah that movie was way over-hyped! way too long and not much direction|`|aYNoQvfMaa	I didn't think it was long, but it's meditations on life and love were just wrong. It knew not of what it was talking about. It's a film made specifically for awards, like The Reader, but unlike The Reader it wasn't a good film.|`|cqIoQH8daa	I really loved the film, but it's definitely not for everyone.   Some bits could definitely be seen as slow moving and tedious.  People are also finding "holes" in the script- I guess it just depends on how you regard the psyche of the characters etc.|`|zSXbDHE2aa	Brad Pitt sucked as always. His fake accent had to make me laugh.|`|sSIRGd33aa	I agree, everyone I know that has seen it hated this movie. Myself included. It was so long and nothing happened. I think the only reason it has done so well, and been over-hyped, was because of the unique movie topic and Brad Pitt. They could have done more with the movie and essentially made it better. I realize it was based of off a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, but seriously how many other book turn movies have they manipulated to make them better?|`|BjXiGRVYaa	the title alone reeked so why expect the picture to be a good one.|`|wdxTxXHOaa	i didnt like it    here's my review    http://www.imdb.com/user/ur12054840/comm...|`|fO6depqaaa	I agree a little bit with you.

yYAabiSLaa	"Think of me" technically isn't an "opera song", but rather a musical theatre piece that was written to mimic arioso style.    As for the recommending of actual rep, it is EXTREMELY important that you tell us what voice type you are ( and your approximate level of experience), so that we can suggest music that suits you. Ill-fitting repertoire will not only be difficult for you to sing, it also runs the risk of injuring you vocally.|`|22GMiNzaaa	Somewhere over the rainbow    Phantom of the Opera    Think of Me|`|LXbtBIf1aa	I LOVE the song "Lilium".

BKrqlGz4aa	Well she was at the premier for the animated movie Star Wars The Clone Wars so I would think that answers your question.  It would be a little stupid on her part to "diss" the role that put her on the map.  Up until ep I her best work was in "The Professional" and while she did a really great job in that movie there really wasn't anything else of note until after ep I ... the roles she has had since then wouldn't have been offered if it had not been for Star Wars.    May The Force Be With You ...|`|L1EccMeZaa	I don't think that could be true.|`|ETWQ3SaPaa	I don't think so...you should ask her. She was in 3/6 of the Star Wars movies so I don't think she hates it.|`|aYNoQvfMaa	She was in all three of them, so, I'd say no, but I really could care less.|`|59hy5EYCaa	no, i don't think so. where did u hear that?
BKrqlGz4aa	Well it isn't actually Warner Bros. that is "producing" the Clone Wars ... LucasFilm Animation is producing it ... Warner Bros. is the outlet for the production.  Yeah I know ... that's on the "nit picking" side of things but that's what I do best ... lol ...    Anyways, Lucas moved from Fox to Warner Bros. because of the connection to The Cartoon Network ... it is owned by Warner Bros.  as is TBS, TNT and many other networks.  Lucas did this in anticipation of the animated series and is looking at TBS and/or TNT to be the home of the live action TV show that is supposed to debut in the fall of 2010.    I'll be honest ... I was asking myself that same question for the longest time until I realized the connections with the TV networks.  Gotta say though that it doesn't quite feel like a Star Wars "thing" without the opening Fox theme but the quality of the story that they have put out is definitely reminding people of just how good Star Wars can be.    May The Force Be With You ...|`|59hy5EYCaa	I think it's a separate thing. maybe 20th century is too expensive?|`|CY0uWjnlaa	Rupert Murdoch, the owner of FOX, closed down it's animation department when the films they made in the late nineties, like TITAN A.E., flopped badly at the box office, so there were not enough potential avenues for publicity and profit/cost return for George Lucas with FOX for THE CLONE WARS series-WARNERS were the best company available to showcase Lucas's series, though they ultimately did a very lame job promoting the first animated THE CLONE WARS film worldwide last summer...

AA10262086	A floyd rose is a tremolo bridge. The only thing different is that the older style tremolos , say from the 50's and 60's, would only allow you to depress or lower the notes you were playing. The floyd rose is a floating tremolo system which allows you to lower or raise the pitch of the notes. By the way, there are many different models of floating tremolos available but the floyd is probably the most popular right now , especially among hard rock or heavy metal type players.|`|sH8qGnsoaa	floydrose is the name of the bridge...you can attach a "tremolo bar or arm" to the bridge and add the 'wammy bar' effect to your playing...go watch any "pantera" video on youtube... or maybe "hendrix"  this should explain what it is

bsnnEsp5aa	REC (romance, comedy, slice of life, josei)  Fumihiko Matsumaru is a salary man who works in the marketing department of a snack company. As a bachelor, he tried to date a girl from his company; but coincidently, he met Aka Onda, a rookie voice actor, instead. Through another stroke of fate, Akas house burned down that very night. With nowhere to stay and no family to aid Aka, Fumihiko took her in; and the next day, Fumihikos new marketing idea was accepted, and Akas being hired for the products voice actor! As the relationship of Aka and Fumihiko deepens, the more difficult their relationship becomes. Can they live together under the same roof while keeping the secret of their relationship safe?    NODAME CANTABILE (romance, comedy, classical music)  The studious and uptight Chiaki is well-known as the top pianist of his school, and dreams of becoming a world-class conductor like his idol, Viera; but his fear of flying (which makes studying abroad impossible) combined with a recent break-up and dismissal from his piano instructor causes that future to seem both bleak and unlikely. After collapsing outside of his apartment, drunk, Chiaki inadvertently meets a young woman named Nodame who, while quite talented at the piano, is unclean, clumsy, and haphazard. Despite being almost polar opposites, the two begin to grow closer and work, together, to overcome the obstacles in their careers.    HATARAKI MAN (slice of life, romance, comedy, drama)  Hiroko Matsukata is a 28-year old editor at Jidai Weekly. She is a talented writer who strives to provide her readers with the biggest scoops, by whatever means necessary. What distinguishes Hiroko from other writers is her ability to transform into the go-getter Hataraki Man (aka working man), allowing her to write furiously until an article is completed! In addition to her masterful writing ability, Hiroko also cant stand those who dont take magazine articles as seriously as she. Though Hiroko desires romance in her life, her career as a writer is all encompassing. Can Hiroko maintain a romantic life outside of work, or is she doomed to the life of a spinster?    HONEY AND CLOVER (slice of life, romance, josei, art college, love triangle)  Art college: cradle of romance, home of bittersweet comedy. Takemoto is struggling to find his direction in life, while his roommates Morita and Mayama are moving confidently (or recklessly) towards their goals. Enter Hagu-chan, the childlike and beautiful prodigy whom everyone admires and thus the love triangles begin. Honey & Clover explores the pain of first love, the trials of romantic conflict, and our loyalty to those annoying people who happen to be our closest friends    NANA (romance, slice of life, love triangle, josei)  Nana Komatsu is on her way to Tokyo; now she can finally be with her boyfriend after a year of dating long-distance! On the train there, Nana Komatsu meets Nana Osaki  a girl who shares her name but seems to be everything Nana Komatsu is not; cool, street-wise, and a punk rocker. The two hit it off and spend the entire journey getting to know each other, but when they get to Tokyo, circumstance separates them seemingly forever. However, fate is not finished with these two. Whilst hunting for a place to live the two Nanas again cross paths. They decide to share a flat and become best friends in no time. Nana K. must learn to be independent and mature, while Nana O. works on becoming famous with her band; but together, they will learn about love and loss, and the growth that comes with it.    Hope this helps :D (will edit if I think of more :D)|`|AA10784641	howl's moving castle|`|cdFtATpUaa	Inuyasha|`|qedla8hVaa	try love hina|`|PfPkwzmMaa	Try to search these animes on crunchyroll or wikepedia and look at the info    Naruto    School Rumble (there is a season 3 but only 2 eps)    Paradise Kiss    Kuroshitsuji (note: his butler is a demon {no spoiler} they tell u)    Sailor Moon (starts in the 8th)    Peach Girl (they don't ever plan to usually make anime like this u'll love it)    Skip Beat    Kuroshitsuji    Bleach (is in highschool but definitely like no other anime)    Tokyo Mew Mew    Naruto Shippuden (after Naruto)    Yamato Nadeshiko Shichi Henge (is in highschool but this plot like Bleach- {they have nothing in common}-  but it is like noooooo other anime I could find like it either)    Zombie Loan(ok DEF. no anime like this one with some freakin' black rings around their neck)    Fruits Basket     Itazura na Kiss (yrs expand farrr) to like27 14 to 27    Vampire Knight and Vampire Knight Guilty(season 2)   these anime are really good i promise to u! u won't regret at least trying to watch it! especially naruto which u probably think is gay cause i used to think that to now i'm one of their  1 supporting fannss|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	Paradise Kiss.    that one was my favorite.

Probably just means red carpet ..... & events.|`|x59uoIpMaa	They say its not really a compliment to be compared to somebody else, but honestly, if somebody wanted to tell me I looked just like, say, Heather Graham or something, Id be flattered, yes, if that person was pretty (of course Heather is)  but whats truly flattering is if somebody came up to you and said "You are so beautiful." I want to feel like my beauty is my own, not borrowed from somebody else.|`|KABKMLnmaa	They just mean they facial features I guess. It could also be an insult...if the person secretly thinks that celeb is ugly ^^    OR    They really just mean clothing& appearance.

HBK9aIhxaa	They are meant to be a little loose as they are spring mounted. It depends how far the pick-up is sinking down. A few milimeters won't affect it too much, however if you feel the need to adjust it there should be adjustable mounting screws at the top and bottom that set the distance of the pickup from the strings.     The nearer you have the pickup to the strings the louder (and sometimes more distorted) the sound will be. Sometimes pickups are deliberately uneven to enhance either the higher or lower srtings according to the type of sound you want. My guess is that if your guitar was new it has been deliberately set like that in the factory    If your pickup is too loose or makes a rattling noise then take it to a guitar shop to get it adjusted|`|T8B23z2Yaa	you might want to take it to a shop and have it look at.

0p9wHjSWaa	I seriously used to use my boyfriends mach3 razor!  They don't make a Mach3, but when you have thick Mesican leg hair like I do, you need something with a little more gusto than those sissy girl razors.  I liked his so much, I bought myself one.<br>  <br>  I'm back to using sissy girl razors because they are pretty and pink.|`|mUed9bXYaa	i use the mach 4 one... keeps me smoother and more kissable for the ladies lol<br>  <br>  when i actually shave that is...<br>  <br>  wait its fusion not mach 4 lol|`|bYWTE40Vaa	Oh no I have the Gillette Fusion <br>  Whoa! 5 blades!|`|kg6H6HDuaa	I use venus|`|b6SdIw6Maa	ima guy and i use mach 3!<br>  hehe<br>  just shaved this morning|`|3LL1Hb7Yaa	Ha.....weaklings<br>  <br>  I use a tin can lid|`|Cxfi2kOmaa	No not every guy uses one and I don't no if they make them for women, I obviously don't use one.|`|PvlbqhlPaa	no|`|kgFayakraa	I use it to shave my moustache

I think it's a really neat idea.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately I'm at kind of a loss for a song suggestion, but I'll keep thinking.|`|aQcsrgLCaa	This all sounds an interesting idea. Not original but interesting. Keep me in the loop.
nKjAZvn8aa	Um, I would eat thru both of my main veins in my wrists.<br>  <br>  Although, Richard Simmons can be funny.<br>  <br>  But MJ, no thanks<br>  <br>  ~Shae|`|kgFayakraa	OMG IMAGINE IF ME AND MICHAEL JACKON OR RICHARD SIMMONS HAD BABIES|`|d33ff6b12876ab19368e1b44c245857caa	I think that it would be good time!<br>  I'd try to get MJ to sing for me<br>  and RS to teach us some steps to sweatin' to the oldies!|`|naI5hGjHaa	Richard would be hilarious, I could handle it.

Thanks, now I am going to have nightmares tonight. Thhhpppttt!|`|LpZXuTVCaa	Chew my damn arm off. and then beat them with the bloody end of it.|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Wonder how the f*ck I got drunk without drinking, because that would never happen voluntarily...<br>  <br>  I am guessing some people don't realize Richard Simmons is gay and Michael Jackson was accused of child molestation...|`|JWSCTek3aa	Is it Friday already ?|`|0cbe6f50fb5532650f0db3b8257a6928aa	I'd call 911.|`|rLP9wjPtaa	chew through my wrists...

Are you?...<br>  Anyway since all of you say "unless they land in a trampoline"<br>  You'll still be charged of attempted murder anyway....<br>  <br>  Anyway why **naked** cant you dress it?<br>  <br>  But if you think about it If you can clone yourself why kill it?|`|8EnlSE93aa	murder, someone who does that has commited a murder act. if its a twin DNA would prove the two different. but if an exact clone then its different.|`|ZrjGrFwzaa	Murder.|`|ZaIzN1Alaa	lol wow thats just funny well i won't kill my clone i will  have fun with him and at least have my self to really trust lol|`|AA10586732	murder. you're not killing yourself. the clone is not you.|`|LJ0fRcMGaa	if it was a naked clone of me  they would classify it as public abuse!|`|zGxdeUxcaa	Murder, and Why Naked?

Vz5vjAWRaa	I think she really is a dude..|`|eS9nPWqBaa	I don't think she's sexist.<br>  <br>  From a woman who is BIsexual.<br>  <br>  I've come to realize that we are won over my mens' power.  Men as we were taught are supposed to protect and love us and that's what we look for.<br>  <br>  She's saying in the song that if she was a boy she'll do all of the things that men do.  Men have more control over their emotions than we do and its as though they cannot understand how hurtful the things they do are.<br>  <br>  I was always told Men give Love for sex and women give sex for love.|`|H6MT8Z8caa	dude, its just a freaking song<br>  guys sing about girlsall the time so are they sexist pigs sing ing about how  there *** shakes and suck that lollipop hoe all that ****? yeah think back to that. that stuff is way more offensive .|`|4XXa7wBxaa	I disagree... I love Beyonce. there's nothing wrong with the song...

6c0edf1d09f54774177b4387fa1e3686aa	Agree.|`|70At0HClaa	jade believes in god, and christian belief is, to be accepted into the kingdom of heaven you have to be baptised thats why she getting the boys done so they can be together again one day. also she has been tidying up all the loose ends and made a memory box for them with letters for every special birthday and occasion till they 18.taking care of their future and when she said she could die now she meant her childhood  dream of getting married to the man she loves with all her family and loved ones around her. enough slagging her off now whatever her reasons for the choices she made it was her right to make them and should be respected as such.she a good mum and i don't wanna imagine how i would feel at the thought of leaving my son. so she has my respect and prayers.|`|JODVNkU8aa	I agree with you.<br>  Having just read the article, I think the whole thing has just become a huge media circus.<br>  I was shocked at the ad that OK magazine have put on TV and now she wants her kids to be able to talk to her after her death!!<br>  Those poor kids are probably going through hell at the moment, they must be so confused about what is happening.<br>  Dreadful situation.|`|4277201b67af194037740747ba2be513aa	Also, why is she saying that she wants to die now? Surely, she'd want to spend as much time as possible with her kids rather than wanting to die right now?<br>  <br>  I think she's egotistical and self-centered and she should get her priorities right. Money has become her god and kids don't want lots of cash, they need some quality time with their mother - not being forced to watch her marry some adolescent criminal.|`|fOpDOwcRaa	Yes I do believe that the children should have a say in their religion, but at the same time Jade just wants to make sure that her children are going to be blessed before she dies.|`|b49e8d9e5eae5116fe7fbd18594b5942aa	Jade is only doing what she thinks is the wright thing to do for her children......is that not what  mums are for......to care for her children|`|LZyW0VQqaa	I would have no problem with it if she herself was religious but she is not....|`|4ZzLtY9Saa	I do feel sorry for her I truly do but I am sick of seeing her on the front page every blooming day in the sun is this going to go on till she dies?|`|499b2674aceaca4224f1e97ffb73d7f7aa	I don't agree about the faith thingy but what the heck was that child doing sitting in a car, unrestrained, on someone's lap in the front seat?|`|tvF86mRDaa	She's not getting them christened to make money - the news add said she's doing it so they have a relationship with god and can contact her. I think its something she feels she needs to do and its probably partly a reason to have a party so she can spoil the boys and make them feel special before she dies. <br>  <br>  I think this is completely understandable and she's doing it so she can come to terms with her illness and eventual death.|`|9c47da69a9c4d04cf9023b7e758e9f8eaa	Apparently she wants her children to find God (and i applaud that idea) so they may contact her after she dies.

eLT6znkFaa	Lithium salts were used during the 19th century to treat gout. Lithium salts such as lithium carbonate (Li2CO3), lithium citrate, and lithium orotate are mood stabilizers. They are used in the treatment of bipolar disorder, since unlike most other mood altering drugs, they counteract both mania and depression. Lithium can also be used to augment other antidepressant drugs. It is also sometimes prescribed as a preventive treatment for migraine disease and cluster headaches. <br>  <br>  "Lithium" by Nirvana<br>  <br>  "Lithium" is representative of the musical style Nirvana had developed during work on Nevermind, alternating between quiet and loud sections.[8] During the choruses, Cobain adds distortion to his guitar while he sings variations on the word "yeah". After the second chorus, the band plays a bridge section where Cobain sings several lines that end with the lyrics "I'm not gonna crack". After a brief bass interlude, the band ends the song with third verse, chorus, and bridge section.<br>  <br>  Nirvana biographer Michael Azerrad described the song's title as a reference to Karl Marx's statement that religion is the "opiate of the masses".[9] Cobain said the song is about a man who, after the death of his girlfriend, turns to religion "as a last resort to keep himself alive. To keep him from suicide".[10] While Cobain said the narrative of "Lithium" was fictional, he said, "I did infuse some of my personal experiences, like breaking up with girlfriends and having bad relationships".[11] Cobain acknowledged that the song was possibly inspired in part by the time he spent living with his friend Jesse Reed and his born-again Christian parents. He explained to Azerrad, "I've always felt that some people should have religion in their lives [. . .] That's fine. If it's going to save someone, it's okay. And the person in ['Lithium'] needed it."[9]    <br>  <br>  "Lithium" by Evanescence <br>  <br>  In an interview with MTV Italy Amy Lee says:<br>  <br>  “ It's not literal, it's not literal about the drug for me, I've never taken lithium before. It's sort of a metaphor about numbness and happiness and sort of like, it's me looking at happiness in a negative way because I've always been, you know, kind of afraid to be happy. Like with the band and the art and everything else, it's always like I'm never letting myself break through into the happiness it seems like, because it's not cool or something. And describing happiness is lithium, it's like saying 'that's numbness, I won't be able to be an artist anymore if I'm happy', which is hilarious because that's just not true, I'm happy. So it's like this fight within the song of like 'do I do this and get out of here and get happy or do I wallow in it like I always do?' and it's cool because at the end of the song I say 'I'm going to let it go', like I am going to be happy. ” <br>  —Amy Lee, MTV Italy[2]<br>   <br>  <br>  Lee previously stated in an interview with VH1 that she wrote the chorus on the guitar when she was about 16, later filling in the verses while writing The Open Door.[3]<br>  <br>  Despite the many references to letting go of depression and darkness in the lyrics, lithium carbonate is typically used as a mood stabilizer to prevent acute manic episodes in bipolar disorder.|`|RQdFRaANaa	Its also a drug.

tLHM4npxaa	I actually liked it..I know I will get thumbs down but I don't care.. I enjoy his music..He is not near as lyrically talented as other rappers such as Nas..Immortal Technique..or Rakim (Some of my favorites), but the songs are great to thump to going down the road or to dance to in the club.. I think Lil Wayne does a great job of catering to mainstream rap..He has it down to a science..and is making millions..So I can't knock him for that..it does take some level of talent to get where he is at, whether people want to admit it or not...I bought the album and thought it was worth the money..|`|wfZhkZO0aa	Is it going to turn out that you are a Troll and that's not your real picture.

211fb3132ed73b4619f11d053f93f3e3aa	Very random - but consider the times!!<br>  <br>  When this song came out in 1966, there was a widespread rumor that it was about getting high on banana skins. The idea was that you scraped the fibers off of a banana skin and cooked them over a low fire. This was supposed to release the hallucinogenic qualities. Of course, it was never true! <br>  <br>  Definitely check out the link below - there are lots of interesting facts about the song!!

But when he treats his family and friends the same way, he's a ticking time bomb, ready to go off at any moment. Though LaMotta wants his family's love, something always seems to come between them. Perhaps it's his violent bouts of paranoia and jealousy. This kind of rage helped make him a champ, but in real life, he winds up in the ring alone.<br>  <br>  "Raging Bull"is by far the best acheivment by Robert De Niro as "Jake LaMotta" as he wins his 2nd Oscar trophy for this roll and help me through my training as a boxer as well "INSPIRED".|`|trMsK86jaa	*thinks about it*<br>  <br>  probably the thing.<br>  <br>  Because it's bloody Genius.<br>  <br>  edit; i know i'll think of something in about 10 or 20 minutes and say "oooh but that one's sooooo much better" and then resent the fact i put down the thing.|`|fqrE36YSaa	Natural Born Killers.

Normally you'd just snag them all. You are able to snag them in their second stage, such as Bayleef, Croconaw, and Quilava. Um, otherwise, if you beat the game, you can trade the starters/any other pokemon you have in your GBA games, into the gamecube game. (I do that a lot.) If you don't have the games, your best source is to just battle all of the specially colored Cipher people in the Relgam Tower. They are the only ones in the game that have the starters. Save everytime you battle one of the specially colored Ciphers (there are 6 of them, they are Red, Green, Blue, Purple, Yellow, Orange....haven't played in a while, so I could be wrong about the Yellow/Orange, probably cause I didn't need to kill them~) ya save, cause most likely you won't get a second chance. Good luck!

F1FCxnCsaa	Didn't you know?  He's really a giant bird.|`|6BvbfLKvaa	I'm not sure if they're directly because of his song "Majesty Snowbird," but the wings did show up exactly when the song began being sung at tours... I know of no other reason of why wings in particular would be his costume.<br>  <br>  Suf is very into the whole costume thing and I'm pretty sure he doesn't take them too seriously or full of obvious meaning... I'm of the opinion that he wears silly things just to be ironic (like the cheerleading costumes from his Illinoise tour). He probably first picked up the idea from his time working with the Danielson Famile, who are reknowned for their own outlandish, symbolism-laden costumes... although I think they may be serious when they wear them and not ironic.
