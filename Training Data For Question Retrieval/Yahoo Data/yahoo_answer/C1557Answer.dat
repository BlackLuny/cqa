Also, the way you've phrased your question you've seemingly accepted that some people have homosexual feelings.  I'd say if you accept the fact that some people are naturally homosexuals (instead of 'choosing' to be homosexuals), then I'd think it would be difficult to say homosexuality was a sin.    The rest of your question as phased is just what I said above: does sin require doing a deed, or just thinking about doing the deed.

There is nothing intrinsically wrong with being attracted to another person of either sex, or with consensual sexual behavior between adults of either sex.  Sexual coercion, including child molestation, is equally wrong regardless of the perpetrator's sexual orientation or the respective genders of perpetrator and victim.    This question a bit more complicated than it appears, as some people define the word "homosexuality" in terms of attraction to the same sex, and others define it in terms of sexual activity with the same sex.

My husband and I considered having the body cremated when I miscarried our first child, but we decided not to because doing so wouldn't bring the baby back.  Funerals are more for the living than the dead, because the dead don't experience their loved one's grief.     I appreciate the argument that you're trying to make here, but it comes across as crass to those who have actually experienced a miscarriage. To my mind, I lost a baby when I miscarried. Its heart was beating, it was moving, responding to stimuli, and then it died.      Finally, I don't think that pro-choice women are any less likely to feel grief at a miscarriage than a pro-life woman. Your options for grieving are just more limited after a miscarriage than the death of a full-term infant.    ***Oh, and btw, I'm an agnostic, not a Christian.

But if a fatal accident should occur, then you must give soul for soul, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, branding for branding, wound for wound, blow for blow."

What you said about Jesus only being concerned with "his own people" is false. The Gospels portray Jesus as occasionally venturing into Gentile territory and healing people in the process. As an example, in the Synoptics, Jesus drove a demon out of a Samaritan woman's daughter (Mark 7:24-30 and parallels) and in the Gospel of John, he talked to a Samaritan woman in public (John 4), both of which were taboo since Samaritans were often considered half-Jews at best. And PRIOR to the resurrection, Jesus is recorded in the Gospels as saying that the Gospel would be spread throughout the Roman world (e.g. Mark 14:9).|`|OT4SrmDXaa	You can't convince someone to be a Christians. They either choose to be one or not after hearing what one is. God had his reason for preaching to the Jews first. Because God wanted Israel to believe in his son Jesus and show the world who he was. But most of Israel did not want Jesus. The same way now most of the world does not wnat Jesus.|`|lh8Tn02Naa	Yep, I'd say you're pretty much on the ball with this.

He also changed the calender times of Jesus birth and resurrection dates to match the pagan holidays in order to estabilish unified rule of his kingdom !!!|`|y9bbLn7qaa	No it was the fullfilling of messianic prophesy|`|rEDfuU7Naa	Yes, it tells me that Christians and Pagans can both have xmas trees.|`|ATPPWOpWaa	No offense but your 'question' is the product of numerous misconceptions in addition to a complete ignorance of many scriptures and prophesies that Jesus came to fulfill.  Jesus didnt fail at anything and didnt lose anyone either.    John 6:39  And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all that he has given me, but raise them up at the last day.|`|Fpi8im9taa	I'm not sure where you're getting this.

Read the New Testament and ask a Pastor........Seek Jesus yourself and pray for understanding...Consider eternity and the ramifications of unknowledgeable speculation|`|7FPvEWb4aa	Ed,    Your question clearly conveys a bias toward your preconceived position.  However, since you posed the question in the first place, I will do what I can to give another perspective.  I can only hope that you will allow yourself to look at things a new way.    First off, realize that your question would be 'news to the Jews' including Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, David, Daniel, Isaiah, Peter, Paul, and Mary.  And since we mentioned Paul, let's mention the words God led him to pen....    "....for I am CONVINCED that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is IN CHRIST JESUS OUR LORD." (Rm 8:38)    Paul was Jew.  In fact, he was a Jew of the 1st order (Phil 3:5) AND he was convinced.    So here's your problem.  You believe that for something to be True EVERYONE must agree about it.    The only thing required for something to be True is for it to, in fact, be True.  TRUTH does not rely on what you or I believe.  I can believe with all my heart that trucks can't kill me and then choose to step out in front of one only to realize (for the final moment of my life) that 'trucks can kill'.  What I believe does not matter.  What you believe does not matter.  What matters is the Truth. What matters to ME is that I believe in the Truth.    The TRUTH is some Jews were convinced.  In fact, 13 of them (the apostles) ROCKED the very foundations of the world as they held true to what Jesus commanded....'go ye into all the world and teach them whatsoever I have commanded you....'    The only thing your question really proves is the amazing things that very few can do when they let go and let God.    ...Jesus told us the road would be narrow (Matt 7:13,14).  I realize more and more everyday how True He was.    iamnotbut....I know I AM.|`|YAiKlPkMaa	They didn't have the internet or television then, he went as far as His feet would take Him.

The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|yHfsHp6naa	Yes, it tells me he never existed.|`|0ky4Ckf6aa	The only thing it tells me is that you have wasted the only 3 bran cells you had left.|`|dDMOJWxwaa	That he asked, rather commanded, us to spread the gospel to all nations.  He also predicted that the jews would not in great numbers accept the gospel until the last minute so to speak. Christ came into the Jews because there was no other nation or people or culture on earth that would have done that to him, He came to the worst on purpose so of course all others are easier.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Provably wrong on ALL counts.     1) The entire early Church was Jewish.     2) Most people who are neither Jewish nor Christian give NO validity to any of the Succeeding Messiahs , Akiva, Shabbatai Zevi, or the late Lubavitcher Rebbe.     3) The Pagan religion accepts ALL belief.What they martyred the early Christians for is not what they believed (read some history) but what they didn't believe, that's why many were martyred for 'atheism'.    Paganism is pure syncretism. Always has been.    But here is the clincher -- the Gospels you are accepting (and, implicity, the ones you are rejecting) are the ones that the early Church canonized, that same Church that went beyond the Jews on the say-so of Jesus, as they claimed.  Meaining, you are using the 'enemy's evidence'.|`|0vmQNf0oaa	You seem to be ignorant of the fact that all of the early Christians were Jews.|`|7NugugsDaa	"After all, Jesus was only concerned with his own people. It wasn't after his supposed resurrection that he "claimed" to spread the word to all nations, according to the NT"        Glad to know you read the Holy Bible. God Bless.

4644ec1ac391913c8f074e3b205f8168aa	Why would any who have communion with God want or need a sign?      But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:   For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.       Christ died that through Him we may obtain communion with God.      Signs then are for people who do not believe and who do not want to believe. How easy it is to deceive and be deceived by a sign.     ...And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.   And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie.

HxbEnNLQaa	Joshua, there is no crime, no sin or problem that is real with being Gay, and since you are not sexually attracted to girls, you are gay...no big deal. We all like girls, they are great...but if you are born with sexual attraction to guys, that is how it is gonna be in life...stop fighting it and relax...30 million or more people in the US alone are GAY!   As for your parents, it is none of their business who you date or what you do...don't let them find out, and if I were you, that would mean keeping it to yourself until you are out on your own...Don't even think of becoming straight, it will not work, will lead you to greatly hurt another girl, and that is not fair. And no, girls do not want to date a guy who has no sexual interest in them...why would you really want to...unless to hide behind them ...think about it!|`|NQ3eETlYaa	Well...you are what you are.|`|O3k4t0i9aa	Wow. I'm sorry to hear about this. The first thing about your inquiry that pops out to me is that you recognize your orientation to be against God's wishes. That's the first step. The second step...as a Roman Catholic, your priest is required by church doctrine to keep silent all things said in confessional. Therefore, I suggest to you to seek religious counseling from him during confession. He will have better advice for you than most of us on here, as he will be able to help you with this matter spiritually while all we can do is offer advice and wish you the best of luck.|`|WwCVhlGbaa	umm that happens to me once too but just see a lot of girls so your actually into girls.|`|YaqtPUyjaa	For starters, don't listen to catholicism, it will only mess you up more.

Listening to what man tells you his interpretation of what God wants and what you should do only makes things more confusing and makes you hate yourself.  God makes everyone different for a reason.  He loves everyone equally and he does not discriminate.  If you continue to love yourself & God and continue to lead a good life, then you have nothing to fear.  Be who you want to be and love who you want to love.  As far as your family goes, if you really think that's how they would react, there is nothing saying you have to tell them.  Wait until you feel they are ready, or until you don't live with them anymore.  For the most part you need to love yourself first. Gay, Straight, Bi, whatever you are.  Accept yourself and love yourself.|`|14ZGrmZcaa	I think you should accept who you are , it must be hard at first but accept what you want and like, dont necessarily label yourself.

Some adopt locally, some aboriginals, some from foreign countries.  Again let me stress that it depends on the individual families need to adopt.  Nothing in scripture says you must or should.  However, when you consider the principals of the Evangelical they probably would if they could.  It is doing a Godly service to an under- priviledged person.  It is good to adopt those children that are in need.  My wife and I personnally brought up or trained 4 different individuals who were not our offspring.  All from our country but one who was from the Phillipines.  None were legally adopted.  One came from a broken home of alcoholism, one from a home of drugs, one from a very good home but could not agree with her mother (I spoke to the father before allowing her to stay with my daughter) The young lady from the Phillipines was brought here and abused.  she has turned out to be the best young lady I have had the priviledge of knowing.  She was over 20 when she came to our house and our own children were all grown and gone at the time.  I don't line up under the umbrella of "evangelical" however, I an Christian and Protestant but I prefer to say I am inter-denominational.  I can worship with all, teach to all, learn from all and believe we all have some good to share.|`|rEDfuU7Naa	I know a pastor who spent months trying to adopt a girl from vietnam, I bet they did it because they felt like they were converting a vietnamese girl in the only way they could.|`|A9vvZ6eUaa	The numbers are hella low.

WMJwIRGxaa	They have lost their focus, in this respect.    They claim that she is the "mother of God" due to Yeshua also being God.  However, she was merely the mother to the physical form of Yeshua, not to God, Himself.    In truth, Mary (her actual name is Miriam), was just like all of us.  She was born a sinner, rather than immaculately conceived.  She was in need of a Savior, just like every other human being that ever lived.  She knew this, as well.    They also maintain that she remained a virgin after the birth of Jesus.  However, Scripture shows that she had at least 6 other children after His birth.|`|t79pLOCUaa	Because they believe that by speaking to her their prayers will have more impact because a son listens to his mother.

Totally un-Biblical.  But hey, they sure have a lot of fun with it, and there are countless versions of Mary, especially in Latin countries, that are the core of celebrations, parades and festivals.|`|QLDMmp6Taa	Why do non-Catholics who have no clue always show up to answer this question?    The Catholic Church teaches intercessory prayer, and you can read about what that is here:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercessor...    Most Protestant churches teach intercessory prayer, but the Catholic Church believes that the angels and saints in heaven (especially Mary) can pray for us as well as people here on earth.      There are people who believe the lie that Catholics worship Mary without actually checking it out themselves, but there are those who know better and yet continue to spread the lie.  For either type of person the following scripture applies to them:    "You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desire. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies." - John 8:44|`|hR7OsqtRaa	Mary is the most Blessed Woman to have ever lived on this Earth.

There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.

Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6.

We worship the Virgin Mary because she's holy. She had our savior Jesus Christ. She never committed any sin and raised Jesus. Mary is a saint. We are thankful for her because she gave birth to Jesus, and without Jesus no one would have been able to go to heaven. When he died on the cross for us (the Crucifixion), he opened the "gates to heaven".|`|AA11008046	It is part and partial of their beliefs. praying on the rosary and to Mary (mother of Jesus) is a waste of time in my humble opinion.  The Bible, which they believe in, says to avoid vain repetitions.  so if you say 5 hail Mary's you are quilty of vain reps.  Mary although the mother of Jesus, the Christ, is a very special person in the Christian ranks.  However, I believe the Catholics over do it.  Mary is not God.  Mary cannot hear your prayers.  Mary the mother of Jesus is just that and that is all.  Very special lady but not the forgiver of tresspasses nor recipient of prayers.  I have several catholic friends who don't agree with me but that doesn't cause any wars.  we just agree to disagree.|`|LJ6vHfgoaa	If by "worship" you mean "to honor or reverence as a divine being or supernatural power", we don't.

Catholics do not worship Mary. We pray to Mary because there was never a human closer to Jesus than Mary was. We ask her to intercede on our behalf. Protestants often practice intercession--one person praying for another person.   When I pray to Mary, I never feel like I'm exclusively praying to her. Can God not hear me at all times? Why do you think we end our prayers in the sign of the cross? "IN THE NAME OF the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit."

We Catholics honor Mary and ask her to pray for us in our times of need like we ask our family and friends to pray for us. The Rosary is a way to meditate on the Birth through the Resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ. We honor Mary because she said "Yes" to God's Will that she be the Mother of Christ therefore we hold her in a special place in our hearts because of her obedience to God. Worship is for God and God alone.|`|cIZS6Wr2aa	To all of you who say the Catholic church doesn't support Mary worship, why do you not know what your own church teaches?             Here is proof that the Catholic church has proclaimed her Queen of Heaven and co-redeemer with Christ.  Many still pray to and kneel to her or an image of her.  We were brought up catholic and taught to do this.      "In October of the Marian Year of 1954, Pope Pius XII issued an encyclical "Ad Caeli Reginam" proclaiming the Queenship of Mary, and decreeing that the feast of Our Ladys Queenship be celebrated throughout the world on May 31st. (It has since been moved to August 22). On May 13th of the following year, in a radio message to Fatima the Pope explained why Mary is entitled to be called Queen."  http://www.rosary-center.org/ll45n4.htm      Pope Benedict XV said of Mary that [O]ne can justly say that with Christ, she herself redeemed mankind.   Pope Pius IX said, Our salvation is based upon the holy Virgin... so that if there is any hope and spiritual healing for us we receive it solely and uniquely from her. Essentials of Evangelical Theology, Vol. 1, page 196.|`|AA11796124	Catholics don't worship Mary. She, as is with any saint, is venerated; honored, but that does not constitute worship.

The closest thing you can find would be found in the "apal Encyclical 'Lumen Gentium':    LG 50. "...The Church has always believed that the Apostles and Christ's martyrs, who gave the supreme witness of faith and charity by the shedding of their blood, are closely united with us in Christ; she has always VENERATED them, together with the Blessed Virgin Mary and the holy angels, with a special love, and has asked piously for the help of their intercession."    Here is what the dictionary says regarding the words venerate and worship:    VENERATE: "To regard with respect, reverence, or heartfelt deference."  One of the 10 Commandments is "Honor your Father and your Mother." Do you honor your father and mother? Do you respect them? These are the things Catholics do for their parents, and for the Blessed Virgin Mary.    WORSHIP: "The reverent love and devotion accorded a deity, an idol, or sacred object."    Do you worship your parents? Certainly not, and neither do Catholics worship theirs. However, it is perfectly alright to venerate them and for Catholics to venerate the Blessed Virgin Mary.|`|acvRjD6Raa	She is the mother of our Savior Jesus Christ|`|CyUEZBViaa	Do they?|`|3gMytPXhaa	Recommendation to god through mary.

There are 1Billion Catholics.  --- Protestant ministers are converting in increasing numbers :  http://www.chnetwork.org/    -- Anglcanism and Orthodoxy have both produced great champions for reunion -- John Henry Newman  and  Vladimir Soloviev respectively    -- Bible study has given renewed impetus to the Catholic view of Scripture, the very fragmentation you are talking about. I am thinking of questions you see here on Y!A -- How come Luther took 7 books out of the Bible, What does this mean : This is my body, This is my Blood, and the growing recognition that there is a profound difference between the Christian Faith and knowledge of the Bible. (See the section from St Paul below about the conversion of the jailer and his family to see that you could become a full Christian and not even know the Bible at all)     =======================   "The Russian Church and the Papacy" is a powerful defense of the papacy from Vladimir Soloviev, a Russian Orthodox theologian who was condemned by his church for his efforts at Christian unity. Pope John Paul II calls the late theologian Soloviev (1853-1900) one of the modern era's great "witnesses of the faith and illustrious Christian thinkers." Like the Holy Father, Soloviev was committed to the cause of Christian unity, and spent many years attempting to convince his Orthodox brethren to reunite with Rome under the pope. He even had an audience with Pope Leo XIII in 1888 and received a papal benediction in recognition of his efforts. However, Soloviev was condemned by his own Russian Orthodox church for his efforts and was ordered by the Russian government to cease all public activities. It was then that he wrote his great work, "Russia and the Universal Church," which combined a brilliant defense of the papacy with a plea for reunification of the Catholic and Orthodox Churches.    =============================    The Conversion of the jailer      25About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them. 26Suddenly there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken. At once all the prison doors flew open, and everybody's chains came loose. 27The jailer woke up, and when he saw the prison doors open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself because he thought the prisoners had escaped. 28But Paul shouted, "Don't harm yourself! We are all here!"     29The jailer called for lights, rushed in and fell trembling before Paul and Silas. 30He then brought them out and asked, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"     31They replied, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be savedyou and your household." 32Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all the others in his house. 33At that hour of the night the jailer took them and washed their wounds; then immediately he and all his family were baptized. 34The jailer brought them into his house and set a meal before them; he was filled with joy because he had come to believe in Godhe and his whole family.|`|AA11282654	I think it is definitely part of it. Science and education are more to blame with the death of religions, though.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	no christianity will not die as long as it is centered in Jesus Christ|`|tpDICzslaa	I don't think things are quite as bad as you make out. There are thousands of denominations and splinter groups but the vast majority are on the Protestant side of Christianity. This is because many Protestants believe in the sole authority of the Bible and in the right of every believer to interpret it for themselves.    The situation is quite different with regard to the Catholic and Orthodox churches. Because they believe that Tradition is as important as Scripture, and because they have authoritative hierarchies they have managed to remain largely consistent in their beliefs. The various Catholic churches (Roman, Maronite, Chaldean, etc), although varying in matters of liturgy and practice, are united by their beliefs and mutual recognition. The Eastern Orthodox churches (Russian, Greek, Serbian, etc) are mainly united with each other and differ from the Catholic churches on relatively few points of doctrine. Indeed, Catholic and Orthodox christians are close enough that it is not unreasonable to hope for their eventual re-unification.

Instead they use a nebulous definition that is logically circular to the Bible: a kind is anything within the observed bounds of reproductive groups.

The correct vernacular here is species for the animal taxa. Biologically speaking, all species are part of taxonomic status, which can be seen as distinguishable through the use of DNA and comparative morphological methods.    Interbreeding can be classified as species identification; however, in many cases hybrid/crossbred animals are unable to reproduce, through natural biological methods.     Some of those biological methods aside from an inability to breed (as seen with your example ligers/tigons), are short life spans, differences in sexual cues and illness.     As an aside: If an animal is able to overcome the natural biological mechanisms, and can only inter-breed with each other, then they end up invariably creating a new species.     Evolution is proven fact: The DNA mutation that occurs through the process of transcription is still occurring.     This does nothing to prove creationism.|`|ca4d1a722e751ae09dcec4cce410f2dfaa	http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles...|`|D9lMg7A2aa	A kind is what Darwin tries to sell under the name 'species' and fails miserably.

The philosopher Gilson studied Darwin and one objection -- as a reviewer stated it -- is     " A more accurate title for Darwins book, according to Gilson, would be the Origin of Varieties. Darwins use of the word species, however, is contradictory. To say that species are fixed, Gilson writes, is tautology; to say that they change is to say that they do not exist, Why does Darwin obstinately say that they transform themselves, rather than saying simply that they do not exist? (pp. 140-1)      Welcome to the real world.     Oh, and I am not a Creationest, just a person who sees the foolishness of Evolution.

Asking a priest to forgive you, being baptized as a baby, praying to anyone other than the Lord Himself or not eating meat, not wearing make up, or doing other religious acts does not get you to Heaven or any closer to God.  Accepting the Lord Jesus into your heart and know that He is GOD and having a relationship with Him and following the commandments and letting Him take control of your life, that will get you to heaven.  So, it is not about religion it is about having a relationship with Him.  I am a christian non denominational, that means I am not a certain religion, I am a Christ follower and He is my best friend.  I go to church to be fed with His word, not to ensure me a spot in the Kingdom.
pmna8fhyaa	Assuming that these verses do mean what you say they mean, what of it? What is you point?    What I think of these is that they are a bit too vague to be called "scientifically accurate".|`|G9VBTg47aa	Rather, if the bible was made up, who made it? And what could be their goal?|`|0ky4Ckf6aa	Excellent|`|117deabf91c1ed299801ae60363d0378aa	Praise God! :)    He is awesome!|`|B7TFX4wUaa	Okay, let's see how this holds up to even the slightest scrutiny.    The number of stars is less than infinite, and therefore countable.    The speaker in this instance is Job praying to God, so maybe we should be worshiping him instead.    Atoms aren't invisible.  If there were, everything would be transparent.  They are just really, really tiny.    You are misrepresenting medieval science.  They knew bleeding someone too much would kill them.  It's extremely easy to figure out especially if you pay attention while stabbing people with swords.    It says circle, not sphere.  There is a major difference.    In contrast, what does the Bible get wrong.    Grasshoppers have six legs.  Rabbits do not chew cud.  Having goats look at a striped post while mating will not affect their coat.  Species are not fixed  The Earth is not older than the sun.  There was no Flood.  ect.|`|LnoyylQ7aa	there are millions of billions of stars just in the milky way|`|EBGdlo35aa	OK, first, my position:  I am a Fundamentalist Christian with a Bach Sci in Physics.  I just want to point out some possible shortcomings in your argument (since your argument relies on science)...  Please do not take this as criticism!  I applaud your efforts - but the logic or science is a little "short".    1) The Bible claimed that there are billions of stars    No, it doesn't.  Crediting the bible inappropriately is not a good place to start when attempting to convince someone that what the bible says is true.      2) Now we know that there are billions of stars, and that they cannot be numbered.    This is NOT something we know, and most astronomers believe that the stars *can* be numbered.  It will take time and more powerful telescopes, of course...but most do not believe that there are an infinite number of stars.  If there are NOT an infinite number of stars, then (eventually) the stars might be numbered.  Certainly, it is reasonable to expect that they *can* be numbered, whether or not it ever happens.      3) The Bible claimed that the earth freely floated in space.    But, the earth does NOT "freely float in space".  It is true that it is not physically mounted on some platform formed of matter.  However, it is coerced into following its current path by the force of gravity (and perhaps other, weaker forces of which we are unaware).  Here, your point is accurate but your terminology is not.  Make the point that the earth is not supported by matter but, rather, by invisible and immaterial energy.      4) The Bible claims that all creation is made of invisible material.    This is NOT what Hebrews 11:3 says.  This is a plainly intentional misinterpretation of the passage.  What it says (very plainly) is that things were created not from existing material, but rather from nothing visible.  Notice how carefully the author worded this:  not from *something* that is invisible, but rather from no thing that is visible!   The "invisible" from which all things are made is *clearly* specified in the verse itself - the "invisible" is the word of God!  PLEASE do not use this obviously twisted interpretation of a very plain biblical passage in an attempt to prove the bible makes a claim that is very clearly not claimed in this passage of the bible.      5) Blood is the source of life    Obvious to anyone who has ever seen anything bleed to death.  I'd guess that most rural children realize this before the age of 5 - without instruction.  No one needed the bible to tell them the importance of blood to life.  The medical practice of "bleeding" was one endemic to Europe (and its colonies).  Rather than being an ancient practice of biblical times, it is a relatively recent practice of post-biblical times.  Don't assign the stupidity of later people to earlier people who never followed this practice.      6) The Bible Reveals the Earth is Round    Yes - but it does not say "spherical".  Now, it *could* mean "sperical" - or, more likely, it could mean round in the way that the horizon apparently circles you when you look around.  This is no *evidence* of an ancient belief in a spheroid planet.  It *could* mean that - but that is mere conjecture.

It states the Earth is a "circle".  Big difference.    edit~  There are such things as flat circles, and that is what is meant by "the circle of the Earth".  And the Earth doesn't "float freely through space".  If it did, we wouldn't be revolving around a Sun right now, now would we?  Wow, think before you post something.|`|a6f5efb2cbade02a525b433574402dc8aa	1. Rather obvious if you look up into the sky.  2. It's the same claim as the Sumerians who it was copied from, including Tiamat. Science thought no such thing.  3. Atoms are not invisible, they are too small to see, there is a difference, also it was democratus who thought that up about 600 years before, and as the writer was probably a Hellene they would be familiar with that idea.  4. Blood is just part of the source of life, the liver, the brain and the lymph nodes are equally the source of life as we cannot live without them. Meaningless statement.  5. A circle is not a sphere and it was believed to be a flat circle look at the old Hebrew maps, their world was flat with four gates in the sky for the winds, the sun and the moon to come through, see Ezekiel.    I didn't bother looking at the site because if this is the standard then it is all gibberish rubbish. You do not do your religion a great service by dishing out this distorted and badly thought out garbage.|`|mCy1jIEvaa	Thank you Antonio for all those verses. There are plenty more in Leviticus regarding health and Hygiene instructions from God. God told the Israelites that they would not suffer the illnesses which the Egyptians had suffered 'providing they following His instructions'.  The things that he told them to do, in connection with how to handle dead bodies, how to incubate people with skin lesions etc. would have seemed extremely weird at the time but science has proven that all God said was scientifically accurate. No-one at that time would have understood why God told them to do this but they followed His rules in simple obedience and proved Him correct.

4844bb464bfc0bc332975a25bc39a0e7aa	This is no ordinary interlinear: the integrity of the text is preserved, and the English which appears below it is simply the basic meaning of the Greek word. . . . After examining a copy, I equipped several interested second-year Greek students with it as an auxiliary text. . . . The translation by the anonymous committee is thoroughly up-to-date and consistently accurate. . . . In sum, when a Witness comes to the door, the classicist, Greek student, or Bible student alike would do well to bring him in and place an order.From a review of The Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures, by Thomas N. Winter of the University of Nebraska, appearing in The Classical Journal, AprilMay 1974.      I am interested in the mission work of your people, and its world wide scope, and much pleased with the free, frank and vigorous translation. It exhibits a vast array of sound serious learning, as I can testify.Letter, December 8, 1950, from Edgar J. Goodspeed, translator of the Greek New Testament in An American Translation.    The translation is evidently the work of skilled and clever scholars, who have sought to bring out as much of the true sense of the Greek text as the English language is capable of expressing.Hebrew and Greek scholar Alexander Thomson, in The Differentiator, April 1952, pages 52-7.    The translation of the New Testament is evidence of the presence in the movement of scholars qualified to deal intelligently with the many problems of Biblical translation.Andover Newton Quarterly, January 1963.    The New Testament translation was made by a committee whose membership has never been revealeda committee that possessed an unusual competence in Greek.Andover Newton Quarterly, September 1966.|`|LuN1unJ3aa	It tends to be a transliteration and not a true translation. I have a fully footnoted version (very large) and find its notes helpful when I study the actual translations (which the NWT isn't).    A translation translates ideas, which can pose problems because the translator may mis-interpret a phrase and therefore render an inaccurate translation.    A transliteration translates words consistently from one language to another and pays little attention to context. This can also render inaccurate meanings. About the only "translation" in the NWT is the rearrangement of words into our English syntax.|`|u4af7B2Iaa	For one thing, it has God's name printed in it, unlike most translations of the Bible.

The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27.

Catholics confess their sins to a priest and he is supposed to forgive you for your sin..that contradicts Jesus Jesus said through him you ask for forgiveness, man can not cleanse our sins.    2. Catholics pray to or through Saints especially Mary, again you are not to worship anyone above God, and you must pray through Jesus.    3. I feel that during church the Priest never recognizes Yahweh God, and even Jesus said he is not above Yahweh for this is his father too.    4.Belief in the trinity that Jesus is the Father, Son & Holy Spirit...Why and how would he be all 3 in one...just Jesus teachings he profess to HIS FATHER not himself.    5. The history of the Church that thought they had the right to punish people for not following Christ, Jesus even forgave the Romans that Crucified him, so why would the church think they are above Jesus and take matters into their own hands...
HAHDipTAaa	I think your question is asking about a close male contact for whom you feel strong attachment - He maybe rejects you and you want to know more about misogynistic tendencies and if he may be homosexual, also if there is a connection between homosexuality and misogyny.     Some men who are homosexual are definitely misogynists, but I would say they are in the minority.  Maybe there is another reason he is trying to avoid you. Perhaps you are trying too hard or maybe he is afraid you are too young for him and he is giving you a wide berth.

The thought of going to bed with a woman does not repulse me (I do know some Gay men who it does).

WMJwIRGxaa	Nobody is a Christian simply because of the denomination with which they identify.    To be a Christian is to be surrendered to Jesus Christ, & Him alone.  When you are a true Christian, you trust in Him for your salvation, for everything in your life.  You live for Him, adhering to His tenets.    Some who are Catholic are Christians.  They are not so because of their denomination.  They are Christian for the reason I gave in the preceding paragraph.    There are those who are Catholic who are not Christians.  There are also, those of other denominations who are not saved.  It all rests on the personal relationship that the individual has with Jesus Christ.

It is a journey of faith it is the one that will define you.|`|e5d10eae9a48e059f9317d719d5b716caa	"Catholics" are Christians, they just have a lot of old traditions that were used by the Pagan Romans.|`|nsAFlZhIaa	Catholic is a large denomination of Christianity.|`|y9bbLn7qaa	catholic is works based salvation, Christianity is faith based|`|ow2gVYeqaa	No, not the same.    They're as the same as a car and a bicycle.|`|AygQshkcaa	No, they're not the same thing.  Catholic is a branch of Christian because Catholics believe in God & Jesus just like Christians    -Catholic believes that Mother Mary was a virgin and got pregant by the Holy Spirit, to give birth to Jesus, however Christians believe that Mother Mary did "it" with somebody to get pregant.     -Catholics pray and honor Saints & Mother Mary, while Christians only pray and worship God.     There are probably more differences, but I'm not a real expert. Those were just the basics.|`|i6Mi8uWIaa	Not only are Catholics Christians, Catholicism is the oldest and truest Catholic Church.    The Catholic Church is the ONLY church founded by Christ. All Protestant denominations were founded by men.    These men broke away for various reasons. Henry VIII broke away, for example, so he could divorce his true wife and marry his whore.    More often, though, it was because they read something in the Bible that, to them, disagreed with what the Church was teaching, even though the fact was that it in no way disagreed with what the Church was teaching and in fact actually supported it!     Here are some common Protestant claims against Catholicism, along with the facts.    Myth: Catholicism is half-Pagan.    Fact: Truth is truth wherever it is found. The Catholic Church, following St. Paul's example, makes use of existing practices to spread Christ's message. When the Church annexes pagan customs and holy days such as Easter, Christmas, All Souls Day, and All Saints Day, it is simply utilizing St.Paul's evangelization strategy. This does not represent a wholesale adoption of paganism, or some diabolical mixture of paganism with Christianity. If that were true, Paul would stand guilty. Yet he states with confidence:    1 Corinthians 9:19-22: For though I am free from all men, I have made myself a slave to all, that I might win the more. To the Jews I became as a Jew, in order to win Jews; to those under the law I became as one under the law-though not being myself under the law-that I might win those under the law. To those outside the law I became as one outside the law-not being without law toward God but under the law of Christ-that I might win those outside the law. To the weak, I became weak, that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all men, that I might by all means save some."     Myth: Catholics worship Mary.    Fact: Catholics do NOT worship Mary, or the saints for that matter. When a Catholic prays to Mary or one of the saints, we are asking them to pray for us, in the same way that we would ask any living Christian to pray for us, for God is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living, and when we are in Heaven, we are more fully alive than those on earth. We do honor Mary and the saints, however, as those having lived holy lives, just as we might honor a brilliant inventor or writer or diplomat with a Nobel prize.     Myth: The Catholic Church added illigetimate books to the Bible.    Fact: The books of the Apocrypha were not added to the Bible by the Church, but removed from the Bible by Protestants in the translation of the King James Bible.    Myth: Catholics are taught not to read the Bible for themselves.    Fact: Catholics are not only taught to read the Bible for ourselves, but highly encouraged to do so.    Myth: The Catholic Church teaches a "false gospel" of works-based salvation.    Fact: Catholics agree that we are not saved by works. yet the Bible teaches that the true faith by which we are saved is accompanied and validated by works. While Romans 3:28 does teach that  faith saves us, it does not imply faith alone, and in fact the prhase "by faith alone" never appears in the Bible. And, in fact, many verses in the Bible tell us that works are very much needed.    These verses include Romans 2:13, 1 Corinthians 3:8-9, Galatians 5:6, Philippians 2:12-13, 1 Thessalonians 1:3, James 1:22, James 2:14, 17, and James 2:22-26.     If works have nothing to do with salvation, then it is quite strange that in virtually every passage dealing with judgement and God's determenation of whether a person is saved or lost, works are mentioned as key determinants, but faith is not. Even Christ said this. For example, in Matthew 7:19, He said "Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire." Later, in Matthew 25:46, He says "And they [those that fail to do good works] will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.    So you see, what the Church teaches is that works validate faith, and that we must do works in order to justify our faith, but that they must work in concert: faith, work, and grace.    Myth: By calling Mary the "Mother of God," Catholics make mary greater than God.    Fact: Denying Mary her title is to deny Jesus His. To say that Mary is not the Mother of God is to say either that Jesus is not God the Son, and therefore not divine, or to say that the Incarnation never happened, that Christ was never born. Either is blasphemous and heretical.     Myth: Catholics attempt to make Mary equal to God by calling her the mediatrix of all graces.    Fact: A mediatrix is simply a go-between. It is the same as with prayer. When we ask another person here on earth to pray for us, they act as a go-between, and mediator. To call Mary the Mediatrix of all graces is to say that she is the one human being who is truly full of grace and closest to God through the divinity of her Son and the merit of being the mother of Christ.

Then when she asks about the ring it will give you the opportunity to talk to her about your choice.  I find that its best when conversations are naturally brought up to talk with my own mother.  I hope that your mother is proud of your choice.  I sure would be if you were my own daughter.
93galWG1aa	Not sure I follow you, the lambs supper is another term for the Mass more the sacrifice of the Eucharist.  Confirmation is usually administered by the bishop. there is a general imposition of hands, the bishop meantime praying that the Holy Ghost may come down upon those who have already been regenerated: "send forth upon them thy sevenfold Spirit the Holy Paraclete." He then anoints the forehead of each with chrism saying: "I sign thee with the sign of the cross and confirm thee with the chrism of salvation, in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost." Finally, he gives each a slight blow on the cheek saying: "peace be with thee". A prayer is added that the Holy Spirit may dwell in the hearts of those who have been confirmed, and the rite closes with the bishop's blessing.   Jesus promised to send the Holy Spirit that's all I can think of.|`|UL3XOKJxaa	So sad..do you think that God is happy with your rituals? You don't even understand what you are doing...does that make a difference? None of the things that you mention can even be found in God's word, the bible.

Proverbs2:21 indicates those whom conform and verse 22 is the judgment penalty of being outside the Kingdom through sin.    We focus more on the obedience the other is the consequence of NOT abiding and keeping God standards of righteousness and holiness.    If we walk inth elight we are free from the darkness because He protects us.    Again the debate of judgement and failure to do the will of God is what some face.   So in love we try to show them the way.   Jesus said He is the way the truth and the life"    In old times before His coming God always had a standard of righteousness. Doing the good thing God showed Israel saved them from calamity and death.    The scripture in itself when read by unbelievers is enough with prayers to show them the way to go.     Jesus said." preach the gospel because it is the power of God unto salvation"|`|D4LnRg2Daa	Both these assumptions are wrong Jehovas servant.

If you look up his history He is formerly Eddy t p and has other accounts asking the same question too.     Search it out and trust me its all there.     Just type in (female preachers). You will see.     I blocked him when I seen he had asked this numerous times and he got mad that I (immediately) blocked him.       It does not make sense to me.     I do know it makes the rest of us Christian non-Christian or whatever who are sincerely trying to help others look bad, look mental, or have a problem.    This is why I post what I post to him.

1cGlucXyaa	You are right. God knows when are time here on earth will end.|`|xfYUxKmvaa	God doesn't fix football games and He doesn't jam the weapon.|`|c3zUqmdXaa	Each person in this world has the responsability for his own acts. (Galatian 6:7). God has two wills: The permissive one and the directive one. His permissive will happens, for exemple, when someone kill himself. His directive one happens, for exemple, when the gun doesn't work. God, therefore, has no responsability for craziness and mistakes that mankind does, but God has to be praised for each soul who reaches salvation, cause salvation happens only by his directive will.|`|3DjUX8etaa	God knows what will happen in advance, but that is not necessarily because he is dictating it. If God controlled every aspect of life we would not truly have free will. We are responsible for our actions and the consequences of those actions. Even if that means death. God does control certain things that figure into his will though. But, as bad as it may sound to some; your life, my life or anyone else's life may not make that big of a difference in his overall plan.  God Bless!  +?+|`|GVQRrZODaa	According to the bible, god is responsible for both good and evil.|`|U9hrhb4saa	God knows when people die and when people are born, but remember that He gave us choice. whatever we do with our lives we plan completely on our own, but God knows it.

The string theory, butterfly effect, etc.    On a religious stand-point (and I'm not religious), you could say that free will overcomes what god wants you to and wants you not to do. You have a choice to kill yourself, and there's nothing god can or can not do.    If you really wanted to kill yourself, you'd have more than just one option at your hands. Overdosing, hanging, and a minor inconvenience such as your gun jamming won't stop you from doing what you want to do.|`|2D2DM5OOaa	if the gun it doesn't work that's his destiny, that's mean God give him a second chance.|`|2daf1f643b0222e20fe97c10246019f0aa	This is a very deep, profound question that could be discussed and debated for weeks without ever giving a specific answer, but God gave all of mankind free will.  God knows all and loves everyone of us, and some people don't love Him back and take their own life.  Can God intervene?  Depending on religious beliefs, yes He can.  Does He?  Obviously, not always.  Why?  Again, because of free will.  Does God decide when a person should die? Basically, sure.  Then the questions begin: Why do babies die?  Why do good soldiers die?  Why do young kids die?...it goes on forever.  Best solution?  Firmly believe that God loves you and God has and will never make a mistake.  Religion and faith is so important in a person's life.  I know this may not be the answers you'll looking for, but it's the best I can do...I'm only human.|`|R8w7UvQAaa	No, quite frankly, not.  God values free will, obviously.  Thats the reason why we as humans messed up in the first place!  As far wether or not people who commit scuicide can go to heaven, I don't know, and I'm afraid there is no way of telling...|`|YPGBzlE1aa	If by 'God' you mean the monotheistic deity of Judaic origin and if you are American you are asking a question that ultimately led to the founding of the United States.    Deists and Theists are the two primary schools of thought in Christianity.  Theists founded the original colonies and believed they're lives were direct interactions with the divine.  Every word, action and event was God's will and miracles, (as well as witchcraft), were very real.  If somebody died or fell ill it was the direct result of God's will imposed on Earth.    Deists arose during the age of enlightenment in the mid 1700's and believed that, while God existed, there was no direct interaction between God, the Earth, and mankind.  Instead God gifted mankind with life and free-will so every action and consequence of course had a rational cause and a worldly result.  It was the Deists who primarily attended the first Continental Congress and later formulated the Bill of Rights.    So, your question is not about the existence or presence of God but really weather the Theists or the Deists are correct or not.    It should be noted that the argument is raging to this day between evolutionists, (deists), and creationists, (theists), although debate now is tame by yesterday's standards.  In a roundabout way it could also be argued that the disagreements between the schools of liberal and conservative thought are a continuation of this schism which is actually unique to the United States alone and has been with us since the time of the founding fathers.      I.e. no one has settled that question.|`|G9VBTg47aa	Idiocy... how many times does a man bang his head off a wall berfore he realises it hurts... seriously.|`|dDMOJWxwaa	No, that is that person taking their life, not an "act of God, or natural occurring thing, accident or such.|`|AA11282654	Try reading up on cause and effect again.|`|Z5KvRSRCaa	I won't lie, that is intriguing.

God could not be the author of this dark place, I think those who do this are far from God even if only for a short while, Joy and peace are what God gives unconditional love, so no i can't see how this can equate with God's plans for anyone. He knows the end result but without direct intervention it will play out as if it already happened, this is why it's so important to stay close to his teachings.|`|o4zAMlCoaa	God has given humans and angels the ability of free will- that's why suicides are allowed to happen. But suicide is a sin that you couldn't ask forgiveness for because it would be too late.   But I do believe God can change whatever He wanted. It all depends on what He has planned for certain lives.   But God MAY forgive a someone who committed suicide and they didn't know better- but because His Word is being spread all over the world, you are held responsible for knowing what God's Word says.   Hope that clears things up! = )
Fo9ADQLBaa	Where is the love and compassion for others?  Jesus loved everyone, accepted them for who they were.

Thank goodness my family always told us the exact opposite. I used to LONG for the day America could put that behind it. In some ways I guess we never will get 100% of the people to grow the hell up and admit people are people. and they should have no problems marrying the person of their choice.

It's still wrong.|`|IYe1TTwYaa	God does not chang and neither does His views. Those that are not following His word are still deceived.|`|HUXMgyp1aa	I don't think so because there isn't anything in the bible which is very clearly against inter-racial marriage between Christians while there is very strong biblical evidence against homosexuality. Christian thought has changed over the centuries and will continue to change but we are not waiting at the whim of the world in order to for us to know what is right or wrong in God's eyes. Modern society tells us that premarital sex is good, normal, and to be expected. Most people I know consider it a prerequisite for a healthy relationship and successful future marriage. Modern society also tells us that there are multiple ways to God and that we should not force are beliefs on others. It also tells that horoscopes and fortune tellers are harmless. The theory of evolution has been around for quite a while now and yet bible is against all of these and so is the Christianity. There have always been and always will be people who call themselves Christian but do not live by the bible. But there will also be always be a remnant who both call themselves Christian and live by the bible. These people will still believe that homosexuality is wrong just as true Christians today believe that premarital sex is wrong. What may change is how we handle the reality of homosexuality. It wasn't very long ago that Christians were making laws against all kinds of sexual sins but have given most of that up now. Possibly, if in the future same-sex marriage is legalized everywhere and continues to be legal for a century or two, Christians will get over the legal aspect of it and just preach against from a moral perspective.|`|EAuMJrs4aa	its possible even religious points of view evolve over time|`|aV3bFchtaa	Yes.

God's laws are unchanging. When God has said that something is a sin, it will remain a sin. That doesn't mean that someday gay marriage will not be lawful. But allowing something to be legalized doesn't make it right...i.e. abortion, drunkeness, sex before marriage etc. People of faith will not attempt to circumvent God's laws.|`|89MKzLl3aa	I think so.

According to the Bible writers a positive sign of the impending end of times before Jesus return to Earth that hardly any Christian talks about and those who do are totally opposed to it is the FULL UNCONDITIONAL RESTORATION OF SODOM to the way that it was just before its destruction!!! This FACT in the Bible proves that some high profile and politically influential Clergy persons and Preachers are PROMOTING HOMOPHOBIA on their own initiative! They are a bunch of wanking bigots some of them are gay in the closet like Ted Haggard!    Ezekiel 16:[48-49], [53], [55] (NIV) [48-49] As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, your sister Sodom and her daughters never did what you* (*what JERUSALEM did! Most Christians refuse to agree with God that according to the Bible writers JERUSALEM IS FAR MORE SINFUL THAN SODOM EVER WAS...!) and your daughters have done. Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom* (*Christian bigots ought to read the Bible more carefully to find out what was wrong with Sodom!): She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy...* (*Neither God the Father nor his Son Jesus Christ EVER MENTIONED THAT THE SIN OF SODOM was homosexuality! Jesus is making favorable statements about SODOM all along --Mat 10:15, 11:24, Mar 6:11, Luc 10:12) [53] "However, I* (*God) will restore the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters and of Samaria and her daughters, and your fortunes along with them [55] And your sisters, SODOM with her daughters and Samaria with her daughters, WILL RETURN TO WHAT THEY WERE BEFORE* (*this is an UNCONDITIONAL RESTORATION of Sodom. The Sodomites are not called to repent at all!); and you and your daughters will return to what you were before.    Obviously, God is clearly saying that the destruction of Sodom was a mistake, but the powerful Christian Clergy advisers to our secular leaders on gay issues are promoting a doctrine of cruel religious hatred to law abiding minorities!  God created Homosexuality as part of the creation package!    Jeremiah 13:23 (KJV) Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots?...    So the gay and lesbians CANT POSSIBLE CHANGE WHAT THEY ARE!!! The Jewish Bible writers admit that Jerusalem is far more sinful than Sodom! (Is it because of stories like the Priest and her lover in Judges 19-21?) The Bible God is confessing that Sodom and Gomorrah will be fully and unconditionally RESTORED to what they were BEFORE THEIR DESTRUCTION!!! There is no call for repentance AT ALL for any Sodomite before the full restoration of Sodom! Praise the LORD! Sweet Jesus! Amen? I know most preachers HATE THE FACTS WRITTEN IN THEIR OWN BIBLE BECAUSE THEIR INCOME DEPENDS ON GOING ALONG WITH WHAT THE CHRISTIANS OUGHT TO BELIEVE! The Mormons are wising up to this fact, too! Christianity is about the most dishonest and powerful religion in the world second only to Islam!    According to the Bible writers the restoration of SODOM must be taking place right now before the 2nd coming of Jesus!  If so, then there is nothing wrong with the same sex marriages going on in our very days!!! And I wonder why Christians are so passionately AGAINST the fulfillment of Bible prophecies that they dont like. The most popular preachers today are the ones most opposed to TRUE Bible prophecy fulfillment! You must know that the Sodomites were much holier and far more respectful of women than even Righteous Lot was. Lot pledged his virgin daughters to be married to heterosexual SODOMITES who believed in virgin purity until marriage!!! (Gen 19:14) It was Righteous Lot delivering his own virgin daughters for the unrestricted pleasure of some gay Sodomites who were looking for the strange male visitors who INSISTED on spending the night out in the main street of Sodom NOT AT ALL at Lots pad! (Gen 19:2-3) These angels or messengers of God knew where the action in Sodom was at and they wanted to spend the night in the middle of it, but Lot wanted them for himself!  Also, these Guardian(?) Angels didnt know how many people Lot had in his family they didnt come looking for Lot! (Gen 19:12).  Abraham didnt tell them that his nephew Lot lived there. Christians dont pay attention to all the clues written in the Bible! They only know how to feed their traditional homophobic orientation out of this story. Anyway Sodom is destroyed.  Holy Lot lost his wife.  He started to get real drunk and was having sex with his young virgin daughters UNTIL HE GOT THEM PREGNANT! God was so impressed with Lots performance that he bestowed on Lot the Eternal Title of RIGHTEOUSNESS throughout the Bible, Old and New Testaments in triplicate according to the number of the members in the Holy Trinity! Lot was a legal resident of Sodom!    2 Peter 2:7-8 (NIV) and if he* (*God) rescued Lot, a 1) RIGHTEOUS man, who was distressed by the filthy lives of lawless men for that 2) RIGHTEOUS man, living among them day after day, was tormented in his 3) RIGHTEOUS soul by the lawless deeds he saw and heard.* (*this verse in the Bible shows how hypocritical is the Bible! Even the NT idea about sin is not what the preachers and Christian Clergy peddle nowadays!)    BTW Lot was rescued out of Sodom by accident! No angel came looking for him at all! Christian dishonesty in telling the Bible story of Sodom and Gomorrah is a sham! There is no trace of evidence from any other source outside of the Bible that Sodom ever existed. I just stick to the Bible text! It is so disgusting for Bible believing Christians to hurt and persecute the gay community on a fairy tale!  Now a lot of innocent, but Bible ignorant and Clergy obedient Christian bigots are actually preventing the fulfillment of Bible pro|`|19d2b605b1e026eb10b142185a1dcabeaa	I don't believe that.  Same sex people can love each other and live together legally.  But, please, don't call it "marriage".  For instance in France they gave it a different name. They call it PAX.

Now, one problem is with what I call pseudo-intellectuals, such as evolutionists, who accept the dogma of secular government schools without analyzing the data.

It is much more likely that it would depend on their education in certain aspects of academia. Those who have studied the scientific pursuits are more likely not to believe...because only empiracal evidence can be used to prove of disprove anything...and religious beliefs can not be proven with that kind of evidence. For those who have studied the more social areas of education, empiracal proof is not nearly as important as is reasonable theory based on social observation. They will tend to be at least somewhat spiratual in nature.    People of faith have their own proof that God exists....i.e. have experienced a personal relationship with him.

You will find the vast majority of doctors, pilots, servicemen, and more have a very strong belief in god regardless of IQ, and doctors are not exactly stupid folks.  I cannot answer what percentage of Christians hold high IQ's but I know a number of Theologians who are way above the average in their IQ rating.  As for a club for outstandign IQ'd folks - I am not sure.  I hope not.  God did not bless man with intellect to  sit in a fancy club and look down on the rest of God's creation.

In fact, it's a combination of many different variables.     Ed Gein for an example. He's a serial killer, who was taught by his mother that all women are senseless whores (including herself), and he was not allowed to have any friends. He was completely isolated from the world.     But then, so was his brother. But his brother moved away when he had the chance, made a life for himself, and became a functioning member of society. Ed Gein? He became a mass murderer, who used human skin as lampshades and kept human skulls and shrunken heads around his house.    Why did one brother become a sadistic, psychotic murderer, while the other became a functioning member of society?    You hear many times that people are the product of their environment. Personally, I think being capable of something like that is a combination of your environment, and who we are originally.

The reason they can not understand God, is because they deny him.     This is what God says about them in his word, the Holy Bible:    Rom 1:18 But God shows his anger from heaven against all sinful, wicked people who push the truth away from themselves. [fn]         Rom 1:19 For the truth about God is known to them instinctively. [fn] God has put this knowledge in their hearts.         Rom 1:20 From the time the world was created, people have seen the earth and sky and all that God made. They can clearly see his invisible qualities--his eternal power and divine nature. So they have no excuse whatsoever for not knowing God.         Rom 1:21 Yes, they knew God, but they wouldn't worship him as God or even give him thanks. And they began to think up foolish ideas of what God was like. The result was that their minds became dark and confused.         Rom 1:22 Claiming to be wise, they became utter fools instead.     1Cr 3:19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness to God. As the Scriptures say, "God catches those who think they are wise in their own cleverness."     Isa 29:14 Because of this, I will do wonders among these hypocrites. I will show that human wisdom is foolish and even the most brilliant people lack understanding."      1Cr 1:18 I know very well how foolish the message of the cross sounds to those who are on the road to destruction. But we who are being saved recognize this message as the very power of God.    1Cr 1:20 So where does this leave the philosophers, the scholars, and the world's brilliant debaters? God has made them all look foolish and has shown their wisdom to be useless nonsense.   1Cr 2:14 But people who aren't Christians can't understand these truths from God's Spirit.

I do not believe I can make it more simiply than that.    Ha, and please try to reframe from saying Atheist have solid proof to support their beliefs.

These are just depriving yourself of things that you like as a test of one's own willpower.  The so-called fast of muslims is not a real fast either because they simply switch around their day and eat when others a sleeping and go without food when others are eating.     The longest I have truly fasted has been 2 days and I felt really ill at the end of it. I don't think that God intends us to be ill though this and He knows us all individually and knows all about our health. I believe He expects us to use common sense BUT when He gives someone the desire to really fast for long periods He seems to give them the strength and willpower to do it.|`|N0ed8LCwaa	people have come close but they usually end up dying.    the story in the link below happened where i live.|`|jVPd8kJMaa	If you are referring to fasting in the bible, you are in error and you do not know the scriptures nor the power of God.

Jesus said, when you fast, don't do it like the hypocrites. If your question is to find real answers, then your best bet is to find out exactly what Jesus said about fasting in the Holy Scriptures.  If your job is to ridicule it so people with itching ears can listen to you, then congratulations. Your job is well done.|`|R8w7UvQAaa	One person comes to mind in specific:  Liu Zhenying.

There are other factors in the equation. You have hear of emotional intelligence? EQ? When you decide something it's not just empirical 1+1=2 at work.

He said to the woman, "Did God really say, 'You must not eat from any tree in the garden'?"  The woman said to the serpent, "We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden,  but God did say, 'You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.' "  "You will not surely die," the serpent said to the woman.  "For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."  When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it.  Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.  Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the LORD God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from the LORD God among the trees of the garden.  But the LORD God called to the man, "Where are you?"  He answered, "I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid."  And he said, "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?"  The man said, "The woman you put here with me--she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it."  Then the LORD God said to the woman, "What is this you have done?" The woman said, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate."  So the LORD God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, "Cursed are you above all the livestock and all the wild animals! You will crawl on your belly and you will eat dust all the days of your life.  And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel."  To the woman he said, "I will greatly increase your pains in childbearing; with pain you will give birth to children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you."  To Adam he said, "Because you listened to your wife and ate from the tree about which I commanded you, 'You must not eat of it,' "Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat of it all the days of your life.  It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of the field.  By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground, since from it you were taken; for dust you are and to dust you will return."  Adam named his wife Eve, because she would become the mother of all the living.  The LORD God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them.  And the LORD God said, "The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever."  So the LORD God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken.  After he drove the man out, he placed on the east side of the Garden of Eden cherubim and a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life.  that is why the earth is not a paradise!

Science proves a creation regardless of the "theories", which are just that, theories.      But the bible thumpers should plant their faces into the book AND into science,  if they want to give an intelligent answer or rebuttal.    Did you know, this is one instance only, that science has discovered the furthest/oldest star to be 13.6 billion light years away, and that the universe is ever expanding.  Scripture, indeed, can prove this same thing.  It is a matter of reading the truth unhampered with your own preconceived christian(usually christian)  fallacies.

Who created the particles ? I can keep going on and on.  Answer : Humans are not real since there is no evidence of their evolution.  Would you accept the above argument. ?  If I tell you Who Created God, then you would say Who created the one who created God and it would go on and on.  We know God is real, since we are real. If you deny God, then you have to deny your own existence, which is impossible. No matter how knowledgable or intelligent you are, you cannot deny that there has to be a supernatural force that has created our planet and our body and, that creator is God.    In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|TLLklriUaa	Not only do I accept that some people believe in a god or gods, I am friends with many of them.

Some Christians can be open minded but I hardly see any on here. They will ask questions about evolution or something and I can tell they don' t read the answers because they just pick a fellow Christian saying "evilution is dum" as best answer.

To an atheist the idea of a God, for whatever reason, seems completely impossible.

I accept ideas and concepts that have evidence supporting them.  I criticize those who refuse to accept basic concepts that are well supported by evidence.   A large percentage of those people happen to be Christians.    Faith assumes its own conclusions, and defends it conclusions from all arguments to the contrary.  Faith is belief without proof, it never changes because it can't, and faith by definition cannot determine the truth of anything ever.      Science is the exact opposite.  It assumes nothing that hasn't been supported by evidence, it changes with new evidence, and it changes as new information comes in.  A person of good faith never changes their beliefs regardless of the evidence or outside pressures (see Abraham).  A good scientist will change his conviction completely when faced with solid evidence refuting his hypothesis.  Faith is conviction without evidence, science is evidence without conviction.  Faith declares the truth, whereas science actually seeks the truth.      Assuming the supernatural has never improved our understanding of anything.

But people really do think he's making kids go round shooting people or something. That is absolutely ridiculous. Musicians like him have been around for years (Alice Cooper for example) and what they do is entertain in a way that shocks parents, because kids like that. So what? A lot of kids feel like they don't fit in. Someone like Marilyn Manson is a spokesperson for those kids.    I think that if parents have an issue with a musician who turns out to be smart and in touch with their kids better than they are, it's their problem for not understanding their kids.|`|2FTaKXz3aa	Because Christians believe that freedom is a wolf in sheeps clotheing.|`|Blajij6iaa	I didn't know anyone still cared about Marilyn Manson?|`|bK5MJCxhaa	I know he's funny looking.

I don't care if someone else loses their life, or it's basic necessities, as long as I get to live how I want!    Many men have died for another mans freedom.  So what is fair?      People need to stop believing everything they think.  We are our own worst deceivers.|`|6737bc1385aaa269c889b6f7c3e1c1e7aa	You've never heard Manson talk behind the show curtain, have you?|`|Tledw3eAaa	I don't know that people see him as evil as much as they simply see him as very distasteful. I mean, he did choose a nickname ending with Manson because it belonged to a serial killer. He chooses to mock religion in some of his video's, which even without that element are a bit dark to begin with. That, and a lot of what he does is purely done for theatrics and is meant to get a rise out of others.    He portrays himself in the same way he is often perceived. While I might not consider him evil, I don't exactly feel sorry for him if others see him as this. It's not like this perception is something he is trying to avoid in the first place. Being in favor of freedom doesn't necessarily mean you speak out in favor of it in a tactful and respectful way. He chooses to express it a way he knows offends others, and so no one should be surprised (as I'm sure he isn't) when people get offended.|`|q2KfJ4JDaa	Christians hate people that openly admit that there is no god, because it hurts their cause.    I really think Satan was a freedom fighter. I mean, all he did was disagree with god and was suddenly he is called "evil"    "I'm not a slave! To a god! That doesn't exist!"|`|TinNG7k7aa	He's apparently a very intelligent person and he sees the hypocrisy in people and in society.

l9RDuthbaa	Lexing (identifying parts of sentence) Hebrew is hard because prepositions get attached to nouns, and in many occasions there's an ambiguity between a preposition attached to a noun, and another word (e.g. ???? can be both "for Saturday" or "to sit") and can only inferred by the scope (and even then - not always).  I didn't come across any grammar checker in Hebrew.

Here is the above quote in context of the Catechism of the Catholic Church. -- by the way this answer is itself an example of what I mean by 'question faith' :    Faith and understanding   156 What moves us to believe is not the fact that revealed truths appear as true and intelligible in the light of our natural reason: we believe "because of the authority of God himself who reveals them, who can neither deceive nor be deceived".[28] So "that the submission of our faith might nevertheless be in accordance with reason, God willed that external proofs of his Revelation should be joined to the internal helps of the Holy Spirit."[29] Thus the miracles of Christ and the saints, prophecies, the Church's growth and holiness, and her fruitfulness and stability "are the most certain signs of divine Revelation, adapted to the intelligence of all"; they are "motives of credibility" (motiva credibilitatis), which show that the assent of faith is "by no means a blind impulse of the mind".[30]     157 Faith is certain. It is more certain than all human knowledge because it is founded on the very word of God who cannot lie. To be sure, revealed truths can seem obscure to human reason and experience, but "the certainty that the divine light gives is greater than that which the light of natural reason gives."[31] "Ten thousand difficulties do not make one doubt."[32]     158 "Faith seeks understanding":[33] it is intrinsic to faith that a believer desires to know better the One in whom he has put his faith, and to understand better what He has revealed; a more penetrating knowledge will in turn call forth a greater faith, increasingly set afire by love. The grace of faith opens "the eyes of your hearts"[34] to a lively understanding of the contents of Revelation: that is, of the totality of God's plan and the mysteries of faith, of their connection with each other and with Christ, the centre of the revealed mystery. "The same Holy Spirit constantly perfects faith by his gifts, so that Revelation may be more and more profoundly understood."[35] In the words of St. Augustine, "I believe, in order to understand; and I understand, the better to believe."[36]     159 Faith and science: "Though faith is above reason, there can never be any real discrepancy between faith and reason. Since the same God who reveals mysteries and infuses faith has bestowed the light of reason on the human mind, God cannot deny himself, nor can truth ever contradict truth."[37] "Consequently, methodical research in all branches of knowledge, provided it is carried out in a truly scientific manner and does not override moral laws, can never conflict with the faith, because the things of the world and the things of faith derive from the same God. The humble and persevering investigator of the secrets of nature is being led, as it were, by the hand of God in spite of himself, for it is God, the conserver of all things, who made them what they are."[38]|`|C1SOqQSkaa	I've seen many people in religious debating groups start to see the light.

FGcwxZz0aa	The invisible Church are those who have faith in our Lord but one cannot discern who are a part of His invisible Church. However, Jesus and the disciples founded a visible Church and we see the formation of that Church in the book of Acts. This Church is the Catholic Church and is the self-same Church that Jesus prayed that we would all be one within. Otherwise as professed Christians and not being obedient to His Church would place us outside of His will, blessings, promises and grace; if not fully but in great measure. Those outside of His will would be those that some describe as "playing" at Christianity and not following Jesus.    There are some outside of the visible Church which some call a "remnant" that are not be on the path to the narrow gate but may be saved by God's mercy. These are those who seek God but are deceived into being outside of His visible Church by no fault of their own. While not a part of the visible Church they can be considered a part of the invisible Church. So, Jesus and the disciples formed a visible Church as we see after Pentecost recorded in the book of Acts and it could be said that there are those known only to God who are a part of that visible Church against their will or knowledge that will be received in Glory to be a part of the Church Triumphant. But, as one can see in Scripture this is not the ordinary way to be saved through His Church but as an extraordinary example of His mercy.    The gates of hell will never prevail against His visible Church because of the protection of the Church by the Holy Spirit given at Pentecost. The Church is other worldly and heavenly in its nature and is endowed with its holiness and veracity from its founder Jesus. Jesus gave His promises to His visible Church so that the world could see the testimony of His Church as the pillar and ground of the truth and a shining city on a hill (Mat 5:14) It is the will of God that all should be saved by and through His Church as it is the Church that was commissioned to spread the Gospel throughout the world both corporeally and individually. The Church is a refuge and the Ark from the sins and temptations of the world. It is heaven on earth where Christ dwells in the Tabernacles and is worshipped. So if the visible Church ceased to exist it would make Jesus a liar and a pretender as the Messiah and Savior of the world because all of His promises would be proven false.    Unity requires that there be a knowledge and physical manifestation of that unity. That is the Catholic Church which is the visible Church. The invisible Church does not represent unity because it is known only to God which may be unified in faith but not in purpose.     The purpose of the Church is its testimony in spreading the "good news" to the world. That requires a visible unity. The world will never know if those who are in the invisible Church are preserved but the visible Church will always be the witness to the world that it remains after empires and governments have fallen, political ideologies have been born and died and false and counterfeit religions have come and gone. It is a testimony that Jesus is God of the Trinity and that His will be done on earth as well as in heaven regardless of the snares of Satan and His lies against humanity.    In Christ  Fr.

Because Protestant Christians don't believe that Peter was the rock that Christ built his church upon. We believe the "rock" was Jesus Himself, the fact that He is the Son of God.

Yes, I have been saying this for years now, 'why all this division, is God a divided God, would He arbitrally bless one while sending another to hell?' No He does not!!!    Jesus only founded One Church, and all the disciples and the early church belonged to this One Church. The Apostel Paul had much difficulty maintaining this truth, and even after witnessing the lies that were slipping into the true church, said that this what they were listening too was no gospel at all! (Galations 1)    This Church of God believed in the authentic gospel of the water and the Spirit, and because of this everyone of them became sinless and holy and were righteous before God.  Can we say this to these so called Christian Churches today? No we can't!  For they are filled up with sinner Christians. Is God pleased with this..NO!!!!    Here, let me guide you to more truths, just order your Free Christian Books at this website. In these Free Christian Books you will read just where the Church went wrong and what gospel they are believing in, and what gospel God originally gave to mankind.    I have read these answers, but God will say to them, "Who is this that darkens My counsel with words without knowledge?"    Everyone of these people do not believe in the original gospel of the water and the Spirit, for they also portray this division by their many confusing words.      All true born again Christians who believe in this true gospel of the water and the Spirit have the same faith, the same Father God, the same baptism, and the same Holy Spirit.|`|18f23c8e100103ef2ddb3c61fe1e09e3aa	Do I detect a bit of Catholic bias in your question?  That's fine, as long as that bias doesn't allow you to twist the facts.  Martin Luther is NOT tied to the Lutheran church!  Martin Luther and those of like minds are tied to Protestantism, the root word being Protest.  Yes, Martin Luther took a stand against the gross distortions of scripture as perpetrated by the Catholic church.  When the church would not address Luther's painstakingly documented grievances (because of their own ego and audacity) then that left Luther and others with only one choice: A new church.      So, think of ALL Catholics, be they Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, etc. as under this umbrella and all Protestants, be they Lutherans or Methodists as LOOSELY under the Protestant umbrella.      The trouble is this.  Luther aimed at nothing more than to reform the Catholic church.  Again, no Catholic to this day dares to take on Luther's interpretations of scripture compared to what the Catholic church teaches.  I'm sorry, my dear, but many of the teachings of your church have in fact strayed mightily from scripture and Luther documented it to the nth degree.  So, Luther's efforts sparked what is known as "the reformation," the root word being reform.  So, there you have the two key phrases: Protest and Reform which lead us to Protestant and Reformed churches.      Sadly, I must confess to you that over time many of the Protestant churches TOO have strayed from scriptural teachings.  So, the question isn't about Catholicism versus Protestantism or the various denominations under the Catholic umbrella versus those under the Protestant umbrella, it's really about God, God's word, Jesus, etc.    There are in fact MANY protestant denominations that are called "Bible" churches and many more that are called "Reformed" churches.  The reformed churches all adhere to the stand that Luther took way back in the 1500's!  The Bible churches still have a strong commitment to sola scriptura ("by scripture alone").  I defy you as a Catholic apologist to defend ALL of your churches teachings as being rooted in scripture alone.  If you can do so then explain these two ideas straight out of the Catholic church:    1. The Bible (scripture) is clear that ALL have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (except for Jesus).  Holiness is Godliness and Godliness is aboslute purity--AKA the absence of sin.  Yet, your church calls the Pope "the HOLY father" while the Bible calls GOD the Holy Father!  Show me in scripture how the Pope can possibly be anything other than a sinner, worthy of hell, like the rest of us.  Show me in scripture how the Pope does not need to rely on the saving grace of Jesus Christ for his salvation?    2. Jesus says, "I am the truth, the life, and the way.  No one comes to the Father except by me."  Yet, Catholics pray to ... well, the list is long.  Show me in scripture where you pray to ANYONE but Jesus?    Okay ... about your "one church" question.  You're taking scripture out of context by reading it literally.  Of course there wasn't just ONE CHURCH, as in one building where everyone attended.  The Bible documents good churches and bad churches, those immersed in the Holy spirit and those seemingly existing outside it.  So, that scripture certainly makes it obvious that whether it's Catholic churches or Protestant churches or BOTH that make up the whole of God's "one church," it's going to be "one church" in spirit, uniting by Biblical teaching and God's spirit, not one physical structure.    Those Protestants who attend conservative Bible-focused churches are aghast by the liberal, revisionist teachings of some other Protestant churches.  Even though we are all under the same Protestant umbrella, we do NOT believe that we are "one church."  In fact, in many cases we would say to those Protestant churches, the Catholics have it more right than you.  Examples: Abortion and homosexuality.

After studying all the sects of religion I have concluded the main reason is: Mr & Mrs jones deciede they didn't like what pastor taught today so they go off and start another work with a slightly different twist to the same message.  Even catholics are widening their boarder some what.  they keep a tight reign on their parishners and if you disagree with a teaching they dis fellowship you before you can creat another work. No freedom.  Protestants on the other hand let you decide what you believe.  Let me share with you one church out of two that is fairly recent.  We used to have two churches - Weslyan and the Methosidst.After the big bang of Halifax, Nova Scotia ( a ship load of ammunitions and explosives not legally carrying the required flag) the two could not afford to rebuild.  they joined forces and created the United Church.  Just one example of how these things happen.  Most of the protestant churches believe the same theory about God, Jesus, etc.  they change the presentation a bit to make it more appealing to grow.  But you can see - it didn't work well.  More people today are straying away from the churches because they share your concern.  If we put God first; not the pastor, then all churches can worship with each other.  It is absurd when the United Baptist won't worship with the southern Baptist.  God help me to understand that kind of thinking because my litle pea sized brain cannot grip it.  It is the reason that although I am certified with a certain denomination I consider myself to be inter-denominational.  I can worship with them all, teach to mixed groups, learn from them all, and so on.  Jesus taught the "Church of Jesus Christ" was the one and that does not include of Latter Day Saints (Mormons)  They didn't exist until 1896 or there abouts.  Clever how they use the name Jesus started with to entice folks to their anti Christian beliefs including Polygamy etc.  My prupose was not to discredit Mormons but to verify my theory on why so many Protestant churchs when Jesus himself taught there was one that really mattered.  To follow up on that thought: Jesus also sent His disciples to rome to educate the "church of Rome" which is today the Catholic's.  If they wer so right why did Jesus send forth disciples to walk and sail all those miles to teach them the truth?  They still worship similarily to old dyas so have not improved and thus, cannot be considered Christian (follower of Christ)|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	Jesus did not found one church.

I hate how people easily believe this. The Catholic Church started hundreds of years later with the Byzantine Empire. Look it up in any history book. The real church of God has maintained itself even when the Catholic Church started gaining popularity. And you are right to say that the newer denominations came out of the Catholic Church. But the Reformation was an outcry by the true christians to fix all the contradictions and false teachings of the Catholic church. Email me if you want a list. Men like Luther read their Bibles and saw these false teachings against the Word of God. All of the protestant Churches claims are backed up by the Bible. I can't say the same about the Catholic Church.

(Edit: since I started my response, there were a couple of others that actually addressed the question).    The basic reason is differences in theology. If we were all the same church (having the same doctrine and theology) there wouldn't be any different denominations and there wouldn't be anyone claiming that their "flavor" of Christianity was the only way to God / Heaven / Christ / the "Truth."    One person said differences in interpretation and that's a large part of what lays behind the differences in theology.    As to the divisions, they were already happening in New Testament times. Paul wrote to several churches about being one faith and wrote against the divisions in the people causing so much grief in the church.    To think those divisions do not exist is blindness to the reality of life and our society.    As to any claim on having the "true church" and yes, Christ told Peter that he _would_ found his church (on what is a matter of interpretation -- some say it was Peter, others say it is Christ, and others say it is revelation), the Protestants broke away from the Church that existed down through the ages.    There are some "original" branches still existing in some parts of the world that are not tied to either catholicism (Roman and Orthodox) or Protestant movements. Groups like the JWs, Seventh-day Adventists, and Christian Scientists are basically Protestant due to the way they came into existence. Groups like the Mormons are restorationists, believing that the Gospel (church) was lost to the earth and needed to be restored. So it is either with the original church(es), including the Orthodox and Catholic, or with the restorationists (who would of necessity have to claim revelation to be valid).    It should be noted that the Catholics, Mormons, and many Protestant Churches are working toward ecumenical unity. But there are significant Protestant movements, most notably evangelical and fundamentalist, that oppose such a move toward unifying the faith. (Edit: Those that oppose the movement are the first to claim that Catholics, Mormons and others are not Christians.)
hR7OsqtRaa	In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27.

You see friend, the Holy Bible is a book on salvation from Genesis to Revelations, and because it was inspired from heaven, it has heavenly meanings. So to be able to crack these codes you must become truly born again by the water and the Spirit (John 3:3-5). In other words, by having complete faith in this gospel or the righteousness of God, you will be cleansed from all your sins, and made into Gods righteous child. And only then will you be given the keys of heaven to open things and to lock things by faith.    The message the current Christian church is sending out is a message of confusion, this is because they too have not met the righteousness of God, but think they are pure in their own eyes , but have never been cleansed from their filthiness. Hence their doctrines of repentance prayers, proving the fact that they are still sinners.

mVsWyu0yaa	Seebob:   Let me preface my response by stating that "sin" ONLY exists in the guilt-ridden minds of Christians who have supported the horrors perpetrated by the god of the Old Testament, and slavisly worhip the son of the ogre, who is posited a God of Love, but whose vengeful nature caused him to create ETERNAL punishment for the finite failings of fallible men and women.     The reason you get no concensus from Christians is that there IS none. Primarily because the majority of Bible thumpers just cannot seem to make the distinction (that the Catholic Church as already made) between homosexual orientation and same sex acts....which were committed in the BIBLE by HETEROSEXUAL men who gave over their 'NATURAL' instincts to engage in HOMOSEXUAL RAPE OF STRANGERS..thus violating the oldest Semitic Taboo in history.     For Christians to claim that the New Covenent of Jesus Christ has absolved them from the old Levitical proscriptions surrounding more than a hundred "abominations"...such as eating pork or shellfish, misusing incense, misquoting the Pentateuch, dressing in garments of mixed fibers, or even planting mixed seeds together...Yet cling to their FAVORITE abomination 'homosexuality' is not only ludicruous, but borders on bigoted and criminal insanity...since it has led to the deaths of countless gay men and women at the hands of Christain fanatics...who think it is A.O.K. to "kill a queer for Christ".

EDIT-You said:" yet they all interprete that "moral guide book" differently"      It's not just a matter of scripture, it is scientifically incompatible with our fight, as a species, for survival.  We all talk of this subject because we all know there is something NOT normal about this practice.      I asked the above question, about your sexuality because I do not understand why one would support something in which they themselves would NOT partake.  To me, that is that age old cattle/herd mentality.  Homosexuality has become a fashion statement, the IN mode of society.

I mean, there's no way to tell, objectively.  So, like every religion before you, just make it up.  How miserable do you want to make yourself for supporting gay rights?

Wanting the same rights for homosexuals is something that everyone should want, IMO.|`|4GiIXWUXaa	*thinks*  Hmmm, curious.    I do not suppose that being an advocate of human rights would qualify as "sin" but this is a touchy subject.    I have gay friends, whom i love dearly. I support their rights to be treated fairly (as human beings) and not be denied jobs (certain) or other things due to their conscious choice of sexual preference. BUT I do not support "gay marriage," and never will.   Though i love my friends, i cannot and will not every say that homosexuality is not a sin; but then again, i do not mistreat or alienate people because of their choices or because of my own personal beliefs. Most people cannot do this, hence the bickering and quarreling.    Support of "Gay Rights" has nothing to do with Coveting. Unless you are coveting their relationship and are secretly wanting to be gay, then you are not in violation of this Law. But i would think that what determines the crossing of the line into sin would be what you specifically support.   To support a person's basic rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness = not sin.  To support a person's desire (non right) to push their own agendas onto others who don't want them = sin.   To support the fair treatment of all men regardless of race, ethnicity, social class, religion or sexual preference = not sin.   To support those who stand in violent objection to a spoken and unspoken moral law in areas that crosses such a boundary = sin.    So it really depends on the situation. I support my friends insofar as their basic rights to be treated fairly as human beings. So i would support this for all men. BUT i do not support desires to marry or become a Pastor or Priest; as those are objectionable and break conscience.    In any case, you are not violating the law of coveting ... but um Me thinks you knew that already and are just trying to make a point, hey?    xoxo  ?|`|e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	No.  Coveting means "wanting."

There are several forms of "LUST"  Coveting your neighbors wife is one.  God says in His Word: "..if a man lay with a man..a woman with a woman..or a man/woman with a beast..it is an abomination to God and a stinch in God's nostrils.."  Now with that being clearly spoken how can any one deny homosexuality is sin?  The act in itself not even considering the lust aspect is an abomination.  That is serious. supporting their rights as  a citizen is one thing but you cannot justly before God uphold their sexual behavior because God said it is wrong.  Let me add in passing: some forms of "kinky sex" between married couples is also sin. God has a program for married couples and sadistical forms of sex are against God's order.  If you uphold the actions of a rapist you are an accessory to the fact. Likewise here. Absolutely no difference.  God have mercy on their souls.|`|hIaBgCrgaa	Its not really a sin as much as does not serve a function except self gratification and does not reproduce offspring. I don't think God hates gays .

Otherwise they wouldn't waste so much of their precious time thinking and talking about it. Homsexuality has been around since the beginning of time and everyone experiments with it. I think when it becomes really evil is when you have to kill to cover up your act because you are so embarrassed by it. And there are those types of people out there.

God tell us not to keep any company with such people and that includes being in support of their sinful behavior.     Is the man who lusts after a woman with his eyes any less guilty of the act of adultery in the eyes of God just because he never touched her with his hands? No.     Matthew 5:28 But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.     1 Corinthians 6:9 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,     1 Corinthians 5:11 But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.    We are to go according to the Word of God and not let our spiritual eyes get adjusted to the darkness of this sinful world.     Romans 12:2 And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.    God does not accept such behavior and says that it is punishable by death, so you are completely with God or you are with satan. No fence sitting allowed.    If you support the unrighteous, your heart is also unrighteous as well.We are not to allow ourselves to be unequally yoked with people and their sinful lifestyles if we want to remain righteous in the eyes of God.    2 Corinthians 6:14 Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?|`|93galWG1aa	Live and let live, God can judge us, I won't.|`|AA11440601	No.    All human beings deserve human rights.    Created in the image of the one God and equally endowed with rational souls, all men have the same nature and the same origin.

The Catholic Church believes there is nothing sinful about being homosexual. But all unmarried people (homosexual, bisexual, and heterosexual) are called to celibacy.    The Church specifically says that homosexuals "must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided."

They may say that they "hate the sin, but love the sinner". This is doublespeak, and effectively means hating their fellow humans.    What Leviticus 20:13 says and what Paul says in Romans 1:18-32 are immoral and barbaric by today's standards.

This is what we pray for in the Our Father Prayer,Matthew 6:10 Let your will take place on earth as it is in heaven.This is what Jesus taught us to pray for.When he died he left us an inheritence,he said "Happy are the mild-tempered for they shall inherit the earth".

Daniel 2:44 In the days of those Kings   (our day)the God of heaven will set up a Kingdom that will never be brought to ruin, it will crush and put an end to all these other Kingdoms and it itself will stand to times indefinite.Revelation 16:16    2 Peter 3:13  Isaiah 2:2-4 Isaiah 65:17-25  Isaiah 35:5-10  Revelation 21:3,4   John 5:28,29    And death will be no more,neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anyore the former things have passed away.    At that time the eyes of the blind will be opened and the ears of the deaf will be unstopped.The wolf and the lamb themselves will feed as one,and the lion will eat straw,just like the bull.  And they will have to beat their swords into  plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks, neither will they learn war anymore.    Imagine this earth transformed into a paradise,with Jesus as King.If we believe in him we know that all his ways are justice and righteous,and he would rule in accordance.    And that is why we have hope,God's word has given us this hope,and he has given us this promise and we know that his word is true.  Isaiah 40;29 He is giving to the tired one power.

Bd5My74Aaa	All elements and domains have a masculine and a feminine representation in pagan pantheons. All forces have a positive and a negative energy to them so do god forms. To the Goddess Venus (feminine love) there was Eros (masculine love). Ares (male god of war) there was Athena ( female god or war). Usually the male and females are diametrically opposed, with the primary attribute of one being a lessor attribute of the other. ( as in the case of Ares and Athena) If you wanted to generate a certain response you prayed to the god or goddess whose aspect influenced that. To take the example of Ares and Athena: Ares was the god of war and bloodshed. In other words, if you were praying for an overwhelming victory and to crush your enemy regardless of the casualties you chose the more potent war god. If you wanted to win using brains over brawn you called upon Athena.

This mistake that all Pagan religions could be so neatly lined up side by side with equivalent counterparts to each other is a misconception that is perpetuated by a lot of Neo-Pagan literature (particularly Llewellyn authors), examining history shows that this is just not the case.

When we speak of Paganism, there are so many different kinds of belief systems that came from different areas, different cultures etc.     Who is to say who is right or who is wrong? We as humans think that there can only be one answer but that in no way means that this is the Universal truth. In reality, there could be many truths, all coexisting right now, everywhere. Just because we as humans have a hard time comprehending such things, doesn't make it impossible.    I do feel that the Moon's energy is Goddess energy and that the Sun is God energy but not for the reasons as you.     What I have noticed is that dualism is everywhere on our planet. In nature, on this Earth and in the entire Universe. Even plants and flowers have male and female parts, scientifically speaking.     I don't see the Earth having to be 'just the Goddess' and the sky being 'just the God'. If you look closer, you see both in everything.    But this is my personal truth.

Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16.

Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23.

Now all they can manage is denial and circular logic.|`|GtazNrplaa	Spiritually they are only words of influence from a divine source derived from human imagination for guidance within a given society so long ago it doesn't matter in this modern world of science.    The Code of Hammurabi is just another example of those words of wisdom 5,000 years ago plus inscribed on the Stele in Sumeria giving direction of the Law and Religion epaulets.    Men like Thales and Democritus discoveries in science, geometry and navigation brought new meanings to the world some 500 BC. Democritus was well before Darwinism and theorised that the universe was made of atoms moving in a vacuum where the heaviest made solid the earth and the lighter ones became the air which we breath. Democritus also theorised that monkeys were related to humans.    Nothing like a bit of history thrown in to confuse the issue but it is fun fun and more fun.|`|JTD3M8Ziaa	Ha...that's impossible because the bible god is pure undiluted evil.|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully. - Richard Dawkins    A God who kept tinkering with the universe was absurd; a God who interfered with human freedom and creativity was tyrant. If God is seen as a self in a world of his own, an ego that relates to a thought, a cause separate from its effect. he becomes a being, not Being itself. An omnipotent, allknowing tyrant is not so different from earthly dictators who make everything and everybody mere cogs in the machine which they controlled. An atheism that rejects such a God is amply justified. - Karen Armstrong    Whats God? Well, you know, when you want something really bad and you close your eyes and you wish for it? Gods the guy that ignores you. - Steve Buscemi|`|R5MXZ9FFaa	Start with these shining examples of god's "love":      Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces, even the dung of your solemn feasts; and one shall take you away with it.  (Malachi 2:3)    Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. (Numbers 31:17)    Thus saith the LORD of hosts ... Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ***.  (1 Samuel 15:2-3)    Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.  (Psalms 137:9)    And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat. (Leviticus 26:29)     And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters. (Deuteronomy 28:53)    Yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of their womb.  (Hosea 9:16)    Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up.  (Hosea 13:16)    Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be spoiled, and their wives ravished. (Isaiah 13:16)|`|xfYUxKmvaa	You misunderstand. God offers eternal life.    The Bible shows what is wrong with men and why we need Jesus.|`|AA11002471	God's name means "I become what I must become".  This means if he must appear  "cruel" as you put it, he will do so.  That does not mean he is cruel.  However, he will become what it takes.  The 1500 years during which the Israelites were his people, eye for an eye was the rule of the day.  That wasn't God's idea, but he did say, "O.K. Israelites. you want to proceed on that basis .....let's live like that. Strict, harsh justice."  It was clearly demonstrated that this was not the way to go.  God accomplished his purpose.  He became what he had to become.|`|AQ74jcKEaa	Very simple. No one ever died for you so you may live eternity with Him. God did, by sending His only begotten Son Jesus to die in your place.|`|3b6e1dec9119c4f762d2c636b495d3feaa	i love you. Jesus lives inside of me.    edit: glo wings!  i promise, i answered this question before i read yours.    loving hearts think alike...|`|JLNoIXkuaa	Our Lord is kind and loving just like we humans can be kind and loving. We are made in our Lord's image and that means He is like us, or should I say we are like Him.     We humans can be very loving; our Lord can also be loving. We can get angry and wish we could send people to hell; our Lord can also get angry and (in His case) He can send people to hell.    There is a difference between human anger and our Lord's anger, though. When we humans get angry, nothing happens (we have no power). When our Lord gets angry, all kinds of bad things can happen because He is God. If our Lord pronounces judgment on someone when He's angry, that judgment has to come to pass now because His words are so powerful.    Good thing our Lord is slow to get angry; unlike we humans.    To Him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be praise and honor and glory for ever and ever. Jesus Christ is Lord.|`|Lzv3Rfgsaa	I am an atheist ( I know that your question was addressed to Christians) and I have often wondered how people can worship such a bloodthirsty God. I would say that Christians would probably justify Gods' actions with quotes such as "God is a righteous judge who always condemns the wicked." There definitely seems to be a distinct change in the actions of the Old and New testament God, with one often using violence with alarming frequency and the other teaching compassion, love and telling his followers to "love they neighbour."|`|CKieDvu1aa	I am a strong mormon (which is a form of christanity) and I believe that god has put us on the earth as a test.I believe that he has let us suffer because he when we get through tough times it makes us better as people.Have you ever heard that song by Christina Aguilera called fighter?It says like..   Cause if it wasn't for all that   you tried to do  I wouldn't know   just how capable  I am to pull through    so I wanna say thank you    CHORUS:  Cause it makes me that much stronger  Makes me work a little bit harder  It makes me that much wiser    I hope this helps you to understand that I believe that god does what he does because he knows that we can get through it.|`|8Efiet86aa	I would have to say that although there are things in the bible to make God look unkind and makes you wonder. the many times that things were done in the bible to show his anger, was after he showed people his love and kindness, his ability to always provide for those that love him. He showed the people of those times many many miracles. and they still doubted him, they still turned away and turned to statues built by man to rescue them.   he also gave his son as a scarifies for US, we who sin against him daily. so that we can have  the kind of relationship with him that we were meant to have. would you scarifies someone you love for those that do not know you and in many cases don't want to know you?|`|62izvCxXaa	First, God is only "mean" if you start by thinking people are any good.  The Bible tells us that God made everything- therefore we are all his "property".  We have no right telling someone else what they must do with their stuff.      Second, The Bible, aka God's word, tells us that we are all evil from birth because of Adam's sin in the Garden of Eden.  And the punishment for this is death.  God is the embodiment of life.  Our punishment is separation from Him- ergo death.  God is KIND because He chooses to postpone that just punishment.    Third, God is kind because he IS JUST.  He judges evil.  How terrible would it be if a murder went to court and the judge decided to say, "Ahh, I don't think I'll punish you... so go on your way."  That would be terrible!  That would not be kind and loving to those effected by the murder.  God is Kind and Loving because He is Just.    Fourth, there was no way that we could avoid death and eternal separation from God... and yet he made a way for our redemption.  It's like going to court and not being able to pay your fine... and here God steps in and pays it for you so you don't have to go to jail.      Those are some reasons why God is Kind and Loving and Just.

Or you could ask her if she thinks she's doing Jesus proud by being so gleeful at the thought of one of his children suffering for eternity.|`|wnkoTEqVaa	Do the Atheist thing and ignore her.

Maybe, pat her on the head.|`|iYEWbE23aa	Laugh back.|`|DQZK3eKfaa	Don't do anything. Be the bigger person. You believe in what you believe in. I don't think you'll burn in hell. That was mean for her to say.|`|9Q6CkSMzaa	Ignore her. What the hell (no pun intended) is it her business? Your beliefs are your beliefs.     If you REALLY want to do something, you could tell her that you'll laugh at her when you see her rotting in the ground just like everyone else (if that's what you believe of course, being an Atheist).|`|AA10556726	Ignore her.  She obviously does not understand her own religion, nor does she realize that according to her religion she's likely to be with you... if hell existed.|`|1cGlucXyaa	Knowing someone is going to go to hell is not a funny matter. She was just being rude. This is why Jesus told us to preach the gospel. And Paul tells us that if anyone is in a sin, then we should help them with compassion.|`|DZ5jSsMvaa	Well, if there is a hell. she would be there right next to you.  (although you might be the one in heaven. But she will be in hell with that attitude)    But then there is no evidence for heaven, hell or life after death.

l9RDuthbaa	It's one of my favorite songs. I'll probably ruin it trying to translate it, but here goes -     Adorned is your forehead with black gold  (I can't remember if it was written in a song)  Your forehead rhymes with eyes and light  (I can't remember if it was rhymed in a song)  But for whoever you'll be  His life is filled with song    Your pink robe is fluffy and soft  You always wrap yourself in it before night  I wouldn't want to be your brother  Not a monk praying to the image of an angel  And see grim dreams of sanctity  And in front of him - you, a woman...    You like to be  Sad and silent  To listen to a story about a something close, something far,  And I, that not once I'll be watching you silently,  no sound or words  Forgetting everything about other people.  My soul resides within the walls of your home  Captive between your walls, set apart from me,  As I in my body apart from you.    Stretched out is my dream as a rug to your feet,  Pace, beloved on its flowers of your paces  Wear your pink robe before night,  In a short while I will come to you.    And your black gold adorned forehead  will come close to my lips like a rhyme to a song,  when I whisper to your ear till the morning, till dawn  like a drunk man...  Adorned is your forehead with black gold

TLLklriUaa	For the same reason that people who believed that blacks were equal to whites felt the need to prove it during the civil rights movement.

We have believed many things that we have later found out to be false.|`|0xiHNsmVaa	They don't have any thing better to do. It bothers them that so many people believe in God or a god. In fact 90 percent of the word belongs to a faith. So they are alone, with their science living for no purpose.|`|czf6uhIraa	So that I can be absolutely positive that it's totally natural.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	You wouldn't... unless you had millions of people insisting it wasn't natural. Then you might want the studies to prove them wrong.|`|AA10969632	If I had a need to prove something then I obviously had someone who didn't believe me...hence the need to prove it.|`|oFSWpOjCaa	I would feel the need to prove it if someone was attempting to tell me that it was unnatural, and belittling or persecuting my lifestyle because of that opinion.|`|6737bc1385aaa269c889b6f7c3e1c1e7aa	A) Because so many people try to disprove it or disown it, thus making themselves the first to strike.    B) Because it's better to find out and be wrong rather than to just be blind and make more mistakes for lack of knowledge.
XN0cYCATaa	No, A variation on the theme of evolution is theistic evolution. It states that God initiated life on earth and allowed evolutionary principles to bring man to where he is--maybe with a little help from God here and there. At least this theory includes God. But this theory was developed in part by Bible believing people who thought that evolution had some merit. In addition, it is an attempt to answer the many problems existing not only in the fossil record but also with how life could somehow randomly form out of nothing. Because of problems like this, some believe they can be explained by simply adding God to the picture: God directed evolution.         For those who hold to the Bible as the word of God, theistic evolution should not be a viable option. The Bible says, "Know that the LORD is God. It is he who made us..." (Psalm 100:3). The Scriptures state that God created. God said, "Let there be..." and there was. The Scriptures speak of the creative word of God. When God speaks; it occurs. He said "Let there be" and it was so. It does not say, "Let there be a slow development through an evolutionary process."         God said in Genesis 1:26, "Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground." The Hebrew word for "make" in this verse and in verse 25 where God makes the beasts, is "asah." It means to do, work, make, produce. This is not simply the limited Hebrew understanding of evolutionary principles.         The land animals were made differently than man. The animals were made from the ground but man was made directly by God: "the LORD God formed the man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being" (Gen. 2:7). Evolution states that man evolved from life forms that developed in the ocean. Here, God made man from the dust of the ground--not the water of the ocean.         If evolution is true and the Bible is true then how is the formation of Eve explained? She was created out of one of Adam's ribs (Gen. 2:22). There is no way to explain this if theistic evolution is true; that is, unless you want to say that Eve wasn't made from Adam's side. Then, if you do that, you are doubting the very word of God.         Also, Jesus said in Mark 10:6 "But at the beginning of creation God made them male and female.'" The beginning was not evolutionary slime; in the beginning of creation there was Adam and Eve.         Though this information is brief and far from complete, it should be obvious that theistic evolution and the Scriptures cannot be harmonized.

Many of the people in Y!A believe in a much smaller god, who can only manage a creation suitable for a goat-herder's campfire story.    The more you treat Genesis as a scientific fact, the smaller God gets, and the more you have to deny truly divine things like DNA and Hubble Telescope pictures.|`|KrdOKdJcaa	Sure, why not.|`|1Te4sfqIaa	No it isn't.  My understanding is that Theistic Evolution is an attempt to reconcile faith with the overwhelming scientific evidence for evolution.  I.e. "Evolution is correct and it functions as it does because God determined that it should."      This is actually a fair method of allowing people to trust in science and in their faith.  And this is as it should be.      Religion deals with the spiritual while science has developed and tested and perfected its methods of observing and explaining the natural world through the scientific method.  The fact that the human race has advanced so quickly since we began using the scientific method is evidence of its validity.  So where religion and science have a conflict about the natural world, it should be religion that defers to the science and adapts its beliefs accordingly.

ToztjpAsaa	Yes, of course we have free will, but within a set of cultural rules which we learn as children (or should do).  Without those constraints we would have anarchy.    There is a school of thought which suggests that our concepts of morality are, to some extent, hard-wired into our brains as part of a primitive survival strategy to allow us to live in extended social groups.    When free will is allowed free rein, that's when we have crime.  And the prisons are full to bursting point.|`|Z4QbQt3Xaa	I think you misunderstand the term 'free-will' & GOD.  Animals do not have free-will, they just respond to their instincts.  Which is what you are describing for most trivial decisions you make.  The consequences of those decisions are largely immaterial.  You are correct in your assumption that free-will is tied to GOD.  When we have to make an important decision, we do have a choice.  We can do the selfish thing, or we can consider other people instead.  We know the difference between a good choice & an evil choice.  Yes, GOD may know the outcome, but we make the choice.  Where we are deprived of the freedom to choose, that is not a sin.  But GOD knew that we would make mistakes, or bad choices.  So He came among us as a man, Jesus, to show us the way.  Being both human & divine, Jesus did not sin, but saved us.|`|GeoiGjbCaa	Free will can only exist without an omniscient god.    http://ph.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...    Shakim seems to think ?"free will" is simply what it means. Did you chose to type up this question or did somebody make you?God could of made us "robots" in the sense that we were completely controlled & had no decisions to make on our own"    The problem is that shakim doesn't understand the question.    If god knows the outcome of all future events, then he knew you would choose to make this post.  In your own eyes, you may have suffered terribly for days deciding whether or not to post, but god would have known you'd do that, too. Whether you pored over the decision or not is irrelevant. God saw it all and knew you would post.     THEREFORE "FREE WILL" IS AN ILLUSION IF GOD KNOWS ALL PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE.    This isn't a complicated mind trick. There's nothing up my sleeves. It's simply an indisputable fact.|`|ni6SCUm9aa	Think of your brain as a large pool table. All the pool balls are moving around, hitting each other, all by the laws of causality. The pool balls are the individual particles (atoms, in this case, or maybe subatomic particles if you wanted to be precise) that make up your brain.    Now, anyone who plays pool can tell you that there is only ONE way in which those pool balls can move - if you know the position and velocity of each ball, you will know where they all are the next moment. There is only one way in which they can bounce off each other, and move in another direction.    Since there is only ONE way in which those pool balls can hit each other, bounce off, and go in another direction, your brain can only make ONE decision, ONE thought, after each consecutive moment, and what each thought is cannot be avoided (do those individual pol balls have free will? Of course not, and neither does your brain as a whole). All actions cannot be avoided, are all caused, and as such we cannot be held responsible for them.    There is only one possible outcome for each choice you are presented, and, as such, you do not have free will (which necessitates two possible outcomes).|`|l4lGSSG0aa	free will means to make your own decisons.  Do you make your own decisions?  Everyone has the capability to make their own decisons.  The reason why the Lord gave us free will is because He did not want a whole bunch of robots running around.  He wants us to CHOOSE Him not be forced to love Him.  Those of us who chose Him has the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit is what guides us to make the right choices but even then ultimately we make the final choice.  God just gives us a nudge.  I love it when I feel convicted because I hate that feeling so when I feel convicted I know that I did something wrong.|`|GWB1R0jQaa	Part of what you say is true. We have limits. No matter how much I want to jump off the ground and fly, it won't happen. This is because of physical laws.    However - you did CHOOSE to pick the romantic song, instead of the rock song. You choose it, based on past experiences. It was a choice. You had the choice to listen to the rock one too, you just CHOOSE not to.  God does exist, and I'm sorry for the turmoil you're going through. I hope I helped you understand.    If you're looking for a meaning in life - listen to Toby Mac's song "Made to Love".|`|afripzVJaa	Free will is not illusionary at all.  "free will" is simply what it means. Did you chose to type up this question or did somebody make you?    We all have to admit there are some things in life we can't control... such as our looks, our voice, and bodies.   But "free-will" is not saying that. Free will is simply meaning your ability to have a conscience, and whether or not using it when making decisions.  God could of made us "robots" in the sense that we were completely controlled & had no decisions to make on our own.|`|NSSkC052aa	I think you should see the differences between humans and other creatures (or animals) to know what does free-will means.    Edited:-  Terry W, you forget this one:  If God exist and know every choice that each person has, but the God wills to not know whats each person will choose. To be fair on judgment.|`|xfYUxKmvaa	There is no free will. The bible says the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life.    From the moment we are born we are going to die. That is not the will of anyone for anyone at anytime.  God offers eternal life. Jesus paid the wages.|`|si3eq11haa	in the bible, there is a verse that God gives to you...  "Be still..........................and know that I AM .... God"    i think you need to be still.     all this rushing about is really getting to you.    just stop. .... now..... rest a while......    the bible says that all those who accept Jesus into their lives are free indeed.    freewill is a gift from God. you are free to make a choice to accept that God is Who He says He is,   or you can make a choice to disbelieve it.     if you decide to take God at His word and choose to ask Jesus into your life, then with that, comes freedom. freedom from a certain eternity in hell, freedom from being enslaved to sin/wrongdoing, freedom from so many debilitating things.    but you wont have that freedom, until you choose ( freely ) to accept Jesus into your life.    make a decision to entrust your life to Jesus.     that's where faith comes in.    God wont let you down, but you have to choose to trust that He wont.   are you ready to trust Him?|`|d265DZbHaa	If god exists then free will is an illusion    If god does not exist then there is free will.    This is because free will is the knowledge of how to over ride the determining and limiting aspects of nature. If there is a god and he knows everything about past, present and future then there is no override. However because there is no god or other supernatural force then we can learn to change our futures.
e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	You could use one of the frozen text standards, like the "Our Father."  Or you could just tell God how you're feeling about something.  But you don't have to say anything.    Some prayers can be asking for stuff, or telling God stuff.  But the best prayers I have are when I can quiet my mind and focus on just being there in God's presence.    It's like when you love somebody so much that you don't have to speak.    Get to a quiet place.  Put yourself into God's presence and either speak to Him with your thoughts or just sit quietly.|`|TinNG7k7aa	You do it by not drawing attention to yourself. Just meditate and talk in your heart to the higher standard, the Creator.    No ritual. No special needs. No whining or culture. It's private and personal.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	Matt ^6:9 and pour out your heart in Jesus' name..|`|V0oc22ryaa	Whisper this prayer to God so that only you can hear yourself and say:    Lord Jesus I ask you to forgive me now of all my sins and come into my heart as I now repent of all my sins and be my own personal Lord and savior and save me now from all sin and hell, write my name in the lambs book of life so that on judgment day I will be allowed to enter heaven for accepting Jesus Christs sacrifice of dying on the cross for me and I will not be cast into hell which  was not prepared for me but was prepared for the devil and his angels, I thank you now Lord Jesus that I am now saved and on my way to heaven because you are now in my heart as you have promised if I ask you to come in as you are not liar but are a God of your word,  now teach me all your correct ways and truths in which you would have me walk and make all my ways well pleasing in Your sight even as a sweet fragrance to thy nostrils and a sweet sound to thine ears In Jesus Holy Name, Amen. http://www.cptryon.org/prayer/  http://www.biblestudygames.com/biblestud...|`|9mLjDa5kaa	Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|GWB1R0jQaa	Okay;     1. Don't think of it as praying. Rename it "talking to God".    2. Tell him about your day. Tell him how you feel about everything. You'd be surprised how many conversations with him start off with "... um, hi? I don't do this very often, but..."     Just talk to him like you'd talk to someone else, except you don't have to be strong or tough or fake for him. He won't laugh at you.     Another good thing is if there's something you can't put a word on, you don't have to phrase it, because he knows what you mean.|`|1oYjjp0Daa	Step 1.:  suspend all rational thought    Step 2.:  talk to yourself making any wish you like    Step 3.:  recognise that if any wish comes true it's purely coincidence. But you'll find if you want something to happen just kneeling down and talking to an imaginary friend has a very low success rate - even religionists will recognise the phrase "god helps those who help themselves"|`|oFSWpOjCaa	real easy....talk to yourself. whatever it is you feel the need to pray about, just talk through it with yourself until you work it out. I may not believe in god, but I do believe that prayer/meditation/self reflection are beneficial.|`|USKa5FR7aa	you can read a book you can get it up on you computer xx|`|si3eq11haa	hiya John, i assume you want to pray to God? praying is another word for talking , listening and singing to God.  it is relationship with Jesus.   it is chatting,  and waiting and listening to see what He wants to say to you.   when God talks to you, it will often be in a very quiet voice in your very being.  have you invited Jesus to come and live in your heart? if not, that is a very good place to start praying about. when you ask Him, He will come and be with you forever, and His Holy Spirit will show you how to pray in a very special way.   when you pray/talk to God, just talk to Him about how you feel, what is on your mind, and yes, you may feel awkward at first, how often do we feel awkward when we first meet someone and start a friendship or a conversation? but it will get easier as you get to know Him.   go on, just chat to Him, He loves you just as you are, feeling awkward or not, and He knows whats on your mind and in your heart. ask Him to help you pray.   go on, its lovely to talk to God. x|`|aRkYiXtGaa	just imagine you have an imaginary friend and start talking to him or her, it wont make any difference, only you can make things happen|`|0l98mcf3aa	You don't identify the religion involved here. I assume this would be Christianity, but I could be wrong.  If it is, then the previous answers seem okay.  If it's Islam or any other religion, then there may be ritualistic circumstances that need to be fulfilled before prayer, such as taking your shoes off and facing in the right direction. I'm not of the Islamic faith, so if I've got this wrong, I'm sorry.  So, if you want to pray in a Christian way, to God or to Jesus, the previous answers will guide you.|`|qEIURrnJaa	Pray standered text prayers eg our father, hail mary etc or pray from your heart.|`|AA11225089	Praying is just talking to God, like you would to anyone. Jesus gave us the Lord's prayer as a guide, so we know how to give praise to God, and lift up his name, to acknowledge that he is above us in all things, to ask for his will to be worked out in our lives, and to ask for help for ourselves and for others. I often just tell God about what is happening, he is interested in the small things as well as the big things.|`|Ium0qE5paa	http://www.islamway.com/english/images/p...
AA11640108	"It just doesn't make any sense why some people would say there is no God with out proof."  One cannot prove something does NOT exist logically.  The burden is on the theist to provide objective proof of existence in order for the theist to convince the non-theist.    Fortunately for the theist, belief in God does not require proof, it is called Faith.  Just leave the non-theists be.|`|cNniG2L0aa	"Evolution is a theory, not a law"  Actually, it's a fact - you just haven't caught on yet.    "And what about the gap between the fossil record and present life on Earth?"  There are so many transitional fossils they can't classify them all.  You really need to catch up to modern science.  You're just vomiting stuff which was defeated 50 years ago.    "there is no God with out proof"  I love how you people aren't able to stay on the path of logic.  What has evolution got to do with your invisible sky critter?    OH, and no one can 'prove' there's no 'god' like no one can prove there's no Thor, Allah, Goblins, Faeries, Unicorns, etc.    (Samuel Johnson) 'Tis better to remain silent and be thought a fool, than open one's mouth and remove all doubt.   ~|`|ni6SCUm9aa	LOL.    "Just a theory..."    My favorite straw man.|`|feBJEgcgaa	Does it matter?    Does it make sense to claim there is God without proof?|`|HOYIAMi2aa	Before you go claiming evolution is bogus, do some research on it from unbiased websites.  Perhaps pick up a basic biology textbook.|`|8ibIQu2eaa	"And what about the gap between the fossil record and present life on Earth?"    Uhhh..(sigh) Pick up a book please! There have been 2 million identified species on Earth. Do you really think we can find every one of their common ancestors when fossilization rarely occurs and also that we would have to find a billion year history of fossils?|`|AA11202852	Look up the definition of scientific theory. It is not guesswork, as most people seem to think.    And not knowing the cause of something does not prove the existence of god.|`|AA10556726	Just because you do not understand what a theory is, does not mean that you have a clue about what you are asserting.    How can you say that Zeus is not real without proof?  Can you show proof that Santa doesn't exist?    Nice try, but sorry.|`|AA10969632	Sometimes the most intelligent answer is to acknowledge that humanity is simply ignorant of the origins of the universe.  There is no reason to assume a god.    Evolution doesn't deal with origins or the universe; it is related to what life did after it started and how it came to be what it is today.      Anyone who thinks random gaps in the fossil record disproves evolution doesn't know anything about the theory.  For your own sake, do some more research so you won't be ignorant.|`|AA11711450	It makes as much sense as people saying there is a god without proof. Maybe more because although evolution is a theory, theories are supported by facts and evidence. Hypothesis such as creationism are supported by nothing more than faith and words written by people who believed the Earth was flat.|`|R8oS6LB3aa	You don't even understand the meaning of the word "theory" as it used in science, or you'd know that evolution is both fact AND theory. Besides, there is FAR more evidence for evolution than there is for silly theistic beliefs.|`|aN7lmNmoaa	1) God is just a theory as well. The theory of evolution makes more sense and has more proof than the theory of god.    2) Why even ask the question if your mind is made up?    3) There is no proof that there IS a god either|`|qGgSqvMpaa	After 'say evolution--it's totally bogus' I stopped reading cuz I was laughing too much. =)    Oh dear, another EPIC FAIL.

Who created Humans.? People may say The Big Bang. Then Who Created the Big Bang.? Particles ? Who created the particles ? I can keep going on and on.  Answer : Humans are not real since there is no evidence of their evolution.  Would you accept the above argument. ?  If I tell you Who Created God, then you would say Who created the one who created God and it would go on and on.  We know God is real, since we are real. If you deny God, then you have to deny your own existence, which is impossible. No matter how knowledgable or intelligent you are, you cannot deny that there has to be a supernatural force that has created our planet and our body and, that creator is God.    In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16.

Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23.

And as for "gaps between steps," there is no way that every single part can be filled, same with any scientific theory.     As for proof of God, the burden of proof is on you. Do you have any?
KFtxaISsaa	Its not only two characteristics the ones that matter. One can be liked by others for having a  good figure, a cool style of clothing, smartness, grace, skills, way of thinking, ability to express themselves physically and so on     Besides, and considering the superficiality that the system creates, I suppose very beautiful people are considered frivolous and with a lack of intelligence, so they also have to demonstrate (and make an effort for it) they are not.    What do you think?|`|QsQj8jO7aa	Wow, you must be really really beautiful.|`|8CyT8tJWaa	Yes, because it's more than just looks, unlike what most people think nowadays.|`|Vfa2zae0aa	not every thing is about looks  some of the best people are not the greatest looking  and if you judge by looks you wont find true love

e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	It tastes kinda like a cracker.    We take it because we believe Jesus was being literal when He said "Take and eat, for this is my body which is given up for you."  John 6:54   It's not a symbol or a representation.    We believe it is not a symbol, but Jesus's real body under the form of bread (flour and water).  When we take communion all together, God grace in us grows stronger.|`|Z4QbQt3Xaa	We believe it's truly the Body of Christ!

The host is transfored during the liturgy of the eucharist part of the mass.  This is the celebration of the last supper where Jesus gave his disciples the bread and wine and proclaimed that, "This is my body and this is my blood."   Firm believers in their faith believe that the host IS the body of Christ.      Now, it is taught that one does not chew or eat the host, but let it dissolve on the tougue since it is the body of Christ.  However, some do chew and eat the host.   Why?  You would have to ask them, but if it is the true body of Christ, why would someone chew it like a piece of burger?  I have no idea.  I notice this at mass every time I go...I just ignore it and hopefully God will too.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	I have been a Catholic for a long time but don't know the term.|`|AA11640108	It is not yummy.

AA10901855	I grew up in a house where my parents spanked us.    I personally don't think that spanking solves anything if the child is not a baby. The pain from spanking wears off and what then...I think other forms of punishment would be best.    Like one time...my dad spanked me for something and I told him fine..I'm only doing it on the outside just to please you and because I didn't want anymore licks but know that on the inside I'm rebelling...he didn't spank me again after that.|`|xsZfN0JHaa	Spanking is discipline if handle properly. It's when anger is used that it becomes abusive.|`|k7FD3rt5aa	In my opinion, a spanking is not abuse. It shouldn't leave bruises or draw blood.    I think parents should give them in private.|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	Should I go punch someone who does something I don't like? I don't see the difference with spanking.|`|6Whz1p5Eaa	I don't think parents should EVER spank in public, but I don't think there is anything necessarily wrong with spanking as long as it's in the child's best interest.    My reasoning: Parents have spanked their children for literally thousands of years. Then, suddenly in the last two generations society decided it wasn't okay. And I used to work in a day care, let me tell you there are a LOT of spoiled kids out there. If you look at the statistics, American kids aren't doing too well. I say go with the wisdom of the ages.    My parents never spanked me a lot, but having the fear of getting spanked in the back of my mind kept me from misbehaving many times.|`|TinNG7k7aa	No.    Beating a child is stupid and useless and I'd kick anyone's *** for doing that.    But a spanking is not abuse and is not a beating.    The difference is that abuse is based in bitterness and hate. A spanking come from trying to teach a child what something dangerous or harmful is and giving the lesson an emotional impact.|`|a8e2130188e45facab4c16a4a764104caa	Spanking a child or teen is unpleasant to the child/teen ... but it is a form of punishment and when punishment is warranted, then a few licks of the belt on the teen butt won't harm him as long as he knows his parents' love and affection 24/7/365.    So, I do believe that spanking a child 'exclamation mark' is NOT necessarily abuse and if you do something wrong in public then a spanking in public can be understandable. Though in this day and age the parent might get arrested.  Better that dad takes us aside, to the bedroom or den, especially if it is going to be one of the rare bare beltings.    As long as the parent isn't doing it "behind closed doors" because it is going to be abusive or excessive.  .|`|mPTBU0QDaa	I think the purpose of spanking is to help the child not do the behavior in the future. I don't think the purpose is to humiliate the child. So, for that reason, if at all possible, I think it's best to spank a child in private, wait til you get to the car, etc. However, sometimes it needs to be done right away! In those cases, I prefer a more subtle "spank", such as a pinch or something.|`|1WisnX8naa	No, spanking is not abuse...    Beating is abuse...    Sometimes a child just needs a short attention getter to keep them focused...  a quick short shot to the shorts usually does it. I've seen too many people trying to 'discuss' things in public with a screaming child. It doesn't work...|`|bK5MJCxhaa	I think there are better ways of educating children in proper behavior.  I think spanking is the first resort of people who don't know how to do anything else.|`|UWzAiu8Iaa	I believe in spankings but not beatings. I think it should be done with a hand & not an object such as a belt. I spank my younger children when they do something bad right then even in public b/c if you wait & swat them for it later they don't know why you are even doing it.|`|czf6uhIraa	It is wrong.  It teaches the child that violence and pain is an appropriate answer.|`|3GAiVmEAaa	I would not go as far to call it child abuse, but I think it unnecessary.    I think most people do it for revenge and not in an attempt to help the kid, that is my main issue with it. They won't beat their kids, but it feels better to spank than contain yourself and give a time out. There are other ways to punish, but it requires more self control and you don't get the immediate satisfaction.|`|AA10969632	Spanking teaches children that it is okay to solve your  problems with violence.      Children who are raised to listen to reason do not need to be spanked.  My sister and I were only (very lightly) spanked maybe once or twice when we were younger and it was because our dad got mad, not because it helped to correct our behavior.    A parent could just as easily verbally reprimand their child in public rather than use spanking.  Of course, words can be abusive if chosen for anger rather than constructive reasons.|`|9Q6CkSMzaa	No, I don't think it's wrong. Excessively, yes, but sometimes it's needed.    I, personally, would say that it should be done behind closed doors. Other measures can be taken while in public. It really should be done behind closed doors, because you could be offending other people, who perhaps don't believe in spanking, if you do it in public.|`|3306acbb7100c0f39897a04c473a7708aa	Yes.  that is wrong.  It's not teaching the kid anything.. it's humiliating them in public.|`|szXPvEt8aa	its to late after their in prison|`|KrdOKdJcaa	I think it has been proven many times over that punishment is not the most effective way to raise a child, and physical abuse of any kind is just the worst type of punishment.     In public, it is never ok. While I can't dictate to someone what they do in the privacy of their own home, I would strongly recommend not spanking.    I never once got spanked, and yet I respect my parents fiercely. Always have, always will.

The main reason though is what passes for the religion of the Bible has nothing to do with what the Bible actually teaches.  So even though one is sincere in wanting to serve God and be close to Him, they have gone to the wrong address.  God is not there.    The majority of the population of the world does not want to serve God.  They rather want their own pleasures in this corrupt system now.  That is why Jesus referred to the "road leading to destruction as wide and spacious".  While the "path leading to life" is narrow and cramped.  (Matt. 7:13-14)  This would include those so-called Christians who do not want to be bothered with God other than sometimes showing up at some location occasionally.  Normally only because business or social interests push this behavior.    With no real truth there in these churches, why should anyone attend?  They are not taught anything but watered down basics of the Bible.  People could do just as well reading the Bible on their own.  Such a "hit or miss" approach would be as effective as attending any of those so-called Christian churches.    Really what is needed is to find the one religion God does approve.  Jesus told us it exists.  Only through proper worship will God both bless and give life to those properly serving Him.  The one that does follow the Bible most closely is also the one that is growing most today.  It does have not only the "milk" of truth, but the "meatier" deeper parts of God's truth as well.  That one has those who actually live their lives by Bible principles.  It is each ones responsibility to find that one for themselves.    That application of Bible principles in daily life helps us to forgive all sorts of people.  This is based on principled love as part of the "fruitages of the spirit" we are to cultivate.  (Gal. 5:22-23)|`|AA11476749	Because of disobedience.      If we wanted what Jesus wanted, we would both attend church and forgive those who have offended us.    Jesus said that if we forgive others, we will be forgiven.  If we don't, we won't.    Jesus established His church as the vehicle to learn of Him and to promote the Gospel.  Lone Ranger Christians either don't understand this, or choose to disobey.  The word "church" is taken from the Greek word "ekklesia," which means a "called out assembly."  When you don't attend the assembly, you disobey.|`|fb20242b0c0635b69a6d2c2fceab8b4eaa	There are many reasons, but perhaps I can give you some insight. I think one of the problems of the modern Church is that of relevance. Churches today are trying to become entertainment centers to draw in more people. That's fine, but the problem with that is the Church loses it's relevance in society. The Church should be a place to escape the world, not partake in it further. Perhaps if more Churches were to emphasize the appeal of holy living, and the Gospel, people would see it's relevance in society. In other words the emphasis in many churches today seems to be family values, and appealing to the masses to draw people into the Church where they get the Gospel message. But this may be leaving those that are seeking what is missing from the world behind. Many Churches are also pre-occupied with building projects and are constantly asking for money which causes people to wonder what the motives are.|`|AA10292210	The reason they have stopped attending Church according to Scripture is one;It is fulfilling the great falling away 2 Thessalonians 2:3,and second because Jesus said that in the end time "because iniquity shall abound,the love of many shall wax cold" Matthew 24.These are being fulfilled.It`s coming down to the bases of those who are true followers of Jesus and those who are not.And,even all those that attend Church are not following the Lord appropriately.|`|GWQNRdgYaa	Because its boring and a waste of 1 to 2 hours.|`|8tdlP1rOaa	b/c ppl at church can be so judging, making ppl not welcome anymore, such as having a daughter or son who is gay.   or possibly a divorce.   or maybe their church has become all about the money.   or maybe they just like sleeping in  or maybe they found a different religion to go by.   everyones sins should be forgiven.   it shouldnt be that hard.   it just, ppl can be so judging at times.   and they can be hateful.

These perishable bodies of ours are not able to live forever.         1Cr 15:51 But let me tell you a wonderful secret God has revealed to us. Not all of us will die, but we will all be transformed.         1Cr 15:52 It will happen in a moment, in the blinking of an eye, when the last trumpet is blown. For when the trumpet sounds, the Christians who have died [fn] will be raised with transformed bodies. And then we who are living will be transformed so that we will never die.         1Cr 15:53 For our perishable earthly bodies must be transformed into heavenly bodies that will never die.         1Cr 15:54 When this happens--when our perishable earthly bodies have been transformed into heavenly bodies that will never die--then at last the Scriptures will come true: "Death is swallowed up in victory.

Job 9:24 (NIV) When a land falls into the hands of the wicked* (*like the USA falling into the hands of Obama?), he* (*God) blindfolds its judges. If it is not he, then who is it*?

OUT OF THE MOUTH OF THE MOST HIGH PROCEEDETH NOT EVIL AND GOOD*? (*Preachers lie, they say that God is GOOD, but not firstly EVIL read it again FIRST EVIL and then good as a teaser!)      Exodus 4:11 (NIV) The Lord said to him, Who gave man his mouth? Who makes him deaf or mute? Who gives him sight or makes him blind? Is it not I, the Lord? (Isnt the Bible God so nice to brag about it so we dont have to blame the Devil for handicapping people all the time?)    Amos 3:6 (infallible King James Version) Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? shall there be EVIL in a city, and the lord hath not done it?* (*ALL THE EVIL IN THE WORLD COMES FROM GOD NOT FROM SATAN!!!)    Proverbs 16:4 (NIV)  The LORD hath made all things for himself: yea, EVEN THE WICKED FOR THE DAY OF EVIL.    DONT BLAME THE DEVIL, PLEASE!!! No primitive religion in the world is as wicked as the Bible God religion and I dont even want to talk about Islam! Christians made up in their mind about what Christianity ought to be all about in spite of the overwhelming primitive savagery describing the Bible God! How masochistically oriented you must be to become a Christian?    Ruth 1:20-21 (NIV) Don't call me Naomi, she told them. Call me Mara, because the Almighty has made my life very bitter. I went away full, but the Lord has brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi? The Lord has afflicted me; the Almighty* (*NOT SATAN, but God Almighty! PRAISE THE LORD! Sweet Jesus! Amen?) has brought misfortune upon me.    Proverbs 1:26-28 (NIV) I* (*God NOT SATAN, but God!)  in turn will laugh at your disaster; I WILL MOCK WHEN CALAMITY OVERTAKES YOU* (*Christians are taking advantage of any calamity like a forthcoming California Earthquake to convey a message from the Bible God) - when calamity overtakes you like a storm* (*please read carefully it doesnt say when I send calamity! but when it happens the SOB Bible God takes advantage of it! God is also at the mercy of the weather conditions! You need to have a very low IQ to qualify as a minister of the Word of God!), when disaster sweeps over you like a whirlwind, when distress and trouble overwhelm you. Then they will call to me but I will not answer; they* (*Gods people) will look for me but will not find me* (* yeah, what do I have to do with all that?).    There goes the Im with you to the end or is it only a joke? This God is real only in the clever mind of the Bible writers     Jeremiah 11: 14 "Do not pray for this people nor offer any plea or petition for them, BECAUSE I* (*God) WILL NOT LISTEN WHEN THEY CALL TO ME IN THE TIME OF THEIR DISTRESS.    Nothing scares primitive religious people more than the idea that their God doesnt listen to them! It still works today! The Christian idea that this whimsical God always listens to them is wishful hoping that the chances are just right that God will answer on the spot, or later on, or never! It is just like praying to a stick or a rock or any other more benevolent Heathen God and getting the SAME IDENTICAL RESULT!    Romans 9:11-15  Yet, before the twins were born or had done anything good or badin order that God's purpose in election might stand: not by works but by him who callsshe was told, The older will serve the younger. Just as it is written: Jacob* (*Israel) I loved, but Esau* (*Arabs) I hated.  What then shall we say? IS GOD UNJUST? NOT AT ALL!* (*Saint Paul says so because he is telling you!)  For he says to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.* (*the Christian clergy preaches you all the opposite that God is no respecter of persons when he is on record to be very picky just for the heck of it!)      Malachi 1:4  (NIV) Edom* (*Esau Arabs) may say, "Though we have been crushed, we will rebuild the ruins."  But this is what the LORD Almighty says: "They may build, but I will demolish. They will be called the Wicked Land, A PEOPLE ALWAYS UNDER THE WRATH OF THE LORD* (*How would you like to be one of them? No FREE WILL FOR YOU! NO Salvation, either! God doesnt like you for ever just for the heck of it!)    Isaiah 45:7 (infallible King James Version) I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and CREATE EVIL: I the LORD* (*NOT SATAN, but God) do all these things.    Job 42:11 (infallible King James Version) Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over ALL THE EVIL that the LORD* (*NOT SATAN, BUT GOD!) had brought upon him:* (*God had a plan to have ALL of Jobs children slaughtered! The heck with family love and affection!!! Isnt God so wonderful?! Life is so cheap in the Bible!)    When was the last time that a Christian blamed God for any of his/her misfortune? I bet they only credit Satan for their misfortunes!

You are welcome to email me anytime should you need help with a question or just wish to talk in general.|`|aGRJ6MPdaa	After perusing some of the answers, I had to comment on a few of them. You can really get a broad picture if you pay attention;    "Jehovah witnesses made many false prophecies... Everything I said I can PROVE with their own magazines (the sentinel) and other publications of them." -I happen to know this is true. I have seen many of these publications myself.    "www.watchthetower.com is a site from ex-jehovah's witness" -You have to ask yourself why former Jehovah's Witnesses have their own website; and guess what- this isn't the only one! There are dozens more! I am a member of two of them!    "...be careful on yahoo. There's alot of prejudice sources on here." -Yahoo isn't the only place! I wonder why so many are "prejudiced" against JWs? Hmmm...    "If I wanted to know about you I wouldn't go and ask someone that doesn't like you and makes up lies about you. I would ask you." -This works both ways when someone has something to hide! Would you ask Adolf Hitler about his agenda or would you ask someone who defected from Germany?    "I will say that there are tons of false stories about us everywhere." -Yes, especially from JWs themselves who try to hide the organization's embarrassing past and evidence of their qualifications as a false prophet according to Deuteronomy 18:20-22!    "Not for nothing did the Apostle Paul show that the good news has been veiled for a long time and minds have been blinded." -Yes, and there are none so blind as JWs who cannot see because of the pile of propagandist JW literature all around them. No wonder the Sept 2007 KM told you not to use outside sources for Bible research!    "I therefore tell it how it is and this is hard for many JW's to handle." -As do I, Wee John; as do I!    "You will receive many answers on here that are negative toward us." -Gee, I wonder why?    "Just for the record - we believe that Jesus is the mediator for ALL people not just a select few (as one of the previous answers mistakenly said)" -Oh, really!? Then why did your organization print this statement; "Likewise, the Greater Moses, Jesus Christ, is not the Mediator between Jehovah God and all mankind. He is the Mediator between his heavenly Father, Jehovah God, and the nation of spiritual Israel, which is limited to only 144,000 members."

Note with what seriousness he makes this point at 2?Corinthians 4:3, 4: If, now, the good news we declare is in fact veiled, it is veiled among those who are perishing, among whom the god of this system of things has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, that the illumination of the glorious good news about the Christ, who is the image of God, might not shine through.    Take for instance John 1:1- some see it as John writing that Jesus here is shown as the Creator- or God. Yet if the same John could later write under inspiration at John 20:17- showing that Jesus has a God- then who is confused?  Either We misunderstand John 1:1 or misunderstand John 20:17- which one is it? The words coming from Jesus show that he had already experienced Death.   The words at John 20: 17 would seem to be beyond Doubt that Jesus has a God- unlike John 1:1- when one considers how John identified the Word in the first chapter of his Gospel. The Word became flesh and resided among us, he wrote, and we had a view of his glory, a glory such as belongs [not to God but] to an only-begotten son from a father. So the Word, who became flesh, lived on the earth as the man Jesus and was seen by people.

I was raised Catholic and became one a witness 15 years ago. I will say, they put the Bible and God's standards before their own ideas or decisions even when some persecute them for it (and despite claims, we decide to put God first, not because we are brain-washed, but because we love Him and after research and reasoning see the benefit of our path) ..as Peter says, "We obey God as ruler rather than men". -Acts 5:29. But really, we are a pretty normal group of people that are trying to do our best to please him and live through the future judgment soon to come. Ask your friend for a Bible Study, even with another witness if you feel it may jeopardize your friendship. But in short, despite being different from the norm, I think it's a most rewarding  to be one.|`|rcCsFXpoaa	I was a JW for over 22years so i feel i have an understanding of this religion.  Many current JW's will dispute this because i have left of my own free will (and with the help of the Holy Spirit).    I therefore tell it how it is and this is hard for many JW's to handle.      The Witnesses are taught that there are two distinct classes of Christians in their organization. These two  classes of Christians do not share a common relationship with God through Christ, nor do they share a common  hope. Yet, according to their view, each group is fully Christian and fully acceptable to God through Jesus  Christ. At the outset, it must be pointed out that this contradicts a basic Christian tenet, namely, that Christians  are called in the one hope to which you were called. (Eph. 4:4 NW) All Christians share a common hope  of future spiritual life.1 Cor. 15    Their society teach that only a select few have the privilege of calling Jesus their mediator....this is not what the bible teaches(1Tim2:3-5).    They will not tell you this until you have been indoctrinated, but they believe that if you have heard their versions of what the truth is on God's purpose, yet refuse to become a baptized JW, then you will be destroyed at Armageddon. They have been using this scare tactic for over 100years now.    Unfortunately for you, if you start a bible study with your friend and then decide to reject her version of the truth, then she will cut your friendship off, as you are now lost and deserve to die at Armageddon.Forgive her though as this is not her idea...it's what they are told to do from their society of scare mongers.    Ask her and see what she says|`|BzrUWCsDaa	You will receive many answers on here that are negative toward us. If you look through the questions & answers of those who are negative towards us you will find that some are bordering on obsessional anti-JW propaganda. Much of the information is false too.    All I can say is, I wasn't raised a Jehovah's Witness. I've always had a respect for the bible but could not fully understand it.. that is until I met Jehovah's Witnesses. I was sceptical at first but everything they believed was supported by scripture (my own copy of the bible) & I came to truly know God's personality & purposes for the earth & mankind. I've never looked back.   Go with your instinct & continue looking into what we believe etc & ignore all the negative things you hear. You wont regret it.      edit..

Why are there so many religions or beliefs?  Why do we need religion or God?  Why religions caused so much problems?  When will mankind's sufferings ever come to an end?  Is there a true religion?  Does God accept all forms of religions?  How many Gods are there?  What is God's name?  What's in it for me if I worship God?  If I worship God, do I go to heaven at death?  What's God's purpose for mankind?  Is this all that is, for me to be born, grow up, go to school, get a job, get marry, raise family, grow old, and die?  Or is there better life for me that I am unaware of?    How would you answer this question:  If you can live forever in a beautiful peaceful paradise, free from pains, sufferings, old age, and death, would you like it or hate it?      Jesus was a perfect man.  He never did wrong to anyone, still many people hated him.  Due to imperfection, would one or all Jehovah's Witnesses expect their neighbors to like them?  No.  They all well aware that they are not greater than Jesus.  But they are expected to show love for all their neighbors (different religions and backgrounds) even to love their enemies and to pray for them to come to accurate of knowledge of God.|`|c3zUqmdXaa	Jehovah witnesses made many false prophecies. They said the patriarchs would raised of the dead in 1975, the same year that would occur the battle of armagedom. Their first leader, Russel, predicted Jesus' coming back over 4 times. The first one was to 1914. Nothing happend and after his death, Jehovah witnesses under control of another leader started preaching that Jesus came back in 1914, but he reign invisiblely. to defend themselves about their mistakes and contradiction, they sau Jehovah teaches his people "progressivelly" with "new sights" or "new lights".   The new world translation, their unique and official bible version, is completely corrupted; (at least about the new testament I can witness). I study the greek of the new testament and so I can witness they deliberately change many verses, mainly the ones that shows clearly Jesus' divinity. Examples: Jo 1:1; Titus 2:13; Acts 20:28 (compare their translation with anyother translation). They want to convince us that their translation is the only correct one even being the only one that desagree at all with all version in many idioms, from many different centuries and countries. To confirm that their translation is arbitrary is simple: Just get one version before 1964 and read Heb 1:8 where God, the Father command the angel to WORSHIP Jesus. Then, get one recent version and read the same verse and find something like "pay homage". They changed the verses which shows Jesus clearly being worshiped that they can support their doctrine which teaches Jesus is not al-mighty, but just "a god". Rutherford, his founder, worshiped Jesus and said it's right to do. Just examine their history and check that they changed/change their doctrines like someone who changes his colothes. They always have a new teaching.   Besides that all, it's not persecution, but anyone out of their organization can see clearly that their way of teaching people is nothing but a brain washing. They make people be scary about asking so much. They make people think that question is of devil. They do their best to make their members be as far as possible from religious chat and informations generally. They make people think that anyone who tries to convince them that they are wrong are just apostates sent by devil. It's like you were in Eden and I was devil trying to make you fall in my conversation, so no matter how many proofs and evidences I give you that you are wrong, you won't even think about what I say. Your mind is already manipulated to think I'm wrong cause I'm sent by the own devil.   They also harmed many people, include children, telling them they couldn't get vaccine cause it's of devil (now they changed it). They already made many children die for refusing blood transfusion. Even nowadays it still happens with adults. Jehovah witnesses is just a DANGEROUS SECT.

I am a Disassociated Witness and so do have some problems with some of their doctrines but I also admit to my guilt as to why I was kicked out.

I began my training to become a Missionary when I was 12 and he is full of cr@p.   He distorts many facts.   One of the main ones was that the Watchtower is written by men who claim to recieve info from Angels. BULL    The ultimate authority is God and he only speaks to us through the Bible.   The Watchtower is actually nothing more that a study aid addressing many questions concerning doctrine.  The Witnesses, at least those who are training to become missionarys or go dooor to door are encouraged to read and study any Bible.     Yes they do believe the New World Translation is the truest translation, however many Witnesses also own a copy of the  King James Version as this is the widest accepted translation of the Bible.     Any Witness worth his salt can match anyone else when using the King James to prove their beliefs.

I think most reasonable people would say a nine-month fetus, ready to be born, viable outside the mother, is a HUMAN BEING.  But I think these same reasonable people would say a fertilized egg, invisible to the human eye, a single cell with no organs, no heart, no consciousness, no feelings, no fear, that is not a person.  So the question is: where between these two extremes does life begin?    The idea that a life is created when the sperm hits the egg, that is not in the Bible, it is not a technical 'fact'. In fact it is an artificial and arbitrary standard, and it has more to do with politics than with morals or religious values.  It is a stake in the ground for people of faith to rally around, something they can all believe in as a tenet of their faith.  It doesn't have to be proven or defended, it just -is-.    But we know today that half or more of fertilized eggs never implant on the uterine wall.  They flush out of the woman's body with her next period, before she even knows she was pregnant.  These zygotes are not genetically viable, they had no chance to develop into human beings.  This is sometimes called a 'spontaneous abortion'.  Do you believe God would kill half or more of all 'humans' this way?    But the problem is, if we don't recognize this standard, then where do we draw the line?    Perhaps we could draw it at the beginning of brainwaves.  Before the fetus begins to make brainwaves, it has no consciousness, no personality, feels no pain, no fear, etc.  We see the -end- of brainwave activity as the -end- of life--nobody has ever come back from 'brain death'.  So why not see the other end as the beginning of life?    This happens around the end of the first trimester.  So if we allowed abortion up to that point, it would give a woman 6 weeks or so to realize that she's pregnant, and another 2 or 3 weeks to talk it over with her husband or boyfriend, her family, her doctor, her spiritual leader, and make a decision.   After the first trimester it should be harder to get an abortion, it should take some really good reason, like danger to the health of the mother, severe birth defect, something like that.     Just an idea.    The whole pro-life movement, as we talk about the issue today, is not an issue of values and religious faith, it is a political issue.  The way politicians and the media talk about it is phony.  The issue can never be resolved because the Republican Party is trying to milk maximum political mileage from it, which by now they pretty much have.|`|J7KSKm54aa	Morally~ 15 weeks|`|VmGcNErkaa	between 52 and 520|`|93galWG1aa	Sure proof Abortion is wrong.  http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=NzQUtElQXX...

This sounds about right to me, as after that the fetus would be able to survive outside the womb, and at that point I think it's too late to abort (of course there will always be medical emergencies). Before then it is debateable about how much suffering the fetus goes through, but I would much rather give scared or ill women the chance they deserve. Plus, most abortions here are done in the first twelve weeks, often with non-surgical methods- so it's not a case of leaving it until the last minute when the fetus could suffer because the majority of the aborted fetuses don't have a nervous system yet.    For those who feel abortion should never be legal, what about those women who were raped? I think it's absolutely disgusting that some people think it is better or more moral to force a woman to carry an unwanted child when it is a reminder of a traumatic event, and she might end up going crazy or neglecting or abusing the child because she resents it. I don't know how people dare dictate what happens in a woman's life like that- to force a woman to carry an unwanted child can ruin the lives of both her and the child, plus those of any close family or the father of the child.

And if you do abort the baby before the 10 weeks it should only be because the baby is a result of rape, or it may not have a good life due to some complication it has.   (You can probably tell i'm against abortion...).    EDIT  Ok so this is kinda going off topic (I apologise OP) but this is aimed at those saying that abortion should NEVER be allowed, in certain circumstances wouldn't it be better if the baby was aborted. I am pro life myself, but if the baby is a result of rape or the mothers life is in danger or the baby will be born with a very serious illness or something like that. Well wouldn't abortion be better in this case?   My personal belief is that people shouldn't abort a baby for financial reasons or career before family. But in some circumstances it would be better for their own or the babys well being if the baby was aborted.   Every circumstance is different, and people have different reasons for doing this.

EDIT:  as far as rape goes, most women who have an abortion after being raped see it as a second rape.  Women who have kept the baby, have actually found it to be a type of healing.

Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16.

In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23.

When it comes to FAITH, it's just the opposite. Believing is Seeing.    FAITH, VIRTUE OF  The infused theological virtue whereby a person is enabled to "believe that what God has revealed is true -- not because its intrinsic truth is seen with the rational light of reason -- but because of the authority of God who reveals it, of God who can neither deceive nor be deceived" (First Vatican Council, Denzinger 3008).     FAITH  The acceptance of the word of another, trusting that one knows what the other is saying and is honest in telling the truth. The basic motive of all faith is the authority (or right to be believed) of someone who is speaking. This authority is an adequate knowledge of what he or she is talking about, and integrity in not wanting to deceive. It is called divine faith when the one believed is God, and human faith when the persons believed are human beings. (Etym.

E.g. if you sell products which are not good for people, you'll loose your clients. You shall do that business over a period of time & next you'll change the activity, or what? Someday you shall change as well your Name. Is that any good? You've put your employees to lie in the favor of your bad products, and you've lost!  E.g. if you keep your employees to work in the weekends, they'll be no longer productive the next week - such where is the good part for the business vs. people's belief (Sabbath)??? Or they shall have quarrels in their family (relationship) and *puff* their motivation/concentration.    IF you do think that your business consists in your people (employees & clients) then everything shall be good, really. This doesn't mean there shall not be tough periods, not quite good for everyone, but as long as you do consider people within the company and/or your clients as a family ... you have all the chances to be a success. You can help with relocation into a new job for your employee & not only with a referee in bad times :( You can help with some connecting collateral services recommendations for your products sold. Show your concern to your client, for their needs :)    ... because THERE IS NOTHING bad for PEOPLE (whatever their believes !!!) which shall not be ALSO BAD FOR THE BUSINESS. Business means People.

The bible was written in an age where tribe size was of the utmost importance. All sexual energy was directed towards filling women with babies as early and as often as possible; all other sexual behavior was criminalized.    It was a practical matter, and had nothing to do with morality. In fact, quite the contrary; homosexuality isn't immoral - it hurts nobody. Homophobia hurts and sometimes kills - that's what's immoral.    Christians can't reconcile the idea of a fair god with those barbaric laws, so they have to pretend that homosexuality is an immoral act (it isn't), a choice (it isn't - if you think it is, can you tell me about when you made the choice?), and unnatural (it's not - it's observed in many animal species).    You could argue that in today's overpopulated world, heterosexuality should be the 'sin'.    P.S. When the priests came to arrest Jesus, a young man who was with him dropped his linen cloth and "fled from them naked" (Mark 14:51-52).

They are not. Everybody has their cross, their temptation, their special pluses and minuses. Look at alcoholics, drug users, pyromaniacs, etc.     We are like people on the rim of a bike wheel and Jesus and Godliness is at the center. Maybe the gay thing is your problem, maybe it isn't.

He says homosexuality is wrong.  God did not make them gay no more than He made me a thief or alcoholic, but He says those actions are wrong and I am to stop it.  People in general have a superstitious and un-biblical view of God. He is not sitting up in heaven dishing out "this and that" in our lives.  We are free moral agents living in an era where we told God, back in the Garden of Eden, "stay out of our lives and let us rule ourselves".  Until He intervenes we are victims of time and chance and smart decisions and dumb decisions.  it is us, not Him.  Whether homosexuality is a choice or not is irrelevant, it is that persons "cards" to be dealt with and God does not hate that person and neither should we.

Just because there are people who rant about going to hell or spending eternity in hell or about predestination ("He knows who we will be and what we will become") doesn't mean we have it all figured out.  He knows why, we don't.  He has it figured out.  One of the conditions of this life is that we do not know everything.  We live to a large extent in the dark.  And we certainly don't get to know everyone else's business (like what will happen to gays, for example).  Much better if we occupy ourselves will living well, as well as we can and helping others, rather than trying to  judge God.  Don't you think that in judging Him we will like be wrong--and ashamed?  Consider this, all the good things in this life, life itself, air to breath, good experiences (it's not all bad).  What are the good things God has done?  The ultimate question your are reaching for is this, Why is there evil and suffering? God's answer, for now, is Christ on the cross (that is, He was willing to suffer for us in His Son). The rest we'll have to wait for.|`|VhmBMJKxaa	God loves everyone unconditionally, despite religion, race, or sin. That is true love. I believe that there are some things, like murder, that are wrong but God allows these things to happen and forgives the sinner for it. Everything that is created has a purpose, someone will learn something, some sort of lesson, from every single thing that happens in the world.    I believe that over the years, man has embellished and/or altered the original word of God to fit his or her own individual purpose. This doesn't make them bad people, it just makes them human. After all, has it been proven that when a story is passed from one person to the next, each person is different so the story is different each time. It is highly possible that the original word of God has been changed over the centuries, by either accident or design.    I believe that making someone feel guitly for their life choices is very very wrong. Everyone is different and God loves everyone for exactly who they are. Should we not do the same?|`|RhkKGsipaa	God loves everyone.|`|8b35140fd5eabcceff1f6c71562a2a02aa	Bless you Amber.  If you read scripture you will notice that God finds the practise of homosexuality 'detestable' it is NOT the people he finds detestable, please please understand this.    I dont believe God creates gay people.  In that case, someone who murders or abuses children could say the same - that God made them like that, but then that takes away their responsibility for their actions.    I know you will say - yes but murder and child abuse and stealing etc are different - being gay does not hurt anyone.  But it does hurt God's heart, as that is not his original design for you.    I know of some people who have been healed of their homosexual desires and tendencies but I also know of a story of a girl who after being born again still had a desire for women and chose to be single and celibate.  I wish I could remember the name of the book.    And what you have to remember is WE HAVE ALL DONE THINGS that displease God.  The Book of Romans tells us that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.  Lying displeases God and he feels very strongly about this and liars are listed in the same group as sexually immoral people in the Book of Revelation. I just want to get this a bit into perspective for you.    I will remember to pray for you.  And remember GOD LOVES YOU.  YOU are VERY special to him.  He will meet you at your point of need if you pray to him.   All the best x|`|QM0Ezfvnaa	One can hate a BEHAVIOR while not hating the one that displays the hated behavior. For instance, I love my children but hate the behavior that damages their health and long life (smoking).    We are all God's children and He loves each of us just that way . . . even the ones who display the disgusting behavior that the Bible condemns (homosexuality).    Free will allows us to choose to love and please God . . . it means so much more to Him than if we had no choice. He did not create us as slaves but as His children. His loving us means He gives us the free will to choose our way - even if we choose a way that hurts Him.

God didn't create Adam and Steve, but Adam and Eve. Homosexuality is a perversion of something GOOD, as is any sin that you can name. The PRACTICE of perversion is a learned practice, and something that can and should be STOPPED. as it has consequences that we can both see and not see, according to the Bible.    All of us are born IN SIN and headed for hell. If we don't take God up  on His offer of the GIFT of righteousness which can be found by ANYONE who believes/trusts in the death, burial and resurrection of Christ as Gods ONLY solution to the sin problem for ALL of us, then we simply stay on the course we were all born in.    ALL have sinned, the Bible tells us. ALL are guilty of death. However, Jesus came to pay the price for all of us and Gods testimony says that His sacrifice WAS SUFFICIENT for all of us! If we believe what He says is true, then we can have a guarantee of entrance into heaven based on the performance of Christ on the Cross.    If God disliked anyone, He would not have died to pay the penalty that WE owed, would He?    He cannot let sin into His holy heaven. So He paid the price for all of it, so that those who will trust in His provision can enter IN, on the righteousness of ANOTHER...namely Jesus Christ.

If you believe in God and his word then you believe that he doesn't create gays, it's a lifestyle choice. For in Leviticus he states that lifestyle along with incest and beastiallity is an abomination to him. Leviticus18:22    He created us knowing what we would chose but he didnt create us to chose what he wanted. Its free will.  He doesn't hate gay people. He hates their lifestyle. Its sinful.

Now look at us.|`|ChmwmQfWaa	People are not born gay to start with, and I'd give u evidences for dat:    In Genesis 2:23-24 it says The man said "This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman, for she was taken out of man." "For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his WIFE and they'll become one flesh". This proves to u dat God created them man and woman not d way around.  Also in d Gensis 19:6-29(Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah) if u check a Bible or Google a Bible. God sent two of his angels to destroy d city because of their homosexuality and Lot and his family were d only ones spared bcos they remianed righteous.This means God is against people being gay and it's a sin before him, this is similar to d story of Noah    So he COULDNT hav possibly created people gay.  If u check Romans 1:18-27, Paul speaking. It tells u dat ppl being gay is as a result of God's wrath upon mankind, and dat's wat ppl are modernising and classifyin as something acceptable today.  Verse 27 says "In d same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another.Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due PENALTY for their perversion."  So God doesnt claim to dislike gays, because being gay was a punishment during the time of Paul, because ppl wud obvioulsy had been persecuted for it as it was unnatural.  So d "option to be condemned" is freewill like u said, ppl choose their paths, God has told us everything we need in d Bible and He wont force his opinion on u, if u know d right thing and dont do it, then d rest is up to u and d penalty wud follow.

To ur additional question  People wouldnt know they are attracted to certain sex, d same God dat created us all to be attracted to d opposite sex not same sex. So they fact dat ppl are speakin out and sayin dat u can be attracted to d same sex is as a result of societal influence (behaviourist in psychology), they r learning from their environment. Ppl become gay bcos they either dont know how to attract d particular person of d opposite sex or are either shy.And bisexual is as a result of people CONFORMING to norms in d society and tryin out things for themselves  And to prove to u dat there's a God and opposing force(devil)check Ephesians 6:12. If u think there's no oppsing force, hav u ever wondered why things dont work for u at times and ppl get involved in accidents and bad stuff happening. Do u think there's no opposing force to God, this is hence d reason for the 'so expected' end of d world, judgement day, rapture... u've heard of them, rite. Wars going on and yet there's no opposing force. Besides if u say there's no God  Who created u or d universe? Big Bang?nah i doubt it  How did d Big Bang happen? particles?  Where did particles or wateva it is originate from? we cud go on and on  Hav u wondered who designed ur nerves, brain, heart, especially when u consider dat and who is in control of d sun and moon and everything?Where do d sun and moon go to and know when to come out (Gen 1:1-5)  U CANT EXPLAIN ALL DAT, CAN U?  So how can there be no God?Cmon  If u need more info email me thru my profile    **************************************...    I'm sorry Amber if my answer offended u in anyway, I dont know everything, but I'm just telling what I know as a Christian. It's also not my opinion because I didnt write d Bible but have only been taught about it from church, so it's not really my opinion; the facts I can provide for u are from d Bible.I gave u quite a number of Bible verses to support my answer as everyone else have done, where else would u hav expected evidence from a christian except d Bible?  God is d author of d Bible but it was written by man; this was done through Him revealing it to them. The Bible was written by so many different prophets as time went on.Like Genesis and Exodus was written by Moses for example.It's more like God speaking his mind to man through revelations and man just writes down wat he's told, dat's it basically.I'd give u an evidence from d Bible in Habbakuk 2:2-3, of God speaking to Habbakuk, it says "write down d revelation and make it plain on tablets so dat a herald may run with it. For d revelation AWAITS an appointed time; it speaks of the END and will not prove false. Though it linger, wait for it; it'll certainly come and will not delay".(prophecies to say)    That's a fact there, bcos I dont know wat else u want me to give.And I dont know of animals mating with d same sex is I may conclude, dat's a new one I'm hearing.The Bible makes us understand dat animales 'fell' as well when Adam and Eve disobeyed God and their nature changed unlike when the wolf used to live with d lamb etc.It says in Romans 8:19-21 dat creation itself can hardly wait till d new heaven and earth(after judgement day and all) and in verse 20 says "For d creation was subjected to frustration, not by its choice but by d will of d one who subjected it, in hope". There's an opposing force to d goodwill of nature( devil) and d same force manifests in animals  Dats all I'd say, let me know wat u think?  God Bless  PS-I dont really know how my grammar is offending, it's not like it's sophisticated or has a rude tone in anyway, could u let me know what u find offensive abt it?I'm just letting u know what i've learned from being a christian, TOTALLY not my opinion; in so doing answering d questions u hav about my religion and giving u logical explanations. Afterall I also looked at d psychological view to support this, I learnt dat as well from school, not my opinion, It's Asch research on conformity, not mine at all.Besides we'r all learning, u didnt know dats y u asked and I'm answ

They said the white people got to live in the best areas, get the best jobs, and vote, rule the country, get the money, etc.  The black people had to go live in the back of beyond, not be real citizens, didn't get to vote, and couldn't be well educated, etc., etc.  Then there were some people who had mixed ancestry or who came from India or Pakistan.  They were labeled "colored" and they got to live in a sort of no-man's land in between.  They could have a few rights and get some jobs but not the best ones.  They could live in certain areas but not others.  Mohandas K. Gandhi, who later went to India and led that country to independence, began the fight to end this brutal and unjust regime.  It took a long time but it has finally ended.  Nelson Mandela spent over 20 years in prison for trying to end it and eventually became the prime minister of South Africa.    In Afrikaans, a dialect of Dutch, the word "apartheid" essentially means something like "separation" or "segregation."|`|mUK240ykaa	"Apartheid is an Afrikaans word meaning "separation" or "being apart". It is usually used to describe a policy that existed in South Africa from 1948 to 1994. This system was used to mistreat and deny rights to non-white people. The laws allowed the white minority to keep the black majority out of certain areas without special papers or permission. School subjects for Africans had to be taught in Afrikaans."    "The people who wanted Apartheid wanted all people with different colored skin to live in different places. They said that people from different places should always be kept apart when they were in cities. The Apartheid government in South Africa wanted to move people to make them separate. They sometimes forced people out of their home to do this."    "Apartheid was started in 1948 when the 'National Party' won a vote to decide who should lead the country. After the National Party won it separated people in beaches, buses, hospitals, schools and universities. In the 1950s lots of laws were made to separate people."    "One of the first laws that were created to separate people said that non white people could not marry white people. This law was made in 1949. Ten years after this, a law was made to stop non white people going to universities for white people."|`|njrKjJVwaa	Apartheid (meaning separateness in Afrikaans cognate to English apart and -hood) was a system of legal racial segregation enforced by the National Party government of South Africa between 1948 and 1994.|`|nvlgBFTvaa	Apartheid is racial segregation, including politcal and social aspects.

NwIwQoKyaa	I'm going to answer from the perspective of a student. It doesn't sound like you're looking to go this deep into the languages, but just in case, I'm going to go a bit in-depth just to cover all angles. Particularly since if you wanted to attend some college in Belgium (they refer to it as university; college is like high school for them) you may be required to learn the language, and the standard requirement seems to be 5 levels. That's a lot of work. Some things are offered in English, but only a few at select schools. If you're looking for a Master degree, though, that's less likely to be a problem, ironically. Quite a few of those are offered in English, and that would give you plenty of time to learn Dutch and/or French.    I'm taking a Dutch course in Leuven, an intensive one that's much faster than the norm. It takes about a year or maybe 3/4 of a year for the full course to finish because of the vacation time in between, usually about two weeks, but with a two-month break in the summer. You could take both French and Dutch at college at the same time, although that's a recipe for some serious headaches and a lot of self-study.     If you want to really thoroughly learn the languages, like so that you're near-perfect for every normal conversation you'll have, to the point where you'll impress people with how good your grasp of their tongue is and you'll be able to understand news broadcasts and stuff, then you'll want to take niveaus 1 through 5 at least. If you study on your own first you can go faster by taking a test to see what level they'll place you at, but to be perfectly honest, that's an invitation to make many mistakes that will then be harder to correct (people in Belgium use many different dialects by region, so you may learn phrases, expressions, and words that don't exist in the languages proper {both French and Dutch}). You may end up in a high-level course and then have to take it twice or even three times just to pick up on all the rules and weird expressions you didn't learn the first time. But of course, for everyday speaking that's not necessary.     Let me warn you that those who are non-native English speakers (from multiple countries and languages of origin) have been saying that Dutch is a LOT harder than English to learn. Not harder than German, definitely not, but still quite tricky. I've seen some very bright students drop out in the first few weeks of the second level. Even a person with a sharp, quick brain can end up struggling. Dutch has a lot more words with multiple meanings than English, the prepositions (and other words) are in some cases the same but used differently which gets quite confusing, and a lot of the language is based on words which get split up and moved to different parts of the sentence. There are also four past tense forms of those splittable words. Like for instance, aanemen becomes nam aan for imperfect singular, namen aan for imperfect plural, and aangenomen for perfect. 80% of words take hebben, but the rest take zijn, and it's not immediately apparent which.  There's not precisely a logic for it either. The language has male, female, and non-gendered words; I don't know if that would make more sense to a Spanish speaker. For me it's a bit frustrating, but not unmanageable. Knowing English can trip you up in places, but it can also make other things easier.     Just one quick example of Dutch compared to English... "Ik heb zin in (something)" means literally "I have sense in," and figuratively you would end that sentence with coffee, or a short break, or something else you would enjoy having at this moment. Zin also, however, means a sentence. A lot of Dutch is the same words relying on context alone to make sense.     The nice and simultaneously frustrating thing is, Flemish people really try to speak to you in your language to make you feel at home. If you struggle with Dutch, they will try to identify your accent. If they know only twenty words of your language, they will valiantly struggle with those twenty words and try the best that they can to communicate. Otherwise, they may default to English. That makes it harder to practice, so you've got to be committed enough to politely refuse to speak English, or linger especially in conversation with those who don't know English at all.     But don't let me scare you off with this--especially if you just want to go to Belgium for a vacation or to live for a while and see how you like the place rather than go for a bachelor psych degree or something (that requires level 5). And if you do want to be a student, the cost of education in Belgium is drastically, drastically better (although, not the prices of clothes and such.) The fact that there are so many English-speakers and English-dabblers in Belgium can also be a tremendous advantage for learning by ear and conversation as you did with English; they can help you a lot by translating what they're saying. If you enjoy a linguistic challenge, Dutch|`|qn9NilP3aa	If you know Spanish, you'll easily be able to pick up French because Spanish and French share a lot of grammar rules and a lot of words that mean the same thing in Spanish and French are similar (such as "verde" and "vert".) But I do have to warn you that pronouncing French can be really confusing when you start learning it.    I don't know about Dutch, but if you learned English in 6 months, it shouldn't take too long.|`|7360955bdb6204c33b9cfd068b9d6cf7aa	you leartn fast, you'll have no problem for French, or Dutch, probably 6 months each|`|gOGdCBByaa	It might take a little longer for both languages but it will still go quite fast)watch out for pronounciations, they are hard in both languages!)

e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	It's not our place to say who is and isn't going to hell.    Jesus said He was leaving us with one commandment:  love one another.  He also said not to judge.  Nobody knows the heart of another person except that person and God.    People who feel it is their place to pronounce judgment about who is and isn't "saved" seem very arrogant and far from the Gospel.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	Jesus is the Only Way to Heaven.    In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16.

Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23.

No.    For all anyone knows disbelieving in the popular cult notions which everyone mutually agrees upon as being "God" may be the calling of God himself.    Just because everyone thinks a certain way about God, doesn't make it true, just as everyone believing the earth was flat didn't make it so.    Popularity doesn't matter. Just be good and live kindly, care for everyone you can, and let religion dig it's own grave if it must. It's not your responsibility, you have enough to handle as it is in your life.|`|AA11282654	Yes, if you believe in that sort of thing. It is very clear in every gospel I've seen.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	EVERyone sins....there are no good ppl....    hell is graves....we all go there first|`|0bOSZIzJaa	What do you think?    Most Christians would say yes, they are doomed.  Does that sound fair, just, or logical to you?      It doesn't make sense to me.|`|VmGcNErkaa	Yes we are doomed to hell... yay, that means no cover charge!|`|9mLjDa5kaa	The only way to get into heaven is by believing in Jesus without adding any of your own works.     We're all sinners. Only Jesus is acceptable payment for sins, because Jesus died on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead.     All the good deeds in the world won't pay for even ONE of your sins. All the trying to be a "good person" won't pay for even ONE of your sins. Doing "religious activites" won't pay for even ONE of your sins.     Either Jesus pays for your sins, or you pay for them in eternal torment in hell. That is the choice before you.    So believe in Jesus as God and Savior without adding any of your own works, and you're saved, that simple (John 3:16). :)|`|utbfT0APaa	Where does the knowledge of good and bad originate? If not for God we would not know. So, to leave God out of your life is to live a life of denial. To know Jesus is to know life.|`|9Q6CkSMzaa	I'm personally not Christian, but I know many Christians who give the simple answer, "You believe what we believe, you worship the one almighty God, or you go to hell. You could save lives for a living, and help people, and sacrifice everything for other people, but you will burn in hell!"    My mother, on the other hand, does not believe this is true. She believes that God will judge you on who you are--the type of person you are--not what you believe.    It just depends on the Christian. The thing is, there are so many types of Christians out there, it's an infested religion, that there is no one answer to your question. Every Christian would probably give you a different answer.|`|5ExSaZ9Qaa	In Christian Mythology, if an indivual does not believe in God. That alone will doom him to Hell. No matter how good of a person he or she may have been.|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	According to Christian beliefs, yes.  Which is why I have no use for them.    I'm an atheist.  Today I was at Walmart, and I saw an elderly woman on a bench, banging a bottle of Vitamin Water against it.  Then she was reaching for one of her gloves.  I realized she couldn't get the cap off the bottle, so I offered to help her and opened it.  Later, another older woman (don't know what was going on at the mall today with the old ladies) came to ask me to help her find mattress pads.  I pointed her in the right direction but realized I'd have to bring her to the right area; she seemed so confused.  Now, I didn't do these things becasue I thought god was watching me.  I'll never see these ladies again, most likely.  I don't believe in god, so apparently I have no morals and am going to hell.  Nice.  I wonder how many Christians ignored the woman trying to open that bottle before I came along.|`|X1jupF0paa	I believe that everybody has the opportunity to find the truth, but if you don't believe in God then why would you believe in Hell.|`|oGqssgJLaa	According to reformed christian faith, specially present in evangelical and pentecostal churches, they would.|`|R8oS6LB3aa	According to your Christian belief system, yes.|`|VL0FwgaOaa	If you believe that the only way to heaven is through salvation then yes.|`|eb51db6616f7c8199ef567345fea8d15aa	The atheist doesn't believe in hell.

By who's standards?      The truth is:  God will not let ANYTHING unholy into heaven.  Or else it would become as corrupt as earth.    When you think of God, know that he is love... and everything he does, or lets happen is for a plan, with love as the motive behind it all.  Everyone falls short of the goodness of God.  If we could somehow get into heaven on our own merit, Jesus wouldn't have had to sacrifice his life for the wrongs that you have done.  He took your place, to atone for the sin.      The most beautiful gift God gave us, aside from his son, was the knowledge that we don't have to judge anyone.  That every judgement is just, and it's not ours to make.|`|e43hjVI6aa	It depends on how they lived their life. If that person was not brought up to a certain religion, and they decided they absolutley hated God or whatever, then yes - they would go to hell.|`|9btru19waa	Yes, because we are not saved by our works, we are saved by faith in Jesus Christ. If we could save ourselves, Jesus would not have had to die for us. God gave us his laws, not because he thought we could obey them, but to show us just how much we aren't obeying them, because of the sin that is in us.     So he has given us this new way to be saved, not by obeying the law, but by having faith in Jesus Christ to save us. This is the 'Good News'.  Read Romans in the Holy Bible, it tells how in detail.     If you speak modern English, get a New Living translation of the Holy Bible, because it is translated into modern English.    If you speak 16th Century old English, then you will need a King James version of the Holy Bible, because it is translated into 16th century old English.|`|d7FP0VmDaa	Live a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones." ~   Marcus Aurelius    This quote kinda sums it all up for me.|`|XcQs1Y3Jaa	From all books I red I understood that we all will meet God and His judgement when we die. This is why we should study and practise our religion in order to be prepared for that unique meeting.   Religion is not only about being good. What is good for you maybe is bad for your neighbour. Religion is about understanding of why we live, what is the purpose of living.   Religion(s) say that the biggest mistake is not to feel fear of God. It is very sad that so many people believe that Death is some kind of "turning off the light" and are very proud to say they are not afraid of Death and not believe in God and any religion.. All these people will face Death completely unprepared. They will face God but will not be able to recognise Him. I am sorry to say but in my opinion these atheists are just ignorants or lazy as religious books are not so ease to read and understand. It is not a bed time story.

bTA5ndeMaa	About hell, the teaching is clear that death is the punishment, not torment evermore.    Judgment, it is already written on the globe - everywhere.

Meanwhile church folks up in heaven laughing and calling down to us atheists "I told you so."    And all the toilets in heaven flush into holy divine pipes, and all that poop is piped to hell, where it is heated to 500 degess and dumped on the atheists.

However alot of times these subjects are just being taught because they are a part of God's word, and a responsible teacher must teach the whole truth  not just the parts that are easy to take.  Often it is the case that those listening even to a genuine teacher who's just teaching the word as it is given and just happens to have come to that part of scripture, Just find it hard to deal with , so instead of accepting it as a sinceir lesson they just assume that God is mean and the teacher is being judgmental.  When in fact the listener has just been to eager to condemn the word ,and the teachers before they have showed up often to hear the whole message of the gospel ((( for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten son that whosoever would believe in Him shall not parrish but have everlasting life.)))....... That's the real message .... the judgment is only for those who persist in rejecting the devinne hope that we Have in Jesus , Gods truth You must realize that God is not a liar if He says He'll save you then He'll save you . You just need to trust Him ,and quit fighting against Him. thanks for the great and inspiring question  God bless|`|GtazNrplaa	Yes|`|E9chZY74aa	No, it done out of love and concern.

You've established that you are not sexuality attracted to boys but are you emotionality attracted?    Ends up I am not straight, and I don't like guys. When I was younger I saw that every girl liked guys so I followed the trend and forced myself to be with one. Never really liked them though, it wad just an admiration thing. Maybe you were just admiring them and it wasn't true feelings.    Time will tell what you are so don't fuss and don't feel the need to label yourself.

DvQLt59Paa	Melchizedek   king of righteousness, the king of Salem (q.v.). All we know of him is recorded in Gen. 14:1820. He is subsequently mentioned only once in the Old Testament, in Ps. 110:4. The typical significance of his history is set forth in detail in the Epistle to the Hebrews, ch. 7. The apostle there points out the superiority of his priesthood to that of Aaron in these several respects, (1) Even Abraham paid him tithes; (2) he blessed Abraham; (3) he is the type of a Priest who lives for ever; (4) Levi, yet unborn, paid him tithes in the person of Abraham; (5) the permanence of his priesthood in Christ implied the abrogation of the Levitical system; (6) he was made priest not without an oath; and (7) his priesthood can neither be transmitted nor interrupted by death: this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.      The question as to who this mysterious personage was has given rise to a great deal of modern speculation. It is an old tradition among the Jews that he was Shem, the son of Noah, who may have survived to this time. Melchizedek was a Canaanitish prince, a worshipper of the true God, and in his peculiar history and character an instructive type of our Lord, the great High Priest (Heb. 5:6, 7; 6:20). One of the Amarna tablets is from Ebed-Tob, king of Jerusalem, the successor of Melchizedek, in which he claims the very attributes and dignity given to Melchizedek in the Epistle to the Hebrews.     MISINTERPRETATION:  Genesis 14:18 says, Then Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. He was priest of God Most High. Mormons believe the Melchizedek priesthood is an eternal priesthood. Though it was lost from the earth in the early centuries of Christianity, it was restored through Joseph Smith (Smith, 1835, 107:24).|`|RC5RAzykaa	Indeed they did.    The Rabbis said that Melchizedek instructed Abraham in the Torah. (Genesis Rabbah 43:6.)    The Zohar finds in 'Melchizedek king of Salem' a reference to 'the King Who rules with complete sovereignty,' or according to another explanation, that 'Melchizedek' alludes to the lower world and 'king of Salem' to the upper world. (Zohar, Bereshit, 1:86b-87a:)     OK, maybe these are not Apocripha books, sorry. but they are extra Biblical sources.   Mecheizedek is in the Talmud as well|`|VRl1jENHaa	I'm sure they do ... but the apocryphal books are NOT divinely inspired, so what little you may be able to learn about Melchizedek would be false.  So what's the point?|`|7ff82885c9d5d1f343a4664e9d97a78aaa	The first Priest|`|LYnuEdKUaa	You're going to have to be more specific.  "apocrypha" is subjective.  What protestants consider apocrypha is different from what Catholics call apocrypha and what Orthodox call apocrypha.  The apocrypha, depending on who you ask, number from about 7 documents to a few dozen.|`|zefFTf8Aaa	yes

Nin6IawVaa	Well if you go in north sid eof india....women are taller. If they are from small town...average height can be 5'7 to 5'9. But cities girls tend to be short 5'0 to 5'3.

AA10948829	You're not going to be able to pronounce like a native unless you have a native-speaking teacher to help you. Japanese isn't tonal but there are still intonations in words that you won't catch unless you have a native-speaker who can point them out to you.  As a beginner, you should just accept that you're not going to sound like a native-speaker right away. In order to master the accent you're going to have to be in Japan and hearing it around you constantly. Japanese sounds aren't hard to get, but getting down the accent and knowing all the correct intonations isn't something you can do on your own or in your home country.|`|B7C5PPgdaa	you can enrich your Japanese Vocabulary and Kanji at http://japaneseclass.jp/ its fun! just like playing game  and its free!|`|3ibsZ4mTaa	The best way to fabricate a Japanese accent is to listen to real Japanese people speaking.

Firstly, God's heart breaks as much as humans' hearts when these terrible things happen. He doesn't want this badness and evil anymore than we do! Thats how he meant it - thats how he created the world. The first man's bad decisions not to follow the one, first rule ever made....thats what brought evil into the world.    But look. If badness didn't exist, there would be no good. I know, people will spit on that answer. But just think about it. If God evaporated all the starvation, all the disease, freak accidents, killing, murder.....there would be no measure of good. We would be lifeless, with no joy.     Evil, and bad things have to exist for there to be joy and happiness.|`|WfR6AqHiaa	no satan created all this pain and agony|`|208557bb6eec298af05daee61976e842aa	God is easily bored, the things that bother us actually make things more interesting for him.|`|A8JbIu4eaa	yes!!!!|`|TzDvl1CUaa	we were created to be a companion of god, when adam and eve were in the garden god came to vist and walk and talk with god,|`|nhZWAt8laa	Hey  ncjdwi   Great question    Well heres the good news no God doesn't delight in our suffering , in fact it brings Him to tears too,,His heart breaks as well.  Infact it was satan who brought mankind and all of creation under the curse of sin by His deception, because of his jealosy of Gods love for mankind .    God Has been working through His plan to bring it all to a renewed state of perfection , and to bring us back into a right relationship with Him ,, and jesus ,the Son of God and the very instrument of creation is God's solution.(( john 3;16.. For Gor so loved the world that He gave His only begotten son so that whosoever beleives on Him shall not parrish but have everlasting life.)))  ((Revelation 21; 4 He will wipe away every tear from their eye's . There will be no more death or  mourning or  crying or pain for the former things have passed away .. Verse(5) He who is seated on the throne said," I am making everything new")))....  These are promises from the true and living God who can't break His promises  This is good and encourageing news.  Just trust Him He'll be there for you and it is His good pleasure to bless those who love Him and trust Him. It's not about religeon it's about relationship . God wants you to have peace But He hasn't promised that we wont have hard times ,But he has promised that the hard times will come to an end .and to all who will call upon the name of the Lord and trust Him and love Him ,You will have eternal and joyfilled life in His kingdom With Him the one uncorrupt and truly just ruler of the universe... May the blessings and peace of God be yours  forever..|`|xkBXhSppaa	Little wounded one    God made everything perfect and he gave man free will so his creation  will not be mere puppets who just said they love him.God made us  because like us he does not like to be alone. BUT hey we said we don't want him and we want to be like him so there is no use of him for us when we become Gods. So his protection was a rejected and man brought suffering to this world.    Darkness was there but God overcame the darkness because he is light and the darkness can never shut him, but still this darkness operates in mysterious means hence the Angel Lucifer succumbed and became the devil and the agent of darkness. (Ignore this but this   sheds light into why there is disorder now) God protected man from this but then man said we are Gods. So God respected our wishes, but yet had a plan to save us. He was hoping we will not take this path  but we did.He also knows how all of this ends.    BUT God knows we can never win without him so he sent Jesus as a sacrifice so by his blood our sins are washed away. ( Because there is no darkness in this perfect sacrifice)We need to believe in him then only we have the right for salvation.knowing is not enough.    Suffering is common to every living thing even to GOD.Jesus suffered  and you don't know how GOD suffers in silence. Because Love always faces pain. You know this. How you love someone so much ,but yet they tend to hurt you.    NOW why do you only suffer? everyone suffers in this world but through this  we must get close to Jesus.( You only look for food when you are hungry) Forget all what the world or religion tells you.Forget it. Just say Jesus help me for I am so hurt.It is ok to cry.Pray dear one pray in your heart and in your room. Tell him to put things right in your life that you will smile and that you will have reason to believe in him and thank him. When things do start getting better remember.Seek him then read the bible in any time you can to maintain a sense of peace and to get guidance ( I speak from experience) that is why I am so convinced.  Once you have come out remember you will have to reach out to those who suffer like you did and they will believe you because you had gone through  like them and not merely saying things to make them feel good. When you reach out to heal even you are in pain that is sacrifice that is what love is, we are creatures of love NOT toys.That is the image we are created in, that is why we are lonely and hurt and sad and do crazy things. For we are love confused. He is the author of love, Love him first for his love never changes he will take you through dont reject him because he is gentle and never forces his love on us only we have to reach out. One part in your destiny is to heal those who hurt make this world a better place. This is your part.    Please read. Jeremiah 11-14  Also read Job 42:10  and also 12  Psalm 118 :5-9    God bless

First of all, what makes people think they are God's children. The Bible says only those who believe in Christ are considered "the sons of God."    Secondly, what makes anyone think "God does this"? God has in fact done everything that He can to PREVENT anyone from eternal doom. He came down here and died, for crying out loud. Let me make this perfectly clear. Those who are eternally doomed are those who FREELY CHOOSE that destination despite God's many efforts to dissuade them. Why should God rescue from Hell those who fervently INSIST on going there? Why should He interfere with anyone's freedom of choice. If He did, He'd be accused of being a Fascist -- wouldn't He?  Finally, what kind of just and loving God would not prepare a place for the Hitlers, Mansons, Stalins, Pol Pots, and Maos, the genocide killers and the child killers? What kind of God would just overlook people who do such things and refuse to change, even at the moment of their deaths?  I hope I've cleared things up. Lots of people read words like these and remain in denial of the simple truths and realities expressed by such words. But for people here in R&S, words are all I can share with you...|`|d4bd8b0d4b217939ff505d70042c7c38aa	By "religious" folks, I assume you are referring to CHRISTIANS.    It bothers me only because, like GOD, my heart wishes that EVERYONE would believe and love God as I do.  But I also have to realize that when we do get to heaven, that our "hearts" will be in "concord" (agreement) with God's, and we will understand AND AGREE with God's will that these people who are not in heaven are not there for a good reason. There is no sorrow in heaven.  Our hearts will be glad.      We will also not remember much of "this" life either.  Just as in this life, we can only glimpse "darkly" into the life after, so when we are in that after life, we will only glimpse "darkly" backwards into this life.    The Scriptures also teach us that when the Judgement Day comes... ALL people... and that MEANS ALL people ... will KNOW God, and "confess" that He exists.  Therefore, those who don't believe in God NOW WILL evetually LEARN AND CONFESS that God DOES exist.  The difference, again, is that even though they may confess that God exists (even SATAN KNOWS that God exists!) that they will REFUSE to accept God as their Lord (just as Satan refuses to do).    God doesn't punish them... THEY punish themselves by their own REFUSAL to accept God as their Lord and Savior.  This is the entire "Free Will" argumentation. Not only can God NOT tolerate sin in His presence, He also grants us the CONSEQUENCES of our CHOICE... and that consequence is not being in God's presence... ergo, being in hell.  The real punishment of hell will be the realization by those there that..."HEY... I DID have the CHOICE, and I DID REJECT God!  It's all MY FAULT for BEING here!"    There's so much more that I could go into here, to respond to the other questions you've put forth here.  You are so totally including the entire theology of Christianity here... and it's nearly impossible to answer all of them HERE with any brevity.  Might I suggest you refer to the website www.gotquestions.org where these questions and HUNDREDS more are well, fully, and thoroughly answered.      Have a blessed day.|`|yrwqHlW2aa	I think you've missed the entire message..  Everyone is born on their way to hell.  Not that innocent babies go to hell, but we are all born quickly learning that we are governed by the flesh and that is death to our soul.    God sent Jesus Christ to save us because we had no way to be good enough to earn our way to God.  Jesus is God's love for us because God saw that we were all in a hopeless condition born into sin and heading for hell.      100% of the human population deserve the punishment of hell.    God has provide a way to escape the judgment that is pending all mankind..  Here are some easy steps to follow if you wish to not only miss hell but establish a living loving relationship with the God of all creation who cares so much He sent Jesus to die in your place.    http://www.godlovestheworld.com|`|5qjxyb0jaa	It should do , many delight in the fact they condemn non believers to eternal torment in hell whilst they will be in heaven .

That's why I attempt to do what Jesus told the Apostle Paul to do.    2 Corinthians 5:14  For the love of Christ compels us, because we judge thus: that if One died for all, then all died;  15  and He died for all, that those who live should live no longer for themselves, but for Him who died for them and rose again.      16  Therefore, from now on, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know  Him thus no longer.  17  Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.      18  Now all things are of God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation,  19  that is, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not imputing their trespasses to them, and has committed to us the word of reconciliation.      20  Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were pleading through us: we implore you on Christ's behalf, be reconciled to God.  21  For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Pure speculation, which only tells us about you     -- that you are very harsh  --- that you think most people are evil  --- that you don't accept any higher learning than your own     I go by the Gospels. They say and show that God is loving and merciful and they also show that you can go to Hell. Jesus wept over Jerusalme and wanted to gather them as 'a mother hen gathers her chicks !'. He wept but they were utterly destroyed.     IF I use the evidence at hand I conclude that God loves us and taht we can go to Hell. You take part of the Gospel and reject the rest.

I'm not sure why that's such a difficult concept to understand.    Actually, if you can't understand that, then it's extremely unlikely that you'll understand much of the rest of our conversations.    Okay, I don't believe that people are going to hell, since God is love, and love doesn't hurt others, even if they might deserve it.    But then, you're dealing with literalists, who take everything in the Bible literally. So if the Bible seems to say that the non-believers go to hell, then that's it.    The Bible, for these folks, is holy writ, and there is no discussion, no debate, no negotiation. They would not dispute God's decision, but would submit to it. As one writer suggested, since heaven is a happy place without tears, the memory of those who didn't make it would be presumably wiped out.    Not that I buy that interpretation of scripture.    I can imagine that after the judgment, all the faithful in Heaven would petition that all their friends be released, and brought up to heaven with everyone else. (Good start fro some kind of novel, I suppose)    But again, I don't believe in the fundie version of hell.    I do suspect that hell exists, and we can put ourselves in it. Look at all the agnostics and atheists, and the hell they have put themselves in.     What a wretched, unhappy lot. I rest my case.    Whoa, easy on the thumbs-downs, folks. We don't want to crash the system!

Iconoclasm during this pharaoh's rule is considered a chief origin for the subsequent destruction by some groups of idols, holding that no other god before the preferred deity (dually and subtly acknowledging the existence of the other gods, but only as foes to be destroyed for their drawing of attention away from the primary deity).    Though holding a dualistic or even polytheistic worldview/cosmology, Zoroastrianism is considered by some to be one of the earliest monotheistic religions. Additionally, the Zoroastrian faith includes characteristics different from those found in purely monotheistic worldviews, including worship of subordinate nature-spirits and the use of fire-reverance.[7]|`|X8LNbaKQaa	Oh, Heck no.

Then Christianity took it from them. Then Islam which took the concept from Christianity.    Oh wait, Zoroastrianism may be the first. But I'm not clear on whether that was one God, or two gods; one good, one evil...  to me it seemed more a ying and yang concept... that the dark or evil that was sealed within the world had to be overpowered by good via the people?

A rock in mecca, and the moon?|`|tJa60S4Taa	I believe Zoroastrianism was the first monotheistic religion. (Monotheistic means there is only one God). Zoroastrians believe in a good God and a bad one, more or less, but I think rather than believing the bad counterpart is an actual God, it is similar to the concept of Satan in Christianity. Judaism came after Zoroastrianism, then Sikhism, and Christianity came after that. Then came Islam, and then Baha'i. I have obviously left out many other religions, but I am just stating the major ones. Judaism and Christianity share beliefs with each other, while Zoroastrianism and Sikhism are both unrelated to them and each other (although Zoroastrianism did influence Judaism, and by extension, Christianity as well, to some extent). Also, Hinduism is even older, and some Hindus are monotheistic, some are polytheistic, and some even atheistic, because Hinduism is a very malleable faith. Mahayana Buddhism is also monotheistic, and I think it is older than Islam but younger than Christianity, although I'm not sure.|`|jq85LU0gaa	According  to my class on world religion it was Zorostrianism, however before Judaism and Christianity there was a group of people in the Middle East, in Canaan who worshiped "One God" The tribe of the Prophet Abraham the Father of all three religions Judaism and Christianity and Islam. Prophet  Abraham referred to himself as a Hanif which meant belief in "One God" this is stated in the Holy Q uran Surah Al Baqarah     2:135: And they say: Be Jews or Christians, you will be on the right course. Say: Nay! (we follow) the religion of Ibrahim, the Hanif, and he was not one of the polytheists.     2:136: Say ye: "We believe in Allah, and the revelation given to us, and to Abraham, Isma'il, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and that given to Moses and Jesus, and that given to (all) prophets from their Lord: We make no difference between one and another of them: And we bow to Allah (in Islam)."     The word "Hanif" is found in the  Quran and the Hadith of the Prophet Mohammad, its pronounced in the Arabic language and translated into English. None Arabic speaking  people have never heard of this word "Hanif" and poeple of Judaism and Christianity faith deny it, because they are always trying to disassociate themself from Islam.|`|MMImKRAgaa	Ankenaten was exiled for the belief in one God, yes he was an Egyptian king during the captivity of Israel.|`|AA10405801	Christianity is a poly theistic religion.

Although Vedic Hinduism includes a pantheon of gods, its scriptures repeatly stress that all the gods are so many forms or manifestations of one impersonal omnipresent deity, which is the ground of existence.  Some types of Egyptian religion--such as the Amon cult--were said to be somewhat monotheistic.  Early Greek religion is believed to have been somewhat monotheistic. Kronos (which was the Greek equivalent of the pre-Zorostrian deity Zurvan, who was related to the Indian Shiva/Mahakala, was the supreme deity.)|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	No|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Plato and Aristotle demonstrated this from reason alone, long before, maybe 400-500 BC.

[21] She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins."       Matthew 17:22-23  When they came together in Galilee, he said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men. [23] They will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised to life." And the disciples were filled with grief.       Luke 19:10       For the Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost."       Mark 10:33       "We are going up to Jerusalem," he said, "and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles,       Luke 24:45-47       Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures. [46] He told them, "This is what is written: The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day, [47] and repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.       John 12:30-33       Jesus said, "This voice was for your benefit, not mine. [31] Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be driven out. [32] But I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself." [33] He said this to show the kind of death he was going to die.

Jhn 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.         Jhn 3:17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.         Jhn 3:18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.|`|p6wwiQG3aa	Der  read the gospels again deary.

These people are often children of alcoholics and are in "caretaker" positions, like nurses,teachers etc, not all are or that there is anything wrong with these professions. Some have a greater need to feel needed.

As soon as the new wears off or they get offended by something someone says they are out the door looking for the next "new thing" to fulfill their sad little life.. They have no commitment no dedication to anything because they know as soon as the going gets tough they get going.  They are the ultimate QUITTERS!  Loooosers!    Relligion is man-made and can only provide the meaningless existence of man trying to earn his way to God by being good enough for working hard enough to make it..    Jesus took all that away and gave us the only way to have a personal relationship with God.  If you're interested please follow the simple steps.. http://www.godlovestheworld.com

There are MANY days I wish that I could leave this life and go be with The Lord.  However, since He is The Lord, it isn't up to me to decide.

The apostle Paul expressed desire to go and be with the Lord, as well, but he also realized his life was not his own to do with as he wished.  He lived to serve Christ, and spent a lot of time in prison, being mocked, beaten and accused.|`|EAFtAO57aa	You have to finish the business of your soul,thats why.|`|fb20242b0c0635b69a6d2c2fceab8b4eaa	No that is a very good question, and sometimes I feel like killing myself or asking God to kill me. But I remember that we have only once chance on this Earth to earn our rewards as Christians in Heaven. There is two judgements, the great white throne which seperates belivers from non-believers and sends non-believers to the lake of fire (I'm dead serious!).  And the other is the bema seat of judgement which judges Christians based on what they did with thier lives on Earth. We Christians have a purpose here on Earth. We also experience things from heaven on Earth, such as the comforter (The Holy Spirit), and living a holy life and fellowship with God is worth living for.|`|hjxsX4liaa	Suicide is conveniently a sin  : )    It is almost as if the people who made it up wanted you to believe that there was great reward for living a god life, but then thought, "Oh no, what if people start killing themselves to get there? Hmmm ... We had better make killing yourself a sin."  : )    Peace  : )|`|vDr5aROwaa	Whether suicide is a sin or not is not important. The important thing is that God is the only one who has the right to take your life, not you or anyone else. And besides as a Christian I believe that he needs us to allow him to do his work through us and also to glorify and praise him. Now how can we do this if we go around killing ourselves?|`|dSFZHrLJaa	In the bible, suicide is a sin, resulting in everlasting pain and suffering. I do not know exactly where it says it, but I do know that God created you for the purpose of living, not so that you can take your own life. Only God has the power to end your life when it is time.     Because of Adam and Eve's sins, we are forced to work and suffer through life, earning our spot in heaven next to our Lord and savior for eternity. Now doesn't that sound better than ending the pain that will only last a little while longer, causing pain for the rest of your life with no escape, as opposed to enduring through it now, and living in paradise for the rest of eternity??|`|02bkYq9Yaa	God has a purpose for us here on earth and once we fulfill it, we go to Him. God's purpose for us could be bringing somebody to know Him or help someone through a rough time. We are also here on earth to get to know God. On earth, we spend our time building that relationship and in heaven we enjoy it. I think deciding to take your own life is selfish in a way whether to be with God or because you just can't take it anymore. There is so much to do on Earth and life is more precious than a person can know. I as a Christian believe suicide is a sin(as interpreted in the Bible) but I don't believe in ALL cases God will banish you to hell for it. God is the most intelligent being ever. He knows what he's doing and will decide accordingly.|`|d4bd8b0d4b217939ff505d70042c7c38aa	Suicide is murder of one's self, and ALL forms of murder are sin.   God is the giver and author of life, and it is HIS right and privilege to give it AND TAKE it when HE wills it.  Not our will be done, but HIS will be done.    The Apostle Paul wrestled with this same question.  In Phillipians 1:21-26, he writes:    For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain. But if I am to live on in the flesh, this will mean fruitful labor for me; and I do not know which to choose. But I am hard-pressed from both directions, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, for that is very much better; yet to remain on in the flesh is more necessary for your sake. Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy in the faith, so that your proud confidence in me may abound in Christ Jesus through my coming to you again.    === What he is saying here is, yes, to gain the glories of heaven and being with God would be just great and wonderful... BUT he has to remember that it is NOT God's will for that to happen at that time.  His "job" (purpose) is to serve God, do God's will, and help the other believers in Christ... and he will do this JOYFULLY, because he knows that he is doing God's will.    Hope this helps you... SERIOUSLY.      Have a blessed day.|`|tVoMXFDRaa	We are here to serve God and to spread the word of Christ.

ebe9af0dbeaeb8a4623c52d9fc71c05faa	Because at the moment we are a bunch of post-industrial primitives trying to make our way in a VERY big universe which is - at best indifferent to our existence.     If God created the Universe or just the Solar System or whatever, that's great. I suspect that 500 years from now, we'd be doing pretty good for ourselves to have a self-sustained colony on Mars. Having such a colony practically doubles the chance of survival for our species.     In this way, God may swoop down one day and say - "How am I doing?!" expecting adoration and such, but what if God swoops down onto the pitiful survivors of some post-nuclear Holocaust, or some "12 Monkeys" kind of scenario, someone might be forgiven for suggesting WTF, where were YOU when we needed you.    In this regard, we should pursue knowledge and scientific endeavor because so far there isn't alot of evidence to suggest that God exists, frankly. We could suggest that the Universe all around us stands as testament. Fine - Who's God was that? Was it the God of Abraham, or perhaps the great Lion-Turtle of Vedic tradition. Perhaps the Raven and the Bear were the creators of the heavens?     Perhaps the Zoroastrians were correct, or the Sumerians? Since we can't really know, it's best to keep our minds hearts and eyes open and get to work making sure we don't screw ourselves through some action of stupidity.|`|aIbcPSYiaa	Your assumption is not correct.

Cane Masters International Association       Students, Please click here to log in       The CMIA (Cane Masters International Association) has been established with the cooperation of martial artists worldwide, representing a wide variety of martial arts styles.    "I knew there was a lot of interest in starting a martial arts organization focused on the cane," says Master Shuey. "But I was really blown away by the enthusiasm as we started getting it off the ground."    Shuey says once the word got out that the association was being formed he got plenty of volunteers for the Board of Directors.    The purpose of the organization is to further the growth and popularity of the cane as a martial arts tool which can complement any martial arts style, and to offer people from all walks of life a legal self-defense and exercise system.

Most are just afraid not to,(the whole stupid hellfire doctrine). I guess for the rest like myself, the most obvious reason we believe in a Creator is the visible creation.  For me, design means a designer. For me it is really that simple. I have other reasons as well. Is the reason mentioned good enough for you?  If not, ask again and be more specific as to what kind of reason your looking for.    I guess we just see things differently.  I'm sure we read the same science books and mags. Some of them push creation, some push evolution, big bang, or a hundred other theories. Still, I see design. I'm sure you've heard the old illustration about the house in the desert. You can't expect me to believe that it grew out of the sand.  Their is evidence that someone built it even though I wasn't present to see it built. Likewise, the human brain, heart, the earth, and other planets, laws of time and space, and everything I have ever read or studied about science and history lead me to believe in a creator, designer.    Have to leave work now, I'll visit this question later...Promise    Okay, I'm back to work. I read a few other questions of yours, like 50 or something. Seems that this subject is important to you.  May I ask why?     I've spent almost 15 years of my life teaching others to understand the Bible, science, and history.  I've also spent much time teaching how these 3 can be harmonious.    If you would like to know more, you can email me.  But please, email me only if your reasonable.  I don't like to argue.  My beliefs are not set in stone and I'm not a fan of blind faith. However, when I detect that someone's mindset is stubborn or unreasonable then there is no point in continuing discussion.    My initial email contact is inlovewithoutlove@yahoo.com|`|AA10158935	I believe in God because I have felt a presence in my life that really only could be described in the kind of language we use for God - Holy, ever-present, love itself. I don't have to explain myself, but that is the 'why' for me, and so can say that I do know why.    As to nature being "the only way it could be" - given the necessarily random nature of subatomic physics (quantum mechanics) - well all I can say to that is that such a statement is a far sillier thing to believe in than God, since the statement is completely falsifiable. Every time a photon strikes your eye, you change something in the past.    http://www.metanexus.net/metanexus_onlin...    Due to the uncertainty built into the universe (both in terms of quantum mechanics and the second thermodynamic principle), nature in fact could be anything - the odds against nature being what it turned out to be are.... a rather large number. A larger number than could be managed in a 32 bit byte anyway, unless its a float with a very, very large decimal for an exponent.    As to the Bible being "just a story book" - that betrays a rather poor understanding of what the Bible is. Parts of it are mythological, certainly, although as Tolkien has said, mythology is often truer than history. Some of it is poetry, some of it is prayer.l Some of it is actual history - few doubt that the Bible fairly accurately represents the story of Nebuchadnezzar's conquest of Judaea and raiding the temple, and Babylonian steles confirm that the Babylonian exile of the Jews was quite real. The New Testament gospels likely have some basis in a real story, and Paul's letters aren't stories at all, but read as what they claim to be - instructive letters.|`|AA12310415	Theism is the belief in one or more personal deities. More specifically it may also mean the belief that God/god(s) is immanent in the world, yet transcends it.      Atheism, in its broadest sense, is the absence of theism (the belief in the existence of deities). This encompasses both people who assert that there are no gods, and those who make no claim about whether gods exist or not. Narrower definitions of atheism, however, typically only label people who affirmatively assert the nonexistence of gods as atheists, classifying other nonbelievers as agnostics or simply non-theists.    Many people who self-identify as atheists do tend to share common skeptical concerns regarding the evidence of the world's many deities and creation stories as well as questioning the goodness and morality of religions that have brought us such things as holy wars and inquisitions. Yet while some adhere to philosophies such as materialism, naturalism, and humanism, there is no single ideology that all atheists share, nor does atheism have any institutionalized rituals or behaviors. Indeed, atheism is inspired by many rationales, encompassing personal, scientific, social, philosophical, and historical reasoning.    Although atheism is commonly equated with irreligion in Western culture, some religious beliefs (such as some forms of Buddhism), though not often so identified by the adherents, have been described as atheistic.            there is alot of information at www.wikipedia.com about theists and atheists
rIA2sPeqaa	Why are they? Because no one educates them about it, especially not the churches. They only educate themselves and their children and other followers about the "bad" things of other religious groups.   People wouldn't follow them if they knew the truth about their past, so they "brush it under the rug". That is also why many are so anti-intellectual. They want to keep their followers ignorant so as not to loose them.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	The Christian church NEVER takes up arms to defend herself. GOD takes care of HIS OWN!

Why would you think Americans who claim to be Christian would have any knowledge of anything outside their own country?

A few years ago, the RCC sent out a directive calling for their clergy to stop their people from reading the Bible.  Last year, came a report orfdering the clergy to never use the name "Yahweh" or "Jehovah" in any service and to remove it where it was already existing.  "Yahweh" or "Jehovah" is the true divine personal name of the Most High God, Author of the Bible.|`|g5jvbZGVaa	Because they nitpick what bible sections they want to follow, God advocate the stoning of children... but they don't do that anymore...|`|LqyOHY37aa	I think they know, they are more into denying it.|`|entRyNolaa	do you have something against violence- animals do it, besides, the road to chaos is filled w/good intentions|`|ZyHPOzdWaa	Because a lot of people live in ignorance of a lot of history...not just the history of Christianity.|`|XN0cYCATaa	Christianity is not properly represented by the Inquisition and the Salem Witch Trials. Though these things happened in the name of "Christianity" it does not mean that this is what Christianity teaches. Instead, Christianity professes conversion by love not by torture.  Those who you used coercive means did so against the Christian scriptures.    ?Matt. 5:43-44, "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor, and hate your enemy.' 44 'But I say to you, love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you.'"   ?Rom. 16:19, "For the report of your obedience has reached to all; therefore I am rejoicing over you, but I want you to be wise in what is good, and innocent in what is evil."   ?Col. 4:5-6, "Conduct yourselves with wisdom toward outsiders, making the most of the opportunity. 6 Let your speech always be with grace, seasoned, as it were, with salt, so that you may know how you should respond to each person."   ?1 Tim. 3:7, "And he must have a good reputation with those outside the church, so that he may not fall into reproach and the snare of the devil."   There have been times in the Christian church where those who have claimed to follow Christ have done horrible things. They have done these things not because Christ teaches them to, but because they have not listened to the word of God. As is frequently established in history when anyone comes into complete political and military control that abuse almost always follows. The Inquisition was a Roman Catholic invention intended to root out all sorts of "heresies." The Inquisition used torturous means to force confessions out of people. Thousands were killed mercilessly and unjustly. The Protestant Reformation distances itself from the Catholic Inquisition. However, it has its own sordid history and the witch trials we had here in America among some Puritans is an example.  They allowed their paranoia and ignorance to overtake reason and scripture.  As a result, many people were killed because they were accused of being witches -- and they weren't.    Again, this does not mean that Christianity is false anymore than the police force is false because one or two cops did bad things in the name of the law. Instead of looking at the two cops, the whole of the police force, its goals, other cops, and its history of sacrifice and protection must be examined as well. The same as Christianity. It has a great history of helping countless people, establishing orphanages, building shelters, helping famine ravaged countries, and seeking to aid the downtrodden.    If anyone wishes to condemn Christianity because of the failures of its members, then will they also look at its successes and approve of Christianity? It would only be fair to look at the whole of Christian history and more importantly at what the Bible actually teaches, in particular the New Testament, from which Christianity is derived.    Believe in Christianity because Jesus Christ claimed to be God in flesh, died for our sins, rose from the dead, and has given us the New Testament. Believe in Jesus because He performed miracles in front of eyewitnesses and He said that He was the way the truth in a life (John 14:6). Believe Christianity because of who Jesus is, not because of what some so called Christians did in error.|`|NZ0mRaG3aa	To say Judaism and Christianity "flourished under Islam" is inaccurate. The sharia law meant that mohammedans who wanted to become Jews and christians were threatened with being killed, and one could not try to convert them so they might receive salvation through Christ without encountering threats. They (christians and Jews) also had dhimmi status, which often meant having to pay more taxes and other disadvantages. But it would be better being a christian in a muslim country back in the Middle Ages, than it would be to a muslim in a christian one. But we have progressed a lot, whereas Islam seems stuck with thinking 500+ years old.    The crusades were certainly wrong, but remember that Islam was itself founded on war. Mohammed was personally involved in 23 battles, and chopped off many heads of opponents [compare with Jesus and the apostles to see really righteous, loving behaviour in action]. The early caliphs by war conquered Babylonia(Iraq), Iran, Syria, Judaea, Egypt and North Africa. Later wars of conquest took Islam into Spain, Afghanistan and India.|`|AA10138269	Because some believe what's in the past stays in past and they were Not apart of it.|`|824bce2fad9114b25d7ef595937f7ae4aa	Christianity has conflict in its past?

Follow the Spirit of God, but make sure the path you're following isn't one set by Man.

Here's a cute answer for those that doubt:  "God, we don't need you anymore.  Science has figured out a way to create life out of nothing.  In other word, we can do what you did in 'the beginning'."  "Oh - is that so?" replies God.  "Yes. We can take dirt, form it into the likeness of You and breathe life into it, thus creating 'man'".  "well, that's interesting - show me", says God.  So the scientist bends down and starts to mold the soil.  "Oh no- no, no..."interrupts God.

Those who believe do so based on faith which can't (nor has to be) proven. Those who believe there isn't a God believe so for the same reasons... There is an alternative: Agnosticism. Agnostics believe that there isn't significant proof to believe that there IS a God, but also that we can't prove for sure that there ISN'T a God. Agnostics are not pretentious enough to believe that they have all the answers.

People knew the Earth was round since the beginning just about because they could see how the Earth curved upon the horizon as ships went out across the seas, it wasn't measured until two Greeks (I forget who) used some large lighthouse or something and measured the angle from where they were standing to the top from opposite sides and then estimated the size of the earth as a polygonal shape, they were pretty close too.  The flat Earth thing is from movies and stuff.    Life didn't evolve from simple organisms, show me any lifeforms that have "evolved" during the historical era, none.  Though many have been selected for certain genotypes of genomes by man (breeds of dogs).    The only life form that is even seen as to mutate to an advantage are viruses, which are still debated as to whether they are organisms or not since they require a host cell to produce them but they themselves infect a cell. This is why viruses are one of the key creations that show God or rather God's punishment of sin exists for they could not exist without being put here in the first place to infect someone.|`|27335ce2d7d059dd4567a4184714309eaa	Would the same people who argue against creationism here have argued against a round Earth 500 years ago?

When His children are naughty, He gets angry.  When they're good, He rewards them.|`|3fd76098aa92fe65d86dafdd5208da86aa	Man created god in Man's image. Therefore God will have man's emotions. It is that simple.|`|AA10942708	Yes, bipolar AND dissociative - at the same time!!!|`|bd82b48e6ec8b996ce41d4de29133c91aa	Dude, i respect your point of view and i think you don't really know anything about God, you may know about the main person of an important book. Probably like a movie or reality show, that is why you think in that way... So, don't try to understand him... what makes you think you can... You can not even understand your self and your life, how can you love, if you don't know what love is... I think the question need to be WHAT DO YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND GOD...|`|AA11213162	No you do!|`|AA10485422	I know.One minute he cares about me and my life,the next he has my girlfreind brake up with me.

PmwX2VXOaa	isn't that a shame? I have always considered it to be continued education. I agree with you. I have a pretty good idea though that some folks are more concerned about helping themselves or those around them. I think when others see how bad people in other countries may have it, it depresses them big time. Others I think, can't even take care of themsevles, let alone care about what happens to others elsewhere. It's a shame but it's true. and it isn't just happening in america.|`|5wrtEn2Oaa	Most people don't care about those stuff because they think that their life won't be affected if they knew or not but it does and i hope this helps^^|`|NRvTj9gJaa	Because Americans, in general, are quite spoiled and self-centered.|`|ZSChMrDeaa	"Yeah - I'm a proud American but it does seem like there are a lot more dumbasses here than in other countries."    Oh so you have went to school and visited other countries?  I JUST LOVE how some Americans in America go off the ball to bash this nation. I JUST LOVE how this government ACTUALLY ALLOWS YOU TO DO THAT. There are dumber countries than America when it comes to society, like in Japanese society where you are treated like crap if you are Black. So don't be a bigot and go off on how much America sucks when you have not even been to other nations!        "Like, why do they not want to be informed about the political and social issues over in Europe or South America or Asia?"    BECAUSE we have enough issues OURSELVES. Our economy is messed up right now, our crime rate is rising and jobs are being lost everyday. BUT NOOOOOOOO lets be a mother and sacrifice our own wealth and feed the world, most nations who would turn their back on us anyways. Like it or not, to most Americans America is more important than the World. Most could give less of a care about Europe because WE HAVE OUR OWN ISSUES! Our effects are international so that is why other countries even care to stick their noses in our business (like the elections, most people don't even know what state Obama was a senator from but most bigots in Australia were like "OH MAH GAWD OBAAAAMMAAAA", I even liked Obama more in the election but my god Europeans and Aussies should keep their noses out of our business, they can't vote and they sure won't pay taxes.)    If you liked to be informed about this stuff well WHY NOT look it up on the internet and look it up on latest news on other nations?  We as Americans have our country to care about, if you want to be so "informed" on what goes on in countries that you don't live in and countries whose effects are not felt globally, then go right on ahead but DO NOT stop Americans from caring about their country right now. We need support from our people now more than ever.|`|lHzBJA4eaa	They only do that to Canada.All the other countries live off of Foreign aid from America so it seems they do care. Ask Africa how they feel about George W. Bush. He has contributed so so much to the fight against aids. What is really sad is I'll get thumbs down for saying that .People don't want to hear the truth unless it is THEIR truth.|`|JSryPP8faa	That's not true my friend, it's our earth and we all matter and I care.|`|k9gp11PMaa	I'm a 14 yr old American, and I care. I dnt want humanity destroyed. Thats y when I get older & move out, I'm helping out w/ humanity.|`|jdKTs3aHaa	probably b/c it doesn't effect them. and it's not like i can turn on the tv and hear whats going on in china or something.|`|4xtJjPzyaa	It's not just America. I guess because they have obviously more power and influence that people single them out and fair enough.  But there are people like that everywhere. I live in Australia and everyone here verbally bashes people from America stating that their ignorant but they never realize that their equally as ignorant about whats occurring in the world.   I think that probably the idea is that they don't want to be informed about whats going on because they are too involved in their own personal lives. Also they might feel as if they have no power to change. Or maybe they are just fatalists or don't give a damn.|`|GrKiEDb1aa	We have enough problems in THIS country without getting all het up about other countries.    People send aid to kids in foreign countries but turn a blind eye to those sick and hungry kids in AMERICA.  Kids from overseas get sent to America for surgeries, and American kids DIE because they have no insurance.|`|J3rdyzNsaa	we care its just the influence bush had on his people  under obamas rule, thats gonna change!! where are you from??|`|170c8a77f6030f45fedeed6a6258a433aa	In large self-sufficient countries like US, Brazil, and Australia most common folks are not too much affected by other countries so they are not concerned about them. In smaller countries where commerce is closely connected to neighboring countries, people tend to be concerned about their neighbors and learn their language, as in Europe and Africa. In the US people in border areas are more concerned about their neighbors. I live in New Mexico and about half of the population speaks Spanish and has ties to Mexico so there is more concern and knowledge about Mexico than in, say Missouri.|`|hA5m65Waaa	I just dont care about what happens in countries where they hold rallies yelling things like "Death to America"..    Not being aggressive, just sayin..We'd be looked at as the bullies if we went outside postin up signs like that about other countries, but its acceptable for them without knowing OUR way of life|`|Ku7S64w7aa	What Hydrometal said.    All those European countries are small and neighbor eachother, so of course they're going to be informed on eachother and want to learn eachother's cultures and language. In North America there's only like what, 3 countries: Canada, US and Mexico. And 2 out of those 3 speak the same language with the exception of French-Canada.|`|MyV9qm99aa	Good question. I do not look at the media and say " oh  Russia hates USA" I psychically go there and interview people and see what is happening currently in the country. People think that "oh it doesn't affect my life, they have no honor in a Country. I BET YOU 100 BUCKS THAT 75% OF AMERICANS DON'T KNOW THEIR ANTHEM BY HEART.     GOD BLESS|`|DUOoMBqoaa	I think it's because the media is owned by big corporations that are more interested in marketing than information. The ugly truth of reality is "bad for business" because there are TVs and cigarettes to sell and god forbid people realize the effects our decisions have on the rest of the world. It is really sad I agree, and scary too.|`|udQvs0kZaa	I care about certain aspects of places around the world... Some of it I don't really care about. Like Africa.... "Their children are starving and they all have AIDS!!!" Well.... They wouldn't have starving children OR AIDS if they didn't screw around so much!!! For crying out loud!!! And we feel inclined to GIVE them crap when our economy is failing and they bring it on themselves in the first place! I know it makes me seem like a really mean person.... But it's true. I mean, when natural disasters happen I really feel for the people involved, but if it's their fault.... I have no pity.|`|9gMQAWBNaa	Many countries tend to be insular, Switzerland and Germany and Britain are good examples of that kind of thinking. They tend toward participation in world politics only if it suits them, if there is some sort of reward in influence and power or wealth involved.   I would think that Americans care little about the world around them because they are content where they are, with all that they have. I don't think its because they are not interested, but it affects them little, until it begins to encroach on their way of living.|`|Uwad1Irmaa	because it has zero impact on my life|`|QdVyo8EYaa	Some of us if not most of us care to some degree, but politics own us. what happens in other countries directly correlates with our business.|`|zA34N6Jwaa	Yeah - I'm a proud American but it does seem like there are a lot more dumbasses here than in other countries. I blame hollywood and celebrity culture more than anything.|`|91fcc8b613eebc31050dad00a0ce0943aa	i care about africa i dont really know about everyone else|`|1Zl7cIUMaa	They do, you're just not payiing any attention.    And like i say, The U.S.A. is the most dominating, powerful and the best country in the world.|`|HUSFy3i5aa	Because we are about to enter an economic depression and our economy has been falling for over 30 years.|`|wqFIC8c2aa	Because we come from very biased school systems thet pretty much only teach about american and not whats going on in the rest of the world.|`|1Gj0uKxzaa	Too affluent and too powerful for too long is part of the problem. Since none of our immediate neighbors is a threat, we don't worry about the kind of wars on our soil that others do. Also, our media used to be much better - now it doesn't show anything unpleasant. Of course the Bush administration didn't help but not allowing people to see coffins of American soldiers coming back from Iraq (this is a first) and keeping reporters out of the war zone. In Vietnam, you saw dead people coming back all the time and you saw fighting in the jungles every night on the news. That made it seem real - now its like a video game.
kNKj4uDCaa	Ma'sha Allah. This is one of the reasons I reverted to this faith, it's high emphasis on equality between men and women. The Quran does point out that there are different roles between the sexes (regarding awrah, inheritance, etc) but these things are to be taken with great respect to our Creator. peace and blessings be with you.|`|y9bn5I3taa	you do realize that man received a punishment as well. man is to do the manual labor. and basically be the provider for the family. so man gets smaller pains over his whole life and women get their pain in big bursts.|`|rgxqL8xoaa	Without reading the book you just wrote, irregardless of "fair," the Bible is accurate the Quran is not. The Bible is the work of at least 40 different authors writing in total agreement over the course of 1,600 years.     And since one was written nearly 2,200 years after the other, I wonder which one is plagiarized?    Moses didn't have to copy anyone else, Muhammad obviously did.    Edit: "Quran was not written by man unlike the Bible?" And so just who wrote the Quran? I always thought it was the murdering pedophile you call "the prophet."|`|HIEtvdEKaa	good point ,I love my mum dearly.|`|p3UDlABeaa	this is so amazing! I'm a feminist, so I'll definitely say the Koran is more fair lol|`|IxoBFCpTaa	The Qur'an says that Allaah subhaana wa ta'aala forgave Adam and Huwa. The Bible says no.

AA12343985	Because George (or his advisors) are brilliant and have brainwashed a majority of the American people to believe that they must defend themselves against the war on "terra""!    They have the American people living fear-based lives and have convinced them that their government knows what is best and that they should be left to make all the decisions.  Soon, there will be no individual rights or privacy left for the average American citizen.  (Or any other countries if the Bush administration has their way.)

They also were to "be fruitful" and fill the earth with the population of children.    Jehovah God's purpose for the earth has not changed.

mUK240ykaa	Yep. Been there. They speak an old version of a German dialect, not Dutch. But they call themselves in German "Deutsch" or "Deitsch", hence the confusion.    "The Pennsylvania Dutch (perhaps more strictly "Pennsylvania Germans") are the descendants of German immigrants who came to Pennsylvania prior to 1800. According to Don Yoder, a Pennsylvania German expert and retired University of Pennsylvania professor, the word "Dutch" in this case owes its origin to an archaic meaning where it designated groups that are today considered German and Dutch  prior to the Thirty Years' War, the Netherlands were part of the Holy Roman Empire and the Dutch were generally regarded as one of several German peoples. This is also reflected in the fact that the German endonym "Deutsch", the archaic Dutch endonym "diets(ch)" and the modern Dutch word for "German" "duits" are all cognates. Although Yoder rejects other explanations, other sources, such as Hostetler (1993) give the origin of "Dutch" as a corruption or a "folk-rendering" of the Pennsylvania Dutch's endonym "Deitsch"."    "[The] Pennsylvania Dutch language is ultimately a derivative of Palatinate German."    "Many Pennsylvania Dutch are descendants of refugees from the Palatinate of the German Rhine. For example, most Amish and Mennonite came to the Palatinate and surrounding areas from the German speaking part of Switzerland, where, as Anabaptists, they were persecuted, and so their stay in the Palatinate was of limited duration."    "However, for the majority of the Pennsylvania Dutch, their roots go much further back in the Palatinate. During the War of the Grand Alliance (1689-97), French troops, under King Louis XIV, pillaged the Palatinate, forcing many Germans to flee. The War of the Palatinate (as it was called in Germany), also called the War of Augsburg, began in 1688 as Louis took claim of the Palatinate, and all major cities of Cologne were devastated. By 1697 the war came to a close with the Treaty of Ryswick, and the Palatinate remained free of French control. However, by 1702, the War of the Spanish Succession began, lasting until 1713. French expansionism forced many Palatines to flee as refugees."|`|iLFYj6Qgaa	No, I didn't know that.  En ik wist ook niet dat er Nederlands gesproken werd in Pennsylvania.

Mannheim, Ludwigshafen, Mainz, & Worms. But there really is no difference between the so-called pf?lzisch variations, even pronunciation is virtually the same. Pretty much all my friends from Germany are aware of Pennsylvania Dutch even though they've never been to the States, and I've heard them say that it's more closely related to Plattdeutsch, or Low German. But I can see how some Germans that are not entirely familiar with pf?lzisch, like Northerners and Berliners might mistake it for pf?lzisch, but Germans themselves don't often see the differences in their dialects unless these differences contain very stark contrasts. Really, their dialects are not really dialects. They simply use slightly different pronunciation styles, maybe a different word here and there that another German might have different word for, and their slang phrases and such.

When my daughter, who was educated in Switzerland was at University in the UK, my husband and I took her 'best friend' to England for Christmas. She had a Yugoslavian passport.  We spent Christmas with my husband's family and since he had never mastered German, the young woman could only speak to my daughter and myself. After about 2 days, she found the courage to say something in English. A family member said, 'Oh, so you can speak English.' To which I replied, 'Yes. Now how's your Serbo-Croat?'  Your written English leaves something to be desired. I don't think you'll find 'wanna' in an English dictionary.  I don't hate any language. There are many I don't understand and there are some which sound harsh to the ear, but I don't hate them.  I have problems with the Geordie accent in English, but I don't hate it.

If you want to be genuine with your "thank you", take some time and put some thought into something they can get some use out of (i.e. cookes or dessert).

ebbe742a1d8629f5a2fa4466f3367c64aa	Nothing I could say could give you the comfort you're searching for, and I wish that wasn't the case. I won't pretend that I understand what you're going through, because although I've had my own share of heartache it's nothing like what you're going through.     I was going to be vague in describing my struggles and how God's brought me through, but I decided to come right out and say it: Last year, I came very close to committing suicide. Yes, I was a Christian and had been since I was a little kid, but I felt like I was failing at life and things weren't going to get better.     Looking back, I'm so glad I didn't go through with it. I would have missed out on - literally - the best year of my life.    *** I'm not assuming that YOU are considering suicide, but you mentioned how hopeless you were feeling and it brought back memories of that experience. ***    Please, please don't give up on God. He will work everything out for you at the right time if you continue to hold on to the hope you have and follow His will.

Are you committed to your God and your faith?  Have you called on God in Jesus' Holy name to help you?      It is my experience that God turns up the heat higher and higher and higher when He wants your attention.  I see you say, "I've given up."  "It's hopeless."  "Still looking for customers for my business even without a car."  That's not stuff a Christian says!  You DID say elsewhere that you pray, but to WHO?  Or WHAT?  Is it the God of the Bible or some God that you don't even know or aren't even sure is out there?  If so, that's not faith!  That's just taking a shot in the dark, a little like tossing a coin in a wishing well (just in case) or crossing your fingers or knocking on wood.    I know very few things in life, but I know God is real.  I know that you do NOT suffer in vain!  God has a reason for this, most likely to draw you closer to Him.  Do you have a Bible?  READ IT!  If not, go to one of the Bible sites online and READ IT there!  Pray to God in Jesus' name!  Confess your agony and your doubt!  Confess that by giving up, you're selling short His almighty power to change things.  I recite this prayer for you:    Lord,    It is the last thing that any Christian wants to read is that someone of faith doubts you as much as he doubts himself.  I don't know this person by name or by location.  All I know for sure is that you're there and you know him/her.  I lift this person up to you, Lord.  You have revealed yourself to me on countless occassions, blessing my family and me beyond our wildest dreams.  This is the bountry of your fruit.  We are undeserving, but you provide faithfully anyway!  I pray that you open up your bounty to this person in need, who is suffering financially and spiritually and even mentally.  Their anguish is clear!  The answer is even clearer, Lord.  You are his/her only hope for salvation!  I pray to you that you will turn around this person's fortune immediately Lord.  You alone can turn a hopeless situation into one of true hope and prosperity.  Reach out to this person, Lord.  Reveal yourself to him/her.  Claim him/her as one of your Christian soldiers.  Lead this person to your house and your word.      I pray these things in Jesus' Holy name, Lord.  Amen.    Lord bless!  Don't give up.|`|dJzGVypmaa	Early mistakes lead to a life-time full of them.    Quit relying on a "god."

You know, people there can be mighty generous. :)  Get connected with the right kind of people, you may find a cheap car, or customers, or a ride to work, ect.    You haven't lost the fight. :)    And have you ever read the book of Job? It may make you feel better.|`|KhJwOurLaa	Don't wait for God. Hang in there and go out and get what you need. As long as you don't give up, eventually you'll see a break through.|`|VRl1jENHaa	As always, the Scripture itself is the key.  So first, I'll quote the Scripture you're referring to:    1 Cor. 10:13 No temptation has seized you except what is common to man. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it.    Notice that the last sentence contains a promise:  EVERY TIME God permits you to be tested, He will ALWAYS provide you with a way that you can END THE TEST.  Now consider this:  according to this verse, upon whom does the burden lie to END the test ... is it God or is it YOU?  I believe it's you.  The verse tells you that He's already acted by giving you a way out of the test; in effect, He's "closed a door but opened a window."  If you choose to stay in the room and not climb out of the window, is it God's doing or your own?    So regarding your test, I'd say that you need to FIGURATIVELY climb out the window.  First things' first:  stop thinking of yourself as a victim.  Second:  search for a job on Careerbuilder.com.  Third:  apply for jobs that you haven't applied for before.  Is it possible that you've discounted a certain category of jobs because you think it's not right for you?  Change that way of thinking and apply.  If you have to work two minimum wage jobs, isn't that better than not working at all?    Think about it.  Perhaps what you've REALLY been doing is trying to close the window God left open for you.

AA12006309	I'm genderqueer as well, and live my life in a very gender ambiguous way.      The first obvious thing is to wear less gender specific clothes.  Breast binding will help loads.  My best suggestion for binding is to buy an actual binder.  People will give you suggestions ranging from ace bandages to duct tape, but these methods can be very dangerous, resulting in difficulty breathing, rib fractures, and sternum pain.    I'll place some links below for binder resources.    If you look around the FtM community there are tons of articles and suggestions on how to appear more masculine or male, and some of these can be incorporated into your own gender expression.    Good luck on your diet, and if you need any more specific details, feel free to drop me an email.

Personally, I go with a molecular gas cloud collapsing for the sun, and the resulting protoplanetary disk for the planets.    As for Earth's moon, I think the Giant Impact hypothesis makes a lot of sense.|`|Xcri5qeTaa	Stars, including the sun, formed from gas clouds which compressed under their own gravity until they ignited. There are a good many stars today which are relatively young, coalescing from the gas clouds of supernovas.    Planets formed from clouds of a variety of elements ejected from stars, which create almost all elements in the universe through fission/fusion.    The Earth's moon is a really interesting case because it appears it was once part of the earth. The prevailing theory is that a large body (asteroid) grazed and distorted the Earth enough that the part which became the moon was cast off over many years. The moon's gradual separation established it's rate of rotation so that one side of the moon always faces the Earth.    The separation of moon and Earth can be thought of like taking a ball of silly putty and pulling a small knob so it looks like a figure-eight, then holding the large part and spinning it. The smaller knob will stretch away from the larger, until it entirely separates.|`|hYzfzu9yaa	Natural occurrences. But I'm just an atheist, not a scientist. I really don't care HOW it all happened.

As for the moon earth system there are a few theory's. The strongest one is that early in the history of our solar system a planetesimals roughly the size of mars hit earth. The debris was flung into space and accreted to form the moon.|`|o4UrRbTvaa	Why do you keep asking non religious questions in this section?  Okay fine, here goes......    Planets form during the collapse of a nebula, into a thin disk of gas and dust. This disintegration of the nebula leads to the formation of a protostar at the center, which is surrounded by a rotating protoplanetary disk. Then, the process of sticky collision takes place and dust particles in the space mount-up the mass, to form large bodies.     While the local mass or planetesimals gets stuck to the large body, the gravitational pull of the body attracts more materials, present in the space, to it. The concentration of the bodies becomes denser and denser, until the moment comes when they collapse to form protoplanets. It is believed that once the planet reaches the size of the Earth's satellite i.e. moon, they begin accumulating an extended atmosphere, by means of atmospheric drag, which in turn increases the capture rate of the planetesimals.    Once the protostar grows to reach a particular size, it can light to form a star. It is at this stage that photoevaporation, the solar wind, Poynting-Robertson drag and other effects take place, removing the surviving disk from the inside. Subsequently, the protoplanets orbit the star or collide with each other, to form a large planet. They can also release materials, which would be attracted to the other protoplanets. Protoplanets that have absorbed a lot of mass would readily become a planet, while the rest, which have survived natural collision, would form natural satellites or dwarf planets or small bodies.      The interiors of a planet get heated up by the energetic impacts of the smaller planetesimals. This causes the planet to melt partly. Its insides then get denser in the core and starts varying in their mass. The effect is more prevalent in planets that are smaller in size, as they lose most of their atmospheres because of the accumulation. However, the loss in gases is restored by out gassing from the mantle and also from the successive impact of comets. There are various escape mechanisms through which smaller planets lose atmosphere they had gained.|`|Z4QbQt3Xaa	They think stuff just happens! Surprise!

dCewrtXaaa	Yes, it is widely used in informal American English, together with other expressions originating from Chinese pidgin English, such as look-see, no-go, no-can-do, etc. "Long time no see" was made popular by the Charlie Chan movies of the 1930s. Detective Chan liked to teach Americans some Chinese wisdom by quoting Confucius. Long time no see was his trademark, and became a well known phrase in the real world thanks to the popularity of these movies.|`|t2rUhyANaa	You betcha !|`|mUK240ykaa	" "Long time no see" Is an English expression used when people haven't seen each other in a while. It probably originates from a Chinese expression, hence the non-English syntax. The Simplified Chinese is  ('hao jiu bu jian' or 'ho noi mou gin' in Cantonese) which literally means, "very long-time no see". An alternative, though less convincing, theory is that it comes from Native American Pidgin English, or an imitation of such speech."    "It has been in British usage since the early 1900s, deriving from Far East, specifically Chinese, pidgin, coming to the UK by way of the Merchant Service, reinforced by the Royal Navy."    "The North American use of the phrase probably comes from the same source but has been strongly influenced by two or three very widely distributed popular anecdotes. The 'OED New Supp.' cites the oldest use in literature in 1901 in "31 Years on Plain" by W. F. Drannan. 'When we rode up to him (an American Indian), he said: "Good mornin. Long time no see you".' It is used in Harry C. Witwer's 'Love and Learn,' 1924 (p. 73)."    "There have been Chinese living and working up and down the West Coast of North America since at least the Gold Rush days of mid 19th century, and before, so Chinese-English pidgin would have abounded around the time the expression appeared. The influence of Native American Pidgins on British English is much less likely."|`|AA10948829	Yes.|`|NCRfZRopaa	Yes, though there are other phrases too, such as, "Haven't see you in a while."

I have done apple and berry tarts so its' not completely different. Here's what I'm going to do:    Buy a packet of puff pastry. Let thaw 45 mins, and roll flat. Cut shapes from the sheet - hearts or circles. Poke with a fork to let out steam. Spoon some cherry pie filling into the center of the pastries, and bake at 350 for 25-30 mins. Brush pastry edges with some apricot jam for a nice glaze.|`|1ec68af802a245413f439236df86307daa	you could always just buy either packaged cookie dough or bake a cake from a mix (usually mix cakes are better than homemade!). and if you can't even do those, pick up something at a bakery. he'll appreciate it no matter what you do.|`|7bc597034795bea4dbbecfea92484579aa	Buy a Duncan Hines brownie mix; the directions are easy and it's hard to screw up brownies.

aleWoJufaa	Dark auburn hair is not my favourite hair colour on the opposite sex.    But if you have a good personality and etc., then you can be very attractive.

You've already taken the first step by putting yourself in that situation but now really push yourself. Try reading a book that is in english, to really challenge yourself. When you're walking around town think of the english word for things you see. ALWAYS speak English, so that you can get a better understanding of it. And enroll yourself in a English as a Second Language class. DO NOT be embarrassed to be in a English as a Second Language class because everyone else in the room has the same goal as you. The best thing you can do is to keep trying!    As someone once told me "You only truly know a language once you dream in it"    Good Luck!|`|zH6D0wigaa	Read.

And being unpopular may get you picked on, which may lead to psychological mishaps and unfortunes.   try being yourself and see where that gets you|`|wF2G3Krcaa	I like to be both. I think I'm a cool person, but I'm not one to always be in the spotlight. In highschool, I was popular, but I could care less if I was or wasn't.

It's the stupid society and their judgments|`|tlUihEOvaa	Nope not anymore but before they would have.|`|wqFIC8c2aa	My mom wouldn't care my dad...would flip out.  He is a hypocrite for this because he had a fiance before my mom who was super white,blonde hair blue eyes the works.|`|c3ed7dc313b7c0181d81e54a991e8038aa	well, they haven't said anything about the friends i've made.|`|3cLA6wCWaa	No.    My mom encouraged me since I was 12 to date every race if I could.  And I listened to my mother very well.|`|wkKJpCwRaa	I'm a Black female, but my parents would really have a problem with me dating a white male. I've never heard them make a big deal about hispanics or asians, but they seem to think it's very crazy when they hear of young black females dating white males, especially my mom. They were talking about it today as a matter of fact, I hadn't said anything, but it was something from other people's experiences and they were astounded by the thought of BW/WM relationships. They were truly tripping off of the thought. My daddy was talking about how he would go through the roof if I brought a white guy home. See, I'm opened to interracial dating from Whites, Asians, Hispanics and all others, but my parents place a sort of pressure on me and they seem to intimidate me.|`|myw1GBiKaa	Honestly? Probably. I come from a very old-fashioned, purely caucasian, All-American family. They'd probably disown me if I ever tried gay-dom or bringing home anyone who doesn't look like they could ever be blood-related. That's speaking for my parents, grandparents, aunts/uncles, etc. though- I don't think my siblings, cousins, or friends would care less, being brought up in the 21st century and all.     I wouldn't have a problem with the idea of an inter-racial relationship though. I especially find Indian and Pakistani or Jewish guys hot.|`|cPQ7TBcuaa	Yes, my parents would. They wouldn't let me date black guys when I was younger and they thought bad of girls that did...but most of the black guys around here are dogs anyways. I married a white guy, needless to say.|`|CiCKFa8Qaa	Nope.|`|twSD9zHzaa	no|`|s4aX6bF6aa	I'm a white female and if i were to date outside of my race the only thing my mother would want is to know that i am happy.|`|AA12018110	If they did, then they'd be hypocrites. As long as I loved the person I was marrying they wouldn't mind, even though he occasionally makes jokes not to marry an African, Eastern European, Asian or anybody from a big island in the West Indies, he really wouldn't care what race they were.|`|d7a112ef93eac466722c5b826bddb73caa	yes, my mom just told me that today, my dad doesn't care; he feels its all about the love. but i think that's really disrespectful b/c you cant tell people who they can and cannot marry or date. my mother just makes me wanna oooo, i hate when people tell me what to do with my life then i want to do the opposite!|`|tmFEFBQKaa	I'm not a White guy, but no, my parents would not have a problem with me marrying outside of my race, considering I am the product of an interracial (Italian & Black) relationship.  And many White parents have issues with their kids dating interracially at first, but eventually, they get over it and realize that if their children are happy, the colour of their partner really doesn't matter.  That said, caucasions seem to be more concerned about their DAUGHTERS dating interracially than their sons. I guess it's thanks to stereotypes that ethnic men are no good and use White chicks.|`|wF2G3Krcaa	Nope. My grandfather is white and my grandmother is black. So, if I wasn't allowed to date outside my race, that would be hypocritical.|`|xEmIhOc3aa	i dont care but my dad doesnt want me to date a white guy|`|2yr3li7Gaa	Mine don't. I think they would actually be suprised if I dated someone in my race LOL!
X8LNbaKQaa	Not everybody tries to live.  But those who easily let go of life, and especially those who simply cannot continue life very long do not produce many descendants.  Their genetics are constantly being weeded out of the gene pool.  Lots of life has been discarded.  Evolution that brought your and everyone else's genes through a long past to the present, runs mostly on slightly inaccurate reproduction  and death.  Its very messy and uncaring, but it has worked at producing things that try to continue living.      So were are both blessed with our life and cursed with having to eventually die by this process.    --   Regards,    John Popelish|`|vMFKIc4Jaa	We have to be alive because we are born.   I make friends easily too but I much rather live in the woods by myself and create Art or Music. I had a friend who was suicidal even though I thought he was faking it. I told him to just do it already if he was going to off himself, because honestly what was I going to do 100 miles away? Eventually he took my advice about giving things time to work out. He was depressed because he didn't have a girlfriend in college and I told him he'd find someone nice in the future. He did and they're married.     I think there comes a time where you can't hold your friends up anymore and they have to find their own path, and you yours. It is okay to help people but for myself I do create a line, or I'd be bananas with worry about other people's lives and their choices. I've made mine. We make out of life what we put into it.|`|3734b5f7e7c27b91d0268c00d9e7ed41aa	Because we need you.  LOL  Try what I do.  Find peace.  Once you come to an understanding of things, that ring like the truth, you can have peace for yourself.  I feel for people, but know that I am not responsible, for what they do, and to some extent, what they feel.  I owe no one, and no one owes me.  I think that I understand life, and that how I fit in, is what I am doing.  Until you learn how you fit, and what the extent of your true obligations are, you might feel pressured to take on, other people's emotions, as though you are responsible.  But you are not.    My best advice, if you have found yourself surrounded by people who are very needy, is to break free from these relationships, because they are harmful, both to you, and to those people who are pretending to be so helpless.  We all need to just grow up, and realize, that life, is sometime hard, but sometimes, it is hard, because many of us refuse to take responsibility for ourselves.  When needy people, find an audience, that will give them 'validation', they will grow comfortable in their pathetic state, and thus, never learn to be adults.  To be a true adult, one needs to own their emotional state, and their financial state. (So many of these endless needy whiners, also seem to always have a hand out for money, because they never seem to be able to budget their money)  If you find it hard to break free from the kling-ons, you might actually have to move, and change your phone number.  The needy whiners, need to learn to stand on their own two feet, and if they continue to find a captive audience to the pathetic lack of trying, they will never learn, to become self sufficient, and responsible.  Thus, by helping out the whiner, you become in essence, a co-dependent, to their denial, of the fact, that THEY, need to take charge of their life, and until they do? They will just continue to be needy.    Now? For the hard part.  Your entire question, and the details, reeks of needyness.  Either   A. You are just like the people you are complaining about,   or   B. You have been infected by the 'helpless' souls, you have allowed into your life, to distort, YOUR thinking.    But, really....  Take a look at your question, and your comments,  and tell me....  How are you different, than the people you are here, complaining about?|`|AA10652430	Amen! Preach! Preach!  Ugh, I know, right?  I cannot FIT IN with people to save my life. I'm too different. I've even ran into and met ppl like me, but they went their own separate ways like every d***body else. No DIFFERENCE THERE, though.    Some ppl need me to stay alive(and are not aware) as well.|`|OUbNSXjJaa	Who is putting special effort? Certain things are happening automatic as per natural law.

And you were born and you shouldn't waste being born because then you would be bored and you wouldn't want to be bored because then you wouldn't have fun. and isn't that what life is all about? so thats why we need to live even though you don't HAVE to live, you just do. And I think I just confused you, but it was fun.|`|xlHC8qPqaa	To try to pass the test.|`|e6MaU7nvaa	We are here because it is Gods will that we exist. He wanted us here we are his children, and he created us, and gave his son to us for forgiveness, and to save our sins because he knew we was gone be signers when adam and eve ate that apple we are born in sin, therefore we can not prevent it, so we must prey, and ask for forgiveness, and do better next time because you know right from wrong. and our only ONLY purpose here on earth is to lean, and worship the lord, and work to take care of our family. NOTHING ELSE, But God has given us our on mind to make our on decision in life. To do . Or not to do.    I hope you realize how Precious life is. Everyone have good, and bad days. Just remember it is BILLIONS of people in the World, and it will always be someone that is doing better that you, and someone doing worst than you, but you just do you.

1557043a70f3c306f73767c3e3c4ae23aa	God said Jesus was his Son, right here:    Matthew 3: 16-17    16 Jesus, when he was baptized, went up directly from the water: and behold, the heavens were opened to him. He saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming on him.    17 Behold, a voice out of the heavens said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."|`|AA11796124	Whatever you say, NOT!    Jesus Christ Claims to be God  Matt. 4:7; Luke 4:12 - Jesus tells satan, "you shall not tempt the Lord your God" in reference to Himself.    Matt. 5:21-22; 27-28; 31-32; 33-34; 38-39; 43-44 - Jesus makes Himself equal to God when He declares, "You heard it said...but I say to you.."     Matt. 7:21-22; Luke 6:46 - not everyone who says to Jesus, "Lord, Lord." Jesus calls Himself Lord, which is God.     Matt. 9:2; Mark 2:5; Luke 5:20; 7:48 - Jesus forgives sins. Only God can forgive sins.     Matt. 12:8; Mark 2:28; Luke 6:5 - Jesus says that He is "Lord of the Sabbath." He is the Lord of God's law which means He is God.     Matt. 18:20 - Jesus says where two or three are gathered in His name, there He is in the midst of them.     Matt. 21:3; Luke 19:31,34 - Jesus calls himself "Lord." "The Lord has need of them."     Matt. 26:64; Mark 14:62; Luke 22:70 - Jesus acknowledges that He is the Son of God.     Matt. 28:20 - Jesus said He is with us always, even unto the end of the world. Only God is omnipresent.     Mark 14:36 - Jesus calls God "Abba," Aramaic for daddy, which was an absolutely unprecedented address to God and demonstrates Jesus' unique intimacy with the Father.     Luke 8:39 - Luke reports that Jesus said "tell how much God has done for you." And the man declared how much Jesus did.     Luke 17:18 - Jesus asks why the other nine lepers did not come back to give praise to Him, God, except the Samaritan leper.     Luke 19:38,40 - Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord. If these were silent, the very stones would cry out.     John 5:18 - Jesus claimed to be God. The Jews knew this because Jesus called God His Father and made Himself equal to God. This is why Jesus was crucified.     John 5:21-22 - Jesus gives life and says that all judgment has been given to Him by the Father.     John 5:23 - Jesus equates Himself with the Father, "whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him."     John 6:38 - Jesus says, "For I have come down from heaven."     John 8:12 - Jesus says "I am the light of the world." - 1 John 1:5 - God is light and in him there is no darkness at all.     John 8:19 - Jesus says, "if you knew me, you would know my Father also."     John 8:23 - Jesus says that He is not of this world. Only God is not of this world.     John 8:58 - Jesus says, "Before Abraham was, I AM." Exodus 3:14 - "I AM" means "Yahweh," which means God.     John 10:18 - Jesus says He has the power to lay down His life and take it up again - Gal. 1:1 - God raised Jesus to life.     John 10:30 - Jesus says, "I and the Father are one." They are equal. The Jews even claimed Jesus made Himself equal to God. Jesus' statement in John 14:28, "the Father is greater than I," cannot contradict John 10:30 (the Word of God is never in conflict). Jesus' statement in John 14:28 simply refers to His human messianic role as servant and slave, which He, and not the Father or the Holy Spirit, undertook in the flesh.     John 10:36 - again, Jesus claims that He is "the Son of God."     John 10:38; 14:10 - "the Father is in me and I am in the Father" means the Father and Son are equal.     John 12:45 - Jesus says, "He who sees Me sees Him who sent Me." God the Father is equal to God the Son.     John 13:13 - Jesus says, "You call me Teacher and Lord and you are right for so I AM."     John 14:6 - Jesus says "I am the way, and the truth and the life." Only God is the way, the truth and the life.     John 16:15 - Jesus says, "all things that the Father has are Mine." Jesus has everything God has which makes Him God.     John 16:28 - Jesus says that "He came from the Father and has come into the world."     John 17:5,24 - Jesus' desire is for us to behold His glory which He had before the foundation of the world.     John 20:17 - Jesus distinguishes His relationship to the Father from our relationship by saying "My Father and your Father."     Rev. 1:8 - God says He is the "Alpha and the Omega." In Rev. 22:13, Jesus also says He is the "Alpha and Omega, the First and the Last, the beginning and the end." The only possible conclusion one can reach is that Jesus is equal to the Lord God.     Rev. 1:17 - Jesus says again, "I am the First and the Last." This is in reference to the God prophesied by Isaiah in Isaiah 44:6, 41:4, 48:12.     Rev. 1:18 - Jesus, the First and the Last, also says "I died, and behold, I am alive for evermore." When did God ever die? He only did in the humanity of Jesus Christ our Lord and God.     Rev. 2:8 - Jesus again says, "The words of the First and the Last, who died and came to life." When did God die and come to life? In our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.     Jesus' Miracles Testify that He is God  Matt. 1:23; Mark 1:27,35 - Jesus was conceived in the virginal womb of the Blessed Mother.    Matt. 3:16-17; Mark 1:10-11; John 1:32 - God's Spirit descends upon Jesus and the Father declares Jesus to be His Son.     Matt. 4:23-24; 9:35;15:30; Mark 1:34; 3:10; 6:5; Luke 4:40; 7:10; 13:13; 14:4; John 4:52 - Jesus miraculously cures illness and disease.     Matt. 7:35 - Jesus cures a deaf person with a speech impediment.     Matt. 8:3; Mark 1:41; Luke 5:13; 17:14 - Jesus cures leprosy.     Matt. 9:21-22; Mark 5:27-34; Luke 8:44 - the hem of Jesus' cloak cures the woman with the hemorrhage. See also Matt. 14:36.

In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 He was in the beginning with God. 3 All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made.    And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.    HERE for the Son of God     And the high priest arose and said to Him, Do You answer nothing? What is it these men testify against You? 63 But Jesus kept silent. And the high priest answered and said to Him, I put You under oath by the living God: Tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God!   64 Jesus said to him, It is as you said. Nevertheless, I say to you, hereafter you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.   Matthew 26:62-64|`|AA12225848	Luke 1:35  states, "And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God."  One should be reminded that Jesus referred to Himself as "Son of God" and "Son of man."   The designation "Son of God" refers to the deity of Christ and "Son of man" refers to the humanity of Christ.|`|AA12230903	has it not occurred to anyone that god is everyone's father?  how are we to know when jesus referred to "his father" he wasn't talking as if he were only human and saying that god is really everyone's father.   and everyone is a son and daughter of god.  nowhere in the bible does jesus claim divinity.  we just assume that.  don't all catholics say the "our father" during mass where the "father" is god?  think about that before you assume things in the bible that may have been meant to be interpreted differently.|`|AA11046024	This isn't made clear by Jesus himself, but on one occasion he says, "Why do you call ME good?

Islam is a universal message because God sent every previous prophet to his own people for limited Periods of time except Prophet Muhammad (mercy and peace of God be upon him) who was sent to all people;  Black and white, rich and poor, the ruler and the ruled, Arabs and non-Arabs, the slave and the master.  Islam is for all people from when it was revealed until the Day of   Judgment. Indeed, mention of Prophet Muhammads coming can be found in the books of the Bible in spite of the changes which have taken place in their texts.

He's the King of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. 43He trusts in God. Let God rescue him now if he wants him, for he said, 'I am the Son of God.' " 44In the same way the robbers who were crucified with him also heaped insults on him."    Hope this helps,  Jon                                          ...  I get it. You didn't really want an answer, you wanted to correct anyone who is a Christian.    No offense, but I am not changing my answer. The above scripture is an account of an account of Jesus saying that He was the Son of God. (distributive property) Not only that, but it was testified to by the people who actually put Him on trial to die. This is important because:    1) It CORROBORATES with the historical evidence that supports the facts that:  a) Jesus existed as a man  b) He was crucified, and  c) WHY He was crucified    2) I must say again, these people WEREN'T his friends, but those who were sentencing Him to death.    We as Christians believe in 3 "persons" of God: "Father, Son, Holy Spirit". These are NOT separate "beings" because they all embody the perfect likeness of God. "They" all play a role in God's purpose for us. They are all eternally in agreement and in perfect love (with us and one another).    Imagine it like this: You are 3 personages of yourself: "Speech, Writing, and Action". The only real things different is that God's personages ALWAYS agree, and that He embodies higher personages than we do because He is God.    Plus, if we are sinners, can we save ourselves? Nope. That is why we have the forgiveness of Jesus through eternal sacrifice. It seems to me that most "other" beliefs think you have to "earn" something to be saved. Not in Christianity. You just BELIEVE, Jesus takes care of the rest. Plus, who can save himself?    Peace and blessings,  Jon|`|AA11554521	I think Allah sent Eengle directly to Isah (pubh) which was later modified by the cristians and named Bible.

You must remember from Gods point of view, He is the Father and creator of the universe, without Him we would  not even be here, our lives exist because He created us.  we have free will, which can be complicated to those that dont fully understand, but He wants us to know Him, fullfill His plans, and love Him, just as one would expect  from their children, would you as a Father feel warm and fuzzy when your daugter said I love you daddy, if she was "programmed" to do so. would you tolerate blatant disobiedience, or would she be repremanded? knowing how much you love her, if you saw her throwing her life away, you would come down from heaven in the flesh to "SAVE" her from sin, by shedding your own blood.?  God is Love.  God IS father.  people usually have multiple opportunities to accept Jesus, sometimes over and over again. God knows the enemy does not want that for us, and He knows our hearts. so i believe it is when we blatantly refuse Him, we are walking in line with the opposing force.    its almost hypocritical of an athiest to say on one hand they do not believe in the spiritual, they do not believe in heaven or hell, yet they USE hell to say if there was a God, how could He want hell for His children? they have no business even discussing this option since they dont believe. if they think that it "might" be, or this truth "might" be real, then they need to understand and educate themeselves on why God gave free will, and what it all means. Unfortunatley athiests can only speculate. i believe for some reason they are spiritually blocked. not open or able to believe in anything from a "spiritual" perspective is in my opinion rooted in pride, pride arrogance and self absorption are always the enemies doing.  but no, certain tribes of people in remote areas of the world, children etc. they have to be exempt.   some Christians believe they may even be given the option to choose after passing, if it is then they still refuse to accept, then they will get to know satans plan pretty well at that point, since they might be hanging out with him for eternity.|`|AA10793254	My belief is: Its the amount of a mans wrong doings that send him to hell. If he lives a life believing in Karma (God) as in he does something wrong or right he will cop it 10 fold in return and do unto others as you would like them to do unto you, I think he would be a far better person.    I am against religions and how if you repent your sins and say a few hail marys your forgiven. It gives them a clear conscious to go out and sin again as far as I am concerned. Its like all they get is a slap on the wrist and they are free to go out and commit more immoral acts because they admitted they did something naughty and said a few our fathers/hail marys. Thats bullsh*t!People should be held totally accountable and responsible for their actions.  Thats why the world is going quickly downhill. People have no respect for anyone including themselves and claim no responsibility for anything including their own actions.    And yes if there is a God up there the person at the time of crossing over should be judged and treated accordingly. Sometimes I wish I was God with a big black size 14 Boot and give them all a good kick in the *ss!!!    I think the biggest thing that freaked me out when I was a child was some religious advertisement on television which had a little blonde haired boy, sunlight and a tree and children singing in the background and it was saying God sees all by watching us through the eyes of our parents. I admit I was a shocking child but without sounding bigheaded I must admit Ive grown up to be a very kindhearted, fair, good moral adult out of it all and although I cant stand religions, I have faith. I cannot stand religious fanatics who think they have the right to jam their beliefs down others throats neither. God should strike those ones off the earth, they are like biting fleas on a dogs *ss....irritating!    Doesnt sound nice having a God that punishes but he was loving enough to give us life and it was our choice how we chose to live it.

Being a Christian is one of the hardest things to do, but taking up the cross and following Jesus is the only way to heaven.|`|AA11289514	No!    God is love. It is apostasy in christendom that preaches that God would torture disobedient souls forever in a hot place called hell.  God is misrepresented by the Churches thus turn people away from knowing God.    God only says he will destroy the wicked - as in dead, no more, gone. Not keep them in existance in an abyss of horror.    Hell is were all the dead go. The grave where they are conscious of nothing.    [Extract from the Watchtower]  But does not hell appear in the Hebrew Scriptures? Yes. So let us do the logical thing and pry into the background of that word hell. Websters unabridged dictionary tells us that hell corresponds to the Hebrew Sheol and the Greek Hades. It also says that hell comes from the English word helan, meaning to conceal. So we have found that the early meaning of the word hell carried no thought of any kind of heat. It merely meant concealed. We have found, too, that the original Hebrew word, usually translated hell in English Bibles, is Sheol. Now what does Sheol mean? It simply means a hollow place. So the original Hebrew word perfectly corresponds with the original or early meaning of the English word hell.    Now that the clergy have put fire into the word hell, the vital question is, Did the inspired Hebrew Bible writers say that conscious life and red-hot activity exist in Sheol or hell? No, quite the opposite! Instead of blazing fire it is described as a land of darkness. (Job 10:21) Instead of a place of soul-chilling shrieks it is described as a place of silence. (Ps. 115:17) The Catholic Douay Bible, at Ecclesiastes 9:5, 10, says: The living know that they shall die, but the dead know nothing more. Neither have they a reward any more: for the memory of them is forgotten. Whatsoever thy hand is able to do, do it earnestly: for neither work, nor reason, nor wisdom, nor knowledge, shall be in hell [Sheol, AS], whither thou art hastening. So, since the dead know nothing more, or as the King James Version says, the dead know not any thing, it would be impossible for them to know conscious torment. And since there is no work in hell, how can there be activity, red-hot or otherwise?|`|4c6af5ca2e393f371c8982760bd6c298aa	Unless you know God, to say nothing of believing in him, then this question is rhetorical.  When people who answer by saying that He is too good to send people to hell, it more or less comes from the fact that they won't change the way they live to understand why God WILL send people to hell.  He doesn't send us, we send us by choosing to either take His Son as our savior, or not.      God is real, but a truly just God would not be God, if he didn't punish sin.  If we followed the too good example that people like to use, then lets not punish murderers for killing our loved ones, because if we are like God, we need to let them go.    Because God is good, is why sin must be punished, not the opposite.  Just pray and ask him!  It is that simple.|`|53f1237bdd6cd9b10854256be0959b8eaa	Hell is a concept of man designed to keep people in line. It was not a biblical place but a assumed place when Lucifer was cast out of heaven. It was assumed by men that if he wasn't in heaven he must be hell and let's add fire and brimstone. I too do not believe that a God who allowed a man to die as his Son to show people that death was not to be feared and that there was life after death, would than send His people to such eternity. And to all the right wing Christians out there you WILL get to heaven even if you do not acknowledge Jesus as your personal Savior!!! As Jesus said " My Fathers' house has many mansions" and I don't think He meant that some people get bigger houses.|`|AA10058326	Law imputing sin and death, and for the hell of it, is sadly what many carnal, deceived, bewitched christians still do; Not knowing it makes sinners all, witch brings death upon all, followed by hell for all. For what follows Death of a loved one is grief, which many a spouse or parent would aptly describe as hell.    It's "allegory" in both "covenants": Galatians 4, also "mystery" (noted over 20 times) to solve in time, lest all perish by the using of ordinances rather than none perish by grace void of law, which is mercy void of sacrifice, and peace void of division.    Point being law is the root source of sin: Romans 5:13, and also the strength(strong man) of sin's death sting: 1Cor 15:56. So if we all are one flush our law, then there is no sin imputed (where no law, there no transgression), nor any death "sting" to anyone, nor any hell for anyone. For law is the unnamed horse Death rode in on, as in Revelation 6:8, which is followed by hell; And law is the unnamed king of Nineveh in the great fish story of Jonah, who notably disrobed, stepped down, and sat in the ashes when the people believed God(Grace), and the (law)prophecies failed, as noted in 1Cor 13: "whether (law)prophecies, they shall fail".    I find the scrutiny of Athiests to be more welcome than the mutiny of many Christ-ians who know not "Christ" is "the end of the law": Romans 10:4, thereby the end of sin and death followed by hell. I would that there be more scrutiny and less mutiny in the body of "Christ", wherein the head of the body authored eternal salvation, which is notably "through Jesus->Christ", just as peace with God is notably "through Jesus->Christ". And in the Christ thereof there is no sin, which is to say no law, and hence no sin and death, nor any hell following.    To wit: "that God"(the God of all grace) was in "Christ"(the end of the law) reconciling the world unto himself(all light and no darkness at all), and notably did NOT law impute sin to them.    Not to mention receiving the promise (eternal life) comes after doing the will of God, and the will of God which is the same in both OT and NT (Ps 40:6; Ps 51:16; Hos 6:6; Mt 9:13; Mt 12:7; Heb 10:all) is: "I will have mercy, and not sacrifice", and the "not" part is not then, not now, not ever; For God never desired nor ever took pleasure in sacrifice for sin, which is by the law and of the law.     So, perhaps the whole issue of sacrifice(slaughter) in christian theology should be raised to the level of conscience, especially the conscience not purged of sin, which is to say not purged of law which imputes sin, and expelled as being antichrist, and anti-will of God.     The "grace" of our Lord Jesus Christ with you all. Amen.|`|AA12136935	It's not God that sends us anywhere.It's our free will of choosing how we wanna be in this life time.And I think heaven and hell can be encountered in this world too, before the next.It all depends on the choices we make.|`|79e13482caab14955a21641e5725bddbaa	Very true. i have wondered that very often myself.

If you want the freedom of having personal choice, you have to understand that with that comes consequence. God made that very clear.

SO with that logic you have to assume that (while VERY few people are left who have not heard of Christ) God is understanding that there will be some who have never heard....and as long as they can aknowledge that there is a higher power even without ever being told, that accounts for something in God's eyes.|`|AA11601527	There is another problem with Hell.

I too question if you are not aware of Jesus, how is it fare that you are not able to go to heaven.  But, that through the ages, is our job as Christians, to let non believers know about God and his will upon his children.  God gives us free will.  We have the ability to choose whether or not to believe.  We also have the ability to ask for forgiveness of our sins.  Everyone, no matter what their sin, can ask for forgiveness and therefore go to sit by God at his side.  The bible is the key, it is clear as to how to get to heaven.  The more I read it the more I realize that those who don't believe, don't read it.  They are afraid to find out the truth.  I for one, was heavy into drugs and drinking and thought I could not fully give myself to him until I kicked my habits.  It was only when I gave my life to him that I was able to kick my habits.  Now I am in full control of my life.  We could talk for months about it but I have one thing I like to say on the subject to break it down.  If I'm right, I'm going to the kingdom of God, if I'm wrong, I'm still living my life with a strong set of morals and values and I'm happy.  And in the end, if there is nothing but blackness, what did I loose.  But ultimately, I choose to believe.  It's all about faith.  One more thing, when you sit in a chair, you never ever stop to think whether or not the chair is going to hold your weight.  That is blind faith and how many chairs have you fallen out of?  And Christianity is not blind.  2006 years plus of people having faith is not blind.  Have faith, it is good for your soul.  I don't believe billions of people can all be that gullible.|`|AA11399314	Would love be worth anything if it wasn't chosen?   God gave us the freedom of choice, to choose bad or good. Good isn't worth anything if you didn't choose to do it, so we are given the choice. Think about it, if we could only do what was good, no matter what, we would be like walking mannequins. You cannot be pleased with a mannequin for not stealing your wallet, murdering you, or for not cheating on its wife. It is not possible for a mannequin to do those bad things. However, you also cannot be pleased they did something nice for you, since they only did it because they had to. They had no choice, and deserve the same thanks, devotion and love that you give the toaster for browning your bread.    But, if a lustful man is given the chance of a lifetime to cheat with a perfect 10, but puts chooses to deny and kill his own desires to save his loved ones and his God from pain, then he has done something so incredible, it makes the Grand Canyon look like a rocky hole in the ground by comparison.    Mannequins aren't heroes for not cheating, but a person can be. That is why we can have more value than a mannequin.    God gave us choice to give us value. To make us worth the effort. We are incredible beings, but without free will, we may as well be descended from apes.    A bee isn't bad when it stings. That is just what bees do as a reaction; they didn't weigh the options and choose it.     Without choice we cannot be bad, but we would also be incapable of real love. Without choice, our love would be of no value. A blow up doll will do whatever you make it do, but it cannot love you. Without choice, we are little more than a really fancy blow up dolls. We could go through the motions, but would never love.    So, without the freedom to choose, we could not be bad, but we could not be good either. Hate wouldn't exist, but we wouldn't have love either.     Humans have used their power for choice to steal billions and kill millions, to destroy cultures, and to break families. Since humans have explored the freedom to explore right and wrong, the have explored into the depths of evil, and some have soared towards good, but it is up to each of us individually to decide which way we will journey.    In conclusion, God does allow the possibility of evil, but we choose to make or allow it to happen. He can stop it, and at some point he will, but that will come when we die, or Christ returns. We will have showed God our choices. Good or evil. Upon death, we are suddenly locked out of choice and into our fate.    If you tried to go it alone, or turned your back on salvation because you judged that God and his plans weren't good enough for you, he won't force you into Heaven.    If you get to Heaven, it will be because you went to Christ in life and said, I love you, and I want to choose you, and love, and that choice will mean something, and have supreme value. Then in Heaven you will be pleasantly locked into that choice. Free from the call of evil.    As for a loving God sending people to an eternal Hell. I think this is misunderstood. We hear Christ say he who believes in Me will never die and have eternal life, I think he means that.    Some say burned forever in the lake of fire is to sit and burn eternally.    I think Burned forever in the lake of fire means that we will be burned and that we are burned for good. Meaning we are burned up and the result is eternal. Christ talkes about the branches that do not bear fruit will be burned up.     I think "enternal" is not the duration of the punishment, I think the result of the punishment is "eternal". Meaning there is never any coming back from it.     Some get eternal life, and some get burned and are gone eternally.     A loving and merciful God gives you eternal life, others are put to death.|`|AA10945138	This question, and similar others are results of Christendom's tying to mix pagan teachings with real Christianity. God is truly love and won't torture people forever. He gave us free will. We can choose life or death--just like our first parents, Adam and Eve. Adam and Eve were not sent to a burning hell. They simply died and went back to dust.    Here are the true Biblical teachings about death and hell.    1. Our choices are limited to 2: life or death, not eternal torture. ( Deut 30:19)  2. No feeling, no consciousness for dead ones ( Eccl 9:5,10; Isaiah 38:18 )  3. Biblical hell has 2 meanings: (a) as common grave for mankind  according to Job 14:13; Revelations 20:13; (b) as eternal death or destruction, but not torture. Even death and hades will be eternally destroyed according to Revelations 20:14.    Reputable encyclopedias, even Catholic Encyclopedia, has confirmed these facts.    Sadly, religious leaders have obscured God's love and justice by their pagan teachings.    God is also just. So, he will not allow evil ones to exist forever. These ones are to experience second death--or eternal destruction (but not torture). 1Thessalonians 1:8,9; Revelations  20:8.|`|AA10953250	God is fair and just, as hell is a punishment for sin. But God is so loving that he provided a way out of hell, which is the punishment all mankind deserve, by sending Jesus to pay for our sins and be punished in our place.    Because God loves us, he does not force us to accept Him, but gently wooing our hearts to him. And he respects our decisions. Don't you know that God's heart grieves when people reject Him, because He already knows their eternal destiny, which He does not desire? Don't you know God cries for those in hell who have regretted over their decisions to reject Him?|`|bc23763751978b1584788f3f3f53a6f7aa	True love is not permissive.The first false assumption is that love allows the object of that love to do whatever he or she wants. However, this permissive kind of "love" isn't really love at all. Any of you who are parents will recognize that allowing your children to do whatever they want to do is not loving at all. If you were to do this, your children would grow up to be spoiled selfish brats, incapable of loving other people. Permissive gods, who are caught up in their own intrigues, and so allow humans to do whatever they want without repercussions, are found in the pagan religions. However, the God of the Bible wants us to love Him and other people above everything else .

AA12308496	Many questions that we have about why things happen are ask from a human standpoint that judges things with a human eye and not a Spiritual one.  Our understandings are so very limited and biased whereas God's understanding is complete and perfect.  What seems an injustice to us could very well, in one moment of time, many years in the future, work to achieve a purpose of God's that has eternal and marvelous consequences.  To human understanding the death of a child is tragic because a life is cut so short of what we understand as a successful lifespan but in the context of eternity 1 day or a hundred years is essentially the same amount of time to God and to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord.  Sometimes there is not just answer or human reasonable answer but we cannot see God's purpose through human eyes and should and must at times just rely upon faith.|`|338bfdec602da3d0e810e79c55f5a351aa	To begin with, God is Sovereign, He is the Lord of both earthly and spiritual dominions. He wills and creates whatever in them and however He pleases: Blessed be He to whom all sovereignty belongs; He has power over all things (al-Mulk, 67.1). No one has any part in His Sovereignty, nor can anyone intervene in what He creates except as He wills and to the extent that He wills.    It is God who bestows our human nature upon us. We have given nothing to God but He has given us everything without our deserving it.    God may deprive an individual of something he or she values, but grant that individual a manifold return for that loss in the Hereafter. By means of that loss, God makes you feel your need, your powerlessness, your poverty in relation to Him. In this way, He makes you turn to Him with a weightier sincerity, a fuller heart, and so makes you worthier of His Blessing and Favour.|`|ebb799b8a46b93851b6b61536fb463e2aa	God gives us free will, that includes our parents and grand parents.... if we were all perfect...the world would be boring.

09b2deaf36206664a2ebbe7f912a1177aa	to be brief, it was the cowardly british and basically the entire west, which wanted to weaken our competing strength, that partitioned our india.  it seems that over time our Bharat will take what land is hers and thus prove the superiority of indians over our enemies.  it seems that if the partition had not taken place, the brits and their friends would come up with another scheme to bar our Bharat, but in time we would prevail.  jaihind!  the hero strikes again!|`|AA10457208	Well well, for your knowledge Pakistan was not divided by British rather by Nehru and Jinnah.    Now what would have happened if the partition did not take palce??  Ans: We could had 200 crores of people living in India.  => We could had used in much better way the resources Pakistan have.  => We would have bigger industries setup what Banga  => we would not have lost time and energy in fighting each other.  => Muslims would have in better command over India becoz all the wealthy Muslims escaped to Pakistan.  => Pakistan have talented artists and never got infrastructure to grow up. We would have better artists.  => We would had enjoyed the Lahori Biryani as well and Pakistani would have enjoying the Bhopali Biryani.  => Our soldiers would not had got chance to get experince of gurrilla wars and would not have one of the best in world.  => London could had peaceful from all the trrifying Pakistanis.  => The Indian BHAIs couldnot get chance to grow and escape to Pakistan.    To your last question... I would like to say that we are not divided permanently. I am 100% sure that one day people from these three countries realize that dividing on relegion basis was not a good idea and they will mearge together to prove the power of UNITY.

AA12121778	Florence Kelley (September 12, 1859 - February 17, 1932) was a reformer from Philadelphia who worked for numerous political and social reforms. She was influenced by radical writers such as Marx and Engels, and translated some of their works to English. These writers inspired her to work with the poor, and she went to Hull House to help out in 1892. The next year, Kelley was appointed to serve as Illinois' first factory inspector. In 1899, she created the National Consumers League (NCL), which encouraged consumers to buy products only from companies that met the NCLs standards of minimum wage and working conditions. Kelley led campaigns that reshaped the conditions under which goods were produced in the United States. Among her accomplishments were the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 and laws regulating hours and establishing minimum wages. She was a member of the Intercollegiate Socialist Society, an activist for woman suffrage and African-American civil rights. In 1909 Kelley helped create the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and thereafter became a friend and ally of W.E.B. DuBois.

We see in the Bible people who question God- but they trust Him and they ask Him to answer their doubts.      in terms of your last part of the question regarding someone who is doubting their walk- it has to be situation specific.      There are times when we doubt and we need a wise word of encouragement.  We see many Scriptures where Jesus knows that people will doubt and he encourages them not to lose heart.  Jesus wouldn't tell us don't lose heart if he didn't understand that sometimes we do.    i hope that helps... the important thing is not to allow doubt to cause you to draw conclusions that are often untrue.

The term "doubt" usually is another word for "fear".  That is, doubt is an emotion, and you cannot always control what you feel.    The term "unbelief" refers to a deliberate lack of belief, and it is an act of the will.

The term we're using is _" Once you've decided what term you will use to describe your mixed-race family, then you can start on your brother. <br>  There is no excuse for skulking around blaming well-meaning friends for choosing the wrong term: why didn't you tell them the appropriate term?|`|TMi1GhSHaa	does she not know your daughters name? why would she reffer to your daughter as "mulatto" instead of using her name.. and yes that does sound offensive.. tell her to reffer to your daughter as the name she was given.. whatever that may be .. dont bother with the speech on mulatto etc.. some mixed race people have no problem being reffered to as that.. but i do know that gernarlly speaking you, you reffer to someone based on there "race" instead of there name IS rude.|`|a72cc9094600797a6084b6d93880dde6aa	When it comes to someone saying or doing something where your child is concerned, why worry about being nice?  Just tell her you don't like the term and ask her not to use the term within your earshot.  And also tell her that mulatto means a person with one white parent and one black parent.  Mulatto is not a blanket term for all mixed race people.  |`|LQQAQDkIaa	Tell her that term is so 19th century when describing people, These days we say biracial.|`|ed707e35226db79b8859228756c81ab2aa	'mixed' or 'biracial' is a bit more PC. |`|6iCOMx8laa	Just say " I don't know if you realize that this bothers me, but......." She may not have a clue.,,,|`|jGxLBJE4aa	If this is a real friend then just say " I would appreciated if you didn't refer to my daughter as mulatto. I know you don't mean any harm but the word just has bad connotation. I would be more comfortable if you would just call her ______ "(mixed, or whatever word you prefer). This friend is 36 years old, so if they get offended that's pretty childish and its probably someone you shouldn't be dealing with in the first place. Hope this was helpful!|`|b21a12db6c7101e0c78bc6c0259a5e32aa	She probably has no idea that it offends you.  Bring it up in a nice way when you are both in a good mood.  She'll probably feel really embarrassed and apologize (if she's truly a friend), and you could just let the whole faux pas slide.  Perhaps suggest an alternative term that she could use in the future.

Iranian muslims ask for their rights in the west but in their own country there are no rights for people who believe in other religions or political aliences.  People who are not muslims are persecuted and killed, no jobs, no universities or schools for children and youth etc.  YOU HAVE TO BE A MUSLIM.  But in the west, they become civilized and ask for human rights and the right to wear their ugly chador etc.  It is hipocresy and double standart and they think they can fool the world.  Hopefully your question, their stupidity  and other efforts made by the media etc. will show the world who they really are.  Thanks for your question.
N42St5pdaa	Thank you for serving in the Marine Corp.   God bless.<br>   <br>  Some people do have more money than brains. They are not limited to this country, and most that are here have come here from some other country.   |`|234e97b394a4df734de2011bac1d758caa	I, too, think that Americans are too rich. Compared to most Americans, I barely have any money, but compared to many third world countries, I make A LOT of money. In most third world countries, people only make a couple hundred dollars per year, each. In Ethiopia for instance, they only make $120 a year each, which means they make less than 50 cents per day! So hiring people to come to our house to remove ghosts just because of a superstition does prove that we have too much money. I believe in ghosts myself, 100%, but if I think something is haunting the house I try to take care of the problem myself. <br>  <br>  But I guess people should be able to chose how to spend their money. It's just sad when you compare us to people who make less than $1 a day and still never fail to share everything they have.|`|WU22KTTGaa	since you have been abroad, you have seen true poverty.

But some of us are just so blessed.|`|SFjdd6WLaa	I hate to break it to you, but you sound like the atheists who claim God is nothing more than a superstition.  Tales of ghosts have been around way before America.  In fact, there's scriptures in the Bible that describe people seeing and interacting with spirits of the dead: 1 Samuel 28:7-19,  Matthew 17:1-8, and Luke 16:19-31.  However, the Bible says that a person's spirit may not communicate with the living without permission.  The purpose would be to warn the living.  However, demons don't need permission, and they seem to manifest in hauntings.  I don't know if ghosts are real, but my faith says they must be.  I don't know about buying ghost detectors though.  It does seem like a waste of money, when all you have to do is pray.<br>    |`|3RYqo9dJaa	i like how in the religious items they're only christian items. :p not any other religion.|`|FsByX9xxaa	put it this way, I know I am not too darn rich.<br>  |`|xqn0U0H6aa	some are but some of us are just plain too poor.
OqcTPhiSaa	This is a seriously difficult question for us Christians to be honest!<br>  <br>  I believe the most important thing that happens because of the "Jesus in your heart" thing is that you become changed from the inside out. You begin to think and act differently and you begin to love and understand yourself, God, and other people...<br>  <br>  Of course you've certainly met LOTS of "Christians" who aren't loving. Maybe they've been judgemental, shallow, rude, biased, you name it.<br>  <br>  But I believe Jesus spoke "against" people who claimed to *know God* and continued to act that way. It showed that they really didn't understand God at all...<br>  <br>  The loudest voice in western Christianity today is that of the Fundamentalists. Most of them, I think, would say that people always definately go to hell if they aren't "saved."<br>  <br>  But the mainline Christians don't think that way. Neither do the Eastern Orthodox. And I don't believe Roman Catholics are quite as closed on the issue either. It's just to say there are different stripes of Christians with different interpretations. But if you're living in the US or Canada you've likely been exposed to the loud booming voices of the fundamentalists...<br>  <br>  We don't know who obtains salvation and who doesn't. The bible has contradictory scriptures regarding this issue.<br>  <br>  Sometimes it says repent, believe, and be baptized - all those who call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.<br>  <br>  Other times Jesus talks about those who "called him Lord" but did not do the will of His father.<br>  <br>  The verse that sticks out most in my mind is the one about the wedding feast of the lamb: (see Matt. 22: 2-24)<br>  <br>  He talks about all those that had been "invited" but when the time came they were busy and preoccupied with their lives. So He invites the poor, lame and blind. STILL there is room at the banquet, so He goes out and grabs literally those who are hanging around on the outskirts of the premises! <br>  <br>  Among them he finds someone who's robes are soiled, and that's the person He tosses out...<br>  <br>  Doesn't this osund like a picture of God including those who were not necessarily Christians?<br>  <br>  It's good to remember that the bible itself also seems to point to evidence that there will be a judgement and that each one of us will have to stand before God and give an account...<br>  <br>  This is interpreted in different ways by different Christians, but I truly believe that God is just and fair, merciful and gracious. I know that Christ and salvation is the way, but I also know that God hates rebellion against himself and that people die because of their sin and their wanting to be separated from God so that they can live in sin. This doesn't seem to be the case for the holocaust victims and many, many others...<br>  <br>  This is why I tread lightly when I say that, no, I don't believe their destiny is hell. I believe they all have to face judgement just like the rest of us, and that God will examine their hearts. God alone will judge between us, and God is loving.|`|e0127b4e004c1977c834db9ed5e7b10caa	That's what He said. He can't save you if you won't let Him. He can't pay for your sins if you won't let Him and just keep trying to do it yourself. He won't know you when you stand before Him if you didn't get to know Him while you were alive. If that doesn't make sense, I don't know what does. And no one can claim to know the heart of six million Jews.|`|gqhoCu3faa	For The most important facts of your question, please visit the web side <a href="http://www.mormon.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.mormon.org</a> <br>  & <br>  THE SECRET FROM EXPERT <br>  There have to be a purpose for life otherwise we will miss the peaceful path of happiness to choose what is right & wrong.<br>  So,<br>  Spiritually, what is God? <br>  What’s makes God as god?  What is God’s Power? <br>  Well, just try to know, what’s makes God as god, the Power, isn’t it? So what the power can do? Ah? Well, it can give the ability to organise all things & it can give the ability to separate everything and most importantly, the Ability to control everything, isn’t it? Isn’t it good? Ah? So, from my hard study & research effort with the help from god, I realized that the ability to control everything, the Power of God is gradually increased in the full amount to use so; The Power of God is always the omnipotent & existed among everything. & The God now is always the same omnipotent for us, who is organised us & we are growing towards perfection. The perfection is the final stage, not the end. & The Power of God, the Ability is the reward for us to control everything in a proper manner, like the true God of goodness. & Everlasting Happiness is the final stage. & it cannot come alone without the final stage perfection of God. & if god always perfect in perfection then there have to be beginning with God for the organizing progress of all things. So, there is No end and also No beginning for all things, including this on going organizing progress. So, we cannot get anything from nothing. <br>  <br>  If you don’t still agree, <br>  Note  this:  you can use any thing for Good or Bad so, whenever possible If you ask the god for the good reason to give you the ability perfection, because of your obedience, then the God will give you, if the god is good & Almighty. <br>   <br>  If you are humble, Please, Pray to know the truth from true God by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit with great faith. Good or bad, Good with bad, we choose both for our life purpose so values are most important, God gave us the rights to do what is right for you & sometimes, things can be right in your point of view but wrong in Public point of view so Basically, we can do anything for right reason but just pray about it for the Good Answer and try to do the God's will first always.<br>  <br>  Just think, why so much trouble & pain in this world? Then there is only one reason, without pain, no pleasure. So without them, we cannot enjoy this life so always we need them. You use pain & pleasure instead of pain & pleasure use you. I mean the vision of your future should be clear & it have to pull you rather than you have to push so you must be certain to win in order to succeed in your Best job. Keep the photo of your vision, feel it strong enough in your visualizing mind & your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure.  & Love is the Ability. We all make mistakes so it is hard to look for star in daylight. So just in faith, it is possible. Like that the faith in true God. &  If you think, even expert can be wrong then you have to make the fine research in all most everything so It is hard & some time, it is impossible to achieve so Why we need inappropriate action to find the owner of higher power? So, because of Lack of faith in true God, we do not have the great gift of understanding of things. & All things are spiritually first, to govern by God with glory so closely, Have a look at this world of wonders of yours and then you know the truth, when you listen to your real voice and then Having a strong desire to do the best every day then stick with the best to do your best. & most importantly, try to be grateful for what you have now to get out of fear & then, doing your best & making good people, this is going to make your life winning. <br>  <br>  The Law of mercy cannot rob the Law of justice so Justice demands the punishment of our sin but The Law of mercy requires the forgiveness to give to us & God is perfect in perfection so cannot violate his laws so The God provided the way to our salvation to overcome our sin so Jesus Christ sacrifice is much needed to return to live with God, so Jesus Christ is our savior. <br>  <br>  Did you make the commitment to find joy in every moment by using your empowering meanings & conscious focus for the needs of your five senses?<br>  Did you make this promise; I will never going to settle less than I can be?<br>  Do you have the must realistic measurable rules, goals & best clear image of what you really want in all aspects of your life?<br>  Breaking down your vision into mini-goals & give must time for them regularly.<br>  Write it down the answers to be more real & <br>  Try to know all the basics to manage your life & Ask: Is it enjoyable?

Born of the Spirit, because without the Holy Spirit dwelling in you how can your sins be taken away and how can you know the Word of God.<br>  <br>  John 3:16<br>  "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believes on Him shall not perish but have everlasting life."<br>  <br>  If you do not believe that Jesus Christ is Who He said He is, then Salvation cannot come to you.  Jesus is the Savior of the world.  <br>  John the Baptist said, "Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world."<br>  <br>  God is no respecter of persons as Peter mentions in Acts 10:34 and God has set the law that "without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sins."  The only possible blood that could be shed for all mankind was the blood of Jesus the Christ, the only sinless person in human flesh.  Animal blood covered sins, but did not take them away.<br>  Jesus was the final sacrifice that takes away the sins of the world because by receiving Jesus you receive the gift of the Holy Spirit who purifies and refines you.  The Holy Spirit convicts of sins and gets you ready to stand before he Son of Man, Jesus the Christ our Lord and Savior and God.<br>  <br>  In Acts when Peter had difficulty understanding that the Holy Spirit came upon the Gentiles as it came upon him and God spoke to Peter concerning the beasts to eat and said, "What God has cleansed, that call not thou common."<br>  <br>  Verse 17 says "Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, when was I, that I could withstand God:"  In other words Peter believed on Jesus and when the Gentiles believed on Jesus and received the Holy Spirit as Christ had given him, then Peter had to accept the Gentiles as brothers and sisters in Christ Jesus.<br>  <br>  To answer your question - YES!  Without Jesus we are nothing.  Apostle Paul wrote that a partial blindness has happened to the Jews until the last Gentile comes in, then all Israel will be saved.  All means both dead and alive that believed the God of the Torah.  Another thing is the "dry bones" of Ezekiel that come alive.  Israel is God's example for the world for they disobeyed God and suffered great consequences for doing so.  But God has not forgotten Israel and His covenant with their forefathers.

suBNzECvaa	Great question! I believe the weight of evidence favors a god of some sort, which is why I am a theist. In my opinion, no, there are no sound arguments for atheism.<br>  <br>  It's interesting to note (and kind of astonishing) that although there are 36 answers so far, almost all of the ones who are not theists are totally inane, and don't even try to point in the general direction of a sound argument for atheism. They all say in one way or another, we don't need to provide arguments, even saying, "The sound argument for atheism is that we don't need one." There are really only three attempts at even answering the question, and all of them fall short.<br>  <br>  Spazzy-McGee offers arguments for materialism and for authority-based epistemology, not an argument for atheism. Interestingly, authority-based epistemology is what so many atheists accuse theists of relying on (even though none of the arguments for God that you mention actually do rely on it).<br>  <br>  The fallacy in Kyle O's argument can be seen by extending it just a little further (even if all theists accepted #2, which they don't, especially Eastern-derived theists).<br>  1. Assume humans are so complex that we need a designer.<br>  2. Assume God is more complex than humans.<br>  3. Therefore God needs a designer.<br>  4. Therefore humans do not need a designer.<br>  5. But if humans do not need a designer, then it is not necessary that God needs a designer without an additional assumption.<br>  <br>  I think Andrew A Chi is on to something, that most atheists don't have a problem with God so much as they have a problem with people who believe in God, and they overgeneralize to their belief in atheism. Still, that's not a sound argument.<br>  <br>  Uh Yeah! and others assert that theism is "outlandish" and therefore requires proof, while somehow atheism is simply the default. Naturally, if you begin your analysis assuming that atheism is the default or "neutral" worldview which requires no proof itself, your conclusion will be atheism. That's no different from theists hundreds of years ago who claimed that theism was the default worldview which requires no proof itself.<br>  <br>  It's interesting to see that although so many atheists go on and on about proof and sound arguments, when it comes to their own belief in atheism, they say that no proof or sound arguments are needed.|`|cNTtxbZhaa	I myself believe in God but your logic on this is a little wrong because if you want to get down to it you can't prove anything without a reasonable doubt. It's called faith and some people don't have it or don't believe in it. Which they have every right to. You can't force someone to believe in God just the same as you can't force someone to not believe in God. Let it go because your never going to find a true answer to your question.|`|ouUkY2t7aa	Let's have a scale between 1 to 10. 1 being the most stupid of beings and 10 being the most intelligent (this scale covering EVERYTHING in the universe). We'll rate humans as 1 and God as 10. According to the Teleological argument, because of humans complexity, they had to be designed. So a number 1 is complex enough to have to be designed, but a number 10 (God) just happened? Surely God would have had to of been designed as well. Who was his designer?|`|WawGmwdIaa	"There is a god" and "I see evidence of a god" are not sound arguments for there being a god.|`|TuIdid2qaa	In all things there can be a debate. For instance, what is the most important part of a sandwich, the filling or the bread? That in itself could become an hour long issue for debate. Some may be swayed but to actually prove which is true is impossible. It is all in what one<br>   believes. So my answer would be no. But then my answer would be no even in the face of the greatest debaters. For my personal belief is that God truly IS love, and the absence of love is the absence of God. So I am unable to make a good case for atheism anyway.(and that's ok)|`|YWZdoZ39aa	Yes I have come up with my own theory comprised of others Okay Quarks are what make protons nutrons and i think electrons atraction and friction causes heat Hydrogen the most basic element and is flamable sun starts off as hydrogen the hotter the temperature the more fusion rections and the more complex of elements are created sun eventually explodes elements combined creating material material combinding creating organisms and environment organism consumes more and more material adding more and more to its stucture different material in different areas different traits one species dominates over other so one becomes pray and one becomes hunter pray becomes more defensive and agile in different condirions hunters change to be able catch specific pray evolution blah blah human. Very lightly thats my theory people could say "who created quarks" but i can say " who created gos" but I don't know I could be wrong this is my theory quarks could be made by something else but my answer to the question where did it come is this "In order for nothing to exist there has to be somthing because without something there's nothing there to identify nothing as nothing" yeah how do you like that psychological bull **** I made it up myself No name for my version of athyism i was thinking "Theorialism" or "Theorial Atheism" cause it needs a lable because Atheism starting to become the thing to do "cause all my friends are doing it" so a lot of "athiest" are going to be walk around with no real purpose making real Atheist look bad but then again maybe the fakers will try to soften it up call themselves Athys<br>      Ah yes and as for religion it's human nature search for acceptance as well as reasons for why everything is what it is and God made it takes a whole lot less effort than actually figuring it out. So with that in mind some people with quite possibly with good intentions came up with different ways to use human nature to keep people from destroying themselves and thrive and survive.|`|kkkZDoaTaa	You could write a book on this topic (which of course people have) but here's my short answer.  The idea of God is found in many religions such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.  The basis for these religions is depended mostly on the ancient holy scripts (Bible, ect.).  Sad thing is science is thought to disprove many of the ideas in these books.  For example the bible says Adam and Eve, science says evolution.  The bible says the earth is something like 4500 years old, science says 4.6 billion.  This could be one sound argument for atheists.  If a religion is based on a holy book that makes statements that are 'disproved' by science, then why believe the other parts of the book (such as the existence of a God).  These kind of inconsistencies make in extremely difficult sometimes for me to be both a neuroscience major and a Christian haha|`|JDZdPo21aa	It's really very simple.<br>  <br>  Step 1.

I have never seen any photographs of God, heaven, Jesus, etc., nor have I ever been presented with empirical evidence that they exist.<br>  <br>  Now, I realize that the unicorn/leprechaun/flying spaghetti monster argument is becoming a tired cliche, but it still illustrates an important point: Without evidence for the existence of a certain thing, it is illogical to believe that such a thing exist.  There is just as much evidence for unicorns and leprechauns (both of which are the creations of ancient myth, just like the Abrahamic God) as there is for God: None. To remain objective, one must remain in the negative stance until they find evidence supporting positive claims of existence, or else they risk tainting the integrity of their findings.<br>  <br>  I don't have evidence to disprove the notion of some kind of higher power being out there somewhere, but I do have evidence that disprove the God of the bible and the various other deities seen in human religions.  Holy books are filled with contradictions, fallacies and inaccuracies, and always conflict with what we know about the natural world.<br>  <br>  Regarding your arguments:<br>  <br>  Cosmological argument: 1) Why does the universe have to have a cause? 2) Why doesn't God need a cause?  This argument presupposes that the universe had to have a beginning, and that this beginning was caused by an intelligent being rather than a natural event.<br>  <br>  Teleological argument: Argument from design doesn't float. It's based entirely on the assumption that all order must come from an intelligent source, and about a million other assumptions as well.  This is circular reasoning.<br>  <br>  Anthropic principle: This argument can be used to support both creationism and evolution, so I'm not sure why you mentioned it.<br>  <br>  Ontological argument: I need to look this one up, since I'm not familiar with it (under the name you gave, anyway).<br>  <br>  Moral Law argument: Morality doesn't prove God.  Again, you're making assumptions; why must God exist in order for us to have a conscience?<br>  <br>  Even if any of the arguments you supplied did support the existence of a deity, they wouldn't prove that the Abrahamic god was the 'true' god.  Why not the Muslim god or the Hindu gods?  Why not Zeus or Thor?|`|ViZH5twNaa	How do you explain the complete dependence of human consciousness on the brain if our actual minds aren't bound to physical bodies? Why don't we have a center to our brain that gets signals from nowhere? Why is it one's personality can be utterly and permanently altered just by manipulating chemicals and the brain? Sounds like materialism makes a lot more sense.<br>  <br>  We assign importance to life because we are life. There is no reason for thinking life is important beyond that. Theists often say the chances of this universe existing the way it does is infinitesimal thus there must be a God. Why does this universe HAVE to be important? Why does life have to be deemed as the defining characteristic of the entire universe? The chances of getting a poker hand of a 3 of hearts, 4 of spades, 6 of diamonds, jack of spades, and an ace of clubs may be very low, but that doesn't make that specific hand important.<br>  <br>  Morality comes from our sense of right and wrong. It has been mapped in the brain. Believing in God has no effect on morality at all. It is an evolved trait to make sure we look out for members of our own tribe.<br>  <br>  "Using this logic, there are no atoms, no cells, and no South Pole (if you've never been there.)". Seeing is not the only sense, although I have seen pictures of the South Pole, cells, and atoms. Beyond that one can assign probabilities to what hasn't been observed. If my dad tells me he just saw a guy get shot I still believe it even though I didn't see it. I believe it because he told it to me, he hasn't lied to me before, and I see no reason why he would lie to me about such a topic.<br>  <br>  There are thousands of religions making the exact same claims as you with the same amount of evidence as you. It is much more likely that religion is just man made and the personal experiences people have with their own specific God is the minds ability to assign meaning to places it is not due. It's all just the echoes of thought. Praying is a very useful way of finding what one feels at very deep levels, no God involved. There is no "God sense organ" in the human mind. It is just chemical impulses echoing around. There is no magical appearance of impulses that equate to God answering your prayers telepathically. <br>  <br>  The real question is... why don't you believe in dragons given all the evidence that they exist?|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	Any existence claim requires evidence, either direct or indirect. No evidence means no belief is warranted. (Occam's razor) Note, indirect evidence, such as that gathered by others and critically reviewed, is acceptable. We can be sure atoms exist within reasonable limits (what science calls 'p' values) because the technology based on the theory works. (See Putnam's "No Miracle Argument")  <br>  <br>  Your so called arguments for God are all category mistakes, without even going into what else may be wrong with them. They all apply a priori logic to establish an empirical claim. Wrong tool for the job. <br>  <br>  As for agnosticism, it too is a lack of belief, and therefore it *is* a form of atheism. (see "weak atheism) Saying the answer is unknown is a cop out. It boils down, like my other two points, to epistemology. If we have to be 100% sure before we can claim knowledge, then all anyone knows it that they exist and are having some sort of experience. Everything else can be doubted without contradiction. Such a definition of knowledge does not account for the things we do actually know, and is therefore vacuous.

Why?  It assumes that the universe had to have a creator.  It's just as acceptable that the universe always existed. And what created the creator?  Infinite regression. <br>  <br>  Teleological - FAIL. Why?  Because the universe is so complex it had to be designed? Gag me.  The watchmaker analogy is so flawed because we can argue that the watchmaker itself had to have had an origin.  We also have Occam's Razor to cut your argument to pieces (for all of them, really). AND infinite regression, AGAIN!<br>  <br>  <br>  Ontological - FAIL. Why?  I can imagine many things that MAY exist.. doesn't mean they do.  <br>  <br>  Moral Law - FAIL!  Why?? Morality is not universal.  What I may find morally offensive may not be morally offensive to another person or society.  Morality is societal.  Those that wrote the bible had specific moral and ethical beliefs that may not be the same as those who were in China or India at the time.  <br>  <br>  The sound argument for atheism is that we don't need one.  You, the believer, must provide evidence of the outlandish claims of there being a god.  So, we don't need to disprove them.  If you prove there is a god, then that's it.  We get pwn3d and you get to go to heaven.  But, until that time, god doesn't exist. Period.<br>  <br>  And what's the attraction of atheism over agnosticism?  Not being wishy washy about "one can never really know".  That's the agnostic line.  We DO know.  Just like we know there aren't leprauchans, fairies, Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny, or unicorns.  You just don't want to accept it because you were brought up all your life being bombarded with the thought that there is this supreme being somewhere. <br>  <br>  And it's absolutely okay that you believe in it because it's a comfort for people like you.  But don't come down with these stupid arguments posited by 12th century philosophers who didn't have the luxury of knowing what we know today.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  WCWC:  Yes, atheism is the natural worldview.  One is indoctrinated into believing in a god.  A hundred years ago, if one lived in a box, without outside influence, they would not believe in a god, as it would be now (no, this is not Plato's Cave analogy).  It is then as it is now ASSUMED that god exists because one is taught that worldview.  With the rise of education, the need and belief of god usually deminished.

Any burden of proof is soundly on the theist side.  Remember that atheism does not mean "there is no god," but "I do not believe in deities or divinities."  Theism and atheism are questions of *belief* not knowledge.  Gnosticism and agnosticism are questions of knowledge.  The burden of proof is always on the claimant when discussing the existence of something.  And no, this is not an attempt to avoid the question.  It is merely demanding that a discussion on the existence of something be firmly grounded in logic and objectivity.  It would seem as though you *believe* in god, which is fine as that is a subjective statement.  If you are saying you *know* god exists, that is an objective statement and it is entirely up to you to prove it.  If you *know* god exists, it should be easy.  <br>  <br>  You said...<br>  <br>  "Neither is "I don't see any evidence," as it makes the determination of the existence of something entirely subjective. Using this logic, there are no atoms, no cells, and no South Pole (if you've never been there.) "<br>  <br>  This is pure nonsense.   The emphasis is on the word evidence.  We're talking about scientific evidence here.  The scientific method is the best way we have to learn about the natural world for the simple fact that the process is designed to be objective.  Logic is objective (when done right) and so is math.  Religion is entirely subjective.  God cannot be tested or observed so it has absolutely no place as a premise in science.  Your logic is further flawed in that you seem to be saying the evidence for the existence of god is as good as the evidence for the South Pole. You can't seriously be saying this?  <br>  <br>  As for your arguments for the existence of a god, each of them have their own problems in addition to what is posted on that site.  <br>  <br>  The kalam cosmological argument is based on a number of assumption which may or may not be true.  These assumptions include the geometry of space-time, etc.  The biggest assumption is that there was a beginning.  However, this entire argument can be dismissed as fallacious since a lack of understanding of the origins of the universe does not lead to theism.  Since when does this make sense, "I don't know if A = B, therefore C."  Your own ignorance is not proof of god.  This is simply the God of the Gaps.<br>  <br>  Likewise the teleological argument is based on some unfounded premises.  Read The Blind Watchmaker by Richard Dawkins.  I offer my own refutation in that the teleological argument is a semantic trick.  If you are convinced there was a creator, you will call the universe a creation.  Once framed that way, it very easily follows that a creation needs a creator.  This is circular logic and is confusing tautology for truism.  As that Web site says, "a watch needs a watchmaker."  The problem is, there is no evidence that this is creation, nor is there evidence for a creator.  This is not a design!  Might as well debate who designed Santa's sleigh.  Another problem is that whoever uses this argument typically does not understand natural selection.  What you say is random may not completely be random.  This argument from complexity equally fails due to the Ultimate Boeing 747 Gambit.  <br>  <br>  The Ontological argument:  This is just stupid.  Using this argument there also exists a boulder so large that God cannot lift it.  Unless.....ZOMGZ!!!  The giant black hole at the galactic core is said boulder!!!!  <br>  <br>  The Moral Law argument.  This is almost as silly.  Read up on some evolutionary psychology, game theory and ethology.  <br>  <br>  Lets not forget the argument from revelation which I do a fairly decent job of refuting here... (if I don't say so myself)<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AhzZPbGheeBgsUQegGANFGPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20080816123219AAEDcn1">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  So these "sound", "logical" arguments are neither sound nor logical.  You have utterly failed to convince me that the existence of god is a theory worth accepting.  One shouldn't need an argument *for* atheism once the arguments for theism are tossed out the window.<br>  <br>  So while most of us atheists realize we can't disprove the existence of god (not that we need to given the above) there is something else we can do.  If we can't prove that Santa doesn't exist, how can you come to a conclusion that Santa doesn't exist?  <br>  <br>  Well, we have a very good reason to believe that Santa was invented.

UhiHmnEjaa	There will always be stereotypes and you will just have to deal with it.  Everyone is affected by them.  I personally believe that stereotypes are earned not given, however, that doesn't mean that all people of that type fit that stereotype it just means that enough people have earned it for everyone else of that type.  It's not fair but it's life.  If you can find ways to prove them wrong or give them a taste of their own medicine.  Don't be defensive be offensive.  Insult them back.  I've found it works more than anything else.|`|K0mvCFhEaa	Its a stereotype that blondes are stupid.<br>  <br>  Ignore them.|`|hwbkyNhZaa	I have a neice that is a natural blond.

If you said yes, they would leave a jacko lantern out side your door.  We have the remnants of it still here.  Saint Patric, he drove the snakes out of Ireland.

Studying the occult, can unlock the mysteries of mind, myth, magick, nature, and the world around you.   What you do with this is up to you.   You will find what it is you are looking for, in all things.    Before attempting to truly know and understand something, it is best to know and understand youself, else, you may not be prepared for what you may find.

Here is why your mind is week    BIBLE: KJV according to sourses:  What does God call them?   Preach love to them?  Lets see what God says, to do with them.    You have unbeliever's, Chaff, Scoffers.pagan, neo pegan, witches.    An Atheist is a "scoffer". The WORD of God, clearly tells, ATHEISTS are filhty rags they are, and to stay away from them, and avoid them. We are NOT to plant seeds. God knows it is useless and that is why he tells us, "You stand firm against them" ( Jer.17:8  14:1  Iah 44:4)  You disassociate them completely. Any Believer that does not abide in God's own Word, does not know God, according to God Himself.   Atheists are "chaff" A simile of the wretchedness of the wicked. Chaff is carried away by the lightest wind, and it's removal brings about cleansing by extracting what is utterly useless. (Ruth 1:22). They will NOT stand in the judgment. They will NOT be able to withstand God's wrath when He judges.( Pslams 76:7  Exra 9:15). This is not my opinion, this is God's very own Words, in the Bible. You know, the BIble? The same Bible atheist scholars quote. There is a reason God, said this. Psalms.1.1-3  Jer. 17:8   14:1   12. 1-2  18:9-10  Prov1.10-19  (vs 5) scoffers:(atheists) those who ridicule God and definatley reject His Law.  Prov 1.:22  Ruth 1:22 Jer 18:7  (pull down-destroy) 1:10  (evil-calamity) 18:11    Pslams 1:   godly wisdom here, declare the final outcome of the two "ways". The paths of "sinners" (unbelievers) and the "way of the righteous. he speaks progressively of assoociation with the ungodly and participation in they're ungodly ways.    God said it.  End of Story.   Jesus Himself said "Let the dead bury they're dead".    Use all the Internet and Dictionaries they want to and call themselves anything they wish. God "defined" what they are by His own Holy Word.    They can hang a dog tag* around they're neck in the pits if hell itself and separate each other by name categorically.    God's Word said it. By God's definition. They are nothing but filthy rags. There is NO opinion.    Hate? Where do you get hate? If God's TRUTH is hate too you, then, so be it.

It is possible that this is a way for parents to look on the positive side when faced with bringing up children with problem behavior.  It's unclear why so many children now are hyperactive, poorly socialized, and so on.  Perhaps it's a result of over-stimulation from television, additives in foods, or impurities in the air.|`|2f16c85009d52eb6bad5aa4f253b5862aa	I've been called an "indigo child" time and time again and i'm gettin a lil tired of it. When i close my eyes and 'meditate' if you will.. i can see colours that bounce off not only every living thing but everything else as well. My gf went.. "Oh my God! You can see auras! You're so cool!" *Groan* Here's my opinion. Too many people with too much fukcin time that we're headed back to the "peace n love" stage again, with a difference. Why the heck do we need to 'understand our past' to understand our present? All that's necessary if you ask me is a passion to live our current lives and to just keep moving, taking and making a stand to do good. I've been told by fortune tellers and card readers and 'spiritual' people from everywhere that i used to be part of the occult when in my past life and that i was a very powerful man and bla bla bla. Here's what i think of that. I don't give a **** who i used to be. I'm trying to make a difference in the world here and now and have other people on this planet realise not only what's happening around us but to take a step forward and do something about it. Indigo kids and such nonsense? Don't waste your time. I haven't seen or heard of anyone in our time being able to split a red sea yet ;o)|`|81ce8fc06e11149869860f71cb7ee933aa	Most Indigo children are undisciplined children.

Indigos existed before the new age thing, and the phenomena that truly identified Indigos showed up before as well,     the distinction is very obvious when your close to it.   for starters by time kids who truly are indigo or similar are in their early teens... they'll likely be surpassing their parents in spiritual/supernatural awareness and understanding, and teaching their parents things.     ADHD stuff...  well this too has a big difference. for starters authentic ADHD people in their unmedicated state, at an equivalent age, will have trouble focusing even if they are interested in whats going on.  an Indigo or similar will have no issue concentrating if its actually interesting and something they have a reason to pay attention to.    big difference.    like so many other things... some of it is authentic, and some is fake, and to those who aren't in the fold, the difference can be entirely indistinguishable, even when its an obvious, clear distinction for those directly involved or connected to it.|`|AA12050379	I hadn't read that about indigo kids.    I heard they were intelligent, active, intuitive, spiritual, etc.    Never read the low opinion of others stuff.  Where did you get that?    Edit add:  Antisocial in the psychology world is typically referred to those without a conscience who engage in criminal behavior and violate others frequently.

The Prodestants were no longer a part of the Roman Catholic Church by that date.    ------------------------------  There is a great deal of overlap between the Apocrypha section of the King James Bible and the Catholic deuterocanon, but the two are distinct. The Apocrypha section of the King James Bible includes, in addition to the deuterocanonical books, the following three books, which are not in the Catholic canon.    1 Esdras (also known as 3 Esdras)   2 Esdras (also known as 4 Esdras)   Prayer of Manasses     These three books alone make up the Apocrypha section of the Clementine Vulgate, where they are specifically described as "outside of the series of the canon".|`|b26381cb7fcd52f739266245bbd454f6aa	The 14 books you refer to in the OT have never been recognized byt the Jewish people as part of their testament, which christians call the OT.

John 14:6|`|2307cd0b3ef26e9214119d4c867a84b5aa	Let me put it this way. In Christianity we believe that God is the only true God.... But as far as all the other religons and so fourth they are all touched by man who in essance was created by God. No religion is perfect because it is touched by man and man is not perfect. I am not the norm for the Christian faith because I know there are alot of them out there and on here that give it a bad rap But I feel I should live my life in a way that would be pleasing to God and the only way to do that is to strive to be like Christ. No I don't think anyone on earth can truly be that way but I try my hardest and I try to love all people. God also gave all people free will to choose their path in life so this could be just one reason. Oh and just so you know I did do this thinking open minded and with out the bible in front of me....|`|53ef179045ae738b05626a3e69b99773aa	U can change the name of religion but teachings of all the prophets were nearly same.  * love God and his creations.  *always speak the truth.   *seek knowledge.  *condenm all forms of wrong doings. etc  all the prophets believed  in the prophethood of other prophets.  god bestowed prophethood to many people to revise his teachings.  in this way good things are revised under supervision of God.|`|40a4feb139015a77173fe96f03662c56aa	No.  He gave us free will to do as we liked with the goal for us to worship Him of our own accord.

God does not allow bad things to happen to good ppl that's the      devils job.  2. yes to me learnin about the past is fascinating|`|AA10059504	Learning is good.  One of the prerequisites for learning is to already have the knowledge that you DON'T know it all.  Another prerequisite for learning is to already have the knowledge that so called "experts" are almost certainly wrong on at least some issues.    Consider the state of medical "science" not two hundred years ago, and compare it to the holistic and herbal practices of "witches" that were so ruthlessly surpressed and (mostly) lost during the middle ages.     Consider that only a few hundred years ago (an eyeblink in the span of human history)  most "experts" believed the world to be flat, and the earth to be the center of the universe.    There are few people more incapable of learning than the sophomoric recipient of an "education" in our current system, steeped in sublime certainty that THEY KNOW and anyone who disagrees with them is (obviously) WRONG. Many of those "educated" persons are confident atheists, and hold only contempt for believers.  Awash in their arrogance and certainty, it never occurs to them to wonder why some of the finest minds in the history of man DID believe.    So - "Why does God let bad things happen...?"  I don't know. Nobody else knows either, and the more they try to convince me that they DO know the more I suspect their motives and distrust them as a source of ANY information.   Obviously one explanation would be that there simply is no God. To attempt to use "bad things happen" as PROOF that there is no God is childish in the extreme.  If you build an image of "God" as a being that wouldn't let bad things happen you haven't proven that God doesn't exist - you've only proven that God doesn't exist as the being that YOU envision him to be.    If their IS a God, I suspect that the answer involves free will, and the truism that without free will there would be "no game" and the world would be awfully boring...    The remains of Noah's ark found? I'm skeptical. This isn't the first time the ark has been "discovered."  Still, there's an awful lot in the bible that's been proven to be historically accurate and scoffers have been proven wrong by fresh evidence on many biblical history issues.      Yes, learning is addictive, and the proper exercise of your ability to reason may be the most satisfying action known to man. (Well, okay - maybe SECOND most satisfying...) The more you learn, the easier you'll find it to distinguish between the very few who really hunger for truth and knowledge, and the vast majority who only seek confirmation of their present beliefs and their secure place in the herd.  Seek out persons who hunger for truth - you'll find they contribute greatly to your knowledge, your happiness and your life.  Good luck to you!|`|AA12036288	It's for a purpose everything and everyone has a purpose. Like if I tripped fell on my face it was for a purpose but it seems unlikely.

6904d3be59e51dd5061915d46aadef76aa	1. Two of every animal? Scientists with modern technology still haven't discovered every animal on the face of the Earth.    2. The Earth was flooded by massive rains, right? Therefore the floodwater was fresh water. 75% of the Earth's surface is covered in salt water. Adding another 25% fresh would make the water "brackish" and kill all the fish, whether they live in fresh or salt water. So Noah also had to get two of every fish, even those deep-sea fish that modern scientists can't bring up from the ocean floor.    3. Barely any plants on Earth can survive submerged in "brackish" water for very long, so Noah would have had to get those too.    4. Noah would have had to have travelled to the North and South Poles, the Sahara and the Amazon to collect animals. On doing that, he had to install conditions that they can survive in (polar bears would sweat to death in Middle Eastern heat, elephants need wide savannahs to roam.)    5. He would have needed food for all these animals, including the carnivores, but he couldn't feed both the antelopes to both the lions, now could he? He'd have had to take spare prey animals.    6. Now, Noah would have to keep the animal's enclosures quite separate from each other to prevent them fighting or scaring each other, so the actual enclosure section of the Ark, in containing every living being on the planet with enough space for it to roam, would easily have to be bigger than a city. It would probably be closer to a medium-sized country.    7. Now, the Ark, with its enclosure section the size of a country, would still need to float. Therefore it must have a base spread out enough to support the weight, and the Ark would probably end up being much larger than Europe.    8. And, as a result of the huge size of this Ark, it couldn't have a flat bottom. If it did both ends would probably be poking out of the water, because the Earth is round and the boat would be like a line set at a tangent to a sphere. So the bottom of the boat would have to be concave to fit on the planet's round surface and actually float.    And supposedly this one guy and his sons built this thing in their backyard in three years??? It works from the perspective of the writers of the Bible, when all they knew where a hundred or so animals and they thought the Earth was small and flat.    It sounds like one of those religious metaphors to me.|`|AA11159703	That's right.

God bless you and your family .|`|AA12327954	Here you go:    http://www.absolutetruth.net/creation/pa... - here is just a little piece of the action!     DID THE FLOOD OF NOAH COVER THE WHOLE WORLD?    Many have questioned on the extent of the Flood the Bible records in the first portion of the book of Genesis. The Bible tells us that God saw the wickedness of mankind and that every "thought of his heart was evil." He decided to Flood the earth and destroy all life. Furthermore, the Lord singled out the last remaining righteous family, that of Noah. He commanded Noah to build an ark (large boat) to save his family and two of each animal from the coming Flood judgment on the earth.     Because of the miraculous nature of gathering the animals, flooding the entire planet, and the destruction of all living things except for those in the ark, some have suggested that the Flood was only local, not worldwide. That is, they suppose that only a region where Noah lived was flooded, and the rest of the world was untouched.    There are some fundamental problems with that view:    1) God asked Noah and his family to gather two of every animal to put into the ark, and when Noah's family had done so, God destroyed the world with a flood during which "everything on the face of the earth was wiped out" and "everything that moved on the earth perished". (See Genesis 6-9) This could not have been accomplished unless the entire world was flooded.  The Bible's language on this point is very clear, and so to deny the universality of the Flood is also to deny that the Bible is truthful.    2) To say the flood was local is to call God a liar. God placed the rainbow in the sky after the Flood as a promise to Noah and all mankind, saying "Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life." If the Flood was local, and God was saying that He would never again send a local flood, history would have proved Him wrong! There are local floods all the time. However, we do serve a God who keeps His promises through all time, and He will never send a worldwide flood again.    3)  The local flood view fails to deal with the amazing amount of evidence we have for a worldwide flood.  Most fossils are formed in flood conditions, and most areas of the earth's surface indicate flooding.  Many geologists believe that the Flood of Noah's day did much to shape the landforms we see today!    So...

Based on the hebrew calendar and other teachings, a year to us is 1,000 years to God... Also, he "allowed" people to live longer than we do these days. In the bible it says that he told Adam , that as punishment for his betrayal, he wouldn't live to be a day older... So, if 1 day = 1,000 years... Adam lived around 900 something... It went downhill from there, so Noah was around 700-800 something... and thus had several hundred years and enlisted the help of many others to help in his quest... I can't explain anything else as you requested to not receive anything about the continents not forming... but, keep in mind, dispersion and "evolution", if you believe in it...  takes hundreds, if not thousands or millions of years... so, it wouldn't be hard for flora and fauna to spread over said period of time over all land masses wether or not they were joined together... I've never heard of the "Amazon/ Great Lakes" theory... What I stated I've learned as a kid going to church... it's really about what you believe... many people are more religious and others are more scientific about biblical events... So... before you dismiss this as more "bullshit"... It's what I believe, but I don't go forcing it or preaching it to anyone...|`|AA12026572	Since the ark has been found, there is proof.

I do however want you to know that your not alone.

Remember Jesus's words "when the world hates you, remeber that they hated me first." . Keep your faith, dont let anything turn you around from trusting and serving Jesus. Infact, Im very proud of you because you have made a large stepp and are following in the footsteps of many jews in the Biblical times who decided to take a step of faith and follow Jesus.

Isaiah 11:6 The wolf will live with the lamb,          the leopard will lie down with the goat,          the calf and the lion and the yearling [a] together;          and a little child will lead them.     Genesis 1:29-31    29 Then God said, "I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food. 30 And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air and all the creatures that move on the groundeverything that has the breath of life in itI give every green plant for food." And it was so.      31 God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morningthe sixth day.    God created man to live off of the fruits and vegetables of the earth and the same for the animals. Man chose to fall not the animals as you can read in Romans 8. Because of this animals are not held accountable for they did not choose to fall but because they were upon the earth when Man chose to fall, they also fell. Everything that was upon the earth at that time, fell with the earth.    Romans 8 says that all creation cannot wait to be redeemed and so it is implied they shall be redeemed for they were created so they are creations. Man on the other hand chose to fall therefore he must repent and accept Christ as his Savior and live according to Gods will, not his own (mans will).

For instance, they could eat yummy mammoth meat or drink water in rivers or eat fruit on trees.  They then figured someone must have put it there for them.  Since they could create spears and such, whoever made the trees must have been a bigger version of them.    Thus, we have the beginning of religion.  Religion has always been based on the idea that mankind is special, and the universe must have been made by something more or less like a person, even though we now know that the universe is 15 billion years old and mankind has only been around for a tiny fraction of that time.    Anthropocentrism and vanity, then.|`|b0365ad4611bf2fc46ae5a64737e2a52aa	Why do you have to be someone? The creator is a person. You are a person.

God is not mortal so I don't think he is "someone" but we can't call him "it" it's not respectable, you wouldn't call your earthly father "it". What other way can God be described.|`|9caf19cee8c3482039d1e57f694892ceaa	I am not sure how your refering to "Someone" but "Someone" seems to me to be just a word that people are familiar with, as it is a localized and singular entity.  Could not the creator be "several", but as one?  It is a hard concept to grasp, (I can't even say that I understand it).  One might say, "Something", but then again a thing is a particular identity.  So in the end there are some parts of the Bible that I believe and I believe that we are made in "Gods" image, but don't think that is a big guy in the sky, I don't even believe it is a gender, but more of an "awareness".  I think that is what I believe the "creator", (what we call God), meant as we have an awareness, (his/her/it/God's image).    Brian|`|495690a19c04a45ae7595969a13537a4aa	God is ofcourse not a person, nor is god light, these are metaphors, when the bible says god made mankind in his image, it means man has the qaulitys of free will and we are sentient beings. Not that we look like god.  God is neither male or female, when the bible refers to our 'father'  it is a metaphor. like a father god is our creator, and like a father we are not him, also god gives us the spark of life but it is metaphoricaly the mother thats gives us our bodies.  In early faiths the sun was worshiped because it gave light and life to the earth mother and her children. This does not mean they believed the sun to be god but a good metaphor for god|`|AA10063516	Just like the song in the sound of music:    "Nothing comes from nothing, nothing ever could"    Things do not just organize it self by chance.|`|efe68eebbcf746ed435c2822eeb1c48daa	The idea of God being "someone" is a concept that most people can comprehend.  The use of the word "someone" has a two-fold effect:    1) it allows us to conceptualize an omnipresent being using our limited cognitive skills  2) the use of "someone" implies some one as in a personal, living being versus a "thing"    Such a concept is akin to referring to God as our Father, when in reality God is neither male or female.  Our concept of God reflects a patriarchal(male-dominated society) versus a matriarchal society.

Then there are some like Yizak Rabin's assassination, and 9/11 that were supposedly predicted, and happened as you know.       Basically it's all based on belief.

Science comes up with 'ID' as a possibility, and then they blame it on creationist. Then they come up with the 'string' to really complicate what they already do not understand.

94e6979d7e47c3b9ae0c5391f7976561aa	Panentheism is a term that comes out of a type of theology known as "process theology."    "Panentheism says that all is in God, somewhat as if God were the ocean and we were fish. If one considers what is in God's body to be part of God, then we can say that God is all there is and then some. The universe is God's body, but God's awareness or personality is greater than the sum of all the parts of the universe. All the parts have some degree of freedom in co-creating with God. "    The website I post below has a discussion of panentheism, especially explaining the difference between it and pantheism.    I am also posting the link to the Center for Process Studies which has resources you might like to look at.|`|d20a5da34a236b3c2d21503b2f61dabcaa	http://www.gotquestions.org/panentheism....|`|AA11215767	It's a religion that has many gods.|`|AA11317725	Google it or Wikipedia it.

ed66b07e22542ef6b68123289fc5aa8faa	Si te lo dijo un sacerdote o pastor cristiano, ten por seguro que "para ellos si es pecado" pero no es pecado "dar dinerito a una noble causa" para comprar y gastar en lujos como siempre hacen.    Ahora bien, si no fue asi, no es pecado porque ha de serlo, todo es fictisio y virtual, no existen tales personas de carne y hueso dentro de un videojuego que sufran, etc, y tampoco es propicio a eso, porque preguntate:    Cuando vas al cine y ves Rambo matando con granadas, metralletas, etc a cientos de Arabes, y disfrutaste la pelicula apoco es pecado? no lo es porque es una historia, igualmente ficticia con personajes representando a personajes, mas sin embargo de seguro si ves la tv donde hay un atentado terrorista, o hechos violentos reales si lo ves mal, y es obio porque sabes que es "real" son personas que sufren etc    Un videojuego, una pelicula, un libro, etc, no lo es, son historias y personajes creados, mas sin embargo puedes ver peliculas, libros, etc basados en la vida real y eso conmueve porque lo sabes. Nos identificamos como seres humanos a traves de nuestras experiencias y sentimientos.    Si juegas GTA (que soy fan) y tiroteas, atropellas, golpeas policias, disfruta y maneja el personaje de GTA para lo cual fue creado para divertir y presentar las ironias de la vida, y como es, recuerda cuando jugabas cuando eras ni?o y traias una pistola de juguete hechabas y aventabas disparos aqui y alla, en tu imaginacion.     En un videjouego es lo mismo, solo que aqui por decirlo asi, manejas monitos, virtuales muy reales, al menos en el remoto caso, que es casi imposible que despues de jugar vayas a ser eso igual que el juego, tu sabes que no es posible.    Asi que diviertete y si puedes compra otro fregon, yo juge hace poco uno de guerra y me gusto mucho, entiendes mas no sientes (no estube ahi) lo que pasa un soldado en la guerra, a pesar de divertirte.

As a matter of fact the constant giving of gifts will drive most away that are worth being a true friend. Normal is boring!!! I go out of my way to scare normals all the time!

I don't have specifics to work on so I'll try talking in abstracts.<br>  <br>  In a species driven by selection and inheritance, in the instinctual need to be successful and propagated, the answer to your initial question may be Yes. I think perhaps it is true for all of us. Both men and women must select their mate, or in turn be selected. Whether we like it or not, or intend it or not, this selection process in ongoing and constant. <br>  <br>  But is this instinctual process that we all undergo fair or necessary within the civilised world which we inhabit? No. <br>  Humans are unfortunately far from free of their primitive ancestry, and for all of us, it is a constant struggle to bridge that gap between the unthinking reaction, and the intelligent decision. We undoubtedly have a long way to go before our tolerance and acceptance matches our aspirations to such,<br>  <br>  Here on the net, is an interesting position for this question. Neither I nor anyone else know what you look like, or understand your reasons for wishing change. To us you are just like any of the rest of the users - Anonymous equal intelligences, mere written echoes of the people who sit behind our screens typing out these replies. Your question seems so obvious from our perspective: Of course you do not live for the approval of men - or anyone else for that matter. Here, you are equal as a voice amongst many. <br>  <br>  I can not offer you a God given explanation or miracle, because I don't believe in God or miracles. Indeed a story such as yours only gives me a rueful sense of lacking justice which could only stem from an unregulated world.<br>  I wish that I as a human being could offer you some sort of comfort that would allow you to see that there is acceptance and tolerance in the world for all of us, regardless of how we look and feel. It took me a long time to find a place (mental as well as physical) that I belonged to, but it is possible. <br>  I would hope things do improve for you, and I do recommend thinking on the issues and hobbies that interest you and pursuing them for your own sake, and with passion. Do not do things simply because others would wish you to. These are the true ways in which we develop as people, and usually the ways in which we meet others.<br>   More than anything though, do not lose sight of the fact that you are as special and individual as anyone else in the human race. If you begin to feel inadequate or unworthy, then you give into despair and I don't think there is any worse feeling in the world than loneliness. I would wish that feeling on nobody.<br>  <br>  When people judge you as a person entirely on your appearance, the transgression is theirs, not yours. Besides which, such people are selfish and not worth knowing.<br>  Some people may not know how to respond upon seeing you, but then Humans do have an instinctual narrow band of definition over what a person is supposed to look like. Do not judge them too harshly for that, they can not help it. What counts is how that person proceeds to interacts with you. Anyone in our society who has overcome their instincts and prejudices (like we all should) will seek to know you as the person you really are. <br>  Do not approach others and be concerned over what they are thinking about you. We can all drive ourselves nuts trying to work out if someone likes us, and if they do, we drive ourselves even more nuts trying to work out why they like us!<br>  <br>  I hope very much that you will meet these decent people far more often in the future. You, like all of us deserve that recognition.<br>  |`|234e97b394a4df734de2011bac1d758caa	I agree with the people above me 100%, especially Sue. :) It all depends on the attitude. Just be positive (smile and laugh every change you get, especially when people look at you first), and don't hesitate to talk to people. There is NO WAY people will think of you as a weird person if you do that, unless they are the type of people you shouldn't be around. If anything, you will brighten up their day. :)<br>  <br>  I noticed back when I was shy, I didn't have many friends, but after developing a more positive and outgoing personality, I gained some true friends.

Stop being shallow, looks aren't everything and get a personality...  <br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  get plastic surgery and then be overly happy with yourself, run around and sleep with every guy you can because you finally feel like you have some worth... and then feel empty because it was just sex.. and nothing more<br>  <br>  or 3rd.. get some counseling, realize you are a person and have something to offer this world besides looks... <br>  |`|g288r5Mgaa	Hey,I do not think so.<br>  <br>  Please do not pay much attention to those bored people and just do what you want and be yourself.<br>  <br>  Everybody has his opinion,and you are the only one.So please take it easy.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.discount4dvd.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.discount4dvd.com/</a>|`|zcvs5iZMaa	Never live for anyone but you.

AA10138808	quotes from the bible have always been used to push one ideas onto others.    I think Exodus says if your neighbor works on the sabbath you are to smite him...    So do we have the right to kill people who work on the sabbath??  NO of course not    So if John wants to sleep with Jake let them; if Jane wants to sleep with Jill let them.    What people do in the privacy of their own home is their business, this is one of the many reason why religion is really wrong for society. religious denomination think that they have a right to tell people what they can and can not do.|`|AA11902108	"lie-ing" is not the same as having it shoved up you- only Islamic countries kill rape VICTIMS...    you're taking all this out of context- it was MOSAIC law that became null with Christ's New Covenant...    You can be as Gay as you want- it's between you and God when you die...|`|0f38c5bad63749469c6145b9927f9096aa	in this verse it doesn't say anything about rape. I do believe that if it happens as a rape, the raper is at fault not the person getting raped.|`|AA12036288	What?|`|7a26e887f1c5f6c916f0d12d075e8cc9aa	rape is a sin too, and it's illegal, u should probably stick with being gay|`|1dfc92107a6a2320e20ac84f31f23808aa	You're making no sense.Homosexuality as a crime.Take off your clothes, wear tree bark and go live in a cave.|`|362b704565dd41499f57bdbff2176c8caa	You know, it is a saying and I suppose that there is a right way to look at the phrase, and a wrong way. It's just that nothing comes to mind on that phrase. I don't think so.    But to me, it sets up a Chirstian to think that he is somekind of sinless prick. You know, the " I've got to stop the sinning in the world" types. It gets so far off the true message of Christ, " believe, and you will be saved " message.|`|AA12360781	there is no such thing as sins us gay people are just different in a small kind of way its not a sin.|`|90da8b52a4332b07fad72a7615606c3caa	In the New Testament, love the sinner and hate the sin is the policy used. In the event of rape, this  may be hard for the person whose privacy and personality has been abused and hurt - they have been a victim of a crime done by a sorry and sadistic individual.  No rape victim voluntarily submits to the act, which is why it is called as rape; therefore the person is not guilty, even though the person has been violated - therefore they are not condemned. As for homosexuality, it is not a way of feeling, but something very deeply wrong and having it's roots to disturb the God given sexuality to make mock of it. It has deep roots right down to the time of Soddom and Gommorah and is nothing but a tool of the enemy to make mockery of God, unfortunately we humans use it to defend ourselves, and not think tat there is some sort of unholy connection to this feeling. Anything outside the Word in terms of sexual relationships is wrong, even other religions like Islam and Hinduism look down on the concept of homosexuality.   Nature itself, where there are two different sexes, like in the lions, horses, dogs, I am not sure if they have recorded homosexuality between the species. There is a very clear distinction between the genders and they do not cross that. If nature listens to her creator, it is sorry to know that man who is created in the image of God cannot understand it.|`|baad8ffdd3e394f55c395726f4efa206aa	Wait, wait, wait.  I think I have to disagree with statement  1: It's not just the action one takes.  We commit sin by even having unlcean thoughts!  God doesn't address it in Leviticus because He was just laying down some basics, but in Hebrews 4:12b, we can see that "it [the word of God] judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart."  It's our thoughts as well as our actions that God sees.  "Nothing in all creation is hidden from God's sight(v.13)."    I know it wasn't the point of your post, but it had to be said.

God do not take a step closer to you or reveal Himself to you.  As individuals you pray to God and if you are sincere you advance in spirituality and humbleness.    Muslims worship Allah just like Jews, Christians and Hindus worship God.  There is only one Supreme God and every religion's followers just worship in different ways.    Islam is a way of life just as Judaism, Christianity and Hinduism.  Each teach its followers spirituality and peace with mankind and God.  What is wrong is that in all religions there are groups who are fanatic fundamentalist and take their beliefs to extreme measures.  This Fanatic fundamentalism is not restricted to Islam, every religion has its group of wrong-doers and righteous people.|`|AA12393877	Do nothing.

There are levels of praying also and one of them is praying 5 times a day.  I or anyone can't really tell who be more closer to God but at least I know I have tried to do everything that he has ordered me to do and that is to make this world a little better.|`|76ac6c46964c2033ec9191e5d1d2de83aa	Quite amazing that for a question of Muslims so many non-muslims have bothered to answer.       It is said that when you pray to Allah, you take a step closer to Him, and He takes ten steps towards you.    The idea of Allah revealing himself to an individual in this life does not exist in Islam. The Quran is a guidance to those who believe in the unseen and ward off evil. These people need Guidance from their Lord.     No has seen God except Prophet Muhammad(PBUH) when he was Ascended to the heaven ( this event is called as Miraj).    As for seeing Allah, you get to see him after the day of judgement if you are rewarded heaven on the basis of Your deeds in this life or by His Mercy.    You cannot see God before that. Believe in the Unseen and remain Steadfast and Righteous. Seek the Truth.    God is not like the Images of deities we see.  And the moment God can be compared to anything in the world, He is not in the defination of God.    There is Only One God, Allah.  He is almighty  He was neither begotten nor he did he beget  And there is nothing in this world comparable to Him.    If anybody has these four characteristics.....  that is   He is One, he does not have any partener  He has no parent and is parent to no one. HE HASN'T BEEN CREATED BY ANY ONE.  And there is nothing in this world that can be compared to Him, which means a human form, or any other thing that we can imagine is not God because we can imagine it.  If any 'force' (we dont know anything about what he is, we know through Qu'ran how he is) has these characteristics, WE THE MUSLIMS ARE READY TO EXCEPT THIS AS GOD, AS ALLAH.      P.S. In the hereafter, Those who well get a view of God will look at Him for several long years continuously unimaginably 'amazing'( again not a proper word talking of Him) as He will be.

She used to visit me in my dreams. Her name was Valerie. She used to give me moral support and told me I was her son, but she lived during Colonial Times. That kind of scared me a bit. She was real nice. She wore a White Victorian Dress, had black hair, and fair skin. I wasn't the only one in my house to see her. My 2 sisters also did and my mom saw her a few times. She visited me the most. I guess because of what she said. Occasionally we would catch a glimpse of her while we were awake in the halway or hear the cabinet openning downstairs. We stopped seeing her when we moved. I kind of miss her though. Yeah you might think I'm crazy for admitting it, but like I said other members of my family saw her too. It really gave me something to think about.|`|AA10848331	Yes, it was spooky!|`|d81f57c7bba15af76da61ed8d234c703aa	I have always lived with ghosts, even got a few good pictures.
7186863d9a223b5094210919f84ec436aa	It is only God who konws the answer on  whatever is in the heart of Charles Darwin regarding this matter and nobody really can't know God's grand desire. Most people when faced with grief and trial lost their faith in the Almighty God. Maybe Charles Darwin with the death of His daughter Annie, wasn't able to bear this trial that came in his life thus his attitudes towards Christianity. Nobody knows and we therefore have no right to judge a persons attitude.|`|c9266f597c273599a812141734386281aa	"Then his treasured daughter Annie fell ill, reawakening his fears that his illness might be hereditary. After a long series of crises, she died and Darwin lost all faith in a beneficent God." thats what is written in Wikepedia. You are changing the Wikepedia quote.    Eitherways Darwin did a great scientific discovery. His evolution theory was formulated way before 1851, which was when his daughter died. So, his evolution theory had nothing to do with the question you are raising.|`|cf754701079a539aa0d2f31d2a7ba2e0aa	You are like the rest of the creatinists, you read something twist it into your own quote, claiming that it is accurate and then build a fallacious premise on faulty evidence.    In other words you lie, lie, and lie some more.    As to the actual question, NO, Darwin was a scientist, albeit not a very good one, but he was a scientist nonetheless. He and others saw what others had ignored for many decades, natural selection. He had no motives other than to decipher how the natural world works. To state otherwise is fallacious!|`|618783bb3688632e3fa1d8194cbf4c02aa	Wouldn't it be a better arguement that he lost his faith as he gained more and more knowledge as to how things work?|`|AA10848331	I doubt it, and he certainly wasn't nursing an erection under his cassock whilst in the proximity of altar boys...|`|AA10181372	I don't think that was it.|`|ab029a498215848f7424a5da90f7c847aa	Did you read the section talking about his time in seminary?

I think that the brain is something that, in your scenario, can be transplanted because it is tangible, an actual part of the human anatomy.  But what of the soul?  Where does the soul reside?  It isn't inside the finger or the femur, or the heart or the stomach, or the brain.  Rather, it is all, a part of us, external of us, and all around us.  It is the very raw essence of our energy.  So, if I believe in that, then I would think that if a brain transplant were possible, the only thing that I could hope to have happen is that I would have brain function again, ability to have a heart beat without conscious thought of it beating, breathing, without having to think it over.  The brain is just the automatic pilot for bodily functions.  The soul, however, is a much more durable and long lasting part of who we are.  Our soul, in my opinion, transcends sexuality, outward appearance, attitude, or any other human-esque description.  Our soul is pure energy, which is neither created nor destroyed, it just is.  It learns through experience, chooses experiences to have, and its function is spiritual evolution.  At least, that is what I think, with so much more. Transplanting a brain, if possible, woul dbe no different than transplanting any other organ.  A soul, however, is reincarnated, a spiritual transplant, I suppose.

There aren't any people "destined" for hell, they made that choice themselves|`|AA11317725	John 3:16|`|AA10185649	well said KITTEN---  so many anti-religous idiots trying for support in here.|`|AA10204554	Scripture teaches that God allows heathens to co-exist with His Chosen ones becasue (Matthew 13) His Chosen Ones couldn't handle it right now if God destroyed them right now.    ..and (Romans) God has made some for Noble purposes and some for destruction...to show HIS Chosen ones mercy.    It is all to God's Glory...all part of His plan..and all for His Chosen Ones benefit..  Praise Him!!    Matthew 13:27-30 (NKJV)    So the servants of the owner came and said to him, 'Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have tares?' 28He said to them, 'An enemy has done this.' The servants said to him, 'Do you want us then to go and gather them up?' 29But he said, 'No, lest while you gather up the tares you also uproot the wheat with them. 30Let both grow together until the harvest, and at the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, "First gather together the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn." ' "     Romans 9:21-24 (NKJV)    Does not the potter have power over the clay, from the same lump to make one vessel for honor and another for dishonor? 22What if God, wanting to show His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath prepared for destruction, 23and that He might make known the riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy, which He had prepared beforehand for glory, 24even us whom He called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?

AA11317725	You bet it does!|`|8276fe09a930406f0fa15c60ea31aea8aa	Improvements in prediction technology for pregnancy will not have an effect on abortion rates as they exist already.  As for abortions, individuals already know before having sex whether or not they will get an abortion if they get pregnant.|`|AA11581131	No it only helps the people (couples) that want a certain sex (male) KILL the female embryos. All done with your blessing, by the sound of your question.  Also your question lacks any reguard for the rape victims and abused women and children that are hopelessly praying for the return of their lives - before the abuse turned their lives into hell on earth. Living 9 months with the face of the abuser reflected in mirros is inhuman of you to impose. Also all the ACCUSATIONS of "she asked for it" or WORSE by the holier than thous out there. No one treats MEN this way? WHY?? Bing kicked out of a loving family because the family NAME is ruined? SHES THE VICTIM!!! NOT THE ABUSER!!! CARE FOR HER!! Throw HIM in jail!  These improvements are wonderful tools NEEDED by COUPLES with proven MEDICAL HISTORIES - that are scared, and these new tools stop the nightmares. (Ask your wife if she was ever scared during her pregnancy   I HOPE SHE NEVER WAS. But many are scared.)  As you are ANTI abortion - what is your overall plan to ensure MEN do NOT ABUSE young girls and women? How can you control a man wanting his wife to have 14 -15 kids - when they are unemployed? If your agenda can control MEN - I may not be so scared of what you intend for women. Also if I hear stories of after midnight backstreet abortions - because you removed all the health care, I may not forgive you. Do you remember the 40/50/60's at ALL?????? So many died - because MEN used date-rape drugs, or name your horror, lies - etc. to get what they wanted at the expence of women.   If women all women were of a single mind that would help to. I also will be so tired of the stories of the well off going to other countries for SAFE, CLEAN abortions while the poor are dying in back alleys. REMEMBER ANY OF THIS?|`|5dc2c80e3b59baad4e676f47b56473faaa	Threaten the agenda?  No, but will it have some impact on the industry? Yes.    Fetal photographs have existed for decades. Many of us have seen the endoscopic images on the Discovery channel, and the Pulitzer(?) Prize winning photo of a fetus reaching out of the womb during an operation to hold the finger of the Doctor doing surgery to repair her(?) Spina Bifida.    This technology may add a personal quality to a pregnancy, but I don't think it changes the fundamental motivations for abortion which are many: poverty, unplanned/unprepared pregnancy, no perceived chance for child to have a good life when relationship with father ends, etc.     So long as people must face these realities, and abortion is an option, the agenda will continue because of demand. The people want it, and they're willing to pay for it.      The question is: What, after all, does it cost?

Who are the women since before the turn of the last century who have been considered sex icons?    All of them have had "curves" and were not skin and bones.    There was a woman named Russell (I forgot her first name) who was considered very beautiful at 250 lbs.    Jane Mansfield, Marilyn Monroe, Betty Grable, Jane Russell, jean Harlowe, etc. None of them were skinny.  Look at the Greco/Roman statues.  Look at paintings by Reubens and many of the impressionist painters.    Even the ancient Druid Goddess and her counterparts in different parts of the world were "fat".    Dolly Parton earned her fame when she was quite "curvaceous."    you, and people like you need to get over your prejudice.|`|f81662aa70ae680b7008a9d3215b8b29aa	With the average American woman being between 5'4"-5'5" and 145 (yes, one hundred and forty five) pounds, none of the skinny models represent real women.     America, (I forget her last name) who is in that movie, is actually a typically sized woman of color and she isn't really fat. She's "fat" to you because you are used to seeing women on the screen who are maybe pushing 110lbs. at the most. I imagine, by looking at her, that she isn't a pound over 160, which wouldn't make her that much bigger than most women you see who are fairly healthy.|`|8af1a619a3526aff6bb54757e7ebbd58aa	I don't know but that phrase pisses me off. I am genetically small and slim and thus, not extremely curvy. But I am a real woman and I haven't heard any complaints from my husband. The curves I do have are the genuine thing, too, I don't have any synthetic parts.|`|AA11429012	It's obvious you are a pedophile who likes the bodies of twelve year old boys, because that's what a woman without curves is likely to look like.  Curves do not mean fat. Breast and bottoms are curves. bellies hanging and love handles are fat.|`|b7eecc1450b93a20955f4befda04bc96aa	I think it coes from those horribly skinny models,who're forced to be "boyish",and know that when they are finally connected with themsselves,they'll be a real woman and allow the "curves to surface".Until then they can only hope to one day grow into the Female!|`|5e3380cf115eae762186759e7f349072aa	The only way you don't have curves is if your shaped like a boy.It is called curves which has nothing to do with being fat.On the other hand if the saying was real women have fat rolls then that would probably be something fat chicks tell them self to feel good.The curves is what makes women's bodies so beautiful.|`|AA11618585	Hahahahaha, so true!  Other euphemisms include "healthy" or "normal".  Anyone who weighs any less than they do is accused of being "anorexic".     Another idea that's prevalent is that it's sexy to have a big butt, no matter how big they are.  Like they said in Barbershop, "There's a difference between a woman with a big @ss and a big @ss woman!"|`|AA11916638	I prefer to think of myself as "Reubenesque." Sounds classy, don't you think?     Actually, most men I've asked say that rail thin, heroine addicted looking women are not in the least attractive to them. Having a little bit of shape...breasts, bottoms...is what differentiates us from men! They want to feel like they're holding a woman, not another man!

Revelation 20: 13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.Revelation 20: 14 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire.

True, I could understand why, as there are a lot of supremely unintelligent people here, but there's also a lot of brilliant people.        Many of these people are smarter in one regard, and bad at other things. Perhaps its because we're such a large population that there are very large amounts of unintelligent folks as well as smart people, but unfortunately there's a lot of users who can't (or won't) spell who ask stupid questions, perhaps because they have nothing better to do.       With so many millions of people living here, it makes sense more of them flood this service with stupid questions and answers.     Although I'd like to point out that I don't think IQ has anything to do with it; one user said that our adults have the same IQ as British schoolchildren, but IQ doesn't change with age. you have the same IQ when your ten as when you're sixty. Also IQ is only one measure of intelligence, and it neglects a lot of things. My brother's IQ is in the 130's, but since he's very dyslexic, his scores on tests are often abysmal. It's completely unfair, but he has to deal with it.    OK, sorry about the ranting, but its what I think!|`|d61dc4df1621fc577083a9f899ca5f7daa	I don't think the Brits think you're stupid, just different. For an English speaking nation a lot of words are spelled differently  here & hundreds of expressions mean something completely different. (I know:I've been made fun of here!)  Something to note though, the Brits start school earlier & at 16 are @ the same level as an 18 year old American. School hours are longer & vacations shorter.   American kids are falling behind a lot of other countries in education, not just England.|`|fd9ae9ce94db33af7591d24b07d343d1aa	Now personally, I don't like your country, and I am trying hard to keep my personal opinions down and keep to the facts, but I do know about the general perceptions of your country.    Y'know, this is odd. We call the Irish stupid all the time, but we don't mean it, it's just a light-hearted joke. On the other hand, that Americans are stupid is a very widely held stereotype, and most people do mean it when they say it, more so than when blonds are called stupid for instance.    I think it's because there is a general distaste for America as a whole; of course no one would ever go straight up to an American and blame them for being American unless they didn't like the bugger, but on the internet this seems to be different. People don't seem to be afraid to voice their opinions as it isn't to the peoples faces, and it doesn't seem like you're being offensive. Because of this I think we are more likely to laugh at you for our perceived stereotypes.    Of course there are some very intelligent people in the USA, but then we here statistics like the number of people each year killed by having coke machines fall on top of them. Also they generally don't always get the subtleties of our sense of humour, which is different to yours, and for a Brit to not get those subtleties would be perceived as stupid.    Also, to many peoples ears, some American accents sound really slow and patronising for no reason; others like Redneck, just sound stupid. I also think we're more prepare to laugh at you for this because of the fact that every single British person on American TV speaks with a very posh accent that no one, bar maybe the royals, ever uses in real life. That is irritating to the max.    It's just a stereotype, maybe there are more stupid Americans, I don't have the figures, but I wouldn't worry about it. I found out you have a stereotype that we have bad teeth; now this isn't true, we have dental care covered partially on the NHS, but it's the other way round then.|`|AA10401313	To countries divided by a common language.|`|e7267b03a779b83f1c7d1274696ab0fcaa	It's because they feel superior to us.

4db07412ef2c09f8393cb86bf7e153deaa	You're assuming that theists did not come to their beliefs through any kind of rational means.  Even speaking as an atheist, I would disagree with that.  People who believe that God at the very least exists, invariably do so because that IS the conclusion that they've come to, based on their own share of philosophical thinking and personal experiences.

Show some respect and tolerance, otherwise you make yourself look pompous and obnoxious.|`|AA11707311	I've never been superstitious in my life.<br>  Acknowledging God is the end of superstition.|`|WJD3bVH0aa	No common thing we know of exists without a creator, even if the creator is unknown. For instance, when you look at a building, you know somebody created it, even if you don't know who. So why would it be impossible to accept that there is a creator for everything else - the birds, the trees, the rivers, us?<br>  <br>  And when atheists say, "There is no God", they are actually deeming that they know all knowledge about everything in the universe. By making such a statement, they must really believe that they can prove there is no Creator, and there is no possibility otherwise.<br>  <br>  For those who believe everything on the earth was created by chance - "the big bang theory" - are taking a huge risk putting their faith in science. The big bang theory is, itself, just a theory - a probability of something that could have happened. But people often misconstrue all of science for fact, which isn't true. Think of everything scientists keep telling us throughout the years... one test proves that something is good for us, another test proves that it's dangerous. It's a constant back-and-forth of trying to find "truth".<br>  <br>  To me, it is more rational that there is a God. But beyond the simple proof of a Creator, God continues to speak to us and work in people's lives. He has even given us the Bible (His word), which in itself has an astounding amount of proof for today's intellect. There are more original copies of the books of the Bible than any other book, and the copies we have are within decades of when Jesus was alive, which can't be said for any other book. The Bible itself is also full of prophecy that has not only been fulfilled within the book, but been fulfilled around us.<br>  <br>  Jesus said: "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me." (John 14:6)<br>  <br>  Jesus is the only truth, and the only key to eternal life. Although people like to pretend there is no heaven and hell, when they die and find out firsthand they're real, it will be too late for them.|`|wYgWaIeRaa	If atheists were more rational, would they see non belief as irrational and illogical.  <br>  <br>  Wisdom reposes in the heart of the discerning and even among fools she lets herself be known.|`|TXKWqmVGaa	You are assuming that a Theist is not rational or even logical when it comes to their particular belief.  Just goes to show the lack of logic on your part.|`|lhY1XDKlaa	Having a  concept of reason has led me to being a theist. 
d82fcb6de9ce28d93513b91d4bdf93b2aa	Psychics come in two kinds: those who are just too insensitive to the world to notice their lack of ability, and those who are deliberate frauds.

I see for your future a brown car, and outstepping an average man, wearing...a white shirt.|`|AA10091182	Anita - No psychic can help you because there is no such thing as psychics.  What you will encounter are people who have read a book on cold reading - the skill of making a lot of guesses, getting your "client" to confirm and guide you and leaving the person with the impression that you thought of it all yourself.  Even worse is "hot reading" where they research you first (even go through your purse) to get information that they then feed back to you.    James Randi offers one million dollars to any psychic who can demonstrate the power he or she claims.  That's all they have to do:  Do the thing they say they can.  Not a single well-known psychic has accepted and not a single psychic has ever even passed a preliminary stage.      Please do not waste time and energy on this nonsense.  If you need to speak to someone, go to a trained therapist.    Edit:  The person above me demonstrates cold reading by making lots of guesses that really could be true of anybody.  Everyone, after all, has stress at work.  (In fairness, the poster above is doing it as a joke as the last line indicates.)|`|AA11684190	I do not believe the psychic can help, they listen only.  Being strangers makes it easy for a person to pour out their hearts to them.  Let's say you are living with someone treating you bad, how can the psychis do about it? tell you to leave? no point in visiting them.  I hope you have a friend you can trust to tell everything.  Psychics are for one with mental disorders but who cannot admit it.

AA10571513	What a ridiculous thing to say. Sure, that may be what the term Jehad means, but Jihad is something much different.

Any struggle done in day-to-day life to please God can be considered Jihad. One of the highest levels of Jihad is to stand up to a tyrant and speak a word of truth. Control of the self from wrong doings is also a great Jihad. One of the forms of Jihad is to take up arms in defense of Islam or a Muslim country when Islam is attacked. This kind of Jihad has to be declared by the religious leadership or by a Muslim head of state who is following the Quran and Sunnah.|`|AA11317725	Jihad means: dying for your cause.|`|b1f9db37caaf6278c9ff9a7f8f8b5e16aa	Jehad my noonie.

He's saying that God wants His children to stop fighting and is working hard for world peace, currently working to make peace in the Middle East.  Having rabi's crown Jesus as king and Messiah sounds like a pretty good thing to me.    Plus, what some of you guys are saying is practically hypocritical.

Crabs can detect and distinguish the pee from other crabs.  Dogs can sense who recently left a room, just by the smell.  <br>  Personally, I know of at least three senses beyond the five of which you are aware.  They allow me to "see" more than you can, and experience a reality you may never know.  We are all born with senses that require development, and these senses often remain undeveloped in people.  Those who use these senses, know of which I talk.  Everyone else probably thinks I am making it up.  These additional senses only come with spiritual growth.

WJD3bVH0aa	Why can't you do both? I study Asian languages, and I'm learning Chinese and Korean at the same time right now. In the least, perhaps you could start learning a little about both languages - the grammar, basic vocab (hello/goodbye/etc), verb cases, etc... that way, you can get a feel for both and decide which one you want to focus on (if you only want to focus on one).<br>  <br>  You also might want to think about what you plan to do with your skills. Do you want a career translating in one of the languages? Or do you want to visit or live in one of the countries? These are the things I thought about before getting seriously involved with studying foreign languages.<br>  <br>  Swedish was a language I always wanted to study a little, but I still haven't. Russian, on the other hand, I got into a bit. I wouldn't say it's hard, especially not if you're familiar with cases from knowing German. But it IS a lot of fun. The alphabet was very easy to learn, and if I forget everything else I know about the language, at least I like to read it and pronounce the words.<br>  <br>  Best wishes!

Then, in verse 8, God says: ' You must not eat their meat or touch their carcasses; they are unclean for you'. This command is repeated in Deuteronomy 14;7-8. Then, in Isaiah 65:2-4, and 66:17, God issues a stern warning against those who eat pork.    Christians do anyways?    It's the same thing. You either follow the Quran or you don't.

Such is the Law.    This is also in the Law:  Leviticus 19:23  And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you: it shall not be eaten of.  24  But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise the LORD withal.  25  And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I am the LORD your God.    Have you ever eaten fruit that was uncircumcised? If you have, you have failed to accomplish the Law. You are condemned if you have let yourself do this, knowingly or not.     An this:  Exodus 13:13  And every firstling of an *** thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.    If you are under the Law, you are to uphold all of it, or you will be condemned.

Through the universal law of attraction, the vibrations (via our conscious or unconscious beliefs, thoughts, emotions, words, actions) that we put into the world, and whether they are positive or negative, love-based or fear-based, lead to the events that we experience in return, in one form or another.

By "keys" is signified the power of opening and shutting; here the power of opening hell, that man may be brought forth, and of shutting, lest, when he is brought forth, he should enter again. For man is born in evils of all kinds, thus in hell, for evils are hell; he is brought out of it by the Lord, to whom belongs the power of opening it. That by "having the keys of hell and death," is not meant the power of casting into hell, but the power of saving, is because it immediately follows after these words:     Behold, I am alive for ages of ages;     by which is signified that He alone is eternal life (n. 60); and the Lord never casts anyone into hell, but man casts himself. By "keys" is signified the power of opening and shutting, in Revelation also (3:7; 9:1; 20:1; also in Isa. 22:21, 22; in Matt. 16:19; and in Luke 11:52). The power of the Lord is not only over heaven, but also over hell; for hell is kept in order and connection by oppositions against heaven; for which reason, He who rules the one must necessarily rule the other; otherwise man could not be saved; to be saved is to be brought out of hell" (Apocalypse Revealed n. 62).      http://www.mechanicsburgnewchurch.org|`|5cb5cb07aa8cede5729a8b8e076a58caaa	okay instead of praying nonstop how about seek medical help.

Christianity says you'll go to Hell, if for nothing less than thinking evil thoughts.    I wouldn't concern myself with Hell right now. The real problem seems to be that you're angry and lashing out. You shouldn't try to cure this because you might go to Hell. You should try to cure yourself because you feel bad about it and it's destructive to you.     It sounds like you're getting caught up in your own emotions. The next time it happens, take a deep breath and ask yourself if what you're angry about is truly worth it. Will you be angry tomorrow? How about next week? Chances are, it's not really that bad.

With out my even trying sometimes HE changes me.  Because with Him I am different, no longer what I was before, but new.      God more than anything has shown me He is real by showing me His love.  I used to think God was mad all the time at me, and I had to be perfect or do everything right and He would just send something terrible to happen to me.  I used to love Him because I had to or He'd get mad and something bad would happen to me if He got mad.  But one night I told Him that, with just a little fear.  And I told Him I wanted to love Him the right way and He has been showing me how ever since.  I really love Him now, just for who He is.  Because He loves me inspite of how terrible I am.  He's the only one who knows EVERYTHING about me and He is still on my side and with me everyday.   He is not expecting a perfect performance from me, for me to follow the Bible to the letter, but He sees my heart is right toward Him.  He knows I can't be perfect, duh, that is why He sent Jesus.  He just wants me to trust Him and lean on Him.  And as I do, I do see the changes, slowly but surely.  That is how I know.  Because I know who I was then and who I am now, because of Him.|`|7736d3ff5bb1a877a6df2c9bbcd87ad1aa	Many philosophers have attempted to demonstrate a "proof for the existence of God" throughout the centuries. Some of them are better than others, however, most are ambiguous.     The 10th century philosopher Anselm of Canterbury presented what became known as the "Ontological Argument". This consisted of the following, (condensed):    -God, if he exists, is that than which no greater can be conceived.  -God can be conceived in the mind to exist.  -To exist is reality is greater than just existing in the mind.  Conclusion: God must exist in reality as well as in the mind    This argument is better understood within its context, and so I would suggest reading Anselm's Proslogion, of which the "ontological argument" only consumes a few pages.    Descartes, the ultimate skeptic, attempted to contemplate whether or not God existed, and what exactly he was capable of 'knowing.' He ultimately concluded, "I think, therefore I am." His logic followed that truths had to come from an ultimate source, and his existence could not have been the birth of his own thought. However, he also offered a more extensive proof based on several different approaches.    Kierkegaard concluded that there was no way to prove the existence of God, but that he must exist, and thus it requires a "leap of faith" to accept this truth.    In the end, there is no way to undeniably prove God's existence, otherwise everyone would believe. The most compelling argument for me comes from Thomas Aquinas who offered the following "five ways" to the existence of God. Again, these are condensed, and I recommend reading an excerpt from his Summa Theologica:    1. First mover - everything moves as a reaction of having been moved by something else, therefore there had to be a "first mover"    2. First efficient cause - there is a cause for every effect, therefore, if we traced back each effect, and its cause, it would require that the first effect would require an efficient cause    3. Everything is created by something else (you by your parents, etc), but if we traced this back to infinity it would require that there has to be the existence of some being having of itself its own necessity, and not receiving it from another, but rather causing in others their necessity.    4. There must be something by which all beings and things derive their perfections, maxims, and understanding of truth.    5. The universe acts in an intelligent manner. Things that lack reason act intelligibly (plants move toward sunlight, etc). Therefore, some intelligent being exists by whom all natural things are directed to their end.    All of these five things we call God.      I hope this helps answer your question. I find Aquinas to be the most effective in making a reasonable and intelligible argument.

Have you ever tried rebelling just for the sake of rebellion?  Because if you haven't, your freedom to rebel may already have been taken from you.

Now if you dont believe what those who lived in Jesus' day said that there are a multitude of ways to show the uniqueness, inerrancy, historical reliability, prophetic reliability, and scientific truth of the Bible.        Ignorance presupposes lies for the truth.

But the concepts do.    .........................................    I. The Scriptures    The Holy Bible was written by men divinely inspired and is God's revelation of Himself to man. It is a perfect treasure of divine instruction. It has God for its author, salvation for its end, and truth, without any mixture of error, for its matter. Therefore, all Scripture is totally true and trustworthy. It reveals the principles by which God judges us, and therefore is, and will remain to the end of the world, the true center of Christian union, and the supreme standard by which all human conduct, creeds, and religious opinions should be tried. All Scripture is a testimony to Christ, who is Himself the focus of divine revelation.     Exodus 24:4; Deuteronomy 4:1-2; 17:19; Joshua 8:34; Psalms 19:7-10; 119:11,89,105,140; Isaiah 34:16; 40:8; Jeremiah 15:16; 36:1-32; Matthew 5:17-18; 22:29; Luke 21:33; 24:44-46; John 5:39; 16:13-15; 17:17; Acts 2:16ff.; 17:11; Romans 15:4; 16:25-26; 2 Timothy 3:15-17; Hebrews 1:1-2; 4:12; 1 Peter 1:25; 2 Peter 1:19-21.|`|AA12059450	2Timothy 3:16 God has breathed life into all of Scripture. It is useful for teaching us what is true. It is useful for correcting our mistakes. It is useful for making our lives whole again. It is useful for training us to do what is right.    "Theopneustos kai ophelimos" or "God-breathed and profitable or useful" indicates the nature of scripture.|`|408c74f3274a6d67e733704cde86c921aa	I'm sorry there is no book VCR 12:00 in the bible.|`|cd946044f0431e15f42c3cc6ab2443a9aa	If you have actually read the bible it is quite obvious that Jesus was closest to Peter.    This actualyl climaxed with Peter recieving the keys to heaven from christ himself.    It does not say infallible but it does say "what you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and what you loose on earth shall be loosed on earth."    Sounds like what he says means what you say goes...    Could it be any clearer?    LOVE YA!|`|AA10241705	That's actually pretty funny. Good for you. Anyway - have you ever picked up the Bible and read it? Have you studied it? It's really the only way to make an informed decision, don't you think? If you've never read it, your opinion means nothing. If you have read it, you'd know the answer to your question. It's nice to know you have nothing better to do with your time than be a troll and try to piss people off. Your parents must be so proud. But you know what? I forgive you, and I pray that God blesses you with every happiness. Peace to you.|`|239f0ef98b65c819dacad5a9908c975aaa	Not in the Bible. It comes from Oral Tradition which is actually older than the Bible and where the Bible developed from.    Remember, Jesus taught a lot and preached a lot. John even said if everything Jesus did and said were written in books there wouldn't be enough room in the whole world to put them. With that said...Jesus never wrote a book. It was all oral.|`|AA11476749	No, it's not VCR 12:00.  That's why you need an instruction manual, so you can program the silly thing!    It's also not in II Opinions 13:31, nor Hezekiah 13:13.    It is found in II Timothy 3:16-17, "All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be complete and thoroughly equipped for every good work."    The word translated "God-breathed," is the Greek word "Theopneustos," which literally means God-breathed.  We see in other passages, that God cannot lie (Cf. Titus 1:1-2), and that God's Word will endure forever (Cf. Matthew 5:18), it will also achieve exactly what God desires (Isaiah 55:10-11)    Those are just a few of the areas where we get the concept of God's Word being inerrant and infallible.  Hope that helps.

Some of your facts seem to be a little "off", can you learn from those who have gone before you?  Check out this link, some interesting truths are there.    Christianity is a monotheistic[1] religion centered on the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth as recounted in the Gospels.[2] Christians believe Jesus to be the Messiah, and thus refer to him as Jesus Christ. With an estimated 2.1 billion adherents in 2001, Christianity is the world's largest religion.[3] It is the predominant religion in the Americas, Europe, Oceania, and large parts of Africa.    Christianity began in the 1st century AD as a Jewish sect[4], and therefore shares many religious texts and early history with Judaism  specifically, the Hebrew Bible, which Christians call the Old Testament (see Judeo-Christian). Like Judaism and Islam, Christianity is considered an Abrahamic religion.    In the New Testament, the term "Christian" first appears in Acts 11:26: "The disciples were called Christians first at Antioch."

If you missed Mass on Sunday you are in mortal sin and should not receive. If you voted for a pro-choice candidate, or if you are pro-choice, you are in mortal sin and should not receive. <br>  <br>  The Eucharist is not a right, but a sacrament and a blessing. It is the Body and Blood of Christ, wholly present. The Bible (St. Paul) says "he who receives unworthily, failing to discern the Body and Blood of Christ, calls judgment down on himself. He is guilty of profaning (murdering) the Body and Blood of Christ." These are very serious words. The priests and the Church have a responsibility to let the faithful know the danger they may be putting themselves in. <br>  <br>  Any Catholic who votes pro-choice endangers their souls and the priest needs to warn them. That is his job, and thankfully some are actually not afraid to do their job.<br>  <br>  If you call yourself a Catholic, go up to receive our Lord each week, then you are professing that you believe in the Real Presence of Christ and in the authority of the Church. You are claiming to be in communion with God and the Church. If you are not, then you need to not receive. If you do not understand this then you need to pray and ask God to help you understand, not get all prideful and stand up in Church and march out. You basically say to God "not your will, but mine." <br>  <br>  Jesus commissioned Peter to do three things – feed my lambs, tend my sheep, and feed my sheep. Any priest who understands these words would be remiss if he didn't let Christ's flock know when they are in danger. That is what he is doing. As a Catholic you should accept this from your priest, and not assert your own pride as the guide of your conscience. The Holy Spirit should guide you and you need to get your pride out of the way and allow God to speak to you through his ordained priest. |`|sQsl1r5Yaa	Sorry, not any church or anything else would separate from the love of Christ since I agree with Paul who wrote in Romans Chapter 8<br>  <br>  35Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?

Only faith alone in JESUS as Savior, saves. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross and rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|AA12194228	If you can let the opinions of people take your faith from you, it was not true faith anyway.

The Church is right.<br>  Obama's stance on abortion makes him incompatable with proper Catholic voters.<br>  <br>  From the Catechism:<br>  <br>  2271 Since the first century the Church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion. This teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable. Direct abortion, that is to say, abortion willed either as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law: <br>  <br>  You shall not kill the embryo by abortion and shall not cause the newborn to perish. <br>  <br>  God, the Lord of life, has entrusted to men the noble mission of safeguarding life, and men must carry it out in a manner worthy of themselves. Life must be protected with the utmost care from the moment of conception: abortion and infanticide are abominable crimes. <br>  <br>  2272 Formal cooperation in an abortion constitutes a grave offense. The Church attaches the canonical penalty of excommunication to this crime against human life. "A person who procures a completed abortion incurs excommunication latae sententiae," "by the very commission of the offense," and subject to the conditions provided by Canon Law. The Church does not thereby intend to restrict the scope of mercy. Rather, she makes clear the gravity of the crime committed, the irreparable harm done to the innocent who is put to death, as well as to the parents and the whole of society. <br>  <br>  2322 From its conception, the child has the right to life. Direct abortion, that is, abortion willed as an end or as a means, is a "criminal" practice (GS 27 § 3), gravely contrary to the moral law. The Church imposes the canonical penalty of excommunication for this crime against human life.<br>   <br>  2274 Since it must be treated from conception as a person, the embryo must be defended in its integrity, cared for, and healed, as far as possible, like any other human being. <br>  <br>  Prenatal diagnosis is morally licit, "if it respects the life and integrity of the embryo and the human fetus and is directed toward its safe guarding or healing as an individual. . . . It is gravely opposed to the moral law when this is done with the thought of possibly inducing an abortion, depending upon the results: a diagnosis must not be the equivalent of a death sentence."

AA10020540	You don't have to be related to anyone in order to convert. It's not surprising you have felt an urge to convert and an ancestor that was Jewish. This happens all the time.<br>  <br>  What type of Judaism you convert to will depend on what's available near you. <br>  <br>  Converting is a long process for most people and sometimes frustrating. A key to success is to just enjoy the process which is different for everyone. <br>  <br>  I'd start by going to a synagogue near you and talking to the Rabbi. You will likely know if you have a Jewish soul during the first service you attend.<br>  <br>  When you convert, you are fully Jewish. Even during the process you are considered a part of the tribe. <br>  <br>  A word of caution: I haven't seen it in Yahoo answers, but there are people on paltalk who will greatly discourage you. Many of these people are converts themselves and really don't have an understanding of Judaism or the conversion process. I suggest you ignore these people.|`|J3CloKpAaa	it's a beautiful thing u believe in your 1Creator & dont ascribe partnership onto him.<br>  <br>  ok, have u really analyzed scripture to scripture.<br>  <br>  nabi (prophet) Musa (Moses) alayhi salaam (peace be upon him) original message has been corrupted by evil-livers.<br>  <br>  heres examples, i got alot.<br>  <br>  according to Gen. 16:16 Abraham alayhi salaam (peace be upon him) was 86 years old when Ishmael alayhi salaam was born. And according to Gen. 21:5 Abraham was 100, Ishmael 14, when Isaac alayhi salaam was born.<br>  <br>  According to Gen. 21:8-19 the “mocking” incident took place after Isaac alayhi salaam was weaned. Biblical scholars tell us the child was probably weaned at about the age of three. Ishmael was 17.<br>  <br>  Thus, it follows that when Hajira radi Allahu ana (may Allah be pleased with her) & Ishmael alayhi salaam were taken away. Ishmael alayhi salaam was a full-grown teenager, 17 years old. However, the profiles of Ishmael alayhi salaam in Gen 21:14-19 is a small baby & not a full-grown teenager. Why?<br>  <br>  TRUTH is Ismael alayhi salaam left with his mom Hajira when he was a baby. that part of Ismael alayhi salaam "mocking" his brother Is'haq`alayhi salaam was created by evil-doers/jews to favour their nation.<br>  <br>  in "attempting" to create false info they made errors. if he was 17 according to bible, how could he cry & his mother place him under a bush? evil-doers/jews called him a "wicked man". one whos named in the bible "God hears"? sinful is what they feed their bellies.<br>  <br>  Genesis 41:17 states: And Pharaoh said unto Joseph In my dream behold I stood upon the bank of the river<br>  <br>  they use the word Par`oh (par-o')<br>  Paroh, a general title of Egyptian kings -- Pharaoh.<br>  <br>  During nabi (prophet) Joseph's alayhi salaam (peace be upon him) life period (The Middle Kingdom Egypt, the 11th Dynasty to the end of the 14th Dynasty, between 2040 BC and 1640 BC), "pharaoh" meant "great house", name referred to the "palace" not the king's/ruler's title.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_(Heb..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_(Heb...</a><br>  <br>  what is pharaoh mean?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharaoh" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharaoh</a> (read start until u finish Etymology)<br>  <a href="http://www.touregypt.net/kings.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.touregypt.net/kings.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://i-cias.com/e.o/pharaoh.htm" rel="nofollow">http://i-cias.com/e.o/pharaoh.htm</a><br>  <br>  Did the palace/great house say to Joseph alayhi salaam, "in my dream"?<br>  <br>  How did nabi Muhammad sallallahu alayhi wa salaam, state accurate claims in the Qur'an?<br>  <br>  He was illiterate, a merchant, no expertise, knowledge, research (scientific) of ancient egypt.<br>  <br>  Your 1Lord is All-Knowing.<br>  <br>  The Qur'an from our 1All-Wise Creator states: surah (chapter) Yusuf (12:23) : Waqala almaliku innee ara .

God created everything in existence which means that he therefore created sin and made it apart of our lives.  God denounces murder in the bible the 10 commandments says thou shalt not kill, and what does god do? He sends his only son to earth do be murdered by those people who are suppose to be following his written word and law?<br>  Everyone needs something to believe in and the fact that accepting jesus as  your savior is a ticket into heaven works for most people, but you can't just go to church and accept him in your heart without doing something yourself to assure the fact that your going to heaven.  <br>  It is the belief  that he will save us, that is installed in everyone instead of the thought that we can do it ourselves.<br>   God loves us all no matter what, and if he wants us to go to heaven, we will no matter what we have done, in the end he will forgive us.|`|UHfA9yHPaa	Well, Christians are probably worried about going to Hell and want to save themselves from that.<br>  <br>  Plus everybody sins, Christian or not, so they're worried about their own sins.<br>  <br>  It's a sad thing. I wish I could depend on some guy to fix all my problems for me, but I'm too realistic and I know I have to solve my problems by myself.|`|WeUfJgv2aa	Ephesians: 2:1-8<br>   As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins, in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient. All of us also lived among them at one time, gratifying the cravings of our sinful nature[a] and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature objects of wrath. But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you have been saved. And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus, in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace, expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus. For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God|`|554de7bde05b61a0218c1da92faa6040aa	Jesus was sent into the world to save us from our sins.

I really think you'll appreciate it.<br>  <br>  One tiny but important misconception to clear up... You said, "People have always done bad things."  Very true.  However, people have not always "sinned" or done "evil" things.  <br>  <br>  It all goes back to the story of Adam and Eve.  In Christian mythology, Adam and Eve were perfect before Original Sin and the Fall and their expulsion from the garden when they became faulty sinners punished forever to work the land.  No longer did they live within the hand of the gods because they took for themselves the knowledge of the goods, the knowledge of good and evil.  Now that we were fatally flawed we needed help to get back with God.  We needed salvation.  Jesus saves us from sin.. not the bad things we do, but SIN.  Sin, and EVIL.  <br>  <br>  This is what people like texasdolly are talking about.  But what does texasdolly really mean?  <br>  <br>  To figure it out, we have to take a nice hard look at the story of the Fall of Adam and Eve.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Allf_ZAH.WGDX8FmFImpZrzty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20070423151857AAYpYDM">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  So rather than being a story about the creation of humanity, the story is about the creation of civilization, god, and absolute morality.  There was no such thing as "sin" before we came up with the idea of god.  We began to see ourselves as being flawed, and why not?  We became spiritually shallow and destructive and we worked at least twice as hard as we did when we were hunter-gatherers.  We were no longer living in accordance with the laws of nature.  Since we were so fatally flawed, and sinners no less, we needed religion to tell us we were doing the right thing and we had a chance.  We needed a saviour.  We needed eternal life in glorious heaven, because life on earth became endless work.  <br>  <br>  Many of us who have come to the realization there probably isn't a god (and perhaps definitely not the Christian god) realize there is no absolute morality.  There is no good and evil.  We are not fatally flawed and there is no such thing as perfection.  There is nothing at all that we need salvation from.  You do not need to be saved!|`|UvlfP3r0aa	If you ask for forgiveness, you'll be saved from hell. <br>  <br>  It's your belief though..|`|CbL4ybdLaa	I've wondered the very same thing.|`|PhdQR88Paa	jesus is saving us hell|`|H7L66ynJaa	No one except God can forgive sins.

It is not real compared to the way that God lives.  He made us to live and enjoy it with Him, but our father Adam chose to go the opposite way.  Fortunately, our Older Brother made a way for us to come back.  That is what His "saving" did for us.  We would not forgive ourselves if left alone, we like this temporary life because we don't know anything else.  This world is unfair and has more downs than ups, but then, that is the lesson we are to learn and when we do, we yearn for something better.  Thanks goodness, there is.  Thanks for asking.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	You are responsible. There is a Hell. And a reasonable, moral person would seek to know whether there is a God, what He requires, what He has revealed. <br>  <br>  <br>  Anyway, you assume that this is in fact the best it gets, that there never was nor ever will be a better. You are wrong. But you are responsible for being wrong.|`|A01w1dHqaa	It is the part of us that does forgive that is the Christ.<br>  <br>  As we follow in his footsteps our lives change. That's how he saves, by us showing who he and we are.<br>  <br>  We are not our bodies, we are mind and all of mind is connected. What he said about himself is true of you.<br>  <br>  Ther are only two ways we can be. The ego never forgives, but condemns and tries to separate. The Christ Self knows that we know not what we do, so we must be forgiven for all of us to be happy and loving. Being the Christ we are saved from thinking we are  the ego.|`|25qUTYLEaa	All I know is that I'm an addict, and I struggle with it every day.

As for the rest of the world, no we cannot, which is why we need Jesus.|`|ij5Sv6staa	Yes, you can forgive others, but you cannot forgive yourself for what you do to others, only they can forgive you.  This also applies to God, and your sin of rejecting him.  God is the Almighty Creator of you, rejecting him is no trivial matter, and to just say forget about it trivializes the offense and therefore trivializes the Almighty God.<br>  <br>  ALL have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. Even one sin has stained our soul and creates a chasm between that person and God. God is holy and perfect, and from his perspective we are ALL unworthy, from Mother Theresa to Hitler.<br>  <br>  God loves you more than you love yourself. God loves us more than you can imagine and God wants to be with us. But because God is holy, we cannot be in his presence with the stain of sin upon our souls.<br>  <br>  So God, the Almighty Creator, took human form as Jesus and permitted himself to be tortured and killed as an innocent blood offering to erase the stain of sin on our souls. He loves you this much. This act by a loving God bridged the chasm between us and him. God, through Jesus, bore the punishment that was due to us for our disobedience from God. To ignore the sin, is to trivialize the offense, and therefore trivialize God. Our sin is a great offense, which required a great punishment. God loves you so much, that he bore this punishment for you. NONE of us are worthy of this gift, but God offers it through his grace. All you have to do is accept it. It is his free gift to you because he loves YOU.<br>  <br>  Salvation is a free gift of God, which requires that we give nothing in return. We need only "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved..." (Acts 16:31). <br>  <br>  Eternal life is a "free gift" (Romans 5:15-21; 6:23), which cannot be merited by good works, or lost by bad works. <br>  <br>  Imagine if you were convicted of murder, and were sentenced to die by execution, and the son of the person you murdered came and volunteered to take your place, be executed instead of you, and you were set free. That is what God did for you because he loves you more than you can imagine.<br>  <br>  John 15:13<br>  Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.|`|v6nISGeUaa	You don't understand sin. If you did, you would know that we cannot forgive ourselves and then enter Heaven. To us, God is not an illusion, but the maker of all things. To enter Heaven, we must believe in Him and know that we are stained with sin. Our salvation is through Jesus.<br>  <br>  Psalms 10:3,4<br>  The wicked even boast of their greed; these robbers curse and scorn the Lord. In their insolence the wicked boast: "God doesn't care, doesn't even exist." <br>  <br>  .|`|HmPpgzeqaa	People can not overcome death,<br>  and avoid the depths of hell<br>  without faith in Jesus.<br>  <br>  Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life.

rwBQXCQ8aa	Hey, I think I might be able to answer your question, at least to some degree.  I'm not an expert on Finnish, or a linguist, and certainly not a native speaker, but have studied Finnish for a little over a year. I'll try to be as eloquent as I can in my explanation, but please excuse me if I am redundant or don't make a lot of sense, it is a hard topic to explain, especially when you aren't a teacher.  <br>  <br>  The partitive singular case is used to express "partial" quantity of something, and also used to specifically express numbers of things.  <br>  <br>  The best example I can give as to expressing partial quantities of things would be with "paljon" (a lot).  For example, "paljon riisi?"(a lot of rice).  Though this may sound kind of like plural in English, it isn't.  The analogy my Finnish teacher uses is to differentiate between "scoopable" and "unscoopable" nouns.  "Scoopable" nouns are those that are typically referred to in mass quantities, for example "kahvi"(coffee), "jogurtti"(yogurt), "riisi"(rice), or "j??tel?"(ice cream).  As an example, you don't typically eat "a yogurt"(unless you're talking about an individual yogurt cup or something).  Rather, you eat "some yogurt".  Where "Min? sy?n jogurtti" (lit. I eat a/the yogurt) doesn't really make a whole lot of sense, "Min? sy?n jogurttia"(I eat some yogurt) makes perfect sense.  You could also think of the partitive as "I eat of the yogurt".   <br>  <br>  In contrast, "unscoopable" nouns are those that are often thought of as individual items...unlike a bunch of rice or coffee or gasoline...think of things like trees or cats or cars or dogs.  The partitive singular does not apply in the same way to these types of nouns, for example "paljon koiraa" (a lot of dog) does not make sense (unless you're talking about parts of one dog, like meat or something...gross, ha ha).  Rather, the partitive plural needs to be used in this instance..."paljon koiria" (a lot of dogs).  I'm not sure if you know how to form the partitive plural, but it is a different story altogether.<br>  <br>  With unscoopable nouns, the partitive singular is used to express specific numbers of these unscoopable items.  In fact, as far as I know, you ALWAYS use the partitive singular when talking about numbers of things (unless there is only one, in which case you use the nominative case).  For example, "Yksi koira"(notice nominative case), "kaksi koiraa"(now we're using partitive), "Kolme koiraa", "sataa koiraa", "tuhatta koiraa".  Again, I'd like to point out that "kolme koiraa" is not plural, it literally means "Three of (the category) dog".<br>  <br>  So in summary, the partitive singular is used when talking about "some amount" of something (specifically, "scoopable" nouns)..."v?h?n puuroa" ( a little bit of cereal), "Min? join maitoa" (I drank some milk).<br>  <br>  And then the other use of the partitive singular is when expressing numbers..."Puistossa on 6 puuta" (in the park are 6 trees), "Viisi munaa" (five eggs)...or "6 of tree" and "Five of egg".  <br>  <br>  Did that make ANY sense at all?!

And another thing, I do my best to keep my humor.|`|764b0a2542a042d446e82dc85deb410faa	My 11 year old daughter. Who needs me. And plus the fact if I do not get better and I do die. No matter what pre arrangments I have made or set up legally for my daughter mean nothing. Then her father will decide he wants her after 11 years so he can collect the social security that my daughter would get because I have died. He would do it for the monthly payment. Right now he pays 12 dollars  a month. Good news it went up a dollar this years. So now I am at 12 dollars. Also I pray that I get well. Just the thought of my daughters father cashing that social security check each month give me more reason to fight. Yes I love my daughter and I want to get better so I can be there for her. I do not want her to have to  suffer living with her father. I have checked into it legally and since he is the father if I am to die he gets custody of our daughter if he chooses. Even though he was not there when she born. He has never once chosen to be in her life.  The reason he pays so little child support is because I make more then him. They have to allow him and his wife and her kids enough money to live on. And since I make more then he does and he has more people to support he only has to pay 12.00. At any given time he can ask the judge for a child support hearing, and try to have that 12.00 taken of if my income is to far above his. His therory is, he never wanted a child so why should he have to pay. And NO I did not get pregnant on purpose.|`|f36a390c92c1ab09936e456ea10984f5aa	Science.

25a10833583e41e85028e6e4fd50a5f1aa	Technically, this verse is not an instance of angels carrying a soul to heaven.  This is a case of the angels carrying a soul to Paradise.  Heaven is not prepared yet, or Jesus would have come back for us.  :o)  (John 14)    I'm not sure how souls get to be with God, but I do know that in 2 Corinthians, we are told that we are either at home in the body or with the Lord, there doesn't seem to be an inbetween transit time.    2 Corinthians 5:6-9 "Therefore we are always confident and know that as long as we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord. We live by faith, not by sight. We are confident, I say, and would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord. So we make it our goal to please him, whether we are at home in the body or away from it."    So I would say this is an instance where we cannot tell from Scripture so any ideas anyone can give you are pure speculation and opinion.  We'll just have to wait and find out.  :o)|`|AA12043358	In this verse it appears that angels do carry a persons soul to heaven when they die.  I have never seen this any where else in the Bible.     I am not 100 percent sure that angels carry a persons soul to heaven when they die.  All I know is if a person has had faith in the finished work of the cross and  accepted what Jesus has done for them, then they will have eternal life in heaven!|`|AA11805224	My husband thinks so.|`|cb1de71a0673eea90521ad7afef82e20aa	sure hon believe what u want|`|AA11570293	There is nowhere in the bible that states we even have a soul!!  I will put up $10,000 cash to anyone that can prove me wrong.  According to the bible we are souls, we are not given a soul.  And we are not immortal, nor do we have any immortal soul.  So NO, I do not believe any angels carry any soul to Heaven till Jesus comes and we all go back together with Him.  Then there may be some angels carrying some souls back to Heaven but they are not some spirit but flesh and bone body.|`|8408dc6d25926f2233876053b877c8b2aa	No... not from the Christian Faith pov... but it dose sound kind of nice though doe'nt it.... maybe... why not?...

They are not wacko's, but real honest scientists, who can prove their findings as well as any scientists who don't believe in the Bible.  As to what happened to dragons and leviathans - extinction in some form, whether by nature or mankind; we all know extinction still is happening today.
6NEPcZFfaa	maybe, and your being white makes you blind to his points.<br>  <br>  what? I'm saying if you think he is only speaking through his biased views, which may be true, you being white would not fully understand where he is coming from because you can't see it from any other view but your own. You wouldn't understand it and you would think he was only using his race when he sees his race as the reason.- you could be both wrong. He could be speaking through his biases and you may not be listening through your idea that he is only complaining or "pulling the race card"..... I think its both wrong, most of the times its probably a little in the middle. I think that the way it is for most racial issues today.

Hopefully he will have the opportunity to clear the facts in a nice manner, without affecting the reputation of his father.  Ultimately what the man has is really a gift from his dad to begin with.  His life, his upbringing, his intelligence are all gifts of his father, who raised him.  Ultimately I consider everything I got to be my fathers.      If anything I feel sorry for the father, who is earning wrong to himself, as ultimately it is wrong to take what belongs to someone else.  The decent thing to do is to give in fairness.

The vision is interposed between the sounding of the sixth, or second woe-trumpet, and the sounding of the seventh, or third woe-trumpet, under which is to be the final consummation, Rev_11:15 ff. It occupies an important interval between the events which were to occur under the sixth trumpet and the last scene - the final overthrow of the formidable power which had opposed the reign of God on the earth, and the reign of righteousness, when the kingdoms of the world shall become the kingdom of God, Rev_11:15. It is, in many respects, an unhappy circumstance that this chapter has been separated from the following. They constitute one continued vision, at least to Rev_11:15, where the sounding of the seventh and last trumpet occurs.  The tenth chapter contains the following things:  (1) An angel descends from heaven, and the attention of the seer is for a time turned from the contemplation of what was passing in heaven to this new vision that appeared on the earth. This angel is clothed with a cloud; he is encircled by a rainbow; his face is as the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire - all indicating his exalted rank, and all such accompaniments as became a heavenly messenger.  (2) the angel appears with a small volume in his hand, Rev_10:2. This book is not closed and sealed, like the one in Rev_5:1-14, but was open - so that it could be read. Such a book would indicate some new message or revelation from heaven; and the book would be, properly, a symbol of something that was to be accomplished by such an open volume.  (3) the angel sets his feet upon the sea and the land, Rev_10:2 - indicating by this, apparently, that what he was to communicate pertained alike to the ocean and the land - to all the world.  (4) the angel makes a proclamation - the nature of which is not here stated - with a loud voice, like the roaring of a lion, as if the nations were called to hear, Rev_10:3.  (5) this cry or roar is responded to by heavy thunders, Rev_10:3. What those thunders uttered is not stated, but it was evidently so distinct that John heard it, for he says Rev_10:4 that he was about to make a record of what was said.  (6) John, about to make this record, is forbidden to do so by a voice from heaven, Rev_10:4. For some reason, not here stated, he was commanded not to disclose what was said, but so to seal it up that it should not be known. The reason for this silence is nowhere intimated in the chapter.  (7) the angel lifts his hand to heaven in a most solemn manner, and swears by the Great Creator of all things that the time should not be yet - in our common version, that there should be time no longer, Rev_10:5-7. It would seem that just at this period there would be an expectation that the reign of God was to begin upon the earth; but the angel, in the most solemn manner, declares that this was not yet to be, but that it would occur when the seventh angel should begin to sound. Then the great mystery would be complete, as it had been declared to the prophets.  (8) John is then commanded, by the same voice which he heard from heaven, to go to the angel and take the little book from him which he held in his hand, and eat it - with the assurance that it would be found to be sweet to the taste, but would be bitter afterward, Rev_10:8-10.  (9) the chapter concludes with a declaration that he must yet prophesy before many people and nations Rev_10:11, and then follows Rev. 11 the commission to measure the temple; the command to separate the pure from the profane; the account of the prophesying, the death, and the resurrection to life of the two witnesses - all preliminary to the sounding of the seventh trumpet, and the introduction of the universal reign of righteousness.  The question to what does the chapter refer, is one which it is proper to notice before we proceed to the exposition. It is unnecessary to say, that on this question very various opinions have been entertained, and that very different expositions have been given of the chapter. Without going into an examination of these different opinions - which would be a task alike unprofitable and endless - it will be better to state what seems to be the fair interpretation and application of the symbol, in its connection with what precedes. A few remarks here, preliminary to the exposition and application of the chapter, may help us in determining the place which the vision is designed to occupy:  (a) In the previous Apocalyptic revelations, if the interpretation proposed is correct, the history had been brought down, in the regular course of events, to the capture of Constantinople by the Turks, and the complete overthrow of the Roman empire by that event, 1453, a.d. Rev_9:13-19. This was an important era in the history of the world; and if the exposition which has been proposed is correct, then the sketches of history pertaining to the Roman empire in the Book of Revelation have been made with surprising accuracy.  (b) A statement had been made Rev_9:20-21 to the effect that the same state of things continued subsequent to the plagues brought on by those invasions, which had existed before, or that the effect had not been to produce any general repentance and reformation. God had scourged the nations; he had cut off multitudes of people; he had overthrown the mighty empire that had so long ruled over the world; but the same sins of superstition, idolatry, sorcery, murder, fornication, and theft prevailed afterward that had prevailed before. Instead of working a change in the minds of people, the world seemed to be confirmed in these abominations more and more. In the exposition of that passage Rev_9:20-21 it was shown that those things prevaile|`|ecd96a5b2b32c9eb8a2400557752c696aa	Yes, and that someone is the Holy Spirit of God.

fee71f13b3c1fcbd618a03eee4ec7248aa	As others have suggested that you register, I would say that there is absolutely nothing wrong with registering for gifts. However, bear in mind that it is never polite to mention registry information on an invitation. Information about your registry should only be spread by word of mouth, to those who specifically ask for it.<br>  <br>  I formerly worked as a gift-wrapper and was in charge of a bridal registry, and when it came time for my own registry, I had become so disgusted by the antics of the brides-to-be who came in for their registries that I didn't have any interest in registering. However, family and friends kept pestering me for my registry information, and finally I succumbed and registered. Then, they seemed displeased that I registered only with general department stores for items that I would find useful, and not the fine china, crystal and other things offered at the much more expensive store where I had previously worked! I have found that when people begin asking, it's best just to take an hour or two of your time and go put in a registry somewhere; for some reason, people seem to find it "rude" to not help them select a gift for you. By the way, we had a small wedding and I didn't even have a formal shower, only a small lingerie party with close friends, and still others were pestering me to register. I didn't expect gifts of any kind, either ... was just hoping for people to come and share our special day.|`|hhkCF3XAaa	On your invitations, in a subtle way, if you want, suggest that any contributions to the charity of your choice would be appreciated. this is a celebration of your matrimony, not a gift grab as previously stated. And those out there who want, will give you a gift. missmanners is highly over-rated. be yourselves, thats all you can do. If you want to register, then do. If people get offended, whats it gonna hurt. Chances are they really dont matter anyhow, but they are to concerned to realize this. DO YOUR THANG!|`|j6itUBG5aa	I probably wouldn't register for gifts - some people might think it's a bit rude seeing you chose to elope, it's one of the things you sacrificed. They might think you're doing a bit of a gift grab.<br>  <br>  BUT... if your close friends and family want to buy you a gift, they will. If I were you I wouldn't create a registry, I'd just leave the gift idea open and those that wish to get you something can and it's their choice.<br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|2d3337cd8ceb8e126b69b3b1d37a1ec1aa	Tacky.|`|52ItvOoWaa	Personally, I don't think it's appropriate and would not do it.  I think the idea of a gift register for a new couple is to help them get started in setting their new home.  You have have been married two years by the time you convalidate your marriage... and I'm sure that when you decided to go through the convalidation ceremony it was not so you could get gifts. <br>  <br>  Your guests' presence at your reception is already, in my opinion, a gift.  They are honoring you and your husband with their presence and in sharing in the celebration of your special day. If some of them will show up with a gift, as I think they will, just accept it graciously. If they don't, be happy and gracious anyway.<br>  <br>  Have a wonderful celebration and may God bless your life together.|`|7gH7sgi6aa	According to Etiquette No!!!  You got married once and you cannot ask for gifts through a "registry" for your "con-validation wedding ceremony.  You may however have people ask what would you like for gifts and it is appropriate to have a list for extremely close family and friends that they could "look" at if needed.  Never put the list in invitations or pass it around except to those few extremely close family and friends and those who ask.  Unfortunately you gave up the "registry" rights when you eloped.  Enjoy your day anyway!!!  Good luck!!<br>  Peace & Love  :)
7e8NN8saaa	I would do a minimum of 20 lbs for that many people. And I have. You can stretch your potatoes a bit if you add sour cream and cream cheese to them when you mash. For really yummy potatoes - cook them in chicken broth instead of water. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://allrecipes.com/" rel="nofollow">http://allrecipes.com/</a> has great tips for mashed potatoes and you can scale the recipes to the number of people you are serving - just be aware that most peoples idea of a serving is much larger than actual serving size - I go 1.5x the number I actually have - so if you are serving 23 you put servings for 35 to have enough. Check the serving sizes to be sure. |`|MoJ62nmJaa	I would say probably about 15 lbs.  You figure about 1/4lb(4oz) to 1/2 lb(8oz) per person and people always want some leftovers!

jLmtqrMmaa	Generally, men have higher sex drives, but it really does depend on the individual.  Also know that women's hormone fluctuations are much wider than men's, which means that they often have much stronger sex drives during some times of their cycle than other times.  So the average woman might want it more than the average man during these times (usually when she is ovulating), but less during other times.  <br>  <br>  And, of course, sex drive for everyone often depends on their emotional/physical state of well-being.|`|ncXMA6rsaa	It's different for everybody.

Each tree is decorated with numbered paper angel tags with the first name, age and gender of a child who will receive the gift. To sponsor a child from the Angel Tree, simply remove one or more tags from the tree and purchase appropriate gifts for the child or children described on the tags. The organization displaying the Angel Tree is also the collection point or drop-off location for all gifts.<br>  <br>  Toys for Tots- The U.S. Marine Corps Reserve Toys for Tots program helps needy children throughout the United States experience the joy of Christmas; playing an active role in collecting and delivering a shiny new toy at Christmas. Local toy collection campaigns begin in October and last until December 22, with toy deliveries normally taking place on December 23 and 24. Community members drop new, unwrapped toys at toys for tots locations, which are collection boxes positioned in local businesses. These toys are stored in warehouses, sorted by age and gender, and then delivered to needy children at Christmastime.<br>  <br>  Operation Christmas Child- Operation Christmas Child brings joy and hope to needy children around the world through shoe boxes or small plastic containers filled with unwrapped toys, school supplies, candy and other gifts, then shipped to needy children overseas with a personal note included. Suggested gift ideas include toys like small cars, balls, dolls, stuffed animals, kazoos, harmonicas, yo-yos, jump ropes, and toys that light up and/or make noise.

Make a Wish’s unique holiday donation options help grant the wishes of children, creating special memories for the wish child and family. Those who adopt a wish by making a donation are provided a unique and special story of how your donation bought joy to a wish child.<br>  <br>  My Two Front Teeth- My Two Front Teeth is a non-profit, charity organization that provides donated toys to underprivileged children in daycare, preschools and community agencies. You can donate toys online; just sign up to receive an email notification prior to the holiday season, choose a child to sponsor and purchase and donate toys to children in need via My Two Front Teeth. My Two Front Teeth offers a personalized, online gift-giving experience to aid underprivileged children. Children are selected through community organizations and allowed to individually pick their one holiday wish.<br>  <br>  The Christmas holiday season is fast approaching, so start an annual tradition of charitable giving, donating toys and other items to needy children and families. Setting the right example and role-modeling heartfelt giving, volunteering to help serve holiday meals in shelters or soup kitchens for the homeless, children are less likely to grow up with a serious case of entitlement and will have better appreciation and gratitude for what parents have done for them throughout the years.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.toysfortots.org/contact_us/de..." rel="nofollow">http://www.toysfortots.org/contact_us/de...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.salvationarmyusa.org/usn/www_..." rel="nofollow">http://www.salvationarmyusa.org/usn/www_...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.liveunited.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.liveunited.org</a>|`|rXY5ntnMaa	My town has a local Toys For Tots program.

AotpBXKQaa	Too many people in this society spell the name of their GOD with a "L".<br>  GOLD!<br>  And the symbol of this God is not a crucifix. <br>  It is "$"<br>  With Gold as their God they justify exorbitant tax cuts for the ultra wealthy.<br>  They explain it as "Our GOLD God must love them because he rewarded them with so much money."<br>  Even if their partners, mates, kids, and servants hate them they are successful and worthy of our envy and adulation."<br>  And this is how they can justify being against the welfare system for the poor. "If God loved them we would have given them more money!"<br>  "Obviously our great God of Gold loves the super rich and hates the poor!"

A marriage is based on compromise, if he's unable to budge on this even a little then I for see trouble in the future. I dated a girl who's father was a strict catholic and her mother wasn't religious at all. They compromised by letting the father take the kids to church and eventually allowing the kids to decide for themselves once they grew older. Your future husband needs to realize that being open minded is not a bad thing. He also needs to realize that in a marriage especially when raising children that your opinion is just as valuable as his.

(Your boyfriend is wrong in that decision).<br>  <br>   With that being said it is extremely important that ALL religion should be introduced despite what you both prefer. It's completely acceptable to state that you both prefer different religions. <br>  <br>  My Great Aunt and Uncle believe in different religions and attend different churchs and their grown kids made the choice on their own and so did their grandkids and they all are extremely successful people.

Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead.

I was raised Catholic. <br>  <br>  IMO I would not marry or raise children with someone with differnt beliefs. It causes division in the foundation of your family and confusion in the spirituality of the children and family. Eventually to avoid arguments you avoid and neglect the foundation of your home. <br>  <br>  And definetly I would NOT even consider spending the REST OF MY LIFE with someone who is so willing to drown out what I feel and believe. Your parents believed the same when they married, then obviously something happened in your moms life to make her decide to chose differently. I would seek advice from her and pray. Dont ever let anyone drown out the holy spirit that has been gifted to YOU. Its a blessing to pass that to your children. <br>  <br>  I live in New Orleans, our homes are built on swamps by fallen angels, you watch the houses sink a little more year after year. Our foundations crack and our homes are not stable. So many home built that way that our city is literally sinking. I mean this literally and spiritually.|`|dSKY9sOqaa	Not if you want well adjusted kids.  Spiritual upbringing is very important, and parents should be united. Catholics believe you need to confess to a priest and pray to Mary and other saints as intercessors, and believe in a good works verses unconfessed bad works, and that after you die people can pray you out of purgatory and into heaven.  Baptist believe that Christ is the intercessor and pray directly.  They believe in salvation by grace through faith only, That you do good works as a faithful servant not to gain favor.  They are similar only that they are both textbook classified as christian.  Children who see their parents divided on religion usually don't choose one or the other, but choose neither.  It does seem a little cult like that you have to pledge to raise your children in the catholic church to be married there.|`|3ZgOAUOTaa	it can work if there is compromise...  you are not describing any...  deal with it now, not later|`|yQNit56Qaa	1) Can a Catholic and a Baptist raise a child together?<br>  <br>  No.  Any attempt to do so will result in immediate imprisonment.<br>  <br>  Come on.  Of course they can.<br>  <br>  <br>  2) About Baptists...<br>  <br>  Well, there are only a couple of religious issues here.  One is infant baptism.  He'll insist on infant baptism into the Roman Catholic Church.  Baptists usually consider such baptisms to be worthless, so that should cause you no grief.<br>  <br>  The other is the Baptist "bible first" doctrine.  This is a minor detail, though, as nearly all of the Roman Catholic doctrines are Scripturally based.<br>  <br>  Baptists have a belief that everyone must adopt an interpretation of Scripture for themselves.  From that perspective, it would seem that the Roman Catholic interpretation is just as valid as any other a Baptist chooses to adopt (see "Bible Freedom" in this section)<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptist#Baptist_beliefs_and_principles" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptist#Bap...</a><br>  <br>  There are also semantic differences in the whole "salvation, faith, works and obedience" thing - but they are purely semantic.  If you examine it closely, I suspect that you will discover that Baptist doctrine allows for nearly all of Roman Catholic doctrine.  The difference may not be as great as you think.<br>  <br>  BTW - I'm a Fundamentalist Christian, not a Roman Catholic.  I just happen to think that Roman Catholics have just as much of an opportunity to be saved as any other individual from any other Christian sect.  I wouldn't want my children raised Roman Catholic because they have doctrines that I believe are not correct - but I would not be dead set against it.  You can still teach them to rely on the bible.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com/selector_rc.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com/selector_rc...</a>|`|ZDDya5Ibaa	You are proof that it can happen.

I remained Protestant for the next 20 years.  I researched the Catholic faith, and found that the core beliefs are the same as mine were as a Protestant.  There were many things I did not understand about the Catholic faith, but I knew they were Christian, and I knew that raising them as Catholic would not be against my values.  No matter how you raise your kids they are going to be free to decide for themselves, just like your Mother did.<br>  <br>  As for me, our kids are in High School and College now, I don't regret raising them in the Catholic Church, in fact, I think it is the best decision we ever made.  I actually even became Catholic myself, after attending and learning about the faith for 20 years.<br>  <br>  But, in the end, that is your decision, don't just go along with it to make peace, or you will resent your husband, that is a very bad way to start out your lives.  You should also talk about Contraception, and Tithing, before marriage.  <br>  <br>  It can work, it did with us, but you both have to be very understanding of each other.<br>  <br>  In the end, you have to decide for yourself.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and God Bless both of you!|`|AA11598520	You can raise the children Catholic but still expose them to all kinds of other religions.

One of you will end up resentful of the other.<br>  <br>  My father is not Catholic (Follower of Christ, I think); my mother was (She's dead now.) My father wasn't so steadfast on his religious beliefs so we were Catholics.

It's not like it takes religion to raise a kid. Who's to say the kid will even be religious or even be of the same one as the parent?

Catholic religion is like the religious leaders of old who told the people half truths just to maintain their own superiority. Catholics teach purgatory when there is none. You cannot pray for the dead because once dead there is not way to get them to heaven if they are in hell. You cannot ask Mary or St. Anthony to help you because they are dead and cannot do it. Jesus is the only mediator between God and man, not any of the others. You know the truth and it<br>  bothers you that he would want to raise any children as Catholics only.<br>  If you cannot agree then you will be unevenly yoked and that is not good for a marriage to succeed.
AA11837789	No, they are not, small town values are just a part of the big city values that engulfes more diversity of people and atitudes than any small town. In addition, what would small town values be without the big city to report to? Based on restriction and strict pudity, specific for a community of people living, just like you said, without the perturbing influences of the outside life a metropole has, with people who have nothing else (literally) to do than stare at each other in different ways, these so highly referred small town values were intially even considered as such only in report (contradiction) to the big cities allegedly lack of.     I am even arguing the legitimity of such a category of moral bakcground such as "small town values". It is within mathematical logic that one cannot base a definition on a negation. So, the small town values being defined as otherwise mundane rules of intimacy that were commonly assumed as simple common sense, only to counteract the diverse and sometimes shocking reality of the metropoles, they cannot constitute a category of refference in themselves. I think, in themselves they simply do not exist.     There is no such thing as small town values. It is just an artificial construction to reinvent an order of society that is thought of as "better" and is going extinct in the city development and can only survive in smaller communities.    But as they say, nostalgia ain't what it used to be. There can be no ending in constructing and reconstructing orders of moral and pudity based on a idealized past background. Because, let's face it, small towns cannot physically constitute a viable development forever. Unless we spread away in the galaxy as well.    Then there will be the talk about Earthling values.

But seriously, in small towns you do knwo everyone and you do care about  them so you tend to be kinder, more courteous and more concerned with their welfare, unlike large cities,  where you pull your car into the garage and close the door before you even get out of the car.... you don't know your neightbors.|`|496421c900779c3f165a888fcacbb093aa	i doubt there is much difference in values but the ability to understand problems is based on what we know. small towns allow me to wear more blinders to the outside, then the daily human drama becomes much too significant.|`|AA10199186	Well....

One thing is very important to remember Every one wants to feel like we are OK in this world & some need to feel above others  inside though we are all about the same.  We have fears, stuff that P Os us, crap that makes us mad and things that make us sad.  The hardest thing you can ever do is be yourself.  I remember my daughter coming home from school one day and she said to me. Mom, today I started my period and I had a little accident on the chair.  A girl in the class room made a big deal about it so every one knew.  I said MAN.Thats gotta  make you feel so bad.  She said No, I just know that this girl must really feel bad about herself to do such a thing to me to make herself stand out in the crowed.
cca7e2c40ff381e20859068dfa1e155caa	Be yourself and flirt just a little.  You are not going to want someone to like you if they do not like you for who you are, right?!  If you think he is worth it, you need to make yourself feel pretty and that might give you that extra little boost of confidence to approach him.  Start off by just saying hi and smile at him.  This will at least get him to notice you.  Once he has noticed you, start a little conversation about a movie you recently saw.  That is an easy subject to start a conversation with.  I hope you at least become friends with this guy.  He will have to first get to know you before he likes you.  Good luck!|`|AA11735896	Show him your t i t s!

Muslims did not hurt Jewish. but in order for the state of Israel to be build, then they need to brainwashed their people to hate Arabs and Muslims. and make them believe that Arabs are their 1st one enemy. so they start killing and destroying. so hate has grow on both sides.     so now jewish are trying to bring christians with their side and wanted to convince them that Arabs are their enemy too.|`|464246167e063a36ae45264fefbb8d4aaa	Hitler's hatred of the Jews were personals.

An example of this can be found in the British newspaper the "Daily News" 25/6/84 under the heading "Shock survey of Anglican Bishops" We read that a British television pole of 31 of the 39 Anglican Bishops in England found 19 to believe that it is not necessary for Christians to believe that Jesus (pbuh) is God, but only "His supreme agent" (his messenger) as taught by Muslims for 1400 years now and testified to by John 17:3 "And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you hast sent." These are not ignorant men, nor are they Muslims. They are eminent Christian scholars who have dedicated their lives to their religious studies, and the study of the Bible and the various discrepancies to be found therein. It is the scientific and logical research of these men into the Bible and other ancient works of the Christian society (in the light of modern knowledge) which is driving them ever closer to the beliefs of the Muslims with every passing day. By Christian standards, these people have everything to lose and nothing to gain by such statements. It is very easy to casually brush off the lifelong study of some of the most eminent scholars of Christendom and label them men of ignorance and proudly claim to be more knowledgeable than them without bothering to study their findings. It is much harder to take the time to study the evidence that drove them to this conclusion. In this book we have presented extensive historical and scriptural evidence in both the Bible and the Christian writings of the first six centuries C.E. which drove these men to their conclusions.     Some people have been commanded to believe blindly in certain matters and never ask questions. Others will insist on giving every single verse of the Bible which contradicts their personal beliefs an "abstract" meaning. When in doubt they say "what the author wrote is not what he meant" and then they proceed to give you their personal interpretation totally side-stepping the obvious meaning of the verses in front of them. No matter how much evidence is presented they are perfectly willing to explain it all away with abstract meanings. On many occasions they don't even bother to analyze their own abstract meanings to see if logic, or the Bible, support them. That is their choice, our job is only to show them the evidence. It is up to them to accept or reject it. "Say: O people of the Scripture! Stress not in your religion other than the truth, and follow not the vain desires of folk who erred of old and led many astray and diverged from the straight path" Qur'an, Al-Maidah(5):77.     When Jesus (pbuh) was among his people, preaching the command of God, he was abused, ridiculed and denigrated. All manner of accusations and propaganda were leveled against him. He was called a liar, a wicked physician, a offspring of adultery, and many other allegations in an effort to dissuade his people from following him. The enemies of God were so bold in their campaign of slander against him that they even went so far as to fabricate lies and slanderous atrocities about his childhood. However, this was to be expected. Indeed, this was the lot of all of the prophets of God since the beginning of time.     In a similar manner, to this day when Islam and Muslims are portrayed in the Western media it is only under the headings of terrorism, extremism, and fundamentalism. Seldom, if ever, is the other side of the story given equal, if any, time. Those who fight so continuously to spread such misconceptions realized that with enough continuous bombardment of such concepts, the masses will eventually come to accept them as "known fact."     As a result of this, when a Muslim quotes from the Qur'an, he is usually perceived as propagating terrorism and heathenistic ungodly violence or similar matters and no one is willing to listen to him. If he quotes from the studies of Muslims, even Christians who have converted to Islam, his words are considered biased and worthless. Even if eminent Christian scholars, unbiased scientists, and the Bible itself are quoted, the Christian scholars are labeled "liberals," and thus unworthy, the scientists as mistaken, and the Biblical verses as not meaning what they say but rather having abstract meanings.     "I shall turn away from my signs those who are arrogant in the earth unjustifiably, and if they see all the signs (in creation) they believe them not, and if they see the path of righteousness they do not take it as (their) path, and if they see the path of misguidance they take it as (their) path. That is because they deny our signs and are used to disregarding them" The Qur'an, Al-Aaraf(7):146.     "They are not all alike. Of the people of the book are a portion whom stand (for that which is right), who recite the revelations of Allah throughout the night while prostrate (before Him)" The Qur'an, A'al-Umran(3):113.     "And Lo! Of the people of the Scripture are those who believe in Allah and that which was sent down to you and that which was sent down to them, humbling themselves before Allah. They purchase not a trifling gain at the price of the revelations of Allah. Verily, their reward is with their Lord, and Lo! Allah is swift to take account." The Qur'an, A'al-Umran(3):199.

Teen pregnancy can be attributed to abstinence education (can't prevent what you don't know about).  Marital rape is a huge problem too, and since marriage is a product of religion...    Morality is a human concept.  Right and wrong were determined by people before we were born.  The fact of the matter is, human beings are animals.  Nothing that lives on this planet has any purpose, except to keep their species alive.  Your morals and my morals can be very different.  You may want to wait for marriage to have sex, while I believe that if you want to do it, then do it...providing the other person agrees, and is of legal age.  Who is going to enforce those morals?  If you look at some middle eastern countries, people are put to death for being "immoral".  Who decides who is more moral?    If you want to end some of these problems, a few things should be done:  a) Require a license and testing to have children.  If you can't take the time to raise them, don't have them.  b) Teach personal respect instead of religious values.  If you teach someone that it hurts another when you steal from them (by example if need be), it holds more weight than "god will send you to hell in x   of years."  c) Stop glorifying the negative aspects of a culture.  Possesions don't create happiness.  When the media forces the "thug life" or materialistic princesses down our throats, and gives these idiots the spotlight, you only perpetuate more negativity.  d) Instill a sense of personal responsibility in your children.  Teaching them that god made the good things happen or the devil made the bad, doesn't teach them that their strength comes from within, it just gives them an excuse.  e) Stop catering to the lowest common denominator.

bafba0d7944b755f0f32244881386872aa	Your message on  the little yellow ball    A viral campaign hands out balls to tweens     By Kathy Prentice   Jun 11, 2006         Viral or word-of-mouth marketing is dependent on consumers getting the message and passing it along. And sometimes it turns to a prop as the vehicle for the message.    In one ongoing compaign, yellow bouncy balls are being placed at parks, malls and playgrounds where tweens hang out. The kids play with them, then log them in online before passing them along. The message, from the Centers for Disease Control: Play ball, stay active.    To find out how to get your clients message presented in a viral format, read on.    This is one in a Media Life series on buying the new out-of-home venues. They appear weekly.    Fast Facts    What  Viral campaigns that rely on specific props to reach the right audience.    Who  The Centers for Disease Control worked with several agencies to implement the yellow ball viral marketing program. For this article, Media Life spoke with New York-based Mr. Youth, the agency responsible for the guerilla portion of the ball distribution.        How it works  Balls imprinted with a code and web site address are distributed to kids to encourage physical activity. How the balls are used is tracked through participation in a unique web site.    The program, called Yellowball, is one element in a larger government-sponsored program called VERB designed to encourage physical activity in kids.      Each ball comes with instructions to log onto a special site and enter a code printed on the ball to create a blog where kids record how they used the ball; for example, playing basketball in the park or a game of catch in the backyard. Kids can read the messages entered by others who played with the same ball. Finally, recipients are encouraged to pass the ball along to another kid. The goal is to combat obesity among children.    Balls are distributed by street teams at parks, malls, practice fields, events and other places where tweens hang out.      This is not our usual mobile campaign, says Doug Akin, vice president for brand development at Mr. Youth. We hired break dancers, circus actors on stilts, local skaters who can go down a ramp at the park doing tricks with the yellow ball. We didnt want to go where parents were with kids, but where kids were with kids.    Balls were often distributed to members of sports teams and other leaders a little older than the target group at events or sports practices.    When looking at guerilla tactics for a specific way to reach 9- to 13-year-olds, you look for leaders. Thats a hard distinction at that age, and its often 14-and 15-year-olds who inspire them. So we needed to go places where their activities are taking place," says Stella Kusner, account director for Frankel, the Chicago agency that oversees the VERB Yellowball program for the CDC.       "The thing with talking to tweens is you really have to keep abreast of whatever is motivating them. They are a very fickle audience. They like something one day and the next day its as pass as it could be.      Television and print ads were used during initial phases of the Yellowball program to introduce the concept of the traveling balls.    Give-aways like branded rubber bracelets in different colors and iTunes offers are also dispensed at events where balls are distributed.    The VERB Yellowball campaign was launched in 2002 and will end this coming September. The guerrilla portion implemented by Mr. Youth will run through June.     Markets  Balls were distributed in Boston, Washington, Philadelphia, New York, Houston, Atlanta, Miami, Orlando, Detroit, Cincinnati, Louisville, St. Louis, Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City, Denver, San Diego, Los Angeles, Portland and Seattle.    This type of viral campaign could be implemented in the top 50 markets, Akin says.     Numbers  There are 22 million tweens aged 9 to 13 nationwide, according to the CDC.    The program aims to distribute a total of 300,000 yellow balls, with the guerilla portion of the program set to hand out 50,000 in 20 markets over eight weeks. So far there have been 250,000 interactions with kids on the part of the street teams.    There are more than 6,000 individual online blogs tracking Yellowball traffic on the web site, www.verbnow.com/yellowball. Additionally, the current top traveling ball logged 39,490 miles while the most often blogged ball has 21 separate entries by different kids who have played with it.    How it is measured  The number of balls distributed and subsequent web site hits are used for measurement.    What weve done is to track the balls distributed, the number of balls registered online, and the number of balls passed along, Akin says. The instructions on the web site encourage them to pass it along to their friends, who then also log on.    Premiums handed out at events, like branded wristbands, also drive traffic to the web site.    What product categories do well  Public service messages, video games, packed goods and movie releases are top categories.    Demographics  Tweens ages 9-13 in urban and suburban settings were targeted. Specific groups, including Hispanic, African American, Asian American and Native American, were targeted by location.

25c43b5fc65eb42314568487bf980fbdaa	When you basically lock yourself away from the rest of the world, that's depression. You can be depressed about something, but that typically wouldn't keep you from doing most of the things you normally would do.    When you're living with depression, you tend to isolate yourself from everyone and everything. Of course, this is the worst thing to do, but it feels like the only thing to do.     I never thought I could ever suffer from depression. In fact, I didn't even believe that it was real. I thought it was a disorder that drug companies, therapists, and people craving attention made up and keep alive to satisfy their own needs. That is, until it happened to me a few years ago.    If you even think that you're facing true depression, as hard as it is, you have to talk to someone. It could be a family member, a friend, clergy, or a professional. It doesn't matter, as long as you have someone you can rely on for support.     I hid from the world and didn't talk to anybody while I was going through it, and it took me months to finally begin to come back. I wouldn't answer the phone and I stayed in my bedroom most of the time. I had kids that needed me, and I knew that, but I wasn't able to be there for them.    Had I let people who care about me know what I was going through, they could have tried to help me. I know that once they found out, they were upset with me that I didn't give them the chance.    Looking back, I'm sure that if I had opened up with at least one good, true friend, I would have been able to get through it a little more easily. And I also think that I made a mistake by not getting some professional help. Not that I would want to spend time in an office with a shrink, but meds might have helped me get to the point where I was functioning more normally.    I'm putting in a couple of links for you to check out. The first is a quick screening test to help you see if you show some of the symptoms of depression. (This is not to make a diagnosis!) The second has a lot of information about depression that might give you a better understanding, and help you figure out what to do next.  Good luck.|`|7438ed1c2a7d28e90f161755d54186bdaa	there is a test online but basically - you either sleep A LOT or have trouble sleep at all, cry a lot, don't eat or eat a lot like a whole cake or pie; feel like no one cares (which is not true); feel like hurt yourself.

It is natural.  It is a mood or emotional state that you can get into, generally occuring from bleak, black or negative thoughts.  It is quite common to wallow in that state for a day or two, or a week.  But it is generally for a short time, depending on how soon you can pull your thoughts and efforts together and refocus on something positive, and pull yourself out of the state you got yourself into.    A person who suffers from depression (maybe technically called morbid depression?) is in an ongoing state of depression that lasts for weeks on end.  And the person who is in that state becomes paralyzed in that state, is incapable of pulling him/herself out of it, and becomes unable to function.  that is clinical and could be a hormonal or chemical imbalance and can only be treated with prescribed medications when it is diagnosed by a practioner.

We receive protection from the Lord and great deliverance when we submit our lives wholly over to Him....but unless we are living sensitive and obedient to His voice and leading, we're pretty much going to reap the fruit of our own ways.  That's not a successful place to be.  We have Adam to thank for the disasters....when he opened the door to the devil, all that was of God in Adam's nature died.  And he passed that along to all of us.  That's why every person is so  in need of Jesus.  Either we are identified with our original ancestor Adam...complete with his fallen nature and rebellion against God....or we are identified with Christ when we believe on Him.  The disasters are not of God...if you didn't see Jesus "ministering" disaster in the Gospels, then God isn't ministering disaster today.  People will tell you the disasters are God's judgment (9/11, Katrina, etc), but the truth is these disasters were either concocted by evil men, or the result of a creation which has been corrupted by Adam's rebellion in the garden.  (It was all put under Adam's care, so of course when he turned it over to the devil we started seeing the devil's influence.)  The Scriptures teach that Jesus came to deliver those who were oppressed of the devil and heal the sick.  He is the full expression of God's goodness, mercy, and the Divine will for every man.  If you don't see Jesus killing babies with cancer in the Bible, then He isn't doing that today.  God's ultimate purpose and plan will be accomplished when this earth is completely delivered and restored...that day is coming, but don't believe the lies against God that you're hearing today.  God isn't the author of our trouble.  We have an enemy who deceives us - his name is satan, and we have our own willful, disobedient, ungodly natures to contend with.  Not everything is the devil...sometimes we manufacture our own trouble well enough without him.  However, God IS the source of our deliverance.  Just like a parent telling you not to play in the traffic when you're old enough to go out on your own, you have to hear and obey that parent in order to stay out of trouble.  God's Spirit leads us away from disasters every day....but not everyone is listening.  And sometimes those who hear willfully disobey.  THAT is the source of the disasters you see....not our Heavenly Father.|`|ddd9b8bb741de808ee6c7f2f0f4dc72faa	God might be in control of the universe, but we are in control on this earth.

Thank thou God, thou art bearing trials in the path of the Kingdom and art enduring persecutions and sufferings.

When Adam (mankind) ate the fruit of the knowledge of both good and evil he received a sentence of death.  To prevent contamination of the Land of the Living with evil we could not remain there so we were cast down to the world of the dead.     Man was exiled from the Land of the Living to the land of the dead where there is no Knowledge, no Wisdom, and no Understanding. Thus Man caused his own death by eating the "fruit" that was poisoned with the "knowledge of evil," and caused himself to be cast into the endless cycle of the fires of Hades. God has never wished to torment Man endlessly in the fires of this world, but He has rather been working for ages on a plan to rescue Man from the place that has entrapped him.    The Scriptures tell us of the plan of God to save us out of the world of the dead and to save us from being condemned along with this world. The theme of the entire Bible (despite its apparent diversity and variety of men who wrote it down) is concerning the plan of God to free man from the captivity he brought upon himself. And man (Adam) has no idea or notion of the sacrifice that God has made for man's redemption -- to free man from the captivity that he works so hard at to retain. The entire Bible, from front to back, is concerned with releasing Adam (Man) from his sentence of death, from his imprisonment in the world, which is "beneath", and restoring him to his former estate.    Man's lack of memory is the reason for the messages from our Father trying to bring former things back to our minds. The Scriptures are the Father's attempts to prod us to remembrance. The beginning of the Book tells us that Man was exiled from the Garden so that he could not partake of the Tree of Life, receiving a sentence of death. The ending of the Book tells us of the resurrection of Man from the dead. The same theme runs through the entire Book, the theme of rescuing Adam from the land of his exile, from the world of the dead.

Evolution has tried, for many years now, to explain how we got here without the loving Hands of our Creator, and genetics haven't proven to be the "magic bullet" that disproves all creationist notions.      The theory has become something of a faith for some scientists.  Kinda strange, from a group of people who prefer empirical fact over, well, faith, no?|`|AA11463083	No, not at all.

Even predentination elements can be found in Gentics, including lunacy, homosexual inclinations, savant connections, etc.    It can even tell you what jobs you'd be best at if we can unravel the coding.    What it can't tell a person without predestination elements is what they will do from moment to moment, but it might tell something about how they react, the mecanism, which is another predestination element.

And for school we went to the 2nd oldest house (200+ years) in our state and the roofs were 4ft tall. Because people were shorter than.    We are always evolving.

Get yourself into a good university and do some Philosophy, this will provide you with the tools to think! This is important. After this pursue a course of Theology and learn historical-critical methods of reading ancient texts and learn Hebrew and (if you are a Christian) Greek. Don't ever make the mistake of thinking that you are reading the Bible in any other language. When we read "Brothers Grimm" in English we are reading a translation of the German - only a translation. The Bible is the same, remember it is not a magical book. Best of Luck.    PS Do not become a Christian Extreemist! Extreemism is the worst variety of religion.

8daa43e46e9b1ec57e9a234440ac908faa	Guarda che il papa non ha criticato la religione islamica, ha solo detto che il rapporto tra uomo e dio non deve passare attraverso la violenza ma attraverso la ragione. Il fatto  che questi islamici non aspettano altro che la minima scusa per protestare e minacciare. Ed  dimostrazione che il 95% di islamici sono dei fanatici senza apertura mentale!

Islam is not only a religion but a complete way of life; we can gain answers either from the Quran or the Hadith (ways of the Prophet Muhammad pbuh). As a practicing Muslim I do believe Islam and its teachings answer all my questions. Muslim nowadays are weak they dont know much about their religion my suggestion is to any one is that read the Holy book of that religion before criticising it. 70% of the Quran has been proven by science. Also we believe in Judgment Day and the Quran describes in detail what the day will be like and also the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) also states minor and major signs (one minor sign we see today is that Time will go faster) you can view the major and minor signs on: http://www.islaam.com/article.aspx?id=45...    Islam has 5 fundamental Pillars which are   SHAHADAH-Declaration of faith  SALAH-Prayer which is the 5 daily prayers (helps us both mentally and physically)  SIYAM-Fasting during month of Ramadhan (Allows us to emphasis people in the poor world, also increases self control and makes us better people in society from decreasing sins to its minimum)   ZAKAT-paying 2.5% of your earnings to charity every year  HAJJ-Pilgrimage to Mekkah (Mecca)    The Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) was born in 670 C.E he came to change the world as it was corrupt at the time. At the time of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) it was known as Jahiliyya (Days of ignorance). Muhammad (pbuh) was the last of Prophets sent to complete the biggest task. He was the Prophet who brought the Quran into our lives; The Quran is the final words from Allah. There has been according to one Hadith 240 000 Prophets, and Muhammad (pbuh) was the last.     The 9/11 proven by many documentaries also proves that there is no 'Islamic terrorists'.     Loose change:http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?doci...

I gave up a lot: quit my schools basketball team bc interfered with salaat time, gave up eating haram food(my entire family still does, so its hard seeing them get mcdonalds and stuff), and I don't go to friends houses bc I'm afraid I won't be able to pray.

I have a friend who's parents are strictly Hindu and they are totally against the idea of Islam. When she converted she didnt tell her parents, she would secretly pray in her room. She was afraid her parents would disown her if they knew.   Finally she got so sick of practicing her religion in private that she told some of her friends that she wanted to get married to a Muslim man so she could move away from all the pressure she was under.   She met a great Indian Muslim man and planned to get married ( this entire time her parents thought he was Hindu as well). Her wedding was to be in a different state and she told her parents that she was Muslim and that her to-be Husband was too.   Just as she feared they disowned her, didn't go to the wedding and haven't talked to her since.   Alhamdulilah she now has a family that love her and care for her. But she still hurts every time she to her children about the grandparents they have never seen :(|`|0gNKRdmiaa	I know what you mean sweetheart, but try to be patient with them because you might be the only Muslim they get to know really well.

If you are very young, just say, "well, hey, I am exploring a religion, that mabey everyone these days should find out about."

It's very wrong of them to question you about such private matters.    Although most Muslims would sympathise with you, most of them would treat their children or relatives the same way you're being treated if they decided to leave Islam. Hypocrisy.|`|lxFV3wK4aa	I wanna first congratulate you because u became muslim,I'm with u my sister u don't have to explain why u choose Islam as if u did a wrong thing,that's ur life not theirs,be sure u r on the right way to live it and win Al-janna, but on the other hand don't forget these people r ur family,Islam order us to deal good with them even if they r not muslims,in Islam we have to obay our parents unless they want us leave Islam or do something prohibited in Islam.  If they knew that u r muslim,try to talk to them in good way,tell them what did u like in Islam,may u can persuade them to be by ur side.  Do that for sometime but if they still against u, u don't have to do anything let u lose ur precious religion,try to find muslim girls to live with them or may u met a good   muslim and marry him,Muslims in ur country can help u.

Maybe he thinks someone forced you into converting, or maybe he's basing his interrogation on his own stereotypes of Islam.

Did you become Muslim recently? Maybe they just need time to adjuse. Over time, they'll just get used to it. This life is a test after all. Just ignore them and be happy with your decision.
38J8nzhBaa	Assuming that you don't "love" all your classmates, I personally would only make them myself if I want to save the money or if I wanted to impress the teacher....  If there is a special person, I personally would go for the self made one and hope they appreciate the effort :)      ....actually....  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine%2...  "In the West, it is the traditional day on which lovers express their love for each other by sending Valentine's cards, presenting flowers, or offering confectionery."    Therefore I think it's wrong of your teacher to force you giving "love notes" to each (!) of your classmates!  Maybe discuss this issue with your parents?!|`|ReGhCqgVaa	I agree with the first post.  Most kids are just going to throw away the valentines.  I would just buy some cute ones and attach some sort of candy to it.|`|sbeHyaCqaa	i think u should buy it.|`|er2H1gQ1aa	Buying valentines would be much easier but I think getting a homemade valentine is so much nicer, if you have the time and energy to put into it!      http://familyfun.go.com/arts-and-crafts/...

Just browse the different links under "Cards for Classmates."|`|yM4Ky46saa	I strongly think that it depends on how many classmates. If you have around 20, I think you should buy them. If it is 30 classmates, it might cost more money and be hard to find. I would suggest you make them. What is it though that you need to make valentine cards or girfts?

This one is for valentine gifts and stuff:    http://fun.familyeducation.com/valentine...|`|Du5IZi81aa	If you want to have fun while putting together your valentines I would make them homemade. In my opinion its better than just rushing out to the store fighting over cheap valentines cards that will only be thrown away and not appreciated.   A few years ago for one of my old boyfriends I woke up early and made him white chocolate covered pretzels before school and filled them in a tin. He loved them!!! And he always asked me to make them for him. People always love home made foods, and if your looking to impress your crush than you gotta win the love to his stomach ;)  Use low sodium mini pretzels  (with the chocolate on them you dont want them loaded with salt yuck.)  with some regular milk chocolate and some white chocolate, or even half and half. And its also great because its practically mess free and its easy to carry. Don't buy cheap chocolate, but don't make your parent(s) spend a fortune. I found a site with a simple recipe and steps that you can use.   what you could do for the "card" is fill candy bags with the pretels and tie it with bows and just attatch a personal note on some nice paper  onto the bow to each of your friends. that way each person will have a different one and will feel special with thier own unique valentine,  ( also this way you wont have 20 different hands fondeling all over the yummy food! lol )    If you decide to do this let me know how it goes! :)  sorry its so long lol but I hope I helped    http://www.cooks.com/rec/view/0,171,1491...|`|WaflDTQfaa	It depends if you have a lot of time.

Purtroppo sono locali privati e quindi si possono permettere di fare questo tipo di "trattamento". Per evitare problemi conviene, se si deve frequentare questi posti particolari, presentarsi sempre vestiti un po meno casual.

Ora, l'unica eccezione che i locali potrebbero eccepire  il disturbo che eventuali clienti potrebbero provocare (es. ubriachezza, rissa...) Ma cmq in questi casi non possono ricorrere al buttafuori ma sarebbero tenuti a chiamare la polizia ed i carabinieri, gli unici legamente legittimati ad intervenire (e ad allontanarti... oltre che a prendere i provvedimenti - es. fermo presso i loro uffici, o segnalazione alle forze dell'ordine etc etc - che ritengono necessari se hai commesso qlc contro legge).

AA10550142	I will teach you this:    There are some people from which you can learn nothing useful.    There are some people that are basically stupid, some ideas senseless, some opinions irrevocably wrong.    Everyone has a right to their own perspective?  Yes, of course.  And everyone has the right to be wrong, as well.    Despite the opportunities for learning afforded you by virtue of your tolerance, you demonstrate a degree of ignorance by suggesting that everyone can learn from everyone else- which simply isn't true.  I have nothing to learn from you, for instance.    Humility, you might suggest?    At that, I suppose you consider humility a virtue, which it isn't.  Humility is a virtue to the timid and weak, but a vice to the great.    That is my lesson for you.|`|AA12343309	Yes, and we can express our beliefs fully in a manner which are not smug and disparaging toward someone else.|`|a20537f9e60f7882d8fd2800775d174caa	Seek all the knowledge you want from man but measure it carefully against the Word of God.

I SOMETIMES FIND IT AMUSING THAT THE VERY PEOPLE I WRITE ABOUT PROVE ME RIGHT WITH THEIR THUMBS DOWN.  IT DOESN'T TAKE ANYONE WITH EVEN  A SLIGHT MEASURE OF INTELLIGENCE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE MUST BE INFINITELY MORE INTELLIGENT THAN MERE MANKIND.

I respect Christians and their beliefs along with many other religions. Just because I don't particularly like their beliefs or don't believe in them doesn't make me better than them or vice versa.
AA10137898	Many people think of Baphomet, who (fyi) has no historically ancient origin.  Baphomet is not Babylonian or related to Pan of Greece or Faunus of Rome, no connections at all.    Baphomet is a stylized image of this winged goat-man whose purpose was to teach several mysteries, and oftentimes was used to represent the beliefs and ideals of the Knights Templar.  When a new person was going to be unducted they were show this image and they would be asked what it revealed to them.  Many of the common Christians would go mad in disbelief and believe it was the devil, while people who were actually seeking the Mystery Tradition saw something very different.    Sometimes Baphomet is called the Sabbatic Goat.  The torch on the top of his head represents divine wisdom.  The Pentagram, point up, represents the presence of the divine spirit.  The positions of the arms (one going up the other down) represents the two worlds between ours, that of the Divine and Heavenly beings in contrast to that of the Underworld and spirit beings.  The hands are held with the thumb, index, and middle fingers straight while the ring and pinky fingers are curled.  This position is recognized as the hand gesture of blessing, a very common ritual act.      The upward pointed arm has written on it the Latin word "solve" which means to break down, dissolve or release.  The downward pointed arm has written on it the Latin word "coagula" literally meaning curds, as in a coagulation or formation, manifestation.      The animal attributes (goat, birds wings, etc...) relate to the earthly physical realm of animals and animal-like behaviors.  The female breasts identify that the divine is both male and female.    The erect phallus and two snakes create the famous Caduceus of Mercurius or Hermes.  The Caduceus represented the attributes of the herald.  The erection and halo-like feature detail the power that sex can generate (think of tantra or sex magick).    Overall, Baphomet is merely a symbol representing the idea that every individual is blessed with the divine spirit and through the exorcising of our innate ability to create and destroy with the employed powers of the Divine or of the Ancestral dead we can attain divine wisdom or enlightenment.  In gaining enlightenment, each individual is risen above their inherent animal-like nature and can recognized the unity of the Divine.      However, Baphomet was no a deity of any kind, just a symbol to detail the teachings and beliefs of the Knights Templar.      However it is a common belief that the Knights Templar did venerate the decapitated head of John the Baptist.  **Veneration and worship are two different things, worship is given to the Divine, to God.  Veneration is given to the people or items that have been blessed by the presence and/or touch of the Divine or God.|`|aa35e095a615d2c9fa9251d229a3968aaa	It had nothing to do with goats heads. It was all about cats, and the severed head of another human being. One suggestion is baphomet, a babylonian god. However, I wouldn't accept any of these, as the whole persecution of the templars was due to them being more powerful than phillip the fair, king of france, who together with the pope at the time, fiorced the dissolution of the order, and arrested the templars so he could seize their land.|`|825953318303d03d2a0b5c5c512b8f40aa	I think it was - Something about Mary.|`|787aed0fbf246f2ca2f1ec59b6bdd29daa	Satan.|`|11d70d4b12abc40a7c25e217544293c2aa	simon templer a bit of a saint|`|AA11085415	Your thinking something like PAN  That is Greek and Roman stupid stuff  It was something like Ducats but today is is just called money or dollars---- see a numastasis (s) coin collection store.|`|anxUzteSaa	Ernie.    or Amon. whatever.|`|AA10550142	Baphomet is the name you're looking for.

In at least one form I'm aware of, they do believe in hell, but don't believe they will end up there as their diety will 'win' the final battle the christians think is coming.  They also believe that as long as there are christians, there will be a need for a 'devil' figure to keep the chrisitians 'in line'.  Therefore, he will STILL reign over the earth.  In other words - the Christian god will 'throw' the match as punishment for all the misbehaving christians.  The christian god fellow has done strange things before when displeased, you know.    ~Morg~

EzRCIlS1aa	I figure the best way is to correct your mistakes:    I am frustrated trying to express myself in English, and I need sincere advice, please. Thanks in advance.    English is not my first language, but I like it because it's a tool to exchange your views, and to gain knowledge about other thoughts and cultures. I think I am failing to use it correctly, and I don't know where the problem is. I think, personally, that I can give better answers to particular questions, but when I attempt to, I feel helpless to express my true meaning. My answers are ignored because no one is able to understand what I'm describing. Mostly, I can't understand some questions, and I don't know why. So, I need your advice because english is your first language. What should I do to improve my grammar, articles, punctuations, idioms/phrases, etc.? What will be most helpful? Please, help.    Hope this helps you out. Don't feel alone though, I sometimes have trouble understanding the questions; and I understand and speak the english language!  That's my two cents for ya.|`|48059b1217c0db411cd0097366164c61aa	Your eagerness to learn and understand another language is commendable and I admire your progress so far.....The fact that you want to learn english is a tool in itself, people who really want to achieve something usually manage it due mainly to their enthusiasm.......  Why don't you try listening to BBC radio where english is spoken all the time, that way you will hear the spoken word, how the sentences are made up,correct pronunciation and phrasing.........English is a very powerful language because it has a larger vocabulary than any other language, this is due to the fact that England was invaded so many times over the years by different nationalities such as the Danes and the Romans and French who all left their mark so to speak, consequently  English has many words all of slightly different meaning to describe one thing so there is a greater depth of meaning and one can describe exactly what is required.....

It was the best way for all of us to learn this beautiful & lively language because we had the wonderful opportunity to interact with one another on a daily basis and we also had the chance to hear something vital first hand (with a little help from our qualified teacher, of course!): the English pronunciation!    If going to school doesn't appeal to you or is something that is not available to you where you live, you could always buy some tapes (or borrow them at your local library) and learn that way at home alone and at your own pace.    What do you think about all this so far?    I must confess that I also learned quite a lot by watching many American TV programs and by watching movies in English at the theater on the week-ends, not to mention writing down on paper endless lyrics from songs I really liked listening to; that helped me tremendously with my spelling, grammar, syntax & vocabulary!    I can see by your question that you need a lot of tutoring but help is at hand so stop worrying so much!    You still have a lot of work ahead of you but don't despair!    Enjoy learning this great language; you will have a lot more fun with it that way, I can promise you that!    Good luck to you & keep working hard!          P.S. Is Arabic your first language, by any chance? Mine's French!|`|9ee31f6ad55abff4de3f8f5aaae5508daa	You don't seem to be having any problem describing your question here.

Admiring beauty is not quite the same thing as having an orgy!  How did we get to be so many on this planet when there are so many prudes?|`|NUSDWVOmaa	Oh man am I ever with Moon Unit on this.    There is so little beauty in the world, appreciate what you find.  Just because your father and brother admire the beautiful women doesn't mean they would shag them in front of you, or even behind your back.    If you never admire the physique of muscular men, that is just your own private loss.  I don't know how old you are, perhaps some day you will better learn to appreciate fine art and sculptured physiques.    Ok, if he says, "check out the rack on that babe," or does cat calls, or drools on himself--yes, that is being a bit obnoxious.  If a woman doesn't like being quietly appreciated, why does she dress up?  Is that just for one person?  Whenever I dress up, I hope everyone appreciates the effort I took.  Otherwise, it is wasted.  Why bother?|`|9449e10cc4bd54a354c906e0564176ecaa	I can see where it would make you uncomfortable.

A man should be able to control his passions and a responsible father should not encourage his son to lust after a woman.    The random woman who walks by a man does not belong to that man. She should not be used to give him pleasure. That is turning her into an object.    And what if she is another man's wife? That makes it even worse.

AA10550142	You can pretty much count on your question (or answer) getting a thumbs down or two if you firmly state any opinion on R+S.  It's not really a clan, per se; there is a pretty even balance here between Christians and theists, and enough Muslims and Wiccans to keep things interesting for all.    The only answers that don't seem to get any thumbs down are "I think everyone has the right to their own beliefs" and drivel of that same sans-animus ilk.|`|b9906294d88c8e875c10481120cf0286aa	I don't know why thumbs down gets people so upset. It just simply means it is not a good answer. I have given thumbs down on some questions that I really want to give a thumbs up because Their point is valid, but there is an untruth or it is unintentionally misleading.     I also give a thumbs up on some answers that  I disagree with, but are informative and show they did research.    Besides Christians give as many thumbs down to those they disagree with as unbeliever, I think more so because it is personal to them.     Honestly I cannot see Christ in the fruits of thes Christians here in Y/A R&S.|`|8601ee9ab2dba927dfd206431ddbf9b6aa	It isn't the majority.

Truly Jehovah-based theology (the utter negation of self and reason in favor of the slavery of revelation) has gone by the wayside.  Megachurches have taken a numinous, ego-comforting, "seeker friendly" perspective.  Intelligent design, while annoying, lets us know that Christians understand that the Genesis account isn't literally true and that they're struggling to find a way to keep Jehovah in the equation.  The more decent and intelligent "sinners" that Christians are exposed to, the more they tend to turn away from fundamentalist ideologies.    The dawn of the Satanic age is here.  I don't know that we'll ever get rid of stupidity entirely, but hopefully we'll get to a point where people are embarrassed to admit being Christian or Muslim and where gays, atheists, and pagans are free to stalk the street with impunity.

The Dark Lord Satan already has a firm control of the earth. The real question is... when is Jesus going to come back and redeem the earth... That happens in Revelation... The scroll with 7 seals... In early jewish history, a title deed to a property was sealed with seven seals, and only the Kinsman redeemer of the land could open it. In Revelation it depicts Jesus as the redeemer who opens the 7 seals to the title deed of the earth, in which seven judgements are delivered on the earth....

And even though you being evil think hell is a party, you have never known the absense of the spirit of the Lord, his spirit fills the universe, and he causes the rain to fall on the just and the unjust.

Si no tienes estas  bendiciones puedes buscarlas,  ya comenzaste inquietandote  por  como llegar al cielo, puede que a futuro Dios  te revele de manera directa  o  a  travs de  diversos medios  sus secretos maravillos  y oigas  su voz  llamandote  para que hagas parte de la corte celestial  donde por derecho propio debes estar.    Al leer la palabra de Dios veras  que en  el cielo no hay sexos, que no hace falta  ningun placer, ni hay necesidad de alimentos, luz,  techo o dems comodidades que como humanos debemos  tener,   pues  la vida espiritual que proviene de Dios es  tan perfecta que no requiere ningun  otro  ingrediente  para   la felicidad plena.       Otro es el estado en el que estaran aquellos que no crean, que no busquen al Se?or JESUCRISTO a tiempo  pues   para ellos esta reservado el castigo eterno  en el lago que arde con fuego  y azufre.    como recomendacin muy  bsica es necesario leer de manera detallada el nuevo testamento    y  asi tendrs   mucha informacin  que te ayudara  a sacar tus  propias conclusiones y evitar   confusiones  generadas por la ignorancia de  muchos  que se  hacen pasa por  maestros    Un abrazo.|`|1LHsMf6uaa	Entonces tengo acumulado mucho mas|`|1luR7wNkaa	Siempre pes, cuando era creyente..., que en el cielo, me estaba construyendo una casita con parcela...

Also, no one will be able to prove it is not. So we might as well move on.|`|AA11284584	Because there is a small, fearful contingent of pathetic human inhabitants on this planet who desperately want to demoralize Christian believers.   Of course, that is impossible to do.      So far, they have failed to disprove anything written in the Bible.  All evidence that has been discovered has instead supported it.|`|6134f665c5023e539c6377bb34d3050eaa	 evidence is evidence, whether at matches one's beliefs or not.  You can't dismiss findings because they contradict your faith.  It is interesting that some people dismissed the tomb before any research had been carried out when it was first discovered.  Now it has been brought back into the public eye and again it is dismissed.  Whether is it the tomb of Jesus and his wife and kid or not is not as interesting as watching the different reactions from different faith groups.|`|AA11590382	Jesus resurrected and even if it isn't Jesus' bones who cares cause everyone that believes in Jesus and reads this question just thinks " here's another person thinking up another reason to not believe in him" when in the end everyone needs someone to look up to, someone to guide them, and someone to love them|`|OWVjRxjTaa	it doesnt matter wat tey say. christ hav already said "for i know this, that after my departure savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock. also from among yourselves men will rise up, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after themselves"(Acts 20:29,30). christ hav already warned us about all this. for the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God   Have faith people.|`|AA10704346	For all who believes in Jesus and Christianity, don't be puzzled about this things happening on Earth. Many events right now comes on our society about our Lord Jesus. There's Da Vinci code before, and now, about the allegedly "tomb of Jesus". All of this things trying to shake our faith. But again, don't be puzzled and shaken about all this things. As the Bible says that "anti-Christ" will come out in the open, many false prophets will come to fool many people. Read Matthew chapter 24. One thing must be done by people, stay doing good to others, love your neighbors and your families. Do not do things that are against your conscience, and live a simple life.|`|apESK3Puaa	Basically because as, St Paul said, "If Christ be not risen from the dead, then is your faith vain". Those arranging this display want Christians to give up and shut up.  But what they say in Europe about it is worth repeating here. The quality papers have articles written by journalists and archaeologists who are not Christian, but who nonetheless see all that hullabaloo in New York primarily as a means of making money out of worthless evidence. They point out that Mary was by far the most common name in Israel in Jesus's time, and Jesus and Joseph were very common names too. (You only have to look at the crowd of Marys at the foot of the cross mentioned in the Gospels to see how common the name was). Jesus is Latin for  Iesous, which is the New Testament Greek form for Yeshua, Jesus's Jewish name. Yeshua is the same name as Joshua, who was the great military leader who after Moses conquered the Holy Land for the Jews. At a time when the Jews had been conquered by Greeks and then by Romans and occupied under the rule of a Roman Governor, to call your child Joshua (Yeshua) was a patriotic act that showed you hoped he would free the Jewish nation. These were really common names at the time. And what is the value of a DNA test when nobody knows anything about the DNA of the "prophet" Jesus? Nil!  In any case Jesus's family came from Nazareth, a tiny and very poor village in the far North of Israel. They were not a rich family of the capital, able to afford a rich cave tomb with a scuptured doorway, something that must have cost a fortune to dig out and carve. Jesus's father was a simple village carpenter, his friends simple fishermen from Lake Galilee. That is where he lived and preached most of the time, just coming up to Jerusalem to celebrate the passover, knowing his enemies would kill him there. His father is never mentioned after Jesus's childhood and probably had been dead for 15-20 years.   The only reason Jesus was buried in a rich cave-tomb was because his richest follower, Joseph of Arimathaea, lent his disciples his own unused tomb to put him in. Probably, had his body rotted there, it would have been placed by Joseph in a big jar, and then he would have buried himself there and his own family, too.

Among these books is the Quran, which God revealed to the Prophet Muhammad .  God has guaranteed the Qurans protection from any corruption or distortion.  God has said:    " Indeed, We have sent down the Quran, and surely We will guard it (from corruption). " (Quran, 15:9)    The Quran, the last revealed word of God, is the primary source of every Muslims faith and practice.  It deals with all the subjects which concern human beings: wisdom, doctrine, worship, transactions, law, etc., but its basic theme is the relationship between God and His creatures.  At the same time, it provides guidelines and detailed teachings for a just society, proper human conduct, and an equitable economic system.     The Quran was revealed to all humanity not just Muslims.  Ever since the Quran was revealed, fourteen centuries ago, no one has been able to produce a single chapter like the chapters of the Quran in their beauty, eloquence, splendor, wise legislation, true information, true prophecy, and other perfect attributes.  Also, note that the smallest chapter in the Quran (Chapter 108) is only ten words, yet no one has ever been able to meet this challenge, then or today. Some of the disbelieving Arabs who were enemies of the Prophet Muhammad  tried to meet this challenge to prove that Muhammad  was not a true prophet, but they failed to do so. This failure was despite the fact that the Quran was revealed in their own language and dialect and that the Arabs at the time of Muhammad  were a very eloquent people who used to compose beautiful and excellent poetry, still read and appreciated today.

From conception, they are influenced, however, from the beliefs of the parents, as far as their treatment of the feutus is concerned.     Let me explain by example.  When I was pregnant, expecially when I was taking a shower, I would always sing a particular song while I caressed my belly.  As the baby grew, I sang the song more and more often.  Before my child could talk, she was humming the song.    You see dear, we can joke about the important issues in life, whether God exist or not, etc., however, in the final analysis, we are determining the eternal destiny of our souls and that of our children.

Based on the culture we are born in, we more often than not are indoctrinated or brainwashed in the religion of our parents when we reach the so-called "age of reason."     Statistically speaking, I would imagine the percentage of adults who cling to the religion of their parents and their own culture is very high. However, more and more are exercising their critical faculties to question the stupidity of their religious upbringing and "unyoking" themselves from the brain poison called "religion." That is heartening news indeed.    |`|oafXYOnJaa	None of us are born "anything" per se, it takes a selfish parent to "program" religion into the offspring.|`|7btr3zB8aa	zero, zero, zero.    Babies are born ignorant. They 'know' how to poop, cry, and suck tit (and how I envy them their swanky lifestyle).    To take a stance on gods you have to be able to grasp the concept.|`|BHVMx1paaa	Hehe well I assume you're asking this to be controversial but if by "atheist" you mean "believes in no God" then 100%.|`|Qb3V42snaa	We are all born as atheists.  We're born into those families that teach us their religious culture and we adopt that as part of our identity.   |`|hMKKf8Iwaa	All of them.  Belief in a god or gods is something that is taught later.  No baby is born with a belief in anything.  At some point, we are all Atheists.  |`|ByuoZqVPaa	I think they are all born with no religion, and accept the religion their parents impose upon them until they gain enough knowledge to make the choice for themselves.  I guess people could be born with a predisposition to a certain religion depending on what personality etc they inherited from their parents.  I think they would worship the 'mother' or whoever is providing them with sustenance.   Do pagan's and hindu's worship the mother?|`|30da49ce7350d87aa6b90301d5bc7940aa	None, beliefs are learned not inborn, otherwise there would be no need for religious instruction.|`|7cjn2u9uaa	People say they are born atheist, but I disagree, by your definition of being inherently of that belief at birth.  Babies are born with no belief system. |`|AA10348999	100% are born atheist most are raised and indoctrinated into religions.|`|6064bd72a9d33a8f2e618cc79b0f9629aa	Every single person lacks belief at birth, making them default, "implicit" atheists.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	Everyone is born atheist and babies do not have the thinking capacity to even know what religion is.    Therefore religion can only be imposed on them in their parents minds and the child will not comprehend or understand even the basic idea for several years!!    So 100% are not just born atheist but stay atheist for several years no matter what the parents want!!|`|r8rykCkGaa	No such thing as being born these things in the sight of God.  It's when you are old enough to decide for yourself that it makes the difference.  No one has ever been born Christian.  The Muslims claim their children are born Muslim but in the sight of God that is not truth, neither is it for atheists.|`|564d359090a6d360bec9ee3849107a51aa	none.|`|22hX0vDNaa	I was born atheist ^-^|`|u53ISZoXaa	I guess your answer lies in what ever percentage of the world consider themselves to be atheists.

Could 200,000,000 babies worldwide be wrong?|`|Rt4bJfVAaa	I disagree totally that a baby is born an atheist.  For an atheist in the normal definition that we most intellectuals use today is the complete denial of any deity.  And this is only after observing and experiencing life.  How can a baby know anything about life at all let alone what a God is.  And for that matter if they were born "atheists" they were converted to religion naturally by their parents?   That whole logic is flawed.    A child is born without knowledge of what belief is.

AA10550142	I like your policy.  Of course, gays aren't asking for special priveledges.  They only want the same thing anyone else has- the opportunity to know that their loved ones are protected by their insurance, can be visited in the hospital, can file jointly on their taxes, may raise children with them, will inherit their wealth without need for a last will and testement, etc.  They are not asking for anything that isn't already covered in the laws for marriage.    Marriage is not a moral insitution anymore- it's a legal one.  Homosexuals are not interested in your business; they just want you to stay out of theirs.|`|490a314a05df559b9a015f4063ae6c83aa	Go live by yourself on a deserted island or contribute to democracy, if you don't vote then nothing changes.

Quit crying, stop bitching and grow up.|`|dd4781d5a60c951a4875e45e546316aeaa	Hi there,    You are probably one of the vast silent majority when it comes to fanaticism, most people are just so busy trying to get by that they are genuinely astonished at the actions of fanatics.   Fanatics, however, are everywhere!  Some are fanatic about boy bands, or Mary Kate and Ashley, steam trains, 50's noir films; these fanatics are harmless.  But as we veer onto religion, well, that's an entirely different can of worms.  Neither you nor I will ever be so subsumed by the cult of God, whether he is there or not, that we will ever feel the need to send the infidel, apostate, heretic, agnostic, atheist and any other non or un or any kind of believer to their great, (or not) reward by persuasion, failing that by violence, failing that by annhialation!  Take heart, at the moment there's more of us than there is of them, how can they beat apathy of a spiritual nature?  By the way, I am a Presbyterian Scot, I'm not sure if I  believe or not but I surely  expect the right to make up my own mind!!|`|AA10860202	I agreed with you until you said " I feel the whole gay marriage thing is just a push to gain special privelages, poolitical power, and attention to themselves like the gay parades and holidays."

8e28ad49d99988787c3b86c641d381b6aa	By asking me to identify personally these Jews and Muslims are described God in Jesus message to ignore the reality of God.    I also don't know who the fundamental Christians are, that believe only their particular sect of Christianity, or church will guarantee people place in heaven.    The world is full of individuals who insist on interpreting God's understanding of love as their own personal version.      Part of that is fine because it encourages us to interpret God's reality in individual way, in a way that society can understand, in a way that works for us.  However, when we transport our personal values outside of our community, than we run the risk of making God sound ridiculous, and making our reality into the world reality simply is not where it's at "at".      So for me to comment on what you described as Jews and Muslims is not appropriate, for it is my personal understanding lined up against there's, and either aligned with yours or apposed to you.    To do so would be to say that my ego somehow supplants the will, the understanding, and the vision of many other humans within our planet.|`|ebc5fdfac8f50e088056beb5d5d6f767aa	Your "God" doesn't even have a true name. He's real, but minor. There are many God's that aren't as jealous and violent, because they have faith in themselves and Don't depend on fanatic followers.|`|AA11047076	Umm- they believe in the reality of God and thus ifnore extraneous factors like people trying to alter God's laws even though it clearly says they are eternal?  Or how about they are the people that followed the religion that jesus followed, saw that he offered nothing new, corrupted the teachings of the Torah and would lead them astray if they followe dhim- so they ignored him and carried on worshipping God as they had been for 1500 years before Jesus was born.  And nope- we don't define Jesus as a "message", we completely ignore him as he is irrelevant to Judaism, Judaic belief or Judaic practice.  he is not a message, he is nothing to us.|`|AA10828990	Which is what, mouthbreather?|`|AA11439912	Time for our daily dose of hate already.

AA11491405	I use "I" statements all the time in regards to me|`|eea28160e2175a4c8a06986bd36ddfe0aa	Yes.  Here.  Let me start.    I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible.    And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of the Father before all worlds; God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God; begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father, by whom all things were made.    Who, for us men for our salvation, came down from heaven, and was incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the virgin Mary, and was made man; and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; He suffered and was buried; and the third day He rose again, according to the Scriptures; and ascended into heaven, and sits on the right hand of the Father; and He shall come again, with glory, to judge the quick and the dead; whose kingdom shall have no end.    And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of Life; who proceeds from the Father and the Son; who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; who spoke by the prophets.    And I believe one holy catholic and apostolic Church. I acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins; and I look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.|`|312c8347ce7086a6ca423f482a2cab1eaa	I always try to. :)|`|AA11623828	Yes, I agree. I believe this post is right on accurate. And I use that wording for people with genuine questions.

I will not soften my statements for your benefit or anyone else's.    Would you suggest that an elementary math teacher tell his students "I _believe_ 2+2=4"?    Of course not!  What about a physics teacher- should they begin their statements on even the most elementary topics with "I think ..." "I feel ..." or "I believe"?  No.    And here WE are, talking about religion.  Religion (psychology, sociology, anthopology and metaphysics) are not just subjects that I have casually parused on my days off; these are topics into which I have delved in such depth as might crush the very minds of ordinary men with the weight of them.  I know of what I speak and my confidence will not be shaken.  Should I soften my words for the laity?  NO.    Consider that I am probably more intelligent than _every_ person you have met in your entire life.  I am also more studied.  I don't _believe_ that I require your permission to tell you that you're wrong about religion- or any other subject for that matter.    Do you suggest that religion is a matter for belief, not truth?  What, then, is knowledge?  What is truth?  What I mean to say is this: if I know the truth, of what use is belief?  I have come to truth through years of the scientific and wholistic study of religion.  The truth is that adherents to religion care _little for truth_.    And what is adherence to religion if not deliberate and systematic application of delusion toward the goal of permanent ignorance?  Indeed it is the opposite of truth!    Now, imagine that I am a teacher who has just taken over an elementary classroom, and I ask the students "What, class, is the sum of 2+2?"    "3" they answer me, smiling.    Damn that man who has led these young ones astray from truth!  That contemptable teacher (priest)!  That horrible administration (government)!  That unforgivable parent teacher organization (mainstream culture)!  They have led these people not only down a path of falsehood, but down a path from which return may be difficult or impossible!    And you ask me to offer the words "I believe".  NO.  I should be a better man if I would begin with:    I AM DISGUSTED.    Now I am going to take a break, because I am so infuriated at the very arrogance of your suggestion that I have worked up an appetite for meat.|`|7de37e06e2cb9f4b0fa0e4032572179eaa	I don't have a problem is stating what is my opinion with an I statement.  I was taught that one of the true testaments of a person is how they stand up for what THEY think and believe.    Too many people hide behind WE or blanket YOU statements and make blustery comments to try to beat down people.  To be blunt I think it's cowardice.  If you can't stand up for what you personally believe, then you ought to sit down.    According to the Jewish, Christian belief the most powerful statement ever made was I AM.

Frightening, oppressive, or unpleasant sexual dreams often related to repressed.unresolved spiritual problems, according to Taylor ( a dream expert). Some authorities believe that violently explicit sex dreams or negative sex dreams can be a marker of earlier sexual abuse.     Dreams of having sex/orgasm are normal for both males and females. Although sexual dreams can pinpoint sexual problems or physical problems, they are just as likely to be symbolic of your own masculine/feminine aspects or attitudes, especially if dreamed immediately after intercourse.     The Freudian perspective most, if not all, dreams will disclose some underlying infantile sexual wish/attitude. waking events won't enter your dreams unless related to deep - seated feelings or attitudes. Any conflicts about sexuality will be reflected in sex dreams. Many sex dreams are heavily disguised for other activities. For instance, going in or out through a back door can represent anal intercourse.     Sexually explicit dreams can be understood on three levels according to Natterson and Gordon : 1) relate to an overt sexual need/issue 2) tell you something about a waking relationship 3) reveal perceptions about your sexuality in the context of your society.     How you feel in a dream - happy, satisfied, being forced, or fearful - may give you some clues to your attitude about sex.     A partner known from your past ( though not necessarily a sex partner) may relate to aspects of that person you need to incorporate into your waking life; unfinished relationship issues; conflicts about a customary way of relating that have been activated by a recent experience.

60fffe56ab6697e6c23058a8867e156baa	Lakshmi is goddess of wealth in hindu mythology.|`|e43c70f0ddb74bd3e9e8e01784a9fa8faa	Also known as SRI, Lakshmi is the wife of Vishnu and is the Hindu goddess of good fortune and beauty.|`|ba66f8de57cec8832d1d017187968f4aaa	Hi ethan,                In Hinduism lakshmi in the goddess of wealth, light, wisdom and fortune etc. For more information on your question.  Check this out: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakshmi|`|AA10550142	In Hinduism, Lakshmi or Laxmi (Sanskrit: ??????? lak?m) is the goddess of wealth, light, wisdom and fortune, as well as (secondarily) luck, beauty, courage and fertility. Representations of Lakshmi (or Shri) are found in Jain and Buddhist monuments, in addition to Hindu temples.    In Puranic Hinduism Lakshmi is the Mother of the Universe and Vishnu's Shakti. Lakshmi is consort to Vishnu, and also married his incarnations Rama (in her incarnation as Sita), Krishna (as Rukmini) and Venkateshwara (as Alamelu).|`|f3e3a1944d6e9406c7ef8dabc82b9109aa	Physically Goddess Lakshmi is described as a fair lady, with four arms, seated on a lotus, dressed in fine garments and precious jewels. She has a benign countenance, is in her full youth and yet has a motherly appearance.    Lakshmi was the daughter of the sage Bhrigu and took refuge in the ocean of milk when the gods were sent into exile. Lakshmi was reborn during the Churning of the Ocean.    As soon as the gods saw Lakshmi, they all fell in love with her beauty. Shiva claimed Lakshmi as his wife, but since he had already taken the Moon, her hand was given to Vishnu, whom Lakshmi herself preferred.    Lakshmi was reborn as his consort each time when Vishnu incarnated. For example, Lakshmi was Sita to Rama, Radha and later Rukmini to Krishna.    Lakshmi is the goddess of light, beauty, good fortune and wealth. Being the consort of Vishnu, the preserving principle, Lakshmi also signifies love and grace. Lakshmi often expresses her devotion to Vishnu by massaging his feet as he lies on the coils of the snake Shesha. While Lakshmi is generally worshiped to achieve success, she does not reside long with anyone who is lazy or desires her only as wealth.    Hindus pray to Lakshmi the most on Diwali, the festival of lights. According to tradition people would put small candles outside their homes on Diwali and hope Lakshmi will come to bless them.|`|37ab3b548443ae93a5a0b514ffc24bcaaa	Lakshmi, in Hinduism, is the wife of Vishna.
AA11755204	God doesn't exist.  Christians are hard on themselves beyond having to be hard on themselves.  Guilt is one of the more powerful tools of religion.  Religion gains and keeps converts through emotional manipulation.  They do this through threats of Hell, promises of Heaven, pity over martyrs, emotional binding among converts, and enmity towards non-believers.  They also use guilt over not being able to follow impossible rules.  If they can make people feel bad enough about being human, they can keep those people coming back to the pews begging to be forgiven.|`|76d37e4e82379f4203f917df5b9080dcaa	Only two types of peeps, the children of the faith in Jesus, or the children of the law, and they are a law unto themselves, Jesus said we are to reach for the high calling of the mark of Jesus Christ, so cont. to progress...|`|7559b813a98c150ef5b45122ecdbef0aaa	Well said|`|AA10859773	Anyone who wouldn't admit even to themselves that they're a work in progress are delusional.    I don't buy into christians being harder on themselves.  That's a sad sad quality that has nothing to do with religion.|`|fc3016dfe047e8337e1204e282b3c398aa	Yes, life is a continual work in progress, although my aims are probably a little different than yours. You aim to please God, I aim to promote human dignity and flourishing, not because of fear of hell, but because of rationality.|`|b8f23477ee549c6f05b2f18db89c4388aa	First of all. Religion is not but mankind's efforts to reach God. Whereas, Christianity is God's efforts to reach mankind.     It is true we are a work in progress. As you said; we are not perfect, just forgiven. There is two types of sinners. The forgiven and the non-forgiven.     The wonders and the joy of the forgiven, is that the renovation is not completed. But, the maker has still moved in.     http://gospel-wings-of-an-eagle4.com/Hem...|`|3uYAUr1jaa	If a building took as long to complete, they'd fire the workers and hire new ones. They say "I'm a work in progress" whenever anybody catches them and calls them on their bullsh*t, the rest of the time they go around judging everybody else's "sinful behavior". That's pretty cowardly if you ask me.|`|AA10550142	I am most certainly a work in progress.  If I ever stop trying to better myself, I shall have stopped living.    Who do I aim to please most?  Well, me.  One thing that makes me happy is making my loved ones happy- so I also aim to please my lovers, friends, teachers and students.|`|f132cbb00041baab410a089ee4cd5544aa	Since atheists do not believe in the existence of even a perfect higher being, what makes you think they would claim themselves to be perfect and incapable of improvement?    If anything, the "not perfect, just saved" Christian BS is less of an incentive to change than the atheist view.  If you've already been saved and only need to believe and ask forgiveness for your screwups, you can screw up as much as you want, over and over, and still be fine as long as you continually ask for forgiveness, right?    Not much of an incentive to get better, if you ask me.

Everyone has the potential for seeing ghosts/spirits.|`|1xMTNTgkaa	You are probably NOT crazy. You have a psychic ability. It may only be you can sense a spirit when the energy of that spirit is very strong and/or it opens itself to you- sensing you have an ability.  Don't beat yourself up about it. You have to live with it I am afraid. In my family we have too. And I know it is not easy. At least I can talk to my family about it well, except my Dad. He thinks we are all crazy on my Mom's side of the family and his kids. You may get some of that here too. But you can always come here if you need to talk or have a question because there are others like you. As well as very open minded people.  Be Well & Best Wishes.|`|QqOUVukfaa	You can see Dead ppl.  And so can i, every time i see a mirror as i am Vampire! ya ha ha ha ha ha.....|`|GROkWyBAaa	Neither, you just believe what you saw. However, just because you saw something, doesn't always mean it's there. I wouldn't blame you for believing in ghosts if you think you saw them, but the truth is, they really don't exist.|`|2LlC6AWHaa	no. it just looked like it|`|jard50Yiaa	I would advise speaking to a priest or minister about this phenomena...|`|ktGVsHOsaa	u can see them. thats pretty cool but scary|`|BiprMZQlaa	u probebly have an albino stalker who u only every see from a distance|`|8k6kxOh2aa	although many people would tell you so, you're not mad, and you are surely not the only person who has these experienced. i, myself and one of my best friends have seen spirits on several occasions, and many times we see the same ones. this is my proof that they are real. we described them to each other to to make sure we were correct. you are not bad. you just have a gift that many don't believe, but deep down would like to possess.  ~stardriven09|`|JI4pim1Eaa	Lunatic You Mean?   You believe you see ghosts on 3 separate occasions...  I believe I saw a white man in my mash potatoes and thought it was Jesus. But wait, Jesus was never white.  Hey lookie that.|`|P5Pjjy26aa	Some people are more perceptive to the spirit world. They can use the organ of perception*, the intuition part of the brain. Some speculate that humans used to all be intuitive, but with the development of technology human thought became rational and lost their intuition (ability to sense/"know" things...). But, it is still a part of us, and some people have it more than others.   So, yeah maybe you can see dead people...|`|8g4ccn5maa	Just because we don't fully understand something does not mean that it does not exist.  We may have faulty perception.  I personally had 3 encounters with a lady ghost.  I was an extreme unbeliever until then.  I don't know the scientific explanation for their existence but just because I don't understand that it doesn't mean I didn't have the encounters.  This happened in the old farm house in which I lived at the time.    I would not say that you are mad.

If the straight people who are making you feel uncomfortable at parties are really your "friends", would it be possible for you to come out to them?  Then you could bring your own dates to parties and have more fun.    ...Or (and read this part only if you have a devious streak like I do)...  Don't come out of the closet.  Or come out, but only to the few people you are comfortable telling.  Find a department store, a beauty supply store, and an adult store.  Buy all the supplies you need to dress your date of choice up as a member of your opposite sex.  Pick your date up two or three hours before party time and give him a good "makeover".  Hmmm...  maybe you should practice a few times before the actual party, just to make sure it doesn't look funky.  Then go to the party as a straight couple, have fun, and fool them all!

So I'd say yes, I would. It'd be kind of kinky. In a good way.  I was always sexually adventurous and it would add another dimension to an already satisfying history.|`|2f0ca23a25326318e27b4a573d435ed7aa	I always wanted to suck myself, unfortunately could not bend that much.  Yes I would have sex with myself.  It would be one interesting sexual experience.  And if I don't get satisfied I only have myself to blame and no one else :-D|`|2c858f0feb65575b418c41082f94a70caa	I wouldnt have sex with myself (I could do that now and do!)  but i would warn 'me' not to have sex with a few of the loosers that I did have sex with!|`|91acf4dec3b907fa1dddca164a816d32aa	There are some thing I like to be done for me, and some things that I like to do; since the two do not overlap too much, I wouldn't not do it with myself; but I would tell myself to come out sooner because you only have one life and it is best to live it and not worry about what others think.|`|bedbf9c1bef28b322c12f84157f249d1aa	I wouldn't have sex with myself.

Great Question though makes you think about it even from a hetro prospective if you met your mate in the past would you do it, would that be cheating on yourself?  who knows.|`|03f9ddb95b8418547390d190a9003776aa	yes, i do now. who doesn't have sex with them selves.|`|AA10104590	honestly i'm not a lesbian i would tell myself not to do so much stupid ****. i believe only the most conceded would, however factoring in you gay and lesbian community it would involve vanity but i also think theyd want to see how good or talented erotically they are. that would be a good national survay would you engage in erotic activities with your self from the past. i believe everybody self endulges time to time if you do and are not sickend by it you may engae in sex with yourself from the past. nevertheless does anywon really know if they would when it came right down to it. its sick because it is infact incest and homosexual so how many really would at that time go thru with it.|`|AA11873787	i don't think I would.  I know that it would not like being gay but more like masturbation but I'm really not into guys. I think i would rather go back to some of the girls that i did in my 20's and see if I would let me switch off with a few them.  I banged a few really hot chicks in the past.|`|AA11078313	No, I wouldn't.  But I would tell myself the outcomes of all the relationships I had tried, and tactics I had used in those relationships.  Who knows, maybe I could save myself some heartbreak and get laid a little more often.|`|9990aeccebda7d6c27fe81ef0733dfc1aa	The concept was also explored in a book called, The Man Who Folded Himself.

4b0017b6f1d17e1bc52f602c5a3f0a30aa	I heard that there is a new religion call Foxy-logy. Those that embrace the religion will have a mind of a cunning fox and therefore can overcome the wicked of this world. They do not take 10% of your hard earnings and they prohibit Lesbian or Homo to be on the Ministerial post however they can be accepted as ordinary members.     I must find out more as I am delusion of the Christian Church that preach one thing and does the opposite. At least at the end of the month I have extra 10% to spend.    I am sick of being a laugh at and is so mad that all this while I have been taken on a ride.

f3d815c6912b77829c64f51860516c85aa	Hugs and Kisses is a term for a sequence of the letters X and O, e.g. XOXO, typically used to express affection or good friendship at the end of a written letter or email.    It is debatable which letter represents which act. Some interpret X as the crossed arms of a hug and O as the puckered lips of a kiss. However, the interpretation assumed in the following, in which X represents the four lips of a kiss and O the four arms of a hug, is more common. For example the Oxford English Dictionary states that X is "used to represent a kiss, esp. in the subscription to a letter." [1]    Additionally, there is a more simple interpretation, based on the pronunciation of the letters X (sounds like 'kiss') and O (sounds like 'hold', as in 'I hold you').    The use of XOXO goes back to the use of an X or cross, which was considered as good as a sworn oath in times before most people could write and therefore used the X in the same way a signature is used today  a mark of one's word.    An X at the end of a letter or document was often kissed as a seal of honesty, in much the same way one would kiss a Bible or kiss the fingers after making the sign of the Christian cross, thus the X came to represent a kiss in modern times.    The "X " was the ancient Paleo Hebrew letter Tav, and was a symbol of the Seal of Hashem (God) and it represented truth, completeness, and perfection.    The origins of the O as a hug are not generally known, although it is speculated that it may represent the arms wrapped around someone being hugged. .    ... or both persons with fore arms clasped in a non intimate yet friendly embrace forming the shape of a circle.    And there you have it...|`|d23fbebfe52a653975838d71cdb6c0e7aa	X is for hugs and O for kisses.|`|IwHLNqwmaa	They must have originatedfrom some internet freak that is lazy to type 'Hugs and Kisses' but the 'X's should be kisses and the 'O's shoud be hugs.|`|AA12048010	Os are hugs, which seems appropriate if you can envision it as and encircling embrace.  Xs are kisses - I think I heard a story that that started because of the sign of the cross and kissing it in church history, but I don't remember well enough to cite it.|`|aeb50a1352b19cb8d52140f1b33cee8baa	Hmm.. I've always thought X to be the kiss but upon seeing this question, I've decided X is the hug.    X looks like a person with arms extended and legs braced to hug a person. I mean you stand with legs apart to hug people not stand stick straight with legs sticking together. The O is like the shape of your mouth when you sorta pout it to kiss someone.    XOXO|`|V9NzKKRvaa	X's cross and embrace. Your mouth is hopefully the circle.|`|AA11215767	X = kiss, O = hug|`|sQEMFUcgaa	O's are hugs. Your arms are in a big circle.  X's are kisses.

AA10550142	Hello dear.  Yes there are Satanists out there- there are even a few here on Y!A.    I am one.    Do we believe in God?  Most Satanists do not believe in God or even in Satan.  The most essential elements of our philosophy do not require spiritual belief in anything but ourselves.    Are we scared of (punishment for) what we're doing?  No no.  Quite the opposite.  Satanism is a hedonistic religion.  Verily I say to you we are rewarded in full each day.    Do we have powers?  Because we are not fettered to the service of a God that demands sacrifice of carnal pleasures, because we are not destined to "turn the other cheek", because we make decisions by ourselves and for ourselves- the answer is yes.    We are powerful.  Knowledge, freedom, action- these are the keys to our power, and we can wield it to great effect.    Of course, you probably meant to ask about the practice of magick.  Yes indeed, some of us do practice magick, with various levels of success I'm sure.    No, dear, we are not scared of what we're doing.  We leave the task of fearing God to Christians.|`|cbad8edaefc1b364a11f1395634f60a0aa	You don't know much about Satanism, do you?|`|2ce748ba96d2eff2b0664ddf883b02eeaa	Here here.

A temple dedicated to him is believed to be lost and buried in the sands of Egypt south of Siwa.

People whom are judgeing others saying they will go to hell , are the one s whom them self I Promise will See Hell.       Think of this:          A Lord of a large land, has hundreds of people living on his land.    One day, he leaves the land  to go on a trip.   He doesn't tell anyone, and he doesn't leave Anybody in charge, because everyone is His son or daughter.           During his absence, some people get worried, and begin to fear that if others do not do as They think they should, Then , when there Father returns, He will be angery.           So , these people who are worrying , become leaders, and try and lead the folk of the land to follow the rules that the leaders state.    And for those who do Not listen nor follow them, the leaders throw them off the land into the wild.         Then , one day, there Father, the Lord of the land, Returns.  And noticeing that some of His children are missing, he asks around and finds out what happened.        Within a moment, he is face to face with the leaders, and asks them why they sent forth some of His children.      Responding to Him, the leaders reply that they were doing it For Him.          Yet with this, the Father answers with Great anger saying" You did Nothing for Me !   You have sent forth MY children , Whom I LOVE!   They are Now Lost in the Darkness .    And you sent them forth in MY NAME !!!   "         Then , the Father got more angery," For this, YOU shall receive the Same Punishment that you gave my children.  "     With that , the leaders and all whom followed them, were sent forth from the Lord s Land.  Into the Darkness.      Woe to Those whom lose the children of God, For They SHALL see Hell.|`|3de2399999c4d98b0393e8255a669d92aa	And watch out for those black helicopters, too - they could be lurking...|`|AA11968156	......what?    so whats your question?|`|e5a6c2cf500f142b868ffea08be0fa03aa	sorcery is the object of satanic forces, luring the young and stupid into the realms of eternal hell.

Conjuring.     All of these are instruments and devices that takes the focus away from God who is the source of all truth and knowledge. The source of these things is the devil who has great power to deceive and lure and tempt.    It is written in the scriptures that Satan has power over armies and nations, able to conjure storms, cause disease and famine and plagues. He can mimic the miracles of God, as seen with Moses's confrontation with the pharoah's magicians.     He will set up priestcrafts and false religions to deceive and corrupt and lure the minds and souls of man away from the truths of God.     That is why he condemns them.|`|b3a66ad190d23b6cc72e2dd18c2ccf53aa	To judge others is to disrespect God, no matter how one looks at it. God would not judge or condemn that which he has created, and since he created Man and Man created sorcery, does that not in a way make sorcery a creation of God and not just some occult fantasy? True, there are some darker magicks in the world if you believe them to be real, but God created the entire world and all that is in it, both good and bad - the bad is simply a test of our ability to distinguish between the two. Judgement of others is as much a sin as the occult, if not moreso, as that judgement comes from a closed mind and heart that would rather refuse to learn than accept what is. Besides, without darkness, how would we appreciate light?|`|90b77bbefba2eb318173c23604ffe4d2aa	It was spoken against in the OT because most who practiced it did not give God the credit for the power. Also there were as many fakes then as now leading people astray for money. The early Christian church was against it because it was a rival religion. Also it is condemned because it is dangerous in that while the practice is not evil in itself,  the power can mislead a person to grandiose thoughts and to the dark side. When one gives over ones will to God and sees God as the source of all, that is safer. The lure to use the powers of the universe for ones own selfish reason is very great, and I think that this is the main reason that sorcery is condemned. I am sure that Jesus was tempted in this way as well, but he did not give in to it, and in all things He acknowledged that the power was the power of God and it was through God that he was doing the things that He did.|`|fc56fa4454a7766412e151edc45f7483aa	Very interesting!

2d13e33aace4b93da391ed5a818034c2aa	The authority that you seek is the Bible.    There is no communication between us and those that have died - that is a primary definition of death, cessation of communication.    Attempted communication is forbidden since it very likely will bring you into deception and bondage from which you are unlikely to escape.    The redeemed , at death, go into the presence of God and in His safe keeping. For them, old things have passed away and all is new.    The remainder are kept in custody until the day of judgement. They will not be at rest since their uncleansed consciences will no longer be dulled by the flesh and will come fully alive.  An awful and most terrible condition since there will no longer be any opportunity for the conscience to be quieted nor for forgiveness to be applied.  The state we are in at death is fixed or sealed by death, the sprit being parted from the body remains in that state in which it was at the moment it is parted. The things we can see are temporal but spiritual things are eternal.     Since God is all seeing as you rightly state, and all knowing, seek Him for your answers and for your wellbeing for He is also all goodness and all mercy and has done all and can do no more for us than what He already has.    As to your  wife, as you say, do not fret,  for God does many wonderful and surprising things and has all things in His hand and has ways that are past our finding out, and who knows what He may have done or be doing?    But as for you, therfore, do not frustrate the goodness of God but seek Him for yourself and for your answers. Taste and see that the Lord is good, blessed is the man that trusts in Him.|`|AA11907063	ROFL|`|b69eae1af2f0ccd6b0b7f4e575eee38caa	You mean.. as opposed to those religious people that HAVE died.

Monarchies do not cost any more to maintain than presidents, and often a good deal less.  The President of Italy for example costs almost twice as much as the British royal family to keep.

b8e196946a33b64918a5f00f8f53ab72aa	I've heard it's upwards of 300 lbs, but that may have changed.  Why would you want to do something this horrible to yourself or to the social security system?  There are lots of people out there who have disabilities that they didn't choose to have who need it more than you do.  They'd give anything to be able to work, but they can't and then people come along and say, "Hey, that's a pretty good deal!  What do I have to do to cripple myself?"  I have several friends and relatives on SSI and it is not a lot of money and it's dehumanizing.  You would have to deal with an overworked government employee constantly, and chances are, that employee is going to hate disabled people with a passion.  Of course, this is assuming you could even get on social security in the first place.    My father-in-law weighs 340 lbs. (no, he didn't gain it on purpose or from being lazy--it was a medication problem that messed up his metabolism), has fibromyalgia (very painful, no cure), can't work and keeps getting turned down for disability.  He's one of the people that needs it, but because of people who take advantage of the system, he can't get it.    No, you should not "go for it".  You'll end up hurting yourself for a measly $850 a month or worse, keep getting turned down and end up destitute and with a shattered health.    btw, I hate to have to tell you this, but according to the dictionary (see link below) you ARE lazy.

(@  Kroger, every hudred bucks u spend in store will knock off 10cent per gallon in gas every time u frequent their gas stations)    haircuts- try places like Great Clips or Hair Cuttery. Another place is beauty schools, they offer discounted services and are supervised by licensed teachers.    hope this helps|`|gjZc61E7aa	Yes-make sure you always put 1/3rd of your income in the bank,and spend the other 2/3.You'll always have a good amount of savings then!It builds up really quickly!|`|9ea5e8dd576fe0621bb8f8f8c17c8e7baa	Hi Simon,     Thats great news!

44xFv2k3aa	Most of the time you are not allowed to touch the private parts on a dancer, but you may be able to touch her legs.  You are sick if you are gonna come during a lap dance but I know many boys guys and men have done it.  As far as tips go, she is a dancer and she will try to make you tip her as much as you can.  You sound too young and immature to be going to strip clubs but i guess everyone has to start somewhere.|`|AA12289772	Etiquette ?  Release what ?|`|cSgIRFnsaa	It's all about how you go about it. Technically you're not supposed to but if done with the right attitude most strippers love it. I touch them all the time and hardly ever have a problem. If they do tell me no though, I respect that. As far as releasing... I wouldn't try that in the strip club. Let it build, then go out to your car and take care of business!

Just kidding  I believe the only one is you can't touch  Oh and TIP MISTER  They are not up there for fun....|`|a4fe19effebb429c7e610f8392e17703aa	First of all, release is NOT OK at a strip club, so forget it.  Unless you want to wait until she's done and take care of it in a private stall (by yourself) in the bathroom.  releasing during a lap dance is a good way to get the crap beat out of you by the dancer, the  bouncer, or most likely, both.      Lap dances generally are around $20.  What you get for that depends on the club and the state/city laws.  You don't have to tip, but if you want her too keep dancing multiple dances for you, it might be a good idea.  The guy who pays the most generally gets the most attention, and if she knows there's someone else who will compensate her better for her time, she'll drop you and go get him.  a few extra dollars (3-5) per dance would be a reasonable tip, on top of the $20 per song.  Some places, no touching is allowed at all.  Some places, it's one way- she can touch you (anywhere but groin) but you can't touch her.  Sometimes, they're allowed to "grind" on you, but with her underwear on and you fully dressed.  Ask the girl you're interested in what the rules are.  Whatever you do, don't just figure you'll touch and see if you can get away with it.  The girls there are used to people trying that and often have no patience for it, in which case, you can expect a kick to the groin and an embarrassing exit, courtesy of a bouncer.    If "release" is what you're looking for, you might be better off checking adult listings for a "massuese" who provides "happy endings."  But that will run you a lot more, anywhere from $80- $200, probably between $100-150.|`|aeb50a1352b19cb8d52140f1b33cee8baa	Place you money in front of you. You do not touch her at anytime. She will touch/release you. Tuck the money into whatever place she offers you to.

Lamentablemente cuando alguien se refiere a un pas por su nombre, en conjunto engloba a todos sus habitantes, quienes forman parte de la nacin y toman decisiones sobre las acciones de su gobierno.    No tenga nada en contra de los chilenos pero si en contra de su estado o de las acciones que ha tomado su estado en el pasado, por eso cuando a veces veo a un chileno hablando de "que atrasados son los peruanos y bolivianos" o "los argentinos se nos quieren copiar" y habla de las maravillas de su pas es que no sabe como las cosas han llegado a ese punto y como es que terminaron de esa manera. As cuando se analiza la historia uno se entera del juego poltico chileno hizo fracasar la alianza peruano-boliviana instigando a argentina a que se ponga de su lado, a como Chile gan una guerra contra un solo pas, dada la inexistente marina boliviana y la inocua y muy corta ayuda militar boliviana, en crisis econmica, con deudas externas y con la ventaja de haberse preparado por 10 para la guerra y con supervicin y armamento ingls; all uno se da cuenta de como son las cosas en realidad y no comprende como alguien siente orgullo y se siente por encima de otro que venci con tan franca desventaja y de forma desleal.    Ni hablar del caso argentino donde en toda falta de respeto entre paises vecinos chile presta servicios a Inglaterra para que estos puedan desembarcar y atacar Argentina, teniendo Argentinas grandes posibilidades de vencer a los Ingleses.    Estas son acciones que la gente (sobre todo muchos que las vivieron) no pueden olvidar porque sus consecuencias se siguen sintiendo hoiy en da, nadie puede olvidar la historia ni a quienes la orquestan.

Cuando se nace y se es ni?o, adolescente o dependiente, uno tiene que estar sometido a las reglas de quien manda en el hogar.  Cuando sales del seno familiar, te ligas responsabilidades distintas, como trabajo, donde hay dependencia laboral, o una responsabilidad que impide ser libre en ese sentido.  Los hijos son una atadura, que te hace estar en casa cuidndolos o trabajando para mantenerlos...la vejez de los padres, etc.  Un sistema de gobierno, en el cual debes pedir permiso para salir del pas, debes solicitar partidas de nacimiento, sujetarte a un control, mediante un nmero de cdula, estudios, trabajo, cuestiones de salud, etc.  En total conclusin, la relatividad de la libertad est medida en funcin de la labor  que desempe?as en la comunidad.|`|k7he7A80aa	S, t y cualquiera puede llegar a ser libre.    ?como?

Creo somo esclavos de muchas cosas, de muchos prejuicios, de cosas banales, del cuerpo, a nivel sexual. somos esclavos hasta de la comida. La idea es romber los lazos de la sociedad y concentrarnos en nosotros mismos, intentar ser due?os de nosotros, pero primero debemos desprendernos de la sociedad, el problema e q entre mas creemos q nos acercamos a ser libres, mas nos damos cuenta de lo sometidos q estamos a l sistema. Debo decir, q lo mas grave de todo no es ser esclavo de la sociedad, sino q somos esclavos de nosotros mismos, de nuestros pensamientos y hechos, asi q creo q la unica manera de ser libre, es borrar todolo q sabemos del mundo hasta, y empezar de cero.

Amma did have a good 64 year marriage, but I wish I had asked her what exactly she meant. I think it meant that she's a virgin. Amma would never have said that word.|`|acaJSqW6aa	I call them single.

"Spinster", but I don't know the male equivalent.|`|2AXwOgdQaa	I imagine that with more sexual freedom that unfortunate name finally died out.  Some "Old Maids" were just about the most splendid people you could ever hope to find!  They devoted their lives to looking after ageing parents, while other more selfish, or single-minded  family members avoided what they saw as a trap and thus managed to slip away in search of just good Free-living,or University studies, or a job, or  marriage and children.|`|F3nlVXJ5aa	you're right.  The phrase "old maid" went out in the 1950's but not only did it mean the woman was older (not a senior citizen) but also she was taking care of a parent who was disabled and at home or bedridden.    I've never heard a word for a woman today who is single past the age (what age would that be now that people get married later in life?) of what used to be a certain age that women married (21).  Why does there have to be a "name" for everything?    I'd often wondered if the reason some women didn't marry was because they used to say that every household that had a woman go off to the nummery was blessed.  Maybe staying single was her way of providing blessings to her parents.  Or, because there were stillborns and dissentary and deaths from flu or other things where children didn't live long or the women died in childbirth maybe those single women knew something ran in their dna that they would lose children so they never tried, and back then women were disowned by their family if they had children out of wedlock.|`|2liwk8yKaa	Have not heard this expression for years other than as a game of cards.I just thought they were called a Spinster.|`|bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	I am not really sure who "they" are. I, for one, still call an unmarried woman who has reached the age of fifty or so an " Old Maid ". A man of like years in my book is a "Bachelor" or perhaps a " Confirmed Bachelor". Perhaps I am a person that did not leave earlier times and earlier thinking and remained as it was. If that is true I am proud of the same. Things are more simple and easier understood than today with all of the variances and  nuances that seem to cloud  clear thinking. Appropriateness and dignified are over rated, I believe. Perhaps even misunderstood.

We had an apartment on the 4th floor.|`|VWAl3tcnaa	I most definitely did unbeknown to us the lady across the street witnessed my effort and accomplishment.  Luckily for me my spouse was not overweight.|`|5n3Wm0LGaa	yes.    He did it at the hotel to our honeymoon suite.    and I think he did it at our home when we got back, too.|`|7fHsyHYraa	Nope.  We kind of hustled through the door together.  I'm not sure if he could have picked me up and carried me even if he had wanted to.  He was young and strong but I weighed about 150 and he probably wasn't much heavier himself.|`|AA11570788	Yes, he did. He picked me up and carried me through the door to our (what had been his) apartment. I weighed a lot less then.  He couldn't pick me up now.|`|KBxz1Wfyaa	Don't ya just love Yahoo's logic sometimes? hee hee.  In answer to your question, the first time no.  He got very drunk at the reception and I practically carried him into the house that day.  Guess that should have been my first clue.  The second time he carried me over the threshold into 3 hotel rooms on our honeymoon and again when we got back home.  This was no small feat because he probably weighed in at 135 lbs soaking wet with a rock in his pocket and I weighed 115 lbs.  No wonder he has back problems now.  Loved your question!|`|XhwxmP7vaa	no..guess it won't ever happen..|`|AA10240238	Sort of  He picked me up but my dress was slippery   so it was like he threw me over.  *G*|`|2liwk8yKaa	Love the Taxes bit.

Love that Yahoo, and its ideas of where a question should belong.  No rhyme nor reason to it!.    No, he didn't carry me over the threshold.  After the small reception, we stopped at my Mom's.

AA10684791	I believe that everyone is beautifull but beauty is categorized by cultural norms. Inner beauty is to be sweet, loving, honest and otherwise virtuous but that should be coupled with making one's flesh as good as it can be also as far as avoiding gluttony, grooming, exercise, cleanliness and nice clothing. If one is beautiful inside, it will be reflected outside as well. If not perceptible to the eye, still seen in the smile, heard in the voice and felt during interaction with the being.|`|AA11957106	Yes I believe in inner beauty, but I'm terrible at living that way.  Inner beauty tugs at your heart strings while outer beauty GRABS you by the crotch.   I have lived and loved quite a number of years and loved both ways. Both had their high points and lows.  "What would you consider to be beautiful?"  I am the Father of a 19 year old son and most of my world is now Him. Beautiful is still the sound of his laughter.|`|a82df4035357599e503c2c87ac02d52eaa	In terms of beautiful women - It is largely a matter of accepting themselves as they are and making it work for them.    I have seen so many women look beautiful in so many ways.  The ones that did not look beautiful were the ones who tried to make themselves look like something they were not.    So my advice is use what you've got... don't worry about the imperfections - if you show off the good bits no-one will notice the rest.|`|15a987215850686bdd3732c4320beb4baa	beauty is a thing which gives cheerfulness or makes one happy..this the reason why ppl appreciate beauty..i do believe in the "inside beauty"..becoz evry man or woman is consisted of beauty...outside beauty is just a layer of trash...                                              Beauty is art and colour...evry single thing is considered beautiful becoz it is of art and colour..|`|d5d02c71bb7de74e13c59b7b89e9c7ceaa	To enjoy beauty you have to know what ugly is. To know what is light, you should know the darkness. All are exactly opposite.  If you know hatred then you can fully enjoy the LOVE.  so the beauty is only internal not external. Also it should have spirit or energy in it. How long you can admire a beautiful girl but died. So first it should be live . Even ugly you can feel more beauty rather than a dead beautiful thing.|`|e4ea78f84797a325a8f09288df4483a4aa	Your looks don't last forever so beauty on the inside is important.|`|AA11445457	inside darlin.. don't judge a book by it's cover.. beauty is  within not outside ..this is only my opinion OK :~)|`|370f3f9e5beb96552b4303955093a206aa	Actually beauty is an illusion much as life is. Everyone thinks that our lives are controllable with actions ..but life is as a dream.You dream that you are attacked by a wild animal only to wake and find that you are just dreaming..Life is much like that ..its all illusion and why try to control something with action if its a dream ..You can control it with your mind.. so why bother worry what is beauty or not beauty its all in your mind..

I have dreams about 2 deceased relatives who talk to me and warn me of things.  When I was a kid we lived in a haunted house where strange things would happen, like doors slamming, footstep noises, etc.  This one time the living room became so cold for so long that my fish tank froze solid.  It was Florida and it was like 80 degrees outside.  I remember chipping away at the ice with a butter knife to get the fish out and I fed them to the cat.  I know, morbid, but true.  I was only like 7 years old.

AA10550142	Who knows what sort of magick she weaved into those things.  Magick is a very personal thing, and nothing you describe sounds particularly sinister.

The straw box and the feather indicate that the need was outward. the string on the feather is the person wanting the spirit guide, in this case a bird to search out and bring back the desired answer. Blue is for peace and dreams. Woven bark and $,,, not sure.  the money could be some kind of offering or a desire to send money to someone.    Why the interest?|`|82ec2ba801908cf29d8d892adb54d45aaa	I would have to agree.

So please Don't mess with it bury it.

Sura1 Ra'd  13:7    The aborgine of South Australia calls his God "Atnatu" because some philosopher, poet or prophet had programmed him, that the Father in Heaven is absolutely free from all needs; He is independant; He needs no food nor drink. This quality, in his primitive, un-inhibited language, he conversely named ATNATU, which literally meant "the One without an anus - the One without any flaw" - i.e. the One from Whom no impurity flows or emanates.  The one who eats, must have the call of nature - the toilet or the bush - and our primitive friend smelt the need, which he could never attribute to his Creator. Therefore, he called his God - ATNATU!

So the world and human race was put into motion by man falling away from God to the woman, which brought into place the sex drive and the human race.  That's why Jesus said in the new life man and woman would not marry, they would be like the angels, sexless.  That's why God's seed, not man's, made a perfect son for the true atonement.    The imperfect fall of man through the woman via the devil was part of the perfect plan.

God says to Eve, "How are things going for my favorite creation?"  Eve responds, "Oh God, everything is wonderful!  I only have one complaint."  "Oh, what is that Eve," God asks.  "It's these three boobs you gave me.  The one in the middle pushes the two at the sides out and I keep catching them on everything."  God thinks for a minute and says, "I see your point.  You were my first attempt at a human and I see now that you will do fine with only two."  So God reaches over grabs the middle boob, pulls it off and tosses it over his shoulder into some bushes.      A few weeks later, God and Eve are walking through the garden, and God asks Eve, "How are things going Eve?"  Eve responds, "Everything is wonderful God, I only have one complaint."  "Oh," God asks, "What is that?"  Eve responds, "I am lonely and have no one to talk to."  "I see what you mean.  I will make you a mate to keep you company."  Looking around God asks, "Now what did I do with that worthless boob?"      NOW, that would have changed the status of the sexes!

BUT I believe there are as many white criminals as black criminals.|`|p8Mc6rpBaa	Here is my answer to a similar question:    Since we are talking about Black people in high concentration let's look at the West African nation of Ghana. There are 23 million Black people in Ghana. That is 2/3 the population of Black people in the USA that inhabit a land area a little less than the state of Arizona. According to statistic taking by INTERPOL in the areas of felony crimes such as murder, rape and drug trafficking the number show less that 3 cases per 100,000 people. What this means is the felony crime rate among the Black people in Ghana is less than a minute fraction of 1%. The statistics for misdemeanor crimes such as theft the nation crime rate was .08%. There are other statistics as well. One of the most telling observation made by INTERPOL was that based upon statistics Ghana statistically has a very low crime rate for an industrialized nation. The highest would be the USA.       The major difference I would like to point out is Ghana is a nation of vast majority Black people that is governed by it's own people. In the USA Black people represent the second largest minority group at 12% of the US population in a country ruled by a majority White sociopolitical system. In Ghana Black people know their heritage and racial identity dating back 1000's of years. In America Black people have a racial identity that only dates back 500 years. My point is high crime percentages among Black people seem to only occur when they are a minority ruled by nations where White people are the majority.       I pointed this out to illustrate statistically that nations populated and governed by Black people have low crime rates. It is only when Black people live in nations governed by White people that crime among Black people reaches comparatively high levels. Therefore it is safe to say that White people have a negative affect on Black people...Statistically speaking that is...  |`|398p9O07aa	Because they are going by sterotypes and what america has made to believe throught the years....      ----  notice that all the answer saying things like "this is just a steortype pople think" or somthing similar to that, are the ones that get thumbs down.

Learn statistics and use them correctly and fairly    You should follow your own advice.  According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports, blacks commit more than their share of white collar crimes, too.  They're 13% of the population, but commit more than 13% of white collar crimes.    >For instance, lots of people use statistics to 'prove' blacks commit more crimes than whites. However, their argument is flawed because they only look at the crimes blacks typically commit.    It's a matter of importance.  Although blacks commit more than their share of white collar crimes, they're not mentioned because those crimes are not on a high level of importance.  There's no violence involved, nobody's physically hurt, nobody's killed.  So we look at things like murder (blacks committed over 50% of all US murders in 2006, and over 49% in 2007), rapes, robberies, assaults, and things of that nature.

While you are focused on the action on TV, their corporate bedfellows will rob your 401K, stock options and bank accounts blind.      Here's a crude illustration I have created to make it clear on the crime in America.      Say you have 100 people...      60 are White people  15 are Latino people  12 are Black people  8 are Asian people  5 are Jewish people  ___________  100 people    Are all of the Black people committing crime?  No.  Lets say HALF, which is highly exaggerated, are committing crime...take that number for the other ethnicities, too.    IF HALF OF EACH ETHNICITY WAS A CRIMINAL REGARDLESS OF CRIME COMMITTED...    30 White criminals  7.5 Latino criminals  6 Black criminals  4 Asian criminals  2.5 Jewish criminals  _______________  50 criminals    Even if only about 1 in 8 White people committed crime, it is still more in numbers than half of each individual non-White ethnic populations...    IF 1/4th OF EACH ETHNICITY WAS A CRIMINAL...    15 White criminals out of 60 Whites  4 Latino criminals out of 16 Latinos  3 Black criminals out of 12 Blacks  2 Asian criminals out of 8 Asians  1 Jewish criminals out of 5 Jews  __________________  about 25 criminals out of 100 people      CONCLUSION: Logically speaking, there will always be 3 times more White criminals...or 60% of all criminals are White...but then not all things are equal.  One could argue that Latinos are 4 times more and Blacks are 5 times more likely to be ARRESTED by police...its not always what has been done, but what can be proven.  Its a general belief that cops, regardless of their own personal racial lines, are prejudiced.    It would be interesting to find out what is the racial makeup, in terms of %, compose the police forces of the United States.

Anthropological scientists categorize humans into 3 races (caucasoid, mongoloid, & *******).    Don't forget that Hawaii is a US state--many americans(non-polynesian) that moved there don't claim 2 be hawaiian.     Anyway, yes, Hawaiians are of the Mongoloid race. You can call them Asian bec Polynesia is in Asia (in the Pacific Ocean)--but when you use the word Asia (or Asian) you are talking about a LOCATION in general.|`|01b248bc3994e56ef4d896406f7138afaa	polynesian|`|wcuDImazaa	pacific islander....you got the spelling wrong...it is hawaiian not hawiian

There was actually mass hysteria about it. There were so called trials but most (surprisingly not all) were convicted and sentenced to death. Some people actually came to believe that they themselves were actually witches, which didnt help their case. Luckily they stopped the torturing and killing, but some (even today) believe that people such as psychics use witchcraft. |`|2J68w7oRaa	Such a practice was there at one time.|`|FsByX9xxaa	yup.  They also used to burn atheists alive too if they refused to convert.  Ya know the Spanish Inquisition.

Zpi63pBsaa	Europeans discuss sex more in public and nudity is a lot more common on tv and in public as well. They embrace the human body as art, unlike in America. The result are lower teenage pregnancies, abortions and rate of stds. They do not make a big  religious deal concerning sex because of the fact that Puritans founded America.    They tell their kids that if they have sex, to do it responsible, hence the better sex education. In America sex is shamed and looked down upon more so than in Europe and even other parts of the world.|`|RpH0i3c3aa	no|`|AA10368751	Yes Europeans are more sexual.  We do have to know the name of the girl before making love.  And no, we don't have any nudity on TV.  Unless cable with pay per view.

And if a revelation comes to someone who is sitting down, the first speaker should stop. For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged. The spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets. For God is not a God of disorder but of peace."    1 Corinthians 14: 29-33    The above verse lays out some guidelines for how a gathering ought to be conducted.  I wanted to share this biblical criteria for conduct at a religious gathering.    If someone came into my service behaving in that way, I would undoubtedly get annoyed and angry.  However, if they were speaking the truth; if I was mistaken and they were in the right, then I suppose I ought to thank them for helping me see the error of my ways.

I believe the old men are looking at you when your showering because it reminds them of their youthful days when they where young, fresh, healthy, and strong.  Looking at you, they see that time is moving past them as they grow old and weak.  They want what you have so they look at you and wish for a healthier life.   Sadly, this is reality and time waits for no man.    Your sight trigger these thoughts and I do not believe the results are always sexual.   Poor old dudes.
b4d182ebaeb01ace50b4f0280b18a44faa	When I first moved in with my husband.  A Pagan in a Conservative Christian area makes for tense neighbors.  =)  I wasn't beat up, threatened (besides the normal "You're going to hell")... but they definitely made it hard to go to the store. lol  And I still get Jesus videos put on my front porch, along with Christian tracts.  It was surprising really... this town isn't that small, but it seems damn near everyone in my immediate neighborhood knows I'm Pagan. lol    And, we had one incident with the public school system over my son wearing a Pagan symbol, claiming that gangs use those symbols.  Yet, census shows that it's the Christian Cross which is used the most, as far as religious symbols.  So, of course, I made sure the local schools knew this.  Nothing else was said about my son wearing a Pagan symbol.    It sucks when it's happening.  But looking back, I'm glad it did happen.  At least I didn't get friendly with these people and then have them slam me.  They were up front about being assholes.|`|29258f3f6c5bf7548bbab17bd203f719aa	Yes.

I know I'm on this list because my sister attended a citizen's academy and they had a seminar on "occult crime" and the woman running the seminar pulled my sister aside afterward and asked her if she was related to me (citing my book). And, everytime the "occult practices" and crime map comes out in the local paper, they have an occult practices symbol in the location where I'm residing.

And I'm a girl! People would lean out the window and yell things out, but we just kept on going and didn't care. Doors slammed in our faces constantly, sometimes so loud and hard and unexpected that it would make us fall back a step. We even had a lady that said she was a witch say she was going to cast a spell or curse on us, i can't remember which, it's been 7 years ago but we weren't even knocking on her door, just walking by. She had to of spotted us out her window walking by. But none of that stuff bothered me or made me sad. It actually made me feel like what I was doing was even more the right thing.

Different religions have different customs here in the USA.  Jews and Muslims must be buried right away.  Jewish men must sit shiva over the dead person during the night.      In the South (where I am from) no matter what faith; after the funeral or burying or memorial service we have a big feast.  Everyone comes and brings food.  When a person dies here all the neighbors and friends and townspeople send food for the bereaved family.    In the South we also have the Irish type "wakes"  sometimes the body of the deceased is brought back to the family home for viewing and the services before burial.|`|AA11263795	You will get so many different answers here your head might just explode. Many do not grieve at all but celebrate the passing of one's soul from this life to the next. Way too many variables. I will check back in a few minutes to see what the answers are you get on this one. It could be fascinating.|`|1429866828ab431509df2707b0df83d3aa	The trouble with answering this question is that Americans are not any one type of people, perhaps it was that way where you are from - a people group that has stayed together in the same place for a long time. Americans are from everywhere on Earth. No one custom or style is the same for everybody.|`|32d480916cc4b91b7d982ba35e734fe7aa	Americans typically plan a funeral which usually takes place within the first 3-7 days when the person dies.  For maybe one or two evenings the person is "laid out" - usually in a casket in a funeral home (a place of business where a mortician prepares the body for burial & transports the body to the cemetary or crematory following the funeral).  The body is then either buried at a cemetery (the family & friends usually travel to the cemetery  watch as the casket is lowered into the ground) or is cremated (burned).  If the person is cremated, the ashes are usually returned to the family according to their wishes.    Americans being from different religious backgrounds, might have different beliefs about what happens to a person when they die.  I can only speak for myself - I am a Christian - I believe that when someone dies their spirit separates from their body & the spirit spends eternity in one of two places - either heaven or hell.  I know & believe this because this is what the Word of God - the Holy Bible - teaches us.  The Bible is God's book of life, or instruction manual to humanity.  God gives us the choice to spend eternity with Him or eternity separated from Him.  If we accept Jesus Christ, who died on the cross for us, as our Lord & Savior & acknowledge Him for who He is, we have the opportunity to experience eternal life in heaven with Him.  If we choose to reject Christ & His sacrificial death, we are not saved from eternity in hell - that's where our spirit will go when we die.|`|6e8571e62767baba8533d685f783b344aa	Good question.  Complicated answer/answers.  Different peoples settled different areas of the US.  The land is also different.  There are also different religions.      I remember my mother being upset because a neighbor insisted upon having her mother's viewing in her house.  Her children had to sleep in that house with the body until the funeral the next day.  It was a common custom in rural America years prior, but not in most of our lifetimes.  Some groups have very elaborate rituals (Irish Catholics) others do modern funerals that may or may not involve religious clergy, but rather show a video of the deceased and have all in attendance share something about the person.  I have seen some ministers do very "fire and brimstone" funerals trying to guilt all in attendance to being saved at the funeral service.  My church does a simple service by family/friends and a dedicatory prayer over the grave to keep the body safe until the Second Coming.  I have known some Jewish people who have to go to synagogue and do a daily prayer for the deceased for an entire year after their death.    Grief varies a lot as well.  Most do not believe in reincarnation.    I do have a suggestion.  Try to visit your local funeral home and ask about the customs of your area.

be0eeaa0579d900b9661f58300533430aa	Read the events that lead to adam and eve induging... Decide for yourselves whose fault was it!      If Adam and eve did not exist... there would not have been any human beings! The first of the species of human beings the revered Adam and Eve were the first to surface on Mother Earth as human beings. Their direct ancestors being the ape family!    Now Adam and Eve came onto this Earth. They had both to act as a family. Both were son and daughter of God. That made them brother and sister. How come they could have fathered children?    In the initial stages of development of human life... nothing existed which we could have called as society or community. It was a raw savage world. As per the theory of Charles Darwin, "it was the time for survival of the fittest". It was the time to do and die.    Words like ethics and morality did not exist for even words did not exist during those times. The Lipi (written form of communication) was developed at a much later stage in time.    Even a brother and sister relationship did not exist at that time. There were only two human beings who had surfaced on Mother Earth. They had to copulate and produce children. They did not do it intentionally. They never knew anything about it.    It was that it happened. They did it and something was born. At that moment of time they would have been extremely surprised not knowing what to do about it. Eventually they would have realized it was one of them.    They reared that child and with passage of time another child was born. This time it was a female child. As this small family progressed further... this male and female child copulated at the appropriate time. And the whole family started to grow.    Now there were two families. With passage of time many more families came into existence. Until this point of time there was nothing like morality and ethics that played any role. For the sake of their survival and progeny these families kept on multiplying.    This was the only way to keep intruders at bay. They had to protect themselves from the wild beings roaming Mother Earth.    Ever since the Revelations of God came into existence... the human being who had invoked these words of God realized that the system had to be ordered at some stage. And some system of morality and ethics came into being.    As of today... the copulation by the children of Adam and Eve was a sin but at that time it was not a sin for the relationship of brother and sister never existed in those times.    The development of relationships in human life came at a very later the stage. It was only possible when the community would have developed into a massive strength. Population somewhere in thousands would have prompted the wise and the elders of those times to separate out into distinct families.    We need to understand that whatever is truth today may not hold tomorrow. In a scientific developing world the values whether they are ethical, moral or otherwise keep changing.

Mostly other gays will live in metropolitan areas just because it's convenient to meet other people there, andthere are many more opportunities and acceptance.      If you're not in a metro area, the best bet is the internet.  I know, it gets old and can be stale, but there are great resources on there.  Instead of going to those traditional websites, like the sleeeeeezy gay.com, try downloading the Stumble Upon toolbar.  Change your preferences to accept "R-rated sites" and then add gay culture as what you'd like to explore.  then click Stumble, and it will take you to random websites to help you explore gay sites and areas.  Many of the sites include non-traditional websites like downelink.com and connexion where you can meet people who are interest in friendship or dating (no hookups).  Other resources would include your local gay newspaper if available.    Of course, there is always waiting until a local pride!  I joined a couple social groups there, and have met a few friends through that.    Try looking for other social groups online.  Sometimes the best way to make new friends is by joining an interest group.  There are sports groups, hiking groups, cooking groups, spiritual groups, etc.    How about enrolling in a class?  There might be something at your local community college that offers classes attuned to gay interests (such as...interior design? haha).      And for my next miracle...I'm going to turn water into funk!

For those Christians who hate the gay community (or anyone else): I suggest you read (as one example from many) Ecclesiastes 7:16    Matthew 5:44 might help you, I suppose, but is perhaps more for those whom you hate to read    And please, please, please, do not start quoting anything at all from the letters of Paul - nothing to do with the message of Christ.

I hear what you are saying and you have a very valid point, because nowhere does the bible say Christians can judge non Christians, bad mouth them and condemn them.     The bible says they are to be Christlike and to be ready to give an answer for the hope that lies within them when they are asked, problem is they do not wait until someone asks them.     The bible says they are to live a blameless life, not sinless because that is impossible, but blameless. Blameless means that they live in such a way that us sinners and unbelievers they preach to all the time cannot honestly find any blame with them. in other words they get to work on time work a full day, don't play games or chess during work hours take only the breaks allowed to them and live lives that put us unbeliever to shame to the point that we will ask them why they are so different.     That is what the bible tells them to do, but judging from your question, these are qualities are not in the Christians you know.     Modern Christians like to live like the devil but tell us we are going to hell and then when we point out their blame, they tell us the bible says judge not lest ye be judged, but fail to understand that Scripture is for Christians not non Christians.|`|AA10334348	If you're a TRUE Christain, you're not supposed to hate anyone.

616fa670a5aad30835b68399d5cb0d9aaa	Ignore the guy who said this is a limerick--it isn't. A limerick is a 5-line poem with an aabba rhyme scheme (like, for example, if the lines ended with old/gold/true/you/cold). The first two and the last line are also longer than the third and fourth lines.    That said, limericks are generally light-hearted/amusing, and your poem does capture that flavor. Your poem is what would be called a standard rhyming poem in tercets with an aab rhyme scheme. Good rhymes, by the way.

Point is, they're out there, lots of them, although they don't get as much of a spotlight as straight transmen.    If I were ever to get a sex change (which I have, briefly, considered), I would totally be a bisexual, but gay-leaning guy, since right now I love masculine pairings of any sort (FtM-FtM, FtM-butch girl, FtM-bio man, butch-butch, butch-bio man, man-man).|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	very uncommon|`|6ac1e229192b9d8283e40e971052ecc5aa	Last I heard a lot do.. transgendered has nothing to do with sexual orientation just how they feel in their bodies|`|8c44939dd30a8db6568f36d75463f666aa	I don't think that it is all that common but I am sure that there are others like you.

I'm FTM, but I'm only into ladies.  I don't think that makes me a straight male or means that I have straight relationships because 1) I've been out in a gay community for years (as a lesbian before considering transitioning) and I wouldn't fit in as a straight person if I tried - even as a male, I'm still a queer.  2) Any girl who would be able to enjoy a pre-op FTM guy would almost certainly have to be bisexual.    I don't like labels really.  Not for myself, and not for my relationships.  Me and a girl don't make a straight couple - we just make a couple of queers.  And by myself, I'm just me.

Occasionally, if I'm wearing a very short skirt for more dressy wear, I'll put on a g-string or thong, but even in the summer I'll frequently go commando under a little sun dress.    If people are hard up enough to look up my dress and like what they see, good for them...I've brought some small pleasure into their life.  If they don't like what they see, well I guess they shouldn't have been looking up there in the first place.|`|ef47e01d653cdf31ffea4a9ef522bad0aa	Commando, are you in the Army......I don't think that you have to wear your uniform when going out|`|9c59d30dd825704972a6d91f93b18277aa	Personally my clothing feel and fits better when I go commando, i.e. without undies LOL.  Depending on whether you are male or female, I would not recommend it for a woman wearing a dress, but otherwise I see no harm in it.  For a woman in a dress, thong underwear is the greatest.  It feels as though you have nothing on, there is generally no panty line and you are protected from leaving any unsightly stain on your clothing or leaving behind what I like to call "tracks".

Muhammad gathered a concoction of about 10% of Babylonian Talmud (not the Torah of Judaism, but with numerous errors/etc); about 5% of Christianity (a few parts of the Gospel, but distorted and erroneous, probably gathered from Mary his Coptic slave, and Waraqa, his wife Khadijas Christian cousin, and during his travels to Syria); about 25% of existing Hindu temples/Allah/idols/rituals and beliefs in Saudi Arabia. (The word Allah is a Sanskrit word and in truth, there is no Islamic Allah); about 10% of Animism (spirits, demons, Jinns, devils, spirits, etc) gathered from existing Arab folklore and mythical tales; about 10% of Arabic traditions and culture, and 40% of Muhammad and his companions own barbaric creations, to make up Islam, his new religion. Since Muhammad and his several hundred companions were completely illiterate (could not read or write) and Muhammad had a poor memory; thus, his companions memorized for him the Quranic verses they plagiarized/concocted. But in the battle of Yamamah, almost all his companions were killed and the original Quranic verses were lost forever and was never compiled in writing before Muhammad himself was killed by food poisoning in 632 A.D. by a Jewish slave, who said, If you are a true Apostle, Allah would have saved you. Caliph Abu Bakr (632-634A.D.) then entrusted Zayed Ibn Thabit to compile the Quran, from memories of Muhammads illiterate wives, concubines, slaves, and a few contacts; who claimed to have heard Muhammad and his companions utter various verses. Zayed managed to gather an estimated 7,900 verses. But this first compilation of the Quran, with numerous contradictions, ridicule, confusions, and errors, created a lot of trouble and huge problems arose over the years. Under the caliphate of Uthman (644-656 A.D.), he was compelled to withdraw all the distributed, handwritten copies of the Qurans and burnt them. Zayed was again ordered for the second time, to recompile and re-edit the Quran more sensibly and convincingly from his original Quran, kept with Hafsa (Muhammads widow). Zayed did the best he could in re-editing the Quran and more than 2,000 contradictory, confusing, erroneous and illogical verses were abrogated (cancelled), some were replaced, and others added/borrowed to make sense of the cancellations/replacements. This re-edited Quran in Sura 16:101-103 says Arabs accused a Christian slave of teaching Muhammad and was persecuted, and 25:4-5 confirms accusations of borrowing stories from Folktales, and Fables by the then Arabs. Abu Al-Aswad Al Doaly put dots as syntactical marks, during the time of Mu'awiya Ibn Abi Sufian (661-680 A.D). The letters were marked with different dotting by Nasr Ibn Asem and Hayy ibn Ya'amor, during the time of Abd Al-Malek Ibn Marawan (685-705 A.D). A complete system of diacritical marks, (damma, fataha, kasra,), were newly created by Al Khaleel Ibn Ahmad Al Faraheedy (d. 786 A.D). Now the Quran stands at only 6,241 verses today from its original 7,900. But given the circumstances prevailing in those days and the fact that compiling from various uneducated peoples memories, etc; this concocted manmade Quran, still have a lot of contradictions, confusions, absurdities, illogicalities, ridicule, errors, unscientific theories, etc. (For details, see A dialogue between a Christian and a Muslim about the Quran and A balanced understanding of Islam in this website). So a lot of people did have a hand in inventing the Quran. Thus, the bulk of the verses of todays Quran, are actually from Muhammads wives, concubines, temporary wives, slaves and was edited by Zayed Ibn Thabit (it has nothing to do with God).|`|n9xwRjBdaa	reported for being a redundant, lying, boring clone.      :)  go brush your teeth or something, alot of crap comming out your face just now hun.|`|1d363f03d60fb308080ce24ce83cc10baa	Another IGNORANT    QURAN is the only WORD OF GOD in ORIGINAL/PURE FORM. Reason is clear in the verse below, that GOD promised to protect QURAN.    [15:9] Absolutely, we have revealed the reminder, and, absolutely, we will preserve it.   http://www.submission.org/q-t.html...      The Quranic challenge (since past 1400 years, present and future)    Here are the verses that mention the challenge;       Say, "If all the humans and all the jinns banded together  in order to produce a Quran like this, they could never   produce anything like it, no matter how much assistance   they lent one another." [17:88]       If you have any doubt regarding what we revealed to our   servant, then produce one sura like these, and call upon  your own witnesses against GOD, if you are truthful.   [2:23]       This Quran could not possibly be authored by other than   GOD. It confirms all previous messages, and provides a   fully detailed scripture. It is infallible, for it comes from   the Lord of the universe. If they say, "He fabricated it,"   say, "Then produce one sura like these, and invite   whomever you wish, other than GOD, if you are truthful."   [10:37-38]       If they say, "He fabricated (the Quran)," tell them, "Then   produce ten suras like these, fabricated, and invite   whomever you can, other than GOD, if you are truthful."   [11:13]       Do they say, "He made it all up?" Instead, they are   simply disbelievers. Let them produce a Hadith like this,   if they are truthful.

First and foremost the Qur'an never had over 800 suras but over 800 ayats (which it does---it has over 6000 thousand ayats). The Qur'an was memorised by the citizens of Madinah in it's complete form which had 114 Suras. The Qur'an was complete by the time Muhammad died.    As for the hadith, there were many hadith...however you have to distinguish which ones are weak or not. A hadith can essentially be the commentary of the Qur'an, the biography of Muhammad or traditions (Sunnah). The hadith can therefore be numerous however the bulk is not considered a Holy Scripture to the extent that the Qur'an is, the only sacred hadith exist in some forms that we use today.|`|dc43f917412e9343f22a9d10e11690a0aa	The Jackass god you are referring to, is the same god you believe in.

Second, if there is 9000 hadith, and only 60 are quoted, is good, can you memories your entire bible by hart, NO.You can not.    and Allah did not promise to protect the Koran, we Muslims promised to protect the Koran.    Last Who is protecting the Bible?and why is it re-written? is it to meet the greedy needs of your Holy Lonely Gay Priests or What?    We Muslims know that your Religion is a LOST religion and you can not bring it back...word of advise, Stop mocking Muslims and I will stop insulting you..OK|`|AA10418441	1- There are no 800 suras. This is certainly a mistake. And yes, "allah promised to protect the quran"    2- Hadith is a whole other issue. There were more than 600 000 reported Hadiths during Islamic History most of which were incorret accounts of Muhammed's life. Bukhary and Moslem (2 islamic schoolars) filtered these Hadiths to a criteria they set and reduced the no. of reliable Hadiths to about 3000-4000. Those and the sligthly less reliable ones are extensively used in Islamic legislation. I need to stress on the fact that most of the so-called relaible Hadiths can't pass really without criticisim. In fact, the basis Islamic Terrorist use to justify their actions is derived from Hadiths and not Quran. So Hadith needs an extensive revision. If you want to know about the real islam, please commit to the Quran ALONE.    Hope i was helpful.    P.S. U asked why u are insulted when u asked questions? Well, u are not exactly considerate.

The greatest miracle bestowed upon him was the revelation of the Qur'an. The Qur'an is miraculous in a number of aspects: Its linguistic perfection and inimitability, its validation by recent historical, archaeological, and scientific discoveries, its prophecies and so on. Unlike the miracles of other prophets before him, the miracle of the Qur'an is eternal. Prophet Muhammad(P) also provided us with a number of true prophecies.    Below are accounts of the some of the other miracles of Prophet Muhammad(P) . Before reading these, it helps to know something about the Science of Traditions (Arabic: Ahadith), an exacting and comprehensive system developed by early Muslim scholars to verify the chain of transmission of these accounts, as well as investigating the trustworthiness and capability of every narrator at every level of the chain. This thorough authentication process ensures that these accounts are real, validated narrations of the sayings, actions, and tacit approvals of the Prophet Muhammad(P). The Traditions mentioned below are all from Sahih al-Bukhari, the most authentic collection.     Splitting of the Moon     Food Multiplication     Water Multiplication     Supplication for Rain     Lights to guide Companions     Crying of the stem of the Date-palm Tree     Glorification of Allah by the Prophet's meals     The explusion of a Christian liar's corpse by the Earth     The Speech of the Wolf     The Prophet's Night Journey to Jerusalem and Ascent to the Heavens          Splitting of the Moon - "The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder" [Qur'an 54:1]    Volume 6, Book 60, Number 388:     Narrated Abdullah:     The moon was cleft asunder while we were in the company of the Prophet, and it became two parts. The Prophet said, Witness, witness (this miracle)."     Food Multiplication    Volume 4, Book 56, Number 780:     Narrated Jabir:     My father had died in debt. So I came to the Prophet and said, "My father (died) leaving unpaid debts, and I have nothing except the yield of his date palms; and their yield for many years will not cover his debts. So please come with me, so that the creditors may not misbehave with me." The Prophet went round one of the heaps of dates and invoked (Allah), and then did the same with another heap and sat on it and said, "Measure (for them)." He paid them their rights and what remained was as much as had been paid to them.     Water Multiplication    Volume 4, Book 56, Number 779:     Narrated 'Abdullah:     We used to consider miracles as Allah's Blessings, but you people consider them to be a warning. Once we were with Allah's Apostle on a journey, and we ran short of water. He said, "Bring the water remaining with you." The people brought a utensil containing a little water. He placed his hand in it and said, "Come to the blessed water, and the Blessing is from Allah." I saw the water flowing from among the fingers of Allah's Apostle , and no doubt, we heard the meal glorifying Allah, when it was being eaten (by him).     Volume 4, Book 56, Number 777:     Narrated Al-Bara:     We were one-thousand-and-four-hundred persons on the day of Al-Hudaibiya (Treaty), and (at) Al-Hudaibiya (there) was a well. We drew out its water not leaving even a single drop. The Prophet sat at the edge of the well and asked for some water with which he rinsed his mouth and then he threw it out into the well. We stayed for a short while and then drew water from the well and quenched our thirst, and even our riding animals drank water to their satisfaction.     Volume 1, Book 7, Number 340:     Narrated 'Imran:     Once we were traveling with the Prophet and we carried on traveling till the last part of the night and then we (halted at a place) and slept (deeply). There is nothing sweeter than sleep for a traveler in the last part of the night. So it was only the heat of the sun that made us to wake up and the first to wake up was so and so, then so and so and then so and so (the narrator 'Auf said that Abu Raja' had told him their names but he had forgotten them) and the fourth person to wake up was 'Umar bin Al-Khattab. And whenever the Prophet used to sleep, nobody would wake up him till he himself used to get up as we did not know what was happening (being revealed) to him in his sleep. So, 'Umar got up and saw the condition of the people, and he was a strict man, so he said, "Allahu Akbar" and raised his voice with Takbir, and kept on saying loudly till the Prophet got up because of it. When he got up, the people informed him about what had happened to them. He said, "There is no harm (or it will not be harmful). Depart!" So they departed from that place, and after covering some distance the Prophet stopped and asked for some water to perform the ablution. So he performed the ablution and the call for the prayer was pronounced and he led the people in prayer. After he finished from the prayer, he saw a man sitting aloof who had not prayed with the people. He asked, "O so and so! What has prevented you from praying with us?" He replied, "I am Junub and there is no water. " The Prophet said, "Perform Tayammum with (clean) earth and that is sufficient for you."     Then the Prophet proceeded on and the people complained to him of thirst. Thereupon he got down and called a person (the narrator 'Auf added that Abu Raja' had named him but he had forgotten) and 'Ali, and ordered them to go and bring water. So they went in search of water and met a woman who was sitting on her camel between two bags of water. They asked, "Where can we find water?" She replied, "I was there (at the place o|`|AA11852741	the only one miracle that Muslim proclaim that Muhammad did was splitting the moon into half|`|b07c21c0f3a5bf01825c96647ca52d17aa	It's another book written after the prophets death and complied by rumors of the people of that time.

mfrakIpDaa	Whites may be discriminated against, but the truth is that whites are the majority. They have less to deal with than other races. America is a white man's world. So they don't have to interact with other races if they don't want to.    Being any other race, it is impossible to avoid having to deal with a different race, since white's are the true majority. Also you need to think about something...why wouldn't some people discriminate against whites?    If I get discriminated against by whites, why would I like them and enjoy how they are? That is just like trusting someone that doesn't like you. So you can't really blame other races for discriminating against a race that discriminates against them.    You have to give respect, in order to get respect. If you don't respect me, then "f*** you too."...I'm not directing that at anyone, that speaking from a theoretical level.|`|AA11843348	I guess you would have to see it from the other side to understand.

I have ended up the scapegoat at several employers after this kind of a situation.  And I dont live in a small town either.  I live in a big city which has a large amount of minorities (More than 30%).    That being said, if you really think you are being discriminated against for being white, call the NAACP, maybe they will help you out.  They helped out my father years ago.  The laws are not designed to give underqualified minorities jobs, they are meant to ensure jobs to qualified minorities.

bfaaa98c6de64a2c72c7cab3b88df316aa	Negation    To make a sentence negative, place the word "no" before the verb.     Ella no habla ingls.  She doesn't speak English.  l no es profesor.  He is not a professor.     When the answer to a question is negative, two negative words are required.     ?Habla Ud. espa?ol? (Do you speak Spanish?)  No. No hablo espa?ol. (No. I don't speak Spanish.)  ? Est Gerardo en la clase? (Is Gerardo in the class?)  No. Gerardo no est en la clase. (No. Gerardo is not in the class.)  ?Siempre estudias? (Do you always study?)  No, nunca estudio. (No, I never study.)     Here's a list of affirmative words and their negative counterparts:     algo (something)  nada (nothing)    alguien (somebody)  nadie (nobody)    algn (-o, -a, -os, -as) (some, something)  ningn (-o, -a, -os, -as) (no, none)    siempre (always)  nunca (never) jams (never, ever)    tambin (also)  tampoco (neither, not either)    o . . . o (either . . . or)  ni . . . ni (neither . . . nor)      The negative words can be used alone, preceding the verb.     Nadie habla.  Nobody speaks.    l nunca come.  He never eats.    Alfredo tampoco baila.  Alfredo doesn't dance either.     The negative words can also be used with the word "no," following the verb. Note that unlike English, double negatives are acceptable in Spanish.     No habla nadie.  Nobody speaks.    l no come nunca.  He never eats.    Alfredo no baila tampoco .  Alfredo doesn't dance either.     Sometimes, three negative words occur in the same sentence.     No compro nada nunca.  I never buy anything.    l no compra nada tampoco.  He doesn't buy anything either.     You can even have four negative words in the same sentence.     Yo no veo nunca a nadie tampoco.  I never see anybody either.     Unlike English, Spanish does not normally mix negative and affirmative words.     English  Maria doesn't need anything.  NOT Maria doesn't need nothing.    Spanish  Mara no necesita nada.  NOT Mara no necesita algo.      Alguno and ninguno drop the -o before a masculine singular noun.     ?Tienes algn libro?  No, no tengo ningn libro.      Ninguno(-a) is generally used in the singular.     ?Tienes algunas revistas?  No, no tengo ninguna.    ?Tienes algunos libros?  No, no tengo ninguno.      The plural of ninguno(-a) is used only when the noun it modifies exists only in plural.     Ningunas vacaciones a Alaska son completas sin una excursin a Mt. McKinley.  No vacation to Alaska is complete without a trip to Mt. McKinley.   In this example "ningunas" is used because "vacaciones" only exists in plural form.|`|AA10816004	no=not, no  nada=nothing  nunca=never  nadie=no one  tampoco=neither  ninguno, ninguna, ningn=not any  ni=neither, nor  jams=never, ever

Contra la idea generalizada de que los totonacos viven slo en Veracruz y Puebla, donde forman la segunda etnia ms importante despus de los nahuas, los hay tambin en los estados de Mxico y Michoacn. En tierras mexiquenses son cinco mil 433 y en Michoacn apenas 763, representando respectivamente el 1.74 y el 0.7 de la poblacin indgenas de las dos entidades.    En Veracruz estn asentados en una regin denominada Totonacapan, trmino derivado del nombre de la etnia, y localizada a lo largo del centro de Veracruz, en la costa central del Golfo de Mxico y las monta?as de la Sierra Madre Oriental. Una importante regin del Totonacapan est asentada en la Sierra Norte de Puebla, donde habitan 86 mil 392 totonacos que representan el 2.13 por ciento de la poblacin indgena de ese estado.    El municipio veracruzano ms importante de Totonacapan en el norte es Papantla y en el sur la regin de Jalapa-Misantla. En la zona alta de la Sierra Madre Oriental, colindante con Puebla, destacan Cosquihue, Zozocolco, Mecatln, Coyutla y Filomeno Mata. Adems de su arraigada tradicin indgena, estas poblaciones son famosas en la regin por sus templos catlicos coloniales, la mayora saqueados de sus pinturas, retablos y santos, con excepcin del Zozocolco.    Voladores de Papantla en el Totonacapan    Los totonacos estn emparentados con los tepehuas, sus vecinos de Hidalgo, hablan zoque y zoque-maya y comparten, adems de espacios geogrficos, muchos ritos religiosos y tradiciones prehispnicas con nahuas, otomes y huastecos. Este es el caso de la peregrinacin al cerro Poztectitla en el que se concentran pueblos de varias etnias para pedir a sus dioses antiguos el favor del trueno, el rayo, el maz y la lluvia para tener buenas cosechas.    Destaca asimismo el ritual folclorizado de los Voladores de Papantla, hoy representado en Estados Unidos, Japn y varios pases de Europa por obra de la eficiencia promocional y organizativa del gremio de intrpretes. Los danzantes voladores tienen una fuerte asociacin laboral en las plazas del pas donde ejecutan su ritual folclorizado, el cual omite sin embargo slo una parte del rito.    De acuerdo con el doctor Hugo Garca Valencia, coordinador de etnografa del INAH en Veracruz, el rito de los voladores contena un ceremonial mucho ms grande y complejo, con representaciones y danzas en tierra; es decir, no se limitaba al ejercicio areo en el palo del volador. En tiempos prehispnicos era realizado de la Huasteca a Guatemala por todas las etnias de Mesoamrica, pero hoy slo lo representan totonacos, nahuas, otomes y huastecos con la versin acotada a la danza y el vuelo areo.    La ceremonia ritual tena y conserva an en sus ejecuciones ntimas, no para turistas una funcin invocatoria a dioses relacionados con bosques, viento, trueno, lluvia y cultivos alimentarios, como el maz. La extincin del rbol del que se saca el palo volador est propiciando cambios en la ejecucin del rito ahora se usan postes de hierro y en la vestimenta de los danzantes y otros actores de la ceremonia.    Los vestidos totonacos de anta?o, de procedencia mestiza, fueron famosos por su riqueza y colorido. En el siglo XIX las faldas y blusas femeniles se hacan con base a dise?os de trajes, telas, brocados, cintas y joyas francesas. Se traa chaquira de Europa del Este e incluso en el Totonacapan de la Sierra de Puebla haba depsitos de esta mercanca por la gran demanda que tena en la poblacin indgena y mestiza.    Hoy este rico vestuario, que en el pasado se sustent con el xito exportador de la vainilla, ha desaparecido como consecuencia del decaimiento comercial de este producto, del caf, la ca?a de azcar y la pimienta. La Coordinacin de Etnografa del INAH en Veracruz, opera a dos grupos de investigacin en Totonacapan (secciones norte y sur) que preparan mapas tnicos de la regin para el Atlas Etnogrfico de Mxico.|`|BvIzX1u7aa	En Mxico, le decimos naco a aquella persona tpicamente inculta, de mal gusto para vestir, que habla de manera vulgar e inculta, se presume que son de bajo estrato social, pero la verdad es que existen en cualquier estrato social.

Por el lado religioso pues ya estariamos hablando de otra cosa, es unicamente cuestion de principios; segun las religiones, (y no todas), la masturbacion es un acto impuro e indeseable porque estas promoviendote a ti mismo actos de lujuria y deseo desenfrenado, situaciones que las religiones que no lo ven bien, son actos que te pondran en riesgo ante esas sociedades.

Los curas se masturban como todo el mundo.    Esto corresponde a la idea negativa que la iglesia tiene del sexo.    Una chica hablaba de que el masturbarse corresponde a una falta de autodisciplina, y que cuanto mas te dejas llevar por tu instinto, mas bajo te vuelves. Pero esto lo dicen solo del sexo. Si una persona, a cada cosa que le pasa, alaba a Dios o le reza o hace algo religioso, no se dira que le falta autocontrol sino que es muy piadoso. Pero si te masturbas, es que eres un incontrolado.    Esa visin negativa del sexo es muy perniciosa y hace mucho da?o a los creyentes que se lo creen.|`|Yy4zDqzraa	no es cierto que masturbarse te propicia ceguera pero si da?a tu organismo masturbarse una vez al dia es como se tuvieses sexso 10 veces aldia|`|kBfUTjGBaa	Esta es una de las preguntas que los jvenes se hacen ms frecuentemente. Muchos lderes tienen dificultad respondiendo la pregunta debido a que la Biblia nunca menciona la masturbacion de manera especfica.   Para entender lo que Dios cree de la masturbacin, tenemos que examinar otros versculos que tratan con asuntos como el dominio propio, la lujuria, la pureza y la castidad. Tambin, debemos analizar sus frutos para ver si la masturbacin es de Dios.   Nuestra oracin es que este artculo pueda ser ledo sin apasionamiento y que traiga liberacin y paz al lector.   "?Le importa a Dios lo que nosotros hagamos en la privacidad de nuestras habitaciones?"  El sexo fue inventado por Dios. l es el cerebro detrs de la invencin del sexo. Dios no invent nada de lo que haya tenido que arrepentirse en nuestros cuerpos. Esta hermosa expresin de amor de parte de Dios para con nosotros debi salir de lo ms profundo de su corazn. Aquellos hermanos que estn casados saben que no existe nada ms hermoso que el limpio placer de una relacin ntima con su amado(a). Pero como he dicho, esta expresin es preciosa siempre y cuando se haga en la intimidad del matrimonio. Es slo ah donde este placer puede ser disfrutado a plenitud, tal y como nos lo dice la Biblia:   "Tengan todos en alta estima el matrimonio y la fidelidad conyugal, porque Dios juzgar a los adlteros y a todos los que cometen inmoralidades sexuales". Hebreos 13:4  Mientras ms hermoso y nico algo es (como lo es el contacto sexual), ms nos hacemos dependientes de esto. Para bien o para mal. Esta es la razn por la que es tan fcil para el maligno corromper las cosas ms lindas que Dios nos ha dado. Cuando nos enamoramos ms del regalo que de quien nos lo dio, ese mismo regalo comienza a destruirnos. A Dios le importa mucho lo que nosotros hacemos con nuestros cuerpos, sea en pblico o en privado. l no desea que abusemos de nuestros cuerpos en lo absoluto.   De hecho, una antigua definicin de masturbacin es "abusar de s mismo". Sin embargo, los diccionarios ms modernos ya no proporcionen esta definicin. ?Qu sorpresa! 1 Corintios 6:18 tambin nos dice lo mismo cuando afirma que las relaciones sexuales ilcitas corrompen y profanan nuestros cuerpos:   "Huyan de la inmoralidad sexual. Todos los dems pecados que una persona comete quedan fuera de su cuerpo; pero el que comete inmoralidades sexuales peca contra su propio cuerpo." 1 Corintios 6:18  Pero "?No es mejor masturbarse que cometer fornicacin?"  La respuesta fcil a esta pregunta sera, "Por supuesto, es mejor masturbarse, porque por lo menos la contaminacin solamente corrompe el cuerpo del que se masturba. Es el mejor de dos males." Sin embargo, ?Por qu un Dios amoroso, todopoderoso y santo nos dejara la penosa situacin de tener que escoger el menor de dos males? La respuesta a esta pregunta debe ser respondida regresando al plan original que Dios tena en mente cuando nos dio la capacidad sexual.   Primeramente, la masturbacin nunca satisface de la forma que Dios quiso que la satisfaccin sexual satisficiera. Por unos momentos, la masturbacin da la impresin de que s satisface, pero a la larga crea deseos y capacidades sexuales ms profundas que antes de la masturbacin. Existen terapeutas que usan la masturbacin como una terapia para aumentar el deseo sexual de algunos de sus pacientes. El problema de la masturbacin es que se convierte en un crculo vicioso. Mientras ms se ejercita, ms deseos se tiene. Es ah donde Satans nos tiene en sus manos. Mientras ms nos entregamos a la auto- satisfaccin, ms control tiene el pecado en nuestra carne.   "Ciertamente les aseguro que todo el que peca es esclavo del pecado". Juan 8:34.  Y lo peor del caso es que a menudo, la masturbacin envuelve fantasas, visualizaciones y hasta pornografa. La Biblia es clara en lo referente a estas reas de fantasa y lujuria. Durante el acto de masturbacin es necesario poner a trabajar la mente, y ya sea recordando momentos vividos o imaginando fantasas, se recurre a la fabricacin artificial de una realidad que no existe. Es por esta razn que la pornografa es el acompa?ante ideal de la masturbacin, especialmente en los jvenes solteros. Pero, ah es donde est el peligro: ?En quin se piensa? ?Qu actos se imagina uno que est ejecutando con la persona que en realidad no est?:   "Ustedes han odo que se dijo: 'No cometas adulterio', pero yo les digo que cualquiera que mira a una mujer y la codicia ya ha cometido adulterio con ella en el corazn." Mateo 5:28.  Mirar una mujer (o a un hombre) que pasa frente a usted o mirar a una mujer (o a un hombre) impresa en una pgina o en una pantalla son aqu equivalentes antes Dios. El que la mira y "la codicia (sin estar casado con ella), ya ha cometido adulterio con ella en el corazn". Note que aqu se habla del que est soltero, no del que est casado. Esta regla no es solamente aplicable para el hombre, sino tambin para la mujer.   Mientras Mateo 5:28 se refieren a hombres que anhelan mujeres, todas las mujeres saben que esto podra ser muy fcilmente invertido y ser aplicado a ellas. Los hombres podemos ser ms fcilmente estimulados de manera visual que las mujeres, pero las mujeres pueden ser tan vulnerables a las fantasas sexuales en el reino emocional. Cualquiera de los dos que lo haga est cometiendo un pecado ante Dios, y los dos deben poner en prctica el "dominio propio", controlando sus impulsos y pensamientos a travs del poder de Cristo.   Toda la inmoralidad sexual empieza con un pensamiento. Un pensamiento lujurioso no tomado en serio, llevar en el futuro a otras perversiones, porque el pecado se reproduce poco a poco.

Si no, este mundo ya se habra acabado hace ya varios siglos o milenios!    Si no, pregntenle a las mujeres que ya han tenido parto!    Y las reacciones del cuerpo siguen naturalitas. Lo que est bien pirata es que quieras divertirte t solo en vez de hacer lo que es natural: tener hijos.    Todo el abuso es da?ino. Se clasifica un elemento "txico" en el cuerpo humano como algo que est en exceso. Bixido de carbono en exceso se llama asfixia, Oxgeno en exceso se llama hiperventilacin, agua en exceso se llama ahogamiento. ?Claro?    Emotivamente y espiritualmente ocurre lo mismo. Por eso Se condenan los famosos 7 pecados capitales.

De tener lo que es necesario para vivir bien a acumular lana desmedidamente y perjudicar a otros con ese afn, hay un mundo de diferencia.    Es que busques lo que es mejor para ti.

If it helps any, I'm a pretty damn masculine guy, almost a Klingon, and I occasionally do a little cross-dressing, and I almost always wear a Samoan sorong around the house, or in public when I visit Hawaii.

iv3LIRsraa	No.. It's not true at all, A lot of people may belive in it, but that is usually because it is hammered into their head, since they are born, its like... being 7, and it's kinda like, nobody, not your parents or your friends, or anyone tells you santa doesn't exist, because everyone your whole life has told you that he exitst, it seems probable to belive, does it not?    I know I will probably get a few thumbs downs on this, because of my beliefs, but whatever, all I really want, is for the original asker of the question, to read this. |`|1jhjdh0caa	well the answer is, faith without works is dead. So you would have to have faith that it's real. But personally, I think that it is because I've seen relics and historical recovery of actual artifacts from the Bible.

Some of the Bible is allegedly allegorical and some stories are just that, stories, but stories that teach.  Some parts of the Bible are individual recollections of the author (The four Gospels) and some things read as if the writer was describing a vision he had while on wild mushrooms (Revelation).    All in all, it's a compendium of all kinds of stories, psalms, proverbs, truths and half-truths and probably a few lies.  (Did the snake talk in Eden?  Did Balaam's donkey really talk?  Did an axe head float in the water?")    Read it with an analytical mind.  Don't buy everything.  Don't discount everything.  Let your heart and mind come to a compromise on what it is that you find as your truth.|`|Y2LJrn7maa	Actually, nothing in the bible has any historical proof.     The Romans where meticulous record keepers and they made no mention of Jesus of Nazareth.     There is no relics from the Jews wandering in the desert.     There is no Noah's Ark evidence.   Although every religion that predates the bible mentions a flood.   The Noah's Ark Fable may have been inspired by Gilgamesh which was written hundreds of years before the flood in the bible.     The begats in the bible are different from book to book. Check it out.     There's no historical evidence of King David, Moses, King Solomon or any of the other fictional characters in the bible. |`|RDsdnkmfaa	The Bible contains many, many stories.  Some seem plausible, some are ridiculous.  Take the story of Moses.  There isn't one shred of archaeological evidence that there were a ton of people wandering the desert for 40 years.  An entire nomadic community and not one bit of evidence?  Seems unlikely.    But the story of Jesus might be true.  There were in fact many prophets and messiahs around that time.  They didn't get as famous as Jesus, but there were a lot.  Although there are still doubts as to whether or not Jesus existed, most believe he did.  The whole thing about dying and resurrection...well that's just not true.  Watch the video I post in sources.  It's hilarious and may shed some light on the issue.|`|HR6TF0gDaa	I believe it to be true. There is some archaeological evidence to support some of the biblical stories. |`|XpZumlkwaa	The Bible is the true story from Genesis to Revelations about one Man. It's about how His mother Mary would come through the linage of Adam and Adam's son Seth...and so and so on...to bring Him into the world. The Spirit of God created Adam in order for Mary to be born, to bring Christ into this world. All the prophesies in the Old T. speaks about Him. In the New T. it tells of His life on earth, after He left heaven to come down and do His Father's will. What was that? To save the rest of God's children from His wrath. From Cain to the last human left on earth, to save us. |`|J1rrfQk0aa	That's all a matter of what you believe. Read the story of creation, exodus, and the teachings of Jesus in the New testament.

tdxu0ztPaa	Jesus WAS a real living, breathing person. whether or not he did the things people say he did is not agreed upon.|`|6Whz1p5Eaa	Question: "Did Jesus really exist? Is there any historical evidence of Jesus Christ?"    Answer: Typically when this question is asked, the person asking qualifies the question with "outside of the Bible." We do not grant this idea that the Bible cannot be considered a source of evidence for the existence of Jesus. The New Testament contains hundreds of references to Jesus Christ. There are those who date the writing of the Gospels in the second century A.D., 100+ years after Jesus' death. Even if this were the case (which we strongly dispute), in terms of ancient evidences, writings less than 200 years after events took place are considered very reliable evidences. Further, the vast majority of scholars (Christian and non-Christian) will grant that the Epistles of Paul (at least some of them) were in fact written by Paul in the middle of the first century A.D., less than 40 years after Jesus' death. In terms of ancient manuscript evidence, this is extraordinarily strong proof of the existence of a man named Jesus in Israel in the early first century A.D.    It is also important to recognize that in 70 A.D., the Romans invaded and destroyed Jerusalem and most of Israel, slaughtering its inhabitants. Entire cities were literally burned to the ground! We should not be surprised, then, if much evidence of Jesus' existence was destroyed. Many of the eye-witnesses of Jesus would have been killed. These facts likely limited the amount of surviving eyewitness testimony of Jesus.    Considering the fact that Jesus' ministry was largely confined to a relatively unimportant backwater area in a small corner of the Roman Empire, a surprising amount of information about Jesus can be drawn from secular historical sources. Some of the more important historical evidences of Jesus include the following:    The first-century Roman Tacitus, who is considered one of the more accurate historians of the ancient world, mentioned superstitious "Christians " ("named after Christus" which is Latin for Christ), who suffered under Pontius Pilate during the reign of Tiberius. Suetonius, chief secretary to Emperor Hadrian, wrote that there was a man named Chrestus (or Christ) who lived during the first century (Annals 15.44 ).    Flavius Josephus is the most famous Jewish historian. In his Antiquities he refers to James, the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ. There is a controversial verse (18:3) that says, "Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to call him a man. For he was one who wrought surprising feats. . . . He was [the] Christ . . . he appeared to them alive again the third day, as the divine prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning him." One version reads, "At this time there was a wise man named Jesus. His conduct was good and [he] was known to be virtuous. And many people from among the Jews and the other nations became his disciples. Pilate condemned him to be crucified and to die. But those who became his disciples did not abandon his discipleship. They reported that he had appeared to them three days after his crucifixion, and that he was alive; accordingly he was perhaps the Messiah, concerning whom the prophets have recounted wonders."    Julius Africanus quotes the historian Thallus in a discussion of the darkness which followed the crucifixion of Christ (Extant Writings, 18).    Pliny the Younger, in Letters 10:96, recorded early Christian worship practices including the fact that Christians worshiped Jesus as God and were very ethical, and includes a reference to the love feast and Lords Supper.    The Babylonian Talmud (Sanhedrin 43a) confirms Jesus' crucifixion on the eve of Passover, and the accusations against Christ of practicing sorcery and encouraging Jewish apostasy.    Lucian of Samosata was a second-century Greek writer who admits that Jesus was worshiped by Christians, introduced new teachings, and was crucified for them. He said that Jesus' teachings included the brotherhood of believers, the importance of conversion, and the importance of denying other gods. Christians lived according to Jesus laws, believed themselves immortal, and were characterized by contempt for death, voluntary self-devotion, and renunciation of material goods.    Mara Bar-Serapion confirms that Jesus was thought to be a wise and virtuous man, was considered by many to be the king of Israel, was put to death by the Jews, and lived on in the teachings of his followers.    Then we have all the Gnostic writings (The Gospel of Truth, The Apocryphon of John, The Gospel of Thomas, The Treatise on Resurrection, etc.) that all mention Jesus.    In fact, we can almost reconstruct the gospel just from early non-Christian sources: Jesus was called the Christ (Josephus), did magic, led Israel into new teachings, and was hanged on Passover for them (Babylonian Talmud) in Judea (Tacitus), but claimed to be God and would return (Eliezar), which his followers believed - wor|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	Real person, and like many, has had alot of rumors go around about him, mostly untrue|`|KMn1Iomvaa	yeah, he's my bud, bud.|`|QRbCnBgFaa	WELL, DUHHHHH!!!  if u don't believe in him then get ready 4 hell.|`|KF2yg9Ovaa	Jesus is not a person anymore, he is God|`|Kp9YusZIaa	yes a long time ago. he died then rose again to go to heaven. were waiting for his second coming. |`|R0TY4wpuaa	no, but if he were he would be a closet terrorist.|`|mpRakYDraa	He died over 2,000 years ago.

It means in the year of our Lord.)  |`|QUpMGxEqaa	Jesus was a real person. The Romans were dedicated record-keepers, and there is a brief record of his trial before Pontius Pilate and his conviction of revolutionary zealotry (terrorist, at the time).

bru2xnlRaa	If you anticipate receiving a gift, maybe you should consider giving a gift too.     You can give candy to him. It is likely he will give flowers to you.    I have been married 28 years, my husband likes me to give him female lingerie. It has a special meaning, that he understands. I will be wearing it later !!    I usually get roses from him.|`|cSgztJSZaa	you dont HAVE to but its nice, even something simple and cheap like a container of his favorite candy or a card made by you, or watchin a movie together at your house with treats that you made (like coookies or cupcake)     or decorating a chocolate bar ( take the wrapper off and make your own)|`|VUrbdvD7aa	yes|`|AA10848621	Well traditionally girls never got guys a thing but the times have changed. I think maybe you should get your bf at least a little something for valentines day. Wouldn't it be sad if he was expecting some type of present all day, got all excited, and you got him nothing? Of course I'm not saying you should go out and buy him a car but maybe a card or some candy, its the thought that counts and if you don't get him anything then he might feel like you don't like him enough or you don't think of him. Of course that is just my opinion.  Hope this helps!

I have always thought it has to do with the sky if they  can see it, or a certain smell in the air, that they can only smell with  their delicate noses. I know in the summer, I can tell by the feel of  the lessoning heat of the day, approximately what time it is. And it  is verified by the sun going down quite often. It is amazing that since  they pay attention to their surroundings more than we do, they can  identify the time of day by something triggering their senses.      It must be very confusing to our two dogs tho. As there is no set  time we eat, or go to bed, or even wake up in the morning. And we  never watch the same programs either. It will vary from day to day.  Since seniors don't watch clocks except to know when a given  program might be on, our habits have become more flexible. I know  my husband and I don't set the alarm to wake up. Nor watch the  time to pick to go to bed. It's wonderful to have that ability to do as  we want, anytime we want. It's too bad, we have to wait all of our  working years to reach this state.|`|i81cQUyhaa	My Dogs know when it's time for Me to get up.|`|Mm67HJwZaa	they all have a mickey mouse watch|`|24vQ8D71aa	my dog let's me know it's dinner time between 5:30 and 6:00 every night ,regardless of the season or day light savings, or if i'm cooking or not.  when i ask her HOW she knows , she just gives me a Mona Lisa smile.
XEbrGfZuaa	I was very impressed actually. I have been a past critic (non paid of  course) of prose, and poetry handed to me, in person, as well as over  the internet. And this is the second piece I've read that is actually  worthy of a compliment. It is quite poignant, and the writer invites  the reader in to visualize the scenario. I could identify with the   person drifting off to sleep, and imagined she felt her lovers' arms  enfolding her. I think, many women have known that exact same  feeling. I think that this piece, with a slight bit of polish should be  entered somewhere for publication. Maybe in one of those aimed  at servicemen and women. This one is definitely a keeper and  should be read by a multitude that it might reach other hearts as  it did mine. I say bravo, to the author!|`|9qqzRTpDaa	Quite Beautiful... paints a lovely picture in my mind, and yet solace...|`|ozwLZwXeaa	How beautiful. I wanted to cry.

In fact it is already good enough that IMHO, with a little rework it could be better.    How often have you read the poem out loud?  IMHO, the rhyme scheme you should work for all through the poem is the 4-3-4-3 you set up so nicely in the first stanza.  Once you have an entire poem full of 4-3-4-3 stanzas, you will have gone from a good poem to an outstanding one.    Hope this helps.

jxqNTr9Iaa	Nostradamus is so vague that his quatraines can easily be retro fitted into something that occured,how can he be said to make predictions,he wrote these bizarre and suitably vague four line poems that people make fit..    Now if someone had said in 1927 that the two famous 'hister' quatraines directly referred to Hitler then case closed but it was after the fact as usual.    I've heard of Mother Shipton though I can't say much as I know so little about her but who I do know about,who's prophesies were much more direct in their language and hit rate for coming true would blow nostradamus out the water,in fact he was so good he was sealed in a barrel of pitch,which was set on fire and rolled into a sea loch for being in league with the devil.    If predictions are you're thing then google 'the brahan seer'.|`|1wNsBNmxaa	yes i believe in all of nostradamus predictions because every one that he has fore told has come true       Relic66~~~?|`|921232792e8ae7c34c7818c953169f6caa	Nostradamus.  What was written was in his time.  What is being told is in present time.  Some of the event had already happened in time.  Survivors of "Star on 45" with their children in "Area 51" being the last descendant of this generation expose by the missing key must solve the misery before leaving with time.  Time is not on the side of survivors of "Star on 45" with their children in "Area 51"  Those back in the past with self lack of knowledge and total loss of IQ could not solve it back in the past.  It was not in their time to solve without the missing key it but in our time.  The young one - the lost generation could not solve it in time when they were living in misery with the missing link in time.  Without solving the misery for them will not be able to survivor or make it through the next century in time.  At present the lost generation is already at loss and stranded in time while some is already moving backwards without being aware of it being exposed by the mystery of us-911 in time.  Luke 21.30-33  Luke 6.39-40,41-45,46-49  Luke 9.25,55-56,60  Luke 8.5-8,10-17  Leviticus 4.13,22  Luke 16.13  Exodus 23.24,32  John 8.44  Matt 23.27  Matt 7.15-27  Matt 22.17-21,32  Luke 9.27  Exodus 20.5  Exodus 20.1-7  Luke 24.44-45,47  Revelation 22.13-17  Revelation 17 - 20  Revelation 5.2-5  What do you think?|`|CB15kchkaa	Don't know anything about mother shipton, but Nostradamus is a mystery. Or to be more precise how anyone calls his quatrains predictions, I don't know. He wrote a load of gobbleydegook which other people later said was a prediction of this or that, but in reality it's whatever the interpreter wanted it to be. The only impressive stanza was one which seemingly talked of nazism, and actually included the name 'hisler'. Apart from that it's just bunkum.|`|Hr2tnZtqaa	No  They are both vague and can be related  to  more then one event. It is not  until after an event that those events are attributed to their  predictions. Even if they were  true what good is it that we don't know till after the event.  By the way  this has absolutely nothing to  to with the Mayans.|`|Cx9c6KrVaa	No. While Nostradamus' predictions have been twisted and reinterpreted over and over again to mean whatever happens to be the flavour of the month, they have still been quite wide of the mark. I m not familiar with Shiptons.|`|aIZfiU6Kaa	Nostradamus was a failed and discredited court astrologer before he wrote his famous 'Quatrains' he couldn't even get that right.    His Quatrains were written in a very cryptic poetic manner and none of his predictions came true before the event only afterwards can you read whatever you want to into them.    One of the most famous ones mentioned by fastbob predicted a rise in the Hister, which the gullible read as the rise of Adolf Hitler.    Ister is the Greek for the River Danube in Germany, need I say more?    James Randi wrote a great book called the Mask of Nostradamus which he has autographed for me, a review is in my source and should convince any Nostradamus believer of the truth.    Mother Shipton is even more of a joke not, even as clever as Nostradumus in conning the gullible.    From my source if you don't have time to read it all:    "It is now generally acknowledged that Mother Shipton was largely a myth, and that many of her prophecies were composed by others after her death, and after the events they 'predicted'. Her prophecies were apparently recorded in a series of diaries but the first published book of her work did not appear until 1641 and the most noted work, by Richard Head, came out in 1684. Head later admitted to inventing almost all Shipton's biographical details".|`|qzwWVgWMaa	Well some of his prophecies have been eerily accurate so far.|`|xbCGVdiOaa	I could make a vague, cryptic prediction and the chances are it would be interpreted as accurate to an event happening withing the next few hundred years.

Something about the religious right in this country has turned a lot of people off. I think it's just a sign of the times.    @Ant Boogie: And white Christians who have Celtic or Native American blood in them are following a religion that was forced on their ancestors too.

I think he already knows that I like him, but that doesn't make a difference. The only reason he doesn't like me(completely) is that I have a flat chest, although I'm a size 34B(not the bras with the actual cups, though). Which means- next year in 8th grade, he might like me! Hopefully. Lol. If my chest listens to me. Ha. I'm not brave enough to give him a card. He is so cute! *Sigh* He loves me! Kind of. lol
ebc5fdfac8f50e088056beb5d5d6f767aa	There has been research done and the most agreed upon theory is that a reversed kind logic caused certain ideas to enter the thoughts of primitive humankind. Ancient hunters either injured or were injured on hunts. The injuries did not kill, but caused serious bleeding. AS the blood left the body the animal or person became weaker, vitality fell away, and there was a drift into death.     Those who witnessed thought that the blood was the elixir of life because of its loss caused death. Therefore they they reversed the process in their minds and decided that blood could also bring vitality and strength to any the imbibed fresh blood.    This theory was defended in the late middle ages by the example of the very vital mongol warriors and there drinking of fresh blood and milk from their steeds.    The Vampire version of today is mostly the product of books and movies. However, every omnivore and carnivore probably ingests some form of blood in their everyday meals.|`|VsJ1LwUdaa	http://www.trueghosttales.com/vampires.p...    try that out, it seems interesting.|`|pMDY89KQaa	oh, It was originally a novel by Bram Stroker called Dracula.

He was the prince of what is now Southern Romania in the mid 1400's. There are details to his story about being imprisoned and various conflicts, but the most influential detail is his means of remaining the feared Vlad the Impaler. His method of torture to prisoners, those who went against his will etc. was to impale them upon extremely tall poles just outside the walls of his city so as to warn those coming in. This was an excruciating, drawn out way to die. He even was rumored to have found a way to impale a person by sitting them on the pole, (inserting it through the rectum) and having it come out their mouth --- and have them survive for hours/days. He had to situate and angle them as well as figure out the correct diameter of the pole an the degree of the point so as to avoid any major organs so they would survive and prolong their punishment.  The typical vampire part comes into play because he set up bowls underneath his victims to catch their blood.  Later, he would drink it.     Check out the history channel's website, they should have a clip of the special they show about him.|`|kyBz7Rlmaa	in the medieval days they didn't know of most medical days, so some times a person was buried alive.

I take 'meditational walks' through the woods on a nice trail, and I 'open myself' to the animals and birds and even the fish in the streams.  I used to be a 'workaholic' until on a meditational walk one day I saw a small tortoise crossing the path in front of me.  This was in a temperate rain forest, not a tropical beach, but since I 'found' that tortoise, I knew that was my 'spirit animal' ... and I seem to 'do' very little now, but I'm much healthier and happier now, and when I do 'real work' I get it done and out of the way quickly, I am able to offer good help just as needed, and go to bed to sleep well every night.

fH6Sg5vTaa	I believe you completly. That does sound like a demon but you might want to make sure before doing anything, you might have a different spirit in your house as well. Is your cat comfortable with it at night? Sometimes a spirit/demon will wait till its dark and it knows you can't do anything to try and interact. It might have also been a rash so you may have to take the advice of that one dude and see if you did anything to set off an allergic reaction. I am not saying your lying quite the opposite in fact, but I want you to check that first before you try to do anything to anger it. Though it may be a protective spirit if your pets are comfortable around it. If it does make you uncomfortable try burning some sage its always helped me. Getting rid of a demon is never fun. I hope this helps. Best wishes to you.|`|gCVA7Z1Maa	Everything you've described can be more simply attributed to common dream disturbances, hallucinations, and your own misinterpretations,  stemming I'm sure from youthful ignorance. As an intelligent person you must be aware of the scientific method and the fact that no one has ever produced evidence of the existence of demons (whatever that might mean) or psychic abilities of any kind. If you read Carl Sagan's book "The Demon-Haunted World: Science As A Candle In The Dark" it explains how these dream effects have led people throughout the ages to imagine monsters attacking them in their sleep, but it's all brain chemistry and psychology. You've got to get a grip on yourself and try to reason this out rationally for once: There is no such thing as the supernatural. Waking dreams, dream paralysis, lucid dreams, and hallucinations are all common experiences. You either scratched yourself in your sleep, or perhaps it was your cat as you rolled over onto its tail? Which is more likely? Imagining you're special and have magic powers is fun for a kid, but it's time to grow up and face reality, you're just like everyone else, a little confused and a little afraid and life doesn't get easier, it just keeps going.|`|eY49t8Swaa	if your psychic tell me what im thinking right now    im not makeing fun of you just tell me what im thinking that would be cool|`|GoWPQvgHaa	this was like a show they did for haunting.    turned out to be gas|`|hHGNE0IRaa	There is no such thing as demons.

ebc5fdfac8f50e088056beb5d5d6f767aa	The bane of the Tragic Hero.  Hamartia: The error, frailty, mistaken judgment, or misstep through which the fortunes of the HERO of a TRAGEDY are reversed. Aristotle asserts that the PROTAGONIST of a TRAGEDY should be a person "who is not eminently good or just, yet whose misfortune is brought about by some error or frailty." This error or frailty is not necessarily a flaw in character, although hamartia is often inaccurately called the tragic flaw. Aristotle sees a movement from happiness to misery as essential to TRAGEDY, and he says, "It is their characters that give men their quality, but their doings that make them happy or the opposite." Hence, hamartia can be an unwitting, even a necessary, misstep in "doing" rather than an error in character. Hamartia may be the result of bad judgment, bad character, ignorance, inherited weakness, accident, or any of many other possible causes. It must, however, express itself through a definite ACTION or the failure to perform a definite ACTION. In Aristotle hamartia is an element of the PLOT.|`|5fdgfNCRaa	Oedipus' story begins when he is an infant. The son of King Laius and Queen Jocasta (of Thebes) have a son, Oedipus. King Laius recieves an oracle/prophecy that he will die by the hand of his son. He sends Queen Jocasta to kill him, but she can't bring herself to do it so she tells her servant to do it. Her servant also doesn't and leaves Bbaby Oedipus in a field to have his fate determined by the Gods.  He is found by a shepherdess and is taken to Corinth and is raised by the childless King of Corinth as if Oedipus were his own son. Oedipus isn't told about his birth and although he hears rumors that King Polybus and Queen Merope (Corinth) are not his real parents, they insist they are. Oedipus is concerned with the oracle that says that he will  "mate with his mother and kill his father."  He wants to go to Thebes to get to the bottom of the story about his birth and on the way there, he and King Laius meet. They fight over who has the right of way (whose chariot should go first) and Oedipus kills Laius, neither of them knowing that they are father and son.   While in Thebes, he solves the riddle of the Sphinx   (What is the creature that walks on four legs in the morning, two legs in the afternoon, and three legs in the evening? : Man.)  As a reward for figuring out the riddle, he is permitted to take Laius' place as king and marry Jocasta. By doing so, he fulfills the prophecy (mating with his mother) although neither of them know that they are mother and son. When Jocasta finds out that Oedipus is indeed her son, she kills herself. In response, Oedipus gouges out his own eyes and sends himself into exile.   "Wisdom is a dreadful thing when it bringeth no profit unto its possessor" (Sophocles).|`|b6cd9d6fe5a0ec1d495444c45c2b75f2aa	You asked this question before.

A tragic flaw is a character quality that causes that character to suffer a great losses.. the problem with oedipus is that he didn't listen and take heed to the prophecies. However, his situation had little to do with him and more his parents. his parents heard the prophecy and did little to make sure he was dead. his flaw was his love and inability to listen|`|edd645d67b1a89d5cfcb1f3510fbf543aa	Well, you got a decent summary of the play Oedipus Rex.

The Tragic Hero of Greek Tragedy was often an upstanding, righteous person of many virtues, who would therefore have a farther distance to plumet when their downfall came.      In a modern context, the tragedy of the plot is related to the way in which the Tragic Hero, through some inherent or slight character flaw, triggers or initiates their own ruin.  In the context of the Greek Tragedies, there was a considerable moral, and therefore religious, aspect to tragedy.  While Oedipus was a generous and noble character, he overstepped mortal boundaries.  The excessive wisdom he displayed in solving the riddle of the Sphinx went against the natural order, and thus, to restore the balance, he had to be punished.  The same can be seen in the myths in which Prometheus steals a piece of the sun, Theseus travels to the underworld, or Daedalus crafts wings for himself and his son Icarus.  While such characters were not necessarily evil, they disobeyed the boundaries of the mortal realm, and in such excess there was repercussion.    On the other hand, the protagonists of the Shakespearean Tragedies were frequently the victims of some inherent character flaw - such as Othelloss jealously, Macbeth's ambition, or Lear's pride - and were not nearly as pure as the Greek heroes such as Thyestes.    One more thing I might add is the concept of catharsis in the Greek tragedy.  Catharsis is a kind of 'purging of emotions' experienced by the audience in response to a tragedy.  These emotions, while sad, were intended to carry with them a sense of order.  While you may pity the Tragic Hero, you accept their mistake and its consequences - they are the architect of their own abortion.  As catharsis was one purpose of tragedy, it was the hamartia of the Tragic Hero that made it possible.
DfIaAkwfaa	i feel really bad for you. just keep your head high and keep looking for someone new. dont worry, youll find someone.|`|4VFEkqJiaa	Zach, if this message really was from her you have had a lucky escape!    How callous to casually dump you like this and not speak face to face after you have been dating for some time.    Worse still, she has used text speak which makes her look like a complete fool!    I suspect it may not actually be from her and is possibly a hijacked account from one of her friends?    If it is real, accept that it is over and think positively about going out and making a new friend or girlfriend.    Good luck!|`|FebNOmqDaa	I am sorry to hear what you are going through, but my suggestion is that if you love someone, let them go and if they come back then it's probably meant to be. You might be feeling really bad right now but just keep yourself busy and amuse yourself as much as possible so the pain won't be that hard. Good luck.|`|xcOJuHDIaa	that sucks dude but she might have been going out with someone else in the last couple weeks   or  maybe shes going out with someone else so she can get stuff off them like money and that stuff|`|w3DzrFo0aa	Its honestly hard to answer this because of the "but im nit ganna go thru with this" line. If you both had a fight she just is sick of it. If you didn't do anything to make her break up with you, she probally had lost the connection with you...  Your ex dumping you over myspace shows very little respect to you and that means she lost interest. She was EXTREMLEY rude to you. That was bad sign. The "I luv u and always will" line is a line that is mostly used to put you down easier even though it doesnt. I can't say that she still loves you but, sounds to me like she doesnt.  I'm sorry your going through this|`|mnyunFvIaa	Hopefully one of her friend just hacked on to her profile and sent you that.Or maybe she just wanted to see how you would react.Girls joke around like that.|`|KdcS1iMxaa	dog, just let her go. Obviously she really wasnt feeling you or something. It sounds like you 2 are young anyway. Trust me, you'll find another. You can't force something to work..........I just read her myspace and she wrote a whole darn book about u. Maybe you should call her and see what's up. tell her you deserve at least a reason why she doesnt want you. Maybe some friends got in her head or something.|`|UPw1Cr54aa	im soo sorry. i visited her page and to be honest everything looks fine. she was so happy with you and you sound happy to be with her but one thing you have to realize is that shes young and she may nor know what she wants..she may think so but is she sure, we dont know that.. she also said that a lot of people tried telling her to brake up with you. maybe they got to her and she realized it woulnd work. what ever you do dont give up because it sounds like yo really love her and when you find love like that you shouldnt give it up so easily. i know because i was once in love but it wasnt the sweetest love everyone wishes for and i fought for it until the end but i soon realized it wasnt worth it because he was a jerk but in your case you both sound soo in love.. itll all work out. try, dont give up..keep your head high.  :]]

In my opinion there are no similarities at all.  The elderly are adults with the knowledge and experience of adults.  Infants are just starting out and do not have that knowledge and experience.  I really do not like to see this.  I have worked with the elderly for many years, and I drill into my staff that elders are adults and should be treated as such.  This is not an appropriate way to convey that truth to others.  Sorry, but I don't agree with what you're doing.  Everything people have listed are true about infants but not true of all elders.

OR rent a hotel room for the night - get all dressed up, go out to dinner, ask the hotel to fix up the room the way you want it to be (most will - tip very well).   and just take it from there..  At least you will have 1 night without his parents (lol).. Good luck on getting into your house.

5ofS2qQYaa	aw shucks...I'm kinda in the same situation...how does a modest muslimah find her perfect hubby?  well...you'll have to be a bit outgoing, but still modest, right?  I suggest you talk about studies...  do you have a Muslim organization or Arab organization of some sort?  The point is to be seen so people gain an interest in you  if you're not seen, people won't know you exist  but don't be showy! PLEASE no! (not that you would!)  best idea is to get involved in your Islamic community  also, start hanging out w/more muslim sisters as they'll be able to tell you which brothers/cousins/neighbors' brothers are on the market or interested in you    in Islam, the most encouraged and safest way to find a spouse is through connections and networking w/in the muslim community  Go to Jumah more often...you'll be spotted by mums + aunts who are on the look out for their sons  being active, yet modest works lots! it's all about networking and creating strong connections  or you can go online...but leave it for last resort    :)    -------  ew...i'd want you to have someone of your standard too  i mean, okay, so they're not great in school...but drinking?  really?...I think you can do better, sis  ---------    Allah(swt) knows best|`|n49i9t6paa	Nadia: she wants an Arab, what's wrong with that?    lol, I'm not mad, I'm just sayin......now I know I MAY seem like I got anger issues...bas mish la ha daraja|`|q2la3Y8caa	salam helwa i say just talk tp them its not hard all my friends are arab guys i cant stand gurls so yea just go u to one and say hi i dont realy know im an arab gurl also|`|bWtp8Zyjaa	I prefer arranged marriages...but good luck to you. =]|`|xuZ2y3ADaa	lol wat bout an afghan hah? not all are nasty or terrorists, u noe what im sayin cool.|`|sE94HgDBaa	Well, maybe if you join some extracurricular clubs or activities at your school that you know some Arabs have joined, you can become friends with them.  Or, if you share some of your classes with Arabs you can make a study group and invite them to join and possibly befriend some of them.  ---  If you'd like to find someone who is religious & practicing maybe you can try the local mosque.  Try to meet people from there by volunteering or signing up for any activities they have.  Maybe you'll end up meeting someone there that goes to your school too.|`|hfAsEiaZaa	why does it have to be an arab?  asnwer that and than i will answer your question.    one ummah:::dont get mad im arab myself.

EmOnt7FIaa	Even though many Somalians/Ethiopians have dark skin, they are actually considered Caucasian. In American Society, the average Somalian would be considered Black because society judges you simply how you look, but skin tone alone can not indicate race, if it could than Asians and some Latino's would be considered white even when they have no white ancestry.    Race is not based off of skin tone/color, it is based off of Bone Structure. If you gather 1 Somalian, 1 Unmixed White Person and 1 Unmixed African Person, the Somalian would be a lot similar in Bone Structure to the white Individual. Just because they happen to be native to the African Continent doesn't mean they are black. Look at the Berbers of Northern Africa, they are native to the continent and they are not considered black. Are all people of the Asian Continent the same race? No! A Saudi Arabian is not the same race as a Japanese person.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	Asians do have different skin tone based on location.

b6cd9d6fe5a0ec1d495444c45c2b75f2aa	Achilles was invincible everywhere except his heel. His mother dipped him in the River Styx as a child, but she held him by the heel so that part of his body did not touch the water. The only way to kill him was by shooting his heel. That's just what happened in the Trojan War. Achilles was fighting in battle for the Greeks when he was shot in the heel and died.     Nowadays, people use the phrase Achilles' heel to identify their weakness. Your weakness is your Achilles' heel. Hope this helps.|`|32la4VGEaa	Achilles heal is Achilles weak spot, based on the fact that Achilles  heal was the only exposed part of his body, the rest was covered in Armour the Arrow was fired by Paris.  i hope that helps.|`|G17CSiL6aa	It means your weak point. Achilles was a greek warrior. After birth, his mother asked the gods how to make him invincible. They told her to dunk her son in the river stix every day. She would always hold her son by his heel to dunk him in the river, which means his heel was the only part that remained mortal. In a battle, he was invincible, but one day someone shot an arrow in his heel which killed him.  So yeah, Achilles Heel means One Weakness.|`|GPCzENwCaa	Yes exactly what the first one said it is his only weak point because that was how he was defeated.
