uaYFNAPUaa	Brandy and Cognac are the same product,however if the brandy comes from Cognac, France, you may call that product Cognac.  That being said, "quality", derived from special grapes,grown and nurtured with special care,stored in fine wooden barrels for extended periods of time,(the best as long as 30-50yrs.),develop nuances of "nose" as well as mellowness and taste. The distilled grape product can come from "many" different countries, and when produced as I have listed, can be one of the greatest experiences you can have.    The "nose" that I've described will be noticed to a greater extent if the brandy product described is served,sniffed, and savored at "room" temperature, however more so at a slightly warmer than normal household temperature.    Be prepared to spend $40-150.00 for great brandy, although I have found some of the best tasting(to me) for under $60 .

Gradually add all the ingredients for the dry spice fry, except the chocolate, pomegranate molasses and the stock, to the olive oil.  4. Stir the ingredients in the oil for a few minutes until they release their aroma, then add the marinated mutton.  5. Allow the meat to sizzle in the saucepan (be careful, it may splatter) for a few minutes and then pour on the liquid from the marinade and the stock.  6. Grate the chocolate on top and add the pomegranate molasses (if using).  7. Cover the saucepan and leave it to cook on a very low heat for about 3-4 hours.

p9rIPd4Maa	Since artificial sugars (or sweeteners) were first introduced decades ago, we've beginning to notice various trends in bad health conditions associated with large consumptions of them. Much that is necessary to fully understand the effects these seemingly innocent chemicals have on our bodies, and if actually the 16kcal extra from one teaspoon of sugar is really a big deal. Studies show that artificial sweeteners are linked to increase numbers of Diabetes (were people experience low sugar attacks) and the increase chance of acquiring Type-2 diabetes. It is also linked to many cancers. Little is known to 100% certainty about their effects, but we know some thing's not right. And so, a long branch of research goes into making things taste sweet. Nonetheless, all testing is on animals...      Why is this in a Veg and vegan section?

Only glass or plastic it acceptable and preferably glass.  Taste it a day or two after canning.  The taste may have changed due to the heat necessary to can it.    If the recipe is very high in vinegar and the people are going to use the sauce fairly quickly I would just bottle it and mail it to the immediately.  With a lot of vinegar it will safe to use for a couple weeks.    If you want to share your hot sauce recipe please see the link below.

18d121d01c136ac0f12ff28e4139c812aa	I don't like the one with wasabi either.  I have this recipe  Asian Snack Mix and one more:  I guess you can just use dried peas.    4cups Corn Chex? cereal  4cups Bugles? original corn snacks  2cups chow mein noodles  1cup pretzel sticks  1cup salted peanuts  6tablespoons butter or margarine  1teaspoon garlic powder  2tablespoons soy sauce  1package (1 oz) chow mein oriental seasoning mix  1cup dried peas      1.In large microwavable bowl, mix cereal, corn snacks, chow mein noodles, pretzels and peanuts and dried peas.  2.In microwavable measuring cup, microwave butter uncovered on High about 40 seconds or until melted. Stir in garlic powder, soy sauce and chow mein seasoning mix with wire whisk until well mixed. Pour over cereal mixture, stirring until evenly coated.  3.Microwave uncovered on High about 5 minutes, stirring every 2 minutes, until mixture looks dry and crisp. Spread on paper towels; cool 15 minutes. Place in serving bowl; stir in wasabi-coated peas. Store in airtight container.  Oven Directions: Heat oven to 250F. In ungreased large roasting pan, mix cereal, corn snacks, chow mein noodles, pretzels and peanuts. In 1-quart saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Remove from heat. Stir in garlic powder, soy sauce and chow mein seasoning mix with wire whisk until well mixed. Pour over cereal mixture, stirring until evenly coated. Bake uncovered 50 to 55 minutes, stirring every 15 minutes, until mixture looks dry and crisp. Spread on paper towels; cool 15 minutes. Place in serving bowl;  Store in airtight container.      Peas:  2 cups dried whole peas  2 tablespoons olive oil     2 tablespoons tahini  2 tablespoons rice vinegar  2 teaspoons Dijon mustard    I N S T R U C T I O N S  Soak the peas in water to cover overnight.    Preheat the oven to 200. Drain the peas, then cook them according to instructions on the package. Mix the olive oil with the cooked peas until well coated.    Oil a baking sheet and spread the peas evenly across it. Place in the oven and bake for 5 hours, until the peas appear dry and are crisp when bitten into.    Combine the  tahini, rice vinegar and mustard in a mixing bowl.    Combine the mixture with the hot peas making sure that all the peas are evenly coated.    Using a rubber spatula, spread the peas on the baking sheet, separating as many as you can. Increase the oven temperature to 250. Bake the peas for 10 to 15 minutes, until the coating is dry.|`|cfdc405defe60d37e2129e3f90174096aa	The coating is a sprayed on starch coating like the way they make jelly beans and gum balls, you can flavour it with anything, wasabi is on flavour, you can use sugar, chili's, garlic. I buy the unseasoned ones at a Bulk food store here in Toronto Canada.    I would say look for the plain dried or salted peas, check Asian stores or large big box stores.
NXAk99qWaa	Even though some of the other answers are pretty funny, the correct answer for a Bloody Mary made with Rum is 'Cubanita'.    2 shots light white rum  4 shots pressed tomato juice  ? shot freshly squeezed lemon juice  8 drops tabasco sauce  4 dashes Worcestershire sauce  ? spoon horseradish sauce  2 pinch celery salt  2 pinch black pepper    Shake all of the ingridents with ice, fine-strain into an ice-filled glass, and garnish with a wedge of lime.    There are some other variations too... a Bloody Mary made with Scotch is called a Bloody Joseph; when made with Tequila it's a Bloody Maria; when made with Gin it's called a Red Snapper; when made with Sake (rice-wine) it's called a Bloody Maru; when it's made with Mott's Clamato (clam juice) it's called a Bloody Caesar; and as I've just mentioned, when it's made with Rum it's called a Cubanita.

Flour & wheat sealed in 5 gal. containers.  Some items we buy in bulk when it is on sale, canned fruit, veggies, stews, etc and those we rotate through.  We buy the cases when the stores have a "caselot" sale and then use them, restocking when there is the next sale.     We have lots of dried/dehydrated items that store well for long periods of time, rice, beans, soups, etc.      Organization isn't really hard.  I have my kitchen pantry with items I use every day.  When I use up some canned good, I have my garage pantry where my extra is stored.  Some of the items packaged and sealed for long term is kept in the basement.  Oh, and we have a deep chest freezer but that's not so much food storage.  We just buy a side of beef and 1/2 a pig every year so the meat goes in the freezer and is used until gone then refilled.     Not a big deal.|`|flIpDJMzaa	I think you answered your own question.

X5hLhGKEaa	Here's the answer to your question.    These are the steps:    1. Fold four pieces of paper towel into a stack.  2. Place the paper towel stack onto a microwave-safe plate.  3.Place the pizza onto the paper towel and place the plate into the microwave.  4.Set the timer for 45 seconds, keeping an eye on the pizza.  5.Remove the plate from the microwave when the time is up.  6.Discard the paper towel, and check the pizza. If you are unsatisfied with it, repeat steps 2-6.    Tips:    - Make sure your microwave is set on high.  - A microwave with a revolving tray works the best to cook the pizza thoroughly and evenly.  - Not all pizza cooks the same so keep a close eye on the pizza.  - Time may vary depending on the power of your microwave.  - Dont use the same paper towel if you choose to reheat the same pizza again, because it will still be moist.  - Let the pizza sit for 30 seconds and reheat quickly for a more firm crust.    WARNING:    ---> Don't use tin foil in the microwave, or any sort of metal.    ---> Be careful; the food may be hot.    ---> Dont get frustrated if your pizza comes out soft, the microwave is just a quick solution.      I think that's all!    Hoped I helped you!|`|7LsSijAEaa	you heat it in the oven....  much better....  and you can heat it both....|`|7VfWz7zyaa	Read the instructions.|`|ur3vgbXoaa	Please don't.    If you don't have an oven,   the way to heat a pizza   is to put it on a skillet   sprayed with Pam or barely greased   and turn the skillet on low/med   and warm it TILL THE CHEESE  STARTS TO MELT.    The crust will be crispy   and so delicious you will   never heat it any other way.|`|3YiZ63OVaa	I don't reccommend nuking pizza, it usually comes out soggy, stick it in the oven until the crust is a golden brown.|`|pZ9eA5rYaa	It makes it rubbery. Cook it in the oven.|`|J2Y5zx4Saa	Well first let me point out that you might get better results if you put it in the oven at like 350 or so until the cheese melts and all. If you still want to do it in the microwave most brands will have instructions on the box however if they dont, I would put it in for a minute or two, check it, and keep an eye on it while you put it is for however long you think it needs. It depends on your microwave really.
xsNDfHc5aa	Haha, i've always wondered this too.  I think there's more or less only one thing that is bad for you that tastes good, and that's sugar. For some reason sugar has to taste so good. Most things that are bad for you have sugar in them. And I dunno... maybe good food have some special gross ingredient?? lol|`|MS6IzOPLaa	Because they aren't being prepared correctly. Some people can make anything taste yummy!|`|X4uQ75P7aa	Well everyone has there own opinion on different tastes. Something pleasant for someone else may be crappy for you. For example you see a painting, you might love it but another guy hates it. See?|`|jhkOpfM8aa	cause their not full of sugars and flavorings and all that stuff that the government puts in everything else :D|`|AA11394457	It's in our genetic make up to like foods full of fat and sugars in order to have enough energy.  Unfortunately our bodies haven't evolved as fast as our lifestyles, which don't require as much energy as we once did.    Since the food that is now good for our lifestyle lacks fats or sugars we're not supposed to eat them from the point of view of our bodies which they still think we're stil foraging and hunting :)|`|FbykwFypaa	You could argue that, in general, fruit is the healthiest type of food out there and I think most people would agree that fruit tastes pretty damn good.

You can make a salad with green veggies with a sweet dressing using honey or something similar .

6f6b93ac3e1feaddb02034fd127c13a7aa	One of two reasons:    1.  The oven door was opened before the misture was fully baked.  Cold air into the oven lowers the temperature and the m,ix collapses.    or    2. The mixture was not fully baked before removal from the oven.    When ready, a sponge should bounce back gently when pressed with a finger.|`|8nmEXGctaa	Your sponges need to be cooked slightly more, maybe it would be an idea to turn the temperature down slightly and give the sponge longer to cook.  Also be careful with opening the oven for to long when checking on the cooking process.|`|jPDzVVHQaa	From my experience this only happens when the mixture is not cooked all the way through... try cooking them for a little longer|`|45ae879c8612dab66b55d809753dd2d1aa	Because the mix is still not cooked through. Do the skewer/ cocktail stick test.     Put the skewer or very clean smooth knife into the centre of the cake for just a moment.  If it comes out clean, then it has finished being baked.     But I like soggy cakes anyway..  there is nothing lost here.|`|MJRzk1EXaa	I'm not positive what you're referring to as sponges, but my thoughts went to angel food cake. If it is an angel food, it needs to be cooled upside down. Some pans have legs built into the top of the pan to support it when flipped over. I've always gotten something like a wine bottle (must be glass bottle) to invert it on placing the neck of the bottle into the center hole of the pan.     Angel food cakes are full of air and gravity will deflate if allowed to cool right side up.    Hope this is the answer you were looking for!    :)

Bisquick  Salt and Pepper  Milk  Dash of soy sauce  (you can add other seasonings of your choice depending on your tastes (paprika, red pepper, italian seasoning, seasoned salt, etc.))    Basically start with the Bisquick and add salt and pepper a little milk and a splash of soy sauce.  You want the batter to be very thick.  Mix well.  Cut up pieces of boneless skinless chicken breast into nuggets or strips.  Deep fry like you would french fries until done.  The batter will be thick enough that it sticks to the chicken well.  When it hits the hot oil, the batter almost instantly seals, so you get a nice puffy coating on the chicken.  Don't put too many in at the same time, or you might cool the oil down too much.    This is a different take on chicken nuggets, but it is easy and they turn out pretty good.  An old roommate you used to make these all the time.

In a medium bowl, mix together broth and juice of 1 lemon, and pour mixture over chicken in skillet. Reduce heat to medium low and let simmer for about 8 minutes. Place on serving platter, and garnish with fresh lemon slices and parsley sprigs.

hT7BhNamaa	Hi Amy, for a nice pasta you will need  to do the following:  Dice one onion  Finely chop about a quarter of cup of Italian parsley  finely chop 2 cloves garlic.  In a pot heat aproxametly 3 tablespoons of either olive oil or vegetable oil and add your onions and parsley first and let them saute, as the onion goes a clear on the turn add your garlic. Saute further for a minute, add your ground beef, about a 3/4lb make sure it's not overly lean, and brown well. As that beef is browning in a dish crush by hand one can of Italian whole tomatoes here I add while I am crushing, freshly ground black pepper, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon oregano.    Stir the ground beef break up any lumps, add a half glass of a good red wine you like to drink. Allow to cook a further 2 to 3 minutes, add your tomatoes. and stir through, in the same dish add the same amount of water to pick up any left over tomato add that to the pot. Bring to the boil, then reduce to a medium heat for about 15 minutes, then simmer till the sauce reduces. As the sauce reduces taste for seasoning, add to your taste. I allow my sauce to simmer for over an hour, till it hasn't got that watery consistancy, there will be some oil on top but it's okay stir that in. For your pasta, large pot 3/4 fill with water add a table spoon of salt, bring to the boil and add your pasta.    I don't go for this Al Dente garbage, I go by the texture thats suits me, when it is cooked enough for me then I drain well return to put, ladle some sauce and mix with the pasta, and serve adding another 1/2 ladle of the sauce on top. as for the cheese I use Parmisan, others prefer Pecorinno, matter of choice really.     Now off you go and have fun..

Meanwhile, cook the pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water until al dente, tender but still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes, or to package directions. Drain, reserving 1 cup of the cooking liquid.   Toss the pasta with the vegetable mixtures in a large bowl to combine. Toss with the cherry tomatoes and enough reserved cooking liquid to moisten.

AA11101968	Take all the food out and clean it thoroughly with a bleach/water mix.|`|PI1S0PLUaa	Before you start cleaning, take out all the food and check every single item to see what is out of date and could be thrown out - you might be surprised at what you find! You should then take all the removable parts of the fridge out and place them in or by the sink for washing.    This includes the drawers, the racks and any compartments on the door which are removable. Wash them in hot, soapy water, removing any food debris and other stains. While these parts are dripping dry, you can set about washing out the inside of the fridge.     This can also be done with a bucket of soapy water and a cloth or sponge, don't use scouring materials or harsher cleaning fluids than washing up liquid. Make sure you clean right into the corners, get rid of any food that has dropped down, and clean any other compartments that are non-removable.     Rinse with warm water, then replace all the pieces you removed earlier which should now be dry - if not, wipe them down with a towel or paper towels. You can now replace the food in the fridge, but make sure you give bottles and jars a wipe before they go back in, as sometimes they can get sticky.    Store an opened box of baking soda in your refrigerator and freezer to help eliminate odors. Replace at least every three months, although the box may need replacing sooner if it begins to absorb too many odors. Try dating the box to help remember to replace.    Hope this helps!|`|XHnpraaxaa	First remove all the things in fridge than sort out what you do not need or what may of gone bad and ditch it.  Wash the fridge out with baking soda water and dry it.

As another answer pointed out, the drain might be plugged.  If it is not, then the pan UNDER the refrigerator could have accumulated some of the stuff that is giving off the odor.    You'll have to take off the decorative grill at the front bottom, then slide the pan out of the holder.  I've done this after I cleaned and it had liquid in it, and it can be messy, so go slow and smooth with it.  Dump any liquid, of course, and wash it with detergent.  Wipe it down with bleach.  Rinse it, dry it completely, then let it air for the rest of the day.    Make sure any liquid that may have drained from the fridge while you were working on the pan is cleaned up.  I generally put a towel under there to catch any little drips while I clean the pan.    Dust the dry clean pan with baking powder after it is completely dry.  Pull out the towel,  and return the pan to its position.  Snap the grill back into place, and you should be good to go.|`|M1oorJ62aa	Clean it out, scrub it down with bleach or disinfectant  Get a box or fridge clip of baking soda and it will make your fridge smell better :)|`|9CN0otoQaa	Check the bottom.

If you want to attract wild deer, elk, or moose to your property, put out a salt lick.    Butterflies are also attracted to salt.

Be sure to get your oil hot, at least 350 degrees.|`|6f4f7d14ae8b69e50ccaf068c55c7152aa	I use a pan on the stove.     The size of the pan depends on what I am frying.    Using a larger pan is more costly than using a smaller pan because it requires more oil.     I try to economize where it makes sense.       Ideally, a narrow pan filled half way with oil is the safest.    That way you are consuming less oil but still have a lot of room to avoid oil spils (fires).   This is the downside of stovetop deep frying.   You need to be very careful.     I actually keep my extinguisher a bit more handy whenever I deep fry stove top.      ----edit---    Somebody above suggested a dutch oven.    Do you realize that you can almost afford a new fryer for the money you will be spending on the amount of oil you need for frying in a dutch oven.    My dutch oven is 12 quarts.   Even 1/3 of the way up is using a gallon of oil.

Hae9aZCRaa	Like all diets, balance and exercise is important. Although being vegan is inherently a healthy life style, there are still bad eating habits that follow like over indulgence of carbohydrates. Expecting to loose a couple pounds "by next week" would depend on your commitment to exercise, calorie/fat intake, and so many other variables.     Continue your diet and remember to exercise: 60-90 minutes a day for weight loss, 30-60 minutes to maintain your current weight.|`|wEbB1FuNaa	If you have the proper excercise and everything yes. Just eat what you normaly eat and exercise an hour a day and you should lose weight quick. swimming or running|`|1d2d0fb9a5ef712a04bd7b849e5611a1aa	In general I would say yes.  As long as you either eat less calories, or exercise or do both than for sure you can easily lose those 2-3 pounds.  I vary by a pound every other day or so just depending on what I eat and if I exercise enough.  You could also just try replacing a portion of your meal with a salad (obviously not just one of iceberg lettuce) and that would be filling and less calories than whatever else you were going to eat.

THANKS.i MADE 7 BATCHES|`|KWhKwgsSaa	My Grandmother made the same kind of frosting -- it was like having two desserts in one.  She cooked hers on top of the stove ... this is the closest I can find to her recipe (this one is for a recipe titled "Fudge Cake of 1920"):    2 1/2 cups sugar  1/2 cup cocoa  1/2 cup milk  2 teaspoons vanilla    Combine first three ingredients in saucepan over medium heat, stir and bring to a boil -- let boil for one minute.  Remove from heat, add vanilla.  Beat with mixer until cool.      You have to work fast with this because it gets hard as it cools.    Here is another one I found while searching the internet:  Fudge Frosting    2 squares unsweetened chocolate  1 cup sugar  2 tablespoons flour  1/8 teaspoon salt  1/3 cup milk  2 tablespoons butter  1 teaspoon vanilla    Melt chocolate, add sugar, flour and salt. When smooth, add milk and cook until it forms soft ball in cold water. Remove from heat. Add butter and vanilla. Cool, beat until consistency to spread. (It will be quite hard on the cake.)
snBeIxpBaa	Different safe methods of cooling foods quickly.    1)  Ice Water Bath  2)  Ice Paddle  3)  Blast Chiller  4)  Divining large containers of food into smaller containers  5)  Adding ice to the recipe as an ingredient  6)  If using a steam kettle, you can run cold water through the jacket to cool the food.    For larger operations  1)  Plate freezing system  2)  Air-blast freezers (basically large blast chiller)  3)  Scraped surface heat exchangers    4)  immersion freezing system        There are many, many ways to cool/heat a product, most operations use a combination of steps that I listed to assure the product is cooled quickly, safely, and to ensure quality.      How to heat large batches of food  1)   Convection Ovens (key word is convection: forced air current)  2)  Thinly slice/spread the item, thinner items take less time to heat/cool than thick items.  (Works with chilling as well)  3)  Microwave         There are more ways to heat/cool large batches of foods.. but it depends on what type of product to determine what method is best used.|`|6QJe4Mlyaa	The method would depend on what you are making. Here are some ideas:  Chilling:  Soup.  During prep omit some of the water called for in the recipe.   When the soup is done add ice to make up for the water that was omitted.  The addition of the ice will rapidly cool the soup.  then divide the soup into smaller shallow containers and refrigerate.  This method will work for any product that has a lot of liquid as a base.  For salads.  Refrigerate all ingredients the night before this includes onions, celery, if making tuna salad open can and drain overnight in refrigerator, covered obviously this way when assembling the salad all items are at proper temp.  Make sure the mayo is cold as well.  Chill sticks are also available to help cooling.    Heating:  Heating items, stir to make sure the heated portion is evenly distributed as rapidly as possible.  If you have to add a liquid to an item if possible bring the liquid to temperature before adding.  If you are adding meat balls to a sauce make sure they are hot do not add to a sauce cold expecting the sauce to bring a frozen or cold meat ball to temperature rapidly.   Hope this gives you some ideas.  You might want to call the local Health Department and ask to speak with an inspector, explain you are in a class and ask what they suggest be done in restaurants.|`|AA11394457	We have blaster chillers, that bring down the temperature of food very fast; and as for heating there's your microwave, although it can be hit a miss, especially if it's food that can't be stir to avoid the hot spots that occur in microwaved food.|`|BYVjRuhXaa	Of course you can always use a microwave or for cool use ice water.

doz7RIoeaa	Being involved in the animal welfare movement is not limited to protesting or physically rescuing animals. In fact these type of activities are the most reviled and probably the least successful in terms of animals saved.     But all organizations function like a company and as such need the same type of people you would see in an office.   So accountants, lawyers/lobbyists, business graduates etc all can find a careers in environmental and animal welfare organizations such as Greenpeace, WWF etc and yes, even PETA.  Sciences include Zoology,Biology, Marine Biology etc. And then after that, you can move on to Veterinary Medicine.   And really, you don't need to enroll in any specific course of study to be active.

BWxSSADaaa	Dude, bring some home-made Indian spiced chicken breast, + some raita.  Add that to your hippy salad, and you have awesomeness.  Here's a recipe for home made spicy kabobs.  My mom makes a bunch of them and then freezes them in portions (raw).  You can then thaw a portion and cook it when you want.    Chicken Boti Kabobs    Ingredients:  2 lbs of cubed chicken breast  2tsp. tomato paste   1/2 tsp salt  1Tbsp minced fresh ginger  1Tbsp fresh minced garlic  1 tsp red pepperflakes (or minced serrano to your taste)  1 tsp chili powder  1Tbsp lemon juice  1-2 Tbsp oil, 3 -4 Tbsp of chopped fresh cilantro    Mix all that well in a large bowl.  Marinate the chicken cubes in it.  Placing the cubes in a large plastic bag works well to distribute the marinade well.  Let them sit at least a few hours, but overnight will give you unbelievably tender and tasty chicken.  Skewer them (or not) and bake/broil or grill.      Like I said, you can freeze them raw in one-portion bags, and then thaw and cook them the night before.  Take a bagful of cooked kabobs with you to work!    You can make an easy raita to take too, just mix a couple tablespoons chopped cucumber with a little minced garlic, and 1/2 c plain yogurt.  Season with salt and pepper.    At work, open crappy hippy salad, top with tasty chicken, use raita as a dressing.|`|xrRZeROmaa	This is after all, the food section, and the modern trend in these difficult economic times is to carry a sack lunch.

geih5vR8aa	I would do the onion, chicken and BBQ sauce by itself at first. The sauce shouldn't burn, if it's a slow cooker, but I would throw some chicken stock in it, to make sure it doesn't dry out. maybe a 1/2 cup, to 1 cup, depending on how much you are making.    The potatoes depend on how big you're going to leave them. If you make them bite size, then leaving them in a slow cooker for 4 hours is going to turn them to mush.    Best is to just roast your potatoes little red potatoes or yukon gold in the oven, around the last hour or so of cooking time on the chicken.  Just make 1 inch thick bite size pieces and put them in a large ziplock bag, and add some olive oil, salt and pepper, and rosemary, minced garlic and balsamic vinegar (which is a great marinade, or balsamic vinaigrette dressing). Mix it all up, and put it on a baking sheet.    Now you have all this great chicken, and you can eat it with healthy, tasty potatoes one night, then tomorrow, if you have leftover chicken, you can put it in a sandwich role, and have an awesome BBQ chicken sandwich.|`|bv5kbxvUaa	I'm not sure about BBQ flavored potatoes haha but if that's what you like...I think it should be fine  Good luck...|`|BhFeii5Xaa	The nice thing about slow cookers is that you can toss everything in and turn them on and ignore them til dinner time.    Stack your foods into the cooker in any order you like or stir them all up.    Just make sure you have sufficient liquid in the cooker to prevent burning! They make nice liner things now to keep cleanup to a minimum!! Burnt on BBQ sauce is not nice to remove from your crock!|`|bb8h33w8aa	Oh yeah, I usually wait until there is about 2 hours left for cooking on the meat, then throw a bunch of potatoes and carrots in.  That way they all finish cooking together.      As far as the BBQ sauce, you can put that in as soon as you add the chicken.|`|Cgq1d3nJaa	I would put the onions and potatoes in first, then the chicken right on top of them.  You might need a little liquid to keep from burning, but the chicken will release some as it cooks.  I think putting all in at the same time will be fine.  I personally would add the bbq sauce later, but it is up to you.  The bbq sauce really does not need to cook and you don't want it burned.|`|byScRN6baa	put it all in at same time|`|RrmkaKJlaa	Yes.  The best way to use the Crock-Pot (Slow Cooker) is by putting the chicken and vegetables in at the same time.  BBQ sauce...you might want to add a wee bit of water to that (depending on quantity of food...as much water as sauce I guess) or else it will be the sauce that burns, not the meat and potatoes.  Once you have figured out all your ingredients, give the whole thing a toss, and let it cook on LOW for 6 to 8 hrs.    You may want to add garlic, mushrooms or carrots to add variety.  Try not to lift the lid till the end of cooking time, this will cause the heat to leave and then it will take longer to cook.

OzHEtokmaa	Yes it works - have done it many times. Cook the chorizo first and you will release the flavoured oil which you can then cook the scallops in. As long as you dont use too much chorizo you wont overpower the scallops. The eggs might be more at risk of being overpowered........could try something different in texture - broad beans perhaps (Gordon recommends).  If you think chorizo too strong then try wrapping the scallops in some parma ham and cooking  - tastes fab  Sarah|`|CMSbqweCaa	sounds nice can i come and try a bit!!!    lol|`|AA11394457	Absolutely, just make sure the chorizo is not a very hot one or it will overpower the dish flavour.|`|bZud91iuaa	I'm thinking why would you waste the flavor of scallops with chorizo?  Scallops have the delicate sea flavor and chorizo is way too overpowering for them, in my opinion.  May I suggest two appetizers?    1. Cut a square of thick artisan bread about 2"x2" toast 1/2 inch thick.  Lay a slice of broiled Chorizo on the toast with a poached quail egg and drizzle with a little hollandaise sauce, kind of like a chorizo benedict. Garnish with either sliced green onions or chives, a dash of sea salt and fresh ground pepper.     2. Pan sear the scallops in a little butter and hot oil.  Season the scallop with salt & pepper first.  Place a piece of butter lettuce on your serving plate, then place the cooked scallop on the lettuce.  Top with a poached quail egg.  Splash a little sweeter wine, johannisberg or chenin blanc or orange muscat in the sautee pan you cooked the scallops in and deglaze the pan. Pour over quail eggs and scallops.  Drop some chopped parsley on top and serve.|`|yPTUG6uNaa	Yes it will.. try it|`|fBti22TAaa	Sounds interesting.  Go easy on the chorizo, maybe.|`|PPyMhRJAaa	Yes, it would. Just slice the chorizo very thinly as it is quite strong. Serve with a small side salad and a balsamic dressing.|`|cfdc405defe60d37e2129e3f90174096aa	I am a former chef and have had these ingredient in Spanish Tapa's, you could combine them or prepare them separately and served together on the same plate.    I would suggest to saute them, and as the one person said place the eggs on a toast cushion and grilled chorizo, and pan fry the scallops with a bit of garlic, olive oil and butter, with a splash of Tio Pepe sherry.|`|0EdCuOYjaa	Chorizo is strongly flavoured and would overpower the delicate flavour of the scallops|`|V8IRppHPaa	Ewww   Good Old Prawn Cocktail I Say  :)

You can also do a stuffed potato which in my opinion is better than a baked potato, where you bake the potato, scrape out the inside, mash up the potato with butter, sour cream, cheese bacon bits and green onion then put it back into the oven for a few minutes.  There is also some dressings that you can find at certain stores, that when put over veggies it makes them taste soo yummy.. the one I use is from a local guy but it would probably say on the label :) or im sure you could just use ranch or something   Hope this helps|`|eq4fZWYgaa	make chopsuey. use butter.|`|AA11802563	Marinade them in a jerk sauce or olive oil for about 15 minutes, add seasoning, and grill them over medium heat.

VO1EuYqyaa	I smoked for about 3 years and I'm cutting down (not really trying to, I just don't care anymore) and I've been smoking one cigarette a day usually at like 11pm & I get a nicotine buzz on that one cigarette daily. I'd think the buzz will probably stay, mine did.|`|ZNTLSCLhaa	I've gone all day without a cigarette and smoked one at night and got a major buzz.  I think it depends on the person and how much they smoke though.|`|Xt7jo8bcaa	No|`|EPIELNBuaa	i use to only smoke when i drank socially, everytime i had a cigarette, for 3 years, i got a buzz. it may be different for different people or just the brand. i smoked marlboro lights everytime back then.   ive switched brands alot since then and am now a multiple pack a week smoker, so i no longer get a buzz.
PhPOLgHGaa	they are not necesarrily deep fried, they are just tossed in the wok and stir fryed in with the rest of the ingredients is all... i have watched them make this before at the one place i go to, they cook right in front of ya. its pretty kewl.    as far as the type of noodle i think it kinda varies on the place the one i go to uses a rice noodle or a veracelli to a thin spaghetti noodle at the other one.|`|6DTA1zpSaa	Hunan kung Pao Chicken  http://cooking-service.synthasite.com/?q...|`|byScRN6baa	udon or rice noodles

y1TDricRaa	there is nothing wrong with that. People just crave different things.  And i actually think that is the because you are eating really healthy.|`|1cYPOJkqaa	Cravings are usually your body telling you what you need to eat. So if you crave green veg, you may be low on iron. I crave bananas when my potassium levels are low.|`|ZA6O9qfBaa	There are a lot of vitamins and minerals in vegetables that your body craves and needs. It could be your body's way of telling you you need more of a particular vitamin.|`|V68pg9fkaa	lots of people crave lots of differnt things. I wouldn't particulary worry because craving fruit and veg isnt exactly a bad thing. In fact, its propbably your body telling you to eat more fruit and veg as you were not eating enough before|`|MbSSIOpSaa	Your body knows what it needs! That's a good thing.|`|b9wICW1Paa	Its a conditioned response, just like all other cravings we develop.  Fortunately this is one that you should be grateful for.  Congratulations, I wish I had such cravings instead of for sweets.|`|FaKUw9oSaa	DON'T QUESTION IT!|`|yYvFF2fDaa	Everyone has different taste buds. Did your parents feed you lots of veggies when you were growing up?     You must have really know how to cook the veggies to be craving them.|`|AA12070832	When I went vegan i started to crave and prefer fruits and vegetables of all kinds over all the unhealthy junk I had been feeding myself. I remember there was like a week where I craved broccoli, hummus and pita bread. I actually managed to kick my sugar habit, my chocolate habit and a lot of other things. I actually prefer the natural sweetness found in fruits to the added sugars in processed junk. They say it only takes 21 days to change your taste buds. It works.
1dHTr3rkaa	It will be fine.  I make my lasagna with both type of noodles and cook neither one.  Since I keep my lasagna in the oven for about an hour and when I layer the lasagna I start with the sauce in the bottom and then put the noodle on top; there is enough liquid to help with the cooking.  And if your unsure, after an hour put foil on top so the cheese does not continue to cook; turn off the oven and just leave it in there until time to serve.|`|WKKdQq2Aaa	Well if you're gonna eat some lasagna you better pop open a delicious bottle of Chianti to go with it! And please, drink the whole bottle :D|`|4b81a16cbb26c3702aa40a16058d31e4aa	First off, calm down...  Take a breath...    LOL    They are simply pre-cooked noodles that are meant to save you time a and hassle, not give you a coronary infarction in the process.    But, in the time that it took you to fire up your puter, sit and panic and then continue your obvious panic waiting for answers from people thousands of miles away, you probably could have gone back to the store with your receipt and exchanged it for noodles that were much less alarming.    Oh, and if you didn't notice, this is the Wine, Beer and Spirits section, but we're happy to help too.
Fsr2Rofzaa	I have been cookin lasagna for years and never EVER boiled the noodles.  It comes out great not cooking them b4 you bake your dish!  Don't worry it will be delicious  Check your email, I replied to you!  :)  Hope I'm not too late|`|8VtNGFjAaa	Oh those work good, less hassle.  Taste just the same!|`|7e481fa185347d9470c5a0cdb6150c8faa	I haven't used that brand before but I have used the no boil noodles before and they work just fine. As long as you follow the directions on the box.    Good Luck. Hope it works out for you!|`|AA11711488	Yes it's fine a lot of lasagna sheets don't need pre-cooking. I'm a chef and we use Brevetta and it works fine just add a bit more liquid to stop it going dry and cook on a lower temperature.|`|hF81dr9Caa	I used the "no bake" once, and would never use them again.....Only for the simple fact that I did not allow for the moisture it would take from the sauce.    If you plan on using them,  make sure your sauce is wetter than usual.  You need to allow for amount of moisture that your noodles will need.

AA11173395	No type at all.  Vegetarians do not eat animals, fish and chicken are animals.  You're an omnivore.  Just say "I don't eat red meat."|`|6f4f7d14ae8b69e50ccaf068c55c7152aa	Labels are unimportant.     They only serve to pigeon hole people into categories that others can use to exploit.        If you eat meat, you will not be considered a vegetarian and i am sure many people will remind you of that fact.|`|hVEGaRMbaa	You are a Zombietarian and Laura E is an Octopusarian!|`|AA12334360	No, you are not a type of vegetarian because you eat meat    you are not a pescatarian because you eat chicken    Thats it really.    Think about it this way:    If there was a type of "vegetarian that ate fish and chicken" then it would make sense that there was a type of "vegetarian that ate beef but not chicken or fish". It would make no sense to include one type of meat but not another, so the beef-veggie would have to be allowed by your logic.    and that of course would mean that someone who eats a 8oz steak every day would be a type of vegetarian.    I don't think anyone would claim that makes sense|`|1cYPOJkqaa	No. You're not a vegetarian so there's no word for it. You're just a person who doesn't eat beef and pork.    There is no such thing as a "Demi-tarian, or a semi-vegetarian"|`|NNiN0tK0aa	NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  You are not a vegetarian.  The word vegetarian was invented by the vegetarian society to mean somebody who doesn't eat ANYTHING from the animal kingdom, including shellfish, insects and animal by products.    There are a lot of people who cut out red meat who call themselves vegetarian - my cousin included.  However these people are posers who are ridiculed by both the vegetarian community (who want to to scream over it) and by meat-eaters.  Vegetarians get very frustrated by these people, meat-eaters tend to insult them with rude names.  Because there are a lot of people doing this, the terms pescatarian, pollotarian, and pollo-pescatarian were invented.  However you really don't need a label.  Lots of people cut out wheat - they don't need a label.  Lots of people cut out milk - they don't need a label.  Some people cut out sugar - they don't need a label.  If you've only cut out one kind of food - red meat - you really do not need a label.    And you are 100% definately not vegetarian.|`|p5hvth7zaa	Nope..  You still kill animals..You get no special name    Vegetarian = Veggies    =D|`|KGRikkJeaa	well then technically your not a vegitarian. you just dont eat red meats...|`|AtJgXB59aa	sorry to bust your bubble but your not a vegeterian|`|0821af06fe4e702880d804a9e2cc13e0aa	You would have to at least give up the chicken to be considered a moderate vegetarian. A true vegetarian will not eat chicken. I personally love vegetarian food and restaurants but i still occasionally eat meat but no dairy. I wish as well we could all fit in other categories but i dont think they exist. Most vegetarians that i know all come from meat eating families and are former meat eaters so i dont think they would give you a hard time. Just dont call yourself a vegetarian - yet.    I have to add i agree that a true vegetarian wont eat seafood either but some still consider them moderate vegetarians. It really does not have to be you its just a label. If you are happy and healthy with what you eat keep enjoying it and dont worry about being considered a vegetarian.  Or you could call yourself:   Flexitarian/Semi-vegetarian    I will warn you that this is not a popular label and you could be resented if you present yourself  this way!    Check this out too:  http://www.yellins.com/veg/different_typ...|`|b916f6962d68b4ccca7c451250580511aa	Nope. There is no type of vegetarian who eats chicken. Definition of vegetarian: One who does not consume animal flesh. In general, you may be able to eat fish and call yourself a vegetarian but not in my book. My book = no animal flesh period - that includes lobster, crabs and other sea life.|`|GZtdISjNaa	You're not a vegetarian, you're just a picky eater.|`|3V6VfnqVaa	A person that eats seafood but no other meats is a Pescetarian (Note: This is not a type of vegetarianism.)    A person that eats chicken but no other meats is a Pollotarian (Note: Also not a type of vegetarianism)    A person that eats chicken and fish but no other meats is a pesce-pollotarian or a pollo-pescetarian, either term is correct.|`|3SY0ObRQaa	You are not a vegetarian and should not pride yourself on using that title if you continue to eat animals.    Chickens and fish have brains and nervous systems. They feel pain just as much as cows and sheep.    If you want to call yourself vegetarian, stop eating animals. (Yes, including fish)|`|qg0J4ud8aa	a person who eats fish but no other meat is called a pescitarian (dont no how to spell that hahah) erm and there is no term for a chicken eater as well i am a lacto octo vegetarian and would not class you as a vegtarian you just dont like other meat|`|3U6hfOntaa	Actually all these on here are lying you are a type of vegetarian   It is called Demi-Vegetarian  Definition-Don't eat red meat,but eats white meat and fish.    And ill post a link in the sources box to back to up cause were learning about it in our food tech classes.not many people have heard of this type of vegetarian.    Hope i helped|`|4f9f3Flbaa	You aren't vegetarian.  Some might say that you are a pescatarian because you only eat fish, but you are definitely not vegetarian.  Vegetarians do not eat animal meats.  Some do eat eggs or consume milk products.

NbJbZXtGaa	Yes, it is safe. You should stay away from Kingfish, Tilefish, mackerel and shark, but Tuna and Salmon are okay, but limit it to about 12 ounces a week.    I would go with the salmon over tuna. Recent studies have found a link between mothers who consumed 12 ounces per week of salmon while pregnant, with better hand-eye coordination and higher IQ scores when the baby is toddler aged. It probably continues throughout life, but the study hasn't been going on long enough to know yet. Anyway, I ate a LOT of salmon when I was pregnant, and my son definitely shows the positive signs indicated in the study. So, don't be afraid to eat more fish.|`|hKlsJgVSaa	A lot of people are thinking there is no mercury in salmon and tuna but there is still mercury in there.

Here in the US, it's not really recommended. Doctors advise against it because of the risk of mercury...    But if it's something she can't stand to miss out on it's alright in moderation. It's a little risky to be eating random seafood she most likely doesnt' eat often (you know like lobster) because she could develop allergies while being pregnant.

The reason most dont eat it while pregnant is just that if they did manage to get some that wasn't prepared properly then not only would that risk the mothers life it also risks the babies life.  Most don't want to take the chance.|`|B2dQop3oaa	Why shouldn't it be? Eating fish's always been safe - apart from the tiny bones that might get stuck in your throat. A solution to that is by getting fish that already had it's bone-structure removed.    Ps: "As long as it is no more than twice a week ( because of the Mercury  found in the fish)" -> What? You're getting your fish out of the industrial areas in the Amazon river?|`|FbykwFypaa	In general, the larger the fish, the more mercury content the fish will have. Mercury isn't only present in fish that are near industrial areas, so don't be fooled by that. Many fish swim great distances over their lives.    The mercury starts in plankton, which is consumed by tiny fish like minnows. It then works its way up the food chain as the smaller fish are eaten by the larger ones. Since the larger fish like Tuna tend to live for a longer time, they accumulate much more mercury than the smaller ones.    According to the FDA & EPA, 1 in 6 women has enough mercury in their body to cause neurological damage to an unborn child. You should avoid eating fish like Sharks, Swordfish, King Mackerel, or Albacore Tuna(it has more mercury than other Tuna).    Salmon is consider "low" in mercury content, and there certainly are a lot of benefits from eating Salmon, but FDA recommendations are that you eat no more than 2 servings per week.

I would go with Stella.|`|vddPsXzIaa	Stella Artois is a good ordinary beer. Grolsh is more than that. But there are few people who understand it. If I had to choose, I'd choose both. The more the better because they are both good.|`|ZzqWzFNiaa	I've got to take the Stella pretty definitively. Grolsch is ok, but Stella is much better.|`|ai4lrclMaa	Stella Artois|`|ewUQuX4Kaa	Between these 2 it would have to be Stella Artois.  Both are green glass, so you run into the problem of light damage resulting in skunked beer. Main difference is Stella bottles have larger labels that cover more of the glass, as well as higher 6pk cartons to shield from light. This USUALLY means Stella is less funky than Grolsch.  Besides, it's quite rare in my area to find fresh Grolsch, thanks to a distributor that doesn't actually care much about the quality and freshness of the beer they sell...    (EDIT)  To clarify a point, a poster below said skunkiness isn't from the green bottle. I've been in this business for a long time and skunkiness most certainly is a result of green or clear glass. You can get skunked beer in a brown bottle, but it takes more work.  Skunky flavors and aromas are caused by UV rays penetrating glass, causeing riboflavin to interact with and break down the isohumulones (from the hops) in the beer. The resulting chemical molecule is called methyl mercaptan, which is one of the "ingredients" in a skunk's spray.  Green and clear bottles are only about 5% protective of UV light, while brown glass protects against roughly 98% of UV light.  The more protection on a green bottle, the less susceptible it is to skunking... which is why Stella isn't as bad, becuase of the larger amount of labeling on the bottles...|`|bb8h33w8aa	Stella Artois hands down.  I used to buy it by the case back in my drinking days.  Couldn't get enough of the stuff.|`|c25a030b0e651dd4cba0c4cd481c6c68aa	If I had to choose between those beers, I wouldn't drink.|`|AA11802563	I'm a Stella Fan. It's a great surf and turf beer. In fact, it goes well with anything grilled or deep fried.|`|b9wICW1Paa	Stella Artois.  Grolsch smells and tastes like skunk because of the green bottle.  It would be nice to have the bottle for home brewing, since it has the resealable cap.  But then my brew would be skunky, too.|`|8OREBeRdaa	I'd have to go with Stella.  THere seems to be a a bit of a ritual to pouring a good Stella and it does help that they serve it in a certain glass.  I do believe thought that there is a lot of marketing buzz over this beer that is in-substantiated as it isn't all THAT great.    Grolsch?  It must be Dutch for gross. I wouldn't use that stuff to clean my toilet.  In fact, it tastes like the water that's been in the bottom of a vase where the flowers have died out a couple weeks ago.  We use that beer amongst my friends as a "rite of passage" for birthdays, stags, initiations, hazings, etc.  The skunkiness is NOT from the green bottle. I've had plenty of beers out of green bottles and it doesn't make a difference.  Can, bottle, on tap - don't waste your time with this one.    Winner: Stella Artois (although there are much better beers out there - Bass or Heineken are fairly comparable, but look for your local micro-brews out there)  It's good to see you like Euro-brew

I like the plain with no sauce, just follow the recipe until the pork is cooked and eat. My hubby's favorite is Jaeger Schnitzel (Yay-gurr) That just means schnitzel with a mushroom sauce.     Jaeger Schnitzel:  4 boneless pork cutlets about 3/4 inch thick   3 tablespoons of vegetable oil   1 large onion, sliced   1 cup of button mushrooms, sliced   2 cups of beef broth   2 teaspoons of flour   1/2 cup of heavy cream   2 teaspoons of Vegetable soup base or any chicken soup base   pepper to taste      Heat the oil in a large skillet and cook the 4 pork cutlets with the onions until the meat is brown and the onions are soft. Now add one of the two cups of beef broth and soup base let it simmer for 20 minutes.   Add the mushrooms and keep simmering for 10 more minutes. Add the second cup of beef broth and begin adding the flour to thicken the sauce. You may need a bit more than the mentioned 2 teaspoons- use your discretion to get a good hearty thickness. You may want to use a small strainer or mix the flour in a glass with water first so it won't clump(could also substitute corn starch for flour if you prefer).   Add the heavy cream. Let the pork cook for a few minutes longer and then add salt and pepper to taste.   Serve with a side of mashed potatoes, noodles or spaetzle.    Or you can make one with a wine sauce from here.  http://www.grouprecipes.com/sr/30627/wie...|`|HsGj95jMaa	good recipe using pork-chops  http://cooking-service.synthasite.com/?q...|`|KWhKwgsSaa	Brown Sugar Pork Chops  Place chops in baking dish making sure not to overlap.

For 1.99 (bout same price as a quality cook-in-sauce) you get all the spices you need, a list of what else you need to buy and a step by step recipe card.    The point is that you get fabulous restaurant standard results - totally foolproof. Each one serves four so you could keep half the spices and do it again in a week or two - so thats amazing curry for 1 investment. Go on she's worth 1    They do loads including chicken tikka, bombay potatoes, tandoori salmon, jeera chicken, chicken korma, and other cuisines like cajun, jerk and thai.    We are addicted to these and usually do one a week (much more interesting than roast on Sunday)

aNlT1NRqaa	To be honest cappuccino is easier to make because the milk can bury the bitter flavors of a mediocre espresso. Keep practicing espressos until you get the flavor right, then the long black should be easy (just change the volume of water to taste). Make sure you preheat the cup with water from the machine once or twice (depending how cold the cups are) and put fresh hot water into the cup right before you pull the shot.    I love espresso and I still pull the occasional bad shot. That's when I make a cappuccino.  :)

xrRZeROmaa	You can stuff your chicken breasts in advance, and hold for several hours in the refrigerator without worrying about salmonella.  When you cook the chicken, just make sure you cook at a proper temperature.  350 F. for 20 minutes per pound, or test your breasts at the thickest part with a meat thermometer  If the breasts are 160 F., they are done.

Also, please stop drinking your wine coolers and alcopops :D  If that is what your drinking credentials consists of then you should leave this section immediately!|`|bVIewZe9aa	like acid, it makes your eyes run, and it smells like nail varnish remover, its a really strong taste, just tastes like your drinking acid.   (this is when you drink it pure)  Emma (:|`|vddPsXzIaa	Vodka is defined as tasteless and colourles spirit. The technology of vodka production from the beginning was aimed at clearing of the mixture rather than using  proper distilling equipment which wasn't available in Russia of the 15th century when vodka was invented. That's why vodka is pretty much pure alcohol plus 60 %volume of clean natural water. Vodka is good when it doesn't have any taste. It should be very cold and clean. The very word "vodka" in old Russian means "water". People drink it in shots( if straight)  for a shock and immediately after that eat smth with a strong taste - pickles, herring or meat with horseradish. I admire whiskey but there are times when nothing can replace vodka - when you come from the snowy wood, you're cold and awfully hungry...Well, I'll go and drink some...|`|ZzqWzFNiaa	It's going to sound bad, but I love vodka on the rocks. I would say it tastes like rubbing alcohol smells in a much milder and good way. It feels like it's kind of cleaning your palette and it has such a nice bite to it, the nicer it is, the smoother it is, but there is definitely a sort of cleansing quality to the taste. I've never been good at describing tastes, but that's how I would say it.|`|geih5vR8aa	Emma have you tried acid before? I'm pretty sure if you tried it, you would die... unless you're talking about the drug.  And only bad vodka tastes bad and burns your eyes, or smells like nail varnish.      A GOOD vodka will taste smooth, but generally it is mixed here in the states. It doesn't really have much of a taste, which is why people mix it. The only taste to describe it is like eating a white potato, plain, mixed with alcohol.|`|5QicX6O4aa	It really has no taste, probably why people end up so drunk on it. However, you can smell it on a person after they digested it. Very odd, isn't it?|`|3vCrx4LHaa	Rubbing alcohol. which is the first thing that came to mind when I drank it for the first time. That was a long time ago. It hits your nose like alcohol disinfectant, hits your tongue the same way, sort of a burning feeling, but little "taste". The swallow is the fieriest - it burns like cough syrup going down,Cherry cough syrup without the Cherry. It also burns your tummy, some people call it "warming", but it burns your tummy too.  Edit: Taste is different for everyone and depends on the sensitivity of your taste buds, and your palette, some people who have drank for a number of years don't have the same sensitivity to vodka's taste.|`|6U8FAY21aa	It's tastes how it smells. It's horrible!! But it goes very well with other stuff and when I drink vodka and coke I think it tastes chocolatey, lol.|`|PKBecNkGaa	it sucks|`|yGuB5SkUaa	The difference between good vodka and bad vodka is huge.  Bad vodka has a sort of rubbing alcohol taste, and it has a very bad aftertaste, that is dry and stays in your mouth.  Good vodka on the otherhand, is a lot smoother, and by smoother I mean the taste is more subtle, it doesn't have such a strong aftertaste.   IT doesn't have that "bite" at the end.  But anyways vodka is not good, the good stuff isn't worth the money.  Get a bottle of jack and call it a day.
GY4yYB6jaa	If that is really what your professor said, your professor needs an education.    Of course vegetarians and vegans breastfeed their infants. Vegans are against animal exploitation for human gain- human milk is intended for human infants. Cows milk is intended for calves. Simple.    Personally, as a vegan, I continue to breastfeed my 21 month old, and will do until she self weans, the way nature intended.|`|JsWnIi72aa	I'm a long ways away from having kids, but I will definitely breast feed my kids. It's natural and healthy.|`|ApHLa19Faa	Why not? Vegetarians drink milk anyway, and even Vegans know the difference between a human product and an animal product. What a silly question.|`|6RXSS3fFaa	Of course. Why not? Human milk is designed for human babies. I would never, ever, not in a million years, feed a child cow milk. Why? Well, cow milk has a very powerful growth hormone (IGF-I) in it and, guess what. Our bodies can't tell the difference between cow IGF-I and human IGF-I. It is the most powerful growth hormone known to science. And it makes cancers grow. Yep. It's absolutely, 100% true. Dairy can, and often does, promote cancer cell growth. This has been proven in many studies around the world (read the China Study for the background on the early discoveries of this critical bit of science fact). Excess IGF-I obtained through dairy products is very likely the cause of our cancer epidemics (especially breast cancer). "But people have ben consuming dairy for years and years and years." No. Not like we do in this day and age, honey! If you want to live a long life and you want your children to live a long life I highly recommend NOT feeding them cow's milk. Breast is best until they're ready to get most of their nutrition from solid (whole, fresh, beautiful, natural, non-animal) foods.|`|WzKrZoHQaa	Most definitely|`|VtqdeSQ8aa	Why would someone be ok w/feeding their baby milk from a different mammal and not from themselves. We have become so used to consuming milk from other animals that we don't even think about how illogical it is. If humans were supposed to drink milk and truly need it, we would breast feed from our own mothers for years. Does that make you gag? Then why drink milk from another species when it is meant for that animals baby? Humans are the only animals who do this.    Im vegan and think that it is ok to breast feed or to use soy formula if you can't breast feed or choose not to for personal reasons.|`|EApHtKr6aa	Children which are breast feeded are much healthier and they grow faster.I also think  while breast feeding , the mother gets closer to his child|`|F3LBgfvwaa	I plan to, yes. I personally believe it's best for babies.    Some women formula feed because of convenience or they can't produce enough milk or their baby doesn't latch or maybe other reasons...and if a vegetarian doesn't BF I imagine it's for those same reasons, not based on any vegetarian principle. Breast-feeding is perfectly acceptable to all vegetarians and vegans, they are terribly misguided if they feel otherwise.    I was reading about how some women aren't comfortable breast-feeding because they and our society only see the human breast as a sexual object. This has nothing to do with vegetarianism, but it's an interesting concept.|`|fhyYh3Dzaa	Yes absolutely. It was designed for them after all.|`|f1AvsgCDaa	booby milk has alot of nutrients that babies need|`|A5gfxSyzaa	When I have kids I totally will.  It gives them more immunity against disease, reduces their chance of developing allergies, and adds to the mother/child bond.|`|1cYPOJkqaa	Defiantly. I will when I have kids in 15 or so years time. Human milk is designed specifically for babies, it has nutrients and benefits that can't be reproduced in a powder form. Even if I wasn't vegan I still think breast milk is healthier. And it can help keep costs down and is safer because you don't have to worry about sterilising bottles and stuff.
OzHEtokmaa	Is gorgeous - spicy but in a tasty way rather than blasting hot. Fajitas are lovely - wraps with meat and veg inside in a spicy sauce. The nacho chips are wonderful - as a starter covered with tomato salsa, guacamole (made from avocado) and cheese. It really is scrumptious and there are countless other dishes - my favourite is a tortilla which is a shell (like a thin pastry) filled with spiced meat and salad.  Enjoy!

Ny79udz1aa	I read the previous answers with interest, but I think that few ken what a ham shank is. Use one save the other in the fridge 'til next week. Steep dried green peas or split peas in plenty of cold water over night. Get the soup pot out and put your ham shank in and bring to the boil with plenty of water4/5 pints or so. You'll get quantities on the side of the packet the peas came in. Once through the boil add the drained peas, return to the boil for a minute ,then reduce to a low simmer. After an hour, slice up a couple of leeks pretty fine and add to the soup. Grate a couple of carrots in now too, for sweetness and colour, and take off the heat after two and a half or three hours, removing the ham shank for sandwiches with the soup. It, ll be salty enough, so ca' canny with the condiments and season at the table. it reheats fine, and if you like ,a shake o' vinegar init has always improved my plateful, but may just be me.|`|61c400fd22c151ba4c4f5ed41645a3daaa	My secret to Split Pea and Ham soup is bacon....and everyone raves about my soup.

Once the soup is a green liquid remove from heat, and let stand so it will thicken. Once thickened you may need to heat through to serve.|`|GPrw1JZkaa	normally you have to soak them overnight first as they are quite salty, buy a lot of  red lentils and yellow split peas and fresh carrots fill the pan with water and boil for  about 6 hours on a low heat. oh remove the fat first. we find it is always nicer the next day.|`|CMSbqweCaa	I  have added a extra ingredient     Ham, leek and pea soup    Ingredients  1 tbsp olive oil  ? onion, chopped  25g/1oz gammon chopped  4 baby leeks, chopped  100g/3?oz fresh peas  150ml/5fl oz chicken stock  salt and freshly ground black pepper  1 tbsp double cream        Method  1.

mlmSRkhGaa	I am an experienced cook who has been in the kitchen for 50 years.  I have (two) set of Farberware.  Also, I have augmented my collection with cast iron pots which are indespensible, and casseroles and glass baking dishes, and etc.  But my central set is Farberware.  It is indestructible, cleans up with SOS pads, low maintenance, doesn't have hot spots, steel clad - so there's never rusting or chipping.  And - its inexpensive.  Ive seen the Celebrity Collections at the stores.  They either seem cheaply made to me, or too gimmicy (or the colors are grotesque)|`|9CKrP9Keaa	Look into Scanpan. It is one of the best and has a lifetime warranty. It is not made in China, Mexico or some other 3rd world country. Go to their website and have a look. I have 2 Scanpan Woks and they are the absolute best according to my Chinese wife.|`|NfGlFLCEaa	honestly, i stick with the tried and true thats been around for 100 years and that's Farberware, i have used the same set for 559 yrs, it was my mothers, passed down to me, i have never replaced 1 single pot, handle, lid....  only added to the collection.|`|B6Mfx5fUaa	I've owned the Rachel Ray set for about a year now.

I would buy the best set you can afford or one or two individual pieces of what you actually need and not a whole set if you don't need all of those pieces.      Buy the best set or pieces you can BUT buy maybe only one or two pans of non stick for the odd thing that you need that for.  You do not need non stick for all of your pots - just maybe one fry pan.    Keep another cast iron pan for frying where you don't need non stick such as for steaks or chops at high temp.     I recomend a couple of copper bottom pots, 1 large cast iron fry pan, one non stick skillet and perhaps a large capacity (copper bottom again) pot  type that could be used as a dutch oven as well.  A cast iron griddle is also something I use almost everyday.    I have never seen Farberware here maybe our version of that is Wearever - that will last for decades and you can buy it at Wallmart.

Just make sure they are fresh and have been refrigerated properly and you'll be fine.|`|2oGc1tuCaa	Yes, but don't get them from mass producers.|`|IIC9e3JQaa	fresh eggs can be - the egg's got all the things a baby chick requires to grow, so it's got good stuff there!    you've just got to be careful of raw eggs because of the salmonella risk (that's why nurseries and care homes don't serve things with raw egg)|`|rBzDJKMoaa	not really, eating raw eggs are bad but i think this is only for young children, pregnant women and old/ill people|`|3a9fab97f268dfb84b622bec18cc0cd5aa	make sure they are fresh..|`|WzKrZoHQaa	many used to eat raw eggs when I was a girl BUT with the advances in technology and Edwina Currie highlighting Salmonella and cleaning up the dairy industry as she did to aid our own health - then I'd say No.  And never if you are pregnant|`|eq4fZWYgaa	i don't think so, but i think it's olryt .. hehe ..   hm ?? y don't u just cook it ? to be safe ..|`|HsGj95jMaa	http://cooking-service.synthasite.com/?q...|`|OZRiZQg4aa	Are they good for you?, Yes, but here's the deal. 1 in 3000 eggs potentially have salmenolla. But that is from chickens which are kept in poor conditions. Your odds get better with organic free range chickens. Eating the egg raw allows your body to better fully absorb all the nutrients plus high heat alters the molecular formula of the proteins and other nutrients in the egg. there are a grip of websites that give more details.
