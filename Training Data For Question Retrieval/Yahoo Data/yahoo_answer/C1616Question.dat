20090225063947AAwIyfs	Travel;Europe (Continental);Other - Europe	Can I come back to the UK if I elope in Sweden?	Let me explain.. I am originally from America and my fiance is from London. Weve been together for two years now, weve spent alot of time apart. He came to visit me in America, spent 3 months with me and went back to England for a month, then tried to come back. Homeland security wouldnt let him into the country because they said he had spent enough time in America. After finding out how ridiculous it is to get someone an american visa we just said screw it and decided to have me move to England. The Economy got really bad in my home town back in November so I came to London to stay with him when I couldnt afford my place in america anymore. Ive been here since November trying to find a way to legally stay here and I cant find any options. They said I dont have enough time to apply for a certificate of approval for marriage because you need 3 months left on your UK status and Im only legally allowed to be here until April 15th. Ive looked into a fiance visa but there is a problem with that.. They want documents showing income, but at the moment he hasnt got any income. He got hurt a while back and needs surgery on his spine. He has been trying to get it fixed but hes been pushed back further and further by doctors. We dont really need an income at the moment because his family understands the situation and they give us a place to live, but I know immigration wont look at it that way. It says they want the past 3 years of tax statements, bank statements, pay stubs, etc. He doesnt have ANY of that, but it says Im going to need it to apply at the embassy in NY for my visa. WHAT CAN I DO?? I have no way to get married and stay because they want me to go back to america and apply first.. but I have nowhere to go, no money and no options in America. I dont want to overstay my time here because if Im caught they could ban me from England for life.      So.. Someone told me that if I go to Denmark or Sweden to get married, then come back to England I can apply for a spouse visa and I wouldnt have to go back to America.. Is that true? I cant really find anything about it online so Im hoping someone has experience dealing with this sort of thing.

20090225044531AAXgQrJ	Travel;United Kingdom;Other - United Kingdom	House in Blaenau Ffestiniog?	we used to go and stay with friends in Blaenau Ffestiniog when I was a child. We've lost touch with them now, but I would love to go back to the house we stayed in.       I think it was a converted chapel. The front rooms overlooked the mountains, but at quite a distance. The driveway was very steep and the quarry was directly behind the house. At the end of the driveway was the road, and there was a high wall (possibly a bridge) with a field below. The field had goats in, but I'm not sure if they'd be there anymore.  The garden was high above the road.       Does anyone by any chance have any ideas what the address of this might be?

They suggested going to NYC, I guess drive the 4 hours get a hotel room and see the city the next day and drive back the next night. So, where are the 3 must-eat at places, restaurant or not, where are some must see things, no museums because we'll be doing enough of that in Boston and no Statue of Liberty because I know that will take too long. And where are some cool places to walk around and soak in NY life? Thanks!

Hi,      I am looking to get some snow gear before I head to the pistes in March. I have heard good things about TK Maxx. Does anybody have any suggestions as to which would be the best store to go to? I am based in the west so Limerick or Sligo would be the most convenient but I would consider heading to Dublin.      Does anyone think that I am mad considering buying the gear in Ireland in the first place? Would I be better buying it in Austria where there is far more selection and cheap prices due to the end of the season??      Any thoughts would be cool.      Thanks

20090225050108AApZiTa	Travel;Ireland;Other - Ireland	Are Irish people turning into an obese nation?	I mean I think so. It is normal to have a few big boned people in country.   Like it is normal to have some very thin people in a country.   But I think Irish people are getting bigger of late.      I mean a bit of meat on the bone is O.K      But it is not unusual noe to see an Irish man who has a chest that would fit a DD bra cup.      I know about hormones problems, etc but not everybody has these.      I would never mock a person about their size but surly a man shaped like this would not be happy or healthy. Like some men are a normal size, then they eat a load of crap food and drink a lot and get really big.   This is not their natural size then.      Anyway a person who is naturally big does not look abnormal.      They look fine. Many naturally big people have really nice faces.   They do not have double chins at all.   It is just their body is bigger than the average.      They would look weird to be very thin.      I am on about people who are not naturally big.      It does not look nice on women too, who is not naturally that size.   It shows on their face and clings badly if they have a naturally thin skeleton.      I am sure I will get a lot of verbal abuse for asking this question.   But I think that Ireland will have a major obese problem in the future.      I have no problem with adults who are naturally big.   But do not understand people who feel the need to eat themselves into an early grave.      Cheers

This is specially in connection with the untoward actions taken by some Hindu-groups in Mangalore,in India,recently.

20090225063228AAVgv52	Travel;Canada;Other - Canada	Would Canada occupy USA if evil underground US terrorists fired rockets at them?	This is just a hypothetical “What WOULD Canada do if this did happen..”    If there were an underground HAMASS-like group firing rocket missiles from northern US states into Canada, would Canada call a meeting with Obama to combine USA and Canadian forces in the terrorist region and extract them?      If that didn’t work, Canada would call a meeting with the UN regarding a coalition effort to rid these people?      And then if that still didn’t work, the problem would not be a USA problem, right? It would be an international terrorism problem, correct?  Unless the USA helped or refused to stop the terrorism, right?  So terrorists could not alter US-Canada relations even if they tried, right?

Hi, is there an online tool most individuals use to plan a journey using public transport from point A to point B in NYC?      From reading another answer is saw a link to hopstop.com? Is this the main one of such services, is there another one that is more popular?      I ask because I know in the UK these things are called Journey Planners and you just key in where you are starting from to where you are going and the time you want to depart or arrive and it gives you a host of journey options to choose from and this is a very useful too to plan how long it will take to get somewhere.

20090225063346AACoYvu	Travel;Africa & Middle East;South Africa	Internet Prices in South-Africa - Bloody Ridiculous?	ok, so I'm married to a south-african girl, I'm from Romania...We've been living here for a while and we were thinking of spending a few months in ZA, so I thought to look for some internet pricing, as we both use the internet regularly.      Now let me tell you how things are here in Romania: I pay about 30RON, which is equivalent to 90ZAR for my internet connection (monthly). For that, i get unlimited internet, no upload/download cap and the speeds are good (2-8 Mbps on outside lines, when I download stuff from torrent sites, where most peers are in N.America/EU/Asia and 5-20 Mbps for local traffic, within Romania)      Obviously , I had a hunch that things might be a bit more expensive, seeing that South-Africa is at the tip of Africa...but then again, in many aspects SA is more developed than Romania.      When I looked for prices, I was simply amazed at those rip-off figures...Over 1200 ZAR/monthly for a connection weaker than what I've got now AND, most importantly,  12GB monthly cap.....I normally exceed that figure in ONE day.      What is wrong in South-Africa ? Who makes these rip-off prices ?? I've lived in USA and UK as well and I've found the internet to be a bit more than Romania, but not nearly as much as in South-Africa. It is an OUTRAGE !!      How do you people that live there manage ? what do you use ? maybe you've got some knowledge of companies with a more reasonable service. I'm interested in UNLIMITED traffic...is there no company that offers , to say at least 2-4 Mbps speeds, but NO monthly cap ??

I might move in to Oakland within the next month and I would like some insight on what Oakland is really about. I might move into the area around the 19th St. Oakland bart. I've cruised around there in a car and that area looks like crap, until you reach downtown. Around the 19th St. bart, shops are desserted, streets are broken, people that look like thugs around here and there.      I'm not really educated about Oakland but from what I've heard, that whole city is bad, but I need more information that are specific. I need to know which areas are really bad, which are good, what goes on during the day and what goes on at night, etc etc.

20090203144557AAYkRSp	Travel;United States;Los Angeles	Parks in or near Aliso Viejo California?(Other info. needed too)?	Parks with forests in Southern California?  I need a park near Laguna Beach. It had some forest around it.It was up in the hills.    I live here. I KNOW there aren't many forests. I went to one though. It was on the bike trail that starts somewhere around Aliso Viejo Missle School. What is it called?      The park was somewhere just below foxglove public school. It was above their baseball field. There are trees and hiking trails and foresty area. It had plaques under pretty trees that families dedicated to people- mostly children- who had died.    I just need to know if the park has a name. I am trying to write a book that involves it.      Andi-if you see this it's the one you and Mandi went to with her mom. It is near the dogpark too.      I also need to know which beach- Doheny, Capo, or whichever one it is that is next to the Dana Point Harbor, that has the big white 2.2 million Dollar houses on the cliffs above it.Or if you can tell me, I don't go there often, we go to Capo, does Laguna Beach have cliffs with houses on them?      Does anyone know the woman in white story? It is a story about a woman from the Mission in San Juan Capistrano. She commited suicide. If any one can tell me that would help.     One last thing- what is the name of the train station in (I think) San Clemente? It is sort of close to the mission. If you cross the track there are art stores. Inside the old station building are gift shops and such. And the date of the Swallows Day festival. Thanks! I know I live here but I forget things.
20090203141814AAzy7sz	Travel;France;Other - France	French / US etiquette ( reversed)?	So, some of us in this section are answering a lot of anxious questions from would-be visitors to Paris about french etiquette. As I looked at websites to reference them to, I kept finding comments from US long term visitors to France, explaining to their compatriots that some of the things that we do are not rude.       That must be true, as I can't exactly understand some of what they mean - can someone explain it, as I would also like not to be rude when I'm visiting the US.      For instance :    "In the malls, in the stores, or on the streets, people will walk right in front of you to look at something, reach for something, or simply to pass by.  This is normal, and not considered rude to the French."    http://www.franceforfreebooters.com/test...       I understand it has something to do with the notion of personal space. But I hate it too when someone stands or speaks too close to me !...  So do we have a smaller vision of personal space ?      Another interesting recurring item is "how to behave in a shop". For instance :    "In my homeland, the American West, a limp handshake with no eye contact (especially between males) often causes distrust or gives actual offense. In France, we are told (and I have verified), to fail to greet the shopkeeper, waiter or whomever ranks at the same level: a slap in the face. This is what I mean about the book: having read it, you would enter the little knickknack shop and politely say 'bonjour, madame' to the proprietrix, and give her the time of day, avoiding a pitfall you'd otherwise maybe not have known existed."      In the US, are you actually supposed to ignore the shop attendant ? (I'm not talking supermarket here), and yet say hello to a perfect stranger in the street ? Or is it actually more of a West coast/East coast divide ?      I hope I'll get nice and elaborate answers from those of you who always seem to find good excuses for our bad reputation in these pages...
