I'm right now in the process of joining the Air Force and everything is going well in that aspect.   I have been harassed for 8 months now by an ex boyfriend and he recently started harassing my brother as well. Since my brother is a lawyer, he helped me to get a temporary restraining order on my ex to stop all contact with me and my family members until the court date on Feb 13th.  My brother says there's almost no chance of us NOT getting the RTO because we have kept logs of harassing emails, texts, and phone calls as well as a text message where he hinted at a desire to rape me.      What I'm wondering is will me petitioning for this RTO disqualify me for military service?  I shouldn't think it would because I am not the one who is committing a crime, I'm only protecting myself.  I'd just like other people with more knowledge to weigh in on the subject.      Thanks in advance!

In Oct. he got a idea to run a business, so I transferred my money to his account. However,the business didn't make it. the money just stayed with him for that moment. and then we decided to buy a house. when we went to the bank to make a loan. the banker said:" it didn't make sense that his account added up so much money suddenly." So she helped us writing a due bill. and I copied it. The contents was:   I,***(my name) borrowed 20,000 dollars from ***(his name) in 1999. I will return in 2002.   and we signed the name. The banker drew a large cross over the due bill. and she said it's all set. (it's been a long time that I can't remember the detail)      Now we broke up, I asked him to give back me money, but he refused it. How can I prove that due bill was false?

Did Obama turn down the thermostat in the white house during his super bowl party, as a symbol of solidarity with those in Kentucky that have no heat, or electricity, etc. or does he just not care what is happening to Americans.  Here we have a statewide disaster and day after day I have watched the news to see if Obama cared or was going to do anything about it.  When Obama became President he was quick to slam Bush on the white house website, about how Bush handled Katrina.  Now I do not think the two disasters are an equal comparison, but Obama has not even acknowledged that it happened.  Does this mean that Americans are on their own, that Obama is only looking out for himself?

20090202223822AAvOoTz	Politics & Government;Immigration	Are there actually ''illegal'' Irish immigrants in the United States?	When I first heard this, I thought it was a mid-nineteenth century novel. Turns out, it's actually something that may or may not exist in 2009.I remember reading something about this during the presidential election. It was like a question for McCain. Someone told me there were some living in Upper Darby in Pennsylvania. Honestly, I just don't get it. When I just hear that, it sounds kind of funny. We're talking about people from a Western European country from the EU. A relatively affluent country with decent education and all that. They're really no different than us, if you think about it. Of course, there's Americans living abroad, as well as Irish, British and who ever else living abroad, but to intentionally not have your papers right in a country that seems to have a similar standard of living seems weird. Especially considering the people who they'd be living around are labeled unintellectual simpletons in their continent. Sadly, there's some truth to that, but to see there's illegal Irish immigrants in America is like saying there are illegal American immigrants in Canada. Which there probably are, although not many.      So, there's really two answers I'm looking for. Either this is not true or so insignificant, that it's meaningless. Or two, there are ''illegal'' Irish immigrants in the United States. If that's your answer, please state why you believe such. More importantly though, the question I'd ask is why.      If you're going to be illegally residing in any country, why go to one that is so far away? Why leave such a prominent region of the world to another to not live well?

My biggest fear is _________. i put snakes    My mother_____________. is a kind person    I have no tolerance____________. for terrorism.    My biggest regret is ________. using marijuana..(obviously they already know my drug use at this point in the background process)    Blacks are ________. people    Women should__________. utilize their equal rights    Most people this Asians__________. are people.    Whites ____________. are people.    I hate ________ terrorism.    I feel angry___________ at terrorism.    Jews______. are people.      Also, in another part of the test, I was asked scenario questions.    1. You and your partner are performing a traffic stop on an African American and a Hispanic in a car with no registration tag. The African American driver exits his car and is yelling at you, claiming you stopped him only because he is black. How do you respond?    I put... I would use the appropriate amount of verbal/ physical force to control the person so that I could continue with my investigation.    2. Your partner tells back at the African American man, saying "Why dont you people ever shut the hell up", and tells the man to "shut the F__k up and get your black a_s on the curb". What do you do?    I put... I would take control of the situation to avoid any further confict. I would later notify our supervisor of my partner's behavior.    Please let me know how my answers are. Thanks.

Hello there,      I was wondering after you sign your contract  is it possible to move your boot camp date up?   I'm currently a junior in high school and am planning on DEPing in either august or september. I've been talking to my school guidance counselor to see if I could take all my senior classes in the first semester, seeing how I will have a very light load.   Now me graduating early is not a guarantee so I'd still like to make my deploy date sometime in the summer of 2010.      Also if I were to graduate early then go to boot camp would I still be able to walk at my high school graduation? I would probably be at AIT, do you think they would let me come home to walk?      Thanks everyone,   Kelsey

20090202223709AAKwJWj	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Is there hope for anarchy?	I'm a strong supporter of anarcho-capitalism. I believe that the State is an unnecessary evil that employs aggression and coercion as a means of oppressing its citizens, who by right ought to be free and sovereign individuals. I also believe that the only permissible socioeconomic system under which humanity may justly thrive is the free market.   This being said, I'm a realist, and I understand that the likelihood of achieving a truly anarcho-capitalist society is nearly nonexistant. I'm fine simply advocating my viewpoints on an ethical basis alone, but at the same time I wonder if there's anything else I could do to help show people that anarchy isn't synonymous with chaos. Liberty is the mother of order, not the daughter.      What do you think is the best way to help people understand and relate to this philosophy?

First of all, yes I do like to see pictures of military women in bdus with their tops undone, outside of gays, what guy doesn’t. I also enjoy collecting military uniforms through out history (mainly 20th century combat uniforms and gear) both men’s and women’s. When I put a collection together, I like to be supper detailed with the display. That means everything from the way the uniform is put together, to what they have in their pockets (also in their web gear, rucksack, and duffle bag) and what underwear they are wearing. Granted everyone is different and every mission is different and also some items I can never get and never want to get so I have been putting a general outfit together. Sense you have to go through tones of books and what have you to get a basic idea of the personal items everyone carried or had, I figured with the late 20th century and turn of the 21st century, I could ask the actual military members. Sense I am wheel chaired bound and never be able to join up I figured there would be no harm to ask you all. Nothing perf about it and recent all you who think it is stupid. Ok so I like babes in uniform but dose that mean every thing I ask has to have some sick reason behind it? Honestly I maybe weird but how stupid are you who think I am?

I mean my only blemishes is a petty misdemeanor that I had expunged, plus I used marijuana when I was younger (approx 5 1/2/ yrs ago). Should I not even bother in cali, or do they accept the fact people are human and may not have had perfect lives and will still give someone a chance???

20090203002619AAhmTAr	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	HELP!!! Serious... No joke... How do you anonymously report someone you know is a creeper?	So in the 7th grade my friend gave me this guys screen name so she could talk to him through me.She would be on the phone and I would read what he said and type what she wanted me to.He thought he was really talking to her.Because she had known him though her sister from when she was little I figured it was ok. He was like 21.My friend was 12 and I was 11.    At first it was ok talk.About life and school and he'd give advice on our friends and what not. He caught on to what we were doing after a while. He didn't care that he was really talking to me but he was kind of upset we had lied.    After that he would just talk to me.She still talked to him but he would IM me and stuff like that.It didn't occur to me that he was unsafe. He was just like a friend who knew about life.    In 8th grade my friend had stayed home from school one day.She was home alone and decided to invite him over.Of course he went, being the way he was/is.Well they had sex.    She eventually stopped talking to him after she moved.But I still talked to him.He would say how pretty I was/am and how he wants me to go to his house and I should sneak out and go see him.Things like that.He had gradually done this so I didn't see it.He also told me about all the girls hes been with and everything else like that.    It wasn't until about December I stopped talking to him.I realized he wasn't safe and he was the reason for my fear of not sleeping at night, also because he works at the mall around me I wouldn't go.Just because I feared seeing him.No one in my family knew and I didn't want them to.    I knew he was [starting to] talk to other girls my age when I stopped talking to him [he had been talking to other girls when I did talk to him but he started talking to more and more].Now it's like every time I go on someone from  my school myspace [someone my age or younger] hes on their friends list and hes commented their pages and pictures.    I want this to all stop.I want him to leave other girls alone.I think he needs to talk to girls his own age.Hes now 23/23 and he keeps talking to younger and younger girls.It's like when one who's 14 stops talking to him he needs to get five 13 year old girls to make up for it. And whenever he stops talking to a 13 year old he needs to move to 12 year old girls.    Is there anyway I can anonymously get someone [such as a cop or foundation for this kind of stuff] to at least look at his myspace with out anyone knowing it was me who reported him?  I have a few saved messaged from him on myspace, if he does get into trouble can I send those to someone/ somewhere so they can use it as evidence that he was being inappropriate with a minor?  Can I tell someone without my parents finding out?

"The models are based on historic experience," said Mark Zandi, referring to formulas he and other economists use to predict economic behavior.

His projection last week that the House-passed stimulus measure would create 3 million jobs by the end of 2010 — scaled down from a 4 million estimate he made days earlier — have been cited repeatedly by Democrats as justification for the $819 billion legislation         So the models are based on historic experience, yet they are outside anything they have experienced historically?

I remember the day I was born of being a man of colour. he left the room and later came in and called me into the room and apologized. since then, i have nightmares. I am disturbed by that action and I am seeing a psychologist now who can get me out of that experience. but how can I help my self ,what action can I take against the lawyer?

Ever since I saw the show 'Lie To Me' I've been wanting to become a TSA agent, but since I'm schizophrenic, I don't think that people would feel comfortable with the idea of me packing heat/carrying a gun...So that's why I ask. I did hear however that there are most definitely armed 1811's within TSA, although there does not seem to be much rhyme or reason as to where they are located, how many there are, or how there duties vary from airport to airport however. And if they don't what's the process in/to becoming a TSA agent/one? Are you or is anyone/-body you know a TSA agent? Thank you so very much! And no (bad) stuff about me being schizophrenic please, it's hard enough being one without people making my life hell about it...

But when people specify illegals, they are speaking to those-- who just by "coinsedence" are of hispanic origin or descent..       ...hmm, I wonder why that is?      ..Yes, illegals aren't just made up of Mexican's...      however, according to the federal resources, roughly 92% of the illegals are of Mexican nationality.      So...ya, not all are Mexican's, but.. ya... 8% ???      Get real...      92% is a lot of Mexican Mo Fo's... What is that nearly 1/2 of Mexico?      Mexico is only 108 million strong. Since I'm gonna go with my statistics (having worked hand in hand with the government and their downsizing figures), that means there is really 60 mil. illegals.. 92% of 60 mil. is 54 mil.      That's that would conclude that literally 50% or 1/2 of the Mexican populace is currently in the country!      Which makes sense, if they are taking over.. Send 1/2, while the other stays here to protect the country...      What do you think?

If you are not open to everyone you are obviously doing something illegal.        All forms of transportation should have GPS tracking devices.   When you leave and enter a place you have to us your national ID to swipe in and out.      All this is to bring about safety, security and justice.

So I was at the library the other day and noticed a posting that the government could see what books you checked out. Then at the bank they said they keep records of all those who withdraw over $100/day. There are security cameras all over the cities. I understand that this is meant to protect us, but isn't it a little much?

20061230024041AAPSZU2	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Question for Law school students, or lawyers!!!!?	I know I want to be an attorney. I have worked with international human rights organization and became fascinated by the work that attorneys did there.   I've already applied to some schools. But in reading about classes and the bar exam, It scared me! Suddenly I'm feeling insecure and I just don't know if I am cut out for it. It sounds very challenging and frankly, a bit dry.   The LSAT was very difficult and I did not do well. I did however perform very well in college...high GPA. This is mostly because I have a good memory, and excellent writing skills. I like subjects in the social sciences.       I am afraid that if law school (and/or the bar exam and legal profession) is anything like the LSAT, I will fail miserably. Any advice?

Pra onde vai nosso dinheiro, aqueles reaizinhos que o banco come de nossa conta por qualquer motivo?   Entro numa fila e fico 1 ou 2 horas esperando. Isso é fogo.   Descaso com ostrabalhadores que perdem horas nas filas do banco.

20061109172456AAnlNHa	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	What Should I Do?	I don't know if this is typical but I believe my teacher has a pedophelliac tendencies. He's not harming anyone technically but he seems to have an unusual amount of affectionate (or discrete, shall we say) to unaware freshman girls. I've seen this repeatedly when I stay during lunch in his class, he usually sits with a girl, typically instructing her what to do and talking very softly. Today wasn't any special, I stayed after school and I witnessed him showing an abnormal display of affection on this girl who was correcting papers. He kept constantly joking around and laid his hand on her shoulder. I don't know if this is a legitimate reason to believe he's a pedophellic but he got kicked off from being the swim team's coach over a few ago and he's rumored to be a pervert.
