20090205174806AADmEqo	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Can my stubborn ears stretch to a larger gauge?	I just recently started stretching my ears. I was at a 14g and went to a 12g, but that didn't go well (I over-cleaned them, so they got flaky and they dried out).  So, I tried again a few weeks later, and everything went fine.  About a week after I put the 12g in, I decided to jump to a 10g.  These went in painfully!  They hurt the entire day, and the next morning.  The next day I took them out, only to find that my right one was bleeding; the left one was just sore.  So, I went back down to a 12g.  The day after that, i took the right one out because it was bothering me.... only to find some pus.  The right one also looks a little funny... could it be a blow-out?  What's the deal?  Should I let it heal and wait longer between stretchings, or are my ears "non-stretchable?"        I'm using surgical-grade stainless steel tapers, and apply Bio-oil daily.

When I was talking to her she crossed her arms a couple times in a way which made her boobs show more lol but when the teacher came over she did the same thing but in a way that kinda covered her boobs. She isn't a slut or anything so yeah... Was she trying to impress me or something?

It is on a stretchy band and the stretchy part has all peeled off, so the ring is limp and too loose to wear. However, the ring is extremely important to me and I want to get it fixed. Where should I go to get the stones put on a metal band and how much might it cost?

The cartilage piercing is fine (except my upper ear gets red sometimes and it hurts when I get hit or pressure is applied there... I had this done late august, so I think it hurts somewhat still because it's fairly new.)       However, on both ears, my lobe piercings ooze this clearish liquid (puss?). My lobe piercings don't hurt or anything, but this clearish liquid thing is gross and annoying and it's sometimes noticeable so it's embarrassing. Does anyone know how I can get rid of this???

Okay, since i was little, my mom always died/highlighted/color treated my hair, because she worked in a beauty salon.   So i found out that i have really damaged hair.   I wash my hair every other day, sometimes skip 2 or 3 days, to prevent this problem :    MY HAIR FALLS OUT!!   Every time i lather the shampoo out of my hair, i do it as gentle and easy as possible, and i comb it with my fingers lightly, but every time i comb it with my fingers, i lose like 3 hairs!   EVEN WHEN I CONDITION?!   I use this thing that makes my hair stronger and less damaged called 'HASK PLACENTA' which i spray in my hair after i get out of the shower, it's no-rinse and instant hair repair treatment that i got from a beauty store.    [Anyone use that? What were your results?]   I dont think this thing is working for my hair, and it would be very kind if you can suggest some good hair care products that will make my hair stronger and repair my hair.   [I will buy shampoo, conditioner, spray(recommended), mousse, anything that will help my hair]   Some stores that are in my town (San Francisco) are Walgreens, Sally's Beauty Sallon, etc, and some other that i dont know of    [Any recommendations of stores that sell hair products?]

When I finished my legs where all nice and smooth, but then the next day I could feel the hairs growing once more.   So I shaved again, and my legs got very very irritated.   Then I just left them alone, but then at night they keep poking me or it just feels like if I rub my legs hard enough I could start a fire.   I hate it!   Then I bought Nair. One: I dont know how to use Nair, I followed the instructions. Two: It BURNED! my legs where in hell, but I still kept the stuff on cause it said to keep it on for 5 min. And then when I wiped it didnt take out all the hair, it took out some but I still have that stubble feeling in my legs.      ARG! How do you guys do it!   What do you use? How do you keep your legs smooth and not so stubbly.   Or is it something you gotta get used to.

I'm 19 now, and I never get body pimples anymore...but I still get a few pimples on the lower part of my face from time to time....especially after eating dairy products...so I stopped doing that.      I secretly put on cover-stick (some kind of make-up) to cover up dead pimples and small ones until they are gone....but every here and there, I get one that isn't coverable.       I have to ask (to the girls) does one or two pimples really bother you?       A lot of my friends have it worse than me, and they find it strange that I get bothered by the occasional couple pimples...but it really makes me worry about myself. Should I just deal with it, and realize it doesn`t annoy women....

I want a roman numeral tattoo, but every time I draw XVII on my skin, it always looks like a prison tattoo or something, haha (no offense, it just looks way masculine and out-of-place on me!).      I have tried dressing it up with cursive font, etc., but I could never find anything I liked!      So I was doodling on my hand just barely and drew xvii, with the i's dotted with hearts.

I'm going to get it on the outside of my right wrist in navy blue, about 1" tall and 1.5" long.   (Side note: about how much will that cost, and how much should I tip for it?)      Cute idea? Yes?

20090205203825AACs63h	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	In order to be truly beautiful, you must be confident?	A very sweet boy asked me why I'm not confident and I said: "It's because I have no reason to be. I'm satisfied the way I am."      That's what I said. I always thought confidence meant obnoxious and loud people who are outspoken and opinionated.      I don't share my opinions unless asked and I see no point in raising my voice if no one cares to listen.      I find modesty much more beautiful than confidence. I'm much too insecure of myself to be confident. I guess that makes me shallow. :/       Hence, not beautiful. For instance, a not so attractive girl who tries by wearing perfectly arranged outfits and layers of makeup, has perfect hair, and struts with a smile is confident right? An attractive girl who doesn't try at all, no make up, normal clothing, slumps, chin down, pidgeon-toed, isn't beautiful because she's not confident?       She's just shy.

However now I've developed more curves  and a womanly shape, so  more fat goes to my butt, so I got a bit of a bubble booty going on!   I've noticed now when I sit down it feels a lot more cushioned and soft than it did before!    Have other women with rounder butts felt this!

20090205212110AAUf3YF	Beauty & Style;Makeup	How to safely remove eye makeup? I made a very painful mistake...?	Ok, so I have these face washing cloths that are good for removing makeup, right? Well the majority of the makeup I usually wear is eye makeup, and a little while ago I applied A LOT, including liquid eyeliner and both clear and colored mascara. Also a lot of eyeshadow. Anyway, I knew I needed to get it off before I went to bed, so since I didn't really want to use cold cream and I don't have any other makeup removers, I used the face washing cloth. Oh my GOD. It hurt like a *****! All it took was a few swipes to get it all off (that's the good news) but now the area just under my eyelids hurts SO FRIKKIN badly I can't stand it. When I look in the mirror I see that there's black makeup floating around the corners of my eyes. I've been able to get a little out, but not all of it, and that's my first problem. My second one is, how do I keep this from happening again? Is there a safe way to remove this stuff without getting it all up literally inside my lids? I'm sorry if this sounds stupid but I want the pain to stop now... It's slowly going away, after I've teared up for about 10 minutes now... Thanks for reading. Hope I get an answer I can use...

I was wondering what you think I should do because I have researched all of the methods and I would prefer not to use the lazor method or the electrolysis method.  I am thinking of using the depilatory cream or waxing.  I'd like to do it all in my house because I would be embarrassed to have to go out and reveal myself to the world.  Also, if possible, is there any way to remove hair and be gently killing the base of the hair so that slowly, bit by bit, the amount of hair that's growing will decrease???

All these people talk of natural beauty, yet when i enter competitions and such, people always comment on my moles or "beauty marks"  They stress this whole natural beauty crap, yet have no problem dismissing me because of them...  When i am at work or out, i am constantly asked why i don't model or get into acting... Why?  cause u need this perfect image to represent anything... I wish that growing up there was someone more natural lilke myself, as they still make me somewhat self-conscious... Cindy Crawford had one, which is apparantly the max... the way people make beauty out to be is sad... there are more beautiful people with "glitches" then there are with perfect skin... We need to make it happen, so kids like me don't get picked on all through school.... overweight, freckled, whatever, ,there's beauty everywhere....
