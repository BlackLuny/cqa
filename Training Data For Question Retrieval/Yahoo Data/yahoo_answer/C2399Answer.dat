Uy8ntukjaa	Go to the website for harvard school and look in the section on prospective students. All application information and requirements should be posted there. I'd say if you're a high school student, have a 4.0 GPA good SAT scores and a lot of extracurricular activities to make you a well rounded candidate. Also take as many AP classes as you can. You can also talk to Harvard admissions staff by phone or email if you need detailed assistance.

lzEuuseJaa	It doesn't state on their website. It only states that SSAT scores average 93 percentile, which must be the combined score. It is likely similar for the ISEE, although combined SSAT scores are a higher percentile than their true average. I've seen SSAT scores with a true average of 82 that are 88 percentile combined. ISEE does not give a combined score, but 4 separate percentiles, along with the stanines. So maybe ISEE scores can be a bit lower.     If you didn't get your ISEE scores yet, by mail it took us exactly a week from the date my son took them and we're across the country from ERB.    From the kids I've spoken to it was evenly split on which test was harder, maybe a little more ISEE. My son didn't take the SSAT so I don't know for sure. He's good at breaking the tests down. I've never seen a true direct score comparison between the SSAT and ISEE.    The best thing to do is to call and ask them. They might be more likely to tell you over the phone, rather than email something in writing. Mention that the info is on their website for the SSAT, so you'd like to know for the ISEE.    http://www.andover.edu/Admission/Pages/F...    Good luck!

KEvBMlvaaa	no. you only send in your transcript from grades 9-11. and then you tell them the weight of your other classes (like AP, honors, regular, etc) and they consider those. then if you get accepted you send them the final transcript at the end of the year. they dont care about the 1st semester of senior year until the end of the year if you are accepted.|`|oLI2SJ08aa	It depends. If the colleges ask for a mid year report/most current grades, then yes you will have to send them. If not, then don't worry about it. If you're unsure, contact each college and ask if they need your Fall 2008 grades.|`|Uy8ntukjaa	You should not resend your transcripts unless the college you've applied to requests it. They will likely want a complete high school transcript after you've graduated so there isn't any point in sending another one now.

I was in the second group of people to take that test back in the 80's.  Some people think the test is a no brain-er.  Other folks that I've known couldn't pass it.    It comes down to how well you think you can write, how good you are in your math skills and how good you are in reading.  There are test prep books sold for preparing to take the test.  I've heard there are classes that you can take to prepare for the test.  It depends on where you live, too.  Some universities have prep classes for taking the CBEST.    Good luck.  I passed it on my first try before they had a practice book.  Others couldn't pass it.  Do a Google on CBEST test booklets. Your library may have one to check out.  Good luck!

6DmsiLGbaa	Yes.  To be honest, the BYU people don't really look to see WHAT classes you take so much as how well you do in them.  Your GPA is key, as is your ACT or SAT test scores.  You need to have at least a 26 in the ACT or equivalent in the SAT (I can't remember the minimum acceptable score, but you can always look online for that).      Of lesser importance, they will also look at your seminary attendance and your recommendation from your bishop.  They will check if you've joined any extra curricular activities, what offices you held in said activities, and whether or not you did any community service (and you can count anything you did as part of your youth group or Young Women's or Young Men's).      If your test scores are high enough, you should be okay.  If you're still worried, though, go do some volunteer work.  Find a homeless shelter or a hospital or even a library and give some time.  They eat that sort of stuff up.|`|77b2610047fd4e5f740d75e96c9a88a2aa	Yup.  You'll want a great recommendation and you'll want to write fantastic essays.  You'll also need really good test scores.  I would recommend having at least a 28 on your ACT.  If you have to take it more than once, so be it.|`|dc00e6f724cc094e75dc0475843d0e44aa	You do not need to have taken AP classes to get into BYU.  With that good of a GPA, you should be fine.   You will need a recommendation from an LDS bishop as part of your application process.|`|Uy8ntukjaa	You don't need AP classes to get into a University. AP classes just mean you don't have to take those same GE core classes again when you get to college (if you pass the AP exams of course).
f61c6ad75081d1de726d4e9737429211aa	You asked 'How to write an essay?'...    Step one:  Research those who definitely are involved in the Information Age...Y!A participants...maybe or maybe not.  Step Two:  Form your own opinion after consulting 'good' research sources.  Sept Three:  Write  Introduction:  Ask an interesting and pertinent question.  Then give your personal belief statement in a single thesis sentence.  Body:  Have at least 3 points and support them with evidence.  Be sure to round it out by presenting and refuting the opposite opinion from yours as an important part of your written content.  Conclusion:  No new info...write 1 summary sentence for each body paragraph.    I hope this provides some helpful guidelines for you.  The best way to learn to do it is by doing it.  Good luck    Some research information is available below, but if you want a good grade...use the public library.  Add book sources and magazine articles.  On this subject, you will find many.    Personal opinion...It has cultivated a strong interest in continued education in me and desire to follow recent research.

I am also assuming that your return will be less than $1,000 dollars, so avoid places like H&R Block because of the high costs. Plus, since you are being claimed as a dependent you won't be able to make tuition or numerous other deductions. (I know it sucks I am going through the same thing)    If you simply want to get the money that you overpaid for taxes, get your W-2, go to www.taxcut.com and fill in the information as accurately as you can.    I'd advise you use Direct Deposit, because the money will be in your account in around 7 days.    Good luck man!

Nn8V7Akiaa	for 5 para graph essays brainstorming is probably the BEST thing you can do. (for 3 or 4 paragraphs just drop a topic paragraph)  first make a skeleton outline  1. Intro  2. Topic Para  3. "  4. "  5. Conclusion    Then fill in the blacks. Figure out what your 3 topics might be and add them to the outline. then figure out info and details to support then and add them to the outline. You should then start writing    For the intro make sure to include a little background, a thesis statement (if you need one), and your three main ideas (don't explain them yet, just list em). A Good intro is KEY to the rest of the paper as it is almost an outline itself    for the topic sentences restate the topic and fill the rest up with support (the topic sentences aren't nearly as important as the intro but are needed to back up the main ideas ESPECIALLY in a thesis paper)    Finally for the conclusion, which is usually short (only 2-3 sentences) state something about how the points prove your main idea, and then a possible impact of the idea, or something like that...    GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR WRITING!!

Columbia is one of those universities that love to judge a student based on their writing....|`|IGSVfbGuaa	Your SAT scores are so so. GET THEM UP.  GPA is solid.  Class rank is good.  Regardless if your school offered AP or not, the deans will see this and think you don't like to challange yourself. IB/AP rank above any other class type, but you are in an honors program which is good, so you don't be "killed off" by this catagory. Also your rank in this is good.    Any of your "one semester" extra cirriculars, just throw those away. Colleges will see those and think you did them only for colleges, not by choice/interest, which may or may not be true. The ones which you've been in for at least 1 year, with a leadership position, will be the one to sell yourself on. The online course is academic. And how long were you in the newspaper? If it's at least one year, that would be good. Also, the 28 hours volunteering part will not help you much. if you want a volunteer service to be really noticed, you need at least 100 hours at one place.    Your awards are ok. Nothing too amazing, not to shatter your feelings, but it's true.    Your personal-part is interesting. To start, I'm sorry to say New York, and the east coast in general, is one of the most competitive states/regions in the US, you will have ALOT of competition, because colleges like a diverse student population of states, countries, and ethnicities. Which brings me to point 2, you being asian, I'm sorry to say doesn't help either. You may be a minority in the US, but not in colleges, but an asian does stand out better than a white person, as racist as that sounds. Not sure how the income will effect you.    COlumbia judges you alot on your writing, so you better hope they love your essay. And I hope your letters of reccomendation were great too. If it's from a teacher, coach, or someone else you've known for a long time, that will mean more than anything.    So, can you get in? Who knows, only the current dean of Admissions. Just remember, thousands of perfect applicants, with perfect grades in the highest courses possible, get turned down every year. SO good luck to you.

4d8g3q6saa	1)social changes: To speak about SOCIAL changes is only   possible when thenumber of automobiles produced has   reached a certain amount, when the car has become a vehicle  for everyone.That's why Henry FORD's construction of his   famous model T was just the model for the manyfold purposes  of farmers,workers, traders,small shopowners,salesmen.   .So I think it was revolution because by increasing the car  production the other big means of transport (the train) had   been severely affected,at least in many parts of the country.  People calculated,and often if turned out to be cheaper   (think of the enormously cheap gas price at the twenties and  early thirties),cheaper than using the railroad.Roads  had been  traffic routes  1 , and the face of of cities changed after   motorization.  2)Photos:I recommend you an address:www.allposters.com,  an e-card and poster address,but you will you just need to type  into the search mask and at the moment you'll get lots  of car types the first of which were not typical for a SOCIAL change,and but then you'll find the typical Ford Tin Lizzy in   different variants, for tradesmen,workers and farmers.

735KiHn2aa	I am a former Spanish teacher and whenever I taught food/drink vocab. we always played several review games. I would get several different grocery store ads (they usually have them at the front of the store) and pass one out to each child. I divided the class into teams of 3 or 4 students. Then I would say "necesito una foto de _____". The teams each had 1 team leader who was responsible for bringing the ad up to me and pointing to the correct picture. Another game we would do is get 2 different colored fly swatters- you can get them a the dollar store, Walmart, etc... Then I would write the vocab. words on the board or you can write them on chart paper. But you need to write them all scattered around- not in a row. The class is then divided into 2 teams. 1 player from each team comes up and you call a word out in English. They have to find the word in Spanish and smack it with the swatter. The team with the most points wins! The last idea I have is a little project. I would have the children make restaurant menus. They would have to come up with a Spanish name for their restaurant and include specific items that I would tell them to have. You can come up with a rubric to grade these. I hope these ideas helped a bit.

Make small groups (no more than 4 kids). Then, let them eat !<br>  They can also write sentences with the names of the food...Simple sentences like: Me gusta el arroz, no me gusta la pasta..|`|Ds4xCthSaa	Idea 1) If you are really daring you can take them outside and let them play a game of steal the bacon. Assign students different food names. When you call that food name (in spanish) the students that were assigned that name have to run and grab whatever is in the middle. We just used a simple blackboard eraser.<br>  <br>  Idea 2) You can also do something similar to that and play fruit basket upset. This is alot like steal the bacon, but it has to do with chairs in a circle. When you call the food, kids with that food assigned to them get up and change spots. When you call fruit basket turnover or whatever you want to say,.. they call get up and move.<br>  <br>  Idea 3) You could play a game sort of like where two students are up at the board facing the class. Class is divided into teams. Behind each student up at the board is a spanish word that you have gone over. Students have to try to give clues to the person from their team up at the board so they can guess what word it is. For instance if it was tortilla, they would tell them... flat, corn, flour, white. To make it real interesting tell them they have to give the clues in spanish.<br>  <br>  Idea 4) bring lots of spanish foods in, and go over all of them and then splurge and eat them all.
3e0fb112d935519e50f071750d581bcdaa	Girl Code <br>  The code of guidelines that are girls most obey in order not to get kicked out of the community. <br>  There are many opinions if the Girl Code actually exists, as well as the Guy Code.<br>  1) If you change boyfriends so fast they rarely achieve name status, a man must be around for at least six weeks before you make your friends bother to learn his first name. Until such time, he should be referred to as "The boy" or "That guy". <br>  <br>  2) All girls must have a "Mr.Right Now". This is the guy friend who is always ready and available to hang out with you, and may or may not like you as more than a friend. He is always ready to party till dawn, and do things you wish you didn't remember in the morning. He's not “Mr. Right,” but he may be good enough to be “Mr. Right Now.” <br>  <br>  3) If you just met a guy and know absolutley nothing about him, but need to refer to him during 'girl talk' you use one example of who he is, something he has, or what he does, and he becomes... that guy. <br>  (Ex. "The Camaro guy", "The Trainer dude", "The Four a.m. in the Taxi Guy") <br>  <br>  4) Every girl must wait at least a day and a half before calling a guy whose number she has retreived. <br>  <br>  5) You are never in any case to date a friends ex or a guy who she was really into. <br>  Exception: If he's one of those guys who every girl likes. <br>  <br>  6) You are to never diss a friends boyfriend except to agree lightly or nod when she says he's being a asshole. In most cases it is easier to nod. <br>  Exception: If a guy cheated or dumped your friend is is exceptional for you to claim he isn't good enough, and that she deserves better as well as reminding her that he was an asshole anyway. <br>  <br>  7) If you wan't to date a friend brother it is required that you get said friends permission. <br>  <br>  8) No girl is to ever hang out with the boyfriend of a friend without the friend present. If permission to is granted their should be at least 3 other people with you. <br>  <br>  9) No girl may have more than one 'Love of her Life' at one time, though having a boyfriend and a 'Love of her Life' is fine. <br>  <br>  10) No girl shall wear the same outfit or perfume as a friend is they will knowingly be in the same place. <br>  <br>  11) No girl shall purchase a distinctive item of clothing which she is aware her friend owns without express permission from the friend. <br>  <br>  12) No girl shall borrow an item of clothing without asking the clothing owner's permission, unless both parties have made an official decision to waive this rule in the context of their friendship. <br>  <br>  13) An eye for an eye and a foot for a foot. If a friend borrows an item of clothing and destroys it, said friend must re-pay it. <br>  <br>  14) The penalty for exposing a secret to an unauthorized party shall be exile from Girlville. <br>  <br>  15) A girl who can substantially claim that she was not aware that a piece of information was a secret at the time she exposed it shall not be subject to punishment. <br>  <br>  16) Inside jokes are not to be explained to outsiders. <br>  <br>  17) Always leave a man wanting more but don't leave him guessing too long since guys do not take hints easily. <br>  <br>  18) If a guy your friend is into asks for your number, you are to deny it and walk away, and/or slip him your friends number while saying, "I think she is more your type, you should call her". <br>  <br>  19) Chicks before Dicks. Simple. <br>  <br>  20) In a case where a friend spreads a horrible rumor about a friend, and than apologizes they are to be given the cold-shoulder for at least 3 days. <br>  <br>  21) In a fight between a friend and her boyfriend you must always choose your friends side. <br>  <br>  22) When dating a girl should find equal and/or enough time to still hang out with her girls. <br>  <br>  23) Never insult your friend but never let your friend leave the house looking hideous. Find a better way to tell your friend how they look. <br>  Ex: 'I think your other jeans are nice', 'You should wear less eyeliner, you have great eyes'. <br>  <br>  24) When a friend is drunk, never allow her to dial, drive or leave with a random guy. <br>  <br>  25) When a friend calls you up complaining about how she is drunk and can't go home you must allow her to stay at your house, without letting your parentals (if you live with them) find out. <br>  <br>  26) When out with the ladies, if Girl #1 points out a guy that she is interested in, Girl #2 should avoid making a bee-line over to him to get his number for herself. Show some respect. <br>  <br>  27) When said evening is described as a "Girls’ Night Out" that means it is for GIRLS ONLY. Consider it payback for all those tree houses and snow forts we couldn’t enter as children. Do not invite your boyfriend. <br>  <br>  28) Stop being the "Me too!" girl If your friend is telling a story, stop stealing her thunder – and her story – by constantly trying to one-up her. For example: <br>  GIRL 1: I had a horrible day. My flat iron broke in the middle of straightening, I dropped my brand new bottle of Burberry Touch on the bathroom floor, I missed the bus by two seconds and was late for school, m|`|cbRFGbIoaa	Um.............shop till you drop and always only get a cute guy!|`|xVwCGfQ0aa	Should live by?<br>  <br>  1)Don't date your best friends ex. Ever. Even if she says its ok.<br>  <br>  2)Don't say yes on the first, second and possibly third date as they won't respect you in the morning (you aren't "wife"material if you're easy) Get to know them as a friend, first and foremost.<br>  <br>  3) Men will say and do anything, tell the most outrageous lies and make fantastical promises to get you in the sack, don't get suckered!<br>  <br>  4) Use protection, every time.|`|KeDIU7pkaa	Not everyone lives by codes. However, there is a boy code and girl code.<br>  <br>       For instance, in dating/ flirting: a girl starts brushing her arm against a boy, which in "girl language" means put your arm around me. The list is endless on both sides, so that is how far I go.|`|7VwdSHd8aa	depends people are different. dont date friends/relatives ex's, dont take other peoples men. general respect as far as im concerned.|`|rCUUuXXgaa	well girl code is jus in a girls head really its jus there lol, u probebly do it everyday without realising x

Also, if the guy ejaculates near, and the semen drips down and near the woman's vagina, there's a slight risk of pregnancy as well.<br>  And yes, it is for pleasure. Anal sex is a different feeling for the guy than vaginal sex. For the women, however, only some prefer it.

PPR0ngFPaa	school degree for hMPt and CCr|`|W1tx1p2iaa	It does not benifit you from becoming a PTA first.  I work with a PTA who is getting her DPT.  She started as an 17 year old in a PTA program and decided to become a DPT while in the progra.  She finished her 2 years become a PTA.  Then stayed at the CC for 1 more year to take some pre req.  For her 4 th year she is at a local school PT school with a 3 plus 3 program.  She is taking the pre reqs not offered at the CC plus finishing her BS.  She will be in the DPT program in the fall.  Since it was a 3 plus 3 program, it will take her 7 years not 6.  She only got out of 3 1-2 credit classes that are seminars in the 3+3 program during the first 3 years of program.  (work includes med terminology, patient education, and gait training/transfer training).<br>  <br>  It has worked for her and she works 10 hours a week as a PTA but I would not necessarily recommend this format esp if you do not start right as a freshman. <br>  <br>  <br>  To become a pediatric PT--<br>  <br>  Go to a PT program- you will get a generalist degree just as in med school.  You learn all of the specialties-ortho, neuro, integument and cardiopulmonary.  If you are interested in peds, you will definately take a pediatric clinical and maybe take a graduate elective if available.  Your research project would have a peds focus.  When you graduate you would get a pediatric job and hopefully find a pediatric mentor.  If interested once you graduate, you may choose a residency or fellowship in peds.  You may also choose to sit for the PCS (Board certification in peds) exam.<br>  <br>  Best wishes|`|Moz2d806aa	You would get the same DPT as any physical therapist. While I think officially you can apply to PT school with only an associates, it is very hard to get in, so you really need a bachelor's unless you have like 10 years of experience as a PTA.

AA10407542	I would use a realtor, and they are kind of hungry right now. Your specific need might not ever be found using Google or other searches in that a land owner will not list "Daycare ready for move in"  They want to keep this general to rent or sell it faster.  Your best option is to use the services with a realtor hand down.  What age you will care for and the number of these children will all be determined by the physical environment and the applicable licensing.  San Jose is HUGE so you should have a large set of listings for this.  One thing off the bat to look at would be the number of bathrooms.  These are expensive to add/remodel and are on the top of the list for licensing.  You should contact  ( child protective services) for a description of what the physical environment must have to be licensed.  This will help the agent narrow your search.  NAEYC also has some great suggestions regarding this.  Write me back if you have questions, I use to be a director in Santa Barbara Ca.

You can then speculate, based on the evidence, as to what implications there perhaps are for the interpretation of homosexuality in humans.  See <a href="http://www.bidstrup.com/sodomy.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bidstrup.com/sodomy.htm</a><br>  <br>  Otherwise, you can find other topic ideas at the following sites:<br>  <a href="http://www.tcc.edu/students/resources/writcent/HANDOUTS/writing/restopics.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.tcc.edu/students/resources/wr...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.uwc.ucf.edu/Writing%20Resources/Handouts/research_topics.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.uwc.ucf.edu/Writing%20Resourc...</a><br>  <a href="http://lib1.bmcc.cuny.edu/help/speech/speechtopics.html" rel="nofollow">http://lib1.bmcc.cuny.edu/help/speech/sp...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck to you, whatever you decide.|`|DcCECelaaa	First Suggestion:  Edit your question to add a couple of details, namely, what class or field of study this is for, and what level or grade would this be.<br>  <br>  Without the above information, I can only guess that you may find homosexuality and/or genetics to "interesting" based on your first attempt to research  a topic.  Along the same lines has been the search for the gene (if it exists) that predisposes some people to become alcoholics over non-alcoholics.  I don't think they've found that gene either but like homosexuality, if they ever did, that might suggest a treatment for alcoholism (the "magic pill") or even genetic screening before invitro-fertilization that might lead to greater control over whether the child was hetero or homosexual, or a non-alcoholic vs. alcoholic.<br>  <br>  At present, they do know how to screen male sperm which determines the gender of the baby.  Therefore people can have greater control over whether they get a male or female BEFORE the ovum is invitro-fertilized, and that may have many social and governmental implications for populating our society if this screening become commonplace.  That could be one topic, pregnant with possibilities (excuse the pun!)<br>  <br>  Another topic along  the lines of biology or science would be this year's latest flu vaccine.  The flu virus is always mutating such that they have to come up with a new vaccine each year before they mass produce vaccines prior to flu season.  However this past year, they found a genetic or other factor that most flu viruses have in common which led to a universal flu vaccine that was superior to strains produced in the past.  If genetics and biology is your class or interest, that might make for a good paper.|`|ChuhyvEaaa	As with most interesting topics, there is going to be some level of controversy associated with them which means that there is no clear-cut definitive answer.

9r1zw0evaa	Reconstruction is the era in the U.S. history from 1865 to 1877, when the U.S. focused on abolishing slavery, destroying all traces of the Confederacy, establishing the rights of Freedmen, the name used for freed slaves, and through three new constitutional amendments strengthening the role of the federal governments and its courts. Reconstruction policies were debated in the North as soon as the war started, and began in earnest after the Emancipation Proclamation, issued on January 1, 1863, and the federal occupation of major parts of southern states allowed the formation of new, loyal state governments. President Abraham Lincoln was the major policymaker until his death in April, 1865. Reconstruction began in each state as soon as federal troops controlled most of the state. It ended at different times in different states. The Compromise of 1877 saw the collapse of the last three Republican state governments in the South, so 1877 is the usual date given for the end of Reconstruction, although some historians extend the era to the 1890s.[1] The bitterness and repercussions from the heated conflicts of the era lasted well into the 20th century. "Reconstruction" is also the term used in textbooks for the history of the entire U.S. 1865-1877.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	The period immediately following the Civil War, 1865 to about 1877, when the South was being rebuilt?

I did two semesters first and then I did the program.  I absolutely loved the experience.  As soon as a i graduate i a applying to do it again.  If you are a good swimmer i would recommend being a lifeguard. I was a guard at blizzard beach and its absolutely the best job as a CPer.  Any job though is worth it, but lifeguards have a bit more leeway and the managers are awesome.  But start school and then apply.

They have so many students and why do they hate you?    Do they have some personal gain by hating you?    What situation has led you to believe that they hate you?    Are you a good student?    What are your grades like?    Do you do homework?    Are you respectful to your teachers?|`|bIouq64Oaa	You're quiet, sure, but do you pay attention in their class? Do you get your work done? Do you keep your grades up? When you do speak, do you use a disrespectful tone? Do you correct them when they make mistakes?    Also, you could just be imagining that they are showing a specific dislike toward you. I mean, most middle school and high school teachers have between 80 - 150 students that they see every day, an you're one of those. Could it be that they simply don't have enough time to take out of their busy day to make you feel like they don't hate you?|`|K8R4fCsZaa	well it is probably for a reason that is universal since they all hate you    so do you look a way that would induce hate from a large group  are you saying they hate you cause they give you bad grades!?  (you may just be slow in that regard and they may not hate you)    i personally don't like the whiny crap i hear a lot form my own friends about how everything is someone else doing and your close to sounding like that, I'm sure it is something you are doing to cause this you are not so special that the world needs to hold you down you are most likely sabotaging yourself in some way and the sooner you realize it and change the sooner you can start to have a meaningful life    sorry to be harsh, but well i feel i need to be  and i am not really sorry     hope that helps|`|kcbVPJh9aa	I don't think they harte you. You are probably their favorite. If you're as quiet as you say you are. Most teachers, when you act really good and don't bother them as much as other really petty students. They will look your way and give off a really mad look but just kinda shrug and act like you understand.  But if you still think  they hate you try to get to know them better .               Hope it helps                             J.M.|`|I5Hm8CYVaa	In order to really not like a student they have to be a real a--hole. There have only been 2 or 3 in five years that I never want to see again. I don't like students who are disrespectful to me, their peers or to the space and supplies. I try to reach them, but sometimes you just don't care what their deal is and you just wish they would go away. I definitely wouldn't dislike a kid because they were quiet. In fact, sometimes those kids are the best. I think that if all of your teachers hate you that it might be you misreading them. If you are really just quiet and withdrawn it may just be awkward for them, not an expression of disdain. You might be a little overly sensitive and are not interpreting this accurately. Do you think other people hate you or just your teachers? It might also be worth a look at yourself, why would they hate you? I don't know you, so I can't be sure if you're paranoid, the victim of a strange conspiracy or possibly a pain in the rear and you just don't know it. Try to do a little introspection, ask your friends if they agree with you, otherwise who cares what they think anyway? Ha, ha. Really. If someone doesn't like you and you haven't done anything to them, screw em. I don't care if they are a teacher, and I am one. It's Saturday night, you should be watching tv or something. Peace.|`|nl7tkxc3aa	Maybe ..    you give off a bad vibe ?|`|eeHrcxjEaa	From most likely to least likely:    1) They didn't hate you until your teenage "everybody hates me" hormones got in the way.  Now that you're acting like everybody hates you and you hate them, they feel hated, and therefore don't like you.  2) Sometimes not asking questions or not participating in class can be a sign of simply not caring.  Teachers don't like it when you don't care about their class.  3) Maybe you don't try to do your best in their classes, on homework, tests, etc.- teachers can tell when you don't like their class.  4) Maybe your style of clothing, or your overall general attitude, gives off a negative impression about you.   5) Maybe they're all racist.  6) Maybe they're all sexist.  7) Maybe they all had visions at the beginning of the year, where all their great-grandparents told them to avoid you at all costs.|`|uKpi4I5Oaa	I'm quiet too!

I'm a substitute teacher and I don't even hate the ones who give me a hard time!  I especially don't think a teacher would hate a quiet student.  They might just not pay much attention to you because you're less demanding than the other students who voice themselves more often.  Try approaching your teachers.  Maybe pick one who seems easy to talk to and see where that gets you.  I'd like to think that my students would talk to me if they have any problems.  I don't ever want a student to think I hate him/her.|`|wuuJWjtDaa	i doubt they hate you, they probably just hate their job.|`|Oextrh4iaa	Why do you assume they hate you?|`|Xb7tLeTpaa	you pick on them alot you give them to much homework
oLI2SJ08aa	When you find out the answer, tell me. What bothers me is that teachers will make you buy a $400 textbook, then only use half of it! Or the book comes with an online code and then you never use that code. As someone at my school pointed out, part of the problem is that the consumer (the students) and the supplier (the professors) are not the same people. They don't really realize how much the books cost or even what is sold with the books.|`|V3HVvdyvaa	try buying used books they are so much cheaper and they can be returned for credit for your next semester books...  you can pick them up at the campus bookstore right next to the new books|`|7xCF5tdgaa	I guess because Collage is the hardest part of school in your in entire life. good luck!|`|5110a754f0890492a3b2aff5b1ac5578aa	The correct English is "Why are those college books so expensive?"    And it is not the paper, it is the effort and labor of the author or editor that is costing so much.  It can take an author about 2 years to get a book from writing it, to selling it on the bookshelf.

I decided that backpacks weren't the thing for a university girl and ditched the back pack and went for a book bag.     Just one thing and I am not sure how your new school will be but make sure you get a locker or have a locker that you're sharing with otherwise those books can be a pain to carry and tote around. My old high school was so picky about giving out lockers it wasn't even funny.  I couldn't even get a locker. So I ended up with one of those backpacks with wheels so I ended up wheeling my books around, much easier than wearing those books on your back and those books are heavy.|`|JFL7HKhSaa	lots of girls are into the Betseyville line by betsey johnson on the pretty expensive side but any cute bag that will hold school supplies is cute.|`|4KocdJt4aa	Your over thinking this a lot.

1AazeCmYaa	Here are some great tips on how to consolidate student loans.One good thing about government loans is that the interest rates are fixed when consolidating them, and so rest assured that the rates that the lending company will charge you are within the boundaries of the law. Albeit there is already a ceiling on the interest rates when consolidating government loans, it is always to your advantage if you will shop around for those with really low interest rates.    http://www.worldbestloans.com/student-lo...    Grace period of loan repayment means you are done with college and earn a degree but the part of repayment, you just have not started. The grace period is usually from the graduation day to 6 months after and is usually regarded as an excellent time to which you acquire college student loan consolidation.|`|yGOmMQP7aa	Most companies stopped doing consolidation loans right about the time your hubby applied.

XBJVU0Gtaa	There are a few boarding schools with access to NYC.  You can also consider boarding schools in CT and NJ.      Take a look at the Masters School which is a 30min. train ride to the heart of Manhattan. Look at Millbrook School which also has train access, but further away. I think Choate is not too far from the New Haven train line. Lawrenceville and the Hun School of Princeton are close to the Princeton train to NYC. Blair Academy has a weekend shuttle to a NYC bus. If you are a boy, Trinity Pawling is close to the Pawling train to NYC. I am guessing that the Stony Brook School in Long Island has access to a train as well.      If you want to apply for next year, you are late.  The application deadline for most schools is 1/10 - 2/1.  Many schools will accept late applications, but if you need financial aid, it is hard to get when you are late.  You should also register for the SSAT now.

No strip searches in school, no bars, you can leave school any time you want.       Truancy laws are designed to actually be in your best interests.  As a minor, you really have no clue as to how the world works.        Your constitutional rights are not taken away by school.  Your parents and government officials act in your best interests until you are old enough to make informed and considered decisions.       Go with the flow for now, enjoy being who you are at the age you are. Time goes by fast enough, soon you will realize schoolis a good thing.|`|5jINw4PGaa	I don't know what jail is like. But I love my school.|`|NTGuR64Raa	no i've never been to jail, can't compare.|`|DvFtOGWbaa	Yes i agree with you LOL|`|WrmeB8zEaa	My school forces random kids at lunch to clean all the tables and mop the floor while everyone else is at recess (even if they did nothing wrong!!)

The thing you need to do is go make friends  and become a strong unit. Friends bring out the  best in the highschool experience. You seem like  a down to earth awesome girl so I'm sure that you will  love it.    Good luck beautiful|`|D58bzW4Jaa	Im a sophomore.    High school is starting to get really boring. I cant wait till I graduate.|`|IIpEaDCcaa	Just like middle school...    Highschool is a superficial hell.    If I ever have kids, I'll be sure to have them homeschooled.|`|iuB1BRj5aa	I live in Washington state!!     Honestly, high school is so much fun. I'm a junior, and I love it. People are so nice, it's easy to make friends, and you gain and earn so much. You learn many things, and you really find who you are.     You'll love high school.|`|vvj7IY9Gaa	if you dont compare your self to the popular kids and be your self and stay in your crowd high skoo will be really fun|`|IE9NfLGoaa	high school's hell on earth|`|DKPep30Naa	At 1st its cool then it gets gay like any other school then to the end of your high school career it gets good, you get off earlier and if you lucky you can graduate early.|`|wmfJJLiDaa	well, if you're moving, its time to escape the "nerdy" sterotype and try to be yourself. high school is amazing! you shouldn't care what ppl will think about you because they'res so many cliques that you're sure to find a group of nice girls who will like you for who you really are.|`|4RLjQ4M4aa	It's not as big a deal as everyone says it is. the homeworks barely harder...  school only really starts to get hard in the 2nd semester of freshman year. just pray you don't get fished. that doesnt happen too often though.|`|HvQvRVnJaa	Its all about awkwardness and trying to identify yourself. Hint: Those who are the "ghetto" or "Popular" kids now always seem to end up the losers when they become grown up. Well, I shouldnt generalize but my point is, always remember you are no better or worse than anyone else, I was particularly a target of harassment and very unpopular for the first 3 years of high school.... always made out to be a loser... but Guess what? I am now self employed, successful, and many of the folks who tormented me STILL work at taco bell and theyre 25 years old.|`|MbofFgD0aa	at my high school, its SO  much fun. pretty much everyone gets along and there's tons more freedom than there was in middle school. i love going to school and the teachers are mostly very funny and very nice.|`|KIX3Hfakaa	okay kid. so highschool is sort of like in the movies, but at the same time its completely different.  Since you are moving to a new school, you can be whoever you want to be. make an impression that will last. Dont be nervous, and remember, this is new for everyone in your grade as well.   Do you play any sports? this is a great way to meet new people and be involved in school.   Idk if ur school will have any probs will drugs, but just dont mess with that stuff or those people.   Highschool can be a lot of fun. You can make friends that will have ur back forever. you'll go to parties and have lots of fun-just dont drink, pls.  Just dont worry, its going to be great.|`|1vFrenKoaa	High school's just like middle school.  It's nothing like they make it seem on tv, you won't get beat on your first day or anything. Upperclassmen aren't out to get freshmen.  As long as you have a couple of friends or people you know you'll be fine.   If you get lost just make sure to walk with confidence like you know where you're going. You don't want to look helpless or someone may try to pick on you. But if you are lost ask the nearest falculty member NOT a student there is always the chance someone would give you wrong directions.   So basically just be confidence and find someone friends to talk to and you'll be fine.|`|UJYICsk1aa	THE BEST TIME OF YOUR LIFE.|`|3j0reWJXaa	Highschool Sucks.

Be yourself and join activities in high school that your interested in in order to make high school fun.|`|AA12351099	Kids can be mean in high school if you don't exactly fit in... now im not saying that you don't, what i am trying to get at is that high school is what YOU decide to make of it. In the end you are in control of the majority of what happens to you, who you make friends with, etc.    So just aim high and try and be friends with everyone, because i dont know about you but i hate the feeling of people not liking me.|`|b9fd917c446e0d2b1c604b0ed7e053c6aa	a huge experience, starting of with drama freshmen year and immature boys, softrmore year you are trying to figure out who you are and junior year you pretty much are content, know who you are and everyone is grown up, junior year is the best and , so i have heard senior year you just want to get the heck out|`|tsCXQhMmaa	It really is a great experience. Everyone gets the jitters about it and people react to it differently but embrace it because its over too quickly.

Think about it- it's just a bunch of kids your age, just like it's always been.  It can be fun!   Get involved in activities you like- drama, yearbook, school newspaper or whatever and get some good friends who like doing the same things as you.  I bet you'll have lots of fun!|`|pnQRTDU4aa	It really depends what you make of it. If you like to have fun and are outgoing then it will be some of the best years of your life. Have a positive attitude and try not to get down about things that are out of your control. Being nerdy is never a bad thing. Good grades allow you to have more options for your future and a better life in the end. Try to get involved with as many school activities and sports as possible. It will allow you to meet more people and stay in good shape.|`|asIhe7BNaa	Wellllll...... The North West is interesting. You might be liked, you might not. Do you shop at Abercrombie and American Eagle? Are you waaaaaaaaay into American Idol? Then you will probably have friends.|`|c5c157de44722b3201c46ab6e2a00078aa	actually, high school is what you make it. i personally think it sux BIG time bc people are still in the state where they believe they are better than you and their minds haven't left that yet. actually they don't come to full realization until probably like sophmore college year or even junior bc then they wake up and smell the roses. they see life is tough and there are people that actually don't spend all their time with their turned up noses thinking they're better. in the end, they're just all people. and these kids realize that they're just other people. not any better (as they thought) anymore. don't change for the worse. stay good and true and breeze through it. one thing we can all agree with probably is that it goes by fast.|`|iMrKo8cSaa	FREAKING.

BC97yskSaa	The question seems to be, do farmers (and people who pitch hay) use "fork" as a verb?     Yes, "Fork" IS used as a verb. Maybe not be you and me - but it IS.    I looked this up in TheFreeDictionary.com and I got the following.    fork  (f?rk)  n.  1. A utensil with two or more prongs, used for eating or serving food.  2. An implement with two or more prongs used for raising, carrying, piercing, or digging.  3.  a. A bifurcation or separation into two or more branches or parts.  b. The point at which such a bifurcation or separation occurs: a fork in a road.  c. One of the branches of such a bifurcation or separation: the right fork. See Synonyms at branch.  4. Games An attack by one chess piece on two pieces at the same time.  v. forked, forking, forks  v.tr.  1. To raise, carry, pitch, or pierce with a fork.  2. To give the shape of a fork to (one's fingers, for example).  3. Games To launch an attack on (two chess pieces).  4. Informal To pay. Used with over, out, or up: forked over $80 for front-row seats; forked up the money owed.  v.intr.  1. To divide into two or more branches: The river forks here.  2.  a. To use a fork, as in working.  b. To turn at or travel along a fork.  [Middle English forke, digging fork, from Old English forca and from Old North French forque, both from Latin furca.]  forker n.  forkful n.    The American Heritage? Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition copyright ?2000 by Houghton Mifflin Company. Updated in 2003. Published by Houghton Mifflin Company. All rights reserved.  fork  Noun  1. a small tool with long thin prongs on the end of a handle, used for lifting food to the mouth  2. a larger similar-shaped gardening tool, used for lifting or digging  3. forks the part of a bicycle that links the handlebars to the front wheel  4.  a. (of a road, river, etc.) a division into two or more branches  b. the point where the division begins  c. such a branch  Verb  1. to pick up, dig, etc., with a fork  2. to be divided into two or more branches  3. to take one or other branch at a fork in a road, etc. [Latin furca]    Collins Essential English Dictionary      Clearly "1. To raise, carry, pitch, or pierce with a fork."     indicates that it IS used as a verb. It even means "to pitch." So, if people are all out in the field haying, one would probably hear, "Will you fork that hay into a pile, please." "Please", if the farmers are polite." "That" if you are referring to a specific bunch of hay."    Basically, the sentence is correct, according to the dictionary!  \/  BUT, if you are looking just to make it clearer, say if you are writing a story, you could say, "Clem, the pitchfork is over there. Please fork that hay into a pile." The other sentences are good, particularly the last two before me.|`|Wbz8Q6ztaa	Will you use that pitchfork to move the hay into a pile?|`|a4tVbofzaa	will u use the fork to put the hay in a pile?|`|6a302ded0cb3ae070fbcb6449e4449efaa	Pile the hay.|`|6od8qaU2aa	Will you take the pitchfork and use it to collect the hay into a pile?|`|cxTzaE8Iaa	will you put the hay into a pile?|`|mjUqLKfLaa	Will you pick up the hay into a pile?|`|4kQxbFZTaa	would you please use a pitchfork to move the hay into a neat pile?
79800e8aa542061232982947981d2dffaa	Hey! That's how my school does it. Four classes a semester, then switch to 4 new ones halfway through the year. It equals out to 8 classes, which is what every other high school has, so why should you have more classes?    If you don't have science this semester, you should have it sometime during the course of the year. It's pretty much a requirement. If you're in a class that needs that science credit, then guidance (or whoever makes up schedules) majorly messed up. You need to talk to them for any worries about your classes, credits, and scheduling.    And don't worry about being 11th grade in a 10th grade class. Because really, there is no such thing as a 10th grade class, just a class with a majority of 10th graders. I was a freshman last year and had a senior in my spanish class. If anything, it'll seem much easier. And what are you worrying about? They'll only be a year younger. That's not much difference at all.|`|8a47bf1d6854793a25a251563ff9d837aa	What kind of high school are you in?    I would pssibly suggest getting honors and AP classes.

The honors class really push your mental capacity and the AP courses make the fiery underworld look like a vacation resort.  I am in 5 different clubs and I am the president of one of them.  I have a tough workload but I end up having a lot of freetime because I organize everything and do them ASAP.  Trust me, if you go to my school, free time will be as valuble as gold bricks.

This new world we are moving towards is all about oneness rather than separation.     Psalm 30 verses 11 and 12 are a hymn of thanksgiving (and not time related): 11 You have turned for me my mourning into dancing;  you have loosed my sackcloth and clothed me with gladness,  12 that my glory may sing your praise and not be silent.  O Lord my God, I will give thanks to you forever!  I have no idea if these are the references you are looking for, but they make some sense in your context.

8a47bf1d6854793a25a251563ff9d837aa	Weighted: Your GPA with the extra points you get from taking honors and AP courses.    Unweighted: Your GPA not counting your extra points in your classes.    Lets just put it this way.  Below is a chart for the total GPA points you can get for a class based on the difficulty of a course.    Standard Course  4 for A  3 for B  2 for C  1 for D  0 for F    Honors Course  5 for A  4 for B  3 for C  2 For D  0 for F    AP Course  6 for A  5 for B  4 for C  3 for D  0 for F    Last semester I had these courses and the final grade is next to them    AP Biology 87  English IV Honors  83  Band 96  Theatre Arts III Honors 93    This would be the four GPA points on a weighted scaled    5  3  4  5    You take the four scores, then average them together. (If you don't know how to average scores, you obviously DO NOT belong in high school.  Anyway you add all the numbers together and then divide them by however many numbers you added. For example you add up the four numbers to get a total of 17.  Then since we added four numbers, we divide by 4 for an average of 4.25)  That would mean I got 4.25 on a weighted scale.  The max you can get is 6.0 if you take all AP courses for one semester.  FYI, A semester is a half a year taking four courses.    This would be the points if it was unweighted meaning that no matter whether it is honors or not, you still can only get 4 points max for a A.      3  2  4  4    The total of those numbers would be 13, and the average is 3.25 out of a possible 4.0 score.    I hope that I was enough help for you!

40MY7GHgaa	Hi, Felicia!    Finlands national flower is the European Lily of the Valley - (Convallaria majalis is its botanical name).    Lily-of-the-valley  The lily-of-the-valley was elected the national flower of Finland in 1967, when Finland celebrated its 50 years of independence. The lily-of-the-valley, famous for its scent, has two oval, sharp-pointed leaves and white bell-shaped flowers in a cluster on one side. This beauty belongs to the lily family.
twVyisGnaa	The law of attraction is when you use the power of your mind to be able to accomplish literally what it is you want.  It all depends on your positiveness.  If your mind is filled with negativity, then all you will recieve is negativity.  The law of attraction works in these 3 ways:  Ask, believe, and recieve.  You must have a positive state of mind to make these 3 steps work in your favor.  A little action from yourself won't hurt either.  What interests me about the law of attraction is that before I heard about it, I never knew how powerful thoughts can be and what they can create.  In summary, what you think is what you get.    What I would write about for the 3 topics would be:    1)  All the friends I've had and how I met them.  2)  How I want to be a Librarian and English Lit. Major as well as Japanese fluent.  3) My interest in the internet and literature.    VIVA LA RAZA!

lQIKWXDuaa	Go to a state college do better and do lots of internship and apply to Yale law. As far as Yale college go, I doubt you will get in. But you are more than welcome to try. You should try. Hey you never know.    ss|`|hLdIO43Xaa	Since you are only a sophomore, you have time.  It's your junior year that counts.  But honestly, if your junior year looks like this too, then you are totally way over your head.  Here is what you need to do:  -You need to beef up those grades to the highest grade possible---an A. Yale does not want an average student. They pick the best. They don't even need to send out little college info brochures because the best people come to THEM, they don't go up to other people  -For academics, take the challenging classes. If your school offers APs, for you, just choose enough that you can handle it, and work hard to get a super high grade!  -As a general guidelines for SATs, Yale, Harvard, Princeton, etc. will not look at the rest of your application unless you get at least 2100 out of 2400  -Tutoring is great! It shows your knowledge and that you care about helping people  -Speaking of showing your knowledge...consider taking the SAT 2's after junior year. Pick 2 subjects. Yale requires 2 of them.  -You need to join extracurriculars. Make sure you enjoy them, make sure that you show dedication and interest. Also, make sure it "counts." Joining a bird-watching club is fun and you can do that, but its not as impressive as joining a community service club  -Speaking of community service...YES! Volunteer at the animal shelter. The Ivies are not for straight bookworms. They want people who want to help and better the world. Do as much community service as you can.    If junior year comes and you are struggling, you are better off going to state school and then going to Yale Law for grad---that's okay.  You have your work cut out for you.    Good luck    p.s. don't you have a high school guidance counselor? you should talk to them if you do, it's their job to get you into college.|`|HJbqA4hkaa	You have absolutely no chance now Sweetie, but there's always grad school.|`|iLTlJszaaa	Sorry, your grades aren't good enough.  But don't worry, like all the Ivy League schools, Yale isn't all it's cracked up to be.  It's not for everyone.  And yes, do get involved in other activities, as long as they don't hurt your grades.|`|AqWRI3G5aa	thats a B, C, C, B, D, C, C, D    terrible grades, im sorry  go to a different college first and transfer to Yale later if you truly want to go there    Don't let your bad grades stop you from becoming a lawyer, but you should try much harder because anything less than your best is cheating yourself|`|jqIcKWgTaa	I'd say give it up uness your parents are millionaires+ and will donate a nice sum. I suggest that if you still have a dream to attend an IVY league school, get your butt moving in undergrad then try to get into Harvard's law school.     Good luck!    EDIT: People with 100 averages, 2400 SAT scores and many, many extra curriculars get rejected all the time. There's really nothing to be done. Sorry for killing a dream.|`|0PdSK2LVaa	you are wasting your time.|`|JTouSBEnaa	Joining a club or sport would show that you care about your school, but not joining doesn't say that you don't.  I'll give you an example to help you here:  There was a man we studied in English Lit. earlier this year (he was a writer, and I cannot remember his name) who had terrible grades, and didn't participate in school. He didn't really care about college until later on, and he tried applying for tens of colleges, but didn't get accepted due to his grades.  Later, sometime after receiving all of these declinations, he straightened out, and rewrote Michigan State, one of the colleges he had applied to, and sent in a new (and improved) application letter, saying that he had changed, and really did wanted to learn, and that his past performances did not reflect the person he was now. He was accepted, because of this.    The point is that if you really want to get into a good college, you just need to keep your grades up, and volunteering can't hurt! Colleges will definitely look at the volunteering and tutoring as a plus. If you're really worried about your grades, consider getting your own tutor as well, that will also show Yale that you care how you're doing, and how you can improve.    I can't tell you much in the way of SAT scores, or GPA, though. Your best bet here would be to go to their site, and look up the info.    I hope I helped, even a little bit.  =)|`|SpfAjQkJaa	Hi,  Well I hate to say this- and I am sorry. But, you wouln't get in, (As far as I am concerned), it is not impossible but.. Anyways there are many other great schools you can consider. Ivy League has ridiculous standards,- the best of students don't get in. Yale has like a 10% acceptance rate. So only 10% of all applicants get in, almost everyone get rejected- not ot seem pessimistic(it is the truth) There are other schools that would be better for you. Ivy League is not for everyone.    It is great that you want to be a lawyer! You could get into one of your state universities, do really well there, then you could go to an very good law school.   Your grades need to get better- you failed a class.  ** Sidenote: Do you live in the US and go to public school. Isn't it that anything under 60 is failing? Right?   Anyways, you can't fail classes whatsoever, and you have to get top grades if you want to get into a good university. Barely passing is not going to get you anywhere. I am serious.   You are only a sophomore(like me) and you have time to get better and improve. The more you improve the better chance of you getting into the college of your choice. It sucks! But without good grades it will be hard. Also remember there is hope. That should not even be a question, you should try to do better with or without Yale.   Moving one, colleges are very serious about extracurriculars ot activities outside of the classroom. Academics are not everything. And I understand the whole- going home straight after school. I do it too, but I have to get involved. Problem is I can't do sports, or have no interest in outside school activities like clubs. But I do reccomend you doing something. Some are very low commitment, or sports if that is more your thing. The volunteering at an animal shelter WILL help you. Colleges love that stuff. Go for it!   Oh- you don't know what a GPA is. That is so important! GPA = grade point average. So it is all your grades added together and then averaged. It basically shows what your grades are without having to look at every single class. The highest is 4.0, that is for people with straight A's. Usually on your transcript or reportcard they tell you your gpa. Top colleges like 3.50 or higher. That is having mostly A's and some B's. It is very hard to do.. I would work to have a gpa of atleast 3.0. I hope I explained it well!   Did you mean SAT's, as in the test? Well it is a test you take that judges your reading, verbal, and math skills. It is out of 2400. There are two parts each worth 800 points. It, in a way, tests how much you know, how smart you are.(I don't really agree.. but whatever) Every student that wants to enter college has to take it(I think). You can't fail but top colleges want very good scores.   I have explained everything generally. If you want more information, you should talk to your school conselor. They will give you everything you need. There is also this website called College Board, that is amazing. Try it- www.collegeboard.com.(It has everything you need to know about your grades and every college out there)   Hope I helped!!  Good luck  ~~Steph  ~~Stephanie
6tRN09Sdaa	The best choice would be to go to a "real" college, and by that I mean is to go to WSU. They would be more challenging than a Community College and you would have the college experience. But I am sure you will get into UofW. Good Luck. :)
hLdIO43Xaa	Definitely yes! Colleges want to hear YOUR unique voice. Speaking in the 1st person is their favored perspective.

F3mrZY50aa	It is pretty simple; you just need to write out everything step by step to see it:  we'll call the amount invested "N"    "25% of a client's investment be placed in a 4% annual simple interest tax-free account" would be written as 25%N x 4% (this is 25% of the amount invested times the rate of interest)    "40% be placed in 6% certificates of deposit" would be written as 40%N x 6%    "the remainder be placed in a 9% high-risk investment" would be written as 35%N x 9% (the 35% is the remainder of the investment, as 100% - 25% - 45% would be 35%)    So you then take everything above and have it equal the amount of interest earned, $6550.    (25%N x 4%) + (40%N x 6%) + (35%N x 9%) = 6550    Next you do the math for each part.    (.25N x .04) + (.40N x .06) + (.35N x .09) = 6550    which is   .01N + .024N + .0315N = 6550    which is  .0655N = 6550    which gives you the answer  N = 100,000    You can even check it after to make sure you got the right answer:  25% of 100,000 = 25,000; 25,000 x 4% = 1,000  40% of 100,000 = 40,000; 40,000 x 6% = 2,400  35% of 100,000 = 35,000; 35,000 x 9% = 3,150    1,000 + 2,400 + 3,150 = 6,550|`|AA11357056	.25(.04)x + .40(.06)x + .35(.09)x = 6550  .01x + .024x + .0315x = 6550  .0655x = 6550  x = 100,000|`|pdbc4souaa	First, I recommend that you find an account that  will meet the criteria of the problem:    investment be placed in a 4% annual simple interest tax-free account,    Bernie Madoff is out of business now.

I am not sure. I know there is 4 years of college + 4 years of optometry school. I am not sure how long their residency program is after optometry school.

Accounting and lawyers are statistically some of the least happy people. With law school you get huge student loans and then you have to spend your first few years out of college working 80-hour weeks to claw your way up in the rankings at a law firm, and not making nearly as much money as you think you would.  I think the market will be flooded with accountants for awhile with all the Wall Street layoffs.    Med school is super high-stress and expensive, and then the loan payments and malpractice insurance eat up a lot of what looks like a great salary on the surface.  Plus many medical specialties are very high stress and leave you very little of a personal life.

mhFpZT3laa	I think the biggest things to get into medical school, aside from GPA and MCAT scores, are that you have had interesting and meaningful experiences in:  1) Community Service  2) Medically related volunteering/work  3) Research (most important for those wanting to go to a research heavy school)    Everything else that you do outside of these three areas is what makes you unique, interesting, and can only improve your chances. I personally feel that one of my strongest features when applying was my dancing experiences. These three things, especially 1 and 2, are critical to many schools, because it shows both a tendency towards compassion and charity, as well as provides you with a basis to prove why you want to go to medical school. Because of this, here are my personal recommendations on selecting a school.    1) Has a research program that is large enough to sustain undergraduate participation.  Look for schools that have undergraduate thesis projects, undergraduate fellowship positions, etc. A school with Research 1 designation is great, because that means there are tons of research projects going on. If you never publish or present a paper, that's fine. However, doing so can be a major boost, especially if you are author or co-author, or even 29th author of a paper that makes it into a major journal like Nature. It does not necessarily have to be medically related research, but I would recommend it if you are contemplating MD/PhD.    2) A moderately well known school.  I personally would recommend limiting your choices to one of the top 200 or so schools. You want a school that has had a decent number of pre-meds, because this increases the chances of an admissions committee knowing something about the opportunities available at your school. It also increases your chances of getting good advising from a pre-med office. I am a member of the faction that believes that prestige is not a significant factor in the admissions process. Having gone to a public school that isn't even ranked in the Top 100, I have interviewed at a number of the Top 20, 10, and 5 schools. I personally believe that your own merits outweigh the name of your school significantly. This is not to say that I believe a 3.5 is the same as one school than another. Admissions committees often have "experts" on a given school, or look at statistics like the average GPA and MCAT score of pre-meds in past years. Thus, a 3.5 at Princeton might be more impressive than a 3.5 at John Doe public school, simply because the average GPA and MCAT score at Princeton is a 3.5/33, and a 3.5/28 at John Doe. Clearly, it was harder to earn a 3.5 and 33 at Princeton than a 3.5 and 33 at John Doe (though, the equal MCAT scores would somewhat minimize this). Suffice it to say that a 3.5 and 28 at Harvard isn't going to beat out a 3.8 and 31 at John Doe, all other things being equal. This being said, I feel that opportunities at the more prestigious undergrad schools outside of academics are excellent. However, I feel that any big public school like OSU, ASU, etc will have similar opportunities by virtue of their sheer size. Any school that made it in the top 200 should have enough of everything for you to succeed if you are good enough. If you are good enough at one place, you are good enough anywhere, so long as you aren't handicapped.    3) A School with a medical school or that is near one.  The inside man always has an advantage. If you went to Harvard College, you will have a stronger shot at Harvard Med. This is because you have three years to build relationships with the medical school, do research under doctors affiliated (and thus get letters) with the school, and become an expert on that school. The opportunity to work with doctors at any medical school probably increases your chances everywhere. There is always the chance that they will be recognized, and its a great way to get insight in academic medicine.    4) Go to a school near a reasonably sized city.  Cities have a lot going for them by virtue of their huge populations. There are all sorts of activities available in research, community service, and just fun things that will make you a more well rounded and interesting person. Being near a city means you will also be near at least a few good hospitals or clinics. This saves you on travel time and ease of access, as it is likely students from your school have already built connections with nearby schools.    5)If you want to get into academic medicine, I strongly recommend some form of teaching or tutoring.  Showing that you have an interest in teaching and academia is best done through these sort of activities. They are also very likely to give you some excellent talking points about being a life long learner. Overall, teaching is just a great extra curricular, and it will probably help you relate to interviewers (many who are academic physicians).
KrdOKdJcaa	I'd say your stats are strong, and you have a pretty good shot at all of the schools you mentioned. You're a male from a mid west state, which actually makes it a bit easier (as opposed to being a female from NY or something). Keep your grades up, keep up your extracurriculars, and work hard in your APs. Good luck!|`|b70uKkC6aa	in everywhere|`|cwqB4j0uaa	are you kidding me with that SAT score  you can get into whichever college u want!!! i am a freshman and i would like to have that SAT score when i take it...as of the ACT...how much was it out of but i think that u have a great chance of getting into either one of those colleges.....and with all of those extracurriculars...you will do fine !!!GOOD LUCK!!!|`|w7ypfscBaa	I think you've got a better than 90% chance at UW, I got in with a 3.3 (but 2100 SAT) but you're way more qualified haha.|`|iI36w7wVaa	You've got great grades, awesome SAT scores, and a whole lot of Extra activities.

But being that those are all pretty much state schools. You should get in easily.  Check out Iowa too, it is a blast!
SIhxrxD3aa	You're right, you'll get more money single.  If you get married you will have to report his income on your FAFSA.  That will lower your EFC and might affect how much financial aid you recieve.  It definitely depends on how much he makes though.  You have to fill out the FAFSA (financial aid application) every year even if you don't get married and nothing changes.|`|AA12374240	if you are single, you will only include your and your daughter's information on the fafsa (financial aid application). if you are married then you would also include your husband's. if your income is low and his is high, that would more than likely make you less eligible for a grant. if your income is higher than his, there's no way around that but adding him to the household might (and that's a big might) make you more eligible.
CF4wfTYNaa	this question won't really tell you much about how to study for college some people just are not study people.  they don't need to study to retain info and most people in ivy league schools are those kids that never study but pass all their tests.   I am not a study person but i pass all my tests as long as i  was present for the lessons .  I review my notes the day b4 the tests.   how do u study in HS if its working it will most likely work in college
sVV0VO6Jaa	First of all, are you good financially? because medicine is a really expensive carrier. If you don't you can apply for FAFSA.    Medicine take 8 years completely, 4 years with basic stuff like chemistry, biology physics, calculus...If you continue with your good grades in high school and good score in the SATs they could probably exonerate you from a couple of those subjects in college.     Like I said its a 8 year thing so, you first have to apply for college (4 years) and then you apply for medical school( 4 years more), when your finish with college (great grades) they'll make you take the MCATS excellent score, great chances of getting in, there only 199 medical schools in US and its kind of hard to get in.    When your in your 6 year you'll star with your internship thats when you star making money.    Now answering your question, you can go into any college you want =D its your choice, it all depends in what you looking for. ;) good luck|`|HJbqA4hkaa	These people don't know what they're talking about Sweetie, a 26 ACT puts you out of the running for any top college.

Apply to some private schools and state school like 5 of each. NYU, Columbia, Yale, UCLA, FSU.

U9bQgfY9aa	Poli Sci grads have a very low average income. And consider that most politicians are lawyers, means this is not the way to become a politician.    Basically, there are many more times Poli Sci grads than there are jobs for them. Your chances of using a bachelors in this field are very low. The only real way to use this is to use it to get into law school    My daughter was taking Economics and then switched to doing a dual major adding political science as the work was so easy in comparison that she figured it would not hurt. The combination helped her get a free ride in grad school though in a civil engineering management program.    But really, the BA degrees generally do not lead to high paying jobs. Only Economics and Business do not follow that rule.    But if you want to make a good living with this degree, plan on 3 years of law school after you get the degree.|`|lQIKWXDuaa	Sounds like a good major for wanting to be in the government.

Most local government positions don't pay a lot, and many work a second job to make ends meet.  A minor in business would make that possible for you.  I'd agree with you about law school.

9c34c7a7ad663d73b2aa40d6cd0868d7aa	like the 1st person said, always call them after about a week to check up on your status. also, put up a link to your resume so that we can see if, even with good grades, your resume sucks. What about cover letters? do you just send out a generic one or change it up based on the jobs you send it to?     I got lucky and found a job as admin in a non-profit out of college, but I also applied to about 15 other places, and this was the only place that called me back. As for retail jobs, with your experience you should get a bit more than min-wage, and it's not that bad, it'll give you time to work but also look for another job on your free time.     Money is a must, so get a retail job for now, and keep looking for better jobs every day after work. You're bound to find something, but you'll still be earning some money. But like I said, make sure that some of your friends review your resume and cover letters to make sure you're  not making some dumb mistake on them.

Or consider finding the cheapest place you can find to go to graduate school.

IGSVfbGuaa	Your SAT scores are so so. GET THEM UP.  GPA is solid.  Class rank is good.  Regardless if your school offered AP or not, the deans will see this and think you don't like to challange yourself. IB/AP rank above any other class type, but you are in an honors program which is good, so you don't be "killed off" by this catagory. Also your rank in this is good.    Any of your "one semester" extra cirriculars, just throw those away. Colleges will see those and think you did them only for colleges, not by choice/interest, which may or may not be true. The ones which you've been in for at least 1 year, with a leadership position, will be the one to sell yourself on. The online course is academic. And how long were you in the newspaper? If it's at least one year, that would be good. Also, the 28 hours volunteering part will not help you much. if you want a volunteer service to be really noticed, you need at least 100 hours at one place.    Your awards are ok. Nothing too amazing, not to shatter your feelings, but it's true.    Your personal-part is interesting. To start, I'm sorry to say New York, and the east coast in general, is one of the most competitive states/regions in the US, you will have ALOT of competition, because colleges like a diverse student population of states, countries, and ethnicities. Which brings me to point 2, you being asian, I'm sorry to say doesn't help either. You may be a minority in the US, but not in colleges, but an asian does stand out better than a white person, as racist as that sounds. Not sure how the income will effect you.    COlumbia judges you alot on your writing, so you better hope they love your essay. And I hope your letters of reccomendation were great too. If it's from a teacher, coach, or someone else you've known for a long time, that will mean more than anything.    So, can you get in? Who knows, only the current dean of Admissions. Just remember, thousands of perfect applicants, with perfect grades in the highest courses possible, get turned down every year. SO good luck to you.|`|TTFGJrvXaa	Yes

Think about their body parts and how they move, eat, hear, talk, those are physical adaptations. Try to come up with ideas about how these adaptations help them function in their environment.    Behavioral adaptations are pertaining to their reactions to their surroundings and their fellow dolphins. Think about the fact that dolphins live and travel in pods (or family groups). They enjoy playing games together, they care for their young, and they are one of the only other species outside of humans that engage in sex for pleasure. How do these behaviors help them?

I could buy books, school supplies, pay rent, etc., and still had money to go out and have fun. I think having that financial independence is a big deal in college, something a lot of students lack. If you decide to do this though, make sure it's at a restaurant that has a good reputation and that doesn't keep you there long hours during the school week. I worked for Outback Steakhouse, a great company to work for, and their hours were always reasonable for school.    I would also recommend subbing, so long as your classes are at night. They pay pretty good, and it looks good on a job application.      Other than that, I would recommend doing something for your college. They won't pay as well, but if you can get a job helping other students (working in the library, working in advising offices, etc.) you'll be around others who might help you get a foot in the door career-wise, and you'll have references from your University to back you up.

If you want to become a public speaker, you need a college degree in the subject you will be speaking about.    As for the learning about how to speak in public, just join a Toastmasters Club. There are thousands of them all over. And they are very cheap to join. 80%+ of people whi join become great public speakers.    Both my daughter and myself have been in Toastmasters. For my daughter it has made her a great teacher. She is in grad school right now as a researcher but she also teaches in the faculty of engineering. And she has received rave reviews for how well she can communicate.    SO really, you have to become an expert in your subject and you join Toastmasters.

BUT, the key thing is not by being smart, it's by how u use ur brain.   women tend to work things more neatly and managing time of whatever they're doing. BUT they tend to fall under pressure, and emotions. men don't.

They typically succeed in mathematical/logical thinking and interpersonal skills.    - The average female is increasingly intelligent in comparison to the average male. They generally strive in linguistical/verbal abilities, musical/visual/dramatic skills, and intrapersonal capabilities. They also tend to be more prone to "natural" contemplating.    - The average female is inclined to possessing a higher I.Q. than the typical male.    So, with all facts combined, you can determine some activities that the average male and female can perform. These are only classifications that apply to the average male or female: individual relations certainly vary.    Sincerely,  The Optimum Juvenile

You are doing the smart thing by getting your GED. Becoming a doctor take at least 12 more years. Try to minimize your debt by going to a state college with a good pre-med program. Work hard. Try to do college in three years if you can. Go to summer school. Make sure you do lots of volunteer at a hospital, also shadow MD's and DO's and do Biomedical/ clinical research. ACE the Medical entrance exam (MCAT). Please try to get straight A's in college especially in the pre-med courses. Good Luck    ss    ss|`|U9bQgfY9aa	While most colleges accept the GED, if you cannot handle high school and drop out, it looks very bad because it implies you cannot finish a difficult task.    SInce you are almost old enough to graduate, you should stick it out.    Otherwise, consider instead staying in the system and if your school district offers it, transfer to Independent study. My daughter was very ill during high school and did her entire high school at independent study, where she only went in for one morning a week.    By wirling at her own faster pace, she graduated a year early and now at 21 is already in graduate school.    And over 200 schools, including Harvard tried to recruit her.    Another alternative here in California is the CHSPE exam. If you write this exam and pass it, you have your high school diploma right now. We did not learn about this until half way through her senior year. She wrote it and passed it. Thus, she got both her high school diploma from the school district and her GED from this exam. See if your state offers an equivalent of this exam. I noticed her high school never offered for her to take this test as I think they did not want to admit there was a shortcut out.    Good luck.|`|jqIcKWgTaa	Take high school online then you still get your diploma. You can complete it at your own pace.     Good luck!|`|rpRzeGN5aa	Most community colleges do, and a number of traditional 4-year colleges do (though some won't view it as equivalent to a high school diploma, so it won't be viewed as well as if you had an actual diploma.)  But you can go to the GED official test site and see a list of schools that accept it.
ISWrs9G2aa	Do you know which 4-year college you're going to go to? If so, make sure that the community college courses you take will transfer by talking to your academic adviser at the community college.  They will be able to help you figure out exactly which courses will transfer, and those are the best ones for you to take.  The classes will be your basic English, math, etc.     After you transfer, you will have to declare your major at the 4 year college.  I'm guessing that will probably be history with an education minor, although you'll have to ask your adviser about what the teacher certification requirements are in your state.  There will be a certain number of credits you need to take within your major, and that will be most of what you are doing for the latter two years of college.    Each state has different requirements to be a teacher.  They all require a bachelor's degree and some form of certification.  In some states, you have to have a degree in the subject you're going to teach.  In some you have to have a certain amount of coursework in education.|`|s9ZUMI5maa	Math, Science, Social Studies, and English.

dWvg3GmFaa	Tyr to create a balance between diolouge and plot. Some people write too much diolougue, and you aren't really able to picture the sceane with decription . When they do that I feel like being left in the dark. With too much plot you start wondering how two charcters interact with eachother through speech.     Try using variations of ways to begin a sentence. If first person don't start it with "I" alot, if third person don't start it with the main characters name.     It helps if you keep up with the tence, don't change it. Like if you begin with a tone of past tence keep it in the past. Like, "One day we had gone to school," Had is past tence.     Create a certain tone to the story, and lots of decriptions so the reader gets a clear picture.     Hope this Helps you out?!

AHnSc9Sdaa	Similar to the Nation's experiences across the North American continent:    (1) Population increases basically displaced the Nations from territory they used for hunting and fishing and, for nomadic groups, reduced their ability to spread their food gathering across many natural resources.  Additionally, more non-Nation people made discriminatory practices easier to commit.  The Nations lost both access and recourse for complaint.  Moreover, traditional conflict settling approaches were not available between the Nations' citizens and the new immigrant and imperialists.    (2) Reserves effectively destroyed the lifestyle of the Nations' peoples and relegated them to being dependent on their enemies/oppressors/benevolent masters for their very survival.  For a peoples used to high levels of self-sufficiency, this was anathema and completely undid the traditional roles within the tribal structure.  Breadwinners weren't breadwinners anymore.    (3) Residential schools isolated Nation students during particularly impressionable ages and allowed the rising dominant culture to indoctrinate these students.  Depending on the age, these children might return to their families unable to even speak their Nation native language.  Additionally, the children would return with habits and behaviors of their teachers rather than manifesting the teachings of their parents and ancestors.  Historically, schooling like this has been used to destroy the culture of many indigenous peoples.  In Australia, for example, Aborigine children were actually kidnapped and then taken hundreds of miles away to "schools";  many died trying walk back to their communities and families.    (d) The limitations to normal Nation access to hunting and fishing resources rendered them helpless to sustain themselves in the ways they always had.  The Nations would also find themselves unskilled to make a sufficient living to buy foodstuffs for their families, or worse, they would be discriminated against - denied the jobs they needed or exploited by being over-worked and under-payed for what work they could find.  Unused to "paying for" or "buying" food, families would suffer greatly.    (e) For those members of the First Nations who believed in ownership principles, it can be said that resources and the development of them began with the taking of those resources from the First Nations.  Land that had been accessible to all was suddenly the "property" of foreign immigrants.  Mineral wealth was never rightly paid to the Nations who had inhabited the areas for centuries.  And of course, without full "citizenship" the Nation's protests fell on deaf ears because they had no rights within the rugged frontier environment they experienced.    All in all, the Nations First Peoples suffered grievous harm that has yet to be recompensed by many who enjoy much of what was taken from them.    Hope this helps!

swL7bQfAaa	Ahhh, I loved the Lone Ranger!  Although the Lone Ranger's last name was given as Reid, his first name was not revealed. According to the story told in the radio series, the group of six ambushed rangers was headed by Reid's brother, Captain Dan Reid.    There existed another title sequence, one more common to syndication, briefly telling the Ranger's origin and how he first met Tonto. The theme was sung by a male chorus, and the lyrics are as follows:    Six Texas Rangers (Hi-yo, hi-yo) rode in the sun (Hi-yo, hi-yo); Six men of justice rode into an ambush, and dead were all but one.    One lone survivor (Hi-yo, hi-yo) lay on the trail (Hi-yo, hi-yo); Found there by Tonto, the brave Injun Tonto, he lived to tell the tale.    (Hi-yo Silver, Hi-yo Silver away! Hi-yo Silver, Hi-yo Silver away!)    His wounds quickly mended (Hi-yo, hi-yo) and then in the night (Hi-yo, hi-yo), Six graves were put there to hide from the outlaws that one had lived to fight.    He chose silver bullets (Hi-yo, hi-yo) the sign of his name (Hi-yo, hi-yo); A mask to disguise him, a great silver stallion, and thus began his fame.    (Hi-yo Silver, Hi-yo Silver away! Hi-yo Silver, Hi-yo Silver away! THE LONE RANGER IS HIS NAME!)       This version of the opening credits was first seen in the episode "Lost City of Gold."    In later episodes the opening narration ended with: "With his faithful Indian companion, Tonto, the daring and resourceful masked rider of the plains led the fight for law and order in the early western United States. Nowhere in the pages of history can one find a greater champion of justice. Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear. From out of the past come the thundering hoofbeats of the great horse Silver! The Lone Ranger rides again!" Episodes usually concluded with one of the characters lamenting the fact that they never learned the hero's name ("Who was that masked man?"), only to be told, "Why, he's the Lone Ranger!" as he and Tonto ride away|`|CmHLKKODaa	Tonto wasn't a ranger ?    : )|`|tManvxfQaa	Cause he was a ranger...Tonto wasn't !!

Heres from a website    The Lone Ranger was one of six Texas Rangers who were ambushed while chasing a gang of outlaws led by Butch Cavendish. After the battle, one "lone ranger" survived, and was discovered by Tonto, a Native American who recognized the survi-vor as John Reid, the man who had saved his life earlier. Tonto thereafter referred to the ranger as "kemo sabe," which is trans-lated as "trusty scout." After Tonto helped him regain his strength, the ranger vowed to hide his identity from Cavendish and to dedicate his life to "making the West a decent place to live." He and Tonto dug an extra grave to fool Cavendish into believing all six rangers had died, and the ranger donned a mask to protect his identity|`|P0WyZU8Uaa	He's called the Lone Ranger because he was the only Ranger left alive after an indian attack.

lYUCqNwVaa	This is what happened before the fire, Anna was kissing her boyfriend but then she left cause he wanted sex. She goes to her house and looks through the key hole and sees her dad making love to the nurse. This makes her so angry that she wants to burn her house down. She fills the water can with oil but forgets the close the valve complete causing the oil to continue leaking. When Alex closes the door, the lantern falls causing the small house to explode killing her mom and sister. This caused her to cut herself and not accept what happened. They send her to a hospital for help and she meets another girl, Mildred Kelp, who tells Anna all her stories. On the day of Anna's release, her doctor tells her to go finish what she started and Mildred tells her she will be back, this foreshadows the future. When she gets home she blocks the facts of what happened the night of the fire and lives her own imagination. She still believes that her sister is alive. Her dad's girl friend all was trying was to be a good mother, but Anna did not see that. The reason she changed her name was to get rid from her past life, she was innocent. Anna believed that she was Mildred Kelp because of the necklace, needles and the way she acted. She had needles because she was a nurse and the necklace was just a coincident. At the end the fathers girlfriend tells her that all she wanted was to be a good mother and she took that away from her, which foreshadows her death. At the end Anna kills her. Also she kills her boyfriend by pushing him off a cliff because he says he saw what she did but she was outraged. At the end she finishes what she started (which is uncertain) and returns to the hospital

kpi69PHWaa	You're right, it will take longer than those six days to grade and send the report of your SAT. Is there any opportunity to take the ACT earlier than that? Many schools accept either, and an ACT score can be translated into an SAT score.     If the ACT is not an option, call the admissions office and talk to an admissions officer, find out if taking the SAT at that time will do you any good.     And try no to be too aggravated about the long turn around time. There's a LOT of applications coming in this time of year (thousands and thousands) and there's a lot of organizing the transcripts, letters of recommendation, and tests scores that goes on before the admissions office even gets to see your file.

In its place was a silver screw.       All the doctors told his mother that there was nothing they could do. Like it or not, he was stuck with it ......       He was screwed.       All the years of growing up were real tough on him, as all who saw the screw made fun of him.  He avoided ever leaving his house...   thus, he never made any friends.       One day, a mysterious stranger saw his belly and told him of a Swami in Tibet who could get rid of the screw for him.       He was thrilled. The next day, he took all of his life's savings and bought a ticket to Nepal .       After several days of climbing up steep cliffs, he came upon a large Monastery. The Swami knew exactly why he had come.  The screwy guy was told to sleep in the highest tower of the Monastery and the following day when he awoke,  the screw would have been removed. The man immediately went to the room and fell asleep.       During the night while he slept, a purple fog floated in an open window. In the mist floated a solid silver screwdriver.  In just moments, the screwdriver removed the screw and disappeared out the window.     The next morning when the man awoke, he saw the silver screw laying on the pillow next to him. Reaching down, he felt his navel, and there was no screw there!     Jubilant, he leaped out of bed...... and his butt fell off.         The moral to this is:   'Don't screw around with things you don't understand... you could lose your ***

o3Jpfflgaa	Each paragraph should be about a different aspect of his experience.  A topic sentence will introduce what the paragraph will be about and the rest will expand on the topic with details.    If you have difficulty following that, then simply introduce your grandpa at an earlier time (when he was healthy and active).  After than, lead into a change in lifestyle due to age or unhealthy habits.  Then, get to his heart attack, how he was treated, and how he is now if he survived.    From that, you can summarize you final paragraph or two by stating changes in diet, exercise, and lifestyle.|`|pKXmVgRLaa	Your topic sentences for each of the eight paragraphs should state the aspect of the story that you wish to highlight.  For instance, use the first paragraph to give background of your grandpa.  Use the next paragraph to set the stage for the day the heart attack occurred.  Then, talk about the way the attack affected your family.  Move then to a paragraph that speaks about his recovery.  Then, how his life and the family's life changed afterwards.  Close out the narrative talking about the present and how everyone is dealing...post-heart attack.
Ftkr9jqYaa	When describing such qualities as steadfastness, endurance, and determination to succeed, the expression "indomitable spirit" conveys a more powerful and robust character than mere perseverance.    Perseverance has two primary modern denotations:    1.  Steady persistence in adhering to a course of action, a belief, or a purpose; steadfastness.    2.  Christianity: The Calvinistic doctrine that those who have been chosen by God will continue in a state of grace to the end and will finally be saved.    "Indomitable Spirit" is a book authored by A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, a ex-president of India.  It conveys such features as courage, strength, goodness, creativity, inspiration, purposefulness, power, inner beauty, abiding values, wisdom, enlightenment, prosperity, and leadership.    Thus, whereas perseverance simply connotes striving steadily toward a goal, indomitable spirit suggests an indestructible resoluteness to achieve the goal.

AHnSc9Sdaa	You don't mention your age or grade level so this may prove to be too simplistic but it is easy      You are going to show that heating will increase water's ability to dissolve other substances.    You need:    Thermometer  3 Clear HEAT-RESISTANT glasses or 3 ceramic mugs  Measuring cup for liquids  Measuring spoons - preferably 1/8 teaspoon or metric equivalent  Approximately 2-3 cups of sugar    (1) Fill a glass/mug with water such that Mug  1 water is 40 degrees F  (2) Measure and record the starting temperature  (3) Add 1/8 teaspoon of sugar  (4) Stir briefly until sugar dissolves and disappears  (5) Repeat steps  3 and  4 until the sugar is NOT dissolved when stirred.  Note how many teaspoons of sugar dissolved for that water temperature.  Repeat steps  1- 5 for Mug  2 water (about 100 degrees F) and   Mug 3 water near boiling (170 - 212 degrees F)    Work carefully but quickly as the cold water will want to heat up and the hot water will cool.      If all works well, you should dissolve much more sugar in the hottest water and much less in the cold.  In fact, the near-boiling water should create a super-saturated solution:  heating should allow the water to exceed its calculated saturation point.    It's not complex but it's very impressive when it works.    Hope this helps!
5FDdyYwcaa	It is alliteration, the "and" doesn't matter. I'm in AP English right now and I was able to quote this sentence from Lincoln's second inaugural as an example of alliteration, "public declarations have been constantly called forth on every point and phase", and this as consonance, "At this second appearing to take the oath of the presidential office, there is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the first."  So yeah, you're totally fine in using "strong and stable" as alliteration.  I hope this helps!

I know that there are still stupid people who are prejudice, but I dont' think most of us are. If I see a pretty native american girl, I don't think,"That indian girl's pretty." I think, "That girl's pretty." I just don't get it. I think sometimes we need to all just forget it and go on.  I know I didn't answer your question, I just wanted to make a comment.

Guided practice with intelligent FEEDBACK is what school, or any kind of education, should be.    Like experience, practice does not mean merely repetition.

If, however, you make new mistakes and learn from them continually, then you will truly progress.|`|UtCkgs18aa	I agree completely!    And practice doesn't always make progress. Sometimes, a person can practice something for days, months or even years and never become good at it.
AWDW78ESaa	Once you give the boys what they want (sex) they will not be interested in you anymore and you won't hear from them again. It's because the boys always want what they can't have. Once they get what they can't have then the thrill is gone for them and they go looking for something else that they can't have. It's the thrill of the chase for them. Do only what you are comfortable with and nothing more. However, if you are going to let boys touch you anywhere and everywhere then don't be surprised when one of them forces himself on you and you won't be able to fight him off. I was a high school boy 20 years ago and that's how it was then and things have only gotten worse since then so be careful.|`|gispvL2aaa	Letting them do what they want will only get you a bad reputation, And that's not good at all.

Try it out and if you don't end up liking it then you obviously have other things to try.     best of luck.|`|AA12360257	I to am working in er and have thought the same thing because when I remember it from my teenage years I kinda had fun there making shakes in all.|`|T1QdO9Xgaa	regardless of whether or not you have a degree yea it's odd to actually want to work in fast food. but hey, if that's what you really want then go get that job. you'll probably quit a week later but at least the urge will be out of your system. hah|`|neuprBeGaa	Yes, it is.  For the same amount of effort and even stress, you could make far more money at a professional position.  Taking a minimum-wage job is an inefficient use of your skills - and most people would not be willing to do that.    You'll also have a hard time getting hired.  Any fast-food manager would look at your qualifications and assume that you're just playing around - that even if you do take the job, you'd get bored or annoyed with it and quit in a matter of days or weeks.  They don't like to hire people who will need to be replaced that quickly.|`|tXk1WngXaa	Yes.  You'll get minimum wage and probably no benefits.  You got that degree for a reason-don't waste it.|`|1E0sjoqHaa	think really hard . . .  do you want to spend the rest of your life serving sweaty people????  if u do cool watev  otherwise . . . think about y u want 2 do that and find some other more looked-up-to job that applies to that|`|k0Ewe7mCaa	That's a little weird.

EeArGfskaa	I had to laugh at some of the answers. Not necessarily because they were wrong....just funny as a teacher to see how people perceive us.    I have never been given a curriculum or some "booklet", I do not rely on the textbook - I use the textbook as a teaching tool sure - but you certainly must know more than whats within those pages.    Certainly all districts are different - so thats not to say that some districts do not provide a curriculum - its just that in 17 years in teaching in California - Ive never seen a district micromanage their teachers in this way.     Here are some common ways teachers prepare for a new year - I do some of these things even if the material is the same as it was the year prior.    1. All states have state standards - this is usually an overview of the expected outcomes of a particular class or department. I review these each year. This allows me to decide. If you will review them - you will see they are very detailed.    http://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ss/    2. We are certified in our subject areas: teachers must be credentialed in a broad area - we must prove to the state through testing (CSET, Praxis etc..)that we know our broad areas. I am certified to teach all Biology, Geosciences and mathematics up to grade 12 - but have taught grade 7 life science for the last 10 years.    3. We have to keep our teaching fresh yearly, so switching subjects within our fields really is not that big of a deal. I spend each summer updating my lessons and presentations to include the latest ideas in science - It would be no different for me to spend the time looking for updates in any other class I am qualified to teach. If they gave me high school anatomy or astronomy - my summer planning would only differ in the content I prepare.    4. There is a style of preparation teachers use called backwards planning - its very common... We look at all the standards, plan our activities, assessments and lessons based on the key elements that our state and often our districts ask us to focus on.    5. I would spend alot of time looking for *things*. As a teacher you collect small things to make points or emphasize certain areas in your class. If I had a new subject - this would be where I would feel the need to go out and get things. Small example: I have quite a number of items geared towards 7th grade curriculum I use to show in class to make points: models, materials, posters etc. If I were to be given that Astronomy course - I certainly would go out and look for a telescope... because my microscopes wont help much.    Good luck to you - hope some other teachers give you an idea of what *they* do.|`|aLgLVOTFaa	They have a booklet that shows them what they need to teach so they reveiw over it an dthen finds a good assignment to give out an di would i know this cause i used to talk to my teacher about and so he showed me his book and told me that he chooses his topics  about what he wants to teach to his students but other then that they read it of a papmlet about the levels in each grade...|`|s9Uufsr0aa	-mandated curriculum from government  -text books & teaching aides  -support from other teachers that have taught the class before|`|1khVEE6oaa	The content and varies by state and even by school district.  However, most states have standards outlined for the essential knowledge and skills that MUST be taught for each subject and grade level.  They are just a basic guideline to follow that most states provide.    School districts often have a curriculum laid out for each grade and subject that includes the rough outline of necessary knowledge and skills that the state provided, but not all of them do.  At some schools the teachers can create their own curriculum, this is particularly true in small districts or private schools.  Other than the state mandated guidelines and the curriculum that the school district may or may not have laid out, teachers also rely on their textbooks and the experience of older teachers in their schools which are both a valuable resource when planning lessons or curriculum.    As for your question regarding taking college classes in the summer to prepare for the upcoming year, that also depends on the state.  Some states issue probationary certificates that expire every 10 years or so and then must be renewed by passing a certification test.  Those states, however, usually also have some sort of exemption in place for teachers who, while teaching, took professional development courses in their content area or taught a certain number of classroom hours in their subject.  Other states offer permanent certificates that never expire, even if the teacher doesn't teach for a few years and then returns to the profession.  School districts and even states sometimes enforce a minimum requirement for the number of hours a teacher must attend professional development courses pertaining to their subject matter.  It really just depends.|`|50WCN0graa	State Standards and ongoing Professional Development.     And yes, they learned stuff in school. You can only teach math if you are a certified math teacher. You can only teach social studies, if you are a certified social studies teacher.|`|C9xguzBXaa	because they learned it how do you think they know it|`|ATqWlp8aaa	Usually a curriculum is provided by the Board of Education. They also attend certain classes that sometimes the school even pays for if they need refresher courses.|`|At2JL4MVaa	The are given curriculum. They're given basically a list saying what they have to teach, and if they teach all of it fast enough, they can add something else they would like to teach.    There are requirements of what they have to teach for someone to pass the class. basically class requirements.|`|7a9ca1e0d676415430d900245a7c2d25aa	There are stores that teachers buy the material from. They also buy the answer keys and sometimes get them in advance. They also teach classes that they have studied for. If their major was Social Studies, then that is probably something they will look for a job in. All teachers are required to take both English and Math. When you apply for a job as a teacher they will ask what skills you have and take that into consideration.

CZfUO2kcaa	If I were you I would take public speaking or improvisation. Public Speaking is a great class, teaching not just about speaking in front of people, but how to interact with a wide variety of personalities. It is wonderful for building self confidence and you'd meet all sorts of folks and make good contacts. Improvisation is fun too. It's about how to think on your feet and be articulate.    I am not sure if these classes are electives as I have taken them to fulfill a humanities requirement for my AS.    On the flip side, take a class that intrigues you; something you know nothing about but are interested in learning. I would definitely go for the photography class if it sounds interesting to you. I'll bet that it is a blast!    Which ever class you end up choosing make sure to ask the instructor for help if you need it. That is what they are there for and like to help!|`|0CA2FJ48aa	I think photography would be a good choice-it is a fun, and easy way to get another credit.

I know people who are poor with numbers and Math, but very good in remembering names of places and people.

hmA8nfA2aa	During police training, you should expect to learn a lot in a relatively short amount of time. You should expect to be challenged mentally and physically.    If you want to become a police offficer, one of the best things that you can do is to earn a college degree. As far as education goes, some police departments only require their officers to have a high school diploma or GED. Some police departments require their officers to have a two year degree or equivalent. Some police departments require their officers to have a four year degree or equivalent. Even if a particular department does not require a degree, you will have a better chance of getting hired if you have one. Some departments pay their officers more if they have a degree. Having a degree could also benefit you when trying to get promoted after you become a police officer. Choose a major that interests you and that would be useful for police work. Criminal justice, psychology, forensic science, a foreign language, accounting, and computer science are some good examples. While in college, learn as much as you can, and earn the highest GPA that you can. Be a good person, maintain a good reputation, and don't do anything that you would not want a background investigator to find out about. There are many things that you can do to increase your chances of becoming a police officer. Check out http://www.peaceofficerjobs.com for excellent information and advice about becoming a police officer. Good luck!|`|asX2hxFXaa	Law, security and criminal behavior would be great classes.

I want to be a cop too, but I'm not sure of how my past as a teenager will play out and all the drugs I did.  You must pass a lie detector test, which I would be 100% honest on, but I'm not sure how they would view me since I did drugs as a teenager.  I'm 33 now, so that's ancient history and I would never touch them again.  You do stupid things when you are young.  Good luck.  I hope you make it.|`|ZjrFsYz5aa	Yeah you should get a Associates degree in criminal justice.   but before that you should see if you can pass the written police test before you waist 2 years then are not able to even pass the general police test. They have a test just to test if you can at-least read write and add and subtract then the police tests comes later.

o3Jpfflgaa	I've made a few small changes  (a) take out inappropriate words,  (b) make the 'person' and 'voice' consistent,  (c) start paragraphs where needed, and,  (d) added the last sentence of the FIRST paragraph in order to connect your mother to your learning).  That is a nice bit of writing!  Congratulations!    She built a kingdom of knowledge with a third grade education. She has more wisdom than the intellectuals who claimed to be philosophers. Her voice could turn the stubborn to the right direction, her hands could feed the world. When injustice filled my heart with anger, disgust and resentment, it was in her arms that I discovered the power of forgiveness. She is not a divine creature, thus there is no way that she could suddenly change the negative feelings that I carried in my heart. However, I learned from her to liberate myself till I let my heart heal from within.    I came to realize and understand that a young heart must liberate itself from the dark relics of its past in order for it to reach the dream that it fights for. Regrets can only hold it in an abyss and make it bitter.    Sadly, a heart that is rotted by bitterness can become a dark nest where hate grows. I should not hate my imperfections because hate makes one blind and obstructs judgment. It is hard to forget past mistakes and forgive those who have hurt.  Instead of moaning on what has been done, I ask God for the courage to accept the things that I cannot change and the wisdom to change what I can.|`|ugRN86bYaa	You need some kind of topic sentence. It's very unclear that you're talking about your mother. But assuming you are: the first half of the paragraph talks about your mother, but in the second half you ramble on about yourself and and your heart, regrets, mistakes, etc. Then, in the last sentence you're copying the serenity prayer, so you should cite it. The serenity prayer teaches us that .....    You have some good insight and some good ideas, but it''s totally disconnected. If you could somehow relate the second half to your mother or her teachings. Also, your verbs aren't always parallel. For example,  you say "She has more wisdom.... "and then you say, "Her voice could turn...." has is a present tense verb and could is a past tense verb. You've got to get them together.|`|EXBMxFCKaa	Very strongly worded, but I feel like you're rambling and being a bit redundant. I feel that you should be more confident in your writing, there's no need to use a cliched quote like that at the end. Use something that's original and ties together the experience from your perspective.      It's wonderful until you get to ...Sadly, a heart that is rotten by bitterness...    That's where you begin to ramble and the paragraph feels like "filler"    This is how I'd write it:        She built a kingdom of knowledge with a third grade education. She has more wisdom than the intellectuals who claimed to be philosophers. Her voice could turn the stubborn to the right direction, her hands could feed the world. When injustice and impunity filled my heart with anger, disgust and resentment, it was in her arms that I discovered the power of forgiveness. She is not a divine creature, thus there is no way that she could suddenly change the negative feelings that I carried in my heart. However, I was to liberate myself till I let my heart ill from within. I realized and understood that A young heart must liberate itself from the dark relic of its past in order for it to reach the dream that it has always fought for. Regrets can only hold it in a backward abysmal and make it bitter. I should not hate my imperfections for hate makes one blind and obstructs their judgment. Though to forgive and forget is a constant struggle I understand now that I should not dwell on what has been done, I pray for the gift of humility and the guidance that comes with accepting the things I can and cannot change.|`|tXk1WngXaa	Pretty good.  You need to decide if this is in the present or past tense.  If you start off with, "she built," then the next sentence needs to be, "She had," and vice versa.  You have a lot of mismatched tenses, so think carefully about the present or the past.  You also forgot to put in some periods and commas,  "ill" should be "fill."  "A young heart" - the A should be lowercase.  You use a lot of metaphors, which are great, but it would be even better if you would elaborate a little more.  Give specifics.  What regrets?  Why bitterness?  What imperfections?     Once you flesh this out a bit more, it will be really beautiful.

However, if you look closer and analyse the play, Denmark is also poisoned- it's "poisoned" by Claudius' rhetoric and foul deeds. Denmark is described as a weeded garden that is decaying and dying; the fall of King Hamlet's kingdom is caused by a "poisonous" Claudius.    In a way, Claudius' speech/rhetoric is also a form of poison because his words poisons other people's minds (ie: encouraging Laertes to fight Hamlet and tells Laertes to use a poisoned rapier; seducing Queen Gertrude is also an example of his poisonous tongue)
ZGUkizjYaa	There is a difference.    "Michigan" implies that you went one of the world's best 15 universities.

SIhxrxD3aa	Veterinary assistant has different meanings for different clinics.  Many no longer have assistants.  Smaller clinics hire assistants that kind of do everything (receptionist, tech, kennel).  Larger clinics break up these duties.  They have several techs, receptionists and kennel help instead of 1-2 assistants.  Assistants don't need any formal training.  Any schools you've seen advertising a veterinary assistant certificate are not worth it.  Vets don't care if you've got a certifate of veterinary assistance or not and you won't get paid any better with one and it's not any easier to find a job with one.  Especially since not all clinics hire assistants anymore.  A technician attends a 2 year school and earns an associate's degree.  They are also registered with the state after passing national and state board exams.  They are kind of like a nurse for animals.  They give meds, perform tests, assist the doctor with exams and surgeries.  Unlike assistants, almost every clinic hires techs and the job opportunities are growing.

It's a lot of hard work and school for a job that pays 10-12 dollars an hour.  It's very rewarding in other ways, but you'd make more money as a manager at pizza hut, or even working at walmart or safeway.  It seems unbelievable, but its true.|`|WqkFJ2Pgaa	Vet techs are certified, which involves at least a two-year college program.

There is more to membership in Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. than what you see on the surface.  It is truly a joy, but it's also time-consuming.    Time management is important.  If you cannot maintain your studies now, then maybe you are not ready to pursue membership.  Remember, a degree is your first priority.|`|0HYfFZKVaa	If you do not meet the minimum requirement of 2.5 I suggest that you do not apply. That means that you are not ELIGIBLE for membership. You have to keep in mind that there will be so many girls there (probably hundreds) that have GPAs far above 2.5. The best thing for you to do at this time is to remain interested and continue trying to get to the know the girls. In addition work on getting your GPA up to at least a 3.0 so that you can be more competitive. Continue any community service involvement and remain positive. When the next round comes you will be prepared and have a much better chance of becoming a part of this organization.

She was given the perfect chance to apologize to the other wife at the table and choose to remain on the attack and attacked the chubby son instead of answering the question.  The question was something like " How do you think your clients would feel if they knew how rude your husband is to chubby people".  She didn't answer....I don't think she cares...I think she is so busy thinking her family is "above" everyone else that accountability for the things said by either is of little consequence to her.  The washing machine thing...I think she was just putting on I don't think she is THAT stupid.  Washing clothes in a washing machine does not require and kind of  ADVANCED degree.  I also think that as a life coach she leaves much to be desired.  How can you possibly be a positive influence on ANYONE when you live with and support that kind of abuse on a daily basis.

aZiYvOfraa	Empty Walls:    There is no question the song is directly about the Bush administration's censorship of the Iraq war and specifically the choice to ban the media from showing caskets of American soldiers.    "Your empty walls,  Pretentious adventures,  Dismissive apprehension,  Don't waste your time,  On coffins today,"    About how we are just being forced to ignore reality whether or not we even conciously acknowledge so.    "  Don't you see their bodies burning?  Desolate and full of yearning,  Dying of anticipation,  Choking from intoxication,"    About both American and Iraqi casualties that the public is ignorant to.     The video which depicts the twin towers being destroyed, the statue of Hussein being toppled, and even prisoners being taken ends with the children staring at the casket outside. The children who played the war willing and enjoyed it are being seperated from the casket only by a window, an empty wall. There is nothing really there and they choose to see reality but censoring their vision would mean they still think of war as a type of game and run around enjoying it.    In summary, the song is about the government's false protections and how censoring the viewing of caskets decreases critcism of the war and helps Americans avoid the reality that people are constantly dieing from war because they are unable to view the atrocities. While I'm sure these themes can be taken into a broader scope there is no doubt Serj is directly speaking to the casket censorship. An incredible song and maybe the best video I have seen this year.     Unthinking Majority:    "We don't need your democracy."    The term "your democracy" has a double meaning.     1: A republic, which is what the US is. Not a democracy. Yes, the people do vote however they do not vote directly for the events, laws, bills and decisions that effect their civilization but rather representatives whom they entrust to make the decisions the people themselves would, make given the power.    2: He is also saying the "democracy" belongs to the government officials themselves. For instance the 2000 elections where electorally Al Gore won, yet Bush got the office. The patriot act, and thus legalized wire tapings of whom ever the government sees fit thus opposing the people (and the constitutional right to privacy).    "Execute them kindly for me"    Somehow I find it hard to believe that hard core anti war anti genocide activist Serj Tankian would ever advocate the killing of anyone outside a figurative song. He is not saying directly to kill them just as in the song Attack, he is advocating an ending to their reigns be it as simple a step as removing them from power or forcing them to do the will of the Thinking Majority.    "Take them by their filthy nostrils"    The nose is typically a sign of upperclassmanship, ex: turning ones nose up to someone. Looking up the economic ladder at someone who reached their state of income by forcing someone else to suffer thus generating blood money - dirty money - filthy money, turned nose = rich yet rich because of filthy means.    The act of taking someone by their nostrils is something often done by people of authority to those of less authority. Teachers and parents for example. It is also an act which extenuates no retaliation thus suggesting the people have the power to take action against the Thinking Minority that run this fake democracy.    "Put them up in doggy hostels."     The doggy hostels are representing the homeless and extremely poor in the world which are the reason why these senators and governors are able to line their pockets. Here he is saying the rich should trade places with those they oppress and the poor are the ones to instigate this. This is reminiscent of English author John Locke, whose work inspired former (dead) president Thomas Jefferson with the suggestion that it is not the people who should fear their government but the government that should fear their people.    "We don't need your hypocrisy"    This line directly relates to Serj in the sense that publicly schooled (paid for by the government) Americans are taught that genocide is wrong but apparently this only applies when the instigators of the genocide pose a direct threat to the governments authority. The Armenian genocide which few leaders in the US have even mentioned until recent years and decided to finally publicly acknowledge the fact that over one million five hundred thousand men women and children alike were brutally beaten, put to firing squads, and dumped in the deserts of Syria to die. Let alone the modern situation in the Sudan which they could actually do something to stop.    Oh and lets not forget the pharmaceutical industries lobbies whom coupled with the oil industry basically make our democracy a joke and control nearly everything on those two platforms of the government and many others.    Execute real democracy.    A real democracy is one in which the people directly vote for what

sjOelwhhaa	I could give you a better answer if I knew the errors you made, but I'm going to assume they are in adjective clauses.    That and which can be used to refer to things:  The book that/which is on the table is mine.    Who and that refer to people:  The guy that/who is talking to the teacher was late.    When the clause begins with a preposition, you have to use either which or whom:  "Where was the party to which you went?"  You could also say "Where was the party that you went to?" but that clause (that you went to) doesn't begin with a preposition.  With a person:  Where is the guy you were talking about?  OR:  Where is the guy about whom you were talking?      You can't use "that" as a relative pronoun in the examples above.    There is another time when only "which" and not "that" will do, and that is when the clause is not needed to identify the noun.  Here is an example:  My car, which was in the garage, was stolen.  Note that the "which" clause is enclosed in commas.    I only have one car and this clause just gives extra information in the sentence.  It doesn't identify the car, as it does in this:  The car that is in the garage is mine.  "That is in the garage" pinpoints the one car I'm talking about.  This kind of clause takes no commas.|`|tXk1WngXaa	"That" refers to something specific.    Ex: Look at that table!      Ex: Do you remember the time that we stole those cookies?  (That is referring to a specific memory.)  Watch out though!  It would have been better if I had not used the "that" in the last sentence; "that" is often overused and many times unnecessary.  For ex: Do you remember the time we stole those cookies?  See, I didn't need the "that" at all!      "Which" can mean you are asking a question and it gives you a choice.    Ex: Which table is that?  (Is it that one or that one over there?)    "Which" can also connect clauses and it is when you are explaining something.    Ex: I do not like grammer, which is the reason why I should not answer this question.

IwXuWX05aa	Pastor AQUALUNG (odd last NAME, but I suppose many names are odd) is preparing to go out to dinner with his family at the new sushi restaurant when he hears a newsflash on t.v. blaring, "Stay tuned to our report on dirty politics and corruption with Obama, the con man, and the Chicago political machine." (1,2,9)  He clicks the remote control and says to NO ONE there, "I'VE HAD ENOUGH of those Republicans on Fox News.  Matter of fact, I've had enough of all Republicans.  If I met one today, I'd let them have it.  "You sure are old and ugly" undoubtedly would be the nicest thing I could muster up in the way of a greeting. (4)  In a huff, he runs out the door leaving his family behind.  He doesn't even notice they are missing till they drive up behind him as he is getting out of his new Jaguar sports car (given to him last spring as an anniversary gift with a gigantic red satin bow tied on top of the jag,  a white love bunny sitting on the dashboad like IT'S PARADISE BY THE DASHBOARD LIGHTS and a dozen red long-stemmed roses in a box tied with a smaller red bow, this one being velvet).  "Hey, DADDY, DON'T YOU WALK SO FAST," cries his little daughter and, with a tear in his eye as he realizes his rash actions, he scoops her up into his arms.  "DON'T CRY DADDY," whispers his girl as she wipes a single tear away.  His little son then jumps and, holding his baby girl in one arm, Pastor AQUALUNG catches his son in the other.(1,2)  "Hey," complains his baby girl, "He's on top snorting 'Hee Haww, Hee Haww,' like a donkey.(6)  That's not fair.  He's up higher than me."  "Well, sweetie," replies Pastor AQUALUNG, "I'll hold you  and TAKE YOU HIGHER on the way out.(1,2)   And you can  sing "TWEET, TWEET, TWEET,' like a bird.  How's that?"    As they enter the new dinner place, the immediately notice the decor is not quite what they expect..  An old cow head lady (female, that is) is hanging from one of the dining room walls.(3)   She is obviously fresh from a taxidermist.  On two opposite walls are moose and bull heads.  It looks like the Country Bear Jamboree from Disney World (not my favorite attraction there, but then, the Haunted Mansion, the Pirates of the Caribbean, and Space Mountain don't seem to fit in this story...at least not yet).    What a surprise it is when the waitress comes over and it's none other than Minnie Mouse.  "Minnie Mouse at a sushi restaruant?" grumbles Pastor AQUALUNG (1,2).   Mrs. AQUAUNG thinks her husband is acting too silly.  She mumbles too, "Great.  He's clicking his heels and saying,  'I gots me a woman.'  He's making a fool of himself and us....again!" (5)      The children, though, are delighted and suddenly one of the taxidermist heads on the wall breaks into song.  "I am the Emperor of the world who is a generous, intelligent, conservative Republican.(8)  This is our world you've entered.  Enjoy your dinner while we sing for you.  First song up will be WHO SAYS YOU CAN'T GO HOME."  The cow head lady chimed in, "I'm Abdullah the Moooslim hunter.(7...give me half a credit for that..there are U.S. children in this story, after all).  Come join me on my world safari where we can have barbecues and potatoes cooked in every way, even on a BED OF ROSES. Yay!"  ;)    Pastor AQUALUNG abruptly loses his cool, upsets the table, pushes Mickey Mouse the waiter aside, and cries,"I'm outta here!  I hate republican restaurants."(1,2)   He revs up his car and cruises down the LOST HIGHWAY when suddenly, the clouds opened wide, God looked down and said, "I hate you!  (10)  You see  it's my restaurant and I'm a Republican!"      I've numbered the words you wanted used and capitalized some song titles (kiddie songs included)...considering my high level of intelligence, I felt it wasn't as much fun without more of a challenge.  I do hope you excuse my need for greater intellectual stimulation.  LOL.  (Ok, so I googled a few times to see if some of the words were song titles...but the Goo Goo Dolls and Bon Jovi I knew).
AA11432707	High school doesn't make a bit of difference.  Take whatever you like.

In college, major in whatever you want and take the premed courses - a year of physics, a year of bio, a year of English, and two years of chemistry.  If you're doing poorly in high school chem, that doesn't look good for doing well in two years of college chem.  Then you need to keep up a high college GPA and do well on the MCATs.  Med school is another 4 years, followed by 5 years of residency.

I managed to get into grad school--a prestigeous grad school, even--with a BA from UCSC, though I didn't go to med school obviously. A 3.5 GPA is about average for them according to a quick google search, so you should have a reasonable chance of getting in.    And for the record-- it really does help your mood a lot when you go to college in some place as rediculously beautiful as Santa Cruz. If you get fed up with studying just go for a walk through a redwood forest or go enjoy the imposing hilltop vista views of the ocean.

SLFt8eHEaa	To be completely honest they're equally difficult to get into and both get approximately 5 applicants for each place.  I'd suggest that you pick you the one with the course that appeals to you most - that way you'll find it easier to engage with the tutor at interview and make a better impression.  The interviews themselves aren't terribly difficult as long as you know your subject matter.  They're looking for someone who has a real interest in their chosen subject and so if you know what you're talking about then it's more like a discussion than a rigorous interview.<br>  <br>  LSE is also a very good university (we don't call universities schools over here; schools are solely something that kids go to).  If you want to practice law over here (which I'm assuming is the reason that you're getting an English law degree) everybody will have heard of LSE.  It is ranked in the top 5 universities in the country and is very well known and respected.  I can't comment on the interview process as I didn't go there, but I can imagine that it's along the same lines as Oxford and Cambridge.<br>  <br>  Btw, just to correct the answer above, Oxford and Cambridge are NOT Ivy League universities. The term Ivy League only applies to a group of American universities.|`|AhuRfhEDaa	Both are hard, but Cambridge is probably the easiest between Oxford. Both are great universities. Everyone knows about Oxford or Cambridge, they are ivy league schools so don't worry about people not knowing about them.

This is an accredited school, not an "online university".  I really liked it.  I could go to class when it was convenient for me.  The instructors were always available via email, and other students posted answers and questions and opinions.  Part of the grade is based on participation so the student postings are mandatory for a good grade.  Some courses required that I show up at school for exams and others opened exams online for a certain period of time.  Very convenient but a lot of reading.  Each course lasted the length of the semester and the cost was the same whether you took the course on line or in the classroom.  If a course is a hard course, it's hard no matter where you take it.  But because I could sandwich the course work between work and regular classes, I was able to complete my applied science degree about a semester sooner.
H41u0B8Jaa	That is a question you will have to ask the college you intend on going to.  Phone or email them and attach a copy of your transcripts and degree from the online college and see if it is recognize or if some of the credits can be transferred over.|`|AA10023710	If your college was a regionally accredited college, like the U of Phoenix, then you may be able to transfer a few credits from your masters degree there, to another masters degree program at a brick and mortar college. But it depends on the subject. Some masters degrees, in addition to needing the regional accreditation of the uni, also need specific types of professional accreditation. If, for example, you did an MBA at U of P, that MBA isn't AACSB accredited, and some universities may not accept those credits. Others will. You'll need to ask.<br>  <br>  And don't be shocked if your new Masters degree school doesn't accept any of your credits, or only accepts 3, rather than 6. That's not necessarily because you did your other masters online. It happens pretty regularly even between different "offline" masters degrees. Masters programs are sometimes kind of pick re: transfer credits. It's not as easy to transfer credits at the masters level, as it is at the bachelors level. <br>  <br>  So long as your undergrad school was regionally accredited, your bachelors degree will be seen as genuine. It won't be the "online" bit that is a problem. It'll be whether or not the program you're applying to thinks your undergrad school was academically rigorous enough. <br>  <br>  Naturally, if your new school wants you to take the GRE/GMAT etc., and you do very well on those exams, that'll make up for a bit in case they're worried about the rigor of your undergrad school.

Walt Disney    Work like you don't need the money, love like your heart has never been broken, and dance like no one is watching Aurora Greenway    How far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving and tolerant with the weak and wrong...because sometime in your life you will have been all of these. George Washington Carver     Always be a first-rate version of yourself, instead of a second-rate version of somebody else. ~Judy Garland    A baby is God's opinion that the world should go on. Carl Sandburg    When one door of happiness closes, another opens, but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one that has been opened for us. Helen Keller    No act of kindness, no matter how small is ever wasted. Aesop    "Let us endeavor so to live that when we come to die even the undertaker will be sorry." - Mark Twain    Life is   the only chance you get,  how you live it,   what you take from it,   how much you give back,  a joy and a heartbreak,  doing the best with what you have,  loving with all of your heart,  treating all forms of it with respect,  and a wondrous beautiful mystery-C.Yost    Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak, Courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen." Sir Winston Churchill    Whatever does not destroy me makes me stronger.  Friedrich Nietzche     Nine-tenths of wisdom is being wise in time. Theodore Roosevelt    "I sometimes go to my own little world, but that's okay, they know me there." - Joel Hodgson    "Do what you feel in your heart to be right - for you'll be criticized anyway" Franklin D. Roosevelt    "Some people say that I must be a horrible person, but that's not true. I have the heart of a young boy, and I keep it in a jar on my desk." - Stephen King    How many people here have telekinetic powers? Raise my hand. Emo Philips     If you want loyalty - get a dog. If you want loyalty and attention - get a smart dog. Grant Fairley     You would think with all the genius and the brilliance of these times, we might find a higher purpose and a better use of mind. - Jackson Browne, Say It Isn't True    I hope life isn't a big joke, because I don't get it.

Seriously!|`|jR8mclWIaa	What high school teaches is discipline and how to study.  If you don't learn that in high school you probably wouldn't do well in college.|`|iZyLbv6aaa	First of all, algebra and above teach you logic.  History that is indepth and advanced science classes do many things. They teach you discipline (you must study) and they give you interests.  If you want to be a doctor, you obviously should know a little chemistry, right? Well, in high school, you learn whether or not your brain can understand that chemistry.  I am in an advanced government class that teaches about the economy and I take financial planning that teaches how to manage a check book and cash and I also take accounting, which IS neccessary.  I also enjoy analyzing literature. It gives me enlightenment. It helps me to see the world in a clearer way. It takes away some of the stress of work and the economy and it gives me something to think about when my mind is trying to hide away from all the worries of this time.|`|bjcjQ4zfaa	You are entirely right. Education is stale and needs a complete reformation. It completely kills creativity, individuality and self expression. It's based on completely irrelevant information and a "if you can't conform to the system than you are not a valuable person" mentality.    The education system does very little except to teach you how to succeed in the education system -- and even that doesn't work with half the students.    It is unfortunate. Education should be about teaching kids how to find their interests and passions and allowing them to explore that and accentuate their strengths instead of teaching everyone with the same cookie cutter robot model.|`|TPcuI9CCaa	I think that people should go to high school, but they should teach about real life.|`|aGXankr2aa	High School is meant to give you a rounded education.

Although I agree that more real life lessons should be taught at school, History, Literature and even algebra are important to.|`|NrkWd4Aoaa	You might be smart but you are lacking intellectual curiosity.    If AVID is an elective, do you know what an elective is?  It is a class that you can take if you choose ("elect") to take it.  The help is there for you if you choose to take advantage of it.     Point of curiosity on my part?  Do you turn in homework or do you take zeros?  Your pre-algebra math should be sufficient  to calculate that 10 points of perfect "A" averaged with a zero is 50%, which is an F.     Before you learned to read you learned the alphabet.  Think about it, "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"  It makes no sense.  Does that mean that it's pointless to learn the alphabet?      Chemistry is a science that relates to all other sciences.  Cooks use chemistry, people who breathe use chemistry, there is chemistry involved in flying an airplane as well as physical science and physics... also, chemistry is about learning problem-solving.    Shakespeare's plays are challenging, but also more relevant than you'd think.  http://www.fathom.com/course/28701907/se...    Hamlet is about a guy who can't make up his mind  and pretends he is crazy, or is he merely pretending? Did he ever really love Ophelia?  Did he drive Ophelia crazy?  Murder, suicide, revenge, and revenge gone wrong... Murphy's Law: if it can go wrong, it will, with devastating consequences in Hamlet (it happened in Romeo and Juliet, too.)  Some metaphysical life after death issues, suicide, insanity, Post     Traumatic Stress Disorder?,political power plays... the play has been done in the modern setting, too, with Ethan Hawke as Hamlet and Denmark as a modern corporation in Manhattan, he meditates on what is the point of living (to be or not to be... gee, is life just a pointless pain?) while wandering the aisle of Blockbuster...    MacBeth's themes of ambition, the choices people make, the corruption of power, and consequences are timeless.  Shakespeare is logical in his story-telling.  Logic keeps us from throwing our money away, marrying a jerk, following after fools, and making intelligent life choices. Yes Shakespeare is hard to read, but you will have a great vocabulary when you're done.  Et tu, Brute? (Brutus, you're my best friend, but you are with the conspiracy to kill me, too?)      Shakespeare's Henry IV, part I is all about the slacker generation of his era, but it's not all that different from the modern era... you would be amazed to know how many movies are based on Shakespearean plots...  Slackers, My Own Private Idaho, Reality Bites, Clueless,10 Things I Hate About You,  O, Scotland PA, West Side Story...     Is Romeo and Juliet worth the trouble?   http://www.enotes.com/romeo/group/discus...    Shakespeare isn't just murder and tragedy, by the way.  One point of life is to learn... which Hamlet didn't, until it was too late.     "The Merchant of Venice" on the other hand has a happy ending (I am one who sees Shylock as a sympathetic character, and will leave other aspects of the end of this play for you to learn about and reflect on, in the event that you ever read it and learn about the larger context which is, by the way, still relevant today.)    Analyzing literature essays teaches you how to think from a different direction than scientific analysis.  You might get a kick out of page 8 of this power point from Purdue University. owl.english.purdue.edu/workshops/pp/lita... -    I recommend these sites for more clues about literary analysis and why it is worth caring about:  http://www.brocku.ca/english/jlye/critic...  http://www.brocku.ca/english/jlye/uses.p...    Now, about math:      How the economy works, understanding loans, etc involves math.    A lot of jobs use math beyond pre-algebra, e.g. (do you know what "e.g." means?  It's Latin, for "exempli gratia" and the reason we don't use "f.e." as the abbreviation for "for example" is because we already use "e.g." so get over it.)      http://www.collegeworkready.org/video/Pi...    Why is algebra a big deal?  http://www.greatschools.net/cgi-bin/show...    Some other careers that use math beyond pre-algebra:    Auto mechanics:  Advances in technology have changed the components and materials used in cars, and auto mechanics today need to have good math, as well as computer and reading skills necessary to follow instructions in technical manuals that are often computer based.    Carpentry:  Carpenters use algebra and geometry every time they calculate angles to figure out how to cut their building materials.     Real estate:  Agents use math to figure out if a potential buyer will qualify for a loan, and to calculate closing costs and mortgage payments.    Small business:  Owners and managers calculate product prices, employee wages, taxes and advertising budgets. They prepare business plans that include short- and long-term budgets; analyze statistics from customer service surveys and data to figure out the best use of floor space.|`|VWIvlQ2naa	if you really are "smart", then you should know that school really IS important; that all those things you said that are pointless are truly worth your time. i'm a freshman struggling with all my honors classes, but i know that in the end, it'll all be worth it. people don't usually realize how important something is, until they come to the point where they need it. do us all a favor and don't give up, because giving up is just accepting the fact that your a failure.

I'm not saying school is bad (smart people don't get pissed) I'm saying we need to not waist our time.     it is pointless - we need to be preparing for our careers. I'm so pissed when kids are like "i dunno what ima be" and we have to do this dumb test to find out what we will be and it's like I already know! What the **** am I waiting for...Like 8th grade through all of highschool is jsut finding out what you wanna be - what a waist of time for people like us.      When the hell does a pilot need to right an essay from an animal's point of view? This is bullshit.    How about thsoe math equations that take up an entire face of a page?

They teach you this **** because so many kids dunno what they're gonna be so they need to be prepared for everything but I know this **** won't prepare me at all.      I'm reading these answers and everyone is saying it's to prepare you for life - they're those ignorant people I talked about. For smart people like us we need to go our seperate ways.

Lol you got me all excited I feel much better now :)|`|i0gTHNAGaa	"When the hell does a pilot need to right an essay from an animal's point of view?"  That's a really good point, Zach and funny also.    I agree that many aspects are pointless.  English is pointless after 5th grade in my opinion.  I think that it should still be there, but just reading books and talking about them.  You shouldn't have to analyze them to death.  No wonder kids hate reading.  You also need to learn to write coherently.  Grammar, however, is the same thing every year.  We get to listen to a bunch of 16-year-olds who don't know what a noun is.  I talked to my English teacher about this, actually, and she said, "I know.  You ask, 'Can anyone give me an example of a verb?" and someone yells, 'Pizza!'"  I thought that was funny.    You need basic algebra, but not all the pull-your-hair-out problems that take up 3 pages.  You only need the really complicated stuff for math-based careers.  I agree that we should learn more practical things also.    What is AVID?  Is that like college prep?  If that's what it is, then that shouldn't be required.  If you already know where you want to go and what you want to do, then you don't need a bunch of career tests asking, "Would you rather build a birdhouse, draw a birdhouse, or write and article about birdhouses?"  That was an actual question.

If his business goes bad and he owes debts, it is up to himself to find the money from somewhere.<br>  <br>  However, other people perform their business through a Limited Company status, where J Bloggs would be a director, but the trading name would be Bloggs Removals LIMITED.   There may be benefits to trading under Limited Company status, for example, if the company goes into liquidation, the directors themselves would not be sought to pay the company's debts, therefore their own assets ie their house/cars would be safe.  I believe there are also benefits regarding VAT, but I don't know the details.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  xx

FmYkUfIDaa	Yes, it is possible, however, I would consider it to be fraught with danger.    It is normal to be friendly with your teacher, and for a teacher to be friendly disposed to all her students, but that is where it should stay.    Just as teachers have to keep a professional distance between themselves and their students, students also have a responsibility to ensure that they maintain a distance too.     It is always dangerous to say anything that might be misconstrued and so it is prudent to keep ones own counsel = don't talk about another individual other than to say something positive about them. The old saying is a useful way to remember this:           "The least said, easiest mended."

Dh0JX2Onaa	Information about ACT study materials is below./|`|27cd00537a4c79f450c26015e47d2f6baa	If your high school offers a free ACT/SAT prep course, take it -- it really does benefit you in the long run.  Also take advantage of your public library -- they usually store testing guides for the ACT in their reference sections.  Peterson's, Kaplan, and other study guides like that some of the best resources to use.  You can also visit the official website (www.actstudent.org) to see if they have practice questions.      Another thing -- if you still have them, take a look at your old geometry, algebra, and trigonometry math notes/formulas.  These are usually the types of questions you'll see on the ACT math section, which in my opinion, usually gives people the most trouble.      I hope this info helps!  Good luck on your test!

Unless of course you score something like a 650 or higher on the GMAT or you have a sparkling resume with unique and impressive work experience.|`|AA10023710	It's not impossible, but it's unlikely. It depends on what academics think of the academic rigour of your undergrad school/program, whether or not the school was regionally accredited, how you did there, what your work experience looks like, and, very importantly, the strength of your GMAT. <br>  <br>  UCLA is actually one of the top 20 MBA programs in the US. The average GMAT of admitted students recently was a 704. You'd want to get around that, if not higher, to have a chance. <br>  <br>  You absolutely must apply to some backup schools as well. But if your GMAT is in the range for UCLA, and your undergrad school is regionally accredited, and your work experience is solid, you should apply. It's worth a shot, but no, I'm not sure you'd get in. <br>  <br>  I don't know where you got your undergrad degree, but places like U of P are not seen as academically rigorous. They are genuine colleges; but not considered strong ones. And that would be an issue.|`|7KcVSB3Uaa	I won't say impossible, but you have almost no chance. Online degrees are not looked on as the equivalent as an on-campus degree in most cases, with the exception of some 1-and-2-year programs. In addition to that, UCLA is *extremely* competitive.

ValLVBcYaa	Some random ideas:<br>  1.Do people have the same sensitivity to smell? Place people at one end of a room. Have another person open a scent, such as lemon oil or vinegar. Have your test subjects write down what they smell and what time they smelled it. Is the time the same for different scents? Does it matter whether the test subject was male or female?<br>  <br>  <br>  2.Does storage temperature affect popcorn popping? Store popcorn in the freezer, refrigerator, at room temperature, and in a heated location. Pop the same amount of each 'sample'. Count how many unpopped kernels remain. Can you explain the results?<br>  <br>  <br>  3.Does food cooked in the microwave cool at the same rate as food cooked in the oven or on the stovetop? Heat foods to the same temperature. Use a thermometer to measure the temperature at set times. Explain your results.<br>  <br>  4.Does the temperature of a magnet affect its magnetic field lines? You can trace the magnetic field lines of a magnet by putting iron filings on a sheet of paper over the magnet.<br>  <br>  <br>  5.? Which toilet tissue is most biodegradable? Take samples of different types of toilet tissue, and soak them until they fall apart. Run the samples through a strainer, and see which sample leaves the most paper undissolved.<br>  <br>  <br>  6.? Does the shape of ice affect melting time? Use the same amount of water, place into different shaped containers and freeze. Then see how much time each piece of ice takes to melt.<br>  <br>  <br>  7.? Which citrus fruit has the most Vitamin C? Make an indicator solution with iodine and starch (it's EASY to do!), and test samples of citrus fruit or juice to see which one has the most vitamin C.<br>  <br>  <br>  8.?

AA10176626	Albert:<br>  <br>  What you are describing is a private business transaction between two independent actors. What you're looking at is a situation that will require either arbitration, mediation or litigation.<br>  <br>  I presume that you have signed a contract with the school, and that the contract includes an agreement, on your part, to pay some particular stated tuition as it becomes due. Obviously, you're not able (and frankly, willing) to do so. <br>  <br>  I also presume that the contract stipulates that - in exchange for paying tuition, the school promises to provide a certain type of education.<br>  <br>  Considered in its simplest possible terms, the school has probably kept up its end of the bargain (providing an education), and you are not able to keep yours. Again, in the simplest sense, you are in default of your contractual agreement, and the contract probably includes language saying what the school can do when you default. <br>  <br>  However, there are always situations where a promisor can be excused from performing his/her agreements. The question is whether or not you can legally void your promise under this particular set of circumstances.<br>  <br>  If this went to court, the judge would consider evidence to support your claim that you reasonably relied on false promises to entice you to enter into the agreement. The judge would consider the facts, and determine whether your evidence is sufficient to support your claim that the statements were made, and that you reasonably relied upon them. I can't predict how that would turn out.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, you can't just refuse to pay, and be done with it. Your school has a written contract (theoretically), and they can (and possibly will) sue you to enforce the contract.<br>  <br>  What I would suggest is that you propose taking this disagreement to mediation. Mediation is a non-binding, voluntary form of alternative dispute resolution, intended to help two parties reach a mutually acceptable solution to the dispute. Mediators are professionally trained - they will listen to both sides, and make suggestions about how the situation could be resolved. Because mediation is non-binding, neither party is required to accept the mediator's recommendation, but the impartiality of a mediator is often helpful in getting the parties' to appreciate each other's perspectives.<br>  <br>  The contract that you signed may specifically state that disputes are to be resolved by arbitration. Arbitration, unlike mediation, is binding. It's a more formal proceeding, and both sides are required to accept the mediator's decision. Arbitration is cheaper than the final option - litigation. If you are sued for defaulting on your contractual agreement (to pay tuition), you'll have to defend against the law suit, or risk a 'default judgment'. If you don't bother to defend yourself, the court must assume that you don't have a defense.<br>  <br>  Depending on the amount of money involved, the lawsuit would either be heard in small claims court, or civil court. You would not be required to hire an attorney for small claims court (you could if you wished), but you'd really be taking a risk not hiring representation if the case is heard in civil court.<br>  <br>  I wish I could tell you that because your situation sounds "reasonable" that you can just ignore the school's demands, but unfortunately, this is a contract dispute, and if you can't resolve it party-to-party, you'll have to engage the services of some sort of dispute resolution process. Your best bet, for informality and low cost would be to propose mediation.<br>  <br>  I hope this information helped you. Please do not consider anything that I have said as legal advice.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|oACh5MWtaa	I know its not the number one choice but you could tell the principle that you have to take your kids out of school because you can't afford it.

Also to me , a doctor should make more than a teacher. Keep in mind that this is my opinion, but I would have to say, from my experience, most teachers (here in NY) are overpaid. This is not to say that an excellent teacher is, but too many teachers are no where near excellent. I know of some teachers making over 80k, we all know how many weeks a year a teacher works. That being said, if I had it to do all over again, I would seriously consider teaching as my vocation. Good luck. Teach well. I hope you make tons of money, but not my tax money...LOL|`|mYhuGonfaa	I don't think it's fair to compare a teacher to a doctor, lawyer, or engineer. The simple truth is that teachers have much less schooling, and the degree they do have is much less rigorous. In the town where I teach, I make as much or more than many other professionals and my earnings are more than comfortable, leaving me with a nice house and everything material that I need. There are places in this country in which a teacher doesn't make an appropriate amount compared to the cost of living. That is what should really be taken into account, the salary vs. the cost of living. 43,000 in one city leaves you in poverty while 43,000 in another city has you living quite comfortably. It's all relative.|`|YyXtxeNGaa	Please don't read the following if your feelings are easily hurt by the truth ...<br>  <br>  Why are Doctors paid more than teachers?  <br>  - Supply and demand.  I would suggest you forego a history course or two and take an economics course.<br>  <br>  Most Medical doctors have IQ approaching or exceeding 140.  That means that roughly only 1 person in 200 have the mental skills to even be qualified to pursue that discipline.<br>  Medical Doctors usually have:<br>  4 years of undergraduate school<br>  4 years of medical school and that is assuming they DO NOT become a specialist<br>  3 to 5 years of residency<br>  Only then do they start to make any real money, most of which goes back to the couple hundred thousand dollars it took in student loans to get that far.  They usually have to join a medical group and are the lowest on the totem pole in terms of pay.<br>  A doctor has to be on duty or on call almost 24/7.<br>  The academic requirements are extreme.<br>  Doctors have to buy or rent their own workspaces.  They have to pay their staff.  They have to purchase their own medical evaluation equipment.<br>  The consequence of a simple mistake can be someone’s life.<br>  Malpractice insurance often consumes 25% or more of their income.<br>  <br>  Teachers, on the other hand, do not need to have extraordinary mental capacity nor do they need to have extraordinary knowledge.  <br>  Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe a teacher can graduate with a 2.0 average and if they pass the teacher's exam they are qualified to teach in a classroom.<br>  The consequence of a history teacher getting a name or a date wrong is not likely to cause great bodily harm possibly resulting in death and lawsuits.   A wrong date or name is not likely to be considered negligence and result in you loosing your teaching certificate, is it?  The classrooms are provided free of charge to teachers as are the electricity, property taxes, water, sewage, repairs, desks, chairs, audio-visual equipment, janitors and secretaries.  Teachers also get retirement, health insurance benefits, and vacation.<br>  Teachers do need patience and the gift of making children want to learn.  They also need to be able to be fulfilled in seeing students progress.<br>  <br>  Teachers, in most cases, do not take courses that are that difficult.  For example, I, as an engineer, took far more math courses than are required for a high school math teacher.  They also were considerably more advanced.  After graduation with a BS I could have taken a few education courses and would have qualified as a teacher.  There is no possible way that an education major can take a few engineering courses and qualify as an engineer.  The discipline is far too rigorous. <br>  <br>  I remember, as an engineering student at N. C. State, on weeknights the only ones who partied (and eventually graduated) were education and liberal arts majors.  Engineering and science majors had to bust our tail because the courses were extremely difficult.  Pre-med students had at least as rough a time of it. <br>  <br>  The fact that you are "baffled" by this revelation might just say something about your understanding of the history of societal pecking order.
YCXxP43Laa	It is probably better to choose subjects that you are best at; and then choose appropriate subjects for A Level.<br>  What you will need is a good grade at Maths and English GCSE, so study as hard as you can for them, and they are compulsory anyway.<br>  I would choose History over Business Studies, as you'll need to have an academic degree (if you do a degree first then do teacher training). Music is an option if you want to teach music. It also depends what age you want to teach... if you want to be a primary school teacher then a good academic degree is all you need before teacher training (Media Studies degree is not acceptable for access to a teacher training course), if you want to teach secondary pupils you will be better off doing a degree in the subject you want to teach i.e. science, maths, history etc.<br>  I would worry less about your options as it is your A Levels and degree that will have more bearing, but obviously if you are interested in science then pick the one you know you will get the best grade in. It is the English and Maths that are the key ones, and then choose your best subjects, as the grades will be important. You can always do GCSEs and A Levels at college as well.|`|UmWfQ6u7aa	GCSEs are irrelevant. Teachers make out they are so essential.

AA11664474	Extremely long hours (up to 16 hours per day)<br>  Inadequate safeguards on machines<br>  Employed children as young as six.  <br>  <br>  That's three.   There's a book called MILL by Robert MacCauley (not sure of last name), that covers four different textile mills and shows the improvements in technology with each and the changes in workforce.  Takes about three hours to read and is fascinating.|`|1ce25e71aa4dd2eb1e82121617a06b87aa	Machines took over back breaking labor.<br>  <br>  I guess people don't get as much exercise anymore, other than that every-ones life is much better|`|YUcl70rbaa	*Negative because the working conditions were very poor and peoples standard of living was not very high.<br>  *Before the Revolution most people lived in small villages, working either in agriculture or as skilled craftsmen. They lived and often worked as a family, doing everything by hand. In fact, three quarters of Britain's population lived in the countryside, and farming was the predominant occupation (Porter). With the advent of industrialization, however, everything changed. The new enclosure laws—which required that all grazing grounds be fenced in at the owner's expense—had left many poor farmers bankrupt and unemployed, and machines capable of huge outputs made small hand weavers redundant. As a result, there were many people who were forced to work at the new factories. This required them to move to towns and cities so that they could be close to their new jobs. It also meant that they made less money for working longer hours. Add to this the higher living expenses due to urbanization, and one can easily see that many families' resources would be extremely stretched. <br>  <br>  As a result, women and children were sent out to work, making up 75% of early workers (Stearns). Families were forced to do this, since they desperately needed money, while factory owners were happy to employ women and children for a number of reasons. First of all, they could be paid very little, and children could be controlled more easily than adults, generally through violent beatings (Sadler). Children also had smaller hands, which were often needed to reach in among the parts of a machine. Furthermore, employers found that children were more malleable, and adapted to the new methods much better than adults did. Children were also sent to work in mines, being small enough to get more coal and ore from the deep and very often unsafe pits (Stearns). They could also be forced to work as long as eighteen hours each day (Sadler). For these reasons, children as young as eight years old were sent to factories—usually those which manufactured textiles—where they became part of a growing and profitable business. <br>  Since workers, especially women and children, were labouring for up to eighteen hours each day, there was very little family contact, and the only time that one was at home was spent sleeping. People also had to share housing with other families, which further contributed to the breakdown of the family unit. As a result, children received very little education, had stunted growth, and were sickly. They also grew up quite maladjusted, having never been taught how to behave properly (Sadler). The living conditions were indeed horrible; working families often lived in slums with little sanitation, and infant mortality skyrocketed. During the early Industrial Revolution, 50% of infants died before the age of two.|`|AaDsQi8daa	1) new automated processes and machines make certain manual laborers obsolete.<br>  2) decline of unions, means the unions that are left have less bargaining power, and ultimately lower wages. <br>  <br>  These are the main ones. You can derive the other 8 from these.
YUcl70rbaa	I would definitely start it by saying what you have done at the job that is considered successful. Talk about how long you have been at the company and goals you have met. For example...<br>  I have been at ABC Company for the past 2 years as a sales rep. In the two years, I have increased sales by 10% in X district. My goal to get 15 additional clients has been met. etc etc etc<br>  <br>  From there, you can get more specific into the raise part. For example..<br>  I now believe I could be further motivated with a raise to my salary. With this raise I could set harder goals to meet and continue to work hard for ABC company. etc etc etc<br>  <br>  Make sense?
quSZLSn1aa	First off, kudos for submitting your work, that takes courage.<br>  <br>  You're comma-happy in your work. <br>  <br>  "the hundred and so names he was known as, had been neatly written on it," could be put as:<br>  <br>  "the hundred or so names he was known as (or by) fit neatly on it."<br>  <br>  Another section is:<br>  "But that didn’t stop him from challenging himself, and after minutes of deep concentration, he made his first decision; he didn’t wish to create only one dream world, he wanted to create several because he had so many ideas in his young, but full of knowledge head, that he couldn’t choose only one and selfishly ignore the others."<br>  <br>  That's a really long sentence; you can afford to break it up a little. Also, "his young, but full of knowledge head" could be "his young but knowledgeable head (or mind) that he couldn't settle for just one."<br>  <br>  I'm using these examples to say that you need to be more concise in your writing. You're using 3 words when 1 will do. Sometimes that's unavoidable, especially in fiction when the reader needs to be informed, but you still need to trim a bit.<br>  <br>  You have some captivating ideas, but the ending is a little...sudden? As the reader, I feel that one of the parables being taught is the danger/responsibility of playing God, but is there a hint to the next step? What is the child/man left to find out?<br>  <br>  Anyway, I hope this criticism was constructive. I like your theme; it's original, entertaining and stimulating. Reduce a word count a little, though.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|x4SRSpVZaa	No|`|uC75y83Taa	It's "realize" not "realise."  Instead of "he'd,"  "he had" or "he would" would look and sound better.  Punctuation comes BEFORE final quotation marks.  Quotations are ", not '.  WhoM we...." not "who."  Whom we refer to as "the child." It's "whom" when followed by a pronoun like "we."<br>  Good job!!  :)|`|vYeS5mYnaa	hi, artifacts is spelled wrong... cool story! good luck
