So, obviously, I choose cheerleaders because I've never been one.      IF YOU ARE A CHEERLEADER OR HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST....   - What do you think are the advantages of being a cheerleader?   - How about disadvantages?   - What are your concerns and hopes?   - What do you do for fun?   - Do you think it's easier finding guys to date because you're a cheerleader?   - Anything else you would like to add?

20090202193515AAIPAnl	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Unislamic family, how to be a better Muslim?	I am a girl around 13 years old, and I am a Muslim. Well...kinda a Muslim. The thing is, my family is Muslim  but they only practice a few things. Like they go to the Mashjid on Friday ( Hardly anymore) We fast in Ramadan, and we don't wear bad clothes. Like mini skirts and tank tops. But we do wear shorts and short sleeves, and most of the girls show their hair. In my family, my Dad, three brothers, and one sister have almost completely abandonded Islam because my parents never taught them the proper things. My mom is the only one who really wants to practice Islam, but the thing is she thinks prayer and hijab are not obligatory when they are. So now I am wanting to become a better Muslim. ( Wear better clothes, stop listening to music, pray 5 times a day, read Quran, those good islamic things.) But it is really hard for me because I WANT to wear the clothes I wear now and I don't want to wear hijab because people will look at me weird. And I WANT to pray five times a day, but no one in my family does. And I can't wear the hijab or wear it properly because my 17 year old brother always brings his friends in the house without permission. So that means I would have to rush and hide everytime they enter my house. And he is stubborn and won't change. And my mother and father won't change either. My mom seems to think that she doesn't have to pray five times a day anymore because she did that in her youth, now it is my turn. But that is not true! And my sister is no help because she doesn't like the idea of no music and wearing full covering clothes. And I WANT to be a better Muslim! I really do! I don't know what to do...! And if I do become a better Muslim..is it a sin for me to stop trying to help my family? Some of my brothers even go to church now. My family has almost completely abandonded Islam... but I don't want to... What should I do? Is it a sin to not try and help my family to practice Islam again? Even though they won't? And I am only thirteen...no one will listen to me.

20090202141545AAO73kA	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do people believe that you can get into heaven based on good deeds?	It says in the bible that Jesus is the ONLY way! You would have to call God a liar for that to happen. Or you would have to say that what Jesus did for all of us on the cross was for nothing! Open your eyes, if you believe there is a heaven, you better believe that there's only one way in and that's through Jesus Christ our Lord. People, you are just trying to make it easy for yourselves. To make excuses to keep on living whatever life you are living and not change a thing. Those who do good deeds also sin. And if you don't know Jesus then who forgives you?

(10 points). im new to this.?	well lately something came across in a conversation my friends and i were having and it revolved around tarot cards.  well this is my question:    what are they?    i mean my friend tried explaining it to me (she doesn't do them or know much about them and i dont think she believes in them aether) but the only things is picked up was that they are cards (obviously) and they are used to predict the future or something like that but yeah, i dont know anything about them and so please write down all u know about tarot cards and also please answer these questions and yes i will be picking best answer for the person that answered my question and did not copy and paste things off the internet (i want answers where people know what they are talking about)    so okay here are my questions:  1. how many are in a deck? is there a limit?  2. how do you read them?  3. do you need some special skills to read them?  4. do you need to call up any demons or anything creepy like that?  5. do you need any specific props in order to be able to read them?  6. do you need to be anything specific to participate and read them? (i mean like do you have to have any believes, experience, or be part of any religion)?  7. is it dangerous?  8. do they even work?  9. do you need to be involved in meditation to read them?  10. do you say anything? is there a way to place the cards? please help and make sure to mention any details i need to know because if i can learn to read them (if im not required to be anything i cant be) id like to give it a try.      thanks in advance!

20090202135442AAEE4pG	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Why are the Wahabis Kings in Saudi Arabia destroying the heritage of Mecca?	In 1998, the grave of Amina bint Wahb, the prophet Mohammed's mother, was bulldozed and doused in gasoline. Irfan Ahmed al-Alawi, who chairs the Islamic Heritage Foundation, said that despite petitions from thousands within the ummah, the Saudis went ahead regardless.      The birthplace of the prophet Mohammed came under threat 50 years ago, when the House of Saud decided to build a library over the site. The architect then persuaded the authorities to allow him to preserve the remains beneath the library. Now the authorities want to concrete over the site and turn it into a car park.      The house of Khadijah, the prophet's first wife, was demolished and replaced with public lavatories. The house of Abu Bakr, the friend of Mohammed and father of AIsha who first compiled the verses of the Koran, was demolished to make way for the Hilton hotel.       http://www.westernresistance.com/blog/ar...

20090202135831AAMKlgM	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;People with Disabilities	What sort of accommodations can my center make for disabled students?	Hi, I work at the Writing Center of my university and we are attempting to make some changes to our office.  One thing we are hoping to achieve is to make our center more accomodating for students who are disabled.  We are accessible for those who rely on wheelchairs; however, we are more concerened with students who are deaf, blind, ect.  In our center students come in with their papers and review them with a tutor by reading the paper out loud and occasionally stopping to discuss the paper.  We do have computers for students to use and we are next to a computer lab.  Could anyone who is familiar with common disabilities recommend programs for our computers and other changes we can make to make our center more student friendly?  Even listing a website of suggested accommodations would be great!  The ones I've thought of so far myself- installing programs on the computer that aid the visually impaired by magnifying the screen or that read the paper out loud.      Any help is appreciated, thank you!

The opposite of evil is knowledge, for the most part.    A racist has not been handed the proper knowledge to understand his racism is wrong.  In order to be "good", one needs knowledge. One doesn't get born with empathy, but nurture and education affects one's vision on life.    Evil is not the absence of good, it's the absence of the knowledge of good.    Knowledge leads to good.

Me: "Hello?"      Reformed, Twice Removed (R2R): "Hello, we're from the Reformed Twice Removed Full Gospel Church of the Risen Lord Jesus... - and we want to tell you some good news!”      Me: “Great, I could use some good news!  What is it?      R2R: “Mankind is naturally going to Hell when they die, because they are not perfect like God is, but God made a way for people to go to Heaven instead!”      Me: (I looked over at a friend behind me who was visiting.  He translated for me):      Richard (my visiting friend): “What they said was, that if you believe what they believe, you will not be tortured in Hell forever.”      Me: “Oh, OK- I wasn’t sure – thanks!”      A cold breeze came through the house as I turned back to the visitors at my door.  The sky was beginning to darken, showing the first signs of night – I shuddered.      Me: "Boy! I don't want to be tortured at all! What is it that I have to believe?!?!"      R2R: "It's really simple. You have to believe that you are unacceptable because this book (The 1611 KJV Bible) says so - and it doesn't matter whether you're good or bad, 'cause A really, really, really big and powerful being invented you - and since you are not as big or as powerful, you are unacceptable.  You are bad because your great, great, great, great, great... Grandparents disobeyed this big, big, being – you see, friend, you inherited their sin!” (smile)   Me: “Wow! Do tell me more about this being!”      R2R: “I’m glad you axed!  This being is composed of three parts and these three parts are one being and one of these beings (the one that is most important to us - became a man - Jesus, like you, over 2,000 years ago and walked on water and turned perfectly good water into an adult beverage, for a party!      This was a mere man, but at the same time, this book says that the "fullness of the Godhead was in him...  So he was inextricably GOD also.  Before Jesus (God), men had to kill animals that had no blemishes on them to atone for their sins, and burn them on an altar, but since Jesus was sinless and perfect, God killed him for a final sacrifice, so that all we had to do from that point on was simply believe!"      Me: “This story is incredible, I must say!  But honestly, I think that I’d rather make animal sacrifices still, than force my brain to believe something so silly!”      R2R: “Wait! There’s more.  You have to turn away from your evil ways - even though you are not judged because you're evil, but by your faith instead.  If you are evil, it means that you have no faith, if you have faith, you will not desire evil - and you have to read this book as much as possible and let it magically transform you, as the third part of God, the Holy Ghost, reveals the truth of it to you.”      Me: “How do you expect me to believe all this stuff?  In fact, why would anyone believe it? Of course no one wants to go to Hell, but am I expected to believe something before I know it to be true?”      R2R: “That’s the beauty of the transforming power of the Holy Spirit!  You first believe, like a child – by faith!  You ask the second part of the threefold God (Jesus) to come into your heart and save you, because you do not want to perish, because you are evil.  If you do this, and really try to believe it – and read this book and pray to God, eventually your belief will become knowledge, and you will come to KNOW that it is true!”      Me: “I’m truly sorry, but I prefer NOT to brainwash myself into believing things just because I may be afraid of an ancient story that says I will go to Hell if I do not.”   R2R: “If you do not believe this book, you will be choosing to go to Hell, where you'll be tortured by the ruler of all evil – Satan - forever!      He will torture you because God will allow him to, like he did Job. Or Maybe the Devil just likes to torture people forever, either way,      If you believe like we do, you get love, peace, healing, every desire fulfilled, streets of gold, mansions, heaven, happiness forever!      But, if you do not believe like we do, you get tortured, you will gnash your teeth, you will be surrounded by flames that never go out, you will be alone, there will be horror, nightmares, and Hell!!!!!

20090202152528AAtXR8d	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Are there any celebrities whose religious beliefs you are very similar too?	Very recently, (last few weeks), I have been more Atheist than ever, but I still remained Agnostic, but I think I'm just not going to go through life trying to convince myself that there's a man in the sky watching over us. I also don't care what others think, especially my family.      So the religious standpoint I share with a celebrity, is closest to Isaac Asimov.      Isaac Asimov (1920 - 1992) was a science-fiction writer and science popularizer who wrote an enormous number of books about a wide variety of subjects, including history, Shakespeare, and the Bible.      [I]f I were not an atheist, I would believe in a God who would choose to save people on the basis of the totality of their lives and not the pattern of their words. I think he would prefer an honest and righteous atheist to a TV preacher whose every word is God, God, God, and whose every deed is foul, foul, foul. -- Isaac Asimov, I. Asimov: A Memoir      I am an atheist, out and out. It took me a long time to say it. I've been an atheist for years and years, but somehow I felt it was intellectually unrespectable to say one was an atheist, because it assumed knowledge that one didn't have. Somehow it was better to say one was a humanist or an agnostic. I finally decided that I'm a creature of emotion as well as of reason. Emotionally I am an atheist. I don't have the evidence to prove that God doesn't exist, but I so strongly suspect he doesn't that I don't want to waste my time. -- Isaac Asimov, in "Free Inquiry", Spring 1982, vol.2 no.2, p. 9      Although the time of death is approaching me, I am not afraid of dying and going to Hell or (what would be considerably worse) going to the popularized version of Heaven. I expect death to be nothingness and, for removing me from all possible fears of death, I am thankful to atheism. --Isaac Asimov, "On Religiosity," Free Inquiry      From  http://www.celebatheists.com/?title=Isaa...       The typical, "I'm Christian just like blah blah blah, won't be anything of interest." But something a bit out of the ordinary would be cool to hear

20090202155325AAgqfQb	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Many Atheists are actually accusing non-Christians other than Christians?	Alright, many Atheists, and even people from other religions, say that Christians are hypocrites and do not practice what they preach. (Please note I said "many Atheists", not "all") But if you know what a Christian actually is, you wouldn't say that Christians really are hypocrites. In fact, saying that they are is completely false.      Let's look at the definition of "Hypocrite"; A person who pretends to be what he or she is not.       So, you could rather say "That person is a hypocrite, because he/she pretends to be a Christian when they aren't."      My point here is, that they're wrongly accused. A Christian is a person who believes in Jesus Christ and follows His ways to the best of their ability - not someone who pretends to be a Christian, but really isn't. That's what you call a hypocrite.       It's a very small but significant observation if you think about it.       What do you think?

20090202153808AAScbyU	Society & Culture;Languages	Could you please translate into Spanish ?	The Samsaric realm of cause and consequence - karma - will determine the direction and results of our actions. If we drink alcohol we may awake the next morning with a headache; if we are recovering alcoholics, we may find ourselves back at the bottle full-time; if we have an extra-marital affair, we may end up in court. If we choose to kill another person, or have an abortion, we will have to live with the inevitable damage to our psyche (it may be conscious or unconscious or both) - and sometimes this damage can be nearly insurmountable to overcome. This is our life and it's our choice how we live it. The precepts are not random and arbitrary, but serve a purpose - to help lift us up out of life's challenges in samsara. A prominent Chan teacher said "It is better to have taken the precepts and to have broken them sometimes, than to not have ever taken them at all.

20090202162548AAwMZwS	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheists: do you ever get annoyed with other atheists for being too nice to religious people?	Have you seen any of the videos that the big guy from Penn and Teller has on Youtube? I liked him on Penn and Teller, I though they did some good work, but I’ve watched a couple of his videos and I find myself very disappointed with him. There was one where he was talking about some Christian coming up to him after a show and giving him a bible and Penn’s description of this was like, “This guy was a really nice guy; not at all like the stereotype of Christian bible bashers…” He kept on going on about how he thought this guy was really a good person all because he gave him a bible.      Sure, religious people can be nice, they have it in them to do good deeds but it’s very rare that a religious person will do something nice for a genuine reason, because they either think they are obligated to be nice by their doctrine or they pretend to be nice in order to advertise their trademarked brand of Jebus-worship. The thing that pisses me off is that why couldn’t Penn see that this was nothing more than a sales pitch? Nothing more than a deluded religious person, pretending to be nice in order to lure someone else into believing the same lies as he does; why couldn’t he see this?

Anyway, I've talked to my parents and the treatment centre and they've agreed for me to be signed in as a day patient which means I go for five days a week from 11-4pm.

I am wondering why some of you who understand god and the bible are beliefs or theories don't step up and tell the many religious folks who believe god and the bible are absolute facts,  that there is a possibility that they are wrong.  I understand that the big bang, creation, the idea that god does or doesn't exist,  are all theories and beliefs,  Why lead people on and let them make foolish statements as those theories or beliefs are absolute fact,  I always tell people that these things are only beliefs or theories.  Because they have not been proved or disproved for absolute fact  Why won't you religious folks who understand this,  Make sure your fellow reigious folks try to understand this as well.          I mean you don't mind telling us who have different beliefs than you, that our beliefs and theories are just that belilefs and theories  and most of us agree.  Are you afraid that telling those religious will somehow lessen their faith?  Do you like to see religious folks mislead? You certainly make sure the rest of us don't get to mislead in our beliefs and theories.  Will some of you please give me a good reason? thank you

20090202163122AAC32RB	Society & Culture;Languages	Was this just a big mistake on the part of the song writer?	I've always found the title of the song "Desperado" to be a tad curious.  The word for "desperate" in Spanish is "desesperado," not "desperado."  So obviously the song title is not (correct) Spanish.  But it doesn't really sound like it comes from any other language.  Did the song writer just goof up, or does this word come from a language other than Spanish?

But over time the english language has changed and certain words mean different things. Just in our lifetimes we've seen certain words kinda change in meaning.   Not just that but also how much of the bible is the opinion of the men who wrote.    I mean I believe in it but the only things I take fully are the 10 commandments and Do unto others.

20090202152744AACwblU	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why aren't Christians doing more to legalize Biblical Marriage?	The Bible defines marriage as a union between 1 man and unlimited women.  The current laws in this country defines Biblical Marriage as "bigamy" and makes it a criminal act.  While King Solomon (according to the Bible, the wisest human being who ever lived) was able to have 300 wives and 700 concubines, modern Christians are unable to even have 2 wives thanks to our anti-Christian government and its "bigamy" laws.      If you think that "polygamy" is not Biblical Marriage, then you should try to find a Bible verse which restricts non-clergy to 1 wife (I'm aware of a verse that says that marriage for clergy is 1 man and 1 woman).  Where in the Bible is the Old Testament law permitting "polygamy" repealed (I've yet to find such a verse)?

I have also seen similar skulls at the natural history museum in London and in New York.   How do you explain these away? Is it a hoax? Did Satan plant them to lead us away from Jesus Christ? Is it persecution? Do you say that because we don't know everything about these skulls then we must know nothing at all?

20090202162447AAIufO8	Society & Culture;Etiquette	If someone's opinion hurts your feelings if they tell you, does that still make it right?	Since people say that everyone is entitled to their right to have their opinion?      I have this religious neighbor who always keeps harassing & nagging me. She's forever knocking on my door & calling me, lying & saying she wants to check up on me & see how I'm doing. She lies, & says that, just so she can trick me into letting her use my computer & press her religion on me, but when I talk, she ignores me in my own house.      I suffer depression, OCD, anxiety, & Tourette's, & she's not understanding or tolerant of my mental disability. Most days I'm too depressed & don't have the energy to get out of bed to get a glass of water or use the bathroom. It's a hard struggle. & she thinks that all I gotta do is ask God. & she says I CHOOSE to be depressed. Well, since she started to try to control me & boss me around, I cut her loose. She got mad told me I look like a homeless person & said I say & do the same things REPEATEDLY, just because she was mad because I was intentionally dodging her. Well, her telling me I look homeless, that made me upset, & we got into an argument, & I went home before I would knock the hell out of her. She called herself trying to lecture me & try to tell me off.      Well, I told my counselor about it, & she tells me all the time that I'm an adult, & that I can do whatever I want, & that I should forget other people's opinions. Well, 1st time, she was understanding towards me about the neighbor's remarks & told me I should stay away from toxic people & toxic relationships.      But this last meeting, we talked about the neighbor stalking me, & she praised me for having the strength to ignore the neighbor not open the door. Then she said, "Have you ever considered the fact that people have a right to their opinion"?      Yes, I understand that people have a right to feel the way they want, but I felt that the counselor was being contradictory, & I felt that she was making it like the neighbor had a right to insult me.       I'm on a fixed income. SSI & Social Security. Most jobs, I'm not able to work, & I get overwhelmed too easily, & being overwhelmed causes panic attacks, which others see as being disruptive. I can't help it.. So I can't afford new clothes.But when the neighbor used to come to my house to use my computer, she would put her dirty socks on my pillow, which was very nasty & disrespectful, & I was afraid to tell her because I didn't want to get arrested over an argument.      But anyway, I asked my 2 friends about the situation, & they said that basically, the counselor was agreeing with the idea of me looking homeless. & I'm glad they were supportive & understanding, & they said that it's not worth paying a counselor every week if I'm going to leave out more angry than I came. My friends also said, "Well, why does your neighbor come knocking on your door & calling you 60 times a day if she has all these complaints about you"? & they said, "She told you all that evil stuff because she was just mad because you were avoiding her, & she KNEW she was trying to take advantage of you!"      My MAIN question is, if someone's opinion is negative, hurtful, & insulting, does that still make it right?      I'm so hurt right now. I thought the counselor was a good one, but me talking to my friend, she said that I lost hope & faith in this counselor. I'm even afraid to go & feel like it's pointless & I'd be stupid & wasting my $$, going to this counselor if she's going to make it like someone has the right to insult me.      Well, with my OCD, I couldn't get this off of my mind for over a week.

20090202160619AAnmBrs	Society & Culture;Holidays;Valentine's Day	Guys:  Would you like this for Valentine's day?  Girls: What do you think?	My boyfriend is one of those guys who will act all tough in front of his friend and like nothing ever gets to him but when I get him alone I've never met more of a caring sweetheart. We've been going out for four months and he is my true love. He's also 21 if that helps any..      Anyways I was wondering how many guys would like this for valentine's day (girls thoughts too?)      He is really into reading, so I'm looking into getting a good book he'll really enjoy, and inside the book place a love note with all the things I love about him. I'm also making him a mix cd and trying to think of something else to include.      For my note I want to start it off something like:      I know, I know, I know.. Valentine's day is yet another exploited commercialized holiday, yet for you, I can't help but participate and join in the celebrating. I want you to know, I love you with all my heart and no one else could ever mean more to me than you do. You are so special in every single way. You make me so happy just to know you're mine. The way you make me laugh, the way you make me smile, the feeling I get staring into your eyes... You drive me absolutely crazy. I can't help but be amazed sometimes that I have you all to myself. You undeniable charm, your great sense of humor, your beautiful brown hair and your smile that leaves me speechless... I can't get enough. I love you so much my darling, I wouldn't trade what we have for the world.

So i meet this guy , lets call him ryan, so the first time i meet up with this guy was at his house, he texted me asking what i was doing and if i wanted to come over, so i said yes. so i got there and he was touchy and nice, so we ended up in his room and we fooling around, and then once things got calm he just fell asleep, and i was just lying on top of him.He then started to snore, and then i rolled over to just let him sleep. As i was starting to fall asleep he rolled over and axidently punched my in the face, so i was like ok its 1 i cant sleep so im going to go, so i got dressed and went to wake him up so that i can tell him im leaving.      and if you think that was bad i left his house quietly to find someone tp'ed my car, i was pissed , i almost went inside to wake him up and be like look at my car!!      anyway long story short he just became a jerk behind you back ( wont talk, wont anything) which i was totally fine with , i figured whatever hes just not that into me and it wasnt ment to be.      SO i figured i would never see him again and one thing lead to another and of course i did, very awkward, he told me how what a awsome guy i am and how cute and just all this stuff, and i was so mad at him and i had so many things i wanted to say and he said hi and i froze, so my question is how do i just get passed him, i mean i like another guy i dont want him to get in the way

20090202152850AAS8Yzg	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why did Jesus need to die?	I've always wondered, why did Jesus need to be crucified and die in order for God to forgive our sins?  Why couldn't God, I don't know, snap His fingers, and just forgive us without all that?  (Or if he could, why didn't He?)      The only answer I've heard is that there is no forgiveness of sins without shedding of blood.  But it's not like there's some necessary connection between the two - God's the one who made up that rule, and He made it for humans.  So if that's the answer, then the next question is: Why did He create that rule, and why did He have to obey it too?      P.S. Not a Christian.  Just honestly curious.

20090202162756AA2rcYy	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Life on Mars... what would it mean for religion?	We now know (fact) that there are emissions of methane gaz on Mars during the red planet's "springtime".      Methane, on Earth, is produced at 90% by life forms (microbes) and at 10% due to geological events, usually active volcanoes. Taking in account that Mars is the geological twin of Earth, but that it is "geologically dead", this bodes quite well for the hypothesis of bacterial life on Mars.      It should be confirmed around 2012 when the next ground-mission will arrive on the planet.      If there is bacterial life on Mars, it would show that Earth isn't the only livable planet in the Solar system.       ***Therefor, what would this mean for religion in general?***            ADDITIONAL QUESTION:      ...Even worse: thanks to the Cassini spacecraft, it is quite likely that one of the moons of Saturn (Enceladus) is covered by a giant ocean, protected by a thick shield of ice... retaining a small atmosphere containing the same elements as the Earth's atmosphere... Everything kept warm thanks to the gravitational forces of this moon been constantly crushed between Saturn and one of the other moons.      Thus, there could also be life there, but under extremely different conditions.      Making life a COMMON thing in the universe.      ***If life is common in the universe, what will happen to religion?***

20090202191404AA7mwRn	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	How can you tell a person's age from their writing style?	From my style of writing, people imagine that I am a child?    How old would you guess I am, from my writing style?    For example:    Your Open QuestionShow me another ?   What is this called? Can anyone relate to this?  hope this doesn't sound too crazy, but I wonder if anyone can relate to this. This sounds weird, but I can't help it.    We all know that some people are transsexual or transgendered. These people are trapped in the body of the wrong gender (or they believe that they are). In other words, someone who is physically a man but feels like they were meant to be a woman... would be considered transgendered. They sometimes go on to have gender reassignment surgery, and go on to have relatively (compared to the past) normal lives. I don't understand it, but I wouldn't judge them either (I have no idea what it's like).    Is it unreasonable to suppose that some people are born with the wrong last name?   Some people simply don't like their last names, but that's not what I'm referring to.   I don't know very many people like me, who have a legal last name that they can't identify with. I felt like I was meant to be named something else. I hate the name Williams, but I don't even think of it as "my" last name. I feel like I got stuck with someone else's name. As a kid in school when I had to sign that name I felt like I was being forced to wear someone else's ugly old shabby sweater.    People say, "you just hate your name." That's like saying that a transsexual hates their gender. I dislike being female a lot, for many reasons, but I know I'm a woman. If I were transsexual, I would be a man trapped in a woman's body.     It's more than I hate the last name Williams. I feel like I'm not a "Williams." I feel like I was supposed to be something else.     Ever since I can remember I've loved latin culture and longed to be a part of that world. I felt out of place in anglo culture... I'm not putting it down. I just didn't belong.   When I found out I had Spanish ancestors I was happy at first but now I feel foolish telling people. Your last name represents your heritage. There's nothing Spanish about Williams, so when I tell people that's my name they think I don't have Spanish blood. It's really annoying because I loved latin culture so much but... I have a name that labels me an outsider.    Is there a name for this? What is this phenomenon called?   People who are trapped in the body of the opposite sex are called transsexual or transgendered... but I've never heard of many people like me, who got the wrong name.     I imagine that a lot of people will think I'm weird, but I wouldn't judge someone as "abnormal" for being transgendered. I have told very few friends about my problem because I imagine people wouldn't understand why I feel the way I feel.    I don't mean to offend anyone but I just feel like my true name should have been something else. I get so sick of having a plain-sounding name, and I hate how my full name sounds together. Generic, like someone pulled it out of a hat. It makes me feel like a nobody. I'm tired of being just another generic girl... I want to feel unique, like an individual. It bothers me a lot.
20090202175453AALVi5L	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do militant atheists have a poor strategy?	I became a Christian largely because the Christians in my life treated me (much, much) better than anyone else, despite the fact I basically ridiculed them. It seems like this is true for a good number of conversions, as far as I have seen anyhow.      If so many conversions are based on the way people treated the person, why do militant atheists think that they can de-convert anyone by belittling, ridiculing, or being generally mean-spirited? Isn't that the opposite of a good strategy? Personally, it seems that the basis of my beliefs would be much more shaken if atheists were nicer or at least equally nice as Christians...but when they continue to be hateful, it just validates my past observations/choices.      What is the logic here? Or is there any?
20090202180910AAfePpI	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Should pro-gay-marriage advocates organize a boycott of dictionaries and other reference materials?	I was just reading my dictionary, and for marriage it says:         the social institution under which a man and woman establish their decision to live as husband and wife by legal commitments;       the legal or religious ceremony that formalizes the decision of a man and woman to live as husband and wife;       the formal declaration or contract by which act a man and a woman join in wedlock.          Obviously Webster must be a bigot. Are gay activists planning a boycott yet? Will it include all reference materials, or just the "tough parts"?

I mean, every day the christians who have all the answers just spit off the bible quotes to answer questions. And they have all the proof that their religion is true because they just know it.

So why aren't there any religious conversions? Is it that the atheists are too dumb to get saved? Do they WANT to burn in Heck? Or do they just not give a crap in light of the fact their godless reasoning has been crush by the heavy weight of biblical quotes?      There are plenty of atheists here but in light of all the facts they still allow themselves to go unsaved.Why?

20090202173325AAKKoRP	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	JW Theological Question?	I was invited to observe the Lord’s Supper  by a JW that came to my door.  I’d never been, was curious, so took him up on his most gracious offer.  Little did I realize that when he said “observe” that’s exactly what he meant, observe.  As far as I could tell, though the bread and liquid of some kind was passed amongst the assembled group, no one partook.  I asked about that and was told that only if one were one of the 144,000 could partake.      As I thought about it later, I wanted to know how one knew if he or she was one of the 144,00, but moved before I had a chance to ask my host.      I still have the question.      Any of you JWs out there who have that answer and would be willing to tell me?      Thanks

20090202131325AA1R8ml	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Am I the only one that doesn't believe in genders?	I am, by definition and biological standards, a female. However, I don't feel female--or male for that matter! I feel like an individual and I feel that gender shouldn't be a big thing in society to get worked up over. Why can't people just be people instead of being looked upon as a "female" or a "male"?      I think it has become obvious in modern society that gender stereotypes are being proved false for both genders so is there really a need for two different classifications? The way I see it is that it is like separating different races of people based on their eye, hair, or skin color. Is there a point?      Also, what is gay, straight, and bisexual? Does it really matter who you're attracted to? If you're a man want to have a baby then hook up with a female but that shouldn't (logically) stop you from receiving/giving pleasure to another man? You're penis doesn't have eyes. All it does is feel. It's like saying that only men can drive trucks because that's who they're meant for. However, a truck doesn't have feelings or emotions. It doesn't care who drives it as long as it's driven and taken care of. And vise verse for women. What's wrong with being with a woman? You both can stimulate each other and your vagina doesn't care what goes in it... okay, that maybe be a little different, but you can still satisfy it without a penis. In fact, science proves that women don't even get off on vaginal sensation (or at least alone) and in fact, it's clitoral stimulation. Does you're clitoris have eyes? It just doesn't make sense to me at all.      Am I the only one that feels like this? Are we really controlled that much by our peers that it chooses who we can/can't/will/won't receive pleasure from?

20090202165014AAAgoR7	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why does everything in America fail>?	I don't know but have you noticed a trend of falled nations.   The trend is this, as morality in a nation decreases then everything else falls with it, ( education, economy, crime rises ).   Now, you guys are all smart people and I think you have noticed this. For example, the Roman Empire fell because it's immorality has perverted the people and if you look at the big picture it made people divided which brought the fall of Rome.     I was just thinking have you noticed a trend in America. When we rejected God and promoted sin and that's when everything started falling apart, which is evident today.  What do you think we should do about it?

Let me ask you if you are not a christian can you still go to heaven?

We do know the truth that those who will be in heaven will only be there because Christ made the way for them.  The truth is by revelation of God and is revealed through the spirit to those who by faith accept the atonement of Jesus Christ and receive revelation through the Holy Spirit"      Now that is a typical answer   Tell me is it absolute fact  Or a belief?  This persons answer seems to think he knows for absolute fact he is correct?      Are there any of you who understand that god the bible are beliefs instead of proven facts.   Won't atleast one of you   please have the guts to tell this guy that he may be misguided? After all god and the bible as you some of you know are beliefs not fact  Iam not saying he is wrong but he is saying he is right?  Can't you tell him that what he believes can be theories.

Isn't it odd how god wanted to give MANKIND a savior, but didn't care about the humans living on isolated continents?      For that matter why did South Americans accept Jesus, but the Japanese did not? Could it be because the Japanese were able to PROTECT THEMSELVES from invading Europeans?      And what about 127 million Japanese today? Why doesn't god save them now? Did god create them just so they could make electronics and reliable cars for Christians? Christians conquered Japan in WWII, and Japanese STILL rejected Christ. How can 127 million people be so advanced, yet be so wrong?      Well, how about it Christians?

I have been looking at getting life insurance for myself for some time  as well as income protection .On the application forms the all ask the same question .Do you have HIV or do you have sex with men .      I say  " No" for HIV and " yes" to the other part  .  I mean I am gay . At the end off the application . It says  due to your response  , at this time we are unable to grant you cover, with out more information .       Why is it that the world hides it's discrimination be hind medical  smoke screen . I mean what more can they ask me about it ?      I mean they don't ask, straight people " Do's your partner stuck his cock up your ***"  they only ask that if your gay. Straight people get HIV/ADS to.      As far as I am concerned this is one big smoke screen to hide the fact that gay people are treated differently . Its just the same as gay people are not aloud to give blood. I mean why? The blood is tested any for HIV and other stuff , why do's it make a differences if my partner is male .

I know you can't answer my question for me but I just find it very difficult to get on with people. I hate people for no reason and isolate myself from large groups and social gatherings as I prefer my own company at all times. Whenever anyone tries to make conversation with me I either shy away or think they are against me which means I fight back verbally. I am so f***ed up! I probably need counselling but do I really need to get along with people?

Well, there are so many stories of God personally speaking to the people and leaving physical evidence of himself.       Where's our burning bushes? Why doesn't God personally reprimand each and every one of us when we do something wrong? Why doesn't God SPEAK to us? (And I'm not talking about that "special" feeling you get when you pray.)      And if you argue that his "speaking" and physical actions were metaphorical, then how can you trust the validity of anything else in the bible?

20090202184603AAWmivr	Society & Culture;Languages	Native Spanish Speakers, please translate?	I speak Spanish pretty good, but I can't yet describe in detail stories. So can someone please translate this for me:    When I was a kid my mom had drug problems so my dad had custody of me, and then when he died I had to live with her. After his death, her drug use just got worse, she didn't have a job, if she wasn't cooking meth then she was sleeping. Thus, I became a very independent child, I walked to school, walked to the laudromat, cooked for myself, etc.  After 2 years, when I was 12, her brothers and sisters realized how bad it was and intervened. They moved us out of the house we were living in, and we moved into my grandma's. There she continued to sleep and make everyone wait on her for a month, until my grandma forced her to get a job. Eventually, she got a job at a grocery store, and saved up enough money to get our own place. Now she has a stable job and is mostly clean of drugs, but she still depends on me to do a lot for her. She wants me to drive her everywhere, I still cook most of the meals, I clean up after her, etc. Also, when she gets mad, she hits me or throws random things and when shes really mad she goes into my room and knocks everything off my dresser. I try to be proud of her accomplishments, but I carry a lot of resentment.

I'm sure this same question has been asked a million times and I'm sorry if people are sick of seeing it.

Kinda like they crap their in their spirits and have to go to God to change their spiritual diapers. As the heavenly father is to weak to teach them how to walk and be real children of God? Why is it you keep crapping in in your spirit with sin Christan's? I thought the bible said adam and eve would have to die, not sin. That means you can be righteous, and still die though. Maybe one day you will not have to ware that diaper Jesus to keep you clean and grow up and be real children of God.

20090202182451AAbgR42	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Can you please imagine this?	Let's say, something happen and we lost our privacy to our thoughts.  We become open and connected to the rest of ourselves. We have this feeling that each of us become the center and that in our mind we become the owner of all the inputs(good and evil) which is  used to be exclusively for individuals only.  We become the murderer, the rapist,  and  war maker. We fear so many things. we become greedy and exploit (unknowingly) ourselves.  Of course, there are good and beautiful but rare transient thoughts of forgiving, loving and sacrifice in some corner of our expanded mind.  If we are in this unthinkable position, what would we do?  Will we finally realize what we have done, that ultimately we hurt only ourselves because there is no one else but you?

20090202191124AAMS6kU	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	13 and wanting to abstain?	Well,   I'm 13 and today a group of students from a local high school came and talked to all middle school students at my school about abstaining from sex before marriage.    I am seriously considering making this promise to myself and to God.   I want to because if you don't have sex, there is no chance of pregnancy or STDs, which in my point of view, would be terrible. I also feel as if it will help me get closer with God, and help me focus on my goals and help me achieve those goals instead of focusing on sex.    I don't know anyone personally who has made this decision, so I was wondering if anyone here has made the decision to abstain.    If you have, why? And if you don't think saving yourself for marriage is the right thing, why?    I really need some opinions because I want to know that what I decide is the right thing.   10 points to best answer.   Thanks!   <3 Alyssa      PS. If you are abstinent(sp?), is it necessary to wear those rings? I will probably talk with my parents soon, but I really just was curious. My friend told me you couldn't make the promise mean anything without a ring. Well thanks! Have a good night.

I posted a question a couple of days ago asking those who were pro choice if they thought there should be a time limit on how far into a pregnancy abortion should be allowed.

20090202201146AAAsIlh	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Im going to make a vow not to use my Ipod in public for at least a couple of weeks, how can I go through on it?	First, I'm tired of listening to the same songs over, and over, and over, for the past year. But, that's not the reason I want to stop using it. I feel like I'm socially disconnecting myself from the world. I used to never wear an Ipod on my 1 1/2 hour bus trip to college, but when I saw alot of people using it, I went with the flow. Everyday as soon as I leave the door to get to my first bus stop, I put the ear bud in my ear, press play, and keep myself isolated from the world for the remainder of my morning commute. It's not like I will talk to anyone on the bus anyway (In LA the bus occupants are odd, to say the least) so maybe the iPod would be a good sign to others that I don't want to talk, but I can't handle it anymore. Sure I'm an introverted guy, but I feel like my iPod is sucking the life out of me. So, my question is: How do I commit to not using my iPod in public and do you feel the same about this?

My bestest buddy in the whole world is so caught up over this FU(KHEAD guy. From what I can see, he totally led my friend, lets call him Adam.. on - as in, hook up originally like once a week, have Adam stay the night. Then it got to the stage of picking it up when it suited him, focking him in the back of his SUV and the driving him home.    It seems this guy is so far in the closet he needs a good dusting off. Both of them are buff tough masc dudes. But its obvious this pr!ck thinks hes gods gift. He hasnt been straight with Adam about anything. Not even his age. (I found his real age via a google search)       I told Adam and I know he was upset. I felt so bad when I had him told, but anyway. The guy started contacting Adam less and less. Didnt return his calls, didnt return his texts, unless Adam said something like "You callin over?" he'd get a text back "You call over here." It was so obvious he was all about the sex. But he made Adam feel bad. Saying Adam wasn't putting the effort in (Not true.) and telling him he could "get *** anything he wanted". Which naturally upset Adam.       Anyway, just before xmas, he met him by mistake and he wanted to hook up with adam. But Adam blew him off, even though it broke his heart. He didnt wanna be a booty call.       He hasnt heard from him since and he is really upset. He thinks he loves this guy, and he wont let me go confront this guy. I could seriously kill him for hurting my best friend. I am really angry and Adam knows how I feel, so I try keep my opinion to myself cause I dont wanna make him feel like he has to bottle it all up.       Anyway, he told me yesterday that he felt so sad, he would "end it all" if he wasnt such a "pus5y" and it completely knocked me for 6.    Its breaking my heart seeing him hurt so much and nothing I can say or do is making it better.       Have you any ideas on what I could do? Remember deballing the pr!ck is not an option.

20090202201942AAqtZGy	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Are there any places that offer the choice of having a gay/bisexual counselor/therapist?	I know this is really long, but PLEASE read till the end, I need help/advice.      The past couple months I've been having some HUGE problems that have led me to being suicidal/depressed/missing school and the only way that the cops and my guidance office will leave me alone is if I am going to therapy.      I myself was never really one to believe in therapy and I still think I don't, but I would appreciate someone to talk to who I could connect with and feel like could actually help.      So far, I have only seen two different people. The first woman was probably in her early 60's and was basically a stuck up pumpkin with a stick in her butt. She didn't give me a chance to talk before she called my mother in, and I am aware that as I am only 16, my parents still legally have control over me, but my point is...that just didn't work.      The guy I am going to see now...I am EXTREMELY uncomfortable with. He seems like he himself has a few unsafe mental disorders that he isn't taking pills for [honestly, I'm not trying to be an ***]. He is kind of bipolar/unpredictable, and he also seems like he has tourettes (sp?). He flails his arms wildly when talking and he must be in his 40s-50s...his pants are usually falling down, and not to offend anyone [SERIOUSLY--I'm not trying to be mean] he seems a bit retarded.      Obviously, he is a certified counselor and all, but I do not feel comfortable with him either, and am only going to him so that my school/cops will get off my back.      Now on to my main question...a lot of my problem has to do with me being bisexual and a few complicated relationships and things. I feel like I would be WAY more comfortable talking to someone younger and gay or bisexual...and a straight, mentally disordered or superiority-complexed OLDER person is not going to be able to understand/relate to/give me any useful advice for my problem.      Are there any places that offer counselors like that for kids like me? Just to clear up any confusion...I am absolutely NOT looking for some kind of therapy to turn me straight. People are getting mad at me that this depression of mine keeps going on and on and on, and that I'm not trying hard enough to talk to the 'professionals,' but how can I when they are like this?      Thank you for reading my insanely long question and if any more details are needed, I'll provide them as SOON as you ask... [not in a reply to you, but in the extra details section, cause I get mailed when I get new answers].      Please and thank you :\

I just watched sev vids on utube where ppl wore 2 leg braces, struggled to make it up stairs & thought it was funny.       Similar vids covered other disabilities wherein the videographer 'played' with the braces or items disabled ppl use to function in daily life.       These vids not only make fun of legitimately disabled ppl, they also have some misinformed ppl thinking: disabled ppl are 'faking it' or that their disability is 'not that bad' & 'they could do something physical if they really wanted to' .       I stumbled onto these vids by accident. It was appalling these ppl were so disrespectful. Ppl like this are furthering stereotypes which so many ppl have battled to obtain respect, access to svcs, & mere recognition as fellow human beings.      Ppl w/disabilities endure so many challenges. What are some effective ways to counteract the ignorance spread by prejudice, discrimination, etc.?

This is a follow-up to my previous question, which, according to most arguments ultimately hinges on locality.  If consciousness existed in the brain, say, then we could keep a person in a sensory deprivation tank, wait until they were 18, pop them out and expect them to understand themselves, since consciousness is found in the brain.  If consciousness is something that is instead ACQUIRED by the brain, through development and learning, then it could be argued that consciousness is external to the brain and is obtained by interaction with the environment.

So as you know, like 80% of everyone is a Christian down here. More than that in my small town, but anyway.. I've been raised in a church. The past year or so, I've been struggling with this. I believe in higher power, and I know there has to be a God, but this whole Jesus thing? Nuh uh. I just don't believe in the bible. I know how it came along and its just like any other religious writings. It mainly depends on how you are brought up. If your raised in a Hindu environment, your going to Hindu. Same with people down here. Most of the people around here say they are Christians, but all of them cuss, smoke, drink, and then go to church on Sunday. I can ask them why they believe in Jesus, and they'll say something like "because the bible says he's real". Ha. Maybe people a couple thousand years later will be worshiping the books Harry Potter, and  KNOW its all real just because the book says so. WTF? Then if you don't believe in Jesus, you are such a bad person and are going to hell. I'm fine with Christians. All my friends are Christians, I don't care what religion you are.. But anyway, typed a little too much there. LOL. Back to the question. What is your religion, and why is it your religion, and how do you know its true?

20090202194524AA1UAsX	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, what is the purpose of free will if fate has already been sealed?	Often, people ask why can't God reveal himself and prove he exists and put an end to doubt. People answer- free will. Then, these same people, will at times tell us about the end of days and the new kingdom on Earth which will be only for the faithful and ruled by Christ. This then goes against the free will, does it not? If it is a kingdom ruled by Christ and blah blah blah, does anyone have free will and if so can they exercise it after the end of days and in the new kingdom? To me, it seems like a paradox- that you have free will and that is why God doesn't prove himself to us and yet God will prove himself to us at some point in the future and then rule us on a new Earth and in a new kingdom where there is no question he exists.       So, what is the point of free will now without God present that will be changed when his new kingdom is created and he is present? If you can answer that logically, perhaps you can answer why God hasn't just made it apparent to all doubters that he does exist without question. If free will is the only answer, then the argument will continue to go in circles without ever explaining the point of free will when his new kingdom is created. Perhaps he will take away our free will? That is about the only way anyone could explain it away.

20090202135258AAQbJ0T	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Should polydactylism be considered a race, since Judaism is?	I see a lot of misconceptions as to whether Judaism is a race (news flash: it's a religion).        Now before you go flying off the handle, let me explain a few things:      - Having similar genetic traits does NOT really prove anything.   - Anyone can convert to Judaism should they choose to.   - There are Jewish people of all races/backgrounds in existence.   - Someone whose mother is Jewish is considered Jewish according to *JEWISH LAW* - If they give up their belief -- They are an apostate.      But by lieu of the "scientific" arguments that people tried to place:  We should also be labeling rare genetic disorders that follow a specific haplotype as races as well...      Polydactylism, progeria and hypertrichosis would be subject to definition as a "race" under this logic.       So, should we consider these genetic diseases/disorders/haplotypes as a race?

They will send me to one of those exorcism camps because i am gay... and i already figure i must be going to hell, if its there. ;~; it's just i love her, and i'm willing to give up all i have... even if she has to give up nothing but i'm still a minor! i'm still in school! i was hysterical because the whole town (and surrounding areas) know about my cutting (which was because of my being gay/lesbien/biseuxal... whatever i like girls u get it) and don't just tell me to leave or break up with her because its too late. Yes i can upset her even more and make her afraid to lose me but what do i do now??????????? WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO ME? I can't keep denying forever and I don't want to but I'll be out on the streets!

I'm 100% Chinese (we have books with family history and stuff) and I think I look "Chinese".        I have dark brown hair, brown eyes, and tan skin.

A friend of mine is in the middle of a sh*tstorm = severe health problems for a couple of months, potential blindness, financial crisis, and you-name-it.    Her "neighbor", during this time, has called the cops on her numerous times, reporting her dog running loose, which was a complete lie, as her dog was kennelled the entire time. Finally, during her latest convalescence, the neighbor called again (dog was in the house the entire time), and now she has had to give up her dog.   Also, the neighbor has reported her vehicle for blight, which equals not moving it for 48 hours (tough to do when you're laid up).   She is not a vindictive person, but went to talk to them today, and in spite of the fact that she was simply requesting that they give her some peace, they told her they would continue to report her every time she 'broke the law'.   She's thinking about laying a few fish under their shrubberies come spring - any other delightful ideas?   It's got to be easy and nearly free, annoying but not illegal or damaging to property.

20090202203541AAde7FO	Society & Culture;Languages	Could you please correct any grammar mistakes written in English?	    Dear Mrs. xx      Yujin told me that she can’t change her current schedule regarding on the matter of PE8.   Please understand why I am telling this:      The reason Yujin did not really want to take PE8 course on 1st term was because she was told PE is much harder than in Korea.  She wanted to take some time and to be ready in her mind for the class.  I thought there would be no problem even if she can take PE8 on 2nd term.  When we visited your office, you kindly helped out with Yujin’s schedule to get rid of her PE8 on the 1st term schedule and replaced computer course after all.      However, I realized that I misunderstood about PE8.   First of all, I thought she can complete PE8 by taking it in either the 1st term or the 2nd term twice week such as Fine Arts8 Yujin took in her 1st term.  By the time Yujin gets her 2nd term schedule, I got to understand about Academic course searching on the Internet.  I also realized Yujin will probably complete PE8 by attending twice week in both 1st term and 2nd term according to the information I had got.      That’s why, one day, I said to you Yujin has to take PE8 four times a week in 2nd term so that she won’t have any trouble when she is in Gr 9.  As you may remember, you agreed with this and Yujin has finally got the current schedule.      However, the reason I asked Yujin to visit your office on Monday is because I found a schedule received on Sep 23, 08 from the office. I thought Yujin might be able to take half PE8 when she is in Gr.9 because term 3[=2nd term] says that she can take PE8 twice a week as shown below.      I am sorry for Yujin because she told me that she will probably be the only student taking PE8 four times a week and attend PE8 class Mon through Fri.  It was my big mistake that I did not fully understand about this required academic course, PE8 when we were working on the schedule.       I just wish she could take half PE8 when she is in Gr.9 while she take PE8 twice a week on the 2nd term in Gr.8.  I always care for Yujin. I just want her to be happy whether at home or at school. I wish she were as tough as local girls.  I should’ve asked about PE8 enough so that Yujin would get a schedule that she can satisfy.  It was my mistake…      Regards,

Hes going through depression and i just found out he gets beaten by his mom and his dad left him 2 years ago. Well turns out dad just returned today becuz his mom called him to take him out of her life temporarily for a month or so. So he was basically abandoned by his mom. All this makes me think he might consider suicide again. What should I do? I dont want to tear up his family either.

20090202204835AAqD8do	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	The need to remain celibate?	I am not a religious individual, but I would describe myself as "spiritually philosophical", if that makes any sense. For my own internal reasons that cannot be translated into words, I feel the strong need to remain celibate and to immerse myself with seeking out the deepest kind of knowledge. I am 19-years-old, in college, and have never been intimate, had a boyfriend, or felt the need for one. While I have had simple "interests" and flirtation was involved, I was always the one to back off in the end or hurt the person unintentionally with my blunt words. Whenever I try to get to know someone on a deeply personal level, I feel that it's wrong and too time consuming for me; as if it's not meant to be, or it's not the right path for me. I am currently speaking to someone I really do like, but my whole need to remain a loner always creeps up and takes over. What is the best way to remain with a person being the way that I am, or, in your personal opinion, would you simply remain on your own path without any person intervening? My problem is that I am very neutral with everything, and often do not involve any kind of emotion in my decision-making process. How can I tell this guy that I no longer wish to speak to him without hurting him? I am trying to include his emotions as well.

20090202141703AA10pGm	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	For all them Christians..?	I am not trying to offend any of you with these questions or the points i am trying to make..      My first question is, Why is it that the Bible is written by a few writers e.g. Mark, Matthew.. but none of them have met Jesus Christ himself; but these people have written their version of the Bible 40-80 years after Jesus Christ was crucified?      My second question is, If you believe Jesus is the son of God or God, why did he not say that he was, but is has been said by Matthew, Mark etc that he is the son of God even though they wasn't around at time of Jesus Christ, and if he was the son of God, why would he pray to his father?       Also, if Jesus died for the sins of the whole world, if that is the principle, although Jesus did not say that he died for that reason, somebody else said it, If he died for the sins of the whole world, there wouldn't be no judgment for those people..         Why is that the bible is being changed, theres a old testament, new testament etc, if you Christians want to follow your religion, why don't you read the original bible which is locked up in Vatican, hidden from all eyes and if you look at that bible compared to the bible today, you will a see a big difference..      All views welcome, please no hate comments.. it's just a few points i want to discuss with you

They say don't let others tell you what to do (pressure you to smoke weed), yet the commercials are propagating their viewers to not do something? And no, in no way am I supporting the use of marijuana, I just think it's ironic.       There's a whole subculture in America trying to get weed legalized and these commercials are just the kind of promotion we don't need.   I also think that the weed commercials are ridiculous, alcohol, meth and cocaine are far more superior drugs that rarely make an appearance in the Above the Influence commercials. No one to my knowledge has overdosed on weed like you can with alcohol and other drugs. In MOST cases it's harmless.      So why not focus on more severe and effecting narcotics like alcohol, cocaine, or meth?

20090202143607AAt4pmQ	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Please read-How do you feel about kids being spoiled in this circumstance?	I think its ridiculous when kids whos parents make around 200,000 give or take 100,000, drive bmws, and all of that. But my question is, if a kids parents are millionares, i mean up there, 10's of millions, is it wrong for his parents to spoil him? If they have money to the extent where they do not know what to do with it, is it really WRONG for them to buy their kid a nice lexus, or mercedes instead of a used 2002 honda. I'm just saying, is there a cut-off between spoiled, and blessed? I'm not talking about those sweet 16 sort of kids now either, i'm talking down to earth kids, with smart, wealthy parents.

20090202151643AAVTxHm	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you believe it or not?	"Data from the Pew Center, the National Opinion Research Center (NORC), and the Harris Poll now show that America is entering into the same process of secularization that previously occurred in other Western countries."      A truly secular United States may be just around the corner.  The change from a generally theistic to an atheistic society took less than half a century in Europe and the US seems to be following suit.      Can you believe it....?
