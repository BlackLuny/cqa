You can perform a smoking rendition of the latest pop song, but it may not be well received by the cowboys at the local honky tonk bar.<br>  <br>  Research the places you plan to sing, see what others are doing and what is considered the norm for that particular venue. Even that isn't enough sometimes as it is ultimatly the particular crowd there that night that can determine the vibe. Try having a couple songs in your vocal range from various genres up your sleeve to start (classic rock, country, pop, ect.) - this will give you some adaptability to get seen and meet people in the particular circles you're singing at.<br>  <br>  As far as what to sing - try googling the top requested lists from club and wedding Dj's to find out most requested songs - these are crowd pleasers that everyone knows the words to, the audience likes participation. There's plenty of places on the inter-web to find free downloadable Karaoke tracks to practice to. Guitar tab sites are full of 3 chord guitar songs easy to sing and play if your doubting your ability to back yourself - or look at how other people play popular songs on You Tube. <br>  If your still not confident about backing yourself with a guitar, learn to sing "bar standard" songs that any competant open mic host will be able to back you on.<br>  <br>  The more you do it - the easier it gets.

Ariel's gas station work earns them just enough for food, but keeping their situation a secret from the county welfare people is a job in itself. Mary Belle runs the household sternly, refusing charity from even her good friend Amarius and his niece Dearly. But when Callie falls ill with measles, Mary Belle must finally ask for help. She is rightfully hardened and bitter, though her narrative occasionally sounds wise beyond her years. Callie's spirited naivete helps add sparkle to this emotion- filled and depressing tale. Disappointingly, Mary Belle's final redemption evokes neither triumph nor joy, but readers will appreciate her discovery that what constitutes a family has not much to do with genetics and everything to do with love"|`|jdah4ZA2aa	Oddly enough, I think my mother was telling me about this story a few months ago.

hktbfRPWaa	For a school/college descriptive paragraph it's fine, but for a story I'd say you could probably cut out a few words. People want to know what's happening in the story and, while they do want a picture of what is going on, they don't need to know every little detail. For a description of what someone looks like it's fine, but I wouldn't carry on with so much detail throughout the whole story, just for key points (main characters and settings)<br>  <br>  "This is just for my fan fiction on fanfiction.net<br>  <br>  And no, I'm not using this much detail for all of my writing, it's just for a description of her, as she's the main character."<br>  <br>  With fanfiction people should know the character already. If they don't description is good. But if they do you certainly don't need that much description at all. People read the fanfics they know about so they know the characters already, allowing you to write about them without having to try and build up a character from the start|`|cciB0SmBaa	Jaz,<br>  <br>  Meg M is right.

Aqua blue eyes glistened in the light as they stared back at me. They were set into a face that was curved into a diamond shape in the likeness of an elf. My eyes told the story of age and, staring into them, I could finally see that they were too old for my face. <br>  <br>  Oh, how the synthesis of ‘Cynthia’ was combined; and, I for one, was shocked.<br>  <br>  See how it flows better?

I can only speak from my own experience.  Time has healed some wounds, sure.  Others don't hurt as much, but are definitely still there.  I don't know if that means it depends on the nature of the wound or if it's just that some take longer to heal than others--well, I know that's definitely the case.  I guess I'm saying I don't know if some wounds never heal or if enough time just hasn't passed for the ones I'm thinking of to heal completely.

It can make them bearable after time some bad time in life may forever leave a wound but at the same time, people who go through something dramatic can grow stronger because of that... emotionally stronger people, more compassionate toward others and to not quit even if they know that time can't heal every wound... but to continue life anyhow in the best possible way by taking advantage of all the help that is available, plus one learns to know who ones friends are in times of trouble, one understands we are not perfect people, not many people manage to go trough life untouched by witnessing some kind of injustice and pain, those who manage to do must be living sheltered behind a glass dome, I don't know if that is the better life...they never lived at all, so maybe it's better to live with some wounds that never completely heal, and become a more mature and understanding person because of it.. and also less judmental against other people's fallibility and fears and vulnerablity.. and by helping others, sometimes, that can help to lessen ones own pain, by sharing that of another.. then maybe somebody else will help share ours... that makes it easier... it makes things more bearable...|`|KOctm8uKaa	We just get better at hiding our pain from the people around us as time passes.

Or it could be a print of one of Thomas Gainsborough's works. Both artist painted the same neo-classical style during the same time period.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Several reasons why I know it's a reproduction: First, original oil paintings are never encased in glass, not glass that presses up against the painting. This print is obviously encased in a glassed in frame. Second, original oil paintings show texture and brush strokes. While reproductions can show the cracks in aged paint a print can not show real texture. Texture becomes flat and washed out in a reproduction.

DiRI58buaa	Divine Command Theory: An act is morally right if and only if God commands (wills, desires, etc) that act be performed.<br>  <br>  God commands "Thou shalt not kill", so killing is morally wrong.<br>  <br>  The Euthyphro problem is great for showing why it is very seldom used by professional philosophers.<br>  <br>  I just thought I'd add that to the other excellent answer.|`|AA10729675	I am impressed by the answers and I have nothing to add.  Everything is said, and well said.|`|1e4622c41080edcef755ae0f3f517e48aa	Divine command theory suggests that the ONLY thing that makes something moral or not is that the gods say so.<br>  <br>  It's important to note that if there is some kind of rule that the gods use to determine what is good or not, then we're not talking about divine command theory any more.  This theory puts the gods on top of ethical decisionmaking and absolutely nothing else above them.<br>  <br>  Though it seems to occur in some religions, it's not usually a very popular ethical standard because it seems arbitrary and limited to most folk.

B3FBgxjEaa	A British intelligence report from August 1945 states: <br>  <br>  When the Germans proposed to put their anti-Jewish measures into force, no protest whatsoever was raised by any of the Guernsey officials and they hastened to give the Germans every assistance. By contrast , when it was proposed to take steps against the Freemasons, of which there are many in Guernsey, the Bailiff [Alexander Coutanche ] made considerable protests and did everything possible to protect the Masons.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Transport list <br>   <br>  The remaining Jews on the Channel Islands were deported in February of 1943 sent to internment camps in France and Germany. Of course while the authorities in the Channel Islands helped the Germans deport the Jews, they had no certain idea on what their fate would be. <br>  <br>  It was clear however that no matter what their inevitable fate, their persecution under the Germans would most certainly be "unpleasant", yet they did nothing to prevent the deportations.<br>  <br>  The Normandy landings in 1944 heralded the final phase of the of the islands' German occupation. By August St Malo surrendered and the islands' supply routes were cut off. <br>  <br>  For the next eight months, the local population and the 28,000-strong German garrison went close to starvation. Liberation finally came when an Allied task force headed by HMS Bulldog arrived off St Peter Port, Guernsey on 8 May, 1945. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/nazioccupation/channelislands.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/...</a>|`|gGZz2EGyaa	During the Second World War, the islands were the only part of the British Commonwealth occupied by Germany. The German occupation 1940–1945 was harsh, with some island residents being taken for slave labour on the continent; native Jews sent to concentration camps; partisan resistance and retribution; accusations of collaboration; and slave labour (primarily Russians and eastern Europeans) being brought to the islands to build fortifications. The Royal Navy blockaded the islands from time to time, particularly following the liberation of mainland Normandy in 1944. Intense negotiations resulted in some Red Cross humanitarian aid, but there was considerable hunger and privation during the five years of German occupation, particularly in the final months when the population was close to starvation. The German troops on the islands surrendered only a few days after the final surrender in mainland Europe.<br>  <br>  It does not say in the web site that I looked at if any jews were killed on the Channel Islands, it just says that they went to concentration camps.  I have put the web site below if you wish to have a look further.  Hope you find what you are looking for.

wEEOvu5Waa	A vampire is a creature damned by God, thus when the sunlight (I suppose symbolic to the "good" or holy side) touches them, they burn. They are forced into shadows, the "bad" or evil side.<br>  <br>  At least, that is how I portray it. You reject the gift of a mortal life God has given you, and cross over to the damned lingering life that the Devil can offer.<br>  <br>  So, if Edward sparkles in the sunlight, and becomes just radiantly beautiful, does that mean that God has not damned them to the cold shadows? Light could represent God as it is warm and good, so if he sparkles in the light, it is almost like God has blessed the vampire rather than damning it.<br>  <br>  In Twilight, I don't see the vampires being condemned to Hell at all. Even though a part of Edward does not want her to hell when she eventually 'dies', the way the story is written and the way her vampires are portrayed, I don't see them going to hell at all. Her writing is so "sunshine, daisies and true love," that the notion of sending poor 'sweet' and beautiful Bella to hell does not make sense.<br>  <br>  But anyway. <br>  I believe the reason he did not want to turn her at first is because she seemed to willing to give up her human side, and was not aware of exactly what she would be leaving behind. The other vampires did not have a choice, they were made to a vampire to avoid death. So I am sure that they long for their once human lives, and know how much Bella should be treasuring it, rather than readily throwing it away.<br>  <br>  Don't mention the whole "maybe God blessed the vampires," bit to your church though. They might throw Holy Water at you.|`|hl4kkvXhaa	Immortals don't go to hell.  They're damned...but merely to an eternity of life on Earth.<br>  <br>  As for the reasoning...it's pure marketability.  Stephanie Meyers might be my favorite writer (by a long shot), but she actually made a good move here.  As long as Bella remains human, Meyers can keep churning out mediocre story after mediocre story.  If she makes her a vampire, the series would have to end because there would be no more internal conflict for Edward.  That's all.  There's no character reasoning...only human monetary reasoning.|`|sEMVoJccaa	you make a good point but from what i remember reading early in new moon was because Edward didn't want Bella to lose her sole or something along that train of thought|`|RKAyiYLSaa	Cant say it would spoil the books keep reading and then ask her (?)|`|mEqgRSlhaa	Wow....... he didn't turn Bella into a vampire because he didn't want her to go to hell? Wow.....<br>  <br>  <br>  Wow.....<br>  <br>  <br>  Wow.... *in awe*<br>  Please, that's the stupidest thing I have ever heard in my life, no wait, the second stupidest thing, Twilight was the first.  I'm sorry.<br>  <br>  In Twilight they never mentioned that vampires are condemned to go to hell, that certain detail was not mentioned nor indicated; I believe it is incorrect.  As to the reason why Edward didn't want to turn Bella into a vampire, I suppose it's because she wasn't aware of what she will lose; becoming a vampire means she would lose her mortality, therefore she'd probably see her father, mother and friends die one by one... even for a vampire that would hurt her.  That's the reason in my opinion. :)|`|vmCn7E8Xaa	the reason why edward didn't want to turn bella into a vampire is because edward believes that when you get turned into one you lose your soul and he didn't want bella to lose hers and because he believes that once your a vampire you have no soul then there would be no life after if they die like heaven or hell because they have no soul.<br>  im a twilight addict too :)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AkKifNbPGY3CjXRUg95UUT_sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304092423AAvNG1r">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|y499zJUzaa	i think that might be the reason. but the other reason is because he doesnt want her to give up so much for him. especially how she cant live a normal life, and will be loseing her mom,and dad. he doesnt want her to go through the bloodsucking type life.and since its really hard for a vampire not to like blood, it will be hard for her to control it.so he doesnt want her to become a killer. or something=/.|`|LkLK25dEaa	well edward mentions the reason many times in the book..he says that he has no soul and that he doesn't want bella to lose hers..he also says that if there is a heaven and hell , he already has his pass to hell because of all the things he has done..while bella still has a shot to get into heaven...|`|hSHlL7Zxaa	particially because he doesn't want her to go to hell, but she said anywhere without you is hell, but he also doesnt' believe that vampires don't have souls, and he doesn't want to destroy Bella's|`|zpGccg1caa	Edward didn't turn Bella into a vampire because Stephenie Meyer wasn't finished making her millions off of twits like you!|`|B44nuNU2aa	reasons :cuz he didnt want her to go to hell   and feel no pain  +he didnt want her to lose her soul|`|qAGeCYVlaa	If vampires are immortal then obviously they're not going to hell...|`|Q5Ou3AJYaa	It's because he wants her to keep her soul and he thinks that by turning her into a vampire she will have no soul like him.

I have read all of the twilight books and seen the movie and I have read the first 12 chapters of Midnight sun. So here is your answer. He won't change Bella because he believes that carlisle is wrong and that you lose your soul when you are changed. He also doesn't want her to miss out on all of her important human milestones either. The other problem is he wants her to not suffer. He feels that to change her when she doesn't need it to live would be taking from her. Taking her chance to be a mother, her chance to do all the things you cna do human and not do as a vampire. Keep reading sweetie. You will figure it all out and you will love how it turns out. Enjoy!!! Hope this helps.|`|OXSOch9Oaa	I was under the impression, that it was because he didn't want her to go to hell and he wants her to live a normal life, having babies, growing old etc.  Keep reading though!|`|Nd6uItCDaa	well that is the reason mentioned in the book... xD<br>  and also he doesn't want to stop her life, he wants her to have a normal life hence why...well 'new moon' will explain.<br>  Can I just remind you there are tonnes of great books out there so please don't exclude them just because you found twilight.<br>  Twilight is only what's hot right now because of it's publicity.<br>  <br>  Try reading some of these: <br>  Percy Jackson and the Olympians by Rick Riordan<br>  Airhead by Meg Cabot<br>  Eragon by Christopher Paolini<br>  House of Night by P.C.

eebe66a3a4bd4b0bbf8c0da45b2f62abaa	The US Consolidated its hold on the continent during this time.  Once that was completed, by the end of the 19th century, the US used the Monroe doctrine (and the Great White Fleet) as an excuse to continue to expand beyond that into the western hemisphere territories held by Spain.  This made the US a global power, and a real player in WWI.  But, at the end of WWI, the US had reversed the expansionist attitude and sought to create a global authority (The League of Nations) which was a failure.  another World War and an other initiative (The UN) would be needed to make that happen.

They believed in devils and that people could be possessed by devils. <br>  <br>  Ghosts were dead people come back to haunt the living, for ill, so also to be feared. e.g. Banquo's ghost in Shakespeare's MacBeth.

OhWmu0R3aa	Not at all.<br>  <br>  The first answer points out the definition of revolution but neglects to emphasize the term "THOROUGH replacement of an established government" which would involve the colonists sailing to Britain, overthrowing the Westminster parliament and replacing it with themselves; something they had neither the desire or capability to do. That would have been a genuine revolution. <br>  <br>  As it is, it's far better to call it a War of Independence, or even the Second English Civil War considering that the colonists considered themselves such. Benjamin Franklin stated that " to be an England-man was, of itself, a character of some respect" but he lamented that his non-colonial cousins did not regard them as fellow Britons as if they were "unworthy of the name of Englishmen, and fit only to be snubbed". John Adams expressed the same feeling of inferiority at his sense that those born in Britain did not see him as a fellow Englishman. "We won't be their Negroes", he snarled, writing as Humphrey Ploughjogger in the Boston Gazette. "I say we are handsome English folks, and so should be as free".<br>  <br>  In terms of bringing change, not that much altered for the average colonist. Ironically, the taxes that stirred up so much trouble (at least in the eyes of the wealthy smugglers) were raised five times above that which was levied by Britain and still the wealthy families were in charge. Just no longer with a king. <br>  The claim that America was the first secular democracy is wrong on both counts. The country with greatest amount of democratic freedom was that which the colonists had saught seperation from - Britain. They obviously thought so too considering that 90% of the US Constitution is a direct lift from the English Bill of Rights (1689) and Act of Succession (1701). For over a century the British monarch had no real say in the running of government and religion had certainly been kept well out of the whole business since the religious dictatorship of Oliver Cromwell during Englands flirt with republicanism.<br>  Also the word "democracy" is from the classical Greek dēmokratiā  (dēmos = people) which gives an idea who first practised it.<br>  <br>  The only other country that the War of Independence affected was, of course, France. The majority of the rest of Europe adopted a parliamentary system when absolute monarchies were abandoned, even though some leaders held the title president.|`|t7KHxE2Iaa	Absolutely. The word 'revolution', by the way, is also defined as "an overthrow or repudiation and the thorough replacement of an established government or political system by the people governed." Which, is of course accurate given that we rejected a monarchy in favor of a democracy. The first secular democracy in the world, in fact. <br>  <br>  The infant United States was an experiment in Enlightenment and humanist values which had never before been attempted. Many of the world's experts at the time were certain it would fail, including Edward Gibbons, historian and author of "The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire".<br>  <br>  Funny anecdote: Ben Franklin called on Gibbons while he was in France, hoping to dine with the famous author, whom Franklin greatly respected. Gibbons refused the invitation. He thought Franklin and the rest of the colonists were nothing more than rebels who would quickly be put down by the British government. Franklin wrote him to back and said that due to his (Franklin's) actions, Gibbons' next book would be entitled "The Decline and Fall of the British Empire".<br>  <br>  The Revolutionary War was a huge influence on the rest of human history, particularly in Europe. It inspired the French Revolution as well as changes in existing political systems.<br>  <br>  Moriarty - the English government after the Magna Carta was representative in name only. The legislature had no real power over the king, as Tom Paine eloquently pointed out in Common Sense. It could not truly be called a democracy. No government which claims a king with a 'divine right' to rule as its leader could be.|`|a7758985bc328f86aea63a86e0cd5cfdaa	Absolutely.<br>  Beginning of the end of colonialism.<br>  The first time a nation was built on the proposition of freedom,equality & self determination ,without foreign rule or opression.<br>  Still a work in progress.<br>  All in the history books.<br>  Just noticed...2 Absolutelys' get the picture.<br>  Best regards

The first genius invented fire, another invented the spear. These technological breakthroughs kept happening, until one day some genius invented the printing press. in all this time populations were getting bigger and geniuses were becoming a smaller and smaller minority. With the printing press, this allowed for a technological and educational boom which allowed humanity to make so many things. However in this ability to grant advances to those who cannot make them themselves it has led to abuses. We have coal plants in China, car fumes, massive electrical usage. We are now dependent on the technologies which drive our society. Turning them off is hard...

qpTeX8jqaa	There's a wide range of elements to classify it as "fantasy".  It's also worth noting that there are numerous sub categories to fantasy.  For example there is sword and sorcerer fantasy, and there is whimsical fantasy.<br>  Wikipedia has a good layout of fantasy, it's sub classes, and general info on it.<br>    Mostly, fantasy need only have a situation, event, or characters that have "fantastic" qualities, in that they are supernatural or beyond a scope of normalcy.  Things like magic, special creatures that talk or do things impossible in real life, time travel, or monsters all fall into fantastic description.  <br>    Lord of the Rings is a typical example of sword and sorcery, while Wind in the Willows is an example of Whimsical.  so you don't necessarily need swords and wizards, nor do you need talking animals, to define fantasy, but those are the kinds of elements that can make up the genre.|`|AHuBqplbaa	Fantasy involves surreal worlds, or surreal twists to the real world.  It could be filled with orcs and dwarfs and wizards like Lord of the Rings, or it could be a tale from the viewpoint of  rabbits, like Watership Down.
cGbxP589aa	Try this food for thought.<br>  <br>  (Example)<br>  <br>  Does evil even exist? Are we just a product of our environment? If one is raised to be a Sadist and perform Sadist activities in the name of god, idea, or belief... How can that be evil? How could that child, who turned into an adult, know any better? Sure it may be horrendous in the eyes of others. But would you, me or anyone else would have been the wiser if thrown into the child's position? The same could be said for the 'good' as well. Same Principal. Think about it before you hastily reply.<br>  <br>  ( I could go into more detail, but I'll just wait to see if there is any interest in my comment before I dedicate time to it.)|`|4Ka4Mqo5aa	Firstly, we must define what is meant by evil before we say that it exists.  Moreover to say that it originated from something implies that it is outside of ourselves.  Also, the question implies that evil originates suggesting that it once may not have existed, when you could argue that if indeed evil exists and having established what it actually is it might simply always have been there and so does not need a point of origin.|`|OBtqhybJaa	It depends on how you look at it. If you look at it from a religious outlook it could be some form of a demon or some other unearthly life form.<br>  If your looking at it from a more scientific aspect its just human emotion and desire. As humans we all have emotion that change our outlook depending on the emotion if we are happy life can seem good if we are angry life could seem bad, but evil has a lot of different definitions so in the end you must look inside yourself and find your own answer|`|2KFf4iXcaa	Evil has roots in Free Will.<br>  <br>  Evil is a construct of sentient beings. It isn't present in nature, animals do the things that they do because they have to survive and have survival instincts. If they have to kill to eat then its simply survival.<br>  <br>  Humanity though is sentient. While yes we kill to eat that is simply a primitive instinct to go eat food. Fair enough we could eat vegetables but then again some people cannot. <br>  <br>  Sentient beings who have ambitions or desires which breach there own sense of conscience conduct Evil. Remove sentient beings from the universe and then evil does not exist. Other life with is not sentient doesn't do evil as it is only doing the things it instinctly knows. Even if that instinct is to kill its own babies or to kill another for the position of alpha male.<br>  <br>  Then again what is evil? what is morality for that matter. It is a human concept which is defined by humans. Nowhere does it say that killing people is bad, except in religion. However if a person of sound mind was to draw the veil of ignorance over themselves (imagining that you are of no sex, race or nationality) and think of things that they want in life then certain things do emerge like Freedom of speech and security.<br>  <br>  Evil is what most people believe it to be, and Evil is performed by sentient beings.|`|Pt7UlHzEaa	It originated in Heaven. <br>  <br>  Lucifer if believe was his name. He tried to conquer the Throne of God in Heaven and the first sin committed was "Vanity". <br>  <br>  When it comes to us as humans, it's in the nature of a human to live in sin and to therefore be evil. However our Souls make the ultimate decision. <br>  <br>  So choose wisely my friend.|`|es9jaXWXaa	well evil originated from the devil but original sin originated from adam and eve who were tricked by the devil who again is evil so yea|`|BjyXKFpRaa	from with in a person|`|FoIxsunVaa	Zoroaster taught that there were two forces, the lie and the truth, good and evil, light and darkness. These forces are EQUAL and Ahura Mazda (Zoroaster's god) created both to COMPLIMENT EACH OTHER. In other words nobody ever wins. This is the basis for the concept of free will.<br>  <br>  This belief was widely accepted in Babylon when the Jewish people went into captivity there. When they left, they brought dualism with them. if you read sections of the Old testament (as the Christians call the Torah and other ancient writings.) sections like the book of Job do not have the "Great Satan" but a devil who visits heaven and whom God takes suggestions from. Only AFTER the Babylonian influence does the devil become evil incarnate.<br>  <br>  So evil is a Babylonian/Persian concept that has warped western views for centuries.|`|bdcecff4c5d24df3f626e75937f26e3baa	From religious fanatics...There, I said it!|`|y8bFwXZEaa	"Since reason is man’s basic means of survival, that which is proper to the life of a rational being is the good; that which negates, opposes or destroys it is the evil."

And his basic vice, the source of all his evils, is that nameless act which all of you practice, but struggle never to admit: the act of blanking out, the willful suspension of one’s consciousness, the refusal to think—not blindness, but the refusal to see; not ignorance, but the refusal to know.

HkXYGAOdaa	The speaker is a narrator of the fable; the speaker TELLS wise fables, which apply in real life.<br>  <br>  The tone of the poem is very clearly stated in the last stanza: if one builds up walls and acts aggressive so one can feel safe, then one can expect aggression back in return.  Poor snake!  He didn't deserve to die.  He was just in his home, his territory, and his civilized hiss to warn the peasant of his existence unfortunately made the peasant to be proactively aggressive to kill him.  That pretty much sums up how the people in our society react from the CEO of the wealthiest company to the mail worker.  Everyone acts aggressive so they won't be prey to the 'bully'; thus get aggression back in return.

0741081782691c4bf15f3f43c93552d6aa	In the early 19th century scientists took note of a visual phenomenon: A sequence of individual still pictures, when set in motion, can give the illusion of movement. These scientists attributed this experience to what they called persistence of vision, whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of a second after the source has been removed. The eye’s retention of a visual image, now known as positive afterimage, has long been considered a founding principle of motion pictures, even though its relationship to the perception of motion is still not well understood. <br>  <br>  <br>  The persistence of vision concept stimulated experimentation with motion-picture devices throughout the 19th century. Among the first such devices was a slotted disk with a sequence of drawings around its perimeter. When a person spun the disk in front of a mirror and looked through the slots, the drawings appeared to move. The zoetrope, a device developed in the 1830s, was a hollow drum with a strip of pictures around its inner surface. When spun, it produced the same effect. In the 1870s French inventor émile Reynaud improved on this idea by placing mirrors at the center of the drum. A few years later he developed a projecting version, using a reflector and a lens to enlarge the moving images. In 1892 he began holding public screenings in Paris at his Théatre Optique, with hundreds of drawings on a reel that he wound through his apparatus to construct moving images that continued for 15 minutes. <br>  <br>  Inventors began to conceive of combining the principles of these moving-image devices with the photographic recording of actual movement soon after the development of still photography in the 1830s. The most famous experiment occurred in the 1870s in California, where railroad tycoon Leland Stanford hired British photographer Eadweard Muybridge to settle a bet on whether a galloping horse ever had all four feet off the ground. Muybridge set up 12 cameras along a racetrack and spread threads across the track with a contact to each camera’s shutter. Moving along the track, the horse broke the threads and caused a sequence of photographs to be taken. The photos showed the horse with all four feet off the ground, and Muybridge went on a lecture tour showing his photographs on a moving-image device he called the zoopraxiscope.|`|y5DAfNtHaa	it depends on the genre of the movie..|`|aWzw8b2Jaa	For ENTERTAINMENT<br>  <br>  and some cases PROPAGANDA!!!! during WW2 for instance<br>  <br>  plus, in those days, some documentaries or news broadcast can only be seen in the theaters as a "SPECIAL REPORT" like in ww2 (if you wanted to know what was happening all over the world, in the special report)<br>  <br>  cuz... back in those days, people would rather socialize with their friends at the movies (like these days too) rather than slouch down at home listening to the radio or boring TV...<br>  <br>  They would rather watch movies which were, INFORMATIVE, ENTERTAINING, and UPDATED and COOL|`|UBvhTWnaaa	during world war 1 when most of the men were in europe women needed entainment and that allready started dancing clubs and someone was smart e nuff to make stories and then movies

iLrqYrJQaa	Well, let me start as this... I use to be a pessimist, use to view everything in a pessimistic view... You know, always thought the worse and expected it. <br>  <br>  I believe in possibilities. You choose what you believe, not your parents, friends, or anyone else... That's pretty obvious, im sure. All the things you are questioning are all possibilities. Its just like god. I don't believe he exists but I believe it is possible. Anything is possible, you should be open to that but its your choice. <br>  <br>  In life, you have options, you make them, not anybody else. You have an option for everything, believe it or not. Nobody makes the decisions for you, or they shouldn't at the least... Even your parents, they are not going to decide on the choices you make.<br>  <br>  In today's society, its not even close to reality. Today's society isn't reality. Everybody has a different view of "reality". The way I view it... Today's society like I said isn't even close to reality. "Gangsters", Celebrities, Politics, So called heroes in today's terms... They all look for fame and/or respect... Gangsters don't deserve respect, Celebrities don't deserve fame and wealth, Politicians don't deserve jobs, today's heroes don't deserve fame. In today's society Heroes and Celebrities have been confused with each other... Stupid trends such as, obnoxious bass levels, fast cars, pants sagging, feeding lies to America and its citizens has really ripped this country apart... I have to say im ashamed to live in such a country where our government has so much power they think they have the right to take away the way people live in other countries, freedom is ridiculously against our constitution.<br>  <br>  Is there really a right and wrong or morals? Its possible... It depends on what you believe I suppose.<br>  <br>  Is reality and life itself a hallucination some delusion? Its another possibility, even I, have thought about the same thing.<br>  <br>  Is there life after death? How is it death if its life? In other words, I don't believe there is but its possible.|`|wR8yViaVaa	The ultimate question is... how many roads must a man walk down?|`|AA11564934	morals are subjective<br>  life and reality are real<br>  death is the end|`|26DoxkOBaa	I believe there is karma that keeps the universe in order, so you can call that a type of moral order. To me God is the only Reality and life is an illusion. When people die they go to a higher plane of illusion, review their past life, and if it was mostly positive you can say you were in heaven and vice versa, and then you reincarnate because you didn't realize your real Self, which is God.|`|obKSk23aaa	I believe Genesis 1:1 - "In the beginning God. . ."; and follow that all the way down to what I'll be having for breakfast tomorrow is real. Therefore, my opinion is everything has a purpose, all of our decisions matter either minutely or immensely; and what we call good and evil, right and wrong are profoundly significant to use personally and to the universe at large - just as the vast expanse of the universe is composed, influenced and maintained by vastly infinitesimal particles; the vastly infinitesimal thoughts, feelings and actions of a single human being can influence reality like a peddle thrown in a still lake. And this life, in this physical dimension, is only the beginning of ultimate reality.<br>  <br>  Now, if I am wrong and there is no god, then there is nothing - life, right, wrong, death, all of existence is but superficial constructs of particle interactions occurring in organic gray matter - which in itself is nothing. There is no meaning, purpose or reason to anything; and no consequence to action or inaction. There is no evolution, no truth or order.<br>  <br>  Either or is fine with me (^_^).|`|scyLaz0saa	There is a right and a wrong however with today's relativistic world it is hard to figure that line.  There are morals however most do not follow them.<br>  Life and reality is the tangible.  It is not a delusion is a place for learning and growth.<br>  There is life after death.   We came from somewhere and we are going back to that place.  We are on a revolutionary circle until we have learned all we need to and can move onward.|`|AA12025213	Don't worry, you are not alone. I used to think of this every night until I decided I did not care.<br>  <br>  If you want a straight answer to all of these question, pick a religion, there's dozens. They will answer it for you in what I'm sure is a very unique way. That's what religion is for.<br>  <br>  3 things<br>  <br>  To explain the as of yet unexplainable<br>  To give a set of morals to guide your life by<br>  To give a sense of comfort through having faith in something<br>  <br>  Personally, religion is not for me. I am not atheist, catholic, agnostic..etc. Those all require you to commit to a belief and that I cannot do. No, me, I accept the fact that I won't know until the end, and I try to get everything and experience everything that I can in life. Otherwise what's the point?|`|AA10788698	Nothing is absolute. Everything is relative and is forever changing. <br>  <br>  Just my opinion...
AwhrUGxHaa	Without physically seeing it and handling it, it would be very difficult to determine its exact value (which is imprecise anyway).  I would go find an appraiser to give you a value.  Many auction houses have them, and they can give you an estimate usually based on the current market demand for them.<br>  <br>  A less precise way would be to see what they sell for on websites like Alibris or eBay.  Be aware of conditions though.  Based on the information that you gave there and without knowing the condition of the pages, I would venture that your book could probably be labeled "Good."<br>  <br>  Cheers!<br>  <br>  ?2009 SinisterMatt.

0MZTh034aa	May god help you coz i am just 15!
draNVjbkaa	Yes, it will. The Selmer C* is one of the standard "Classical saxophone mouthpieces" and is designed to fit all saxophones.<br>  <br>  As a user of both Yamaha and Selmer, I highly suggest that you look at the Rousseau Mouthpieces. Classical Saxophone master Eugene Rousseau designed those mouthpieces and uses all of the Yamaha saxophones. I felt because of that, the Eugene Rousseau mouthpieces work best with Yamaha.<br>  <br>  I also love the Vandoren V5's, notably size A20. They give a dark classical sound. <br>  <br>  The problem with the C*s is they can come off as bright sounding. The main reason why some players that use them have dark sounds is because they use Vandoren Traditional 5's and thin the tip so the thick heart is still intact and actually playable, thus producing a dark sound a la Harvey Pittel.
IRFLk4T1aa	This is very easy to do it yourself. <br>  <br>  First, jot down as many adjectives about yourself as possible that you know already. Then, after that, look in a thesaurus or on an online thesaurus to find correct synonyms for the words. Remember, after you choose a synonym, look up the word to make sure you are using it correctly. If possible, look for synonyms that start with each letter in your name. For example, you would find one beginning with N, then O, and so on and so forth. You get it now. I hope I helped.

nAYqN4xBaa	The Taiping Rebellion took place around the same time and also in China. It was less of a full-out revolt and more like one insane man fighting the government. I believe it took place shortly after the British began gaining influence in China, and those leading the rebellion were bothered by the outsiders. Might be interesting to compare the two in your paper.|`|QxxSSKVQaa	Filipino Rebellion
agwxFmITaa	Well a sonnet has 14 lines organised like this.  It's a love poem - how an ordinary boy changes when the girl he loves comes into the picture.

8c8ca69ba60952337e6a67121fe756c9aa	The first is the better poem (Terra cotta memories is an excellent line, recalls spring and summer, but humanizes, brings back dirty hands, working in the garden, tending....) but the second contains hope....<br>  <br>  Winter has been just killing me lately, so today I choose the first, but I don't want to.|`|dS3XHvaoaa	If I have to choose one, it will be the first one... <br>  <br>  "Terra cotta memories" <br>  <br>  Very oriental... <br>  <br>  Why don't you leave it for a few days? Then, come back to it and see if you can combine both of them... <br>  <br>  That will be nice... Two opposing ideas on a single poem...|`|S9bEtVCSaa	I like the first.

AA11657414	according to the Geneva Convention, Enemy Combatants, ie people with guns and bombs and not in uniform, may be executed on the spot.<br>  <br>  The Gitmo combatants are living better than they ever had, especially when you consider they could have been shot on the spot.....and the worst treatment they suffered was having dogs bark at them, or interrogations that were less than Demi Moore went through filming GI Jane......<br>  <br>  and our people, like the civilian WSJ reporter Daniel Pearlstien, have their heads sawn off , slowly, by dull knives while the  whole thing is videotaped and sent out as a recruiting tool.|`|8747ad5946dec06c50e2f01268404c87aa	the only difference btwn the Gitmo and a real prison, if you believe the press, was the prisoners were beaten by the guards and not other prisoners.|`|9233401496ab10d52d1644174696a803aa	I think the jury will always be out on that one. The truth on how American prisoners will never be known unless it is state sponsored by a state who keeps good records like the Germans did. The US who keeps good records are presently destroying those records as the CIA admitted yesterday. One would have to get prisoners in equal confinement with similar stories that could be matched and verified.|`|tB5HkmWwaa	When you say American prisoners do you mean a normal convict or a Prisoner of War?<br>  <br>  AQ or the Taliban don't take prisoners.

shVgCizBaa	Many critics feel that the Yalta Conference did not do enough to ensure world peace following World War II. Why do so many people blame Roosevelt for the failure? My opinion is that Roosevelt was terminally ill and Soviets had more leverage.They had three times more troops in Europe.Allies did not want another war despite the possession of the atomic bomb.Stalin was the winner short term .Longer term Russia lost .Eastern European countries have little trust  or friendship for Russia.They joined NATO with Baltic states recently .Even Ukraine.Georgia wanted to join NATO. -------------------  Roosevelt met Stalin's price, hoping the USSR could be dealt with via the United Nations. Later, many Americans considered the agreements of the Yalta Conference were a "sellout", encouraging Soviet expansion of influence to Japan and Asia, and because Stalin eventually violated the agreements in forming the Soviet bloc. Furthermore the Soviets had agreed to join the United Nations, given the secret understanding of a voting formula with a veto power for permanent members of the Security Council, thus ensuring that each country could block unwanted decisions.<br>  <br>  At the time the Red Army had occupied and held much of Eastern Europe with military three times greater than Allied forces in the West.<br>  <br>  It is possible that Roosevelt's failing health was partially to blame for poor judgments. Lord Moran, Winston Churchill's physician, commented on Roosevelt's ill health: "He is a very sick man. He has all the symptoms of hardening of the arteries of the brain in an advanced stage, so that I give him only a few months to live".[3] Roosevelt's companions, however, have never admitted to this theory and perceived him perfectly capable of dealing with Stalin. Roosevelt died of a cerebral hemorrhage two months later.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yalta_Conference" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yalta_Confe...</a>            Western betrayal or Yalta betrayal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Betrayal" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Bet...</a> are popular terms in many Central European countries, especially in Poland and the Czech Republic which refers to the foreign policy of several Western countries which violated allied pacts and agreements during the period from the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 through World War II and to the Cold War, as rooted in hypocrisy and betrayal.[1]<br>  <br>  The "betrayal" refers to the fact that the western Allies—in spite of having promoted democracy and self-determination, signing pacts and forming military alliances prior and during World War II—nonetheless betrayed their Central European allies by abandoning these pacts. For example by not preventing Nazi Germany from invading and occupying Czechoslovakia (Munich Betrayal) or abandoning its Polish ally during 1939 Polish September Campaign[2] and 1944 Warsaw Uprising.[3] Western powers also signed the Yalta agreement and after the World War II did nothing or very little to prevent these states from falling under the influence and control of Soviet communism. In addition, during the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, Hungary neither received military nor moral support from the Western powers during the uprising which was eventually violently suppressed by the Soviet Army.[4] The same scenario was repeated in 1968 when communist armies of Warsaw Pact nations led by the Soviet Army invaded Czechoslovakia to crush the Prague Spring changes in the governing Communist system.<br>  <br>  As far as Yalta Conference is concerned, the concept is disputed by those historians who argue that Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Winston Churchill and President of the United States Franklin Roosevelt had no option but to accept the demands of their ally Soviet premier Joseph Stalin in Tehran and later in Yalta. However, there is certainty that there were some misjudgments of the power of the Soviet Union by elements within the Western powers, much like the case with Nazi Germany a decade before. Supporters of Yalta are sometimes outraged at the notion that Yalta was a "betrayal" of Eastern and Central Europe without considering the fate of Poland. Polish forces had fought the Nazis longer than any country since the beginning of the Second World War, they fought alongside the U.S., British and Soviet in every major campaign in Europe[5] including the final battle of Berlin, with the strength of the Polish Armed Forces in the West peaking at 249,000, 180,000 in the East and over 300,000 in underground[6] AK[7][8] In the final stage of war the Polish troops on all the European fronts, excluding the Home Army, amounted to some 600,000 soldiers[9] (infantry, armored troops, aircraft and navy). This made the Polish Armed Forces the fourth largest after the Soviet Union, United States and British Armed Forces.[10] The Polish government in exile was an official ally of the U.S. and Britain. All this did not prevent Roosevelt from acquiescing in the dismantlement of this Allied government and its replacement with a puppet communist government. Even as the men of the Polish 1st Armoure|`|NtFWoBHsaa	Here is a link that goes into your question :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=N_G-wELa3xYC&pg=RA1-PA105&lpg=RA1-PA105&dq=yalta+conference/roosevelt&source=bl&ots=XT-qEMfup-&sig=gTDo4ehKokxNrKMsOYhJ8NYtD9c&hl=en&ei=nqauSYO5EIOftwfIo6WKBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=6&ct=result" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.com/books?id=N_G-wEL...</a>|`|ZmdIlkpQaa	Ultimately, the people who blame Roosevelt are unrealistic or are revisionists.<br>  <br>  Unless the US (which was fighting a major war against Japan, as well) and the UK (which was clearly nearly exhausted from its long war against the Germans) wanted to fight another major war in Europe against the Soviet Union, they had to accept that the Soviets had the dominant influence in the areas taken and occupied by Soviet military.  The text of the Yalta conference agreements were clear in that Roosevelt and Churchill expected Stalin to allow free elections in Eastern Europe, and would allow a unity government to be created in Poland which would combine the Communist Provisional Government with the expatriot "Free Polish Government" which had been operating in exile in Britain.  That Stalin refused to adhere to those agreements, and decieved Roosevelt can hardly be laid at Roosevelt's feet.  See below, most especially the second link.|`|1hvrQYWiaa	The big problem at Yalta was Roosevelt - Churchill had very little influence on him by then. This was because Roosevelt saw USA as having made the greatest contribution to victory over the Nazis (highly debateable), and because he felt that Britain was so exhausted by the war that it wouldn't be capable of playing the role of a major world power  post war (correct)<br>   So, he wanted to make all the major decisions on the western Allied side, and there wasn't much Churchill could do about it.Additionally, Roosevelt felt he could 'handle' Stalin easily, and so took the lead in discussions with him. How grossly wrong he was is shown by his reaction to Stalin's 'list'. When discussing war crimes trials,  Stalin said it would be better just to take out those responsible and shoot them, and that he had a list of those marked for summary execution.The list had 50,000 names on (including almost the entire upper officer section of the German army). Roosevelt thought Stalin was joking, but didn't realize that a man who had killed more of his own people during the war than the Germans had wouldn't blink at the execution of 50,000 Germans.<br>   Roosevelt made many concessions to Stalin at Yalta because he believed the promises Stalin made in return - of course, Stalin was lying,but this didn't become clear till after the war, when Roosevelt was dead.<br>   So, the blame definitely lies with Roosvelt - he was overconfident, and ignored Chuchill (who was in a weak position) who warned him about Stalin.
HQb7EKTsaa	Yes I think you should get a copy that has both the Italian and the English. For that, I would recommend Allen Mandelbaum's under Bantam Classics if I am not musch mistaken.<br>  <br>  The reason: did you know that Dante deviced his own rhyme scheme, called the terzerima, just to fit in with the prevalence of the number 3 in his work (3 being the number of the Trinity)? The beauty of this form is often lost in translation. That's unavoidable.<br>  <br>  One English translation that tries (and with success too) to keep this beauty is the one by John Ciardi. Although, as a little pay off, he has to rephrase some lines every now and then. He informs you if he did so in the footnotes. He is quite a poetic translator and I personally prefer his version over Mandelbaum's.

It takes time to completely absorb and appreciate all the small successes Dante has in The Divine Comedy, so if you are to read it for a class, make sure you have it in hand about three to four weeks ahead of time to give yourself plenty of time to read and re-read sections, especially if this is for an advanced or Master's-level course where severe annotation, expounding or analysis is required.|`|pbw7chpyaa	Do you speak a Romance language?

9233401496ab10d52d1644174696a803aa	From the history the main goal was to cut traveling time. Te immediate goal was US imperialism as they controlled it giving Panama an annual rent. Today it is used for its initial purpose of improving traveling time. <br>  The history of the Panama Canal goes back to 16th century. After realizing the riches of Peru, Ecuador, and Asia, and counting the time it took the gold to reach the ports of Spain, it was suggested c.1524 to Charles V, that by cutting out a piece of land somewhere in Panama, the trips would be made shorter and the risk of taking the treasures through the isthmus would justify such an enterprise. A survey of the isthmus was ordered and subsequently a working plan for a canal was drawn up in 1529. The wars in Europe and the thirsts for the control of kingdoms in the Mediterranean Sea simply put the project on permanent hold.<br>  <br>  In 1534 a Spanish official suggested a canal route close to that of the now present canal. Later, several other plans for a canal were suggested, but no action was taken. The Spanish government subsequently abandoned its interest in the canal.<br>  <br>  In the early 19th century the books of the German scientist Alexander von Humboldt revived interest in the project, and in 1819 the Spanish government formally authorized the construction of a canal and the creation of a company to build it. The discovery of gold in California in 1848 and the rush of would-be miners stimulated Americas interest in digging the canal<br>  <br>  Various surveys were made between 1850 and 1875 showed that only two routes were practical, the one across Panama and another across Nicaragua. In 1876 an international company was organized; two years later it obtained a concession from the Colombian government to dig a canal across the isthmus. The international company failed, and in 1880 a French company was organized by Ferdinand Marie de Lesseps, the builder of the Suez Canal.<br>  <br>  In 1879, de Lesseps proposed a sea level canal through Panama. With the success he had with the construction of the Suez Canal in Egypt just ten years earlier, de Lesseps was confident he would complete the water circle around the world.<br>  <br>  Time and mileage would be dramatically reduced when traveling from the Atlantic to the Pacific ocean or vice versa. For example, it would save a total of 18,000 miles on a trip from New York to San Francisco.<br>  <br>  Although de Lesseps was not an engineer, he was appointed chairman for the construction of the Panama Canal. Upon taking charge, he organized an International Congress to discuss several schemes for constructing a ship canal. De Lesseps opted for a sea-level canal based on the construction of the Suez Canal. He believed that if a sea-level canal worked when constructing the Suez Canal, it must work for the Panama Canal.<br>  <br>  In 1899 the US Congress created an Isthmian Canal Commission to examine the possibilities of a Central American canal and to recommend a route. The commission first decided on a route through Nicaragua, but later reversed its decision. The Lesseps company offered its assets to the United States at a price of $40 million. The United States and the new state of Panama signed the Hay-Bunau-Varilla treaty, by which the United States guaranteed the independence of Panama and secured a perpetual lease on a 10-mile strip for the canal. Panama was to be compensated by an initial payment of $10 million and an annuity of $250,000, beginning in 1913. This strip is now known as the Canal Zone.|`|0741081782691c4bf15f3f43c93552d6aa	I'm assuming that because the United States was involved it was automatically considered Imperialism.

SO, not C.<br>  <br>  Is it B? it seems obvious that the focus of the psychological novel is the thoughts, obsessions and emotions of the main characters, not the type of lives they lead.  So, not B.<br>  <br>  Is it A? you may not know what naturalistic means (of course you could easily look it up).  It means sort of super-realism.  But even without knowing that, there isn;t a meaning of "natural" that would mean "beyond the level of everyday life."  So, not A.<br>  <br>  That leaves D.  While D does not mean romantic in quite the way you might think (kissing and hugging and yearnings related to kissing and hugging) even that meaning is one in which you are more likely to find "heroes and heroines" and grand stories, which are elevated beyond the level of everyday life.  Think of a movie with soaring music behind it.

z54ESUIOaa	A literary device is a certain technique used in writings to make it sound more impressive. Examples would be:<br>  <br>  1) Simile - comparing A to B (e.g.: his shouts were like thunder)<br>  2) Oxymoron - a pair of antonyms in a sentence (e.g.: look at the poor, rich girl)<br>  3) Hyperbole - exaggeration (e.g.: Dad was so angry that steam was coming out from his ears)<br>  <br>  Hope that helped!
AA11209233	That's a decent plot, you can definitely make a story out of it.  <br>  <br>  Be sure there are limits to any superpowers--the characters have to overcome challenges, not just go through events.  And make sure you get into the personality of the protagonist--if we don't care about him, we won't care about any of it.  I'm thinking something along the lines of Elric from Moorcock's fantasies--a guy trying to find a bit of light in a dark world, only to find each bit of light, both in the world and himself, getting snuffed out by the evil surrounding him, but still never losing hope.|`|Q0nh3stqaa	I like it, but you have to realize that in pitching your work, less is more.

Google, Christopher Pascale and then check out the Amazon reviews.  Mine should be at the top listed as "From the Author."|`|O84V4pYIaa	I like the idea of the story, it sounds very interesting to me.<br>  <br>  The part I don't like is in the beginning. He spends some time honing his skills and searching for life... That could get boring real fast. I wouldn't spend too much time on this part, maybe just a few lines letting us know how much time has passed. <br>  <br>  Also, what skills is he honing? From the sounds of it he hasn't been aware of the warlock/demon part of him... <br>  <br>  Good work and keep writing!<br>  <br>  EDIT: I looked back and saw you mention a few skills he would be working on. I think that if you spend too much time talking about his 'powers' and what he can do with them it will definitely get boring. You should just let his powers be known through his actions throughout the book - don't tell us all of them right away.
4vbovQKJaa	Really, really interesting.  I enjoyed reading through that and I venture to say that if you write your story as well as you did your synopsis, you'd have a great novel/book on your hands.  It's creative and exciting (even it did evoke thoughts of Moses and the Promised Land), and I'd really like to see where it goes.  Well done and get writing!

BImAj5WIaa	She is supposed to be making a sequel just not at the minute.<br>  If you haven't already read the Twilight Saga then you should it's by Stephenie Meyer as well and it is Awesome<br>  <br>  Twilight-Bella Swan moves from Phoenix, Arizona to Forks, Washington to allow her mother, Renée, to travel with her new husband, Phil, a minor league baseball player. After moving to Forks, Bella finds herself involuntarily drawn to a mysterious, handsome boy, Edward Cullen. She eventually learns that he is a member of a vampire family who drink animal blood rather than human. Edward and Bella fall in love, but James, a sadistic vampire from another coven, is drawn to drink Bella's blood. Edward and the other Cullens defend Bella. She escapes to Phoenix, Arizona, where she is tricked into confronting James, who tries to kill her. She is mortally wounded, but Edward rescues her and they return to Forks.<br>  <br>  New Moon-Edward and his family leave Forks because he believes he is endangering Bella's life. Bella falls into a deep depression, until she develops a strong friendship with werewolf Jacob Black. Jacob and the other wolves in his tribe must protect her from Victoria, a vampire seeking to avenge her mate James' death by killing Bella. A misunderstanding occurs, and Edward believes Bella is dead. Edward decides to commit suicide in Volterra, Italy, but he is stopped by Bella and Alice, Edward's sister. They meet with the Volturi, a powerful coven of vampires, and are released on the condition that Bella be turned into a vampire in the near future. Bella and Edward are reunited, and the Cullens return to Forks.<br>  <br>  Eclipse-The vampire Victoria (James's mate from Twilight) has created an army of "newborn" vampires to battle the Cullen family and kill Bella. Meanwhile, Bella is forced to choose between her relationship with Edward and her friendship with Jacob. Edward's vampire family and Jacob's werewolf pack join forces to successfully destroy Victoria and her vampire army. In the end, Bella chooses Edward's love over Jacob's and agrees to marry him<br>  <br>  Breaking Dawn-Bella and Edward are married, but their honeymoon is cut short when Bella discovers she is pregnant. Her pregnancy progresses rapidly, making her weak. She nearly dies giving birth to her and Edward's half-vampire-half-human daughter, Renesmee, but Edward injects Bella with his venom to save her life by turning her into a vampire. A vampire from another coven sees Renesmee and mistakes her for an "immortal child", whose existence violates vampire rules, and informs the Volturi. The Cullens gather vampire witnesses who can verify that the child is not one of the immortal children. The Cullens and their witnesses convince the Volturi that Renesmee poses no danger to vampires or their secret, and they are left in peace.<br>  <br>  If you haven't read them that's what they are about THEY ARE AWESOME!|`|E1QSHeR1aa	the best place to get the answer to that is at stephenie meyers official website, she promised to keep her fans posted about all her books and up coming works there. can't remember the exact address but if you google her name you are guarantee to find it.|`|n7JACV0Iaa	i dont think there is a sequel out yet...|`|A4b5VaFvaa	well 1st of all no offense or anything but its Stephenie not Stephanie  2nd yes she is supposed to make a sequel to the Host to explain more into Melanie and Ians love situation but right now she is taking a break to be with her family and spend time away from all things supernatural.|`|RrtUV5wcaa	a while ago, stephenie said that she wanted to get away from the whole twilight thing and was planning on writing a sequel to The Host, but it hasn't been confirmed, so i'm not sure. but i think she probably will :)
pR0pJNJkaa	Reconstruction was a horrible era in American History for blacks. It was suppose to be a new beginning of hope and freedom. Many of what the new freedmen were promised was never received. Also, many became slaves under a new name, indentured servants...they owed banks and lenders so much they were never free. Yet, worst of all was the violent tactics of intimidation used to "keep Negroes in their place"...Reconstruction did help blacks. Black people rising up during the civil rights era and demanding what was right was good. So as far as better or worse...it was better than slavery, but I don't know how much better.

WhUV9k6Jaa	My take on this is that The Creator created creators.  It's the one trait the transcends all borders, colors, philosophies, and religions.  All humans have an impulse to create.  Whether it's a novel, a mosque, a child, a home, a painting, etc. it is in these moments we feel most God-like.|`|hmsMpECkaa	Jesus was Jesus until the end.  The Saducees and the Pharisees all thought that nobody could forgive sins but God alone.  That was one reason that led Him to the cross.  Jesus said, 'Father, forgive them . . .'   Jesus never did want to show any power because that was not His purpose.  But, was God ready to avenge His Son?  If God avenged His Son, He would have no other Son to send.  Jesus was the Only Begotten Son of God.  The only one.  Jesus, at one time, was not flesh, but He became flesh and dwelt among us.  I don't think Jesus was sent to learn from us because the bible says, 'Man is a liar.'  Did God learn that from Jesus, though.  Probably.  I think that this earth is a designated school where you are prepared for a future non-flesh life, but that get's into a whole different subject.  One that is so understandable it is invisible, you can't grasp it with your senses so you don't believe it exists.  But, it does.<br>  You cannot anthropomorphously describe God.  You cannot assign emotion to God.  Nothing in the world of man is anything like the world of God.  The world of God controls the world of man and that's why Jesus had to become flesh.  But, that gets into another subject; the subject of Satan, the deceiver.  That also gets into why Jesus came.<br>  Jesus was Jesus until the end.  He cried to His Father, 'Eloi, Eloi, lama sabacthani' which is translated 'My God, My God, why has thou forsaken me.'  <br>  It is not that God forsook Jesus, God wanted His Son back standing beside Him!<br>  In the scientific mind of God, He saw that His experiment of sending His Son to Earth to remove the core of the teaching of Satan was taking longer than seen and would require more energy to remove because of the creative mind of man.  After the flood when Noah and his sons came off of the ark and offered burnt offerings to God, God accepted them.  But God set a standard.  One that is so obvious that it is unseen.  God said, 'Man's mind is evil continually.'  <br>  And we haven't proved Him wrong yet!|`|A01w1dHqaa	I see you are putting a lot of thought into our connection to God and who he is. A missing element is that people project their own weaknesses upon other people and upon God. <br>  If God thought of anything as being in need of correction or evil, the universe would not hold together. We are the ones with distorted thoughts nad perceptions and think that God must have them too. But we left God and He has given us the Holy Spirit to help us get our thoughts back together and with them our love. We are living in Heaven now. We see it through a lens of lies and hate, but we don't see it all the same way and many see it as more peaceful than their brothers.|`|26DoxkOBaa	I think humans are the perfect image of God because humans ARE God's image, ie., an illusion, and as God evolves his consciousness into order to know Himself through evolving illusory life forms, God seeks to perfect his image that He falsely mistakes to be His Reality. In human form God completes His consciousness and mistakes illusion and his perfect image as real and His finite ego-mind as His self.|`|3d7f120f2bf9906d7333799542b3a295aa	Me thinks that there is a plan unfolding, a drama being played out on earth from a  hidden script written by the mind of God eons ago, and that involves an eternal destiny for man according to God's purpose.|`|Z6TNsJluaa	God desired fellowship and relationship when He created Adam, since Adam committed high treason against him, God didn't destroy him but the fact of God's unconditional love, God allowed Adam and mankind to see exactly what the wages of sin is all about. Here you have a fallen Archangel who is the very one in which sin was conceived, as He is the father of it. Satan in his own way of thinking, wasted to be "LIKE GOD" and of coarse, it is impossible for an angel to be GOd, God is also showing him that by trying to obtain a Throne, unrighteousness will not grant it. So here we have both man and Satan working together, and somehow both wanting to overthrow Almighty God. God sent us His Son, so that mankind could be set free from the power and deceptions of sin, to be reborn and made pure in the eyes of God and given a supreme choice to do so, on the other hand, you have Satan and mankind wanting to exalt "SELF!" Where there is no Supreme God to be accountable unto. But God has already Judge the actions of Satan and made a place of Destiny for him since the sins that has infested and corrupted him cannot be washed away. He has become the source of all evil and the power he once held over mankind has been broken by sacrifice Jesus gave of his own life, mankind, unless they come to Christ, people will die defiled and because of sin, they have the same nature and likeness of their father, Satan. This is why divine Judgment must come. Mankind cannot change themselves for the better. Mankind cannot free themselves from the stain of immoral sin that has effected them to the very cord of their being. Again, this is why God sent us Jesus, so that we could be reborn into the very image and likeness of Christ and once again walk and talk in divine fellowship and relationship with God, our Creator of all living things. Christ promised that he will return and put Satan and those who followed him into a bottomless pit and for 1000 years, those who were born of the righteous seed of Christ, washed in his precious blood, and filled with the power of His Spirit, we will rule and reign with Christ Jesus in glorified bodies, never to experience Satan, sin, sickness, poverty, physical and spirital death ever again. Now we can have divine fellowship, now we can walk as true kings of God, now we can experience the joy, the peace, the unconditional love of God. This was God's plan from the very beginning but the wages of sin is death. God hates it, and sin will not make it's way back into heaven now that Satan has been cast out and those who refuse to come to Christ, and prove that they love sin more than God, they will get the same destiny that Satan himself is headed for, The lake of Fire..And as we read in the Old Testament, God never once brought forth any divine Judgment before he warned the people first to turn from their wickedness, when they refused, judgment came. It is the same in this day and hour. God says' Come and let us reason together, though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as wool. Though they be red as crimson, they shall be white as snow!  God loves His creation and has made a way to come back into fellowship with him. If people refuse, God will never be blamed for the choice people made in refusing his love..|`|145c8348c6805dffd8ad539dedd6effbaa	Personally, I believe George Lucas got it right when he called it "The Force."

We were indeed made in His image. He is God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. The Triune God, 3 in 1. We are spiritual beings, who live in a body, and possess a soul (the seat of our intellect and emotions). We are triune beings, who will also live forever. Our body will be changed to an immortal one. <br>   1Cr 15:53 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal [must] put on immortality.  1Cr 15:54 So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. <br>  In regards to further comments, you are right when you say God (Who is Love) wanted to share (give) His love to others. You cannot love without giving. But to say that God was lonely is in error. Notice the verse;   Gen 1:26 And God said, Let us make man in OUR image, after OUR likeness: God had perfect fellowship in Himself. This is plumbing the depths of wisdom, not to be taken lightly. These are "spiritual" truths. Look at this:<br>  1Cr 2:12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. <br>  1Cr 2:13 Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. <br>  1Cr 2:14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know [them], because they are spiritually discerned. <br>  Also, since God is Omniscient (knows all things) then He is never surprised, never learns. He saw eternity future from the beginning. All of this cannot be seen or understood without faith and the indwelling presence of God (the Holy Spirit, given to all believers at the moment of salvation).<br>  Comment on "the compassion of Jesus." Yes, He was (and is) One with the Father and very loving. He was also (on earth) willing to upset those who would listen to the truth:<br>  Mat 12:34 O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.  <br>  Mat 23:33 [Ye] serpents, [ye] generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?  <br>  Jhn 2:14 And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:  <br>  Jhn 2:15 And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;  <br>  These are all the words of Jesus.<br>  Jesus Himself told us why He was sent. Luk 19:10 For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.|`|LEksBPlPaa	Nice false dilemma you set up...<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  Man created god in his own image.

It costs ￡7.00.  Bear in mind that Births, Marriages and Deaths were recorded at the GRO four times a year - 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December.  The local registrar sent his original copies to the GRO at the end of each quarter so, if a birth occurred on 31st December, it is probable that the birth will appear in the March quarter of the following year.  Local churches have copies of burials but most of these are in County Record Offices.

Often, actors will know other actors' lines better than they know their own. This is because they hear the other actors repeat their lines constantly through the length of a rehearsal.<br>  <br>  Whenever you read it, read it out loud. Even more so, read -everyone's- parts out loud. This way, you will get used to hearing their parts as they come before yours.  Learning lines of others that precede yours will also help out greatly if one of them manages to slip or forget a line. Knowing their lines allows you to cover their mistakes and keep a scene from breaking down entirely.<br>  <br>  So, in short: Read it out loud to yourself. Record yourself reading it out loud, and listen to your recording.

oKYB3Po7aa	Hitler wanted to unite the German people, after he took the sudetenland and then the rest of that country Britain and France said they would go to war if Poland was invaded.  Germany signed a pact with Russia, thinking if they both attacked Poland then Britain couldn't declare war unless she went to war with Russia also.  Britain claimed later on that she only would go to war if "Germany" invaded.  Hitler waited, and after Russia invaded Finland, without the rest of the world condemning her, Germany knew that she would have to fight France and Britain before pursuing what they really wanted "russia".|`|ZmdIlkpQaa	The Poles certainly would not have invaded Germany!!!!<br>  <br>  Hitler was looking to secure his Eastern border before turning on the West, and to do so he signed a secret pact with the Soviets which divided Poland in half, and then invaded Poland.  The invasion finally caused the French and British to give up on the idea of appeasement and declare war, but there was literally no way to get anyone to help the Poles, and so the British and French (and the portions of the German Army facing them) prepared as best they could while doing almost nothing.  This period was called the "Phoney War" or is sometimes known, more humorously, as the "Sitzkrieg."|`|fcf427fccc8fa8230c38f4b869207e8aaa	Poland was an ally of France. It also divided Germany from it's province of Prussia- which meant a very long and exposed border.<br>  <br>  The Germans knew that if they attacked France, Poland would react (no sitting around behind the Maginot line like the French did) so it made sense to eliminate the weaker opponent first (and not give them time to get stronger) then turn on the stronger opponent with full force.|`|F2ygsPEbaa	You probably don't have time to do this before your report is due but if you are interested in all the background, you should read "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich" by William Shirer.  Hitler decided to invade Poland to find "Lebensraum" (land) for people of Germanic decent, allegedly.  But really he was a power-hungry madman.<br>  <br>  I think his being a power hungry madman also had a lot to do with the start of World War II, although arguably, the world learned that future "agreements" like the Treaty of Versailles that economically penalized countries whose economies were already devastated didn't really solve anything.<br>  <br>  This is the very very short answer.<br>  <br>  (JOM above needs to learn how to read a map.)|`|9233401496ab10d52d1644174696a803aa	The attack on Poland started the War in Europe. Hitler has an obsession with the Germans being the pure race (Aryans). He regained some of these areas that had Germans into Germany through threats and negotiations. Austria, and Czechoslovakia as an example. For Hitler the war in the west was a sideshow, a prelude to the building of an empire in eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Hitler had hoped that Britain would stay out of the war. In his vision of the near future, he foresaw the two countries sharing the world between them--Britain would keep its overseas empire, and Germany would construct a new one to its east. When approached with the suggestion of a separate peace, British prime minister Winston Churchill rejected the offer and rallied his people to fight on. The Third Reich experienced its first military defeat in the Battle of Britain, in which the Royal Air Force, during the summer and fall of 1940, prevented the German air force from gaining the air superiority necessary for an invasion of Britain. Consequently, Hitler postponed the invasion. The European part of WW II started on 9/1/1939. But in Asia it started with Japan attacking Manchuria and Korea in 1931.|`|shVgCizBaa	The history of Poland from 1939 to 1945 encompasses the German invasion of Poland through to the end of World War II. On September 1, 1939, without a formal declaration of war, Germany invaded Poland. Germany's pretext was that Polish troops had allegedly committed "provocations" along the German-Polish border, which was actually a staged attack by the Germans. Germany also used issues like the dispute between Germany and Poland over German rights to the Free City of Danzig and the freeing of a passage between East Prussia and the rest of Germany through the Polish Corridor as excuses for the invasion. Pursuant to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, Poland was divided between Germany and the Soviet Union, which invaded eastern Poland on September 17, 1939.Under the terms of two decrees by Hitler (8 October and 12 October 1939), large areas of western Poland were annexed to Germany. These included all the territories which Germany had lost under the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, such as the Polish Corridor, West Prussia and Upper Silesia, but also a large area of indisputably Polish territory east of these territories, including the city of ?ód?.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Poland_(1939%E2%80%931945)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_...</a>|`|AA10303012	Maybe they wanted to have a "buffer zone" between Russia and themselves?

It is perfectly possible for the world 'as we know it today' to end on that date. An invention could do this.  It is possible for the human species (indeed all life on earth) to be wiped out on that date.  An asteroid collision with the earth could do this.  This, however, would only mean this mean the end in terms of immediate life.  It would return.<br>  It is even possible for the entire planet to be obliterated on that date; but *as a result of* the Mayan calendar?  <br>  <br>  If the prediction is in religious terms then the 'end' could mean divine intervention of some kind.  Such an end, while not scientifically supported, cannot be disproved.  Only why should the Mayans be right in this case when so many others (including themselves at one time or another) have been wrong with predictions?  Personally I'd point out that no god has ever interceded in such a manner over the whole of recorded human history, so I think it unlikely to happen in this case.<br>  <br>  Assuming you mean 'Are all humans going to be dead by 2012, in line with Mayan prediction?' then I'd answer that while this is possible, and even feasible, I don't think it will happen.  Such a close date would require an apocalyptic scenario to occur; global warming will take too long and no sufficiently large asteroids, which will approach earth at that date, have been observed.  Thus such an end would seem most likely to be via terrorism or war combined with retaliatory action, both involving nuclear and/or biological weapons but even this would likely not eradicate every last human being.  Many governments and rich individuals/organizations have prepared bunkers in the event of such a catastrophe.<br>  <br>  My own prediction is that humanity will become extinct as early as within 50 years.

You should buy your guitar from a local music store and not over the internet or from a big box store like Wal*Mart or Target or Best Buy.  Your local music store will support you if your guitar needs any adjustment and will show you how to change strings.  The other places won't or can't.|`|cUiUNunYaa	Guitars are measured in scale length,that's the distance from bridge to top nut,a longer scale length will give more sustain but the distance between the frets is more,so not so good for small fingers.A gibson semi has a scale length of 23 1/2 " good for complex chord shapes,not so good for sustain.after that it's down to body size,the bigger and deeper the body the more sound,so louder. A dreadnought is huge,lots of volume,different manufacturers have different gradings so little common ground.Anyway,numbers don't mean much,buy the one that's comfortable,that you can play,that sounds good,and then worry about how it looks.Road test.

ZB9zkbxxaa	The Anglo-Zulu War of 1879 remains one of the most dramatic in both British and southern African history, and has been immortalised in at least two feature films, ZULU and ZULU DAWN.<br>  <br>  In retrospect, the war was provoked by an unwarranted act of British aggression. The Zulu kingdom had first emerged early in the nineteenth century, with its heartland lying along the eastern seaboard of southern Africa, north of modern Durban. Within a few years, British adventurers were attracted to Zululand in search of trade and profit, and by the 1840s a British colony - Natal - had sprung up on the southern borders of Zululand. By the 1870s, the British had begun to adopt a 'forward policy' in the region, hoping to bring the various British colonies, Boer republics and independent African groups under common control, with a view to implementing a policy of economic development.<br>  <br>  The British High Commissioner in South Africa, Sir Henry Bartle Frere, believed that the robust and economically self-reliant Zulu kingdom was a threat to this policy. In December 1878 he picked a quarrel with the Zulu king, Cetshwayo kaMpande, in the belief that the Zulu army - armed primarily with shields and spears - would soon collapse in the face of British Imperial might. The war began in January 1879. Three columns of British troops under the command of Lt. Gen. Lord Chelmsford invaded Zululand. Almost immidiately, the war went badly wrong for the British.<br>  <br>  On 22 January, the Centre Column, under Lord Chelmsford's personal command, was defeated at Isandlwana mountain. In one of the worst disasters of the Colonial era, over 1300 British troops and their African allies were killed. In the aftermath of Isandlwana, the Zulu reserves mounted a raid on the British border post at Rorke's Drift, which was held by just 145 men. After ten hours of ferocious fighting, the Zulu were driven off. Eleven of the defenders of Rorke's Drift were awarded the Victoria Cross. The British flanking columns also saw action that same day.<br>  <br>  On the coast, the right flank column brushed aside Zulu resistence at the Nyezane river, before advancing to occupy the deserted mission station at Eshowe. The left flank column was also involved in heavy skirmishing around the Hlobane mountain. The British collapse at Isandlwana left the flanking columns exposed, however. The Zulus managed to cut Col. Pearson's right-flank column off from the border, and Pearson's men were besieged for three months at Eshowe. Only the left flank column remained operative.<br>  <br>  The success at Isandlwana exhausted the Zulu army, however, and Cetshwayo was unable to mount a counter-offensive into Natal. This gave Lord Chelmsford time to regroup. British troops were rushed to South Africa from around the Empire. By the end of March the war was poised to enter a new phase. Lord Chelmsford assembled a column to march to the relief of Eshowe, and directed the commander of the Left Flank Column - Sir Evelyn Wood - to make a diversionary attack. Wood's men attacked a local Zulu stronghold - Hlobane mountain - on 28 March, but were surprised by the unexpected arrival of the main Zulu army, and scattered. The following day, however, the Zulu attacked Wood's camp at Khambula, and after several hours of heavy fighting, were driven off. Meanwhile Lord Chelmsford had crossed into Zululand, marching towards Eshowe.<br>  <br>  On 2nd April he broke through the Zulu cordon around Eshowe at kwaGingindlovu, and relieved Pearson's column. The defeat of the Zulu king's forces in two actions, at either end of the country, and within days of each other, demoralised the Zulu, and proved to be the turning point of the war. Lord Chelmsford reorganised his forces, and in late May was poised to mount a new invasion of Zululand. This, too, began badly, when, on 1 June, the exiled Prince Imperial of France, Louis Napoleon, who was serving with the British in an unofficial capacity, was killed in a skirmish.<br>  <br>  Nevertheless, British troops continued to advance towards the Zulu capital, Ulundi, which they reached at the end of June. On 4 July Chelmsford defeated the Zulu army in the last great battle of the war. Ulundi was put to the torch, and King Cetshwayo fled. Chelmsford resigned after the victory at Ulundi, but it took several weeks for the British to suppress lingering resistence in the outlying districts. King Cetshwayo was eventually captured and sent into exile at Cape Town. The British divided his country up among thirteen pro-British chiefs - a deliberately divisive move which led to a decade of destructive civil war.|`|KHSOVxViaa	The Anglo-Zulu war of 1879 was begun as an unauthorised invasion of Zululand by an adventurer in the British Army.<br>  <br>  There had been tensions between British authorities in Natal colony and the neighbouring Zulu nation prior to this, mainly boundary disputes and trans-tribal tensions straddling the border.<br>  <br>  This was heightened after Zulu King Cetewayo ordered the massacre of a large number of girls, as part of an internal struggle in Zululand against encroaching Christianity.  The British issued a list of demands to Cetewayo, intending to right certain perceived wrongs, reducing his army, and allow missionaries free access to his kingdom.  The king did not reply to this.<br>  <br>  A British officer, General Thesiger, Baron Chelmsford, took a force of over 10,000 and invaded part of Zululand in three columns, without any official authorisation.  They established a series of guarded way-stations along their routes.<br>  <br>  Part of the central column camped at Isandlwana, but the local commander, Chelmsford, refused to fortify, ignoring reports of a Zulu army nearby.  The 40,000-strong Zulus attacked and wiped out the encampment, more than 1,000 dying on each side.  A few survivors managed to retreat to the way-station of Rorkes' Drift, where they held off a sustained Zulu attack over 10 hours.  Several more battles occurred, and the British largely withdrew.<br>  <br>  Public opinion in Britain swung in favour of the war, and the government authorised further action to avenge the defeat.  British forces again invaded, and decisively defeated the Zulus at Ulundi.  Cetewayo was eventually captured, and Zululand began to fall under the sway of Natal colony.|`|iJzIIEdfaa	The British ambassador sent demands to the Zulu king in the hopes of making him declare war. The Zulu king refused to comply and the British sent an army to 'subjugate the savages' by invading Zululand.<br>  The king was not cowed and gathered his own army and in a brilliant ambush, caught the British by surprise and decimated their force.<br>  <br>  Later, another more powerful British army arrived and invaded Zululand successfully, defeating the Zulu army at Ulundi.|`|1hvrQYWiaa	The Zulu kingdom maintained a large standing army, which the British saw as a threat to the safety of their South Africa colony. They demanded that the Zulu king, Cetawayo, disband his army. When Cetawayo refused, the British invaded with the intention of annexing the Zulu kingdom outright.

They basically said it was ridiculous, outdated, and didn't relate to modern standards.

lmVDvmMCaa	The "meanings" on the site are bogus, and are based on an old book in which the author made up meanings (W. Cecil Wade's "The Symbolisms of Heraldry or A Treatise on the Meanings and Derivations of Armorial Bearings". Published in London in 1898).   <br>  <br>  Each person who designs his arms intends certain meanings for the charges, ordinaries, and tinctures.  There are only a few charges that have universal meaning, e.g. some religious symbols.  Otherwise, it's up to the armiger.  For example, a heart could mean "love," or it could tell the story of a battle, or it could be a pun on the armiger's name, such as for Mr. Haertfield.   <br>  <br>  Bottom line: you have to know who the original armiger was in order to know what he intended, and even then the design may remain a mystery.<br>  <br>  --added--<br>  <br>  In our family history, we find (on maternal lines) the arms of Jason Fargo   (New London, CT) and the Munro clan chief (Scotland).  The Fargo arms have a lion, and no one knows what it means.  The Munro arms have an eagle's head, and they are probably derivative of the Ross eagle supporter.  The Munros were vassals of the Earls of Ross.|`|AA12343309	Families as a rule don't have coats of arms. The only exception in Europe might be France or Poland.  They definitely don't belong to surnames.<br>  <br>  They were granted to or assumed by an individual man and only his direct legitimate male line descendants are entitled to them.  <br>  <br>  Now if you received your coat of arms from your father and he got it from his father and so only back down the line it it legitimately yours.  However, if it is one being sold by one of the peddlers on the internet, at shopping malls, in airports, in magazines what you have is a coat of arms that belongs to one man and one man alone.    To display it as yours would be considered usurpation of identity.  If you have pride in yourself and your family, you certainly don't want to take on another's identity.<br>  <br>  Here are some links to various countries regarding heraldry.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/Faq.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/Faq.ht...</a><br>  This is the British College of Arms.

That family history will not be the family history of everyone with that particular surname.  Surnames were not taken in Europe until the last millennium. In England most had one by the end of th 14th century and still it was a few more centuries before the same name was passed down to subsequent generations in many cases.  In the Netherlands it was 1811 during the reign of Napoleon.   They were not started so much to identify a person as a member of a family but for taxation purposes.  Too many Waldos in the same town or village and they had to tell them apart.<br>  <br>  When they got through it wasn't impossible for legitimate sons of the same man to have a different surname and still each could have shared their surname with others unrelated. Some will say we are all related if we go back far enough. However, the root person of your surname will not necessarily be the root person of someone else with your surname.
ahjqc9Ifaa	Publishers tend to seek works on the short side from new authors whose names will not help sell books, for the simple reason that short = lower production costs.<br>  <br>  It's also fairly common for writers with less experience to write a bit "fat," using more words than are necessary to tell their stories. So a novel that's short is probably also one that's tight and lean.<br>  <br>  Each genre and within them each subgenre has ideal word counts. I'm sorry, I don't know the one for YA fantasy. Fantasy for adult readers tends to hover right around 100,000 for unknown authors' first novels.|`|w7USF5wDaa	I would say no.  There seem to be a fashion over the past few years (probably started by the later Harry Potter novels) for young adult fantasy to be longer and longer.  If you look in that section at bookstores these days the shelves are filled with books the size of cinder blocks.  Not only is larger size a real trend, it also appears that the majority of young adult fantasy is part of at least a trilogy if not a longer series.  I don't think being shorter will hurt your book necessarily, but neither do I think it will help.<br>  <br>  Cheers.|`|wKSvnna2aa	I read that too.

You are a drunken sot because you have found it easier to seek sympathy for the pathetic conditions brought on by your lack of self-control than to exercise your willpower to remedy them.]<br>  <br>  >"Don't call me 'fat', - I eat too much because McDonald's is just around the corner, - so it's McDonald's fault"...<br>  [NO!!!... You're a fvcking lard-@ss because you would much rather stimulate your palate by eating a triple Quarter-Pounder with Cheese, Large Fries (and a diet Coke) than stimulate your metabolism by exercising.]<br>  <br>  >"I'm mad because somebody called me a name I didn't like"...<br>  [NO!!!... You are mad because you have been conditioned to be so by those who use Political-Correctness as a front to gain sympathy, --- and all the benefits that now go with it.]<br>  <br>  Must I go on?...<br>  <br>  Words are just that: Words...<br>  To get upset at something that someone says, particularly with an obvious jest, is the mark of an addled mind.<br>  It's time to put down the dogma of Political-Correctness so that we may, once again, --- not take ourselves so damn seriously...<br>  -|`|a7758985bc328f86aea63a86e0cd5cfdaa	Not very.<br>  If you take it to be an extreme form of politeness it's one thing.<br>  Can be  a non confrontational way to refer to sometimes delicate topics.<br>  Can also be filled w/ double meanings & passive agression.<br>  I prefer honesty.|`|eezP5wQ2aa	...said the politician to the voter...<br>  ...why should it matter when it changes when the doors close...|`|7b089b25ed98306d5886ba461eb9a7a1aa	I personally think being PC is over-rated.

Racism and hatred of foreigners was just a given. if you grew up in a perfect society then you would have no residual twisted attitudes. Almost no Americans can say that though. So for a typical American, speaking and acting politically correctly serves as "training wheels" on their better attitudes and information. Behavior is the quickest, maybe the ONLY WAY to change ideas and feelings, so if you ACT like you aren't racist, you may eventually eliminate racism from your internal culture.<br>  <br>  People who think a little social discomfort is not worth the end of lynchings, gay-bashings and a culture that brushes rape under the rug, are obviously most in need of political correcting.|`|AA11562077	Not "to be" but to know what it is.  'Politically Correct' has had other names in the past.  'Puritanism', 'National Socialism' (Nazism) to name a couple of them.<br>  <br>  PC is a self-congratulatory term which a certain type of person who believes in regimentation and judgment of others usually gives themselves.  The use of the word "Correct" is no more accurate than the Soviet Union calling itself the 'Union of Democratic Soviet Socialist Republics', which was its actual name -- the 'UDSSR'.<br>  <br>  Incidentally, the use of the word "Republican" by many current US right-wingers is for the most part a similar misnomer.  What they really mean is Elitist.  But of course that would be a harder to sell until we finally get to the "Two Legs Good, Four Legs Bad" apotheosis of the story.

It's a fantasy novel about a boy named Jack who can flip from one dimension to another by taking a sip of wine. He finds out later on that he really doesn't need it.

ahjqc9Ifaa	I'm okay with any number, but I'm also acutely aware that far too often the inexperienced writer uses multiple POVs because he or she has not learned how to give the reader information in any other way. That's amateurish and I don't like it.<br>  <br>  The only justification for multiple POVs is when the whole point of using more than one is to show how different characters perceive the same events.|`|a0a4b271882587e60ffff0e04ab06fb3aa	Yes, in fact, I prefer multiple POV's in a novel. Tom Clancy has used that style to perfection. I also use it in my fantasy books, sometimes with as many as five or more POV changes in the same chapter. You have to be careful to avoid making abrupt changes or POV shifts that aren't clear to the reader. Never overdo a good thing.<br>  <br>  My rule of thumb is, if he/she is not a major character in the story, don't give that person their own POV. Also, it works well if you use dialogue to indicate a POV shift, although that is not a requirement.<br>  <br>  Good question.

n99NOgHJaa	Yay ! Your going to play the violin ! I've only played for a couple years but looove it !  I would follow what people have suggested so far but I will add that you  should read everything you can get your hands on about music theory and violin. It may not make any sense right away but someday you'll come across something you have all ready read and be totally siked that you knew that all ready.! ( but you don't have to if you dont want to . it might help) I also listen to tons of classical and fiddle music, it helps train your ear and just in general .<br>  Hope you completely and totally enjoy your lessons and playing the violin !  r when you might feel bogged down that EVERYONE had worked hard and struggled at some point and you just keep going !!! Oh also look up the group "Barrage" They will totally make you excited to play!!!|`|T547TtDRaa	Relax until your first lesson.  No sense in getting into bad habits of playing it incorrectly until your first lesson.  Have fun.  Music is an excellent skill to learn.  It can give you skills that you'll use the rest of your life.|`|FC4VXL4saa	There isn't much you can do, <br>  I would recommend you look through the book, it will probably tell you some important things you need to learn at first, like for instance you need to learn about the notes and things.<br>  So read through it and get clued up on little bits and bobs so that when you start your lessons, you know things like this.<br>  But I wouldn't advice you to do very much else - if you've never played the violin before, you need your teacher to show you how to hold it, how to use the bow and things - it's a gradual way of doing things that will slowly develop as your teacher shows you how so you need to wait really :) Be patient and it will be great when you do actually start.|`|W7wEgy1Eaa	I'm a violin instructor in my spare time.  (Ha ha) and the best advice I can give you is to get to know all the parts of your violin.<br>  <br>  There are a couple of don'ts:  <br>  <br>  DO NOT completely unscrew all the hair from the bow.  You have no idea what a mess it makes and your teacher will spend a lot of time trying to look stern while she's actually laughing her *** off.<br>  <br>  DO NOT touch the area where the bow crosses the strings.  You might notice a bit of what looks like donut powder underneath from where the "bridge" is across to the "neck" where the strings cross.  That's not powdered sugar---that's ROSIN and it's sticky and you'll never get it off your hands.  Ever.  It's supposed to make the tightened bow slip better across the strings when you are playing.  If you put your fingers all over those strings, you get your icky body oils on them and TARNATION, BUT THEY ARE BUGGERED!<br>  <br>  DO NOT practice near anyone who actually likes violin music.  Practice as much and as often as you can near your sister who is talking on the phone; near your granny who is seeking privacy in the garden; in the middle of the kitchen, so EVERYONE knows your true dedication to the instrument, and even in the toilet because of the GREAT ACOUSTICS.<br>  <br>  That is all.<br>  <br>  :)  ~Cirese|`|0AUPrCMZaa	it wouldn't hurt you to get to know the instrument before your first lesson.

NYU37jfGaa	My son is in year 6 (the British equivalent of 6th grade), and his favourite author is Anthony Horowitz, who writes very exciting adventure stories about a boy spy called Alex Rider, and another series which is about children with supernatural powers, Power of Five.<br>  <br>  He also really likes the 'Artemis Fowl' series by Eoin Colfer, which are fantasy novels about a boy genius who is a thief and gets involved with the secret world of fairies. Lots of good characters and exciting plots, with plenty of humour.<br>  <br>  The Narnia books by C S Lewis were favourites of mine when I was eleven, the first one The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe is a particularly popular title.<br>  <br>  'The Wolves of Willoughby Chase' by Joan Aiken was another book I loved when I was eleven, an exciting adventure story set in the 1840s in england, with lots of excitement and suspence.  If she likes it there are several sequels.<br>  <br>  'The Saturdays' by Elizabeth Enright was another favourite of mine at that age.  Set in New York in the 1940s, it is about a family of children who decide to pool their allowances so that each of them can go out and do something exciting in turn, and the book describes all their various adventures.  it's a book I have always been very fond of.<br>  <br>  'Thimble Summer' also by Elizabeth Enright, has a country setting and tells the story of a summer in the life of Garnet, who lives on a farm.  Another delightful story.<br>  <br>  'Jennifer, Hecate, Macbeth, William McKinley and Me' by e.L. Konigsburg was another favourite of mine at her age.  It is a delightful story about a girl who has trouble making friends at school, but then meets a girl who claims to be awitch, and offers to take her on as an apprentice.  Very amusing story, and Jennifer (the supposed witch) is a wonderful character.<br>  <br>  If she is interested in history, there is a series called The Royal Diaries, which are books in the form of diaries by different princesses through history, describing their lives and experiences, Marie Antoinette, Elizabeth I, Eleanor of Aquitaine, all sorts of princesses from different periods of history.  They are the kind of thing I would have enjoyed readin gif they had been published when I was that age.<br>  <br>  Or perhaps if she likes mystery she might enjoy the Nancy Drew books by Carolyn Keene, still going strong after all these years?  They're good fun with fast moving plots.<br>  <br>  I think Meg Cabot's Princess Diaries series is extremely funny, and although the heroine, Mia, is a bit older than your daughter, most girls enjoy reading about the adventures of older girls.|`|RjyNInW6aa	I suggest Harry Potter. I started reading it in 6th grade and was so absorbed in it that  finished the series in like 2 months and i wasn't a big reader then. <br>  <br>  Or<br>  the shadow children series by Margret Peterson Haddix<br>  Where the Red Fern Grows<br>  Island of the Blue Dolphins<br>  Inkheart<br>  <br>  That's all I can think of. my mind has gone blank.|`|79YQAbSRaa	I used the journal style books to get my kids more interested, and they all loved these.  My 7th grader has now moved on to just about anything in the young adult section at the library, but these were the ones  that really sparked her interest in reading at the beginning of 6th grade.<br>  <br>  Dear Dumb Diary series by Jim Benton, the first one is Let's Pretend This Never Happened.  4th and 5th grade level.<br>  <br>  Diary of a Wimpy Kid by Jeff Kinney.  4 books written from a boy's perspective. 5th grade level.<br>  <br>  Amelia's Notebooks by Marissa Moss..There's quite a few in this series.  Same diary type book, but with color in the pages and looks more like a real diary. 4th and 5th grade reading level.<br>  <br>  Something a little easier, but still funny and interesting are the Franny K. Stein books by Jim Benton.  They're in a 5th grade level also but they're shorter books.<br>  <br>  All the grade levels are based on the Renaissance Learning Accelerated Reader Program.<br>  <br>  You might also want to consider graphics.  They go way beyond comic book.  You can get anything from non-fiction titles to classics in a graphic format. <br>  <br>  We also picked up some books on CD at the library along with the book.  It was easier to keep them interested in longer books if they had the CD to go along with it.<br>  <br>  I wholeheartedly agree that trying juvenile titles over young adult with a reluctant reader is a good idea.  Sometimes, those longer books are just too daunting for them.|`|C7FxHBwBaa	you also might try juvenile fiction series, those books tend to be thinner and a little more action packed. also maybe some short story collections

AA11374522	1) A religion in and of itself can neither be good nor evil. It is merely a collection of ideas incapable of acting of it's own accord.

I think she wrote also because even though that she had friends they wouldn't understand somethings that she felt inside of her. They re somethings that are better of kept in a diary I guess. The diary (a note book) doesn't judge you or criticized you.  she expressed about how she felt about school , the war, about her own family.|`|nfUomw3caa	Ann Frank's diary is important because it shows, that of the six million Jews killed in the Holocaust, they were people with hopes and dreams like all people.

You can't even listen to radio until the shop is closed for the night and there is no TV.  <br>  <br>  There were books to read, but they were mostly adult books.  When you've read through those, what else is there to do?  Anne's diary was her escape.

shVgCizBaa	The Founding Fathers on the Constitution's War Power<br>  <br>       Alexander Hamilton:  "The President is to be commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United States. . . .  It would amount to nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces, as first General and Admiral of the Confederacy; while that of the British king extends to the declaring of war and the raising and regulating of fleets and armies, -- all of which by the Constitution under consideration, would appertain to the legislature."  (The Federalist, 69, 1788.)<br>        ". . . .'The Congress shall have the power to declare war'; the plain meaning of which is, that it is the peculiar and exclusive duty of Congress, when the nation is at peace, to change that state into a state of war. . . ." (C. 1801.) <br>  <br>       Thomas Jefferson:  "We have already given in example one effectual check to the dog of war by transferring the power of letting him loose from the Executive to the Legislative body. . . ."  (Letter to Madison, 1789.)<br>       "Considering that Congress alone is constitutionally invested with the power of changing our condition from peace to war, I have thought it my duty to await their authority for using force in any degree which could be avoided."  (Message to Congress, 1805.)<br>  <br>       James Madison:  ". . . The power to declare war, including the power of judging the causes of war, is fully and exclusively vested in the legislature . . . the executive has no right, in any case, to decide the question, whether there is or is not cause for declaring war."  (1793.)<br>       "The constitution supposes, what the History of all Governments demonstrates, that the Executive is the branch of power most interested in war, and most prone to it.  It has accordingly with studied care vested the question of war to the Legislature."  (Letter to Jefferson, c. 1798.)<br>  <br>       William Paterson framer and Supreme Court justice):  ". . . It is the exclusive province of congress to change a state of peace into a state of war." (United States v. Smith, 1806.)<br>       George Washington:  "The constitution vests the power of declaring war in Congress; therefore no offensive expedition of importance can be undertaken until after they shall have deliberated upon the subject and authorized such a measure."  (1793.)<br>       James Wilson:  (framer and ratifier):  "This system will not hurry us into war; it is calculated to guard against it.  It will not be in the power of a single man, or a single body of men, to involve us in such distress; for the important power of declaring war is vested in the legislature at large. . . ."  (To the Pennsylvania ratifying convention, 1787.)<a href="http://warandlaw.homestead.com/files/foundin2.html" rel="nofollow">http://warandlaw.homestead.com/files/fou...</a> --------------------------<br>  One of the most common statements from the "Religious Right" is that they want this country to "return to the Christian principles on which it was founded".  However, a little research into American history will show that this statement is a lie. The men responsible for building the foundation of the United States had little use for Christianity, and many were strongly opposed to it. They were men of The Enlightenment, not men of Christianity. They were Deists who did not believe the bible was true. <br>  When the Founders wrote the nation's Constitution, they specified that "no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States." (Article 6, section 3)   This provision was radical in its day-- giving equal citizenship to believers and non-believers alike.  They wanted to ensure that no single religion could make the claim of being the official, national religion, such as England had.  Nowhere in the Constitution does it mention religion, except in exclusionary terms.  The words "Jesus Christ, Christianity, Bible, and God" are never mentioned in the Constitution-- not once. <br>  <br>  The Declaration of Independence gives us important insight into the opinions of the Founding Fathers. Thomas Jefferson wrote that the power of the government is derived from the governed. Up until that time, it was claimed that kings ruled nations by the authority of God. The Declaration was a radical departure from the idea of divine authority. <br>  <br>  The 1796 treaty with Tripoli states that the United States was "in no sense founded on the Christian religion" (see below). This was not an idle statement, meant to satisfy muslims-- they believed it and meant it. This treaty was written under the presidency of George Washington and signed under the presidency of John Adams. <a href="http://freethought.mbdojo.com/foundingfathers.html" rel="nofollow">http://freethought.mbdojo.com/foundingfa...</a>|`|zH1sg3Xraa	America was born out of the American Revolution so we became free from England. The American people then fought Mexico and took Texas away from Mexico and the western states and California. So, they had a varied viewpoint of why to fight a war. They killed countless Indians to spread out west and then killed countless Mexicans to take over Teas and the western states and all of California. In all the world and in all history books, you will find that if you win the war, you will find people fighting over land and money and trying to get more land and money.

hl4kkvXhaa	There's no specific age to get published.  Obviously, if you're asking this question, your asking for advice on good storylines for a book to write, so the person who answered "Twilight" is wrong.  <br>  <br>  The best stories are those that come from within you.  If you try to write a book based on emotions you've never experienced, it will be flat and lifeless...the best books come from within your own heart.<br>  <br>  I can't give you a storyline, but I can give you some advice.  Think about a time in your life that had a huge impact on you.  The death of a family member...a beloved friend or pet...anything that brings emotional feelings.  Write about it.  You don't have to copy the story exactly as it happened...the great thing about writing is that you can change it to what you think should have happened or how you should have reacted, and how you believe the outcome would have changed.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|SfHXkx6baa	Twilight. No doubt about it. It appeals to both guys and girls. For girls, we have a love story (it's not gross and gushy like Romeo and Juliet), and for guys, we have vampires and some awesome butt kicking. I recommend seeing the movie first though. In the movie, a girl vampire named Alice LITERALLY takes a guy vampire's head off. Also, there is vampire baseball which will never make you think of baseball in the same way again. The movie did a good job of depicting it with the high speed baseballs flying through the air, vampires running super fast (think Superman), and an awesome beat accompanying it. And for girls, once you start reading it, you just can't stop.

Well there isn't really one, just write your story and keep going over and over it again and again until you are 100% sure that this book is good- not 99.9%, it has to be 100% if you want it to be good.<br>  <br>  Some advice: Try not giving the book to people you know that they will say its good just to be nice and not hurt your feelings, your book will be no good then!

Who knows, if Alan Freed and Leo Mintz had not started the one of the biggest raves of the 20th century, the American market may not have become what it is today; youth oriented. Rock music was aimed at the younger generation, therefore; teens and young adults became the primary consumers of rock and roll records. Teenagers were and still are more easily persuaded than adults due to lack of life experience. When teens began buying rock and roll records by the millions, other companies began advertising their products to teenagers. Rock music has played a key roll in helping to keep the American economy booming. Rock and roll has been the most popular type of music for nearly 40 years. The music that was listened to by the teens of the exciting decade of the 50's is still loved by the generation X teens of today.

It has a lot to do with applying reason and science and the use of 'inherent' values such as fairness.<br>  <br>  It's proponents don't usually suggest that natural law is the ONLY law, but rather that these laws are a kind of baseline which cannot really be violated without trouble occurring.  On top of natural laws are usually added a number of other laws to make societies work (which are called 'positive laws' in this context).<br>  <br>  Natural law may overlap with other ethical notions.  For example, if you believe the world was created by gods, you may see natural law as a subset of divine laws (as in divine command theory).|`|69ZUgQskaa	its basically anything that interfers with the natural process of life.<br>  <br>  e.g. when women have abortions it prevents natural predicaments. <br>  <br>  but on the other hand...<br>  <br>  ...you could say that other mammals kill their born and so why shouldnt we?<br>  <br>  ** so you need to be careful the way you go about it**

Also, the harsh treatment of Germany by the French (via WWI's Armistice) created a lot of bitterness that built up over time.

vvdc5EnTaa	well, as having published work myself (Amanda Frazier), I like your poem. It shows potential but it is hard to grasp onto. There are too many questions so close together. I like the rhyme, but in parts it seems forced. Especially the last line. <br>  I'm having trouble with the line "Have you ever thought about the way we were brought"... it doesn't really make sense. <br>  You have lots of misspelling but those I assume are just typos. <br>  Good poem.

QaG5WDMLaa	Ok, there are a couple of ways, that I know of.<br>  <br>  1st, I'm going to assume you are in the UK, if you're not, then the companies I suggest may not be relevant, but anyway!<br>  <br>  1) Rubber latex mould. This is where you buy a container of liquid latex, and literally paint over a shape, or whatever you want the mould to be of, in loads of layers, and it builds up a mould. PROS; Easy to do and cheap CONS; the mould will only be as strong as you make it thick, and the mould will break down over time.<br>  <br>  2) 2-part-silicon mould. This is where you mix a solution and pour it gently over the object you're casting. It solidifies leaving you with a rigid mould, not too different to as if you'd carved the cast object into a block of plastic PROS; Sturdy, long-lasting, Quick. CONS; More expensive then liquid latex (￡20 for 2 containers, combined size, around that of a small 1-pint carton of milk), could be too rigid for certain things, like jelly for example<br>  <br>  Anyway, I hoped I helped. <br>  <br>  All of this can be found in Hobbycraft (If you're in Uk, as aforementioned) in the sculpting section, if not, then check eBay, or any fairly LARGE craft store. Those that sell Clay and plaster of Paris SHOULD stock these items|`|AA11414292	From What?<br>  Not a good Idea as it has to be food safe!|`|AA11130249	I have looked at a website and thought about it<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.culinart.net/silicone.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.culinart.net/silicone.html</a><br>  <br>  Look and see if this is along the lines you want to go.

The title The Bluest Eye is based on Pecola's fervent wishes for beautiful blue eyes. She is rarely developed during the story, which is purposely done to underscore the actions of the other characters. Her insanity at the end of the novel is her only way to escape the world where she cannot be beautiful and to get the blue eyes she desires from the beginning of the novel. <br>  Cholly Breedlove - Pecola's abusive father, an alcoholic man who rapes his daughter at the end of the novel. Rejected by his father and discarded by his mother as a four day old baby, Cholly was raised by his Great Aunt Jimmy. After she dies, Cholly runs away and pursues the life of a "free man", yet he is never able to escape his painful past, nor can he live with the mistakes of his present. Tragically, he rapes his daughter in a gesture of madness mingled with affection. He realizes he loves her, but the only way he can express it is to rape her. <br>  Pauline Breedlove - Pecola's mother. Mrs. Breedlove is married to Cholly and lives the self-righteous life of a martyr, enduring her drunk husband and raising her two awkward children as best she can. Mrs. Breedlove is a bit of an outcast herself with her shriveled foot and Southern background. Mrs. Breedlove lives the life of a lonely and isolated character who escapes into a world of dreams, hopes and fantasy that turns into the motion pictures she enjoys viewing."

w13Zbnk7aa	Teach the embouchure first. without that, the flute is useless! You can fingerings on your own, you don't need a teacher for that. Tell her what T (thumb/Bb key), D (first trill key), D# (2nd trill key)...etc means. If you do not know, try sending her here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fluteinfo.com/Fingering_chart/modern.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.fluteinfo.com/Fingering_chart...</a><br>  <br>  This is an online version of the fingering chart. If she is first starting, she will probably have a student flute. Therefore, her flute will not play the lowest B natural on that fingering chart, or above the highest C on that fingering chart. Maybe teach her Bb, C, D, and Eb (on the staff) to start her off. Hot cross buns is a god song to start on. I learned that first in the yamaha band student books. <br>  <br>  If she does not master the embouchure correctly, she may be stunted in the future. Here is what could happen:<br>  1. If it is not even, she will not achieve a good tone.<br>  2. She may not be accepted into your state's All State program if she wishes to pursue this (if she is in high school). She also may not be let into an orchestra...period.

(trust me it's a hard habit to break) then i would work on the notes. this way she knows how to play the flute and isn't getting into bad habits.|`|uniAnFF7aa	Step1  Have the right accessories to keep the flute in good working order. such as a flute case, a tuning rod, a cleaning rag, a cleaning stick, a polishing cloth and a tiny duster. <br>  <br>  Step2  Assemble the flute parts correctly. Add the head joint to the middle section of the flute by gently pushing the head into the middle part. <br>  <br>  Step3  Adjust the head so the keys align with the keys on the body of the flute. Add the foot of the flute and make sure the keys line up properly with the rest of the keys. <br>  <br>  Step4  Position your hands correctly on the flute. Place the left hand at the top of the flute resting your left fingers on the top keys and your left thumb under the flute covering the B flat key. Your left palm should be facing you. <br>  <br>  Step5  Place your right hand on the top of the flute resting your right fingers on the remaining keys and your right thumb under the flute. <br>  <br>  Step6  Sit on a chair with your back straight and your arms in the air holding the flute up in front of you. <br>  <br>  Step7  Breathe into the flute by blowing over the mouth piece until you make a sound.

iNXqiDIYaa	growing up in 1920s china<br>  <br>  this is a customer review from amazon<br>  <br>  A really remarkable book. Jean Fritz is author of many an exciting children's biography. If you've read "Why Don't You Get a Horse, Sam Adams?" or "Can't You Make Them Behave, King George?" then you know her works already. Turning her talents towards a slightly more recent history, Fritz takes a good long look at her own life. Having grown up in China in the early 1920s, this is a story of a child trying to discover where she fits in.<br>  First of all, you have to admire Fritz's candor. The very first thing she does is state in the Forward that she considers this a fiction. Though the facts are true here and there, the author has taken some liberties with time and memory. She obviously cannot remember everything that happened perfectly, so she has filled in the gaps as best as possible. Though, she points out, "it does not feel like fiction to me. It is my story, told as truly as I can tell it". THANK YOU, Jean Fritz. How many books do we read where the author claims that everything within the book is the whole truth and nothing but the truth, while taking wild leaps in narrative and interpretation? Finally, we have an author that admits that much of this book may be considered fiction, though she herself remembers it as fact. Such honesty is admirable, and exceedingly rare in non-fiction writers.<br>  <br>  As for the story itself, Fritz is very good at what she does. The writing here is superb. Living in a very sketchy time in China's history, little Jean was in the unfortunate position of living in a country where foreigners were finally not being tolerated with much kindness any longer. Often times Chinese peasants rail against Jean for being the kind of "foreign devil" that is a bane to their country. Fritz never condemns these people, and even makes note at the back of this book the reasons behind their dislike and distrust. China was a country that was continually being divided into smaller and smaller pieces by the invading colonists. Neither does the character of Jean ever forget that the servants who work for her are human beings as well. Her parents often do fall into the master-servant manner of thinking, a fact that Jean objects to. They do not learn much about the world in which they live. They instead attempt to recreate their own American lives in a foreign land. But Jean knows that there are aspects of Chinese life that she vastly prefers to the life of her parents. The fact that she recognizes this is impressive. The fact that she can relay it years after the fact in this book, is astounding.<br>  <br>  If I have any objections to this book at all they are directed not at the author, but at the illustrator. Margot Tomes has her points. She is not necessarily a bad illustrator. But in this particular book her pictures are superfluous and unnecessary. Sometimes they even touch upon the offensive without really going there. While Fritz never condemns the native Chinese for their opinions, Tomes draws them looking sneaky or sordid at inappropriate times. One such example is in a scene where Jean's servants feed her cat outside, not knowing she's around. The scene in the book is rather touching. Until this time, Jean was half afraid her cook was trying to poison the family. Knowing him to be a person capable of caring for her cat (as he says, "A cat is a cat. There are no foreign cats, no Chinese cats, no capitalist cats, no Communist cats. Just cats") she no longer fears his food. Yet the picture accompanying this text shows a shifty eyed servant peering suspiciously over his shoulder as the cats eats. Unnecessary. Somewhat offensive.<br>  <br>  Fritz ends this book with a series of photographs displaying her family, friends, and where she lived in China. Combined with the book, these serve as an excellent document about a time little recorded in either adult or children's fiction. Using a unique perspective culled from her own life, Jean Fritz has written one of the most interesting books about the Chinese/American experience existing today. It is an honorable and impressive piece of work.

If they're overexposed just a little, they will be blown out.<br>  <br>  Having said that, you must also be aware that your camera's light meter will set the exposure so that the overall scene will have the brightness of a gray card with 18% reflectance. What this means in simple terms is that it will try to make the clouds gray. You must overexpose the shots. However, as I mentioned, this brings you close to blowing them out.

6DMf7wrHaa	The speech made by Mark Anthony that begins 'Friends, Romans, Countrymen lend me your ears.' Anthony uses the words to turn the opinion of the crowd without actually criticising any of the conspirators, in fact he calls them 'all honourable men.' The result is that the crowd believe what he is saying. The power of words is formidable when used correctly.

UsTyc0oeaa	The only way to know for sure would be to send your resume to the school districts that you're interested in teaching in.  Since you already have a degree, even if not in one of the sciences, you probably already meet the requirements to be a substitute teacher, which is a good way to prove yourself to school administrators.  If you want to become a full time teacher (and God knows we need more GOOD ones), then use this time to pursue a full degree in education.  Since you've already earned one degree, you've proved that you can do it.  Check and see what credits you have can be applied to an education degree.  You may find that you don't need much more to get a degree to become a teacher.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|O05HQLohaa	States have different laws regarding what it takes to get a teaching certificate (license to teach in public schools)<br>  Most states require and education degree.  It could be music education, art education, drama education, general education etc.<br>  Few states will allow certification without the education part of the degree.|`|oAkhoCQ6aa	While not every school requires one, most schools require an Education degree that specializes in the field you wish to teach. In other words if you want to teach math, you  need a Math Education degree, Science, a Science Education  degree, etc. Now, of course everyone can come up with examples of I know someone who only had this degree or whatever, and many schools, finding themselves undermanned will lower their standards and accept someone with, say, an art degree, to teach, say, English, but that is not the preferred process. <br>  I spent three years in the Education degree obtaining an emphasis in English where I obtained this understanding of the process. It's possible you can become a generalized teacher with a degree in theater, but you'd have to find a school that is willing to hire people without actual Education degrees. You'd have a better chance at teaching drama however. But You'll still have the same problem if you don't have an education degree.|`|5kK2f9Utaa	I'm not 100% sure but I'm in the process of getting my teaching degree now. I know that if you can, you will definitely have to become certified and take the test for it.|`|ZYyzCeoeaa	Yes but you need to get a teaching degree majoring in theatre which takes 2 years.
xxzamXWoaa	Jay Gatsby (James Gatz)<br>  Gatsby is, of course, both the novel's title character and its protagonist. Gatsby is a mysterious, fantastically wealthy young man. Every Saturday, his garish Gothic mansion in West Egg serves as the site of extravagant parties. Later in the novel, we learn that his real name is James Gatz; he was born in North Dakota to an impoverished farming family. While serving in the Army in World War I, Gatsby met Daisy Fay (now Daisy Buchanan) and fell passionately in love with her. He worked briefly for a millionaire, and became acquainted with the people and customs of high society. This, coupled with his love of Daisy, inspired Gatsby to devote his life to the acquisition of wealth. <br>  <br>  Tom Buchanan<br>  A brutal, hulking man, Tom Buchanan is a former Yale football player who, like Daisy, comes from an immensely wealthy Midwestern family. His racism and sexism are symptomatic of his deep insecurity about his elevated social position. Tom is a vicious bully, physically menacing both his wife and his mistress. He is a thoroughgoing hypocrite as well: though he condemns his wife for her infidelity, he has no qualms about carrying on an affair himself.

uOwpQV5Zaa	I went en pointe around 10 or 11 yrs old, as do/did most of the girls at the studios that I have taken/taught at.  However, some were older (probably about your age).  It all depends on the strength in your ankles.  I will not let a student get pointe shoes if they aren't strong.  If they are close and the rest of the class gets them, I make sure they stay at the barre, so they don't hurt themselves but gain the strength they need.  Good Luck!!|`|id1Miha4aa	Yes, it is.<br>  I went on pointe when I was 12, but it depends on the way your foot develops.<br>  At my studio, we take a pre pointe class that helps develop our muscles before our teacher decides we are ready for pointe.<br>  So yes, it is normal.|`|Ypd3hOhkaa	you are defiantly not too old to go on pointe I was the same age as you and although you are allowed to go on pointe around age 10 and 11 I think it is healthier for your feet when you are a bit older!! x x x hope this helped!!<br>  xxx|`|rrpTvQVkaa	It all depends on where your studio is.

When you are younger than 10 it is dangerous to go en pointe because your body isn't fully developed and it is much easier to be seriously injured.

When you've managed to almost forget it, pick it up and read it again, this time with a slightly older and less-prejudiced eye. Look for errors and problems and be willing to take criticism. Read a lot between now and then (not YA trash like Twilight and Gossip Girl, but real lasting works of literature) to get a handle on what exquisite writing is, and how to form your own style from it (but not copy it).<br>  <br>  Sarah: Don't be an idiot.

Ow3O7h4caa	If you can't afford a top notch guitar, get the Epiphone if you love the fat blues, rock sound.<br>  Epiphone is a good guitar and like I told many of my students, the guitar will NOT make you play better. The musician is in control and any guitar, will only sound as good as you can play.<br>  <br>  I have a number of old LP Gibsons And Fender Strats... I had the occasion to try Les Paul Epiphone model and the guitar sounded pretty good for the money and lots of sustain on the high end. To prove a point, when I enter music store and try Epiphone,  I turn my back and customers are always fooled in thinking i was playing the real deal Gibson.<br>  So, if you love the instrument, Epiphone will serve you well. You decide how it sounds and plays, not the guitar.<br>  Squier isn't bad but has a tinny sound and doesn't compare to Epiphone.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|fMfBAgOUaa	Neither. They are both pretty low quality. If you need something cheap, get a budget Ibanez.|`|KBBonf97aa	They're both good guitars for the price, so you should probably just get the one that feels most comfortable when you play it.  The Squier will have a thinner neck than the Epiphone, so if you've got small hands or haven't played much, that might be a consideration.  I've owned both Fenders and Epiphones for years and neither has given me a moment's trouble.  I play the Fenders when I'm looking for a cleaner sound (though I can mix it up with effects) and the Epiphone when I want some crunch.  They're both really great playing guitars.
bR4BgFLlaa	Art Deco was a popular international design movement from 1925 until 1939, affecting the decorative arts such as architecture, interior design, and industrial design, as well as the visual arts such as fashion, painting, the graphic arts and film. This movement was, in a sense, an amalgam of many different styles and movements of the early 20th century, including Neoclassical, Constructivism, Cubism, Modernism, Art Nouveau, and Futurism. Its popularity peaked in Europe during the Roaring Twenties and continued strongly in the United States through the 1930s. Although many design movements have political or philosophical roots or intentions, Art Deco was purely decorative. At the time, this style was seen as elegant, functional, and modern. Art Deco experienced a decline in popularity during the late 30s and early 40s, and soon fell out of public favor. It experienced a resurgence with the popularization of graphic design in the 1980s. Art Deco had a profound influence on many later artistic movements, such as Memphis and Pop art. Surviving examples may still be seen in many different locations worldwide, in countries as diverse as the United Kingdom, Spain, Cuba, the Philippines, Romania and Brazil. Many classic examples still exist in the form of architecture in many major cities. The Chrysler building, designed by William Van Alen, is a classic example of this, as it is one of the most notable examples of Art Deco architecture today.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|vtNg6bgwaa	maybe, if you have to make some kind of art decoration, you can do this:<br>  you take either a cool piece of fabric or scrap booking paper & you tape/hot/glue/staple it to a piece of gator board then put it into a thick brimmed frame.  it's a really good accessory for a blank wall!  hope this helps a little.  oh, and the definition of art deco is:  A decorative and architectural style of the period 1925–1940, characterized by geometric designs, bold colors, and the use of plastic and glass.|`|C5t4Yp0taa	google it lol

Now if he askes you ok well then how is there a god. Well that answer no body knows because well it doesnt say it in the bible and we jsut have to wait till we get to heaven to ask god that. I have always wondered that too but like i said we have to wait. Basically there is life because god decided it and we are all on this earth so we can get to heaven. We are all being judged by god. I like to look at life as a good thing and try to make the best of life. I mean life would be so much more pleasant to live on if everyone was respectful and considerate of everyones feelings. But unfortionatly not everyone is like that.

79YQAbSRaa	I suggest starting with Carrie and working your way to his most recent ones.  You get to see how his talent develops.<br>  <br>  If that's not your style,  for scary, creepy and easy to follow, I'd go with Salem's Lot, Cujo and Misery.|`|cciB0SmBaa	Morgan,<br>  <br>  I would highly recommend The Talisman by Stephen King. It's a fantasy novel about a boy named Jack who can flip from one dimension to another by taking a sip of wine. He finds out later on that he really doesn't need it. The Talisman is in the other dimension, which holds the key to saving his sick mother's life. In his travels he meets some strange characters. <br>  <br>  You'll love this book. One of his best friends in the parallel world is a werewolf who goes by the name Wolf. <br>  <br>  I just recommended this to another YA person. <br>  <br>  Happy reading.<br>  <br>  PJ M|`|qDSvOOwBaa	I would suggest Needful Things as it's about greed and compulsion and fits in to today's world really well. I have very little time to read fiction but this work has really stuck with me. The characterization is just splendid and somehow I was left with the feeling that the devil's voice is sweet to here. Also, the "Needful things" he gives you are sweet as well-for a little while anyway.<br>  <br>  s_e_s|`|ewd9n2lRaa	CUJO - I read it in high school & did a book report for it freshmen year.

Its a seven book master piece. It in my opinion it is kings best work but if your not into being completely addicted my other suggestion is the stand, which is stephen king's most popular book. There is also Salem's lot but that's a little scary so my top suggestion would be the Dark Tower Series and then the stand hope i helped|`|331512b4169f8467fd51d17e965e5784aa	I adore Bag of Bones by Stephen King.

Nd6uItCDaa	whatttttttt???????????????????<br>  Fanfiction.net is like the best site for that!<br>  See if you can get it unblocked.
rHrZOSc7aa	They look about the same on the site. The only major difference is the adjusting screws. If I had to pick between the two, I would say go with the 102 because its adjusting screws are top mount and that is the kind which are on the step up Armstrong models.<br>  <br>  But if you don't have to get and Armstrong flute, I recommend you try to get a yamaha flute or gemeinhardt flute. They are more trusted brands in my opinion. Armstrong is okay, but yamaha and gemeinhardt are the best quality you can get for a cheaper price, in my opinion of course. :) <br>  (I believe this because I have played Armstrong, Selmer, Gemeinhardt, Symphony, Jupiter, Haynes(haynes is amazing but expensive) and Yamaha flutes before)<br>  <br>  good luck!
15b68e83c3ef9d01d0153600c96e7fe3aa	It's not likely that an artist, painting on canvas, answering in the YA section for artist who paint on canvas, would know the answer to your question. Try asking it in the right section of YA.<br>  <br>  However, I can tell you that there is not now, nor has there ever been to my knowledge, any real animal with the scientific, biological first name of 'DATEOZAURUS.' The name is a made up name by someone, probably for a work of fiction, or perhaps as a joke or a punchline. But it's not the real name of any real animal.

j4P72PsBaa	Helios, the Greek god who drove the chariot of the sun, had a son, Phaeton, by a human mother. With the rashness of youth, Phaeton tricked his father into letting him drive the chariot. The horses instantly bolted, scorching everything in their path with the sun's heat.<br>  <br>  The butterfly-winged female figures are personifications of the seasons and hours. They react in terror as the earth below bursts into flame. Even the great astrological bands that arch through the heavens are disrupted.<br>  <br>  To save the universe from destruction, Zeus, king of the gods, threw a thunderbolt, represented here by a blinding shaft of light. As the chariot disintegrates Phaeton plunges to his death.<br>  <br>  Rubens painted The Fall of Phaeton in Rome. The powerful movement and complex poses were influenced by works of Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, and Michelangelo. The lighting reveals Rubens' attention to Venetian artists as well. Rubens continued to work on the painting over a number of years. Very likely he found the subject—which warned of the need for personal restraint and responsibility—congenial to his own philosophical beliefs.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|9Xd1XGTlaa	your mom

NBBRWd5Gaa	think of a kite.  you let out enough string so that it would fly higher but you don't want to let out too much or the string will loose tension and the kite will come crashing down.  conflict is like the string, necessary to keep the relationship going but will hurt it if you get carried away. the good thing is, with practice, you will eventually know how to keep that kite in the air.  at least this is how i prefer to think of it.  <br>  <br>  if you don't know when enough is enough YOURSELF then perhaps you've also had your fair share of being the fire starter?  i think criticisms and conflicts are necessary to a degree because it shows that at least one party involved still cares about the relationship; if i didn't care about a person i wouldn't bother starting an argument with them in the first place. instead i'd say with a smile, fine, they wanna be that way then let them be that way, i really don't give a rat's behind either way.  i think the dividing line in a conflict is to know when to carry it far enough to convey that you still care about your partner, but not too far as to push them away.  like someone else mentioned, half of that is in the choice of words you use.  the rest is about keeping a cool and calm head, and being mindful of your goal, which is coming to a mutually agreeable solution.|`|kfWi9ZkEaa	Marriage (and love affairs past that first flush) go through a power battle.  It's like a cold war.  This is for the staking of claims of territory.<br>  <br>  We have something called 'matrimonial power' and if we do not use it, the relationship goes right down the kertufflepouffe.  People do not agree all of the time.  People do not always know how to be sensitive to each other.  There are complaints always, because the two cogs do not immediately mesh in synch perfectly.<br>  <br>  Consequently a certain amount of rubbing the sharp edges off each other must take place.  This is what conflict is.  <br>  <br>  And we do this by criticising the other's actions.  "I wish you hadn't said 'x' at that party last night!  It made me look like a 'y'."<br>  <br>  The line exists between negotiating space, and personal attack which brings no positive solution.  Ie it is not constructive to criticise the shape of someone's toes.  They are not in a position to change it, you knew their toes were like that when you met them; and it serves no practical purpose.  Criticism is a morally bound and limited action.  It should be fair, it should not be gratuitous, it should have a positive purpose and it should be capable of achieving its aim.  Without those provisos it's a form of psychological abuse.<br>  <br>  There you go.  Simple line really: fair play.  "Don't do that" is fine;  "you slimy prat you're pure turgid bat's piss" is not.  <br>  <br>  oh: one more.  You must not accuse someone of something they cannot defend themselves against. Therefore you may not attack their motivations, their desires, their aims.  These things are private to them, they cannot lay out evidence of their innocence and an attack in these areas is a serious breach of faith.<br>  <br>  Think that's everything.|`|jDf4pcY6aa	Be yourself.Consider other people's feelings but when it comes down to it if you can't be honest with the person you are with then it's not worth it.Criticism and conflict can be good and bad for a relationship.The best thing to do is talk through your problems.When you can't find a compromise and you argue all the time that is when it's not worth it.|`|DC4Civrvaa	Constructive criticism is good for everyone.  We need to know what we do wrong in order to be able to correct it. I always say that it's not what you say but how you say it.  Conflict isn't necessary "good" for relationships but it will happen.  You just need to know how to deal with it in a positive manner.|`|r2P6PtAOaa	It can be good or bad. If it's necessary, it's a good thing. It's always a good thing to work out problems--it will eliminate or alleviate them and make your relationship better whereas no conflict would eventually be worse because you'd have hidden problems.<br>  <br>  However, if there are no problems, don't turn things into problems. I have some friends I've never fought with for 12 years and we're good friends. It doesn't mean we have to fight, we're fine not fighting.<br>  <br>  So it all depends on whether:<br>  <br>  1. Conflict would result in a better situation/solution<br>  2. You need to call out problems/if there are problems|`|cGbxP589aa	There should be plenty of communication to begin with to avoid conflicts.

Incompetence is not good and you need good to satisfy.|`|srUuoCwcaa	They are neither necessarily "good" or "bad" in and of themselves; they are, however, necessary components in a healthy relationship.<br>  <br>  Spouses/partners who avoid conflict at all costs do so at their own peril. Conflict and tension are normal parts of friendships, romantic involvements, and life in general. By effectively (and courteously) communicating sentiments of dissatisfaction, resentment, discontentment, etc., one is not only achieving a sort of catharsis in doing so but is also implicitly calling for a mutually beneficial solution.<br>  <br>  If no conflicts ever occur, and no complaints were ever voiced, then in all likelihood the end result will be a one-sided relationship with both ends feeling that their mutually independent viewpoints and feelings can never be truly validated within the context of said relationship. Breakups, divorces, parting ways--whatever you call it, lack of communicate (even of those less "pleasant" matters) is their cause more often than not. <br>  <br>  In life and love, some friction is essential. It is the ONLY way to ever find oneself in a happy, committed relationship between mutually satisfied individuals. That is not to say it is some idealistic, universal answer--but it is certainly key, and always a step in the right direction.<br>  <br>  (And no, there shouldn't be a hard-and-fast answer.)|`|uyQXdKLiaa	Don't ever in your life think that people want to hear he truth. They want to hear what they want to hear. Naivety is a precious commodity. Sometimes though, the inexpedient truth can be beneficial. It is a delicate act to give someone as much of what they want to hear while giving them the hard truths when it is absolutely necessary. This is what love is - The drive to try to put forth the effort to keep this delicate act going. The drive to help someone without losing their affection.|`|ZtGEyNJVaa	it is my observation that we tend to enter into relationships based on expectations that arise from our own personal experience growing up. that is... we tend to follow our parents lead such as abuse in relationships lead us to seek to form abusive relationships.<br>  an excellent source of material regarding this idea is the book "Families and how to survive them" by Robin Skynner and John Cleese|`|BpcJBMJGaa	Of course it is very healthy

2KFf4iXcaa	The old chestnut of "Actions speak louder than words comes to mind" but in all honesty there is some validity to what you say.<br>  <br>  Actions are proof of the deeds you do. However your motivations, your intentions also count. Lets say you go to get on a bus, and the person behind you is strapped for cash. You in your kindness pay for there trip. However, you may have intended to pay for them from the goodness of your heart, maybe feeling a surge of empathy. You might however pay for there fare because you want to look like a hero and boost your image. Or in a third option the person is attractive and you want to get there number. What I am saying is that the action itself is charitable, but the reasoning may taint it.<br>  <br>  The last point was rather irrelevant but is related to the next. Lets say that you have led your life with intentions only, have remained in a dead end job and you feel that pang of regret. Maybe for you, you have not confirmed your desires at all and those dreamy feelings have no solidarity to them. If however you had achieved certain desires, you could tell yourself that you had at least done something.<br>  <br>  However if you have done the things you have wanted to do for the wrong intentions you may yet again regret doing them. You might do a university course on the basis that you would get a good education and then later in life when you do a certain job you hit a mid-life crisis. The thing you are doing isnt what you had intended to do in life at all, not even ballpark.<br>  <br>  However if your life has been one where the things you have done have been things of merit and passion, then thats great. It is however relative to what you feel vs what other people have done. Im not saying that you should judge yourself entirely on an equal basis. Basically the relative part is there so that you don't feel deluded. An example would be collecting all 100% of all items on spyro the dragon. While this is an achievement it isnt great compared to something like getting a good education. A good education is more relevant to the world then spyro the dragon is but then again that is what society says. However the ideal of progress is human and could be considered to be relative to humanity as a whole.<br>  <br>  In short, you need to judge progress by both.|`|L5S6rpI7aa	By saying our progress' do you mean 'progress of the society' or 'individual progress' ? Both are however interlinked. Parameter of judging individual progress vary from man to man, some may judge it in monetary term, some may judge it by his achievement of individual aspiration. Then again, progress may be economical or spiritual, cultural or technological. I call it a 'true progress' when people of our society are able to live firmly, without fear, keeping his head high. I judge our progress in it's true meaning with this parameter.|`|90faa4cd94ef7f4fc6117ba415c52a62aa	we are never the judge of our progress , its alwayz our actions backed by good intentions to reach a higher level . its alwayz people who judge you and declare about our progress .|`|9TsiMhp6aa	Do not restrict the question.

It really does come down to how we feel about our lives, but we if look at things over the long haul, we can come to conclusions about whether our lives are better or worse than in the past.  If we have less money but better relationships with our wife, family and friends, have we make progress?  I'd say so.  If we have done our best to put a bit more love into the world, have we made progress?  I'd say so.  If we are grateful for what we have, have we made progress?  I'd say so, but, ultimately, we are the person who decides.  Best wishes to you!|`|fmHyfVmVaa	I have many a good intention that blew up in my face as well as many a action I believed was good.

A set also makes it easier to create light and dark values in your drawings by choosing the right pencil to fill a good-sized area or make a fine line.
yOK32PM9aa	They would consider the hedonic or utilitarian calculus - that is, whether putting it there would lead to a surplus of pleasure over pain, or vice versa.  They would look at the amount of suffering caused by people committing suicide there (suffering caused to relatives, bystanders, emergency workers and possibly even the suicides themselves) and see whether this could be eliminated or decreased by the barrier.  If it could, they would then look at the pain/pleasure caused by erecting the barrier: the tax burden, the aesthetic damage, etc.   Then they would choose the option which caused the greatest surplus of pleasure over pain.|`|BjyXKFpRaa	If it was me I will chose THE GOLDEN GATE.
eezP5wQ2aa	...you don't know what happiness is you're looking for...|`|LjsRfaskaa	Happiness is available to everyone without a lengthy search. All it takes is the decision to not be unhappy. We have full control, we don't have to be like thistle seeds blowing in the wind. Refuse to be unhappy, Simples.|`|2hAuIg5baa	because if you never stop looking for happiness youll never be happy  with what you have, and take for granted the simple things!<br>  so basically stop looking for something more or better and appreciate what you have :)|`|ead05986610bd3aee9f8b22328f904ddaa	Happiness is so fleeting and abstract, as to be impossible to own. Therefore it cannot be a goal to be achievable, as might be a real and existing object. It will help greatly to be realistic and enjoy the happy moments that life let us savor from time to time. Besides happiness is only a state of mind, which could be more plentiful, if we keep a positive and an optimistic attitude. But it is definitely not a reachable permanent state worth to be pursued, unless we like to punish our self with a life of total frustration.|`|iRaVPifQaa	It probably means that if you activeley go pursuing happiness you won't find it maybe because you set your standards for happiness too high and so it won't live up to your expectations and that alot of the time true happiness can come from unexpected sources when we aren't even looking for it.|`|qPDnxTE0aa	True happiness comes from within yourself.<br>  <br>  Chasing things that "make you happy" (i.e. money, wisdom, etc...) only brings a form of happiness for a short time. Thus, a true happiness will never be achieved.|`|ifeoAZwFaa	The closes one to answering that question is Giovanni.   I will give my opinion on this but keep in open mind?<br>  <br>  You cannot pursue happiness.  Why?  You cannot pursue what you do not know and what you are chasing for is just pleasure which can be called happiness. Happiness is a conditioned answer that comes from the environment that says, you must be this way.  Unfortunately, when people say, you should be happy, it is tied to ideas of doing in which you have to find something that will make you happy.  A cause, a stimulus that trigger happiness.  All activities are great the first time you try them but they end up being boring after awhile.  Happiness does not stick around because happiness, as a said earlier, is pleasure and pleasure can only be maintained for moments before its over.  There is nothing that will help anyone to maintain a state of happiness (pleasure) but by trying to find new and ongoing activities to keep you aroused.  Anyone who sets their life up for this would ultimately never have a content life because there life is too based on what they do without understanding how they are like the mad dog chasing its own tail.|`|7dad943aeb0eea9ef53ff4446976257baa	Happiness is, IMHO and I join a very eminent group of people here, a state of being. At the very heart of the pursuit of happiness is understanding what happiness is. To understand happiness you must understand yourself and be content with where you fit in the scheme of things. To continue to pursuit happiness takes you away from the inner peace and stillness which will reveal true happiness.<br>  <br>  It is like a relationship with God, be still and listen and God is.<br>  <br>  If you require a more academic answer then there is an excellent article with cross references in Wikipedia under 'Happiness'.|`|es9jaXWXaa	happiness isn't something that you find like a toy in the cereal box... if you want happiness then ur not happy but if u don't even try to do something to make you happy then it'll come to you when you least expect it|`|cGbxP589aa	I really don't know. Maybe it's referring to how happiness is immaterial?<br>  <br>  Perhaps it's just some nonsense.<br>  <br>  ...Maybe it's not.

By challenging your brain to view things from a positive perspective, by exercising regularly your brain can produce more Dopamine, epinephrine,  and other "happy hormones" and by staying in touch with who you are and being true to yourself...You can become a very happy person just by working on your attitude and your environment...If you don't believe me...ask to your cognitive psychologist of choice!...:D<br>  <br>  Monik.|`|LjsRfaskaa	Don't need to learn something you already know. Being happy is either a fleeting moment, a fragment out of a mostly mundane existence. Or you can simply decide to be happy regardless. Smile, try it on for size. :)|`|yuuvBSKsaa	Happiness is the pleasure generated in the mind when it perceives you have been successful.<br>  <br>  You don't 'lean' happiness.  You succeed & your brain makes you happy.|`|2hAuIg5baa	to me happiness is pure inner peace with yourself, the world, or whatever, and i think it can be learned with age and the more you understand yourself|`|AA11219693	I believe happiness is a decision that you make, a decision that you make every morning, each evening, and at some good time during the day, as whenever you tot up the yield of your efforts. You can learn to happiness, yes, but the only way you could, would be by the acts of your choices. You could see for instance that the last choice you made took you away from happiness, then next time you make a different, a better informed, one to ensure happiness. I do not see if there is any other method whereby one could be happy, if not by means of actual succeeding. <br>  <br>  This then follows further to suggest that happiness in fact is what accompanies success, i.e. each time you succeed in your objectives you feel happy, as success is in fact a consequence of your own good choices. Then I say this again, that, there, I do not see, any other means, or method, whereby one could substantiate happiness, which in general remains illusive in the mind, but by the means of actually succeeding in life, and by actually making things happen.|`|MyVtwtOnaa	I don't believe in happiness per se.  I believe in having inner peace: being happy with who you are, what you want in life, knowing your identity.  There are times of great joy in life, and there are times of great suffering.  We can't be happy all the time.  All we can ask for is inner peace and being comfortable with what we are.<br>  <br>  "The most terrifying this is to accept oneself completely"--Carl Jung|`|tADSxyqwaa	to me, happiness is holding my little boy, my husband nearby and knowing my family are all safe.<br>  <br>  another thing that gives me peace is sitting in my church being reminddd that even  if i have personal problems, God is watching me and loves me even when i'm not proud of myself for the things i do|`|Pt7UlHzEaa	Happiness isn't learned, it's Discovered.<br>  <br>  You have happiness inside you right now, you just need to discover what makes you happy. <br>  <br>  Happiness to me means being content with my present state.|`|BjyXKFpRaa	You must be happy from within first then start outward.|`|FoIxsunVaa	Happiness is an emotion. Emotions come and go. if you are happy all the time you are psychotic. Since you aren't asking "what is happiness i have never felt it" what you are asking is "How can I make it 12 noon all day?"<br>  <br>  The answer is it would destroy the planet. Constant happiness would destroy your life.|`|0b1bc0d20db45e766b5bd783ee1b2812aa	Yes, Happiness requires work. Many people have a difficult time tolerating happiness. You can learn to tolerate it. <br>  <br>  For me happiness is an over all sense of well-being with some occasional spikes of euphoria and some of sadness.

I'm also reminded of the Buddha, who was protected from real life by his father until his coming of age.|`|oBODPh9Daa	Normally my initial answer would be to totally agree with you. <br>  Yes, life does suck. <br>  It's filled with hate, poverty, death, suffering..<br>  But you know what else? <br>  Life is awesome. It's filled with love, compassion, faith, hope..<br>  It's awesome in the sense that it is filled with endless opportunity. Yes every moment of opportunity is one that could end in failure, but what follows it is another chance. Another chance to be great, to be successful.<br>   Now you may not be happy, everything may seem like it's the worst, but what you have to ask yourself is, 'Do i want to be this way?' <br>  Most people would say no. <br>  Discover this and it can change everything. <br>  Find what makes you happy. I think that's the purpose of life. To search for something that you are passionate about so that when you wake up each morning you'll have something to continue to live for. <br>  Find purpose. <br>  Live with a passion, live for a passion. Because if you don't, who will?<br>  I plan to endure the pain and the suffering that this life has to offer. I also plan to hope for the good in life, and if i were to die tomorrow i would know that I have lived a full and happy life because I have seen the good it has to offer. And to me it was worth it. <br>  I have believed in possibility. <br>  I have been loved by others. <br>  And I hope that you can see the same as well. <br>  Life is what YOU make it. Make it worth it.|`|YmtNel5haa	If life didn't suck we would not learn anything.<br>  the fact that life sucks is an overgeneralization, and only how you are feeling at this moment.<br>  Stop feeling sorry for yourself and do something about it.|`|oiNkygNtaa	good f*cking question, i wish i knew!|`|7dad943aeb0eea9ef53ff4446976257baa	Cause you left the window open?<br>  <br>  Bored - How does that song go "let me walk you through the streets of London and I will change your mind"? Instead of the streets of London I would walk you through your nearest slum, down alleys past the homeless and then instead of expounding your judgment I would ask you to listen to their stories. Too harsh for you! The go to an old age care centre when many of the old have been dumped and share their stories.<br>  <br>  Hate life? Then find out what exactly you don't like about it - study it, understand it and change it if you still think it needs changing.|`|LUY72MMYaa	Life sucks because it is hard and challenging, and sometimes the good times can be few and far between.  What we have to do is look for the good stuff between the suckage, I think.  <br>  My life sucks because I am broke, fat and getting old every day I sit in my horrible little cubicle waiting to die.<br>  <br>  But my life also rules because I have friends who make me laugh, a beautiful daughter and good books to read.|`|7383feb0b94e5ed2f02cbd39e60f9f2caa	Life sucks because you have talked yourself into believing it does. Still it is true that collectively the world does "suck." This is due to the fact we are all little children trying to play God. We hurt each other, use each other, and rape each other daily to reach our own agendas. Still for every scar we cause someonelse, we leave a scar on ourselves. Other people are only extensions of ourselves, we are all connected. Every time we acknowledge wrong, we worsen the world. So my advice is, if life sucks, go out and make a difference in your community. Change life for the better, for all of us!|`|SDiYtubGaa	If you think it is full of emotional trauma now, you are certain to think of beautiful and subtle emotions some other day.

1e4622c41080edcef755ae0f3f517e48aa	I think the distinctions are a little more fuzzy than you're making them out to be.<br>  <br>  After all, it is a very easy matter to find examples of people who have been beaten to death simply for 'looking gay' (if there is such a thing), hanging out at a gay bar, or just declaring that they are attracted to other men.  These homophobes are not following folk around to make sure they're having sex... they are so opposed to the mere concept of a gay person that they want them gone or dead.  Which seems to be VERY like a number of racists, wouldn't you say?<br>  <br>  Likewise, a racist might easily re-brand his hatred in a behavioural sense.  And you did see this if you look at historical accounts.  People might say, "I don't have a problem with black people, as long as they stay in Africa where they belong."  Obviously the Confederate south didn't even want to get rid of black people... they just wanted them to 'know their place'.  And I don't think you'd suggest that this wasn't racism, so again we're pretty much back to where we started.<br>  <br>  If the standard is really to love the 'sinner' and hate the 'sin', then why does ANY religion disallow homosexual priests and leaders?  They don't outright disallow ones who have commited other crimes and sins.  Why the double standard if what you say is true?|`|AA11564934	Yes I understand the distinction, but you are missing a point.<br>  <br>  WHy do you care what 2 people do behind closed doors?  If a hetero couple has anal sex, or oral so what?  What's the difference?  It's still bigotry.|`|xNkmK0SHaa	Your basic premise is faulty thereby giving your "question" a lack of logic.<br>  <br>  Homosexuality is not a sin; promiscuity is.<br>  <br>  Much recent research indicates that homosexuality is a genetic condition, not a moral one.<br>  <br>  Homophiobia, racism, and sexism are indicative of personalilty disorder(s).|`|zxhppf3Caa	Is someone homosexual only if they engage in sexual acts with a member of the same sex? <br>  <br>  Your question is childish and ignorant at best.  At worst, I can't believe you have the nerve to post it in the philosophy forum, when it is full of faulty assumptions, the worst of which assumes that homosexual sex and sex outside of marriage are sins.  Have you actually READ the Bible? Have you considered that your belief system is right for you and not everyone else? <br>  If you want dogmatic, scripture spewing answers you are in the wrong department.|`|L8RVJ4soaa	YES,i understand the distinction.I would agree.except ,using the words : race (were all human) and sin (would suggest a belief in god,which is personal choice not a fact) says that even you have a ways to go .|`|jBIaUfUzaa	i totally agree
WXExyAlWaa	It's unlikely that blood loss would do it from fingers, but pain might depending on the pain tolerance of the victim. Interrogators tried to keep them awake a few different ways, like throwing cold water on them (being the most well-known).

There are also a lot of torture techniques that don't involve blood loss at all, such as water boarding and bastinado.|`|kB63WTfdaa	I wouldnt think so, but it would hurt like %&$#.

GFzDwIk6aa	"The Volturi aren't supposed to be the villains, the way they seem to you. They are the foundation of our peace and civilization."<br>  ―Edward Cullen to Bella Cullen and Jacob Black<br>  <br>  Background:<br>  The Volturi are the equivalent of a royal family to vampires. They operate from the city of Volterra, Italy. The Volturi have existed for at least three thousand years, if not more. They are considered the most sophisticated coven, aside from Carlisle's and Tanya's. However, they do not follow a "vegetarian" diet, as seen in New Moon, in which they capture and murder several humans in a carefully planned "meal". They are considered the de facto royal family of vampires, as they are the largest coven and most influential coven in existence . The Volturi deal swiftly and decisively with anything they consider a threat to their coven, or the vampire world. They destroy anyone who attempts to overthrow them, or resist their authority and, at Caius' insistence, have hunted werewolves (true werewolves, not shapeshifters) to near extinction in Europe and Asia. <br>  <br>  Purpose:<br>  Although they are not the 'official' royal family of vampires, they still act as though they are, and are an incredibly influential coven. They are also considered 'nighttime patrons of the arts'; as, because of their inability to sleep, they study the arts at night. The Volturi act as guardians, keeping the secret society of vampires hidden from the human world as needed. They often send others to travel from Volterra to destroy overzealous covens from exposing vampires by mass eradication of every vampire (and any humans) present. In the Twilight series, the Volturi are becoming an increasing problem, as they want Bella turned into a vampire as soon as possible, while Edward opposes the idea. <br>  <br>  Powers:<br>  The Volturi are known for their amazing and special powers. Jane and Alec, twins and members of the guard, are credited and worshiped for having the most useful powers. Jane can cause someone to believe that they are feeling pain. This excruciating pain makes it easy for the Volturi to attack and destroy their enemies. Alec's powers are also useful when attacking the enemy. He can cut off all senses making the prey unable to see, hear or feel anything, enabling them to kill the victims without a fight. Aro, one of the leaders, can hear every single thought a person/vampire has ever had. The only way he can do this is if he has physical contact. Marcus, also one of the leaders, can sense relationships. Demetri, a member of the guard, is a tracker. He can track a person down once he has the tenor of their mind. He is known as the best tracker in the vampire world. Renata, also a member of the guard is a shield. She shields Aro and stands by his side at all times. She shields physical attacks. When the person/vampire is attacking she repels them by confusing them. They end up going in a different direction and are unaware of what they were doing in the first place. Chelsea, newest member to the guard, can manipulate vampires, who are wanted, to join them in Volterra. They formerly had the services of Eleazar, who could see abilities or potential abilities in vampires and humans, though he left after meeting his soulmate, Carmen. <br>  <br>  History:<br>  The Volturi coven was founded by Aro. When the coven was strong enough, the Volturi usurped control of the vampire world from the Romanian Coven. At some point the Romanian coven tried to regain control, but the Volturi defeated them.<br>  The Volturi have ruled the vampire world for centuries by the start of the series. During that time, they did a number of things to ensure stability in the world, including eradicating the Immortal children and cleaning up after the Vampire Wars in the southern parts of America. At some point, Caius was almost killed in a fight with a werewolf. Becoming terrified of his people's mortal enemies, he pushed the Volturi to hunt them to near extinction in Europe and Asia.<br>  At one time, Marcus and his wife Didyme, who was also Aro's sister, planned on leaving the Volturi. Aro was upset by this, but appeared to give them his support. However, Aro later secretly killed Didmye to prevent Marcus from leaving.<br>  Carlisle, at one time, came to stay with them. The Volturi liked him greatly, but were unable to persuade him to hunt humans instead of animals. Carlisle eventually left, and established his own coven in America. Eleazar also was once part of the Volturi Guard, but left with Carmen. The two later found the Denali Coven and stayed with them. <br>  <br>  Twilight:<br>  Although they don't make any appearances in Twilight, Aro, Marcus and Caius are mentioned by Edward as the inspiration of the gods in several Italian paintings that belong to Carlisle.|`|BZwJeuMGaa	The Volturi would be like the royal family in the vampire world. They keep everything in order, and have certain rules the vampires need to follow. For example; they can't reveal to a human(s) that they are a vampire, or they can be killed. <br>  So basically Edwards risking so much more then we thought by being with Bella. <br>  <br>  WEB DEFINTION: <br>  (doesn't contain spoilers)<br>  The Volturi<br>  The vampire coven known as the Volturi resides in Volterra, Italy. They are regarded as "royalty" by other vampires because they have lived for well over three thousand years and act as police, enforcing the rule that vampires' existence remain a secret from humans. They often send others to travel from Volterra to prevent overzealous covens and renegade vampires from exposing their kind. They are guarded by several powerful vampires who have been recruited for their powers and skills. Carlisle once stayed with the coven as a guest, but left due to his desire to avoid harming humans and established his own coven in the United States. <br>  The Volturi leaders include Aro, who can read every thought a person has ever had once he has made physical contact, Marcus, who senses relationships, and Caius, who has no known power. Aro's wife, Sulpicia, Caius' wife, Athenodora, and formerly Marcus' wife, Didyme, who had the power to make others happy, also act as leaders.[7] The Volturi guard consists of 32 members, including Jane, who creates illusions of pain; Alec, who is able to block the others' senses; Demetri, who can track anyone once he has the tenor of their mind; Chelsea, who can change emotional bondings; and Renata, who can make anyone feel distracted and wandering when they are near her (classified as a "shield"). The majority of the Volturi remain nameless throughout the series. There is also a human secretary named Gianna who appears in New Moon. Despite her hopes to become a vampire, she is killed by the Volturi by the events of Breaking Dawn.[8] The Volturi have invited Carlisle, Edward, Alice to join them, though all have refused.|`|a88b8d410dd47bd737033d0505db95c1aa	The Volturi are the good vampires.  Like Edward says they are like the royalty in the vampire world.  They have been in power for two and a half millenium (2500 years).   They are like to police for vampires and take any one out who threatens to reveal their existence.

kUE3Ddktaa	I know you'd like a quick and easy answer, but it doesn't work like that. You have to do some research about the publisher of the book to find out how they denote first editions.<br>  <br>  Some books do say "First Edition" on the copyright pages. Most don't. But that doesn't mean they aren't first editions. In that case, you should trying doing the following things:<br>  <br>  - check the publisher's website to find out how they use serial numbers (the string of numbers on the bottom of a book's copyright page) to indicate a book's edition<br>  <br>  - do some internet research for identifying features of a first edition of that particular book - if it's a collector's item (very rare or very famous) you should be able to find a description of an authentic first edition<br>  <br>  - visit sites like alibris.com and abebooks.com and search for the titles that you have - see if your book is similar to the first editions described by sellers on those sites<br>  <br>  - have your books appraised by a professional appraiser who specializes in rare books<br>  <br>  You should be aware that the most valuable books are "true first editions" - the first edition of the book published, and the first print run ever to roll off the presses. "Edition" really refers to the content of the book - a first edition is the first way that the book ever appeared in print. Print run refers to the "batches" in which the books were printed - back when printing was expensive, a first print run might contain only a few hundred books, until the publisher could be sure the book would sell. A "first edition, first printing," or true first edition, will usually be more valuable than a first edition from a later print run. Again, doing some research on the particular publisher should help you determine what print run your book is from.<br>  <br>  And here's the bottom line - if the book was published recently, you may have a first edition but it's not valuable. Popular fiction is printed in runs of tens of thousands (sometimes millions) of copies - the only thing they're worth is the price on the cover (less if they've been read already).<br>  <br>  But antique books - especially hardback books from the early 20th century and before - may be valuable to a collector, if they are books that are very rare or are now popular. A first edition of Robert Penn Warren's "All the King's Men" in pristine condition could be worth thousands of dollars. A first edition of some random book that no one cares about may be worth a few dollars to a collector.<br>  <br>  The biggest determining factor of value, aside from rarity, is condition. A dinged-up book missing the dust jacket and with pen marks on the pages is not going to be worth as much as a well-preserved copy.|`|vhFnxBNeaa	no. usually if its the first edition they dont know there will be a second edition already. Check the print date.|`|FA3OvOkcaa	check in the front of the book where the copyrights usually are. If there is more than one date or edition named then it's a newer. if not then it's first edition

Also you need to look at your moral beliefs, which includes religion. What is ethical to one might be unethical to another, it is all in the eyes of the beholder.

However to my mind they come on as being a bit washy washy.|`|SDiYtubGaa	Its better if one chose what is right with individual sense of reason, sense of humanity(in the individual's own limits), and a sense of one's own capabilities and restrictions, and the right thing need not be necessarily obedient to the traditional ethics.|`|djzGlOUjaa	i think that it goes by the law mostly, you cant just do whatever you feel like is right because sometimes it is not. It also helps to think about what you are doing, if you have any doubt that it is not ethically right, it probably isnt and dont do it.

Make sure an instructor tells you to get pointe shoes before you go and buy a pair. Remember, you MUST get fitted for a pair of pointe shoes.

J5zj8dWRaa	No matter where it is, graffiti is destruction of property - so my answer is  "no".  If someone wants to put art on something in view of the general public, they should go through the correct channels to get a permit.|`|dycsTrcraa	Since I don't live there, I can't decide for someone else what they should choose (artistic freedom or clean walls, sidewalks, signs)|`|izA3FWW2aa	I lived in Singapore for a few months and was greatly impressed with the cleanness of the city.  Not as much rubbish laying around and I don't think I even noticed any grafitti.<br>  <br>  To answer your question, graffiti art shouldn't be legal.  There is no argument that graffiti is at times a great art form, but most of us know the majority of people are just tagging walls and signs and it has no real value.  Not to mention if a business wants art on it's wall it can pay to have it done and thus it's not grafitti.   People shouldn't be marking up buildings they don't own no matter how good their art is since art appreciation is subjective.

The fact that the truss rod cover says Gibson is irrelevant,  since it's easy enough to buy a replacement Gibson truss rod cover.

MFF61HvDaa	It was a law that any person heading to the Gold Rush had to carry a minimum of 2000 lbs. of supplies with them. There was a check point where their supplies were weighed before they started. That was because the conditions were so severe, without those supplies many would starve to death.<br>  Many turned around before reaching the gold fields because just trying to get supplies there was too much of a hardship.|`|cR7Sf4cjaa	One of the pioneers of the gold rush was Felix Pedro - an Italian immigrant who discovered gold in the Fairbanks area in 1904 or so.  Google his name - you should find a wealth of information about him and what he went through to mine his discovery.<br>  <br>  You can also search the internet on the '40 Mile Gold District' - an area just east of where Felix discovered his gold and they are still pulling gold out of there today.<br>  <br>  I know this will help.|`|VYCLwKwNaa	The link below is for the Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park. It will tell you what you need to know. <br>  <br>  People from all over the world came to the Klondike because there was a worldwide depression and they had dreams of striking it rich. By the time most of them got there, though, all the good gold claims had been staked. Many moved on from the Klondike into Alaska and found gold there. They built log cabins and had to work very hard. They had to cut wood to heat the cabins, in addition to the work on their gold claims. They had to dig the claims in the winter when the ground was frozen, so it would not collapse on them. They had to carry everything themselves, by sled or on their backs. The people who made the most money were those who brought in food, whiskey, etc.  to sell to the miners. A person who carried a newspaper over the Chilkoot Trail could sell it for a lot of money once they reached Dawson. Dawson became a city of miners, stores and saloons.<br>  The Gold Rush was short, and most people did not stay long.<br>  The people who best adapted to the cold, whether they were gold miners or explorers, were those who learned from the people who were there first, the First Nations people of Canada, the Athabascan, Yup'ik, Tlingit and Inupiaq people of Alaska. Those people had survived in harsh climates for a long time, and knew how to dress to stay warm, where to find food, how to stay safe on the sea ice, etc. People who followed their example did the best.<br>  <br>  Check the link for more information.|`|hSbKTmk4aa	The team from the Natural Environment Research Council and led by Dr Silvia ... settlers came across the Bering Straits, from Russia to Alaska, ...

draNVjbkaa	DON'T LISTEN TO KASEY557! She's giving you very misleading and dangerous information! John Casablancas is a SCAM! Miley stated off at CESD, which is a top notch agency.<br>  <br>  The best agencies for modeling and commercial print are:<br>  Elite<br>  Ford<br>  Wilhelmina (NOT wilhelmina scouting network)<br>  CESD<br>  Osbrink<br>  Abrams<br>  KSR<br>  Coast to Coast<br>  Culbertson Group<br>  Berzon<br>  Allure Modeling and Talent<br>  DDO <br>  Equinox Model and Talent Agency<br>  LW1 Inc<br>  L.A. Models<br>  Morgan Models<br>  NTA Talent Agency<br>  Tag Models<br>  Champagne-Trott/Vision Models<br>  Brand Talent and Model Agency<br>  <br>  John Casablancas, Barbizon, and John Robert Powers are all SCAMS! They are NOT agencies! They MISLEAD people into thinking that they are, but are NOT. LEGIT Agencies only make money when you do (10% for film/tv and commercials, 20% for commercial print). REAL AGENTS DON'T take $2000 upfront and DON'T make you take their subpar classes.<br>  <br>  A school for modeling is the biggest scam, period! When you get picked up by a LEGIT agency like Ford or Elite, they will teach you or hire coaches. They're not going to reject your resume because "oh, you don't have any modeling classes." <br>  <br>  If you don't think they're scams, then go waste thousands of dollars that could go towards good headshots and training from the BEST schools (JRP, JC, and Barb. are NOT the best!) Also, go to a major market like L.A. or N.Y. with those schools on your resume. You'll get LAUGHED out!<br>  <br>  Schools like Barbizon, JRP, and JC still exist because there are a lot of suckers trying to get into acting and for the money. They think that going to one school will be the answer and it's not. It's these schools that give them and feed off of those false promises. For every 100 people that go through these scammy schools and lose their money, there will always be that naturally talented kid that gets work and that these scammy schools take credit for. <br>  <br>  JRP-Banks on the name of a very famous and DEAD agent. They say that Lucille Ball, John Wayne, Barbara Walters, Heather Locklear, Peter Fonda, Jane Fonda, and many other famous actors went to the school, when NONE of them did! Some of those celebs even threatened legal action for using their names. So you see, they use bait and switch tactics.<br>  <br>  John Casablancas-The franchises have been known for unethical business practices and really have nothing to do with the founder's original intentions.<br>  <br>  Barbizon-It was legit back in the 70s and 80s. Now these franchises have been known for unethical business practices and false promises.<br>  <br>  These schools are OVERPRICED and DON'T provide the caliber training that more affordable and REPUTABLE schools like Howard Fine Studios, Ivanna Chubbuck, TVI Studios, Groundlings, Second City, Beverly Hills Playhouse, Stella Adler, William Esper Studios, Tom Todoroff, Joanne Baron/D.W. Brown, Margie Haber, etc. do.<br>  <br>  Go look those schools up! They are all respected by the industry and LEGIT!|`|OHfZFR31aa	First of all, how old is your son? And where do you live?<br>  <br>  If your son is under 10, you really need to be in LA or NY for child modeling.

ce9pMwKMaa	mural art is a great way to show case your stuff.<br>  <br>  turn some ugly barrier fences into a work of beauty.|`|PKwEKfG7aa	Your art is really good. You should probably try and get onto an art course at college.|`|SLve6oO6aa	First, practice.  Go for quantity over quality, because the more you do the better you will get.  Set aside time every day to do art, and keep up with it religiously.<br>  <br>  Second, maintain your portfolio(s).  Date AND SIGN everything you do, make scans or take digital pictures every time you finish a piece.  You may need more than one portfolio, depending on the kind(s) of work you do and the market you want to tap.  The point here is to make sure that if someone calls you tomorrow, you have RIGHT NOW samples of the work they want to see to hire/accept you for...whatever.  Commissions, galleries, shows, etc.<br>  <br>  Third, identify what you want to do, and create a business card to relect that.  Then go out and identify where you can get your name out there--ALWAYS TAKE YOUR CARDS AND PASS THEM OUT WHEREVER YOU GO.  <br>  <br>  In looking at your work on Deviant Art, it looks like you mostly do pencil/computer drawings and photography.  I'd say photography is your strong suit, so if I were you I'd go to the library and see what resources they have on photography.  From there, I'd look for other local and/or internet resources.  I'd also practice drawing from my photographs and draw from life.  "Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain" is a GREAT book to help you improve your skills and to give you some insights to the process of drawing.  Borrow it from the library and if it's a good book for you, buy it.<br>  <br>  DEFINITELY join a local art guild/group and see what resources they have for you.  My local art group, 119th Street Artists, is a great resource in terms of both activities and people.  Other artists are your best resource for everything, really.<br>  <br>  If you can make reproductions of your work fairly easily, you should consider getting/sharing a booth at local art fairs/festivals--it's great exposure, IF YOU PASS OUT YOUR CARDS, even if you don't sell much.  Also identify local framing shops to see if they would frame reproductions of your work and display them as examples.  Don't forget coffee houses or galleries in your area--they may display and sell your work for you, too.<br>  <br>  ALWAYS SIGN YOUR WORK AND MARK IT WITH THE COPYRIGHT SYMBOL.  Copyright is immediately yours upon creation of a piece, so mark it clearly so everyone knows who the rockin' artist is. <br>  <br>  Education is optional.  For certain specialized fields you'll need it, but it goes back to #3 on my list:  What do you want to do?
hQ95u9OLaa	My first and I think one of his best is Firestarter. It is extremely satisfying. It is maybe his 2nd best in my opinion.<br>  <br>  His best is Misery. Besides being really spooky, it was the first time that I noticed he had some things to say other than just scary stories. It is about the relationship between writer and reader, the process of writing-take your pick. It is also very satisfying.<br>  <br>  Dead Zone is very good.<br>  <br>  Salem's Lot is excellent too. About inherent evil that lives in a certain place and grows stronger because nobody is there to stop it. And it doesn't have any of this Twilight or Anne Rice stuff. These vampires are the way vampires are supposed to be BAD.<br>  <br>  The Tommyknockers is long but very good; the ending doesn't let you down the way some King epics do like It and The Stand. No offense to those books, I just think Tommyknockers is better.<br>  <br>  Cujo is scary.<br>  <br>  Christine is scary too.<br>  <br>  I would see the movie The Shining, the original Kubrick version, then read the book. There is a world of difference.<br>  <br>  Dreamcatcher is also very good. I really don't like most of his books the way I used to, but it is reminiscent of the old King.<br>  <br>  Now one last book: early King, Night Shift. It is a collection of short stories and some of them were too bad to be up late at night reading for me. The Mangler, Graveyard Shift, Sometimes They Come Back, Jerusalem's Lot, are some of the worst or best. <br>  <br>  Feel free to e-mail me about what you discover. King is really a very good writer and a good horror writer.|`|RWEyZZXWaa	Carrie<br>  The Shining<br>  The Stand<br>  <br>  These are all books that he wrote in the 70's when he was becoming hugely successful.

Jx1GDVF7aa	You may get several answers on this, and most will think their way is the only/best way,...<br>  <br>  if you are replacing a head, the first thing you must remember is to just get the screws finger tight.<br>  next, you tighten in a kind of star pattern (much like when you replace a car tire). This keeps the head from pulling and destroying itself.<br>  <br>  if you want your drum tuned perfectly, the next thing you do is put your left thumb in the center of the head-pressing gently. then tap lightly about an inch in from the rim near each screw/bolt, tightening a little bit after making a complete circuit around the rim.<br>  <br>  lastly; if you don't want over-ring, then you should make sure the batter head is slightly higher in pitch than the snare head,(the difference in sine wave oscillation cancel each other out).

The building, neither a prison nor a hospital, has no walls, no ceiling, no floor: nothing but endless flights of stairs leading nowhere, with no perceivable boundary. On one landing is a basin of running water that serves as a toilet, sink and drinking fountain; on another, a machine with lights that occasionally produces food. Without prior preparation or introduction, the five must learn to deal with the others' widely-divergent personalities, the lack of privacy, their apparent helplessness, and the strange machine that only feeds them under increasingly exacting circumstances.<br>  <br>  One of the protagonists is Peter, a slightly slow boy who tends to follow authority; another, Lola, is a rebellious juvenile delinquent girl. Blossom is a fat, spoiled girl who grew up amidst wealth but who was recently orphaned; Oliver is a handsome, self confident, and arrogant athlete; and Abigail is compassionate but easily misguided and worried about what others think of her.

CDN9M6ZOaa	Yes! Fyeiro is the scarecrow! The wicked witch and Fiyero don't want anyone to know who they are (remember, Glinda loved Fiyero, and Elphie told her that he had died) let alone that she changed him out of love (she didn't want him to die because she loved him.). They were just pretending to hate each other, which is why at the end he came to the trapdoor and they walked out together, they left for wherever it is that they went, we don't know. But the play was originally a book, and that book comes with a sequel that explains some more things. That could help you any further.|`|j7o7RsZKaa	yes... you have to remember that the wizard of oz was written 1st and it doesn't all fit (trust me i hav tried to make it all fit) But she was just keeping the secret from other ppl and she doesn't actualy get him on fire so tht he burns up so its all good|`|AA10981338	Elphie didn't really know that he was the Scarecrow until he showed up after her "death" So she thought he was just a random scarecrow and Fiyero, the best actor, couldn't let her know it would ruin everything.|`|Q08GpskDaa	Yes Fiyero is the scarecrow.

AA10923178	The European powers were seeking raw materials from the underdeveloped lands of North and South America, Africa and Asia. The raw materials were used to stimulate economic development in the European countries. The conquered lands served as markets for the developed nations of Europe with their trained labor forces. This is called mercantilism. The competition between the Eurpean nations, like Spain, Portugal, England, France, Holland, Belgium, and Germany for the most valuable raw materials led to conflicts. An example of this is the series of wars between England and France for North America, ending in 1763. Meanwhile the unplanned growth of industry and large cities in Europe led to slums, poverty, conflicts, and social problems between rich and poor. I hope that this has been a help to you.

According to Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, he died "some fifteen years previously" as seen from the perspective of August 1995. As it is common in the Black family, Regulus is named after a bright star, in this case the brightest star in the constellation Leo. Before publication of the final volume of the series, Rowling stated that Regulus was dead, but did not comment on the nature of his demise. She also remarked in an interview: "Regulus got in a little too deep. Like Draco. He was attracted to it, but the reality of what it meant was way too much to handle." Sirius described him as his parents' favourite son because he accepted their ideas about blood purity. Regulus is sorted into the Slytherin House and played Seeker on its Quidditch team. He joins the Death Eaters at the age of sixteen but later had a change of heart.``<br>  <br>  Please take the time to answer mine :)<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AvW8P7gyQGfCu0e82MDpoEjsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304092040AAMLf74">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|x38sIvyxaa	Mine was Bellatrix.|`|IWaxUqDzaa	Bella......OR Draco!!!!!

Umm, I hated Draco but at least he didn't kill Dumbedore, I dunno, you aren't really supposed to like Death Eaters are you? You are supposed to love to hate them...<br>  wait, I forgot Regulus Black.  he was good, well he was bad at first but then he became good, so he was my favorite i guess<br>  as for Bellatrix, I HATE her! She killed Sirius and Dobby, and was right in Voldemort's inner circle! How could anyone like her? I think her character was great for a DEath Eater, but like she was seriously CRUEL!<br>  At least Molly killed her...|`|Fn5gpDOKaa	I liked Fenrir Greyback, I know he made one of my favorite characters a Werewolf, but that's what made Lupin such good friends with James and Sirius.

And since you stated you've felt them recently, give them time and they may go away.  Because for some reason, I have a feeling that it will. Simply because you express sadness in being the only one in your state of understanding.<br>  <br>  One of the most important things these days is to be able to understand yourself, and in that you will learn to understand other things.|`|OZjlW5utaa	Huh? <br>  <br>  I suppose their understandable because everyone feels at some point in their life that no one understands them.<br>  <br>  edit: You got some mad logic going on there and that was deep, I get you because sometimes I feel that way and I also do a lot of art sometimes.

It's just so much simpler to illustrate my state of mind through words and it works. I believe that most of the most talented artists are simply conveying their thoughts and feelings through their art, which they probably started doing in order to share a piece of themselves with others. <br>  <br>  The best way to relieve yourself of this feeling is to work on improving your skills and continue making art. When I'm feeling really lonely or isolated, I sometimes share my most personal poems or stories with friends to see their response. You feel like you're sharing a very personal and intimate part of yourself which can be liberating, especially when others feel touched by your work (even though it can be kind of embarrassing).|`|o3pqpKGNaa	so what if they don't understand you. you're a unique individual and someone might be just around the corner, that does understand. so keep pursuing your art not as a vent but as breaking down the barriers and communicating to the world how you understand it and eventually someone will get it.|`|aA0Mcivaaa	I KNOW exactly what you are feeling<br>  It is called depression.<br>  <br>  It is not that your friends don't understand you..<br>  <br>  it is that YOU DONT UNDERSTAND YOU<br>  <br>  I have been taking welbrutin for about a year  now<br>  and it seems to be helping me.

We all get down sometimes and start to feel that way.  Some, like my nephew, even have to deal with conditions like Aspergers, a syndrome which causes him to think in different patterns than a lot of other people.  I know he feels misunderstood a lot of the time.  But, even though I might not think in the exact same way, I do understand a lot of what he says and I find it fascinating.  And more importantly, I love him, and am happy to know him.  <br>  <br>  My husband definitely thinks differently than I do, and has a hard time understanding me at times, but I know he loves me despite how sad I get when he doesn't understand me. :)  <br>  <br>  We are all very unique creatures.  None of us ever understand each other completely.  We all feel left out at times. <br>  <br>  You are right in thinking that God does understand you, though.  More importantly, he cares about you.  He has a name, and he wants you to know him.  You might enjoy the points, and the scriptures, brought out in this article entitled "God Really Cares About You" <a href="http://www.watchtower.org/e/20040701/article_02.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtower.org/e/20040701/art...</a><br>  <br>  Don't give up.  <br>  <br>  "For I myself well know the thoughts that I am thinking toward you,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘thoughts of peace, and not of calamity, to give you a future and a hope." - Jeremiah 29:11|`|PR6w9XzAaa	I dont think any human can ever understand someone else completely.

CDN9M6ZOaa	Step 1: Stand in a fighter's stance facing your partner with your feet apart and your knees bent to begin the Jerk dance. Hold your hands so that they are out on either side of your body, with your hands about level with your face. <br>  Step 2: Bend forward with your body toward your partner and turn to your left. As you do so, cross your hands before you at the wrists. The hands should still be held up at the same level. Remember to bob your head forward also as you bend your body. <br>  Step 3: Straighten your body and spread your hands wide again. <br>  Step 4: Lean forward again toward your partner, turn to the center, and cross your hands before you. Bo your head as you bend forward. <br>  Step 5: Raise yourself up straight again, spread your arms wide, then repeat the above steps to the right. <br>  Step 6: Vary the steps by snapping your fingers as you throw out your hands. <br>  Step 7: Check out the dance in a mirror. You should look like a jerky monkey conducting a band. The dance is actually a combination of the popular dance, The Monkey, and sweeping arm gestures.|`|KBPQjK7kaa	jus go to youtube how to jerk tutorial

I think your drama teacher (who I presume auditioned you) will be glad that you didn't just stop; that you were sensible and tried again. I don't think your mistake will go against you because your nerves will be taking into account.<br>  Good luck anyway!|`|KGj1dxhQaa	i don't think it will make a difference. you are older, which is generally a positive, but with so many people who knows. you have just as good a shot as anyone:) and starting over shows whoever picks roles that you realized you messed and that you have good judgment. so good luck!

D9x1QSgiaa	Well....If you have money to blow, you COULD attend a "Modeling School or Academy".....but they are not always what they are cracked up to be. In fact...I would venture to say that MANY of the best, well known professional models have NOT attended a modeling school. The problem is that MANYYYY of them are nothing but a "front" for a photographer or his business. Of course the Modeling School or Academy will insist that all of your photos come from this ONE photographer...so it's all about money, money, money. Many modeling agencies won't ask the model if she was "schooled" by a professional Modeling School or not. <br>  <br>  Since experience is usually more important than schooling, it doesn't really make THAT much difference if he or she was or was not formally trained. I have gotten some excellent results from many of the models I have used who have NEVER attended a Modeling School. Some of the best models are children. They don't have too many bad habits, but they can be impatient at times. Most of the models I have found can do well if they are given 10-15 minutes of coaching and instructions they usually catch on well. <br>  <br>  What is also important in the whole process is your ability to make a GREAT portfolio...that is....a decent album of your best shots in a variety of settings. That includes swimsuit photos, head shots, formal wear, product promotions, you name it. The portfolio must display the model in a variety of settings and backgrounds to display to a potential advertiser that she is versatile and capable of promotion the product or merchandise in the way that best reflects the image of the company and appealing to their clientele. I have used many models who never show their face....so good looks don't ALWAYS carry a lot of weight either. Many times I am taking photos of their hands, back profile or some other body part.<br>  <br>  If you are over age 14-15 you are considered to be "late starter" in THIS business.....many models are starting at around age 12, 13 or 14. If you have waited until age 15 or 16, you have already lost a lot of time on the competitors. Many models are finished by age 28 or sooner.<br>  <br>  I suggest that you find a good photographer who is capable of helping you make a portfolio. Some photographers (such as new photographers or college students) may work with you on what is known as TFP...(Trade for Photos)...in other words.... you sign a Model Release allowing the photographer to use your photos for FREE and he/she supplies a good selection of photos for you to keep (for FREE) in your portfolio. One hand washes the other in this kind of agreement. <br>  <br>  Also....your BEST choice of Modeling Agencies WILL be in the larger cities...New York, Boston, L.A. , San Francisco, Atlanta, Miami, Dallas, Houston, etc.....but I don't necessarily suggest that you move, until you are better established. Also...don't be afraid to post a few photos HERE for us to see as well. Be sure to have an online presence at websites such as:<br>  <a href="http://www.modelmayhem.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.modelmayhem.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.onemodelplace.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.onemodelplace.com</a> <br>  or other such sites. (Do a search on Google.com) <br>  <br>  Making your OWN site featuring YOU (and ONLY YOU) is also a great idea. You need business cards with your face on them and your website address. You'll need to also print flyers with 3 or 4 great shots of you. They need to be mailed to modeling agencies (not the schools), ad agencies, and anyone else you can find who could use you in the promotion of their business in any way. Agencies DOOOO look at these sites from time to time to scout for new talent. Many agencies also conduct what is known as "Open Call"...which is an open door invitation to come and audition and pose for unknown or amateur "model-wanna-bees" with the Modeling Agency. There are probably some decent photographers in the YOUR area or some other nearby larger city.<br>  <br>  I also STRONGLY suggest that you go to: <a href="http://www.newmodels.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.newmodels.com</a> and read everything you see there for more information.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|FeUmyxqqaa	get a portfolio and send it to modeling agents
HUDjXVOyaa	Festivals <br>  Art & Craft Shows<br>  Consignment/Comerical Galleries  <br>  Public Art Galleries (City Centres, good to enter if going into new region)<br>  Artist Collective Galleries (group of artist form their own gallery)<br>  Professional or Personal Website <br>  Selling art directly from your Studio<br>  Local coffee shops or restaurants <br>  Displaying at Doctor or Insurance Offices<br>  Simply set up in a park and paint, people will be drawn to see what your doing. That often results in a sold piece.<br>  <br>  There is nothing more important than location. You need to display your artwork where there is lots of people or trafic flow, also where people are spending sparatically and there is access to Cash machines.<br>  <br>  If you build a your own professional website, a good marketing technique is to link your website up with as many others local and regional art groups or business. The more links your have the higher importance and better Google search results for your webpage.|`|a29d0985a9ef2ce95b81c3794f476a36aa	Artists just starting into the market should use any and all venues to display work. A good start is your local library. You will not be able to sell them but the exposure may bring custom orders or commissions. Most libraries support local talent...it is good exposure for them as well. Once they agree to show your work, call your local paper to place an announcement. The library may promote you but do not count on it. Another beginning venue is a coffee shop. Also, you can approach a card and gift shop but make sure you have the proper support materials ready - resume and artist statement. There is a book that is helpful in getting artists started called Making It As An Artist by JoAnn DePolo that you may want to read. Good lock to you!|`|i9orREV5aa	Hi there! I answered a similar question for someone else yesterday and have included it for your below. Also, you can look up galleries in your area or target a gallery you're interested in and pitch your work to them. Expect them to take a big commission though, 40%-60%. Here's my exerpt:<br>  <br>  I'm not sure where you live but you should be able to google art shows and exhibits that may be happening in your area. You could go this route by purchasing a booth space for shows. Be sure to have a business card or pamphlet, something you can give out to people. <br>  <br>  Become a member of your local arts council, they offer workshops for this kind of thing and opportunities to exhibit your work. A lot of artists I know have also done well with a booth at a local Farmer's Market. There's lots of exposure. If you do this, have some artwork that is a lower price point for impulse buyers.<br>  <br>  I'm a resident artist at a place called "Williams Mill Visual Arts Studio". I rent a studio space and create my work there. We're open to the public on the weekends, and having a situation like that let's people know where they can always find you. There are a number of places around that function similarly to Williams Mill. Try googling a bunch of stuff, and talk to other artists. <br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|MP1nA5fRaa	Have you ever heard of "Art by Us"?

MR7qmPO6aa	Henry advised them to flee to Scotland and they subsequently took refuge in de Morville's Knaresborough Castle in North Yorkshire. It is known that Hugh de Morville, Richard de Breton, and William de Tracy built a church at Alkborough, near Scunthorpe in South Humberside, where, until 1690, an inscribed stone on the chancel recorded the benefaction.<br>  Despite their benefactions they failed to impress Pope Alexander III, and he excommunicated them on Maundy Thursday, 25 March 1171.<br>  The Archbishop's murderers finally gained their audience with the Pope, who, despite their penitence declared they should be exiled and fight in knightly arms in The Temple for 14 years in Jerusalem, and after the given time return to Rome.<br>  A Hugh de Morville appears in the service of the Crusader-king Richard I in the 1190s. It seems probable that this individual is one and the same. He stood hostage for Richard in 1194, when the king had been captured by Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor. As to the other three, there are various stories but no actual proof of what happened to them.|`|jgjZV7Ddaa	The king did not know what to do with them, for as murderers of a priest they were not amenable to lay jurisdiction, so he sent them to the pope, who could inflict no heavier penalty than fasting and banishment to the Holy Land.|`|FUHCb8Wpaa	they kicked the bucket.   creastedeagle.

That's as large as I could find. The link is below, if you want to see what you'd get for that money.. I'm actually surprised I was able to find one for under $25-30. As I told you, the "real" fakes are quite pricey, and the bigger they are, the  more they cost.<br>  <br>  The mold idea above is a good one, but you could also fill the molds with candy instead of wax. You'd only need to buy large quantities of sugar, a candy thermometer, and food coloring, then find a good lollipop or hard-candy recipe.|`|3h3DB3hMaa	if you find a mold that you think might work for the size and shape, you can use some kind of green wax in the right color and fill the molds.  let them set, cool, and dry and you will have huge emeralds for almost no money.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|aAGcYAsNaa	Green translucent plastic sheeting stretched/glued over frames made with straws taped together to form facets...should give a proper shiny, glass-like appearance.

mmAjpMX1aa	I would actually attend one of your wife's modeling sessions and see for yourself what is required in her work.  If the place is legit, I suspect that all doubt will be erased from your mind.<br>  <br>  The atmosphere around models, even nude models, is hardly sexy in a legitimate art business...in fact, most of the time it's about as sexy as a train wreck.  Models have to assume and hold uncomfortable positions all the time (try it yourself sometime, and see how difficult it is just to pose for a mere 5 minutes), and don't touch each other except as specifically needed by the artist (who doesn't touch the models either, that's highly against artistic ethical codes).<br>  <br>  You might feel better if you actually see what she does, meet her co-workers, and examine the portfolios and websites of the artists or photographers she works with...they will be more than happy to show you.  Check out the credentials of the artist, and ask the photographers who the intended audience is and where he plans on displaying the photos.<br>  <br>  If you go and you truly get a bad vibe from her workplace, you might have legitimate reason to keep feeling as you do...but more likely, after you see what really goes on there, I wager that you'll have no problem with what she does, male nude model or not, and will appreciate the finished product when it comes out.|`|1b5738a257bf0dcdcf42bd817a1e8692aa	I think you answered your own question. "in fact it bothers me".  A marriage is internal solely between the two people.  Everything else is external.  External factors cannot make or break a marriage, but will act as catalysts to speed up or slow down a rate of reaction.  You have real feelings about this which are in sharp contrast with her feelings.  This is going to fester.  You need to work it out with her BEFORE anything happens.  You need to come to an agreement that you BOTH are happy with.  If you can't, then the writing is on the wall.  Placation is slow suicide.|`|LVpyaf48aa	shes right. modeling is a form of art.<br>  do you think that tom cruise and rebecca demornay actually had sex while filming risky business? of course not. it was just an illusion. it was a form of art.<br>  <br>  all that being said, I think your wife still needs to respect your marriage. she has to understand that you are uncomfortable with the choices she is considering and you have to understand her motivations for wanting to take that extra step. you need to have a series of very open very honest discussions that do not turn into arguments and accusations about both of your perspctives on this subject. you need to understand each other. you need to agree on which direction to go with it. if you dont, the marriage may be in jeopardy. maybe a pro counselor could help work thru it with both of you.|`|OyAyb6bYaa	lucky...lol|`|QdMVWJDYaa	it will be hard to accept at first but it will have to be base on the trust factor we have that kind of talk will make you feel funny at first takes a little time for your stomach to settle down get it a little time if she want wants an answer give her one mind are made to be change. then say your was in a awker position that felt funny let me put you in one and see if you can stomach it. it hurts but feel better after cause you never would have know how you would handle it or would feel until you recover give you energy boost if handle good you will stay drain if handle wrong make the recovery good thing will happen behind the beginning will began over see and feel the new you
