Also, When he is "it" and tries to catch me, I weave left and right to confuse him and he always gets confused and stops. any tips to help him overcome these problems, and any tips in general? Before you ask why I want to make my opponent better is that I'm getting bored and I need a challenge.

20081011084128AABqWEM	Sports;Outdoor Recreation;Fishing	How do you tell if an alligator is beneath the surface of the water?	I go kayaking in an area of coastal Texas where alligators are fairly common. As you know if you're familiar with gators, you rarely actually see them, but we see signs of them often enough to know they are there. Sometimes while I'm paddling around, I notice a small stream of inconspicuous bubbles breaking steadily on the surface. Does that mean there's a gator down below? Or is there some other reason something might be causing the bubbles? I know "swamp gas" can cause bubbles, but I figure that's not likely to create a steady stream like this. I figure that must be a sign there's something down there that breathes air. What do you think?

But if you really watched the wwe you would know the IN RING WRESTLING Today is by far 10x better then it ever was in the Attitude era.      Plus the 80's had more memorable wrestlers then the Attitude era.       80's Hogan, Randy Savage, Ricky Steamboat, Ted Dibiase, King Kong Bundy, Ultimate Warrior, Ric Flair, Andre the Giant Jimmy "Super Fly" Snuka      Attitude Era : Stone Cold, The Rock, Triple H,       I will say the Attitude Era had edgier Entertainment but agian people bash the WWE today over being based to much on Entertainment

20061214085656AAHIsfm	Sports;Football (American)	How Can People Continue to Think Tony Romo is the Next Favre or Montana or even Great?	Let us take a look at who he played before you name him the new Messiah for the Cowboys. He has played against Indianpolis(2), New Orleans(5), Carolina(10), Tampa (17), Wash(22), NYG(29) Ariz(30). Parentheses are the pass defense ranks.     In the 3 losses Romo had in 8 games. He threw for 4 tds, 5 ints and 261.67 yds/g. In games against top 10 defenses, his stats are even worse: 1 td, 4ints and only 250 yds/g. If it was not for the Tampa game, where he threw 5 tds and no ints, He would have the same amount of Tds as Ints now.    Romo has played in two big games the season But the savior has been absent for both. Versus the Giants he threw 2 ints and no tds, in a game won by the run. Then, against New Orleans he threw 2 ints and 1 td in Garbage time. He looked pathetic again in the Sunday night in a loss.    You cannot even say he is a winner, he lost this weekend, and the Cowboys are no sure lock up for the playoffs. I think it was premature to crown Romo. Simpson even saw a loser.

20071011205602AApZ5fZ	Sports;Fantasy Sports	Steven Jackson/Brian Lenord Advice?

With that said is Brian Lenord worth a roster spot?      He has a tough matchup this weekend but in the next few weeks he would have a favorible matchup.      what do you think...      my RB's now are:      Rudi Johnson   Travis Henry   Ahman Green   still could add a 4th without letting any of these guys go.

My 12 year old has been in the soccer life since he was 4 years old. All of the boys who stuck with it till now have surpassed him in skill and developement by a pretty big margin. Being in this atmosphere for sometime now he is begining to accept who he is and what he has accomplished and shouldn't be playing at the level that he is playing at. I don't think that this is the answer, he is getting the same training as all the other boys but how can I help him prove to himself to go farther and try to play at the higher levels and motivate him to want it. I know he wants it but he isn't going for it. What can I do?

20090226124359AAXkOf2	Sports;Hockey	Why is Iginla rated so high?	I understand Iginla is ranked #1 overall in the NHL per GM and NHL scouts. Respect him as a player and do understand he has all the tools to be called a "complete player" but I do see some players in the    league who have all that Ignila has and more. Let's compare him to Datsyuk who I would say is top 5.      Hits - I am starting to think Datsyuk has almost become a "better"    hitter than even someone like Iginla - though he does not bowl people over like Iginla is capable of. Datsyuk's hits are perfectly timed and extremely effective.      Leadership - Iginla wins here.      Fights - Another Iginla win.      Defensively - Datsyuk destroys Iginla defensively.      Playmaker - I'll give Datsyuk the edge.      Scores - Iginla is a better goal scorer than Datsyuk (though not this year).      Datsyuk is amongst the league's best at face-offs.      Datsyuk consistently leads the league in takeaways.      Datsyuk is better on the PP and PK.      Datsyuk is the better skater and stick handler.      If fighting is your number one requirement for "All-around forward", which it is for a lot of people, than Datsyuk loses. But the only other areas Iginla is ahead of Datsyuk (leadership, hits and goal scoring) is not a huge gap. Personally, I would prefer defensive play over fighting, so I consider Datsyuk a much better all around forward.      Please feel free to share your knowledge, I'm always willing to learn.
