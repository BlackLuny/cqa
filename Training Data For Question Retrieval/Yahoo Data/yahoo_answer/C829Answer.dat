Pretty boring, but the food was American beef/potatoes type cuisine.  I have a running joke with my hubby (also trained in culinary) that if we ever opened one it would be The Mixed Bird Grill.  This time the main focus would be any kind of poultry, with some game meats, and veggie and seafood options thrown in for variety.  It would be a casual environment, good wine/beer pairings, and crazy names for the dishes, but no specific cuisine.       This is all in fun, I never want to own a restaurant again, it ruined my first marriage.|`|hMawaSHdaa	well i'm mixed but i would open a cuban cusine restaurant in little havana, fl and call it " juanita la cubanita" lol
w3fDRSUAaa	Why does popcorn pop? Popcorn, like all grains, contains water. About thirteen and a half to fourteen percent of each kernel is made up of water. So when a popcorn kernel is heated above the boiling point of 212 degrees Fahrenheit, this water turns to steam. This steam creates pressure within the kernel, causing the kernel to explode and turn itself inside out.      But, if the water inside a piece of popcorn is what makes it pop, why don't other grains pop as well? Wheat and rice contain water, so why don't we sit down to watch a movie with a bucket of popped rice or popped wheat?     The answer lies in the differences between the outer coverings, called hulls, of popcorn and other grains. Unlike rice and wheat, and unlike even regular corn, popcorn has a non-porous hull that traps steam. With the porous hulls of other grains, steam easily passes through, so no significant pressure is produced. These grains may parch, but they will not pop.     But even popcorn, with its special hull, doesn't always pop. Popcorn must have two important properties to pop well. First, the amount of moisture in the kernel must be very close to thirteen and a half percent. Too little moisture and enough steam won't build up to pop the kernel. Too much moisture and the kernels pop into dense spheres, rather than the light fluffy stuff popcorn fanciers love.    A Special Moment Of ?Kiki? Science!|`|XHnpraaxaa	So we can smell it and want it go badly.|`|2ieiGIhTaa	It has got a little bit of moisture in the center of the sealed kernel, which when heated turns to steam and violently expands.|`|HoOHLN7zaa	Heat causes the inside of the kernal to pop out, forming pop corn|`|KHipZhWoaa	The tasty secret: water.    Each popcorn kernel contains a hard outer shell and a starchy inside surrounding a dab of water. When the kernels are heated to about 450 degrees Fahrenheit, the pocket of water turns into steam and expands within the tough casing. Like blowing up a balloon, as more and more steam forms, the pressure against the outer shell increases. When shell can no longer contain the building pressure and finally gives way with the classic pop. The kernel turns inside-out, revealing the softened starch that makes up the white spongy part of your favorite movie snack|`|Jil94qTAaa	That is easy. Is for the explosion. Inside of the Korn there is a little watter, this watter cames steam with the warm. the steam needs more space than the liquid watter and this produces a explosion that expands the Kernell from inside.     By the way a Orange is Orange because in this way is more visible. The fruits need attract an animal for being eaten. This is true, the fruits are produced by the tree for be eaten. The pulp of the fruit is processed in the stomach of the animal but the seed survives, and then, the seed is throwed out with the, emm lest just tell that the plant uses the mobility of the animal to disperse it seeds. Exept the coconuts, the seed of this plant float over the sea.    By the way, the Korn is a American plant, it was cultivated by many american cultures like The Native Americans and the Aztecs.

You may get sick. So I trust you to don't drink the frappacino. Since you put it in the fridge all that time, it might be moldy inside. Even if you put baking soda in the refridgarator. Frappacinos have caffeine so I can say that you can't drink an expired coffee date, period.

Refrigerate overnight, turning occasionally if desired.   When ready to cook, place the roast in a slow cooker along with any remaining marinade. Do not add water. Roast on Low for 8 to 10 hours, or until desired doneness. For medium-rare, a meat thermometer should read 135 degrees F (57 degrees C). Remove from the slow cooker to a serving plate, and allow to rest 15 minutes before slicing across the grain.

The tortillas are slightly fried and filled with frijoles refritos (refried beans) and pork, or in this recipe spicy chorizo. I cheated with the refried beans as I didn't have time to soak them so I used canned, which are ok if but a little too salty. I used Emmental cheese, which is not authentic but I though it would work well. It did. This dish was a huge success.  Servings    Serves 4  Covered with melted Emmental  Covered with melted Emmental  Ingredients        * 8 corn tortillas      * 2 cans refried beans (or home-made refried beans)      * 110 g (4 oz) grated Emmenthal cheese, Monterey Jack or Cheddar cheese      * 1/2 a small jar of pickled jalape?os chillies or to taste      * 150 ml to 200 ml (1/4 pint +) of beef or vegetable stock      * 120 g (4 oz) or a packet of spicy chorizo, sliced      * A handful of fresh coriander, chopped      * 8 tablespoons sour cream      * Garlic olive oil for frying the corn tortillas     Method  Grapefruit salsa  Grapefruit salsa       1.

So you don't use too much oil, turn the first one over after a minute, put the next uncooked one on top of this to soak a little of the oil, flip them both. Remove the cooked one and repeat until they are all done. Add a few more drops of olive oil if the pan is too dry.     4. Layer each tortilla with chorizo and the cold contents of one tin of beans, as in the photo.     Lay them in an ovenproof dish       1. Heat the remaining tin of beans and add enough stock to make them pourable. This way the bean sauce can get between the tortillas. Stir in the pickled jalape?os     2. Pour the bean mixture over the tortillas, add a drizzle of garlic olive oil over the top and cover with the grated cheese     3.

doz7RIoeaa	Since when has PETA done anything that wasn't stupid? They just want to attract attention to themselves to gain more donations and keep the organization alive and their bosses salaries paid. And they exploit the sorry state of animals AND women in order to do that. Compare it to the Queen  throwing out crumbs of bread so the poor folks won't notice the cake on her plate. Queen Ingrid throwing out a few cheap PETA2 stickers and flyers and "starter kits" so that the kids won't notice she's been palling around with celebrities using their "donations" and membership dues.   And sorry but showing graphic pictures and images on non cable TV is also not allowed.

I have a shirt that has a woman with a fur boa around her neck, and underneath it, it says 'real women fake it'....i love it!!|`|4pco9j9Faa	That's exactly what I as thinking when I saw the add! I understand that PeTA wanted the attention, but the message "vegetarians have better sex" is not going to make people reconsider their current diets even a little bit. Plus it was absolutely degrading to women.    I think showing some of the graphic images in Meet your Meat would have been much more effective, simply because it would make people THINK about what they were eating.     Whatever... PeTA can't do anything correctly. They always go one step too far.|`|fBW54cAraa	I agree with you.|`|B365rHNAaa	"They should have showed videos of the animals being mistreated, or given facts about how they are severely mistreated, i think they were very stupid"    I think you're stupid|`|5e1843a800af8a0c4fa0753cee310ddbaa	well their goal is to get peoples attention and it did, but its inappropriate for kids|`|mbv2jLqDaa	I have to agree with exsft.  PETA never goes about things the right way.  Everyone has choices and sometimes they shove vegetarianism and veganism down omnivores' throats.  I think they promote everything in a poor manner, they could do it more tastefully.  I mean, they are advertising for a good cause...just in the wrong ways.|`|nIbSh4WGaa	I am at a loss to understand what PETA is going for.  The add is moronic and senseless.  I have no idea what their point is.  The add, in my opinion, is disgusting. Broccoli or asparagus in the snatch does not incline me to give up beef.  What a complete joke, i.e. PETA
PenbhD1uaa	it's just fat and protein that's it.  It's normal|`|cpiIh5JOaa	its probably fat from the fish|`|KPDOrmTsaa	Actually, I believe it is like blood.  Kind of like when the juices cook as they are coming out of a piece of chicken.
l1TJpNeqaa	While the mac and cheese is in the oven the corn should be in there too. Corn won't turn into mush like some other veggies. Corn in mac and cheese is sooooooooo good!!!     so,, while your putting everything in the pan, mix the corn in there too, sprinkle some cheese on top and pop it in the oven! You'll have a good dinner tonight.. good luck!!|`|P8CBDLiKaa	I'd heat the corn in a separate pot and serve it on the side with the mac & cheese rather than mix it in, but if you want to mix it in, just drain the can and throw in the corn when you add the cheese.|`|yXno8yIkaa	Drain it well, and add it when you mix the cheese sauce in, just before it goes in the oven. No need to heat it before, it just makes more dishes. This will be really good, I love corn with baked mac and cheese!|`|NxS5D5DSaa	Drain the corn really well, and then add it after you have cooked the macaroni.  When you're mixing the cheese into the cooked macaroni, add the corn, and then bake it (sprinkle some more cheese on top).|`|9fdyfwO4aa	I'm w/ natim1 - drain & add w/the cheese but I like to add dried crumbs or crushed ritz crackers & cheese to the top before baking.
xrRZeROmaa	Yes, use the Boullion.  If you want to make your own boullion, boil chicken pieces, cooked or raw until the meat falls off the bone.  add celery, carrots, onions and garlic to enhance the flavor, and add water as needed till the meat falls off the bone, and the knuckles dissolve.      I use the wing tips and neck, as well as any left over pieces from a chicken dinner, and boil for 1 1/2 to 2 hours at low temperature.  Pour the broth through a colander, and save the meat and mushy vegetables for a rice dish later.      The clear broth can be frozen in individual zip-lock baggies for several weeks, or you can freeze in an ice cube tray, and bag the cubes.  One cube of well rendered chicken broth will make a cup of soup.|`|hKlsJgVSaa	Yes you can use a bullion cube. One cube makes 8 oz of broth.    To make your own broth, brown some chicken backs. Then add water with celery, carrots, and onions, and seasoned salt.     Simmer real low for 3-4 hours. Strain and then refridgerate. Pull off the fat layer. It will have a bit of a gelatin consistency. It's supposed to be like that, it's fromt he bone marrow.     Then Place in ice cube trays and freeze. Then pop them out into freezer bags. 1 cube is about 1 oz.|`|YYAu9lFDaa	you sure can. go for it!    i dunno about your own broth... i'd just lightly fry some chicken and put it in a huge pot w/ water, your favorite seasonings and veggies and let it stew for hours.    i'm sure you can freeze it as well.|`|auUeI2Vnaa	Ive done it.  The only difference I notice is that it's saltier.|`|zXavPbXfaa	absolutely.  The container the boillion came in will tell you the amount of boiling water to dissolve the boullion in to make the equivalent of broth.    And for homemade, here's what I do:    Get a few pounds of bone-in chicken pieces (the bones add flavor) and add to a pot. Toss in chunks of carrots, celery, onion, your favorite seasonings and enough water to cover it all.     Simmer on the stove at least an hour (or longer) until the flavor's as strong as you'd prefer.   I cook mine several hours until it's a rich golden brown color.    Strain the chunks out, and remove the chicken from the bones (save it for soup or other recipes). I discard everything else (onions, carrots, etc.)    And yes, it can be frozen and reheated no problem!|`|c63d23a0d58654baa299d30bffb007bbaa	yes, just omit any salt in the original recipe because boullion from cubes tends to be saltier than regular broth.|`|SdcybGDTaa	yes
I40vnqNyaa	A lot of wild mushrooms can be eaten, but a few are very poisonous.  You need to go and buy a mushroom book, there are specific ones that will help you identify particular varieties of mushrooms.  I saw an episode of  Jamie Oliver that was dedicated entirely to mushrooms picked in the wild.  That is what they (he and the expert he had with him) recommended.  They said get the book and identify from photographs etc.  Apparently it is easy to distinguish the good from the bad.  I would still be very careful though, get to know them well before you eat any as some can actually kill you.|`|5ta5yyWSaa	Cooking won't help get rid of poison. Unless you are absolutely sure - don't touch them. Morels are very distinctive and grow in the spring in the woodlands of rural Ohio.|`|cpiIh5JOaa	there probably poisonous, the mushroom we eat are grown in farms|`|DIEih5asaa	If they peel cleanly they shoud be OK,but if you are not sure ..... DON'T.|`|0DguhW0Daa	It is probably safest to not try and eat wild mushrooms because there is a good chance they're poisonous, but here is a good website to check if a mushroom is poisonous. (If you want to risk it.) It tells what clues about mushrooms can mean if they poisonous or not.    http://mdc.mo.gov/nathis/mushrooms/mushr...    Also there is some other information on that website about edible mushrooms too.|`|jWPaqFqQaa	Is there an agricultural college nearby? They might be the best source for a definitive answer. Be aware that some poisonous mushrooms can look a lot like edible ones, so until you have some experience with identifying them, you should probably not eat any.|`|miMIVR5Waa	once youve positively identified a wild mushroom as edible, you should taste only a small bit and wait 24 hours. Some people have adverse reactions. Finally, cook all mushrooms thoroughly to be on the safe side.     to be absolutely safe, the only mushrooms you should eat are those found at supermarkets and restaurants!|`|c63d23a0d58654baa299d30bffb007bbaa	don't even take a chance! there are more poisonous mushrooms than not, so unless you know any mycologists... don't chance it.  some can kill you
llkSmgLJaa	Unless your a trained botanist you can't. Buy them from the store, It's not worth the risk. Many types of mushroom are deadly.|`|doz7RIoeaa	Buy a book then study it carefully. Go out into the woods and just look to see for yourself but DON'T PICK. Better leave it to the experts until you are knowledgeable enough to tell the difference. If there are wild mushroom pickers (preferably very experienced adults)  where you live, ask if you can go with them for practical experience. And even if you think you know enough and picked some, take them to an expert for sorting. Consumption of poison mushrooms can be fatal.|`|9gEYdLKZaa	Go to a local book store and get a field guide to mushrooms. Pay attention to all details, the smallest difference may mean life or death.|`|54a71494855e0d728b9ec00aab8ff5cfaa	Eating wild mushrooms is not recommended unless you are well educated on the subject. There are gourmet mushrooms that have poison look a likes growing in the wild.. The morel being one, there is a wild mushroom that looks exactly like the morel but it is deadly if eaten.|`|bfFNIBtIaa	As some people have mentioned, you can get some decent books on the subject. But if it's a mushroom you're not familiar with, and you're not 100% sure about identifying them, you're probably best off getting an expert to identify it before you eat them. The consequence of eating even a small amount of poisonous mushrooms can mean death if not treated quickly. With some types, this can occur even if they're cooked to virtually ash. Be very careful.|`|9HRkwzruaa	Don't eat wild mushrooms unless you have a lot of training and experience in identifying them.  Seriously - many mushrooms look alike, and what you think is a perfectly harmless little fungus could be extremely toxic...as in deadly.    I know it costs more than picking them in your back yard, but buying them at the store is a whole lot safer.  Please don't eat them wild.
VCfk5ZQbaa	i agree with the whole clique thing in high school.  I'd say invite your four bffs and invite as many guys as you want.  And if they have girlfriends, and they are your friends too, invite them.  I know the problem of having the girls all over the guys.  It sucks.  I'd say get about 7 or 8 guys and 5 or 6 girls.  Then you can have 2 guys to yourself, everyone else gets 1! lol, have fun and happy birthday!!!!!    xoxo  caseyy.??|`|GOYPKp3Baa	Dude, it's way fun with guys so just invite guys and girls if you want :)  It doesn't matter, I know girls want guys at the party too.

What other people think does not matter. If they aren't invited so what?! If you are inviting guys, you might want to invite some girls. It doesn't have to be alot. Any BTW if you are having it at your house, I know you wouldn't want just anyone at your house. At least I wouldn't. But make your decisions wisely, its your birthday and you do wanna enjoy it.|`|aOfq8Pgeaa	If you have more guy friends than girls, it's only natural to invite your friends (guys)!

l1TJpNeqaa	Yes you can, but make sure to use twice as many eggs as needed. The yolk is a more concentrated glue, the white isn't as good for something like meatballs, but if you use twice as many eggs it will work for sure.|`|qpxPW5paaa	yes, your just using the egg to bond the other ingredients when it cooks. The egg whites will cook up just as well|`|AhO0Uoppaa	it wont work as good, its really the yolk that binds the ingrediants together the white just makes up the rest|`|64d7116e9576cea4e490b98f53879fa8aa	Absolutely.|`|GQBd4WUSaa	what makes the eggs into glue is the protien, since eggwhites are mainly protien it would be ok|`|vVTmJjJDaa	definitely - in fact, many people on low-cholesterol diets *only* use egg whites in those types of recipes.    Edit:  Jellee's answer (down the list) is correct - you must use *twice* the amount of egg white when substituting for a whole egg, and *then* it will work out fine...    good work, Jellee..(give that girl the points!)|`|cF7mltsFaa	you can try but one: the flavour just won't be there and two: the yolk is needed to emulsify the meat and stuff in a meatball, if anything use one yolk per two egg whites|`|sM6sIjhBaa	egg whites works the same as a whole egg substitute about 50mL in place of an egg or use 2 egg whites instead of a whole egg|`|PenbhD1uaa	Yes it will work as i do it all the time because i am on a diet.  Thanks and Good luck!!!!
PenbhD1uaa	Chowder is any of a variety of soups, enriched with salt pork fatback and thickened with flour, or more traditionally with crushed ship biscuit or saltine crackers, and milk. To some Americans, it means clam chowder, made with cream or milk in most places, or with tomato as "Manhattan clam chowder." Corn chowder is a thick soup filled with whole corn (maize) kernels.    The most accepted etymology for the word chowder comes from the pot in which it is cooked. The French word chaudron translated means "a pot," developed from chaud, "hot" (also related to the Latin calderia and English cauldron). The word "chowder" is a New England word that came from Newfoundland, where Breton fishermen  who would throw portions of the day's catch and other available foods into a large pot  introduced the word, and perhaps the fish soup itself (compare bouillabaisse). Another possible origin for the word chowder is derived from the Old English "jowter", which means fishmonger (one who peddles fish).    Fish chowder, along with corn and clam chowder, continues to enjoy popularity in New England and Atlantic Canada. Seafood chowder is a traditional and popular dish in Ireland. Sometimes the freshest clam chowder can have a gritty consistency due to small particles of sand still present in the clams at the time of preparation.        Cream SOUP  Traditionally a soup based on a bchamel sauce. Loosely, any soup finished with cream, a cream variant such as sour cream, or a liaison.|`|WxGoc1fPaa	Chowder is a cartoon and Cream Soup is a soup         :)|`|sM6sIjhBaa	chowder is just a type of cream soup|`|RdvL6CGmaa	Chowder has things it it like potatoes and meats.... cream soup is just cream and broth.|`|b04999b0e7ff207909ed958e37c605caaa	chowder is a mixture of cream and some sort of stock...    cream soup is basically cream with ingredients cooked into it      I'm inferring|`|5ta5yyWSaa	Chowder is a thick chunky soup based on seafood. Manhattan is tomato based and doesn't have cream. Cream soups are dairy based and are usually indicated as cream of asparagus, cream of chicken etc.     The only exception would be some commercial New England clam chowder with barely any clams or just clam juice, milk, corn and salt masquerading as the real thing or corn chowder for those without clams.|`|9hSSocD0aa	idk. it just is.  -XD|`|q6kvVkNPaa	chowder has more of a crab taste to it and cream soup is very creamy(without crab taste)|`|YcgEmrRkaa	chowder  3 entries found.       1. 1chowder (transitive verb)     2. 2chowder (noun)     3.

To control bad breath you must get rid of the cause of bad breath. Stick out your tongue and look for some "white stuff" on the back of your tongue.  That is the bacteria which needs to be cleaned off. I use a tongue cleaner OraBush along with some mouthwash and it really cleans my tongue because it is both a brush and a scraper.

Should get you on your way, some recipes have more feedback from the brewer so I would try those out first.    In terms of equipment, you generally need a basic or starter beer making kit.  Some examples are here http://www.midwestsupplies.com/products/... .  The $90 one will cover you for everything you would need, including wine making.  The $60 one doesn't have the glass carboy so secondary fermentation is a bit trickier (or you won't be able to do this and end up with more sediment in your bottles).     For bottles you can reuse the ones that you already have, just need to sanitize them.  You will need caps and make sure you have or buy a capping tool.

I40vnqNyaa	I make a salad of mixed lettuce (use lots of different coloured ones), thin strips of red capsicum, grape tomatoes cut in half, very finely sliced red onion, crumbled greek fetta and a handful of kalamata olives thrown in with some sliced avacado over the top. I serve mine on a large plate instead of a bowl as it looks nicer like a restaurant dish and all the good stuff doesnt fall to the bottom.    Other things i sometimes add to a salad is small pieces of baked sweet potato or pumpkin and or Char grilled asparagus.  Its delicious.    I make my own salad dressing which is made up of Extra virgin olive oil, little bit of sesame oil, good quality balsamic vinegar,  (use an authentic brand) sweet chilli sauce (makes it thicker and takes off the sharp edge), crush a little garlic and put that in, cut a long red chilli longways in half and very finely slice it up and put that in (don't use birdseye as its too hot and leave out the seeds) put all these things into a large jar or wide neck bottle and shake it up. will keep for weeks in the fridge, will separate but just let it come back to room temp and shake again and it will come back together. :)|`|AA11263103	Next time you go to the store:  spinach /romaine   dried cranberries  feta cheese  pecans or almonds (sliced)  favorite dressing  ____________________       spinach/romaine  cherry tomatoes or any others   carrots  cucumber  feta  favorite dressing|`|BBol9etoaa	oven dry the tomatoes  caramelize the onions  salt the cucumbers and squeeze the water out and rinse.|`|gFzmBjqPaa	Maybe add some garlic and onion powder.  Some salt and pepper.  If you had cheddar cheese and some bacon that would help too.  Crutons help, but they add that garlic and onion taste.  You have basic salad ingredients so make sure all is fresh for a fresh tasting salad.|`|geih5vR8aa	Slice ALL the ingredients you have, and toss them in a salad bowl. If you have croutons, throw them in there. If you have cheese, throw it in there. A good cheese, not like cheese slices.|`|v4vQSzu4aa	You have all of the base ingredients for a fabulous salad, you just don't know it right now.  Restaurant Salads take into consideration texture, variety, freshness with local and seasonal available ingredients. Don't be afraid to add in some mushrooms, zucchini, scallions (green onions) cracked black pepper on the greens (mix in some other greens besides your normal lettuce, like romaine, mescaline mix, green/red leaf, red cabbage, spinach, arugula, shredded carrots, thinly sliced celery)  the combinations of greens can make or break a salad, as for the other ingredients, you can always add what you have.  I like squeezing a little fresh lemon juice on my greens before I add the toppings (so to speak).  You can also warm certain toppings to make it interesting, like your onions in the list above.  Vary your dressings as well, add some crunch to the top with toasted nuts, home made bread crumbs, shredded cheese, fresh crumbled bacon or diced lunch meat (heated up) a hard boiled egg, or you can even saute all of your salad toppings and pour them over your cold lettuce (this is my favorite salad), you get warm, cold, crunchy and smoothness all at the same time.  So, I hope some of these simple suggestions can help you to love and enjoy your salads again!  Good Question, by the way!|`|SdcybGDTaa	green peppers,celery,broccoli,meat like ham or turkey, cheese,mushrooms, bacon, carrots, salt, pepper. I'm getting hungry thinking about it!!!|`|IAhxPTXgaa	it's fresh vegetables and better dressings that the restaurant have.     try adding sweet peppers, olives, cheese, crutons, boiled egg,   nuts, and sprinkling different seasoning on it, like black pepper, salt, (i add a multipurpose seasoning.)
pdHdCC9Zaa	yes you can freeze an uncooked or cooked pumpkin pie.  I wouldn't freeze it for too long though, maybe three months because of the amount of eggs in it.|`|fEBOzWeXaa	you sure can freeze it raw.  You can buy raw pumplin pies in the store.

zXavPbXfaa	First of all.... from one 'burgher to another....  HERE WE GO, STEELERS..... Here we Go!!    Secondly.... my sister has had luck using chocolate icing and adding black POWDERED or GEL food coloring, as opposed to that liquid kind from the grocery store.  It might be more difficult to find, however.    As an alternative, why not ice the cake in yellow frosting (use a simple white icing and add plain old store-bought food coloring to tint it yellow).  Then, decorate it with black decorating icing or gel (you can find it in a squeezable tube in the cake aisle of the grocery store).|`|rQ3UEMQuaa	Great idea!  Yes black cake frosting does take good but it will dye the people that eat it's lips a little blackish colored.  How about you do yellow icing with black accent icing and black sprinkles.|`|daJk1VePaa	erm, in the UK you can buy black icing in like tubes, so you could ice it in yellow and details and things with black    GO STEELERS, my american friends support them so, yeah... i gotta be root in here in london!|`|pdHdCC9Zaa	I don't know how to make it but I do know that it will stain your tongue, teeth, skin, and ANYTHING it comes in contact with!  I found this out the hard way with an over the hill cake.  And if anyone gets "sick" the stuff looks like a dark grey, and it does the same to your...well...poop.  The black really stains EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!  I would go with the white frosting as the backround and use black and yellow as the accent colors....|`|hLohtlPEaa	Wilton makes a black food coloring paste. Be careful though, it can take on a bitter taste when used to excess. Just use it for outlines instead of the whole cake.|`|uap6JAqQaa	when i make black icing, i use the paste/gel that comes in a little pot - it's made by wilton, and can be found at craft stores like michael's and a.c. moore. you may be able to find black sprinkles/sugars there, or these can be ordered online. good luck!
zXavPbXfaa	That will work.  Just fill to 2/3 full and bake a little longer (until a toothpick inserted in center of one comes out clean).|`|ToztjpAsaa	I made some today - just heaped the mixture in to just below the rim of the case and they worked fine.

I have a texas size muffin pan that makes huge muffins/cupcake and I have used it many times. You just have to adjust your time in the oven cause if you add more mixture to make them bigger then you will have to leave them in the oven longer.|`|5ta5yyWSaa	Pour until you fill them 2/3 of the cup and bake about 5 minutes more or until the toothpick comes out clean. They are about twice the size so you will make only about half as many - but double your friends!|`|uq4ZuWnEaa	There is no problem doing this.

TQCSwCpQaa	They want you to rinse off the starch so that the rice sticks less.  Short grain rice is stickier than long grain, so it depends of which type you use.  I go with 1 part rice to 1-1/2 or 1-3/4 parts water.  Don't know what to tell you about using their measuring cup.  A pint's a pound the world around.....|`|4Pk6VNftaa	Eh, you don't HAVE to use the measuring cup that came with the cooker.  1 cup of rice is 1 cup of rice.  1 cup of uncooked rice is enough for 3 or 4 people.    There is some debate about rinsing the rice.  Everyone I know does it and says it's to remove any dust or dirt from the rice.  Meanwhile, others argue that you're rinsing away important vitamins and minerals.      If you decide to rinse the rice, pour enough cold water to cover the rice, mix it around with your hand, then dump out the water.  Do this 3 or 4 times - the water should be mostly clear the last time you dump out the water.    Now fill the pot so that the water covers the rice by about 1/2 an inch.  Be sure the rice is flat and even at this point to ensure proper cooking.  Don't bother with a ruler - just stick your finger in the water so that the tip is resting on the rice.  The water should come up to your first knuckle.  Eventually you'll just be able to eyeball it.  Rice and rice cookers are amazingly forgiving.     Then just put the pot in the cooker, put the lid on, push the button and 20 minutes later, *ding* you have rice.    Adding "too much" water to the rice isn't necessarily a bad thing...  You just made Congee, which is essentially rice porridge.  Congee is eaten as a breakfast food (you can get it at DimSum places) and will often have little bits of meat or veggies tossed into it.  It's also a good comfort food when you're sick, have an upset stomach, or a hangover.|`|s9Uufsr0aa	The ratio is usally 2 parts water to 1 part rice.  I find wild rice blends need more water than that though.    Washing the rice is not a must BUT it does clean off the grains so they don't get quite a starchy.|`|Pav5KhmLaa	equal amounts of water and rice. thats how I do it, and it comes out fine, hope this helps|`|LtB7zdTNaa	Depends on what kinda rice. If you cook Thai Jasmine rice the water must be about half finger above rice. The same way water when you cook with traditional periuk.|`|200f630432eb7a10b4eb96339e0c7d41aa	A few things...components of the rice cooker:    1. The pot: the inner aluminum pot that fits into the rice cooker.Make sure the outside of the pot is completely dry before you put it into the rice cooker. (Just wipe it with a dish towel)  2. The rice cooker: the electrical component that does the actual cooking.     *Place your rice (1 C.) in the pot, cover it with water, swish it around and pour some of it out...use your hand to hold the grains of rice in the pot. (Note: This is really a matter of preference. Some people feel that the grains could hold dust and debris so you need to rinse it. However, if you are eating white (enriched) rice, there are vitamins added into the grains in powder form so you don't want to wash it all away.)    *Fill up the pot with enough water to cover the rice entirely AND then you must add in 1 more inch of water (my mom use to tell us to use our finger tip to touch the rice and fill the water line up to the first digit of your finger)...trust me on this! So, don't worry so much about the actual ratio of rice to water in terms of measuring cups. Seriously. However much dry grains of rice you put in ...it will cook up to at least double the size. 1 C. of dry rice will yield about 3-4 servings of cooked rice.     *Set the pot into the rice cooker and press the cook button. When the cook button turns off, most people just assume the rice is ready. However, it doesn't hurt to let it sit for about 5 minutes. Most of the steam and extra moisture should evaporate by then. Rice cookers do take a bit of getting use to but once you do...you'll use it often!    Oh yeah, cooking brown rice is just a little bit tricky. Use the same method as above but just add about 1 1/2 in of water to the top & then  let the rice steam for about 10 minutes after cooking. If not you take the chance of it being slightly undercooked.
I40vnqNyaa	Its always best to brown off the meat and onions first.  You want to caramelise all the natural sugars in the meat and onions as this is what gives the meat a lot more flavour.|`|hKlsJgVSaa	No no no do not put it in raw. Cook itup and brown it. I cook it up 1/2 way drain most of the fat off and add the onions and garlic. Then add the chilli powders. The "bloom" best in oil/fats.  Not to mentiont it makes it easier to mix it all up.|`|lTkYWiy5aa	You can do it either way but it will definitely be tastier if you cook the ground beef first.|`|5ta5yyWSaa	Saute the ground beef first with the onions to develop flavor and then drain to get rid of the excess fat.  I sometimes make it in a pressure cooker which takes 1/2 hour since my husband the chef can't make up his mind about what he wants to eat until dinner.      If you are price conscious, note that 95% lean ground beef costs $3.99/lb while less lean ground beef or even ground 93/7 turkey costs $1.99/lb.|`|fEBOzWeXaa	if your hamburger is a little fatty, cook and drain first.  If you are using 95% lean, you can put it in raw.|`|AA11394457	Have tried it both ways, and although my instinct tell me is safer cooking the meat first, the chili made with raw meat tasted much better.

You don't want any bits of raw meat in your chili.    I love chili ^_^.|`|pTZ5M2Q3aa	Brown the beef first. To add more flavor, add the veggies to the beef as you brown it. Then pour it all into the crock pot with your seasonings and liquid. When the chili is done, skim the fat off of the top.|`|zGSfHdvYaa	Before you put it in the crock-pot, brown the meat with just a tad bit of water and maybe some salt and pepper, then you should be set!|`|APNB4OfIaa	Brown it off & drain most of the fat.
JfVxCDb7aa	Your best bet is google, yahoo, microsoft, or ask.com's search engine. Sorry I can't be more of a help.
l8ddp0F3aa	Oh, I used to be just like your boyfriend.  the truth is, many store brands ARE the same are the name brand - from the same factory and plant and company and everything.  They market their products in both the brand name form and the cheaper version, so they gain more market share without really sacrificing profits.  If he isn't convinced, here are a couple of suggestions:    cooking from scratch is really cheaper than using convenience foods anyway.  Try some crock-pot meals that involve ingredients that are not "brand" or "generic."    Suggest a compromise:  See if he will agree to buy equal amounts of brand and generic.  Tell him that you don't intend to advise him which you are serving and see if he can guess.  If he can't, he really has no argument.  Be sure to hide the cans so he can't guess with an advantage :)    I don't recommend trying to trick him.    Good luck!|`|de641317a0696a8d53df9d1538305a2baa	He INSISTS???  He needs to get over that one quickly.  Esp. with a baby on the way.  Good luck.|`|y0EKOmRuaa	my husband used to be like that until i bought a store brand of cereal and just put it in the name brand box to prove him wrong. it worked.|`|hXaAxd1Gaa	explain that hell have to put aside his preferences for not only you two, but the baby as well.|`|GdlRXshvaa	buy them secretly and make a food dish then if he likes it tell him it wasn't a name brand food item idk id do that lol unless he would get mad at you for doing that. otherwise tell him that you cant afford to buy name brand food items|`|hKlsJgVSaa	Buy it one time in name brand, then refill with the store brand. Make sure to toss the containers right away.    Or tell him to cold hard facts. There isn't enough money for name brand, and he needs to suck it up. He's going to be a dad and has to start making sacrifices for his unborn child. This is one of them.    You could also do a blind taste test. I had this same argument with snacks and soda's with my nephew last summer when he stayed with us. When it all came down to it he admited that generic was okay. And in some cases better.    Even though I am a primarily generic shopper there are a few things I insist on name brand. Mayo (Kraft or Best foods-they are the same company anyway), and Campbells Tomatoe Soup. I can do generic chicken noodle and all the but it Must be Campbells for Tomato.    And due to diet restrictions now I must eat brand name on soem rpdocts like low sodium ketchup, reduced sodium canned soups etc...but look sometimes the store brand is better for you than the name brand.|`|zn6OVTJHaa	Make a deal with him. Cook up a name brand and a non name brand item. Tell him that if he can tell the difference, he wins....if not, he can get over his problem and let you buy non name brand stuff! In most cases it's exactly the same!    Oh, and if he happens to choose the right answer, never admit it. ;)|`|q6kvVkNPaa	maybe you can try buying a non-brand item and the same type of item as a brand name and do like a taste test kind of thing. You can try making a meal with the non-brand item and see if he enjoys it. (don't tell him that its a non-brand item before he try's it) If he likes the meal maybe he will relieze it isn't as bad as he thought.   hope this helps

Q4oPyclQaa	The flavouring and sugar from the gum dissolve into your salvia and you taste it and swallow it.  You aren't just tasting the gum - you're tasting the sugars and flavours that come out of the gum when you chew it.    If it dries out your mouth it's probably either you're chewing it too long, or you are dehydrated.|`|PTP8ptDbaa	because its naturally absorbs your saliva! some types of gums don't like trident, orbit, juicy fruit and double mint.|`|de641317a0696a8d53df9d1538305a2baa	The sugar goes away as you chew, and as you chew, your mouth is slightly open, and the saliva gets a chance to evaporate.

zXavPbXfaa	Honestly, I don't think so.    I'm assuming the mix was very liquidy as most pump. pie is custard-based.    If you dumped in a LARGE amount of salt, a good bit of it probably dissolved into it or was absorbed instantly.     I'm sorry.|`|1ilfOgBjaa	No.  Toss it.|`|5ta5yyWSaa	No. She needs to run to the store and buy more.|`|daJk1VePaa	just increase the amounts of other ingredient's, vastly by the sounds of it|`|GdlRXshvaa	i don't think so the only way i can think of how to is if its unmixed and the pumpkin pie mix is thick enough yu could probably just turn it upside down and pour the alt out into a bowl or something but there's still going to be some in the pie mix , you could just take spoon and scrape it out otherwise it will be salty    depending on how much is a lot like a heaping pile|`|lW2B6HFSaa	You can't but you could go buy some more mix.mmmmmmmmmmmmm  ima go make me some pumpkin pie now.|`|hKlsJgVSaa	It is has been stirred in the no there is nothing you can do.|`|I40vnqNyaa	Normally if you add too much salt to a recipe you throw in a peeled potato or two and it will absorb most of the salt.  However with as much salt as you've described i think your recipe has had it.  You are going to have to throw it away im afraid.  There is nothing that will get a whole container of salt out. :(

Ax54M1Dhaa	Since people have already answered what freezer burn really is here's how you prevent it from happening to your food.    First off no matter what you do your freezer should be set to its coldest setting.  The temperature should be below 0 degrees F.  This will freeze the liquid in the food quicker resulting in smaller ice crystal which results in less shredding of the internal cells of the food.  Don't worry about the electricity it doesn't take all that much more to keep it at the lower temperature and its worth it.    1. Use vacuum sealed freezer bags.  I believe Ziploc has just come out with a cheap version    2. If you don't want to do that then wrap whatever your are freezing (even if it is already in its own packaging) in 2 layers of aluminum foil and then put in a standard zip freezer bag.  Leave a small corner of the bag open and suck the air out with your lips and seal it.  Don't forget to label it since the foil prevents you from seeing the food.|`|fEBOzWeXaa	Freezer burn is caused by extreme cold air.  that is why it is important to remove as much air as possible out of packages of food you intend to freeze.  If you intend to use the product shortly after freezing, you may never see it but if something is in the freezer without a cover or poorly wrapped you will see it within days.|`|AA10405438	Air gets to the food.|`|de641317a0696a8d53df9d1538305a2baa	Air pockets in the storage container (or in between freezer wrap and food) help to wick away the liquid in the food.  Notice how freezer burnt food is all dried out and whitish, yet there's ice crystals all around it?  The ice crystals used to be the liquid in the food!  You can prevent this by using one of those vacuum-sealer food storage thingies, or using up your well-wrapped frozen food on a regular basis.|`|vNi14C7uaa	When food is in the freezer for long amounts of time and little air holes are in the bag.

so9M313daa	Depends on what state you are in. In Pennsylvania where it comes from you can probably get it at any beer distributor. In other states, you may want to see if you can find a specialty store for beers in your region that could order it for you or even have it.    The brewery actually has their distributors online: http://yuengling.com/distrib.htm -- but if you are not on the east coast, you seem to be out of luck and should probably get him a different kind of beer.|`|qpxPW5paaa	Shipping alcohol is tricky legally, every state is different. your best bet is try your local liquor store they will be more than happy to order you one.
7c28602891bc1a70b9c329584db2acf2aa	Not really. Not unless you drink Perrier INSTEAD of sugary or fattening drinks like beer, soda, whole milk, milk shakes. In other words, Perrier doesn't have any 'fat burning' or appetite suppressing qualities, but if you cut out all other drinks and drink only Perrier, eventually you'll lose a few pounds.|`|39e96e9e3c0bce02422416332ccfeecbaa	no, it's just mineral water.

Collected taxes, Pot Smokers/dealers (not) going to prison, DEA enforcement, savings from the criminal courts.....etc|`|7cUDstdjaa	No because they would tax it.|`|39e96e9e3c0bce02422416332ccfeecbaa	yes, but the extent it went down would probably depend on the quality.  even though the govt. would tax the hell out of it, marijuana is easy enough to grow on your own that there would be a plentiful supply from private growers, just like now.  the reason it would be slightly cheaper is that the risk associated with growing it would be gone, so you could get low-quality dope for very very cheap, but pot is like anything else, you get what you pay for.  the good growers who use good strains and do quality work could charge more for their product|`|uJDPFp1Raa	Even if they taxed it, it wouldn't necessarily make it cost more. Who knows how much the government would charge. Why would they base their prices off the same things dealers do? That's a stupid assumption. I think the price would go down (even with taxes) because they would have to stay competitive with all the people that have been selling it illegally and would continue to do so.|`|479182125f393fcf9723202d1fa6b1dbaa	I would guess it would go up.

The sponge conforms to the grill and gets into those grooves nicely and the heat and water sort of steams the mess right off of the grill plates.
v4vQSzu4aa	It's called an flour, egg wash and breading setup. Marinating your Fried Chicken in seasoned buttermilk for 24 hours makes the ultimate home fried chicken, but a seasoned flour bath (flour and your seasonings) egg wash (lightly mixed fresh eggs and some hot sauce) and a breading station (breadcrumbs and your seasonings) with a deep pan full of Vegetable Oil brought to 375 degrees.  Easily drop the chicken into the hot oil and let it have it's space in between pieces, after about 15 minutes, take it out and put onto a paper toweled plate.  Then, bake it in the oven at 400 degrees for another 20 minutes (internal temperature should read 165) and then let it rest for 10 minutes under a "tin foil tent".  Yes, really good fried chicken does take a couple of steps but is well worth its labor  in taste and love!|`|AA10106218	a bowl of flour and another bowl of egss and milk whisked together.

It is simple and taste similar but BETTER then KFC/Popeyes.  Its IMPORTANT to use self rising flour.  I tried both regular and self rising and the self rising made a HUGE difference!!  I was worried about the hot red pepper sauce as I have small children and thought it may be too hot, but it isnt.  It doesnt have any "heat" only flavor, its amazing!!  The longer the chicken can sit in the house seasonings and egg mixture the better.  I soak then over night if I have the time.    3 eggs   1 cup hot red pepper sauce   2 cups self-rising flour   2 1/2 pound chicken, cut into pieces       House Seasoning, recipe follows       Oil, for frying, preferably peanut oil       Heat the oil to 350 degrees F in a deep pot. Do not fill the pot more than 1/2 full with oil.   In a medium size bowl, beat the eggs. Add enough hot sauce so the egg mixture is bright orange (about 1 cup). Season the chicken with the House Seasoning. Dip the seasoned chicken in the egg, and then coat well in the flour. Place the chicken in the preheated oil and fry the chicken in the oil until brown and crisp. Dark meat takes longer than white meat. Approximate cooking time is 13 to 14 minutes for dark meat and 8 to 10 minutes for white meat.         House Seasoning:   1 cup salt   1/4 cup pepper   1/4 cup garlic powder       To make the House Seasoning, mix the ingredients together and store in an air-tight container for up to 6 months.|`|xmr7W8ndaa	Here is a technique taught by Alton Brown on "Good Eats".    Make a spice rub with paprika, salt and pepper and sprinkle over the moist chicken parts.  Then dredge the wet chicken in flower.  Shake off excess.    Southern technique is to re-moisten and dredge again for extra thick crust.    Here is the tip:  Set the chicken on a wire rack for about 3 minutes to let the flour firm up or it may simply slide off the chicken in the skillet.|`|Q4oPyclQaa	It's flour with spices.  Usually you soak the chicken in buttermilk first and that makes it moist and gives it flavour and allows the coating to stick.

In a brown paper lunch bag, combine the flour, salt, and pepper. Shake two chicken pieces in the bag to coat, and place them in the skillet. Repeat until all of the chicken is coated and in the skillet.   Fry the chicken over medium-high heat until all of the pieces have been browned on both sides. Turn the heat to medium-low, cover, and cook for 25 minutes. Remove the lid, and increase heat to medium-high. Continue frying until chicken pieces are a deep golden brown, and the juices run clear.|`|n9OJVVsdaa	Its flour salt pepper and egg.  dip the chicken in the egg, plop it in the flour salt and pepper mix and fry that bad boy up in a pan with a little oil.

v4vQSzu4aa	Yes, of course! You can always use a "slurry" which is cold water and corn starch whisked together or you could add in some mashed potatoes to thicken it, or use an emulsion blender and grind up half of your soup, thereby creating a natural based thickener without taking away from the flavor of your Delicious Potato Cream soup recipe.  I prefer the mashed potato method (using leftovers, love that) or using the emulsion blender way. Matter of fact, when I make my Creamy Potato Soup, I always save a small amount of potatoes on the side, just for this purpose.  Hope this helps you out today!  Happy Cooking to you!|`|K7uL2OxLaa	use corn starch or tapioca|`|zXavPbXfaa	The potatoes will naturally thicken it up a bit.    Or if you're not that patient, you can mash a bit of the potatoes (or additional potatoes) and add that.    Or for yet another option, you can use a hand-held blender to cream everything together, which will thicken it.|`|c09015d055d4ed9fd5940c775d1850a4aa	You could use cornstarch instead. Eliminate the flour. Stir some cornstarch into COLD milk. Stir until its smooth. Add to the soup at the end, stirring as you add it. I would do it in small amounts. It will thicken as it gets hotter. You can also increase the potatoes and mash some of them up after they are cooked and stir them back in. Know that using cornstarch can make the soup thin out over time. You wouldn't need the butter either.|`|I40vnqNyaa	The potato should thicken it somewhat.  I would throw in a handful of small pasta somewhere near the beginning, once they are cooked they will start to thicken your recipe.  I add pasta to my chicken and veggie soup etc and that does the trick for me.  You can use those tiny ones that look like rice or something slightly larger, if you put the larger ones (not too big) in early enough they will disappear altogether, but the small ones will stay in tact.  Hope this helps :)|`|4tFuosueaa	Cornstarch works much better than flour for thickening and it doesn't get lumpy. You can dissolve it in the water or the milk either one (cold) . Just stir it up in the measuring cup and add it to the rest just like the recipe calls for. You may or may not need more than 5 tablespoons. Hope that works better for you.|`|DoHaUEziaa	If you don't want to use the flour/butter/milk method, try using instant mashed potatoes.

Ax54M1Dhaa	Wow there are a lot of answers.  The name of the dish comes directly from the wine that is used to cook it.  Marsala is a specific type of Italian sweet red (though Oro Marsala has a  golden color) wine that is similar to Port and found easily in most mega-marts.  It's usually in a small section of other specialty wines.  You can sub other wines but if they are not sweet then the dish will be substantially different.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsala_win...|`|rNIFQKF9aa	Are you wondering what to pair with this or how to make it.  use marsala wine to make this it has a distinct flavor  if you want to pair this I like a crisp california chenin blanc white wine   or an unoaked Australian chardonnay|`|htAuzn9faa	marsala wine! silly|`|XL9CUrp2aa	I use white, whatever I have on hand.

ewUQuX4Kaa	Depends on the seafood...  Seared Ahi Tuna is amazing with a chocolate stout like Arcadia Cocoa Loco or Young's Double Chocolate Stout.  Fried fish tend to go well with English-style pale ales and ESBs.  Oysters are a perfect match for Dry Stouts.  Hefeweizens pair nicely with mild fish like Mahi Mahi or Halibut.  If it's a smoked fish, try a smoked porter.  Most shellfish are awesome with Saisons or Witbiers.  Mussels need a real spicy Wit or a real funky Farmhouse Ale  If you can get Jolly Pumpkin beers in your area, I really recommend their Weizen Bam with a grilled swordfish steak.|`|a5Y0nQf0aa	One cold glass of Samuel Adams light or Boston Lager.|`|MOjHSquwaa	Yuengling, baby!|`|zB1QjEZyaa	Abita Amber|`|S4aii3OJaa	A Heffie with some fresh lemon.|`|b37f2b23a440d20ba2b99b465d00d138aa	whatever you like is the best|`|TlC90cKxaa	try ale

u4liwDhAaa	My humble suggestion is to take your hubby out to a sushi bar on his birthday!  It's a win/win situation because you won't have to do any clean up.  You'll both enjoy the evening!|`|4Pk6VNftaa	Go to a sushi bar that has the plates on little boats or conveyor belt that move by your seat.<br>  <br>  If you see something that looks interesting, just grab the plate.  Prices usually range from $2-5 per plate.  If you don't like it, eh, at least you tried it.  They have little picture menus so you can identify the more common types of sushi, and the chefs behind the bar are always willing to help customers (be sure you tip well - part of your tip goes directly to the sushi chef.)<br>  <br>  If you aren't sure about trying raw fish right off, start out with some of the other types, like a kappa roll, which is just cucumber rolled in rice and seaweed.  California Roll is a favorite, which is a mixture of (imitation) crab with some mayo, a slice of avocado, rolled up and sprinkled with sesame seeds.  <br>  <br>  Try a tempura shrimp roll.  This is large shrimp, dipped in batter and fried, then rolled in rice and sliced up.  If you like shrimp cocktail, there's also uncooked shrimp sushi (ebi).  For a treat, try the "sweet shrimp" sushi (ama ebi).  It's a bit more expensive, but oh-so-tasty.  <br>  <br>  There's also tamago, which is a type of sweet omelet laid on some rice. <br>  <br>  When you're ready to move onto the fish, try the tuna (maguro) and salmon (sake) as those are the ones most folks tend to like.<br>  <br>  I also like unagi, which is a type of eel that's been cooked and coated with a type of Japanese BBQ sauce.  It's very tender.<br>  <br>  I also like squid (ika).  If you like fried calamari, give this a try.  It tastes much the same, but is a bit chewier.  Octopus (tako) is also somewhat similar to squid.<br>  <br>  Many sushi restaurants have specialty sushi as well.  Once you feel comfortable with the basics, feel free to try these.  For instance, many places serve a "Philadelphia Roll" which is salmon, cream cheese, maybe some avocado, rolled up in rice and seaweed.  Sometimes they'll use smoked salmon instead of raw.<br>  <br>  Again, don't hesitate to ask the sushi chef questions.  That's why he's there (well, and to keep making sushi).  Don't see something you want to try?  Ask the chef.  Want to know what's fresh?  Ask the chef.  Don't know what that is?  Ask the chef.|`|7iPKgy5Caa	I think you should give it a try you might fall in love with it !!! I suggest you start on basic stuff first tho.|`|UDl8Ac76aa	You should try, since your husband likes it so much. If you can't stand on raw food, you can also get sushi that doesn't topped with raw fish. You can try inari sushi, sushi fusion roll, ebi sushi. If you can eat raw, I suggest try ootoro (the most exclusive tuna), tobiko sushi (flying fish roe sushi), ikura sushi (salmon roe), unagi sushi (eel). Sushi is just delicious and fresh. There's too many. Suggest you eat kaiten sushi (sushi shop that used bar and the sushi go around, you can pick it as you wish)|`|0NSax0u9aa	Use Ahi (tuna) the fresher the better, ask at a seafood market if they have sushi grade if not just get regular ahi. This is the best fish to try first if you've haven't had sushi before|`|qeOlkRM0aa	Sure, why not?<br>  I think you should try all sorts of new stuff for your husband's birthday. :-)|`|5Rlxcw6Maa	If this is your first time i suggest you try something that is cooked like: Spicy Tuna Tempura.which has spicy tuna inside and then deep fried with a tempura coating. But if spicy food is not good you can try a crunch Roll which has crab meat, shrimp tempura  and cucumber inside covered with bread crumbs. These two would be a great stater for a first timer i got hooked with the spicy tuna tempura either way enjoy.|`|IED3yNqEaa	YES! sushi is awesome. and it always tastes better when you make it yourself.. also you know how fresh all the ingredients are. im sure there is a very decent website out there with heaps of different recipies. May i suggest Kingfish, oily and yum

Take iron supplements.<br>  If you don't like tablets i think fish is a good source. Just look up foods that are high in iron.|`|xNkmK0SHaa	Organ meats and some green vegetables increase RBC's.<br>  Liquids increase blood volume.<br>  <br>  A normal period does not change the blood volume or composition.|`|W0UXXrasaa	Beets can help. But your blood cells have natural cell divisions called Mitosis. And the nucleus really controls that. Not foods.|`|Bs0vL6SMaa	Main concern for women with with heavy or prolonged periods is not loss of blood but loss of iron. Red meat is good for replacing iron but the body needs good level s of Vitamin C to be able to absorb Iron from food also.

Makes about 2 dozen, depending on how big you make your cookies.    -------------  Alternatively, you can press chocolate kisses into the peanut butter cookies when they're still soft from the oven -- the kisses will set into the cookies, and that is also delicious.

The second batch I substituted the 1/2 cup + 1/4 cup sugar for dark brown sugar and put the chocolate kisses after the first 8 min. These were very yummy but also pretty sweet.  The 3rd batch which was everyones favorite, I substituted 1/2 cup sugar for honey and 1/4 cup sugar for dark brown sugar, I put the kisses on after 8 minutes. The last batch was using 3/4 cups brown sugar total in batter and with out sugar coating them. Try just brown sugar (4th batch) or with honey (3rd batch). Those were my families favorites.

Remove from oven; press a chocolate kiss candy into the center of each cookie. Return to oven and bake another 2 minutes or until cookies are light brown. Remove from oven and remove from cookie sheet; let cookies cool on wire racks.? ? Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove from oven and immediately press a chocolate kiss into the center of each cookie (cookie will crack around edges). Remove from cookie sheet and let cookies cool on wire racks.   Yields 4 dozen cookies.   Good luck, have fun, and enjoy!|`|Q4oPyclQaa	My favourite recipe for peanut butter chocolate chip cookies is very simple and it takes longer to preheat the oven than make these.  I have made these a million times.    1 cup of natural peanut butter  1/2 cup of sugar (any kind you like, so free to use brown sugar)  1 egg  1 cup of chocolate chips (or more or less if you like)    Mix together the peanut butter and sugar.  Then add the egg and stir until it forms a dough.  Add the chocolate chips and stir until combined.  Flatten on a cookie sheet thick if you like soft cookies and thin if you like crunchy cookies.  Bake 8-10 minutes at 350 degrees.  Less time if they are thinner and more time if they are thicker. Makes about a dozen cookies.    Beware that they are impossible to remove from the sheet when they first come out of the oven because they are so soft, but as they cool they will firm up.|`|zn0pXkc0aa	Why don't you make Peanut butter cookies and put chocolate chips in the dough. I'd probably use a soft peanut butter cookie recipe rather than a crisp one.|`|zXavPbXfaa	You could try to use just the brown sugar in place of white.   It has a bit more flavor and moisture to it, so they'll taste just a bit different that your usual cookie.|`|f3SyOyMEaa	Go to recipes.com.

Q4oPyclQaa	Capsaicin is the chemical contained in hot peppers which is the cause of the burning sensation.    Capsaicin stimulates the rerceptors in your skin that react to heat - and makes your skin believe that it is being burned (despite not being actually burned).  It isn't just your mouth that burns from capsaicin - your entire skin, or anywhere that has heat receptors (basically any part of your body that can feel temperature) will react to it.    We find it somewhat pleasant to eat foods that do this - why we like it, I have no idea, since it's really irritating if you get hot pepper juice on your hands when you are cutting them - or your EYES! Man that burns!  It hurts so bad!  We are the only animal that likes capsaicin.  It's meant to be a deterrent to being eaten- it's a plant's natural defense.    Some animals don't detect the capsaicin and will simply eat it anyway.|`|AUXhLUUsaa	because it is hot
4b81a16cbb26c3702aa40a16058d31e4aa	All I have is a fix until you find your materials...  If you have cigars and they are drying out, you can simply put them in a 9"x13" tupperware or rubbermaid container.  In one of the corners and so it doesn't touch the cigars, put a 1"x1"x1" cube of a moist sponge in the corner.  Wha-la!  Makeshift humidor.    As for proper humidity - I use distilled water in my humidor for the last ten years and it works just fine.

0ujpiBTCaa	Once you have given up dairy for a while, you will realize how gross it is an never crave it. I haven't had cheese/etc in years now and I can't even imagine eating that stuff..even when I smell it...ugh!  Besides, if your diet is interesting enough, a little self control is all you need.    Food choices? Endless!  Tonight I had a Mediterranean lentil stew and whole wheat pita with hummus and a fresh salad.    Last night I had black beans, mixed veggies(corn, red and green peppers, avocado and salsa fresca on brown rice.    The night before eggplant cutlets, marinara sauce, and garlic tofu. On the side I had Sauteed Spinach and homemade garlic bread.      You won't run out of options, you can eat anything that didn't come from an animal!    Sami:Check your list, lots of problems.  TUNA IS NOT EVEN VEGETARIAN. Never mind vegan.   She doesn't eat dead animals.    Edit:  Many people lose some weight, but not everyone. How much will depend on your diet before and after.

I would be tempted to eat dairy products if I lived with non-vegans, but I still wouldn't eat it.

If you need some "extras" you can add some dried fruit like bananas or fics - if you like salted, you can eat with chips of carrots or roasted peas.

Zucchini Slice    375g Zucchini  1 large onion  3 rashers bacon  1 cup grated cheddar cheese  1 cup self-raising flour  1/2 cup of oil  5 eggs  salt and pepper    Grate unpeeled zucchini coarsely, finely chop onion and bacon.  combine zucchini, onion, bacon, cheese, sifted flour, oil and lightly beaten eggs, season with salt and papper.  Pour into well greased lamington tin (base measures 16cm x 26cm), bake in moderate oven 30 to 40 minutes or until browned.  serves 4 to 6  This can be served with salad as a meal or cut into small pieces and served on a plate as finger food.  We all love this one.     Quick zucchini quiche    (if you have  frozen breadcrumbs on hand, this is as quick a quiche as you will find)    1 cup wholemeal breadcrumbs  5 small zucchini  1 small onion  1 clove garlic  4 eggs  300ml jar cream  3 tablespoons grated parmesan cheese  1 cup grated cheddar cheese  1 tablespoon self-raising flour  salt and pepper  1 large tomato    Spread crumbs evenly over base of well greased 25cm flan dish or pie plate (do not use flan tin with removable base).  Combine coarsely grated unpeeled zucchini, chopped onion and crushed garlic, add lightly beaten eggs, cream, both cheeses and flour, mix well.  season with salt and pepper, spoon gently over crumbs, top with sliced tomato.  Bake in moderate oven 45 minutes.     zucchini & cherry tomato tartlets (These are great too)    4 sheets of short crust pastry, thawed  300g (10oz) zucchini, grated  2 eggs, lightly beaten  150g (5oz) ricotta  70g (2 1/2oz) parmesan, grated  handful of fresh basil, chopped  2 tbs pine nuts, toasted  sea salt and pepper  12 large or 16 small cherry tomatoes    preheat oven to 180C (350F), Grease four individual pie tins.    Use a plate approx 17cm in diameter to use as a template to cut four circles of pastry.  place the dough over a pie tin and ease it into the tin.     combine all of the remaining ingredients except cherry tomatoes in a large bowl and mix well to combine.    Spoon the zucchini mixture into the pie tins then place tomatoes on top of each tartlet, pressing them in slightly.  Fold the overhanging pastry in towards the middle of the tartlets, gathering it a little as necessary.    Place the tartlets on a tray and bake for 40-45 mins, or until the zuccini filling has set and browned a little, and the tomatoes are a little bit shrivelled.  Remove from oven and allow to cool.

AA10928232	When you are gathering your crust bits into a ball to chill, sort of pat out, then fold in half.  Pat out again, then fold in half the other way.  This creates layers.  Chill, then roll out... be sure not to stretch when placing into pie crust.  And if filling an already baked crust, weight the crust w/ dry peas or beans or pie weights in a parchment liner, so it doesn't puff up.|`|zn0pXkc0aa	I am no professional, although I have worked as a cook and a baker, and I have made a lot of pies through the years for my family.    It sounds like you need more liquid in your crust. Pie crust tends to crumble when dry. It's tricky to get the moisture content just right.    I re-read your question and have to admit I misread your question. The other answers are better.    Most pie dough cracks when rolling out due to lack of moisture. Cracking while baking usually means you stretched the dough out too much. You need to gently fit the pie crust in the pan and weight it down with pie weights, etc.|`|i7DKiaHBaa	Because you suck at cooking, take up knitting|`|AA11537580	poke a few small holes in it with a fork before baking|`|Ny79udz1aa	Sounds as if you're making it too wet to start with.

zXavPbXfaa	I love traditional tiramisu, but it's not always that easy to find the good quality ingredients necessary.    I made this cake for my sister's birthday last week and she said it's not her favorite cake and my brother-in-law already requested it for HIS birthday in April.    Tastes JUST like tiramisu.     INGREDIENTS (Nutrition)        * CAKE:      * 1 (18.25 ounce) package moist white cake mix      * 1 teaspoon instant coffee powder      * 1/4 cup coffee      * 1 tablespoon coffee flavored liqueur      *        * FILLING:      * 1 (8 ounce) container mascarpone cheese      * 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar      * 2 tablespoons coffee flavored liqueur      *        * FROSTING:      * 2 cups heavy cream      * 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar      * 2 tablespoons coffee flavored liqueur      *        * GARNISH:      * 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder      * 1 (1 ounce) square semisweet chocolate        * add to recipe box Add to Recipe Box        My folders:      * add to shopping list Add to Shopping List      * Customize Recipe      * add a personal note Add a Personal Note    DIRECTIONS       1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour 3 (9 inch) pans.     2. Prepare the cake mix according to package directions. Divide two thirds of batter between 2 pans. Stir instant coffee into remaining batter; pour into remaining pan.     3. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely. In a measuring cup, combine brewed coffee and 1 tablespoon coffee liqueur; set aside.     4. To make the filling: In a small bowl, using an electric mixer set on low speed, combine mascarpone, 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar and 2 tablespoons coffee liqueur; beat just until smooth. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate.     5. To make the frosting: In a medium bowl, using an electric mixer set on medium-high speed, beat the cream, 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar and 2 tablespoons coffee liqueur until stiff. Fold 1/2 cup of cream mixture into filling mixture.     6. To assemble the cake: Place one plain cake layer on a serving plate. Using a thin skewer, poke holes in cake, about 1 inch apart. Pour one third of reserved coffee mixture over cake, then spread with half of the filling mixture. Top with coffee-flavored cake layer; poke holes in cake. Pour another third of the coffee mixture over the second layer and spread with the remaining filling. Top with remaining cake layer; poke holes in cake. Pour remaining coffee mixture on top. Spread sides and top of cake with frosting. Place cocoa in a sieve and lightly dust top of cake. Garnish with chocolate curls. Refrigerate at least 30 minutes before serving.     7. To make the chocolate curls, use a vegetable peeler and run it down the edge of the chocolate bar.        NOTE:  Where the recipe calls for anything coffee-flavored (granules, coffee, liquor, etc.) I always TRIPLED the amount given.  I read nearly a hundred reviews and most people found that tripling the coffee gave it the perfect coffee flavor without being overbearing.  That's my advice.|`|zn0pXkc0aa	It's not that difficult to make and you can make the ladyfingers from scratch. Sponge cake fingers should work in a pinch.    Tiramisu  1 cup whipping (heavy) cream  1 ounce) (8 pa cream cheese at room temperature  ? cup powdered sugar  2 tablespoons light rum  OR  ? teaspoon rum extract  1 ounce) (3 pa ladyfingers (12 ladyfingers)  ? cup cold prepared espresso or strong coffee  2 teaspoons baking cocoa  Maraschino cherries with stems for garnish, if desired  Pour the whipping cream into a medium bowl, and place in the refrigerator  to chill. The cream will whip better in a cold bowl.    Beat the cream cheese and powdered sugar in another medium bowl with the  electric mixer on medium speed until smooth. Beat in the rum on low speed,  and set aside.    Beat the whipping cream on high speed until stiff peaks form. Gently spoon  the whipped cream onto the cream cheese mixture. To fold together, use a  rubber spatula to cut down vertically through the mixtures, then slide the  spatula across the bottom of the bowl and up the side, turning the  mixtures over. Rotate the bowl one-fourth turn, and repeat this  down-across-up motion. Continue mixing in this way just until ingredients  are blended.    Split each ladyfinger horizontally in half. Arrange half of them, cut  sides up, over the bottom of the ungreased pan. Drizzle 1/4 cup of the  cold espresso over the ladyfingers. Spread half of the cream cheese  mixture over ladyfingers.    Arrange the remaining ladyfingers, cut sides up, over the cream cheese  mixture. Drizzle with the remaining 1/4 cup cold espresso, and spread with  the remaining cream cheese mixture.    Sprinkle the cocoa over the top of the dessert. If you have a small  strainer, place the cocoa in the strainer and shake it over the dessert.  Otherwise, shake the cocoa from a spoon. Cover and refrigerate about 4  hours or until the filling is firm. Garnish each serving with a cherry.    ++++++++++++++++++++    Please note, if you should change this recipe it will no longer be an  approved Betty Crocker? Recipe.

QHttGu6naa	Grocery stores have heating and air conditioning, just like your home does. Even though your front door opens and closes and you let in the cold or heat, your heating or a/c work to keep your home at an average temperature. If it starts to get too cold, your heater kicks in to get it back up to that temperature, and it's the same with grocery stores.    As for the freezer sections, the cold is focused to the containers that hold the food, while the heater heats the area around it.    Trust me though, sometimes the people that work at the registers WANT to wear coats. Gusts of cold air do come in occasionally, and it's almost painful when you get a gust of 30-degree air when you're used to 70-degree.    Edit:    The only difference would be the double set of doors. When you go through the first door from the outside into the small hall, the heating or a/c is blasting into it, keeping it extra warm or cool. When you enter the main store, that hot or cool air overpowers the air outside, to keep it from entering the store as well (in most cases).|`|Q4oPyclQaa	You see there's this magical invention called heating...    There are also "airlocks" in most grocery stores.  They have one door, and then another door, so that the cold air doesn't come directly rushing in when people come in.|`|AA10625089	Heat, just like your house. Well, my store uses a boiler system. I live in Michigan and I have been wearing long underwear to work every day this winter because it gets really cold (even with the heat on) with the doors opening and closing all the time.    BTW we use air conditioning in the summer.

About thirteen and a half to fourteen percent of each kernel is made up of water. So when a popcorn kernel is heated above the boiling point of 212 degrees Fahrenheit, this water turns to steam. This steam creates pressure within the kernel, causing the kernel to explode and turn itself inside out.|`|kNvbkZHIaa	Hi    Try here.    Cya  :)|`|eJy5Tj4Kaa	Within minutes, a teardrop-shaped kernel no larger than a pea can magically mushroom into a fluffy treat that's at least 35 times its original volume.     The tasty secret: water.     Each popcorn kernel contains a hard outer shell and a starchy inside surrounding a dab of water. When the kernels are heated to about 450 degrees Fahrenheit, the pocket of water turns into steam and expands within the tough casing. Like blowing up a balloon, as more and more steam forms, the pressure against the outer shell increases. When shell can no longer contain the building pressure and finally gives way with the classic pop. The kernel turns inside-out, revealing the softened starch that makes up the white spongy part of your favorite movie snack.|`|6hnEhNcQaa	Expanding steam both cooks and breaks open the kernel.|`|YPNIbZrTaa	Within minutes, a teardrop-shaped kernel no larger than a pea can magically mushroom into a fluffy treat that's at least 35 times its original volume.

When it gets hot it expands.  It starts to boil, but its trapped in the shell or kernel of the corn.  It pops and cooks the entire kernel as it trys to escape.  The steam escaping breaks the shell and cooks the kernel.  Because of the steam escaping you get pop corn in return.    It has to do with water left in the kernel.|`|ZuvWwx4raa	because it is called POPcorn lol!!!!!!!!!!!
18d121d01c136ac0f12ff28e4139c812aa	You can make your own. I got a recipe from ther web site:  Old-Fashioned Hot Cocoa   Sip a mug of this warming hot chocolate on a cold winter day!

zawmsUO1aa	To my knowledge, Peter Pan has not been recalled.    Peanut butter is sold by Peanut Corporation of America in bulk containers ranging in size from five (5) to 1,700 pounds.  The peanut paste is sold in sizes ranging from 35-pound containers to product sold by the tanker container.  Neither of these products is sold directly to consumers.     However, through its investigation, FDA has determined that PCA distributed potentially contaminated product to more than 70 consignee firms, for use as an ingredient in hundreds of different products, such as cookies, crackers, cereal, candy and ice cream.     Major national brands of jarred peanut butter found in grocery stores are not affected by the PCA recall!

eKtEWrcmaa	Is this just for a treat or for bottle feeding?    if the latter you can google kitten glop and many recipes will come up. straight goats milk will not be sufficient on its own.    KMR is completely safe to use. I work in kitten rescue and have used it many times. My current kitten was on it for 8 weeks and is fine. I doubt there is a very high demand for natural organic kitten formula and prices would be sky high if it were available.     If the ingredients in kitten glop are ferret safe I'd think it would work fine. Its usually a bit higher in calories than KMR so less is needed in each meal.

If you want to eat something so poor of life energy in this soup or ramen, to not kill a chicken, all right; but if you are interested in a healthy food don't eat this. You can cook rapidlly some vegetables with spices by your own with pepper, shoyu and some herbs...   If you want to keep the poor chickens out of slaughter and your meals as 0,001% (powder of chicken) you do good too! - why you are so worried about if has chicken...  Is better you convince someone else to do your meals with less than 50% of meat - of any kind !  Other reasons is spiritual or religious and the body naturally rejects this kind of meals, but in this case you will need energy pure from natural alive vegs or seeds - I personally, reject onions and garlic too, my body processes very bad this two, because of the odor that remains in the body...  I'd preffer more to be free in the mind, you know, how you could do better, in a irracional 100% meat free that causes paranoid and criticism or use your energy inteligently when you choose harmoniously and in certain conditions or situations what the energy of the meals and what to eat for the better of the people around you - not only the animals.

And so do a lot of other foods you wouldn't necessarily expect like:  jello  chewy candies  most tooth pastes- get organic :)  disposable cameras  and a lot of the times if something contains trans fats or saturated fats then that means it has meat in it.    Don't worry about it too much though, if your just starting out being a veggie then i'd suggest eating some animal products so your body can get used to it. And eat TOFU and ummm... and try au-naturel veggie chicken nuggets there amazing and zogo's has an ok vegetarian line. And the good thing about tofu is that it absorbs the flavors it's cooked with!

teIblDHiaa	Well to me it sounds like a decent amount of calories, but maybe not enough considering your activity level. If you see that you are losing weight, then I would increase the calorie intake. 5'3 and 120 sounds like a great weight to me, so I think you should keep it that way.    In terms of how healthy your diet is, I'd say it's not as healthy as it could be. For instance, I don't recommend eating cold breakfast cereals in general because I've done A LOT of research on them and came to the conclusion that they are not healthy for you at all. Also, FROSTED mini wheats are full of sugar. Plus the brownie and it's a sugar disaster. I would recommend eating a generous bowl of oatmeal cooked in milk for extra protein and topped  fruit, nuts, and a small drizzle of honey for some natural sweetness. This breakfast is high in good-quality whole-grains, healthy fats, protein, and vitamin and mineral rich fruit and nuts.    As for your lunch, it sounds good. Make sure your bread is whole-grain though. Also, go light on the jelly. I like to used sliced banana instead because it's natural and tastes just as great, maybe even better! Also, I would try to get in a vegetable into this meal. How about adding carrot and/or celery sticks?    You're snack is not so great. I don't consider a coffee drink a snack as the caffeine present in the coffee negates the calcium you get from the milk. Plus the sugar and it goes into the unhealthy territory. So I would recommend eating maybe a peice of fruit and a handful of nuts instead for a healthy carb-protein combo. Or try a fruit yogurt smoothie! They taste great.    Dinner sounds good. You have a carb (noodles), a protein (beef sauce). and a veggie (green beans). The milk sounds like a good idea too because you need extra calories in your case since you do strenuous exercises. Make sure the meat is lean though, and don't overcook the green beans (make sure they're still green).     Dessert is obviously not healthy, but its perfectly okay to have your cake once in a while! Just make sure you don't do it every night. Try fruit instead.    Sounds good overall, just needs some improvement. To sum up your diet flaws in one sentence: It's too low in fruit and veggies, too low in whole-grains (assuming that bread and noodles were white), and too high in sugar and unhealthy fats.|`|AA11402528	lol id eat more if i was you. especially more meat for protein.|`|hpX4up0maa	UM well of course!! so you're sure click the link below:|`|iwPH0xR0aa	wow that is a lot|`|CDVWnF7Laa	your diet looks like you are getting plenty of fiber which is good, but i wouldnt consider cappucino a "snack" lol... and just make sure you drink a cup of water after every caffeinated beverage, because caffeine really dehydrates you which can lead to sluggish blood flow.    I'd say generally though, your diet looks healthy and like you should be getting the vitamins and everything you need everyday. Maybe try drinking more water?    Just ask yourself how you feel everyday. If you feel sluggish and fatigued its probably from your diet. On the other hand, if you feel great, it's probably from your diet as well :)|`|AA11537580	no it is not the best foods for a runner!!  you need more food then that  more protein  more fruit and veggies    try this  BF..

20e6716e7b69edd68a6925b973be380caa	You may want to try what I call chick beers, some examples are Petes Strawberry Blonde or Cherry Wheat. There is also a beer made by Woodchuck that has a apple cider taste to it. Next time you go the store check out the section with al the micro brews and you may just find something you like.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Why force yourself? I can't stand beer but I still drink. Why do you need to drink beer? I think you feel pressured by your boyfriend which means you have low self esteem.|`|mo8YBvC4aa	keep drinking it and try to acquire a taste for it|`|rsTB7D1zaa	Here, this will help.  <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/style" rel="nofollow">http://beeradvocate.com/beer/style</a>  .  It is a list of every style of beer.  If you do hate all beer, then you will have had a beer from each style :)<br>  <br>  Check out some of the styles that sound more interesting to you.  If you've *only* had the American pale lager then I do not blame you; it is not a good style of beer.  <br>  <br>  Some of my common suggestions would be the easy to drink beers, such as Brown ales (Newcastle is easy to find; not the best in the style, but good), pale ales (Sierra Nevada is necessary, Bass is a poor choice).  I particularly enjoy the Schwarzbier (Sam Adams Black Lager).  In a more popular lager-sense, the American light lager is supposed to be a version of the Czech or German Pilsner.  The best examples from this would probably be Pilsner Urquell (the first Pilsner), and Victory PrimaPils (made in PA).  For hoppier beers, look to American IPAs.  For malts, turn to the stouts and porters.  Sam Adams Cream Stout is sweeter than most beers (as well as pitch black).  Drink black coffee?  Try Founder's Breakfast Stout, made with coffee and it's pretty obvious.  <br>  <br>  Anyways, if you've only had things like Bud, Bud Light, Coors, Miller, LaBatt, Heineken, Amstel, Carlsberg, Corona, Red Stripe then I wouldn't be surprised if you hate it.  And I also wouldn't be surprised if you thought this was "all beer" -- these beers make up over 80% of beer sales in the US, probably more.  And they're all the same style!  How disappointing.  Maybe you simply prefer real beers?  Experiment.  (If Troegs is available in your area -- PA, its neighboring states and MA -- then pick up the 12 pack; has a brown ale, pale ale, really good amber ale and an american wheat ale [tastes like bananas and clove, kinda funky]).|`|aBpEPOCdaa	Well its an aquired taste.  <br>  <br>  I am a female and I like beer, but I like good beer.<br>  <br>  Kilkenny Irish cream ale is very smooth and its my favourite.<br>  <br>  I also love (and can't get in Canada) Yuengling original served very cold.<br>  <br>  Give them a try and if you don't like those, what about Corona or a lighter version?<br>  <br>  Good luck and if you don't like, that's cool|`|S0XArokKaa	Ok, I really didnt like beer until about two months ago. What I did was;  I drank beer like once a week but I held it in my mouth so my tastebud got used to it and I did that until I liked it. I also found a beer witch I liked; Red Stripe or Miller GD. Good luck.|`|t4xE1eibaa	there are literally hundreds of beers available.  There are dark, heavy, light, fruity, dry, smokey, herby, rich, sweet, bitter, cheap, expensive ect ect types of beer out there.  There has just got to be one for you.  Maybe you just dont like what you BF and his friends drink.  I suggest trial and error with mirco brews and imports.  .  Good hunting!|`|Tv48MqWmaa	My best advice is to find a beer tasting around your town and go and experiment!

This is because it increases the acid in your stomach which will aid in digestion. Also, spicy foods do the same thing.

One thing to remember is that restaurants tend to be a little lax on their sanitation when it comes to things like lemon wedges for drinks.

cLa7nwhcaa	Technically they are legumes.    http://www.indiacurry.com/soups/s001back...  Legume Origin Varieties  The plant belongs to the family Leguminosae (legume). The fruit of the plant is a pod containing seeds. These seeds are called Legume.   The seeds are  believed to be native to South Western Asia and Northern Syria. Archaeological evidence dates back the cultivation to  6,000 B.C. Seeds found in Egyptian tombs date back to 2400 B.C. During the Neolithic period, they spread to Greece and Bulgaria. During the Bronze Age, they spread to Near East and Mediterranean. The ancient Egyptians considered seeds to be essential to support life. The Greeks and Romans offered them to Gods during worship. Well known Roman families were named after these seeds; Fabius (fava bean), Lentulus (lentil), Piso (pea), and Cicero (chickpea).  Lentils are mentioned 4 times in the bible.  In the first chapter, Jacob gives a bowl of pottage to Esau who forsakes his birthright (Genesis 25: 30-34).  What is a Legume?  By definition, Legume are the dried seeds from a pod that develops from a simple carpel and opens up along its seams on two sides.  Common Legumes include Peanuts, Beans, Peas, Clover and Alfalfa. It should be noted that the seams of the peanuts do not automatically open up when dried. Lentils and Pulse are varieties of Legume.  What are Lentils?  Lentils belong to legume family. The seeds are shaped like small flat round disks. They are available in a wide variety of colors; orange, black, green. The most common variety is Brown Lentil (Masoor). Brown Lentil are available in most of the American Grocery stores.  What are Grams?  This is left-over term from the British Raj. British called the unfamiliar Legume as Gram and  identified them by either the color or the place of use.  What are Pulse?  The Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) defines  Pulse as an annual leguminous crops yielding from one to 12 seeds within the pod, harvested for the dry seeds. The definition excludes seeds that can used for extracting oil (Soya bean, Peanuts). According to this definition green peas and green beans are vegetable crops and not Pulse.  The definition also excludes seeds grown for the sole purpose of sowing such as Cloves and Alfalfa.    Pulse in India   India is the world's largest producer and consumer of Pulse. The consumption far exceeds the production. This gap is filled with imports from Canada, Myanmar, Australia and USA.  Pulse are normally hulled and split using a multi-step process. First, the seeds are cleaned of dirt and stones. Second, the surfaces is scratched for easier moisture absorption.  Third, the Pulse is soaked in a "water and vegetable  oil" mixture to soften the hull. Fourth, decorticating machines removes the hull. The Pulse may be split. Pulse may also be milled to make flour.  Normally, Pulse is cooked into a thick gray like soup, called Dal and served with Roti (Flat bread) or Rice.    Common Varieties   Desi chickpeas (Desi Chana, Bengal gram)  This the most common variety and is used to make from Dal to various types of snacks. The milled flour is called Besan. Besan is used to make sweets and batter for deep-frying.  Pigeon peas (Arhar, Tuar, Red or Yellow gram)  This almost always hulled and split. Castor oil may be used as a preservative. Red variety is Popular in central and southern India. Yellow variety is common in North India.  Black Matpe (Mah, Urad, Urd, Black gram)  This is popular in all forms, whole, split, as well milled. Punjabis make Buttery Dal from whole Pulse. In UP, hulled split Pulse is used to make Dal. In South India, Idli and Dosa are major dishes.  Mung beans (Moong)  This is popular in all forms, whole, split, as well milled. Popular in eastern India and Maharashtra.  Lentils (Masoor)  Consumed primarily in northern and eastern India.  Green peas  Primarily used to make Dal.  Yellow peas  Popular in Uttar Pradesh, eastern India (West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, and Assam), and southern India.  Garbanzo bean (Kabuli Chana)  This is the larger seed version of Desi Chana. Most popular in Punjab region.  Red Kidney beans (Rajma)  Most popular in Punjab region.  Black-eyed peas (Lobiya)  Consumed in most parts of the country|`|PcQuOmWqaa	Beans.  Very high in protein.  Enjoy!|`|I40vnqNyaa	They are the same thing and they are beans.

The Latin name for garbanzo beans, Cicer arietinum, means "small ram," reflecting the unique shape of this legume that somewhat resembles a ram's head.

Also, I would say they're more like beans.  Peas are more a type of lentil.  Beans and lentils are similar, but kind of different.  Lentils are more easily split.

Cook the pancetta until golden and crisp, about 4 minutes. Meanwhile, season the short ribs with salt and pepper, and dredge in the flour. Using a slotted spoon, remove the pancetta from the pan and set aside. Add the short ribs to the pan and brown on all sides, about 7 minutes total.    Meanwhile, combine the onion, carrot, parsley and garlic in a food processor and blend until finely minced. Then add the tomatoes and tomato paste and pulse.    Once the short ribs are browned, carefully add the mixture from the food processor to the pot. Return the pancetta to the pot and stir. Add the rosemary, thyme, oregano, bay leaf, beef broth, and wine. Bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, covered, for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Remove the lid and simmer for another hour and a half, stirring occasionally. Remove the meat and bones from the pot. Discard the bones. Shred the meat and return it to the pot. Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 3/4 teaspoon pepper, or to taste.    Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the pasta and cook until tender but still firm to the bite, stirring occasionally, about 8 to 10 minutes for dried pasta and 2 to 3 minutes for fresh. Drain the pasta, reserving 1 cup of the cooking liquid. Add the pasta to the pot and stir to combine. Add the reserved pasta liquid 1/4 cup at a time, if    needed, to moisten the pasta. Transfer to serving bowls, top each bowl with 1 teaspoon of chocolate shavings. Serve immediately.        NOTES:    I use country style pork ribs in place of the short ribs with no problem.

You may also use any of the Asian sauces plus some water and a bit of cream, or wine and spices for an Asian influence.  Also try changing from the usual 'Italian pasta' to things like rice noodles, and the other Asian noodles.  Simply 'stir fry' your topping and add some sauce and they are a 'wonderful change' that taste 'similar' but are totally different.  My husband also makes a really tasty 'Cajun pasta' ... the usual pasta with a creamy sauce and 'cajun seasoning' ...|`|XcNoptFbaa	Farfalle with Fresh Tomatoes, Wine, Olives and Golden Raisins          6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided   1 cup julienned red onion   1 tablespoon minced garlic   2 cups peeled, seeded, and diced tomatoes   3/4 cup sliced olives, such as kalamata   1/2 cup golden raisins   1/2 cup dry white wine   2 tablespoons drained capers   1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste   Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper   3/4 pound farfalle or other dry pasta   1/4 cup freshly chopped basil leaves   1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese, for garnish   Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large skillet or saucepan and cook the onions and garlic until very tender, 6 to 8 minutes.

Here's to make them.    1 cup tapioca pearls  8 cups water  some say 7:1 ratio    1) Boil water in a large pot.  2) Add in the tapioca pearls to boiling water.  3) Stir initially to prevent tapioca from sticking to the bottom of the pot. The tapioca pearls should float in the water.  4) Boil for about 25 minutes with the cover on.  5) Turn the heat off and let the tapioca sit in the water for another 25 minutes.    6) Rinse the cooked tapioca pearls in warm water and drain out the water.  7) Cover with bubble tea fructose, sugar syrup, brown sugar whatever syrup so they don't dry out.

In a non-reactive saucepan, combine water and sugar, bringing to a boil. Simmer for 5 minutes, or until sugar is dissolved.    2. As this syrup simmers, zest one of the lemons, and squeeze the juice from both, picking out any seeds but leaving bits of pulp.    3. Add lemon zest, and juice, plus ginger, to syrup, and let steep until cool. (You may strain out the ginger for a smoother texture, but we usually leave it in.)    4. Freeze, according to the directions of your ice cream machine.     If You Don't Have an Ice Cream Machine    Pour the cooled ginger syrup into a stainless steel bowl, and place in the freezer. Let freeze until you have a 2-inch border of ice around the edge of the bowl --- typically this takes 1 1/2 hours or so --- then remove and scrape the frozen parts into the liquid middle, beating well with a whisk (or even an electric beater, if you want a very smooth texture).

gmr6GiyZaa	I think homemade invites are the best ones:    1. Get a bunch of empty CD's and get some adhesive labels that are round that are specifically for printing on CD's. You can get a pack of empty CD's and the round labels at business supply stores.   Print your invite on the label with all the info on it with a computer and than stick on the CD.  If you really want to go all out record your favorite song on the CD too.  I believe you can get CD envelopes at the business supply store too.    2.  Create a brochure like the ones they give out at concerts to show what the groups and songs are going to next.  Put you and your friends pictures that you plan to invite in it through out the years you have know each other.  They will love it.    3.  Get a bunch of wooden drum sticks that kids play toy drums with and roll a flier around it with your printed info on it and tie it up with guitar string or crazy neon animal printed ribbon.     4.  Get a picture of your favorite rock group except cut out their faces and put in yours.  Color copy it and make it the cover of your invitation.    5.  You can make your invite look like a big concert ticket from ticketmaster.  You know the blue striped ones that have  a detachable part.  Put all the info on the party as if it were a rock concert, it would super if you could hire a band and put the name  of the band on the ticket.    6. Here is an more affordable one just cut out some construction paper in the shape of an electric guitar and a hand.

It's probably New Belgium's worst offering.  At best, it's mildly interesting.  At worst, it's not worth the time  or money.  I'd place Fat Tire squarely in the "Not a lot of character,  totally pedestrian" beer category.  Fine if you're looking to "Do Beer,"  but if you're actually looking for a characterful, tasty beer, Fat Tire's  not going to do it.    Check out New Belgium's Blue Paddle Pils to get an idea of what  those people can do in the brewhouse.    If you're on the East Coast and looking for quality beers without the  lame hype, check out Victory Brewing at http://www.victorybeer.com/  Their entire lineup is slammin'.|`|okECVBkzaa	Im from the Bay and Fat Tire is one of my favorites. Ive been drinking New Castle the most lately.|`|iL4irhhkaa	It totally is worth the hype. Not many beers can compare to its smooth and refreshing taste. Plus its got a pretty solid alcohol content. They just recently started selling it east of the mississippi in chicago. I live in Indiana and it's something we lack.|`|21428fc02666515c85c83d64ffb798faaa	You know what...I like it...but its filling...It aint good to drink while eating food...but they sell it at this rib restaurant called Fat Willy's...and it goes great with barbacue...its kinda expensive too...I still like the Chicago brew 312 better...|`|MS6IzOPLaa	I think it is most likely people longing for what they can't have.  I do enjoy Fat Tire and the other New Belgium brews (Skinny Dip Ale is just too good), but I'm sure all areas have beer that is just as good.  I haven't been back east in so long I don't know what micros they have, but I'm sure there are some equally comparable.|`|nrNrLuawaa	depending on the style they actually are pretty good... the brewery, New Belgium, makes quite a few choices

Then, if it is a s'mores poptart, I peel the middle parts in half and lick out the inside, starting with the marshmallow part. If it's strawberry, I eat the center in a counterclockwise circle.    God, I love poptarts.|`|47LJn3dzaa	I usually put mine in the toaster so then the frosting is crispy. I break off the crusts (my favorite part) and then eat them. I eat the rest while it is still nice and warm and the filling is gooey. (:|`|yXno8yIkaa	I don't eat them anymore, but when I did, I liked them toasted, then I'd bite it off.
zXavPbXfaa	Olive oil is a natural juice which preserves the taste, aroma, vitamins and properties of the olive fruit. Olive oil is the only vegetable oil that can be consumed as it is - freshly pressed from the fruit.     olive oil    The beneficial health effects of olive oil are due to both its high content of monounsaturated fatty acids and its high content of antioxidative substances. Studies have shown that olive oil offers protection against heart disease by controlling LDL ("bad") cholesterol levels while raising HDL (the "good" cholesterol) levels. (1-3) No other naturally produced oil has as large an amount of monounsaturated as olive oil -mainly oleic acid.|`|Q4oPyclQaa	Olive oil is not the only oil you can eat fresh.. there's flax seed oil which you don't heat or it destroys the nutritional qualities, and people use vegetable oil in tons of raw things, like mayonnaise, dressings, etc... I have no idea what that Pinky was trying to get at with that statement but they are wrong.|`|CZwJJetyaa	It raises HDL (the good cholesterol)  that prevents triglycerides (bad cholesterol)  from sticking to your arteries.
uauJyxJNaa	OLD SOUTH CHICKEN AND DUMPLINGS    Ingredients:  2-1/2 to 3 lb. Chicken (whole)  4 C Water  2 C Chicken broth   1 Carrot, roughly chopped   1 Medium onion, cut into quarters   1 Stalk of celery, roughly chopped   1/2 t Salt   1 C Milk   1/4 t Freshly ground pepper  .  Dumplings:  2 C All-purpose flour   1/2 t Baking soda   1/2 t Salt   3 T Shortening   3/4 C Buttermilk    Preparation:  Place the chicken in a Dutch oven, and add the water, broth, carrot, onion, celery and salt. Bring to a boil, cover and lower heat. Simmer for 60 to 70 minutes, or until tender and chicken is done. Remove chicken and allow it to cool enough to handle. Remove the carrot, onion and celery pieces from the broth and discard. Reserve the broth.   Bone the chicken, discarding all skin and bones, and cut meat into bite-size pieces. Set aside.     The Dumplings:   Combine the flour, baking soda and 1/2 teaspoon salt; cut in the shortening with a pastry blender or two knives until mixture is consistency of coarse meal. Add the buttermilk, stirring just until dry ingredients are moistened. Turn dough out onto a floured surface and knead 4 or 5 times -- no more.     For drop dumplings, pat the dough down to a 1/4-inch thickness, and pinch off 1-1/2-inch pieces.     For rolled dumplings, roll the dough to a 1/4-inch thickness, and cut into 3" x 1" strips.     Bring the chicken broth to a boil, and stir in the milk and pepper. Correct seasonings, if desired.     Drop dumplings, one or two at a time, into the boiling broth and reduce heat to medium-low. Stir from time to time to make sure dumplings do not stick together. Cook dumplings 8 to 10 minutes. Add the boned chicken to the mixture and simmer until heated through. Remove from heat. Makes 4 to 6 servings.     Notes: Dumpling dough is very similar to biscuit dough and, like biscuit dough, the less it is handled, the lighter and more tender the result.|`|XcNoptFbaa	Crock Pot Chicken and Dumplings    Slow Cooker Chicken and Dumplings  4 chicken breasts, boneless skinless  2 tablespoons butter, diced  2 cans cream of chicken soup  1 onion, diced  2 rolls biscuits (10 ounce rolls), torn into small pieces  Place chicken, butter, soup and onion in slow cooker, fill with enough water to cover.    Cover, cook on high for 4 - 5 hours. Remove chicken, allow to cool until able to handle. Shred into bite size pieces and return to slow cooker.    Add torn biscuits to mixture. Cover and allow to cook until dough is done, about 30 minutes  --------------------------------------...

Including what you catch yourself if you are like most of us. By the time you add up the cost of a fishing license, bait tackle and band aids it cost more than buying the fish.

afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	chicken noodle or tomato soup would be god, or french fries or potato chips, a pickle slice corn on the cob|`|Hjwp1yGWaa	All that is missing is a strarch, which requires some sort of potato, preferably fried, but could even be a potato chip side with a dill pickle on the side.  If you insist on a soup maybe a baked potato soup with cheese in it and potatoes(just an idea)|`|MYjAhq4Paa	A nice tomato soup would be excellent.   If not soup, then oven baked Lays Classic Potato Chips.  Good luck!|`|5a1a6abd8392c910af53b5981180c9ecaa	How about some good baked beans with sweet potato fries or:  mac and cheese and chips  simple cottage cheese with peaches or pineapple chunks  pickled beets and fries    clam chowder or tomato or even beefy vegetable soup would be my choices|`|AA10927032	I would have something with fruit. A Jello salad, perhaps lime with pears or raspberry with fruit cocktail, or orange Jello with mandarin oranges. Some lemon Jello, with grated carrots and crushed pineapple.   Some cottage cheese with a fruit would be nice.   Some potato soup, maybe loaded baked potato. Or tomato.|`|JlL68gfdaa	make your own wedges. cut  potatoes up in wedges and boil until semi cooked (not too soft cause you want them to finish cooking in the oven). while poatoes are still hot toss in some taco seasoning powder and olive oil to coat them. put in a hot oven until crispy. serve with some sour cream YUM! or if your lazy u can just buy some wedges or fries|`|APNB4OfIaa	The standard at my house is tomato soup or chowder.|`|iHFZLsDTaa	Nothing at all at our house.    But if you must have something, how about fried potatoes.  Or maybe potato chips.|`|sMLK4hDeaa	A good cream based soup.|`|AA10928232	Soup would be nice.  Maybe Potato, Broccoli-Cheddar, or French Onion.    Or a cold pasta salad or potato salad.    Baked Potato w/ toppings|`|8nIEuXplaa	I would go for a Oyster soup and sides of spicy fried chips with fried onions and sauted mushrooms|`|3VSZsXJ1aa	fries would be the logical answer for me, if you want to go fancy you can serve soup|`|flIpDJMzaa	I think a creamy tomato soup would go well.|`|1ZQyayiiaa	The BLT is all I would make. Ask if they would like something to drink with that sandwich.
SjDVMh3Uaa	Probably the taste. when I smoked I did not like lights because they had no flavor and did nothing for me. I liked a good strong cigarette. To me  a light was like inhaling plain air while the full flavor ones was like smoking. That is just me but like the other answers said ask her, but I bet it is because the lights don't have any flavor and are not strong enough.|`|xi9amEG2aa	I agree with the first answer....how are we supposed to know why your wife switch from one type of cigarette to another??  We aren't her.|`|DFXS4SB4aa	Isn't that a question you should be asking her?|`|PCsW0gbPaa	It's not really a taste, but more of a feeling.  I would describe Reds as "richer" feeling.  Sort of like the difference between skim milk and whole milk.      She is also probably taking a higher dose of nicotine.  If she's a regular smoker anyway, it probably doesn't matter.  But if she still only smokes when she goes out or something, then it would be a good time for her to stop before she becomes a hardcore addict.
hMygg8cnaa	yes    microwaving meats  can completely cook them  you know. :)|`|JlL68gfdaa	yeah thats fine. keep a close eye on them though cause they cook pretty fast and kinda do that exploding thing hotdogs do if u leave them for too long|`|61ddfb6410cdb1fde97533401cf0a601aa	just don't burn them.    They are juicier if you put them in a bowl of water...  and microwave them.|`|0ectWZxAaa	Yep, you can microwave it. I used to baby sit this kid who would eat hot dogs straight out of the package, cold. I thought it was gross but it is safe. Most meats that are precooked will tell you on the package as well.|`|AA11402528	yeah, you gotta like poke some holes in it thought cause it could explode|`|9CN0otoQaa	Yes, they're cooked, but they plump up and get hot in the micro.|`|pda0OoXZaa	suree|`|nT31zeQaaa	ya|`|SGh5R0rraa	yes, but make two small slices in them so they don't burst|`|vLZlPGEWaa	yeah, but wrap them in a paper towel or napkin first.
VdODek8Qaa	Facials  Pedicures  Manicures  Play secrets  truth or dare  Do each others make up, hair, etc.  make lip balm  would you rather  play pass the parcel, its fun and never gets old  Play "i never" with candy or like soda or juice.(or drink, if you do)  Do a scavenger hunt  Eat lots of snacks, and maybe make some  Watch "Chick Flicks" - probly not something you would like, but you will still have fun    hope this helps, but try not to plan too much, or you'll be disappointed when it doesn't go as you planned. Just relax and have fun|`|wUmJaLDcaa	If you are into fashion I suggest throwing a fashion and style themed party.  You could have all of the party guests bring their own plain white t-shirts to customize.  Some suggestions for decorations are fabric markers, pieces of patterned fabric, buttons, beads, iron on patches, and pretty much anything cool you can find.  Another great idea would be to set up a make your own jewelry station where guests can create their own piece of wearable art.  All you need is some necklace or bracelet chains, string, charms, beads, wire, and a little creativity.       Hope this helps and have a wonderful 14th birthday!|`|2MlziVG0aa	go in a limo,and drive around,get manies/pedies at the mall/watch a scary movie in theaters/ding dong ditch people haha :)) have funn happy b day :))
MS6IzOPLaa	Oh, they are sooo good!  I put mayo and some horseradish on my bread or bun and then meatloaf slices.  They are great warm or even at room temp (I love to pack them in my lunch!).|`|zn0pXkc0aa	I love meat loaf sandwiches.    I usually add ketchup and mustard on top of the meat loaf slice. Then sandwich with bread.    BBQ sauce would taste good too minus the ketchup and mustard.|`|UB7pWWHeaa	meatloaf+ bread  extra ketchup if you want  maybe a pickle  maybe lettuce if u want... it's up to you but the idea is pretty simple you have the meat and flavor there already, just add bread!|`|AA11193401	yes i just put ketchup on it|`|AA10824931	Mustard and Miracle Whip and chips on the side.  Good!|`|mG6Pu12Paa	I Love Meatloaf Sandwiches!  I usually just add ketchup and cheese or use my own homemade mayo mix for potato salad.

MS6IzOPLaa	Healthy, as in nutrients, they are not very good for you.  They do, however, have much fewer fat and calories than other chips.  I choose Baked over regular all the time in order to save on fat and calories (I also like baked better).|`|ILpp3ncYaa	Empty calories, but compared to other chips they are a great choice.|`|4XcmCKPbaa	they are not fried in fats and such. they are significantly better|`|M5Sw5SWfaa	Baked lays aren't fried in oil which means lower fat and calories than regular lays~|`|CmNTc1aSaa	they're still not healthy enough to be eaten regularly|`|IAhxPTXgaa	healtier than the friend ones.|`|R5xme92Naa	they aren't healthy at all, although they say it might be. it has 130 calories & 200mg sodium. which is a lot.|`|fNqYbxrBaa	regular potato chips are simmered in fatty oils and salt, but if baked, it reduces the fat and salt.
NEp2RpVBaa	When I hear the word cook I just think of someone who does basic cooking to a basic structure but when I hear chef I think of someone who is professional and puts his/her creative spin on things. I don't know if that's actually correct but those are the connotations I take from those two titles.|`|a6mHcrgEaa	chef gets paid more... head of the kitchen.  cook can be anyone.. like I cook dinner.. i am a cook lol|`|479182125f393fcf9723202d1fa6b1dbaa	The Chef is the boss of the kitchen, and the food.

I guess you can use line chef for a position but I think it is just kinda dresssing up the title|`|zXavPbXfaa	A chef has professional training from a culinary school....   a cook could be equally as good, just self-taught.|`|m9dJH32Taa	A chef is someone who has education behind them and actually knows how to cook. He has the knowledge and power to improve recipes.    A cook is someone who is not educated in cooking and who simply follows restaurant procedures as he is told.|`|htAuzn9faa	to become a chef, you need an education at a culinary school.  You can't carry the name of a chef its kind of like impersenating a doctor only not on that high of a degree.

Jo?l Robuchon is a chef.|`|Z4QbQt3Xaa	Chef is French for Chief; it means that you are in charge.  The lower position would be Sous Chef which means Under Chief.  It also implies that you've been to culinary school & have a diploma.  Misusing that title may annoy people in the trade.  Your sister is being a snob, seeking status.
x8m2KVJRaa	Both baking soda and baking powder are leavening agents, which means they are added to baked goods before cooking to produce carbon dioxide and cause them to 'rise'. Baking powder contains baking soda, but the two substances are used under different conditions.  When baking soda is combined with moisture and an acidic ingredient (e.g., yogurt, chocolate, buttermilk, honey), the resulting chemical reaction produces bubbles of carbon dioxide that expand under oven temperatures, causing baked goods to rise. You need to bake recipes which call for baking soda immediately, or else they will fall flat!    Baking powder contains sodium bicarbonate, but it includes the acidifying agent already (cream of tartar), and also a drying agent (usually starch). Baking powder is available as single-acting baking powder and as double-acting baking powder. Single-acting powders are activated by moisture, so you must bake recipes which include this product immediately after mixing.   Double-acting powders react in two phases and can stand for a while before baking. Some gas is released at room temperature when the powder is added, but the majority of the gas is released after the temperature of your product increases in the oven.|`|lTkYWiy5aa	Baking powder is baking soda + cream of tartar + cornstarch    http://chemistry.about.com/cs/foodchemis...|`|R9A8g6Dvaa	baking soda is what u put in pool water to clean a pool and baking powder is what u use to cook food

Trader Joes sells them. They are called "Coconut Date Rolls." They are just dates stuffed with an almond and rolled in coconut flakes. It's SUPER yummy, even better than eating a cookie in my opinion. And the best part is, it is also SUPER healthy for you! You get natural antioxidants and some vitamins and minerals from the date, healthy fats from the almonds, and some healthy lauric acid from the coconut.|`|hnjCNmRTaa	i havent done it on my own,but i eat almond-pitted-chocolate-covered dates as snacks all the time.its quite popular in the middle east.    and if you say so,yes it is very healthy :)
AA10824931	Condense milk is different than evaporated milk.  Which did you use?  If you use evaporated milk you may have problems.  If you used condensed milk then let it set and it will firm up.|`|EItWuP4Xaa	Yes, it will!|`|0t8Kzrvkaa	The recipe asks for Sweetened Condensed Milk, NOT Evaporated.  I'm assuming you're trying to make fudge with a Christmasy twist.  The sweetened condensed milk will be in a smaller can than the evaporated milk.  It will be white and syrup-like.  Evaporated is more like milk, but creamy colored.      I'm sorry, but you're going to have to start over if this is what you did.  And NO, it will be mushy and won't taste sweet enough.|`|lcg1u1U7aa	This recipe is actually a variation on ganache, even a small amount of extra liquid can affect the texture of a ganache, your candy will harden but it may be softer than you wanted it to be.

gKGROtYSaa	Eating chocolate increases the levels of endorphins released into the brain, giving credence to the claim that chocolate is a comfort food. The endorphins work to lessen pain and decrease stress. Another common neurotransmitter affected by chocolate is serotonin. Serotonin is known as an anti-depressant.

cZHsma8Jaa	If I am not mistaken, the peanut butter they recalled was the industrial size cans of peanut butter (like what restaurants get) and those crackers that have peanut butter in them.

8Wqbz6FMaa	Combination of soy sauce, oyster sauce, garlic, green onions, water, sesame oil and cornstarch (minced ginger and red pepper flakes optional).  Cut the meat you are using in thin strips, Cut the vegetables small and the same size.  Use high heat and wide cooking vessel like a wok.  Make sure your oil is very hot.  Cook the meat first, then add the vegetables.  Heat the vegetables thoroughly (about 2 minutes) before adding the sauce.  Keep turning for another 3 minutes.  Remove from wok right away and serve.  The whole cooking should not exceed 15 minutes.  I always stir-fry just before the meal so that the dish is fresh and piping hot when it is served on the table.|`|5ta5yyWSaa	Using high heat in a wok or very large deep skillet is key. I make the sauce with soy sauce, cornstarch and a little water mixed together at the end and just boil to thicken.  La Choy has a great teriyaki sauce in the little green labeled bottle which requires very little effort.    Cook the onions, meat and harder vegetables first. The snow peas and bean sprouts, water chestnuts take just a few minutes. Ken Hom has great recipes if you fall in love and want more...more ...more!|`|yfwY8XGlaa	with stir fry, the sky is pretty much the limit.  You really don't need a sauce.

You can look up stir fry recipes as a guideline, then make your own!|`|AA10928232	I generally use a bottled sauce like sweet & sour, "stir fry sauce", or even hoisin sauce if it goes w/ what I'm cooking.

Add vegetables in order of cooking time required:  sliced carrots, water chestnuts, broccoli, snow peas, bean sprouts, mushrooms, etc.  Put everything back in for a final heating & blending.

AA10928232	Usually the ratio for making cinnamon-sugar is 3 parts sugar to 1 part cinnamon.  So use 3 Tbsp sugar and 1 Tbsp cinnamon, or teaspoons even.    2 Tbsp of butter, melted, ought to cover a rectangle of dough about 12" x 9".  Brush melted butter on top, sprinkle w/ cinn-sugar, then roll up to make a 12" long roll.  Cut into slices. I like using dental floss -- slip under roll of dough, cross at top of roll, and pull.  Nice, neat slices.  Lay on greased pan, brush w/ a little more melted butter, and bake at 350o for 8-10 minutes.      These are also good if you spread cream cheese on the dough, then add the cinn-sugar and proceed as above.|`|uauJyxJNaa	It's left over dough.  I don't think there is an exact recipe for it.

As for the butter, I'm not sure as I don't know the surface area of the rolled dough.    My mother would roll out the left over dough and cut it into squares, about 3 inches large. She would put 2 tsp of sugar and about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon in the middle of each square and top with a small pat of butter. She then folded the corners of the dough into the center, sealed any openings and baked them until lightly browned. They were delicious.

7Ynmii5Taa	Ingredients  3 tablespoons amaretto   1 teaspoon ground cinnamon   2/3 cup heavy cream   1/3 cup confectioners' sugar   1/4 cup unsalted chopped pistachios   1 cup ricotta cheese   12 prepared cannoli shells   1/2 cup melted chocolate   ** I also like to add some mini chocolate chips sometime for an extra chocolate treat.    Directions  In a large bowl, whip together amaretto, cinnamon, heavy cream and confectioners' sugar until soft peaks form.     In a medium bowl, combine the pistachios and ricotta and stir in half of the whipped cream. Gently fold in the remaining whipped cream. Fill a pastry bag with no tip with the mixture to fill the cannoli shells.     Dip the tips of the cannoli into the melted chocolate. Place the sheet tray in the refrigerator for 2 hours or until filling and chocolate is set.       And here's a recipe for the cannoli shells if you need one:    Ingredients  1 1/3 cups flour   1 tablespoon shortening   1 pinch salt   1/2 teaspoon sugar   white wine (sweet or dry)   oil (for deep fat frying)     Directions  1. Mix together flour, shortening, salt and sugar.   2. Add enough wine to make a stiff but workable dough.   3. Roll dough into a ball and let it stand for about 1 hour.   4. Roll dough out 1/8 inch thick.   5. Cut rolled dough into 5x5 inch squares.   6. Place a cannoli tube across dough square on an angle (from top left corner to bottom right corner).   7. Wrap one corner around the tube, then the other (which should overlap the first).   8. Press together to seal seam.   9. Fry in deep fat, one at a time, until deep golden brown.   10. Carefully remove fried cannoli shell from tube.   11. Cool completely before filling.   12. Cannoli tubes are usually made from sheet aluminum and should be 8 inches long by 1 inch in diameter.

I have a friend who paid the money to go and she said it really wasn't worth it,  All they did was show her how to pour a bottle, where to set the glasses on the bar, and how to trick the customer into thinking he or she was getting more than a shot in their drink.

It was about $350 and they give you the basics of drinks and making drinks.    A lot of places require previous experience to get a bartender job. A lot of places would rather promote you from within (from server/busser/barback).    So is it worth it? All it does is gives you knowledge about making drinks. So when you know someone that can get you a bartender job, you can say "I know how to mix drinks".    I definitely think my investment was worth it.

XiT8q49Daa	the best way is to boil them so you're absolutely doing great. boil them with spices and you'll get the best chicken soup ever because the taste is really from the legs. you should put the lid on because it helps cook them faster. don't put it in the oven, you might burn them.    just relax, you're doing great. a natural in the kitchen perhaps. i was one a clueless person when it comes to cooking too but my mom said it'll come to us naturally.|`|bd7388851727f8e5810b81c40752ffb1aa	Poach the legs.  Bring water to a boil. Add your chicken legs. Cover. Then turn off fire. Don't raise lid.  Wait about 40 minutes. Lift lid and check if chicken is done by inserting a knife blade into the meat through to the bone.  If you see blood, then it's not done.    The poached chicken meat is more tender with more flavor than a boiled chicken.  I just eat my poached chicken by dipping it into soy sauce.|`|bGlZ8I2iaa	When it comes to a boil, turn the heat down and let it simmer for about 20 minutes or until done. You can make soup out of the broth in the pot and pull the meat off the bone and put some of it back in the soup and/or use it for other dishes like chicken sandwiches, chicken salad, enchiladas, chicken casserole, or what ever...|`|JlL68gfdaa	you should have put them in the oven so they went nice and crispy. next time put some olive oil and salt and pepper on the chicken. them on a tray and put into the oven at 200degrees C for about half an hour. when they are crispy take them out. tear one open with a fork to check they r cooked. if they r cooked drizzle over some sweet chilli sauce and EAT!|`|Z4QbQt3Xaa	Applying heat will cook anything; but they'll be very plain & dull.  You need to add some vegetables: carrots, onions, celery, etc.  The better alternative to the oven would be a frying pan.  Browning meat is what creates the flavour that we savour.  Once water boils, reduce to a simmer, the temperature stays high.  Watch the Food channel, search recipe sites, buy a cook book.

ewUQuX4Kaa	This is extremely complicated and costs a bunch of money.  You have to buy or lease a space to brew/distill, because you cannot own a license unless you have a place to produce it (unless you're contracting, but that's a whole other set of rules and stuff).  You then have to be licensed by your state, and the federal government as a manufacturer of liquor or a brewer or whatever - you have to meet strict guidelines to be granted a license, which is not free and has to be renewed at a fee once a year.  You also have to create a business identity (LLC, corporation, whatever you choose). This has to be done before you get a business license (which is different from a liquor license). Your business license also costs money and is subject to approval by your local municipality (city, township, whatever).  You also need a state tax and federal tax id.  You need a TON of insurance (especially if you're distilling, which is extremely dangerous unless you know what you're doing.)  Bear in mind, many states don't even allow micro-distilling...  After you do all this, purchase materials and create the liquid, then you have to invest in packaging. If you are going to sell off-site to retailers you need a label, which must be approved by the TTB division of the ATF dept.  Then you have to assign distributors to represent your brand, which is another EXTREMELY complicated explanation...  If you are a distiller, you'll most likely have to sell through the state, or by some method that's much more complicated than selling wine or beer...    Long story short, it's a serious commitment, and you'll need financial backers and a good lawyer.    EDIT...  Not sure if I completely understand, but I'll go for it.  You cannot sell something with instructions for people to distill it themselves, as home-distillation is illegal in the US and almost every other country.  If you are creating the product outside of the US, you still need the product to be registered to be sold in the US through the TTB, ATF, and the FTC.  It must be a distilled product, if you are refering to it as liquor, since an alcoholic spirit is a distilled product.  Even if you do manufacture it in another country, you'll need to set up with an importer of alcohol, as well as a series of distributors, not to mention get approval from every state you plan on selling it in.  Not to discourage you in any way, but it's a serious commitment...|`|h6NqNzHAaa	I used to work for a winery and finding all the information you need can be daunting.  You won't be able to distribute it yourself, you must go through a distributor (you can sell it from the plant for personal use, not to a store). Start with your local officials, some towns won't allow liquor manufacturing within town limits. Work up from there.|`|AA11615501	First you must brand, label and find a way to identify your product as yours. Then you must find a patent on the aformentioned. Then you must identify your audience and sell your product in a forum.  It takes more than just having a brand and good product. After this, I must insist on a retainer for my lucid and intelligent advice....
lrqZHi9Jaa	Very light soy sauce, brown sugar, lemongrass and a little ginger is wonderful as is just a basic garlic and lemonjuice marinade.  Very simple and fresh.  If using a whole chicken try stuffing with the lemons rather than discarding after squeezing them.  Adds extra flavour to the chicken.  I love using a bit of coriander to serve it with.    Another recipe you could try is Jamie Olivers chicken breast in a bag.     Ingredients:  2 chicken breasts skinless and scored                     1 egg beaten with 2 tablespoons water                      1 handful dried porcini                     9oz (225gm) mixed mushrooms (field, oyster,shiitake)                     torn up                     1 large wineglass white wine                     2 med.potatoes peeled sliced and cooked                     3 tablespoons butter                     2 cloves garlic peeled and sliced                     olive oil                     sea salt and pepper    Preheat oven to 425 (220f).  Mix mushrooms, wine, potatoes, butter, thyme, garlic, olive oil and salt and pepper together in a bowl and then add chicken breasts.    using wide aluminium foil make a bag by folding 1 large (3 feet piece) in half. Brush all edges with eggwash and fold foil in half again creating a double thick bag with a closed end.  Fold the side edges over twide creating 2 sealed edges and one side open. Put the mixture into the pouch plus liquid and seal up the opening.  try to make sure you dont pierce the bag anywhere.  Once tightly secured put onto a roasting tray. Put tray on high heat of burner 1 minute just to get it going and then bake in middle of oven for 30 minutes. Remove from oven, put bag on big platter and serve direct from foil.

civJQaEkaa	This used to happen in my family alot. my mom would cook dinner for all of us a couple hours before my dad got home from work. she would make him a plate, cover it in the cling wrap and put it in the fridge. than in about 2 hours my dad would come home, stick it in the microwave and heat it up. this is the best way to do it, believe me. if you keep it in the oven on a low temp the food might dry out. if you leave it out it will become infested with germs and bacteria. keeping it in the fridge minimizes both these things and keeps the food fresher.|`|zXavPbXfaa	assuming there's nothing in there that will spoil over the span of a few hours, I'd just seal it tightly with Saran wrap and leave it out on the stove or in the microwave (turned off, of course) until he gets home.    I agree, after it's been in the fridge or left on the stove cooking that long it just doesn't taste quite as good.|`|qRCZRdqOaa	well if its in the oven you can just not cook whatever your making for the husband all the way but keep your dinner in and after you finish cooking your dinner put his in and finish cooking mostly all the way then leave it in the oven because all the warmth in the oven will keep it warm and finish cooking it completely.    if its on the stove DO NOT SARAN WRAP IT trust me all the hot air escapes its the WORST thing to do you should just cook it in a metal stove pot and cover it with the metal lid because the metal keeps the warmth in NOT PLASTIC SARAN WRAP because it bounces of the metal instead of escaping throught the saran wrap.|`|IAhxPTXgaa	it's only 3 hours, if the food is fresh you can leave it out.

wjEPVNezaa	Drink enough water, and eat more.  Eating twice a day is not healthy if you're pretty active.  If you're worried about calories, eat less per meal but eat more meals.  Scratch that, just eat more.    And I dunno if it helps or not, but I'm Indian, and I find it impossible to be healthy unless I eat Indian food.  When I was in college and away from home, I ate American meals in the dorm, and even though I tried very hard to be healthy/balanced, if I didn't eat a "full meal," then I would get symptoms like yours.  I honestly don't know how to be veg without Indian food.    So, I'd recommend for a couple days of the week, go to an Indian restaurant and eat "daal, bhaat, roti, shaak."|`|9ilXVowLaa	you need more variety,more vitamins and iron.  rice and beans every day?  you need soy and protein.  even if all you want is fruits and veggies,go for a wide variety of colors.  the darker the color the better for your health.  also consider a multi vitamin.|`|ZhiYghZ1aa	you need to eat more, and more of a variety. there can be no way your getting in all your nutrients. your losing weight rapidly because you aren't eating much.  if you feel like you still need to lose weight, slow it down and just lose a couple pounds a week. eat atleast 1200 calories a day at the very very lowest, but since your active you should be really eating more than that.  your mom should not have to make you eat, you need to talk to someone if you are feeling like you need to skip meals.
c9adce326b761303adb12127ff5dabd0aa	Use a thermometer. I know most people don't have one. That's why they ruin meat. 350 until it reaches 165 deg in the center.|`|mzk0t6Ovaa	First off, you "roast" pork versus baking it. . .     If you're looking at pulled pork (barbecue style), your best bet is  the old low and slow. . . A 250F-300F oven, a covered roasting pan  or dutch oven, and 5-8 hours of slow cooking.  Try building a spice  rub of paprika, salt, brown sugar, garlic powder, and whatever other  spices herbs you like (I use celery seed, ground chipotles, etc.).  Just be sure to add some braising liquid to your roaster and keep it  covered.    Now, if you're talking about a pork loin or regular pork roast, that  whole 165F cooking temp is a good rule of thumb.  The one thing that  most people will forget to tell you (or don't know) is that you want to  pull the roast/loin before it hits that number.  If you have a meat  thermometer, pull your roast/loin out of the oven at around 150F-155F  at the most.  Even after you pull the meat from the oven, you'll have  temperature increases and carryover cooking.  If you pull your pork  at 165F, it's going to run up to 175 or 180 and be dry (unless you're  hip to brining).  Finish temp of 160-165F - good.  Coming out of the  oven at the temp - bad.|`|HXadRqVfaa	a good rule of thumb for any meat is 30 minutes per pound at 350 degrees.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	at least 325 degrees, cook it until you can insert a fork into white meat and clear juices apprear

0fuF2sHbaa	I did it cold turkey from being a meat eater.    What really helped me was being able to cook. It's really simple if you have all the basic cooking ingredients (olive oil, spices, frozen or potted herbs, vinegars etc) and can Google vegan recipes.     Like if you want something with rice, google 'vegan rice', or if you want a cookie, google 'easy vegan cookies' etc.    If you're not really into cooking, look up some simple recipes and build up the basics slowly, so you don't have to run to the shops whenever you want something to eat.    Remember your reasons for wanting to be vegan, and spend some time thinking them over. Chances are they'll be enough to make you throw the eggs and cheese out.    My tips would be     1. Get some B12 vitamin, you need 3mg a day. I have 12mg tablets which I take daily, but you can get up to 3000mg to take every once in a while because your body stores B12 for up to 5 years.    2. Stock up on nice vegan food, and find out which of your favorite foods don't contain animal bits. (Vegan food is just normal food without all the weird flesh and cow juice)    3. Look around a health food store, bring home ingredients that you can keep for for cooking and healthy snacks.     4. Whatever your reason for being vegan is, do more about it. If you're doing it for the animals, see what animal aid charities you can support. If it's for the environment, find out about living as eco-friendly as possible. For your health? Find out about nutrition and buy some health food cookbooks.     Good luck and congrats :)|`|ZhiYghZ1aa	a lot people say it is easier to go gradually for me it was easier to go cold turkey, because then it is like black and white when it comes to determining if something is okay to eat or not.    my advice would be to indulge, don't think your giving up things cause honestly for about every non vegan food there is a vegan version. i'd just stock up on the vegan version of things.   if you live near a health food store that would probably make the switch a lot easier, i live in a small town and it is such a hassle having to overload on foods whenever i finally make it to a health food store.  maybe invest in a nice fun vegan cookbook like vegan with a vengeance, make the switch fun.    watch out for honey, it is in so many breads. also beeswax is in many lotions, shampoos, & chapsticks.|`|4XcmCKPbaa	i think it will be dificult, but im sure you can do it|`|mRvZq0VZaa	I don"t understand what the road block thing is about.  You chose to be vegan or you don't.  You make it sound like its some sort of noble, lofty goal your trying to achieve, but nobody cares whether or not you're a vegan.  Its a personal choice.  Either make the commitment or forget about it.|`|4pco9j9Faa	I spent two weeks thinking abut how hard it was going to be to go vegan, and two minutes missing my chocolate. It got easier from there.

I would say the best thing to do is get all the replacements you can in the beginning so if you crave something you can have the vegan version of it and not fail by eating the non-vegan thing!

But you need to find if your body is accompanying your desire or thought. Keep your goal in mind and go on reducing eggs, cheese or milk slowly for the body becomes accustomed. You will have some "desires" that shows that your body is looking for something, but for not suffer you can give limited little portions of the "old meals" and you keep watching the reactions in the body. Sometimes you will be anxious or nervous, that you can treat with herbs (chamomile tea, passion flour, etc.) or hunger, just after the meal. Sometimes a bit of sugar makes the problems passes by, sometimes salt or just water.   Watch closely the vitamins, especially the "B" complex.  Good Luck!

7igxiGrAaa	Alcoholism is not whether you are addicted to alcohol or not. Addiction is possible but not the only signs.   The difference between social drinking and alcohol abuse is when alcohol becomes your focus. You might only want to attend social events that involve alcohol, or you cant enjoy yourself. Getting to the bar, or making a drink after coming home from work becomes more important than connecting with friends or family. Alcohol might be your way to avoid painful feelings or troubled relationships. And you might resort to dangerous behavior, like driving while drunk or even increased violent behavior. Increased dependence on alcohol leads to alcoholism, where you are physically dependant on alcohol and have lost control of the amount you drink.    Alcohol abusers, or problem drinkers, are people who drink too much on a regular basis. The alcohol use is self-destructive or can present a danger to others, but they still demonstrate some ability to set limits and establish some measure of control over their drinking. While some people are able to maintain this pattern for a long amount of time, alcohol abusers are at risk for progressing to alcoholism. This might happen in response to a large stressful event, such as retirement or losing a job. Or it might gradually progress as tolerance to alcohol increases.     When alcohol abuse progresses to alcoholism, also called alcohol addiction or alcohol dependence, alcohol becomes essential to function. Alcoholic symptoms include a physical dependence on alcohol, and inability to stop despite severe physical and psychological consequences. Some alcoholics can hold down a job or appear to be functioning on the surface, but the drinking inevitably leads to impaired job performance and troubled relationships.    The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism provides a screening questionnaire for assessing the differences between alcohol abuse and alcoholic dependence.  Remember, though, the bottom line is how alcohol affects you. If it is affecting your relationships, job, or health, yet you cant seem to stop yourself, than the problem is serious.|`|J3fFR3Wuaa	alcoholics never turn down a drink!|`|hU0Wu98kaa	if it interferes w your daily life style, then yes.  and btw i would give up alcohol.  its the cause of many devastiating accidents|`|6jkusbCgaa	No one can tell you that you are an alcoholic except for yourself. When you are willing to admit that you are powerless over alcohol and that your life has become unmanageable, you will have taken the first step to realizing that you are an alcoholic.|`|170echM9aa	Yes it is a definite sign that your drinking patterns are harmful and considered alcohol dependent or alcoholic.|`|xi9amEG2aa	I love drinking too.  But I don't drink to get drunk.  If you do, you probably are an alcoholic.  If you're out with friends and just happen to get drunk...then no, you're just having fun.

You know you're an alcoholic when drinking degrades the quality of your life.  It doesn't sound like that's the case for you.    Besides, if you're in college you have a little more wiggle room to mess around with it.  And an easy measuring stick... are your grades still good?  If they are, then you are most likely ok.|`|K8a3a6PNaa	You sound like any other person who likes having fun. Who doesn't want to drink on stressful days? Just don't make a routine out of it or else you'll be on your way to becoming an alcoholic. If you use it like all the time whenever your stressed out you'll start relying on it a lot more and eventually it'll turn into a daily habit and then my friend you'll start up a long dark road through alcoholism. Stay away from that road! If you still have the ability to say no, then take advantage of it and limit your drinking to no more than once a week since i understand you are in college.& are looking for some fun. For my friend, once you become an alcoholic, you'll lose the ability to say no because you won't be in control anymore since you're body will become so dependent on it. One of the ways you can detect an alcoholic is when they start having with drawl symptoms. This means going without alcohol for a few hours would lead to shaking, sweats, hallucinations, pain, and in the most severe addicts.. death.|`|8tYTSN3Kaa	no|`|xKcphGWIaa	u might be =/|`|qXlBsRLgaa	no if you can control it its not a problem|`|yfwSDroNaa	your not but just learn to not drink when your stressed out...try to manage that better|`|NEpZfhVGaa	Better to be safe then sorry.|`|IpXsPG8qaa	Nope, you just like to have fun like any typical college student.

Drinking is affecting your work (I don't mean the occasional hangover, I mean like once a month or more you're coming in to the job hungover, or still drunk from the previous night.) Even worse if you seriously consider drinking while at work.    2. Drinking is affecting your home life. For example, you're getting into more fights with friends / girlfriends / family because either you're drunk, or because they are concerned about how much you're drinking. If you choose drinking over friends and family, that's a problem.    3. Drinking is affecting your health. Again, not just a simple hangover here. I mean you've been drinking so constantly that your skin is starting to look bad, your eyes are always bloodshot, etc.|`|9cpKYneZaa	Booze can fool you. Just because you think you can turn down a drink, doesn't mean you won't at a critical moment.    Its one thing to drink socially, once in a while and enjoy 1 or 2 glasses of wine, beer or your favorite hard liquor. But when you get past a few shots or 2 or 3 glasses, and then don't stop till you're toasted or sloshed, then you're a lush.    Best practice: if you have to ask, you're probably a drunk.     So stop drinking already. Its no longer an occasional thing now. Its something you're obsessing over and that means you're a drinker.|`|n5JVpVuDaa	I think you're a budding alcoholic unless you can "grow up" and stop binging after you graduate.  Many who get drunk at college parties go on to be binge drinkers or full time drinkers.  Both are considered alcoholics.  The fact that you can say "no" to a party now, means nothing in in 15 years.  By that time you may find you don't need a party to get you into drinking.  I was told once that if you have to ask the question, you are an alcoholic.

eeRLckg5aa	This a sweet/sour potato salad (served hot or cold), that has been in my family for generations. It is my favorite for sure(:    German Potato Salad  Ingredients  15 small potatoes   2 cups water   1 cup vinegar   1 cup sugar   2 teaspoons salt   4 tablespoons butter   1 onion   12 slices bacon   1/4 cup cornstarch   salt and pepper     Directions  Boil potatoes 10-15 minutes. Drain while making sauce.   Fry bacon until crisp, drain and crumble. Set aside.   Fry onion until slightly done in bacon grease.   Add water, vinegar, sugar and salt. Bring to a boil, turn down heat and add 1/4 cup cornstarch dissolved in a small amount of water.(this will thicken the sauce -- a must!).   Add the butter and stir until melted.   Peel and slice warm potatoes and add to sauce.   Stir in bacon. Salt and pepper to taste.|`|hKlsJgVSaa	I have 2. The first one is more of an eye ball recipe, the second is a recipe I follow.

vtixxvU0aa	I know that on ebay the have sandals with hidden flasks, as well as flask cellphones lol. But when it comes to your room, hmmmm you could try putting it in a plastic pouch, like capri sun for instance and slipping it under your mattress, hmmmmm no thats not good enough, or maybe, you can fill up a pringles can with it and put it on display with a "piggy bank" note on it. Hmmmmmm, no, something better?.........AHA! take some siccors, or a knife, and find a unused corner of your room, cut the corners carpet so the carpet can flap up/down and place a zip-loc baggie of booze underneath, finally, place a teddy bear on top of where the baggie is hidden ;)|`|qMdRIdiqaa	well not that i have ever do this but you could always go to the hard ware store and buy a safe that is made to look like an electrical outlet or get a key ring that has a small screwdriver (make sure it is both flat and phelps head) then you could always use any vent anywhere you are. I sure hope you are old enough to be drinking!|`|PCsW0gbPaa	In my belly.    Or else in the tank of the toilet.

But, why do you want to hide your booze? When I was younger (too young) my friends and I used to put vodka in water bottles. It worked until my mom smelled it and then I was in trouble! Lesson: If you're hiding alcohol you are either too young or have a problem.|`|b37f2b23a440d20ba2b99b465d00d138aa	rubber boots|`|Tj6EhqRpaa	If there really little bottles hide them in the phone line holes in the wall theirs just one little wire but a hole.. great place if the bottle will fit..|`|ltkBtUiTaa	if you have a dresser with sliding drawers take out the bottom one put the stuff on the floor inside and replace the drawers

SjDVMh3Uaa	I started smoking cigarettes when I was 14 in 1966 because all my friends smoked and I wanted to fit in. 7 years later I was a 2 an a half to three pack a day smoker and quit cold turkey. Then 15 years later I started smoking again due to a divorce and 2 years later I quit again and have not gone back.|`|xi9amEG2aa	Smoking has to be one of the most DISGUSTING habits.  You smell like smoke, even when you're not smoking, your clothes smell, your house smells...everything smells like cigarette smoke.  I've been around smokers all my life, and I hate it.  Even though I am in a smokey environment (I'm a welder), I still hate it.  My lungs are probably nasty enough from being around second hand smoke for 20 years + being a welder for 2.  I dislike people who smoke, especially the rude people out in public who just HAVE to blow the smoke in your general direction...especially standing in some sort of a line.|`|AA12064771	NOTHING.    Because I like to breathe and have my lungs the real color they're suppose to be!|`|2FVwbIe5aa	weedd :)  haha just kidding, but i have tried it.  i've also tried cigarettes.  but it was basically just seeing what it's like.  i HATE ciggs, never gonna take up the habit, too many bad things that come with it.  and with weed, i might do it every now and then when i'm out partying.  haha|`|nI6dyZCNaa	well, it all started in 6th grade...yeah    and, i haven't stopped.    i started because i like it, and i haven't stopped because i love it.    and i don't care that its illegal!    but im trying to quit cigarettes because they are ruining my marijuana inhalation units.|`|AA11835801	Nothin' like blazing before sex to shake things up in the bedroom!!|`|m9dJH32Taa	Tried some when I was young.    Haven't smoked any in 15 years.|`|6CYbn89Haa	NONE!!!!!!!!!!  those shits are just waist of time and of your life    DONT EVER DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ZS7Ew7F3aa	No, not technically, but the term vegetarian can be use to describe part of a diet also...like ovo-lacto (eggs-dairy) vegetarian or pescatarian (eats fish, too), poultratarian (poultry, too) or any mix-match of those terms.   However, those people may also use the term Flexitarian to self-explain all that. I do!   But a strict vegetarian typically doesn't eat any animal products or by-products.  Vegans (& many vegetarians) will NOT consume, use, purchase, etc,  ANYTHING made from animals or that contain ANY animal products/by-products or are tested on animals.    & btw, contrary to another poster's comment, the term 'vegetarian' doesn't mean you ONLY eat veggies! It includes fruits, nuts, seeds, beans & SO much more, just as long as it doesn't come from animals...that's the key.|`|zJi5Cjpiaa	isn't it obvious? That was a waste of your 5 points.|`|ZhiYghZ1aa	no.|`|XMFdD8vIaa	No. Vegetarians aren't suppose to eat meat.|`|uSqc6bUuaa	no|`|7xkwE3X9aa	NO!|`|lm0nlP04aa	No, that is why they are called vegetarians, they only eat vegetables.|`|H1aSslbiaa	no, because some people just don't like killing animal.  they think it's unmanly and evil to animal. so they just don't eat meat, just vegetables.|`|184225fa17153da728f76dfde4079144aa	umm...............            no.
llkSmgLJaa	Do you mean wheat gluten, or seitan? In a large mixing bowl you add water to whole wheat flour. Nead it, into a ball, like your making bread. Now nead it under a stream of cold water. The mixing bowl should be in the sink under the stream of water.  Keep doing this for about 30 minutes. What is left is raw seitan (wheat protein).
PhPOLgHGaa	all it is--is the fact that your carbonated drink froze then thawed, therefor losing its carbonation, it went flat....you tasted more of the sugars and syrups that are used to make the drink. there is nothing wrong with it--it will not harm you in anyway....the only thing is that it will not have fizz an carbonation....the taste is just altered because of it. it is flat...    i had this happen with a bottle of diet coke ....    unfortunatly no ones fault but our own for having left it in the car during such cold weather.    regardless of how good it is for you, you deserve to treat yourself to soemthing you like....|`|XHnpraaxaa	The carbonation is gone so it is flat. Not good for you either way so best to ditch it and find something better to drink like water or a real juice.|`|wdvUNvz6aa	well it could be that plastic causes cancer and when you freezr it and thaw it out there were more cancerous substances in it?|`|WcFCOkIQaa	First of all, they're probably some particles in it, and the ice that makes it taste bad, you shouldn't have drank it!
