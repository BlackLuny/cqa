20090307170833AAfZU2Q	Science & Mathematics;Chemistry	How do i calculate the number of grams in Gas Law Equations?	A piece of sodium metal reacts completely with water as follows.   2 Na(s) + 2 H2O(l) 2 NaOH(aq) + H2(g)   The hydrogen gas generated is collected over water at 25.0°C. The volume of the gas is 180 mL measured at 1.00 atm. Calculate the number of grams of sodium used in the reaction. (Vapor pressure of water at 25°C = 0.0313 atm.)

If someone could please explain how to do this problem I would appreciate it (I don't necessarily need someone to give me the answer, I would prefer a set of steps or instructions on how to figure it out because I am really stumped).       Three student chemists measured 50.0 mL of 1.00 M NaOH in separate calorimeters. Andrew added 50.0 mL of 1.10 M HCl to his solution of NaOH; Lyndsay added 45.5 mL of 1.10 M HCl (equal moles) to her NaOH solution. Dale added 50.0 mL of 1.00 M HCl to his NaOH solution. Each student recorded the temperature change and calculated the enthalpy of neutralization. Two of the chemists will report, within experimental error, the same temperature change for the HCl/NaOH reaction. Identify the two students and explain.

20090307220427AArXBR5	Science & Mathematics;Biology	If a limited gene pool results in genetic erosion over several generations, what would billions of years do to?	our genes?      You keep breeding pure breed animals, you eventually get animals with shared genetic disorders and diseases often appearing later in life due to a limited gene pool. Certain ethnic and religious groups have specific diseases due to their practice of breeding within the small genetic confines of their "tribe." That's GENETIC EROSION on a MICRO scale.      If life has existed on earth for billions of years and human beings, for millions of years, why did we not see genetic erosion on a MACRO scale but the opposite? We supposedly went through a process of GENETIC COMPLEXITY by means of "evolution" over time, despite our limited gene pool.       Does this make sense? It it supposed to make sense? I'm asking here in this section hoping to get a more educated response.

20090307221407AAeZEke	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	Can someone help me with this Electric Circuit Problem?	1.) Design each of the circuits specified in the Procedure section of this lab. Your design should attempt to get within   § 5 % of the specified gain. All designs are to use standard commercial 5 % resistors. You may only use a single   resistor for each calculated value.   2.) Your designs must include bias compensation. This means that the resistance to ground (with all sources dead)   must be approximately the same at the ? and + input terminals. (When all sources are dead, both the input and the   output appear to be grounded.)      Procedure   The op-amp chip that you will be using, the LM747, comes in a 14-pin DIP PACKAGE, which stands for dual in-line   pin package. The two rows of seven pins are arranged with 0.1 inches between pins and 0.3 inches between rows. The   pin-out diagram is shown in Figure 1. This diagram illustrates the top view of the chip. The end of the chip with the   #1 pin is identified by both the notch and the dot.   The LM747 requires a dual power supply in most applications. A positive voltage with respect to ground is supplied   to the V+ pins and a negative voltage with respect to ground to the single V? pin. The power supply ground, by itself,      Please click here to view Figure 1       http://img13.imageshack.us/my.php?image=...       Please click here to view Figure 2       http://img17.imageshack.us/my.php?image=...       is not needed by the chip. It will be used, however, as a reference for your signals. The proper power connections are   illustrated in Figure 2.   When you test each of your designs, measure the gain using a DC input voltage. Be careful that the output of the   op-amp is not being saturated. You can check this by cutting the input by a factor of, say, two, and verifying that the   output is reduced by the same factor. If the relationship does not hold, you are saturating the output by applying too   strong of an input signal to the amplifier. Use the white breadboards to build your circuits.   Secondly, test the gain of each circuit using a 1 kHz, AC signal. Again, watch for saturation, but this time increase the   input until the output obviously saturates. Then reduce the input enough to have a “clean” output.   1.) Inverter — Design, build, and test an inverter that has a gain of -15 and an input resistance of at least 1 kW.   Orderliness of your wiring is important. If you are not careful, you will have a non-working circuit or even a dead   op-amp. The chips are easy to burn out via electro-static discharge, and do not do anything spectacular when they go   (such as smoke).   2.) Non-inverter—Design, build, and test a non-inverting circuit with a gain of 15 and an input resistance of at least   1 kW.   3.) Summer — Design, build, and test a summing amplifier that produces an output of Input1+2 ￠ Input2. The input   resistance of each input should be at least 2 kW.   4.) Cascaded Amplifier—Design, build, and test a non-inverting amplifier with a gain of 25 and an input resistance   of at least 50 kW. Do this without using any outlandish resistors. (For example, try cascading two op-amps together,   each with a smaller gain.)

It is the weekend and no dentists are available)      Since I do not have access to any synthesized products    which induce vasoconstriction I am short of options.  All I could come up with was caffeine to act as a vasoconstrictor.      My question: Does anyone know of anything besides caffeine which may aide in this process to increase the duration benzocaine?      Thanks.

20090307224437AATxfXk	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	Ok people, you wanted the question and I will ask?	I am not an intellectual snob, I do respect many of the YA answerers, and I am quite capable of putting questions into words people can understand.  I was looking for answers to questions above what I have seen here but since I got all the negative feedback I will ask.      1.  What is the fabric of space?  Regarding gravity, General Relativity is the theory that mass creates a dent in the fabric of space proportional to the amount of mass.  What is being dented?  I also wonder about electromagnetic waves and what the medium the waves are acting in (again the fabric of space according to current research). I asked 2 physicists and one cosmologist.  None had a real answer other than it fits the math.   2.  If General Relativity is correct then gravity is the distortion of the fabric of space.  How does that correlate with the search for gravitons and Grand Unification Theories?  The same physicists and cosmologist did not have any answers.   3.  If they would find gravitons would that negate the General Relativity Theory?  If so is there another theory that could take its place and still allow for gravitons?  One of the physicists postulated that parts of M Theory may be able to satisfy General Relativity and gravitons, however my research cannot find any real correlation (not that I am totally understanding of M Theory).  The cosmologist says that General relativity can coexist with gravitons but it will take some modification regarding explanations currently used.

20070418112747AAjzwj6	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Help please!!!!!!!?	Learning Goal: To understand how to use conservation of angular momentum to solve problems involving collisions of rotating bodies.         Consider a turntable to be a circular disk of moment of inertia It rotating at a constant angular velocity Wi around an axis through the center and perpendicular to the plane of the disk (the disk's "primary axis of symmetry"). The axis of the disk is vertical and the disk is supported by frictionless bearings. The motor of the turntable is off, so there is no external torque being applied to the axis.   Another disk (a record) is dropped onto the first such that it lands coaxially (the axes coincide). The moment of inertia of the record is Wr. The initial angular velocity of the second disk is zero.      There is friction between the two disks.      After this "rotational collision," the disks will eventually rotate    with the same angular velocity.      What is the final angular velocity, Wf, of the two disks?   Express  Wf in terms of It, Ir, and Wi .

I get the whole: "f is continuous at c if c is in the domain of f so that f(c) equals a number."  What I don't understand, however, is how you get "c."  This is what I mean:      The problem is given the directions "Find the numbers at which f is continuous.  At which numbers is f discontinuous?"      For problems such as:      f(x) = 2x + 3      does that mean essentially that any number in the domain of f(x) (which is all real numbers for this case), will equal       lim f(x) = f(c)   x--> c      ?      HOWEVER, for something like, say, f(x) = 4 sin x, how can you conclude that every number in the domain of f(x) will equal   lim f(x) = f(c)   x--> c      ?      Does it take into account the period properties of the trigonometric functions???  HELP PLEASE!
