20080313164259AAayf8z	Social Science;Psychology	Follow My Passion or Make Money?	I'm trying to get an idea of where I wanna go in life, cuz I feel like I have no real goals to acheive with no set plan. My passions are music and photography, but I'd only consider photojournalism as a career. I'm also very interested in Psychology and I'd love to spend my life helping people. I also love traveling.   So should I follow a career that pays well (psychologist) so I have the money to have a family and nice things and go cool places and do my passions on the side?    OR should I be a photographer/photojournalist, and travel around a lot and be busy and not have that much money, but a really cool job?   HELP!

20090131090358AA3SrKJ	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Do feminists really feel that most men could even desire to have a woman 'take care' of them?	I've been on a couple of dates recently, wherein, during the 1st couple of dates, she asked whether I, deep down, want a woman to cook and clean for her. I see this same sentiment on this forum a lot. I would guess that only about 30% of men would even want this, and that about 10% of men could actually carry out such an expectation, in 1st world countries, at least. What men (even players, eventually) really want, is for a woman to be kind, to be their friend, and to have physical intimacy with them. The phrase 'the devil's in the details' is appropriate here. The only truly reliable area where men expect something unfair that utilizes the term 'take care of' is young children.    Thoughts?

20090131090101AAjOqbk	Social Science;Psychology	What can I do, feeling suicidal?	My life sux. I really think I'm depressed. My step dad makes jokes about me being ddepressed.      Last year, a week before (well really 2 years ago, it was in 2007) school got out for Christmas break, this kid was messing with me. He is much bigger than me. He wanted to copy my science work. I refused. He stole my things, and I attacked him. He gave my things back, I did 2 more problems, he repeated it. I attacked again. At lunch he reported me for physically attacking him. His arm was bleeding ( I used my pencil, the only thing I really had other than fists, I don't like just punching though).       He got a paddling, and went back to lunch. I got suspended for a week. My mom was pregnant and blamed everything on me. It was miserable. I looked forward to going to school, church, and other out of the house activities, just to get away from it.      when I got home, she was screaming at me telling me how as soon as my step dad gets home she's going to kill me, or at least make my life a living hell. I couldn't handle this. It was a friday, and I would have 1 day of school, before a 2 1/2 week break.       I ran away. My friend lived 3 houses down (she still does), and I went in and told her. She asked her mom if I could run away and live with them.      She agreed. They made me call my dad. He lives several states away.      He set up a day to have me flown out, but I would have to go back to my mom's house.      My aunt went to my friends house and took me to my mom's house.      She seemed really upset, and like she might care. I told her I didn't want to go back, that ANYTHING was better. She disagreed and said my mom was a nice person. I asked her if we were talking about the same person. I told her what happend at school, and how everytime I tried to tell her, she would interupt, and say "There is NO excuse for you to start violence." "If you think violence is an okay solution, I'll SHOW you how violence works."      She told me she was better. I finally went back.      I told the cops answers to their questions. They were stupid questions too like "What color is your hair?" "Your eyes?" "How tall are you?"      Like they can't SEE me.      Well, she talked about putting me in the womens shelter a few blocks from my school. I told her "Go ahead, being dead would be better than here. I HATE it here. The only reason you called the f*cking cops was to make my life WORSE. I hate you, and wish you would."   she said stuff about a suicide threat, and putting me in a loony bin before she breaks my "bratty little head".   Again I told her to go ahead, as long as I don't have to stay. Stealling a line from Princess Bride (to a degree) I said "If I don't have a NEW home by morning you will find your daughter dead. There suicide threat, get me OUT of here."      She got pissed at me.      My dad called her and requested custody for the rest of the school year. After 1 1/2 hours of argueing she agreed.      My flight was in 8 days. I had every chore in the house until the 7th night. I didn't care. I went to school one day, then it was Christmas break. The next day was my flight. At school I told everybody "YES! I'm getting the hell away from all you stupid bitches!" They thought I was JOKING.      I lived with him for the agreed time. My grades were ALL failing because of the school I missed, and I couldn't get any of my assignments turned in.      My highest grade was a 47. Before I got suspended my LOWEST grade was an 84. I'm usually strait A student, maybe a B or 2. I once had a C.      Well becuase of that, my average in Wyoming was REALLY low. My lowest grade was like a 68.      I was happy though. I asked to stay forever. I hadn't been happy since they got divorced. Even though before that, he was always gone, the thought of seeing him only 7 weeks a year was really depressing. Mom allowed me to stay 2 1/2 months inthe summer though, and 1 1/2 weeks of Christmas, or a combination of Thanksgiving and Spring Break. Alternating every other year.      I was happy, I slowly made friends. I strated popular, then everyone hated me, then after a month or 2, I had like 4 friends.         He was taking her to court for custody. She used the grades against him, and they never actually went to court. I live with her again.   She will only let me see him 3 weeks in the summer, and 4 days of Christmas break, or a combination of Thanksgiving and Spring break.      It's getting worse and worse. She wont send me away. I know have a 7 year old (they are all 1/2) brother, 4 year old brother, and 1 year old twin brother and sister.      I am the oldest.      She like the 7 year old the most. It's quite depressing. I can't do ANYTHING. She is ALWAYS screaming at me, and making fun of me. She is teaching my brothers it's okay to pick on Lexi, but not other people.   I'm sick of it. She wont LET me go to a group home, women's shelter, loony bin, or to my dad's house where I want to go.      At school, my friends are now friends with the f*cking cheater who started this BS.      Sometime

He engaged to this girl named keisha who is a model that makes like 1 or 2 million a year.

He also says that he wants to divorce her and drain as much out of her for payback because she used to make fun of him in high school because he was considered to be nerdy or overweight and he wants to show her and everyone who teased him how wicked he is.

I always have dreams about being in a movie theater and watching the screen. Often, there are two different screens that I am watching. I also dream about school and shopping often. I am home schooled and have dreamed about being back at regular school, though I would never even consider that right now.   Anyways, last night I dreamed about being in a movie theater watching the uninvited.

So, I decided to act drunk in the picture and my boob fell out and she took the pic and I said it was child p o rn.   Ummm..what does this dream mean and what does it mean if you dream about movie theaters all the time? I really want to be an actress if that helps.   Thanks for reading this. xoxo

20090131100017AAmSeLG	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Why wouldn't my mother buy me a Ken doll when I was a child?	I remember having an assortment of Barbies as a child, but never a Ken doll. I desperately wanted a Ken doll because I wanted to make the Ken doll dance with the Barbies, marry them, have a harem, etc. I remember going to a toy store with my mother and sneakily trying to replace the Barbie doll she was buying me with a Ken doll, but she noticed it. She said, "Vat is tis? Ugh, it's man doll! Tis is not toy for little girls. I am disgusted by tis country, vhy they sell MAN doll to little girls? You get man doll vhen you are married and have husband, that's your man doll. This doll, vhright here *chucks it behind her* let some pedophile buy it."       I never understood why she thought the Ken doll was vulgar and wrong. To me a Ken doll is no different from a Barbie doll, both are modeled after adults, albeit unrealistic adults.

She will show me the steps to complete a task but will leave out the most important piece of information that I need to get it finished and be able to do the task again. Shes very condescending to me and I would like to address it with her but do not want to start anything because she still needs to teach me some things that would affect whether Ill make it thru training or get the boot. I dont want there to be icky feelings but she talks to me like Im her child sometimes and gets very snippy when I least expect it. She seems threatened that the Dr and I get along very well and that the patients like me a lot. I need this job to support my family while my husband is in school. What can I do??? The Dr knows a little about this but I dont want to go running to him everytime I need advice on how to handle her. She also hints about things a lot though Ive asked her to be direct with me b/c Im not the type to get my feelings hurt easily-I want it all out there on the table. She is super sensitive and gets paranoid when she isnt involved in a conversation the Dr and I are having. Help!!! Im usually very good at these things but this has me stumped!

20090131131834AAgqWXM	Social Science;Psychology	I don't know why I'm like this. I'm sort of anti-social, but....(details inside)?	Okay, so I have barely any friends at school yet I like being at school better than being at home. When I'm at home I get depressed. Whenever it's Friday instead of being like "Yay! It's almost the weekend!" I'm depressed because I know there will be no one to hang out with over the weekend, nothing fun to do, etc...      But the thing is, I like being at school because I'm happier when I'm surrounded by people, even though I rarely talk and don't have many friends. At home, I sometimes stop what I'm doing and go see what my family is doing (if they're watching TV I might go do that), because even though my family annoys me and I don't get along with them, I feel better when I'm around people.      At school I'm a lot more outgoing once I get to know someone, but if I don't know anybody in a class then I'll sit there quietly through the whole period. Usually people talk to me and we become friends, not me talk to them.      I want to know how to be more outgoing. Is making friends harder once you're in high school than it is in middle/elementary? I don't know anyone from Elementary/Middle school because I was homeschooled. I feel left out and people wonder why I don't talk but I don't even really know myself. Sometimes it's like there's an invisible barrier stopping me from talking to people or something. But once I know someone I'll talk without thinking sometimes.

For some reason, I was sitting on a wheel chair the whole dream. First, we were in a really big house and had a party. Then, we went to an area with an amazing view , but then we had to leave because it turned out to be a train track. We tried to find the mansion again, so we went on elevator and through stores. I told them to wait and I quickly looked through a book store/cafe. Then I saw a girl that I'm trying to be friends with at my new school(in real life) with her friends. But in my dream, I was too shy so I went back to my friends. They weren't there. I asked some people and they said they had no clue where they went....   Then my dream was over.

20090131122256AARaWyN	Social Science;Psychology	I'm curious about hypnosis... yet nothing seems to work?	I'm curious about hypnosis... I just want to know what it feels like to lose control and have my hands stuck together or have a post-hypnotic suggestion. I've read some things people said about what it feels like... but I guess I want to experience it. I've also read about self-hypnosis, but I don't think it's the same thing as hypnosis (I don't see how you lose control from yourself to yourself...)      I've watched several (5 or so) "self-hypnosis" videos on YouTube, but none of them worked. I tried -- I really did. I put my full concentration into what the vids were telling me to do... I even convinced myself that I was hypnotized once until toward the end of the video the thought popped into my mind, "Will this guy ever stop talking?" At which point, I concluded that I was not in a trance. When one video said, "you cannot open your eyes. Try to open them", I even psyched myself into believed that my eyes would get glued shut. To my disappointment, they popped wide open.      With that said, I know that I'm not unsuggestable because I've passed a suggestibility test (where you imagine that you have a balloon in one hand, rock in the other).      So, now I finally get around to asking my question. How can I experience what it's like to be hypnotized? I'm just curious and want to know. I'm not going to pay to go to a hypnotherapost just for curiosity's sake, and I've never been to a stage hypnotist show.      Does anyone have any suggestions? Perhaps, has anyone discovered a hypnosis for the hard-to-hypnotize video?
20090131120925AA6Id8p	Social Science;Psychology	How important is it to read in order to stay intellectually sharp?	I realize that I can probably answer my own question, but I notice a trend over the years that when I read frequently, I feel sharp, and at the top of my game mentally. However, if I neglect to read for even a short period of time, if I start up again, it often poses a short term problem, and my retention has seemed to decline, is this normal? Reading is something that I really enjoy doing, and from here on out, want to include it in my daily life.

20090131130049AA6bjUQ	Social Science;Psychology	FREE-WILL..does it really exist..help me understand OTHERWISE?	I think the idea of free-will & have given it a lot of thought- I think that it doesn't really exist ...i want you to help me understand otherwise if true.   Here's what i think:   We are limited beings who live according to limited conditions...      Every choice that you believe that you are freely taking is just an illusion that you want your mind to believe. The fact that you decide to listen to this romantic song & not a rock song is because of events & past & current experiences that make your present mood the way it is now which leads you to listen to a romantic song...you do not choose to....         I am posting this question here because of curiosity..curiosity that God embedded in us..i am helpless..i cannot fight the fact that this issue is bugging me deeply & i don't think i can put a meaning to life without an explanation to it....      The only way i can think of free-will is if God really exists and the only condition which enables you to freely choose is to either choose God ,if he truly exists, or to continue being brainwashed by this world's fake and shitty values and morals....the concept of free-will is made-up...we can never be free unless we die...we must be unlimited beings....      so tell me what you think...true?...or help me understand otherwise..thank you
20090131124913AAvcbyT	Social Science;Psychology	I'm worried about how I'm feeling. Please help.?	I'm starting to feel jealous about other people I know. I don't feel like this all the time and I swear that I'm not a bad person.    I guess it stems from me coming back from university two years ago and seeing that all my close friends have grown up and seem to have their own lives. I still haven't managed to re-adjust.   I'm more angry with myself than these other people in that I'm wondering how come I haven't managed to get the jobs they have done.   Probably more so is their social standing in that they all tend to be in relationships and are able to go out frequently, whereas I'm always at home battling with assignments from this other course I'm doing. Or I'm just shy and not confident enough. What is more worrying is that some of these people are about 3 years younger than me.   I feel I spend too much time envying them and not caring about where I am going in the future. I sometimes feel i'm going to fail even before I've started, whether its applying for a job or asking a girl out. I tend to use past experiences far too often as a reference.   I don't what to start hating these people, but at the same time I don't want to view myself with such contempt either. I'm wondering whether I should try and talk to a psychiatrist.   Do you have any ideas how I can thinking so negatively.

20090131112018AAtnkhr	Social Science;Psychology	PLEASE HELP should i be worried about this?	im not sure where to go to ask about this...    ive been working at a privately owned retail store for about 1 1/2 yrs. when i started there is was pretty nice, relaxing, etc...    but right now... i dont know how to say this and make it short for you to read-    we use to have cameras up in the store, but they were taken down. the boss is now putting them back up again - not a problem- except for the fact that they are pointing straight down, to where the person watching the camera can see down peoples shirts...    One of my friends who has worked there a lot longer than me said that when the old cameras were first put up he had done that with those too. then employees were complaining about it ( he quickly fired them) and somewhere along the lines after that he angled them so they weren't pointed straight down...    well now- with the new cameras like that again, it makes me wonder.       to give examples of the conflicting thoughts im having:   1- when i started he made a joke about how the cameras were there so he could see down girls shirts   2- i remember one day i came in and he tried to hide the fact that he was looking at a porn magazine before i walked in ( but hid the evidence very poorly)    3- he smells my perfume every day i work with him.    4- he says weird comments here and there and likes to touch my back when he walks past me   BUT   5- he has never made an actual pass at me   6- a lot of people like to smell my perfume   7- i am a little overly sensitive when guys touch me because of my past, so i quite often get nervous when i dont really need to be   8- perhaps my friend was lying about the old cameras   9- but she has never lied to me before   10- I just in plain get overly sensitive about this stuff, so i never know if im over-reacting.      what do i do?    do i wait to see if he moves the cameras?    is this really as creepy as i feel it is?   am i over-reacting?    is this something i should worry about?      please help

20090131122654AAaAvKT	Social Science;Psychology	Is suicide a valid option?	To be fair, I'm not currently in bad enough shape to do it, but sometimes I get close to it.  I've talked to suicide hot lines, have had counselors in the past, but I've often just wanted to ask what people think, ask how people feel about it.      The main thing that's stopped me from doing it in the past was that I felt it wasn't fair to the people who loved or cared about me, that they didn't do anything wrong so I wouldn't want to hurt them.  But I've been feeling like I don't have anyone left, so that reason isn't so much of a reason anymore.        I've been looking at it in terms of "what comes after", if anything, but that's not a good way to look at it either.  As I see it, there's a few possibilities.  I get judged by some invisible deity who tosses me into torment for giving up his "gift", or I just plain cease to exist (in which case suicide would be fine because.. well, I'm dead, why would I care anymore?), or I end up in some completely different sort of afterlife of my own design.  It's not like anyone really knows what's after.      Sometimes I want to do it.. just to get that answer.  I may not be able to tell anyone else, but I want to know the answer once and for all.

What do you think the world would be like if we decided to abolish the monetary system, in favor of a more diverse method of choosing who lives with or without what?       I just hate the idea of money. It's so segregate. You either have it, and therefore you have everything, or you don't have it, and subsequently youhave nothing... Shouldn't we, as human beings, realize that we are the only species on the planet that condemn our own kind to abjection because of a difference in mental ability and societal nuances? Shouldn't we be moving onward with our own evolutionary path already? We have the means, the ideas and the structure necessary to implement these fundamentals, that everyone should have a piece of something. Why can it not be done...For the betterment of our future generations? Because, if you think about it...90% of the wealth in 10%    of the population, in futuristic terms, means that many billions upon billions of people will be the have-nots. And they will most likely be your relatives.      ...Just something to think about while you carry on with your everyday existence.

20070430173025AAh16qc	Social Science;Psychology	I have problems.?	Im 16 and in grade 11..  I have quite a few friends, but I'm still not happy, and I dont know what will make me happy.  I am lonely and really want a girlfriend.  I talk to alot of girls but I don't know at what point I should ask them out, and it also seems like all the good ones are taken.      I have a high self image, until I'm at work.  I work at a grocery store stocking but for some reason as soon as I go to work my self image drops drastically.  I always feel like I'm too serious at work and think that when I'm at work I seem like this to everyone, but really outside of work I'm playful and funny, but when I go to work my personality almost changes.  Same with when I ride my motorbike, I always think everyone thinks im a biker.      I also always have to buy clothes to cheer myself up, I dont know why, but if I'm not wearing something brand new I feel like ****.  I'm a boy so I know this is weird...      I'm failing my classes at school and I don't know how to change my life around.

20080404103657AAofRXd	Social Science;Sociology	Si estas orgulloso de Ser Mexicano?, Ayudame!?	Primero quiero hacer algo muy claro.  En ninguna forma es mi intension ofender, insultar, or faltar al respeto a nuestra raza.  Lo que voy a decir lo digo muy sinceramente porque realmente necesito alluda.  Gracias por la pasiensia en leer y disculpen la mala puntuacion.   Soy Mexicana y he vivido en los E.U. desde los 11.  Tengo 32 anos ahora y dos ninos de 2 y 6.  El problema que tengo es que ahora me he dado cuenta que no siento mucho orgullo de lo que soy.  Quizas por tantas cosas que se miran aqui de los mexicanos q viven aqui como tantos muchachos en gangas, ignorancia, y tantas cosas negativas.  Nunca he podido mirar las rezones por las que devo de estar orgullosa de lo que soy.  Ahora q tengo hijos qusiera saber como puedo yo aprender a sentir orgulloza de mi cultura pero realmente no se como acerlo, o de que sentirme orgullosa.  Mis padres nunca me ensenaron a sentirme orgullosa de ser mexicana.  Recuerdo que mi padre en mexico era un gerente de unos pueblos en B.C..

20081013011859AAj8pIv	Social Science;Psychology	Problems in Social Situations ?	I always look like a nervous wreck in social situations. I don't know how to hold myself. It's not that I'm neccissarily nervous, just akward. I don't know how to posture my body when standing up talking to someone, I don't know where to put my arms, I don't know how to move my arms when walking I've always been told I walk like a robot and a lot of the time I don't what facial expression to use when reacting to someone a lot of the time. It's like I stiffen up in public. I was at a party once, everyone was sitting around a table, chilled and relaxed, and I was sitting there upright looking like a stiff board, shifting my eyes around the table. People noticed it as well.       Any suggestions on how to pull myself through this guys?
20081028052732AAwtcmy	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Dreaming of blood and fainting?	I had this dram that I need thing device to help me breath, tubes went through my chest and in my stomach, It was like I could feel the pain of this device as I carried it around. I needed to have it for three days and then I could have it taken out...Then I was in the hospital with a nurse asking me if I wanted her to phone an ambulance, I said yes, then she asked me if I want her to phone the police, I said no, then the nurse sat me up on the bed and removed the tube from my stomach, as she was starting to remove the tube I could see blood coming out and then when she took out the whole tube blood was then pouring out, like dumping out a bucket of water, Then it was really weird, it was like I could feel myself passing out, I could feel, that I was loosing my life..I have never felt anything like that before....Why would I have had this dream?

20090131103456AAcTwiL	Social Science;Psychology	Dream interpretation-please help- really freaky dream; MY GRANDMA, ME AT THE MOVIES, NUDITY?	I always have dreams about being in a movie theater and watching the screen. Often, there are two different screens that I am watching. I also dream about school and shopping often. I am home schooled and have dreamed about being back at regular school, though I would never even consider that right now.    Anyways, last night I dreamed about being in a movie theater watching the uninvited. Then, I was in a room with my grandmother who was trying to take a picture of me, but I did not want my picture taken. So, I decided to act drunk in the picture and my boob fell out and she took the pic and I said it was child p o rn.   Ummm..what does this dream mean and what does it mean if you dream about movie theaters all the time? I really want to be an actress if that helps.   Thanks for reading this. xoxo
