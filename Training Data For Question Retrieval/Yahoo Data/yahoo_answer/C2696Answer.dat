YuTFG3feaa	You have to be consistent with disciplining him just as you would your dog.  You finger may have the scent of food causing him to bite, or he could be doing it because he is teething.  I tend to think it is the teething.  Make sure he has plenty of items to teeth on.  Just get him the same teething toys as you would a small breed dog.  You might even get him a small rawhide chew to teeth on. You can try giving him a teething toy or rawhide immediately when he starts to nibble on you.  Hopefully my suggestions will be of some help to you.  Congrats on your new ferret.  He will bring you a lot of joy.  I adored mine, she was so much fun.  Good luck!  LOL|`|HyAcX3Jxaa	hes obviously sexulally fustrated, just tell him you're not ready for a relationship.|`|jyGTlpzTaa	Never EVER EVER EVER SMACK YOUR FERRET ANYWHERE!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  EVER!<br>  <br>  Continue with scruffing, it takes a while for ferrets to get the message, they are stubborn animals, it could take up to a year for your fert to stop nipping. They nip each other in play, its something that needs to be understood, he's not trying to hurt you he wants to play.<br>  <br>  He is not in pain, the eye closure and yawning are just reflexes, but make sure his back feet remain on the floor when you scruff, lifting the whole body up puts strain on the neck. Dont shake when you grab by the scruff, ferrets are too delicate you risk hurting him. Just holding him up is enough.<br>  <br>  Another way is to place a finger in the mouth when the ferret bites, and hold his head so he cant let your finger go for about five seconds...make sure you dont jam his tongue down his throat, but they hate this sensation.<br>  <br>  Ferrets love to attack toes...get some Bitter apple/lemon/lime for that from your pet shop, or try spraying him with water when he tries it..<br>  <br>  Dont use a carrier or cage to punish the ferret for biting, he or she will associate the cage or the carrier with punishment, and when you cage the ferret or take them to the vet they will get stressed out, and will become impossible to catch when they are out playing.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you need to understand the ferret more. They are curious, naughty and mischevious creatures, when you tell them off for biting they will immediately do it again because they know its forbidden. It can take a long time for them to get the message. Also, it is normal for some adult, well behaved ferrets to give nips in play, some of them just continue doing it throughout.|`|872fcc76954a83920779a9df510b118baa	actually he is kind of being a baby.  it makes him tired and relaxed for the moment he is in your scruff.  I would avoid shaking him though when you're trying to keep him from aggression, ferrets can be kind of testy.  if you keep up with training him by saying  a firm no and grabbing him by scruff he will eventually learn that is not something to do with you.  you'll be very proud after having taught him the lesson so it's all worth the patience  (i used to have a ferret that loved socks!!  he niped our feet all the time!)  also they love play time and treats.  SO when he learns what is acceptable and fun to you he will start acting more like a cheerful but hardly mistaken member of your family  :)  Good luck
TkbaEic0aa	can he walks probably?? is he eating and drinking??<br>  is he feel pain while doing no1 or no2 on his tray?? if not then he is just feeling bored?? i guess..<br>  try to mention that to the doc on your next visit to the vet :)<br>  hope he'll be back to normal before that itself :)<br>  <br>  is it too hot for the cat.. cats usually stick their tongue outside to reduce their temperature, you should make sure that your cat is having enough water... try to notice her chest does it breath really hard and fast, even if the cat's in cool area, then you should go to check with the vet?? i'm sorry to say it could be sumthing wrong with the cat... i wish you had done more research about that kind of cats... it's sumthing not normal?? <br>  i'm jus surprise how human turns god's creature to sumthing goes with their need and desires.. wuts wrong with the big normal cats.. they even more adorable.. you don't how much i'm happy to have two large cats.. and cant wait for my kitten to be huge jus like the other two cats..|`|fgxajTiBaa	Holy crap this "teacup" is actually going into cats now?! MAN...you really can't fix stupid.|`|4aAhEK9daa	GET IT TO THE VET!<br>  <br>  Gosh, I'm SO surprised that a "teacup" Persian has some medical issues!  And so SHOCKING that the breeder "didn't know about this".<br>  <br>  There's NO SUCH THING AS TEACUP PERSIANS.  Anyone claiming they're selling something called that is a BACKYARD BREEDER purposely breeding cats to make extra small kittens so that fools like you will pay a large amount of money for something "cutesy".  Well you know what "cutesy" means to these animals?  Tiny organs that can't support their bodies.  Hearts that literally EXPLODE.  Hypoglycemia.  Anemia.  And since this is a Persian, most likely PKD as well.<br>  <br>  Polycystic Kidney Disease is an early onset form of kidney disease that Persians are genetically predisposed to.  Reputable breeders test all of their cats for this disease and never breed PKD positive animals.  Backyard breeders - like those selling "teacup" animals DO NOT.  And this means that they end up selling PKD positive kittens that can end up going into renal failure - and dying - as early as four years.  But then, this is a "teacup" animal - I doubt it will even make it to two years.<br>  <br>  Tell me the breeder and I would bet you $1,000 there is NOTHING on their website about PKD.  Because ALL they care about is MAKING MONEY.  They could care less that your cat drops dead.  They've already laughed their way to the bank.  Shame on you for supporting people like this.|`|3Ophdo9raa	It's a kitten, so it's mimicing what the dogs do.  I recommend you get another kitten so they can keep each other company and remind each other that they're cats. I recommend that for all pets--get two. They'll also imprint on each other and not you (or another species in this case). That's funny though. I wouldn't worry though unless it stops eating.|`|dWed21jUaa	percy is right.

cI7CmNGyaa	I've been scratched by stray cats quite a few times due to patting them (also once bitten by a dog) and I haven't been to see a doctor after that and I'm okay. <br>  <br>  Its just people like my parents who make a fuss about them (my dad went to get an injection after a hamster bite and my mom telling me off for patting strays). <br>  <br>  Anyways, if you're worried, you should go visit your local doctor. I'm sure you're fine but to be safe, you'd have to get an injection anyway.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped ^^|`|hpeCvV6Caa	eeek umm i dunno. there is a big chance as there is most likely to be saliva on the paws of the cat at any time. ooo well you might start to feel a little queazy, if so go straight to the hospital. you wont have long if so. good luck.|`|4CMx1uzXaa	I have been scratched so many times from cats (stray and domestic) and I feel fine.. oh... no hang on........ arggghhhhhh.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  only joking- you will be fine stop worrying.|`|AA11589437	Where do you live? Are you in a country where rabies is all over the animals? Because anywhere in the western world I wouldn't worry about a cat scratch. <br>  Anyway, the only thing you can do is to keep an eye on the kitten and make sure she is OK in the next ten days. If she had rabies, she would die within 10 days. But if she looked healthy and was not foaming from her mouth, I'd say you needn't worry. Your mum knows best, if she's not worried about it you shouldn't be either.<br>  As for the size of the scratch it is irrelevant, if the cat was rabid you would need to get a shot regardless of the scratch size, if she was OK you needn't worry, again even if the scratch was big.|`|URuzNGcyaa	how I understand it, rabies is transferred via saliva from a bite - not a scratch, so you will be fine|`|V8rV38yfaa	The rabies virus enters the body through a cut or scratch, or through mucous membranes (such as the lining of the mouth and eyes), and travels to the central nervous system.<br>  When an infected animal bites another animal, the rabies virus is transmitted through the infected animal's saliva. Scratches by claws of rabid animals are also dangerous because these animals lick their claws/paws.<br>  <br>  Chances of getting rabies is much higher from a bite than a scratch, but it is still possible and law requires that any animal that bites or scratches someone be quarantined (at the owner's expense) for 10 days to make sure they do not exibit any signs of the virus. The animal will receive a rabies vaccine after the 10 day quarantine. Rabies vaccines are required by law, so make sure you keep your cat up to date at all times, by protecting your cat....you are also protecting yourself and your family.<br>  <br>  Even if you are ever unsure if your pet had already been vaccinated, it does not hurt to have the vaccine administered again.....better safe, that sorry!
aCqSF87Raa	Just sit her down and ask her - mom, when summer time rolls around can we talk about getting a dog? That's the best and only thing you can really do. In the mean time, try to impress her. <br>  <br>  Get a job (even if it's part time or very few hours) to help earn a little bit of money, research dog breeds to see which one best fits your WHOLE family (consider energy level, grooming needs, etc), pick up chores to help her out. And don't use your grades as leverage - that would be the pet peeve of MANY parents, as your grades are VERY important. Too important to threaten them just for a dog.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that unless you are old enough and work enough hours per week, mom will be the one to pay for this dog - that's a good thousand bucks for starters. And about $150 per month after (more if grooming/training is needed.) Emergency costs can cost over a thousand. And all this on top of the $1500+ she pays per month for the needs of the family (house, cars, bills, etc.)<br>  <br>  Also keep in mind that she WORKS to pay for this stuff, so she may not want the hassle of a dog. Which is why you must PROVE to her that you will help out.

SoarXprOaa	If you are planning on crabbing, then I assume that you already have the basics such as the crab pots, lines, labled flags and of course, your crabbing license. What has worked the best for me is to put old or new fish heads, guts, bones, chicken parts, fish. Put it inside of cheese cloth or a nylone sock, put that in the bait pot, and that's your bait. When you pull the crabs out of the pot, which I assume you already know how to do, if you don't then you will find out instantly how (they pich outrageously hard) if you do get piched, don't panic, it will extremely hurt, but put the crab and whatever body part pinched down and wait for it to let go. Anyway, get the crab and look at it's underside, the females generally have a slightly darker and "dirtier" look to them, they will have a wide rounded "V" on their underside. Males have a long thin "V" on their underside. You should also take out your guage and measure the widest point of the crab to each end of the guage. If it is a male and is big enough, you've caught yourself a crab.|`|MtERSUVzaa	Crabs are scavengers that eat dead, often rotting meat and fish. What are you doing with a crab, for heaven's sake?

2IhKJjY1aa	Depending on the size of the fish you could add a lot more.  How about some clown loaches.  They are very colorful and fun to watch.  However, you should get at least 3-5 of them because they swim in schools.  They are mostly bottom feeders so they should help to keep your tank clean.  They are also great if you have a snail problem as they love to eat them.|`|Hh9sRoZMaa	That sound okie. I'll suggest that you put some "sucker" fish to help clean up the waste and keep your water cleaner for a slightly longer time. Anyway they usually stays either on the wall or the bottom so wouldn't take up too much space of the other fishes.

5i8lDbXfaa	First STOP brushing the mane and tails all the time, I only brush my horses mane and tail maybe once a month (if not longer) or before a show.  Instead use your fingers to get the knots or dreadlocks out, put some baby oil on the tough knots to help work them out.

This way you can slowly remove any tangles without damaging the hair.  It takes awhile, but if you commit to doing it a few times a week it will be a less of a job.  Also as they live out, you could put a loose running plait in the mane, and re-do it everyday- this will help stuff getting stuck in the hair.|`|BI1GbIZUaa	I use lots of show sheen and cowboy magic gel conditioner.

Don't comb when it's too wet or you'll snap the hairs.  When it's nearly dry spray on some mane shine (there are loads of different ones, but I do love Cowboy Magic) then leave it alone!

I leave her mane in big, loose braids (only 2 or 3 of them) and put electrical tape around them instead of a hair tie, because they pull out hair.

86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	There's no magic number answer to this. Numbers depend on the individual specie's needs and the dimensions of your tank (long has better stocking than tall). Which is why the inch per gallon rule DOESN'T work!!<br>  <br>  Are your Platys males or females? If they're both males I would suggest 2-3 more males, 3 more Corys (of the same species you have now) and you're done.|`|aCDWwsisaa	A general "rule of thumb" for a well-filtered & well-oxygenated tank is "an inch of fish per gallon"....  70 liters is about 18.5 gallons, so the total length of fish you can comfortably keep in there is 18.5 inches.<br>  <br>  Once all your current fish reach adult size, it sounds likely you'll reach that limit...|`|vy8SRHxlaa	well it depends on the fish, if you want just small fish like you have now, so for example tetras, probably 30 or so but as you go bigger you can have far less. If you wanted more platies or mollies etc then I would say 10 more and your getting full.<br>  <br>  Plus ignore the 1 inch of fish per gallon rule people are gonna tell you, its not that accurate, different fish have different waste outputs etc. Commonsense is best in my opinion, as long as the fish have plenty of space to move and you keep up water changes weekly and don't overfeed, you'll be fine.|`|BMri9tITaa	I'd say add two or three more corys and you're done.<br>  <br>  Sounds like a very pretty tank, though!|`|mvrygTYTaa	In the USA, working with gallons they tell you that you should have 1 fish per gallon. 1 Gallons (US) = 3.78541178 Liters

However this cat wasn't brain damaged, he lived to tell the tail. I think this cat was applied the Frontline Plus dog formular.<br>  <br>  Products containing permethrin, as well as other ingredients at higher concentrations and labeled "for dogs only," should never be used on cats. Cats have a very sensitive metabolism, so using these products on cats or even allowing your cat close contact with a dog that has been recently treated should be avoided.<br>  <br>  Never use a product with permethrin on your cat. Although these products have a wide margin of safety for dogs, they can be toxic to cats. Cats exposed to permethrin can develop tremors and/or seizures within hours of application. If you suspect your cat has been exposed to permethrin or other insecticides toxic to cats, see your veterinarian immediately. <br>  <br>  I find it really odd, that a vet suggest you could use dog products on a cat. I'm glad you did seek a vet though.<br>  <br>  Warning<br>  Never use flea treatment marketed for dogs on a cat without first checking with your vet. While some canine flea treatments can safely be used on cats, many are toxic and can quickly kill a cat. Also be cautious of natural treatments containing essential oils, like lavender or eucalyptus oils. Cats cannot metabolize the compounds in many essential oils and can go into liver failure if exposed to them. Always read and follow packaging directions on any flea treatment, especially if it says it is not safe for kittens or pregnant or nursing cats. If you decide to use DE, buy food grade DE online or from a pet or health food store. It is also sold for pool filters, but the pool filter DE contains other chemicals and is not safe for other uses<br>  <br>  Safety Tips for "Pour On" Flea Medications: <br>  <br>  <br>  Use products ONLY as directed. <br>  <br>  Never apply dog flea medication to a cat! <br>  <br>  Apply medication to an area where your pet can't reach to lick.<br>  <br>  Use the product recommended for the weight of your pet.<br>  <br>  Do not combine flea products unless instructed by your veterinarian. Incorrect combinations can cause toxicity! <br>  If you use over-the-counter medications, use only as directed. Take very special care to monitor cats and small dogs for 24 hours after administration if using a product containing permethrin or pyrethrin<br>  <br>  I suggest you have a shower and scrub yourself down, you also might want to contant the poison information line.

qeOlkRM0aa	As a rule, the large chains don't take good care of their parrots. Most don't know how to care for birds, and as a result they tend to get little or no human interaction. Not only is that bad for socialization, it is psychologically damaging to the bird. If the parrot doesn't sell, they tend to get shuffled from store to store periodically, leaving an emotionally scarred parrot. This also means they tend to be older than one may wish. There are exceptions of course, but they are rare.|`|cfblRvE3aa	I disagree and agree there are pros and cons to pet stores<br>  <br>  cons<br>  <br>  price-pet stores buy there birds from breeders so they have to of the price usually doubling it.Most people not knowing that you can buy straight from breeders two.<br>  <br>  sociability  - pet stores do have allot t of people so you would think that the birds would be more social.This is not true especially for cocktails and parakeets these spices seem to be bout from breeders that supposedly hand feed them.But considered hand feeding dropping a hand full of food in the cage.<br>  <br>  bird mills-some pet store buy there  birds from bird mills.These dirty rusted cages poor all seed diets small crammed s with poor treeted parents.<br>  <br>  profit-most breeders do it for there love of birds.Pet stores do it for profit lower over filling overfilling cages and more.they also cary toxic bird  supplies use they make a 75%profit.<br>  <br>  this is not to say that there are not good ones just ask questions and be shure that the bird is physically and personality wise.<br>  <br>  what to look for<br>  <br>  <br>  fully  <br>  shows intrest<br>  not over crowded<br>  clean<br>  no bad smells<br>  clear eyes nose and mouth <br>   good diet<br>  <br>  breedbreedersstill the best cheaper sweeter and honest.|`|dO0cb4yBaa	Another main reason is that there are a lot of birds that have been abandoned and turned over to avian rescues.

There are a lot of birds in rescues right now in need of a caring person to adopt them.

You don't know where the birds come from. Many pet shops will not check what kind of facilities the bird was born in, they just take it and sell it. It could be from a bird mill where it is forced weaned and not handled and loved by people at all. Buying them supports these horrible places.<br>  <br>  It could also be inbred from some people who just own birds and they  happened to breed. However, I know for a fact that some breeders who rear their birds well will give them to pet shops for various reason.<br>  <br>  Many (although I would say not most) birds at stores are sick in one way or another.<br>  <br>  2. In the US, there is a real problem with neglected birds needing adoption from rescue centres.<br>  <br>  If you really want to get the bird from the store, they should let you handle it, watch closely for any abnormalities. If possible, get someone experienced with birds to come along with you. Ask them if they know the history of the bird and where it came from.<br>  Not all pet shop birds are bad... you can get some LOVELY companion parrots from a pet shop.<br>  <br>  However, breeders are better because they tend to be brought up well and loved and handled (depending on the breeder), you get to talk to the breeder directly who is experienced with birds. And the bird is so much more cheaper compared to a pet shop!<br>  <br>  If you are considering a species that is frequently seen in rescue centres, it would be well worth a look there as well.|`|QZ3eucYWaa	So much negativity is shown to chain pet stores for tons of reasons.

We go the extra mile for the animals and say screw the fact that it doesn't follow "P&P" and could possibly lose our jobs just for the animals.

Don't let anyone talk you away from a pet you feel a connection with. If you walk into a few stores, talk to a few different breeders and your heart is stuck with a bird from petsmart then buy the one from petsmart. This especially applies with birds because they have a higher end of intelligence and show more of their personality - we say "You don't choose the bird, the bird chooses you".<br>  Just be sure that you do research on whatever type of bird it is and make sure it is happy and healthy.<br>  Good luck hun|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	100's of reasons....But if you want to get one there go right ahead and do so.

Also you have no idea how the birds were raised.  You have seen the puppy mills, some stores get their birds from the cheapest place.  After a bird gets to the store it not treated properly.  If you go to an exotic bird store, you will see how much different the birds are treated.  These birds are taken out and handled every day.  They hand wean their babies right in the store in the nursery.  They don't allow people to poke at their birds or allow dogs to walk by and bark at them.  THeir cages are immaculate and all the employees love and have many birds of their own.
At6PDQvOaa	Could you please state the size of your tank?<br>  Angel fish should be kept in a 30gal tank at least. They may eat smaller tank mates, so no small tetras. Large tetras are okay.

AA12083992	Here are some tips to help convince your dog you are alpha. 1) You eat first, alpha's always eat first,2) When you feed your dog put your dog in a sit, stay. Set the food down and wait for half a minute or so before giving the free command. Alpha's control the food. 3) You go up and down stairs and through doorways first. Alpha's lead, they do not follow. 4) Only allow your dog to lick you under the chin. When one dog greets another, the inferior one will lick and grovel under the chin, whereas the alpha will groom the other assertively on the neck and back.5) Do not allow your dog to sleep in your bed. This gives the dog the idea you are equals, littermates so to speak.|`|9d8438febeda9f081685c3c773c13d90aa	It's not what you "do" but more how you "feel".. !<br>  You'r dog needs to absolutley feel and understand that YOU are the ruler of the roost !<br>  I would suggest that you research Cesar's methods...My dog used to think that he ruled the roost around here until I adopted his methods !|`|UKpNiRf6aa	There is no equality in dogdom. You’re either ahead or behind your dog in line and that is decided by how you interact with your dog. Being a good leader means being calm, kind and consistent. Here are a few suggestions: <br>  <br>  ? Teach your dog to control his mouth. If he mouths or nips you, react with a stern “No biting!” This will teach him that you are not another puppy and he needs to treat you differently. <br>  ? Have him ‘sit’ or ‘down’ before you give him anything he wants, from petting to tossing a toy. When he responds to you before you respond to him, he will start to look to you to set the rules, while at the same time getting in daily training practice. <br>  ? Practice submission exercises daily. These include holding him in your arms or on his side and speaking to him gently until he stops squirming. When he stops, release him, praise and give him a kibble of food. Gently handle his ears, mouth and paws so he learns to accept this. These exercises are easy with most dogs but if your dog really struggles or gets upset, consult your veterinarian or seek assistance from a qualified dog trainer. <br>  ? Use tone of voice to communicate. A higher than normal pitch is exciting and playful and perfect for praise. A normal tone - direct and confident – is your command tone. A lowered voice your dog hears as a warning, like a growl. With practice, your puppy can learn to understand your mood through your tone of voice. <br>  ? You and your family should eat in your dog's presence, and do so before setting out the dog food. Among dogs, the most important dogs always eat first. <br>  ? Walk through doors first. <br>  ? Remember: Pack leaders NEVER share their food with other dogs. If you follow all of the steps above and then give your dog table scraps and bites of your sandwich you are sending mixed signals to your dog.<br>  <br>  If you do these things consistently, you can elevate yourself in your dog’s eyes, which can make all the difference in training.|`|sRcKPzQ0aa	Hii,<br>  A pack Leader is the No1 in the pack. In a dog world the pack leader has the responsibility for the survival of all the pack members.  Pack Leaders decide when to hunt, where to go, when to eat, who eats and how much and decides when to play and rest. <br>  Not many people are leaders, as is the same with dogs. Its much easier for them to follow. Dogs who are born leaders are a little more difficult to make a follower, but their need to be in a smooth running pack is much stronger than their instinct to be the pack leader. <br>  To be a pack leader its all about energy and understanding dogs and the way they see things. Dogs experience through nose, eyes, then ears. We experience through eyes, ears, nose. If you ever had the chance to see a wild pack of dogs or wolves it shouldn't take long to work out who is the pack leader. It would have a dominant posture, ears up, tail stiff, head alert and the chest forward. Being the pack leader is about confidence and energy. In a pack there is only two positions dominant or submissive, black or white.<br>  To be your dogs pack leader you need to project calm and assertive energy and have rules, boundaries and limitations for your dog. <br>  First of all you need to be able to tell who is the pack leader in your house, you can judge by this. When you come home, does your dog jump up on you? If yes, the dog isnt just happy to see you, the dog is the pack leader. If the dog walks in front of you, leaves the house first on the walk, the dog is the pack leader. If your dog barks at you at feeding time, the dog is the pack leader. When your dog waits at the door and you let him/her out, the dog is the pack leader. Whenever your dog 'tells' you to do something, he is the pack leader. Its as simple as that. You need to be the one who calls all the shots, you open the door when you want not the dog, you leave the house first, you decide when and where to go. That makes you the pack leader. If you give your dog the chance to lead, he/she will sure take it. <br>  Leading a dog on a walk is the best way to establish pack leadership, after all thats what dogs do. <br>  Hope ive been some help, Good Luck with becoming your dogs pack leader. <br>  :-)|`|X4NIyjUkaa	it would lead the pack where ever the pack and the leader goes,your dog needs to be the dominate dog and know to lead a pack of dogs or to pretty much be a pack leader.
oDVx7nSxaa	Sounds like he could have a problem with his ears - a yeast infection, or ear mites?  I'd take him back to the vet, and have them look at the wax in his ears under a microscope, and see what's living in there.   <br>  <br>  Persians tend to look much bigger than they really are with all that fur.  Is he bigger in weight, or does he just look bigger?  If he's really much bigger, it's very possible that he's older than you were told.  And if that's the case, I'd schedule his neuter for the very near future, so that he doesn't develop any nasty spraying habits.
9a55e586048b32bd3a4d8f1d55662f0aaa	well im not sure what kind ur wanting, but i had rats myself and i usually got some males. but i found out later down the road that th female rats had out lived the male rats. and yes a calm rat is destined to be sick later on and an active one will be more livelier long time to come. alwasy best to ask the pet shop if they have any problems with them. also let me point out that if they have a sneezing going on, then dont get them, cause they uslaly have a respitory infcetion and dies more faster than others do. the usuall life span of a rat is 2 to 3 yrs,i had my female rat for almost 5 yrs before she passed on. so its somehtign to think bout.also if have female and male rat, they usually have like 10 to 12 babies in their litters. if want to know anhting else, let me know. and oh by way never never give them soda, cause they will kill over in a matter of tme.smehting to think bout.|`|8474581acbbf3af73ba609e00ff353ecaa	Boys tend to be calmer, and more cuddly. <br>  I would recommend you get him neutered. <br>  As long as you clean the cage often, your rates won't smell. <br>  as for medical issues, they're both equally prone to problems.|`|y0fmBIP2aa	Girls are better, males mark their territory and it smells.|`|gVQ6es5Taa	Male rats are a lot calmer, more friendly and more able to bond to you than a female rat. The females tend to be skittish and harder to tame, although they are friendly. Unless you are at home all day everyday I advise you get two, they are extremely social animals and HATE being alone. Having two will not make much difference to the cost, and does not affect taming or bonding with you. It will also make you feel less guilty when your pet has to be in its cage alone all day. <br>  <br>  Both sexes smell, but the males won't be frisky unless there is a female rat nearby. I don't think medical risks are really that affected by the sex, both sexes get weird health issues. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't recommend getting any gender desexed (if by that you mean neutered) as performing any kind of surgery on an animal that small is very dangerous and that operation is completely unnecessary !<br>  <br>  Get two males, much nicer :)|`|XOmZoc5Naa	females are cleaner and they don't stink like the males ( the urine ), but males are better tempered than females.|`|BWez86Ldaa	First of all, rats are extremely sociable creatures, it's recommended that you not only have a pair of rats, but at least a trio! Our family consists, currently, of 9 rats, and we're adopting five more within the next three weeks! Pet rats who are "only children" tend to live a shorter, unhappier, more boring life than those who have buddies.<br>  <br>  Females: are more giddy than males, they tend to be here and there and exploring everything, but keep in mind that each rat has her own personality! In my experience, our females have had no more or less health issues than our males, but then again it's a 7 to 2 ratio right now, and it's not likely that we'll get more males. Females, however, do tend to get mammory tumors, generally benign. I more enjoy the presence of our females who are very active. <br>  <br>  Males: are, in general, more calm than females. Males also tend to be quite a bit more aggressive with other rats, unless neutered. Someone else "answered" that neutering can be dangerous, but the truth is that neutering a rat or other small animal is just as dangerous as neutering a dog or cat, just generally cheaper! As a rule of thumb, many experienced rat owners like to go ahead and neuter males *because* of their aggression tendencies. <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that rats are very expensive creatures to keep healthy! I, personally, have spent over 500$ in the past 6 months in vet bills, and this is my vet only seeing two of our rat babies. I could go on and on about rat care, but seeing as how I've answered your question, I simply suggest going to WWW.GOOSEMOOSE.COM to find out more about pet rats. Good luck and hope to see you on the forum!|`|JmD0oq2Naa	i have male rats and they do NOT stink. my males can be very calm but they also like to explore when i get them out, they will run about then come over to me and groom themselves|`|jyGTlpzTaa	You are asking for quite a lot there! Male rats tend to be lazy, and female rats tend to be squirmy and not enjoy being held. If you want an alert, active rat, again I'm going to tell you you need a pair because one rat will become lethargic and sleep all the time. In your position I'd probably go for one male and one female with the female spayed, because that way you have a lively one and a cuddly one.

You can try putting neosporin on it for two days and occasionally it'll come to a head and go down. However, 95% of the time he'll need to see a vet to have his ear lanced and drained. If you don't have access to a reptile vet, lancing and draining abcesses is a standard procedure in cats so any cat vet should be able to do that for you. Afterwards keep the wound open and put neosporin on it until it heals.<br>     Problems like ear infections do happen to good keepers with turtles in the best of conditions. However, it can be caused by keeping them too warm, so it's worth checking your temperatures. RES should have their water at around 70 to 77 degrees and the basking area at around 90 degrees.<br>     It is impossible to sex a 3-month old RES. You can look at his eye color and make a guess. Many times males have yellow eyes and females have brown ones. However, this is not a rule and as he matures later on you may find your guess was wrong. Males will develop a long tail with the cloaca located beyond the shell when the tail is extended and long, curved front claws. Females have shorter tails with the cloaca still inside the top shell when it is extended. They do not develop these characteristics until they approach breeding age though, and that is about when they reach 6 inches long.
EtHdFDHTaa	what type of substrate are you using? try this care sheet it has a lot of different options for substrate and how to treat each one.|`|xSdnsSojaa	Rosies are a desert species and they like it bone dry. No misting at all. A shallow water dish will give her all the humidity she needs (don't use those crappy "tarantula sponges" they sell in pet shops. They aren't necessary and can actually harm the spider). They have a habit of webbing over the entire floor of the tank if they don't like the substrate, so you may have to experiment with different types.<br>  <br>  Regardless of the condition of the substrate, it isn't unusual for the spider to be abnormally active - including climbing - until it becomes accustomed to its new surroundings. Also, she may feel insecure if you haven't provided a hide box. <br>  <br>  One more important point. No handling unless absolutely necessary. Rosies rarely bite, but tarantulas are very shy by nature and really don't appreciate being bothered. She'll do much better if you leave her alone.|`|CvJnp0iLaa	Try dampening just one area of the tank and leave the other side dry and see what it prefers.
AA12083992	Start with a vet, could be an infection or mites. Of course OTC's don't work, they usually do more harm than good. <br>  After the vet look at what you feed the dog. Has the food got corn in it? That can cause allergies. Our pets need quality  food. Read the ingredients list and learn what the stuff on there is and what it does (or does not do) to/for our pets. A quick pet food 101. If the pet food contains corn/corn products or by products it is a poor quality food. Corn is a filler that can trigger skin problems. (allergies, skin problems, itching and excessive shedding) By products is anything from an animal not fit for human consumption, including cancerous tissue. Do not pay attention to advertising, they all say there food is great. "Vet approved" means they have a vet on staff to approve their product. In other words, someone paid to approve it. Same with foods most vets recommend. Salesmen "gift" vets then the vet recommends the food. Most vets are not nutritionists! Quality foods have meat as the first ingredient Wellness, Solid Gold, Innova and Merrick are a few of the best brands available.

rQlzfHqraa	Have water, feed and grit (small stones) always available to chickens. Bread is OK now and then but it has ingredients that a chicken doesn't need. Any seed or grain is OK. You will need only five pounds of chick stater. When it is half done get layer pellets and start adding them to the starter. Laying pellets are OK for a rooster too. I always called my chickens and threw some chicken scratch feed on the ground. They love fruit and veggie scraps. Give oyster shell for laying hens as egg shells must be boiled first but you will be showing them that eggs can be eaten. A galvanized waterer is the best for a small flock and can be on a warming pad in colder weather. I always had wall mounted feeders and  a small one for th oyster shell.

AA11901352	First just using old water isn't going to fully cycle your tank nor do it immediately.<br>  <br>  Pitch the PH Balance it is already out of the tank once it cycles thru the filter  It isn't needed and is just another chemical added to the tank.  Your fish need a stable PH not one you keep changing.<br>  <br>  No ammonia remover either.  It isn't needed again another usless chemical that you are bombarding your fish with.  NOT needed.<br>  <br>  FIne with the bubble stone but again not needed.  Bubble stones do not add dissolved oxygen to the tank.  The filter itself does this.  They are decoration only.<br>  Good for using the old filter media however this won't automatically cycle the tank.  Your tank will still need to spike ammonia.  Feed your fish and not sparingly.  They need to eat too.<br>  <br>  Also, you had 3 fish in a new tank then added 5 fish to the same tank.  Unfortunately the new addition is what killed the fish.  You should only add 10% of the tank volume in inches of fish.  Adding 5 fish to a 29 gallon tank raises the ammonia level.  Even though you may not have caught the spike, 2-3 fish at least one week apart.  Be sure to acclimate the fish prior to releasing them.  There were simply too many fish in too new of a tank.<br>  <br>  Although most fish are hearty, if you continue to have problems with them dieing, you may need to find a new place to purchase fish.  Just be sure your temperature is where it needs to be for your fish, get yourself a test kit and do not trust the pet store.  I have seen them sell crap to people to FIX their water when it wasn't needed.  <br>  <br>  Stick to your 25% weekly water change keep chemicals that aren't needed (really the only one you need is the dechlor/conditioner) out of the tank.  Let your tank run another week or so prior to trying to add another fish.  only add 1-2 and see how that goes.  Then a week or two later you can add more.|`|dXAgTUSraa	It just depends but I think you have too many fish, I did the sane but mine wasnt nearly that big and all my fish kept dying so one day i just got one and ive had Nemo (lol) for 7 months now.

This could be a major reason for this behaviour. Rats should not be kept alone, they need the company of other rats.

Number one is making sure he has a friend, otherwise he'll get extremely bored and chew more than most rats. If he already has cage mates, be sure to provide plenty of chew type toys (wood blocks) and lots of crunchy fruit, veggies, dog food, or cereals. Rats chew for a majority of reasons, including they simply enjoy doing it (sometimes), and they need to file their teeth down. Rat's teeth never stop growing, so they need to keep them in check, they do this, generally, with the food they eat and the wooden toys we provide them with. If they are not provided with lots to chew on, they will resort to chewing on cage bars or the cage pan (if plastic).|`|df1beb28ec457339664195de5a03682caa	He is doing it to keep his teeth from getting too long.The bars of his cage are not ideal for this,but if that is all he has got to chew on then he will carry on.He's got to you see,as his teeth do not stop growing and if they get too long he will not be able to eat.Get him something to gnaw on from the pet shop.|`|ct8g0DTiaa	he does it because rats love to chew. they love it like we like chocolate or more actually.

They were very happy to come and go as they pleased. <br>  <br>  Anyhow, at about two years of age, one had an operation and we felt best to keep the cage shut until she had fully recovered. <br>  <br>  She frantically chewed at the bars day and night until we let her out. What I am trying to get at is that they need freedom, if you are not getting your rat out enough to play and keep interested, it will get bored and most certainly take it out on his/hers surrounding. If your not getting it all at all it most definitely needs to come out, if you are try some more each day. <br>  <br>  Also do you have just the one? Maybe it needs company, if you are going to introduce another rat, it needs to be done gently and gradually.<br>  <br>  If its the case also where it needs to gnaw because their teeth are constantly growing, try getting treats that will help their teeth or some wood. Wood will also help his claws.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps a little.|`|ndFUTEXlaa	<a href="http://onlyin.has.it" rel="nofollow">http://onlyin.has.it</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|xAEX7ddAaa	I think he is bored too.

The most common cause of colitis is a dog eating something that it should not have done. Animals who habitually raid the bins get colitis quite frequently. Rich foods, dairy products, or fatty foods are common culprits. Dogs may also eat litter they find in the park and subsequently get colitis. If this is the case with your dog it may help to get him used to wearing a basket type muzzle when out on walks to prevent him picking up discarded food.<br>  <br>  Sometimes colitis may be due to dietary intolerance a bit like Irritable Bowel Syndrome in humans. If this is the case then feeding an hypoallergenic diet containing a protein source which the dog has never had before (for example venison or rabbit), may be beneficial. The most likely dietary sensitivities are dairy products, wheat and beef. A dog may develop sensitivities to its diet and such dietary intolerance may be permanent or temporary.<br>  Stress can also cause colitis especially if the animal has a nervous disposition. Hence dogs will often develop signs of colitis when they stay in kennels.<br>  <br>  Another cause of colitis is undigested food managing to reach the colon either due to problems with the digestion or hypermotility of the bowels resulting in an increased transit time of food through the gut. Signs of colitis are seen when there is a bacterial overgrowth in the gut (often with Clostridia), other infectious causes of colitis include Salmonella spp, Campylobacter spp, Giardia and E coli amongst others and this highlights the need for good hygiene when dealing with dogs with diarrhoea. Rare causes of colitis are foreign bodies and abrasive material in the gut, chronic pancreatitis, neoplasia (cancer), polyps, and various inflammatory disorders.<br>  There is a form of colitis called histiocytic ulcerative colitis and young boxers are the dogs most predominantly affected by this.<br>  <br>  Treatment of colitis should begin by starving the dog for 24- 48 hours initially (make sure fresh, clean drinking water is available; your dog will probably need more water than normal) After 24- 48 hours introduce a bland diet: chicken or white fish with rice or pasta is often used. Cook this food plainly with no oils or other extras. When symptoms of colitis resolve gradually introduce the normal diet increasing the amount given a little every day for about a week until the dog's diet is completely back to normal.<br>  <br>  If you find that your dog cannot tolerate its normal diet any longer and symptoms recur then you may need to feed the blander type of diet permanently. You can do this by continuing with something such as the chicken and rice (although you may need to supplement this with vitamins and minerals), or if you would prefer a preparatory diet these are available on prescription from your vet. Hills do a very good range of such diets and your vet will probably find one to suit your pet. Hills w/d and d/d are the ones most often prescribed. These diets work by being hypoallergenic (d/d) or by increasing the fiber content of the diet (w/d) which increases the bulk of faeces and helps to bind water reducing the symptoms of diarrhoea.<br>  <br>  Sometimes dietary management is not enough to control the colitis. In these cases treatment with antibiotics and / or corticosteroids is necessary. Sulfasalazine is a useful treatment for dogs with chronic colitis and treatment may be required for 2 -6 weeks (Your vet will want to monitor your dog for signs of "dry eye" while on this drug). Motility modifiers may also be used but these only treat the symptoms not the underlying disease. There are also complimentary therapies available for this condition. To prevent this problem in dogs prone to colitis never change their diet abruptly but introduce new foods gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks. As a general rule it is a good idea to worm your dog every 3 months.|`|AA11097657	Colitis can be an on going problem throughout the dogs life.<br>  Some dogs are just prone to it.<br>  You just have to manage it with high quality food and take action at the first sign by starving for 12 hours.<br>  The stomach will need to rest and recover.<br>  <br>  Then feed chicken and rice for a day or two. 4 small meals are better than one large one.<br>  <br>  If you are in the UK, Burns dog food is excellent for dogs with colitis. My shelties haven't suffered from it for years since switching to Burns.|`|2Upd7ev6aa	I made a list of things you could do, and some facts<br>  <br>  #  In dogs with chronic colitis, dietary modification using hypoallergenic diets may be tried. Using a home-prepared or commercial diet that contains a "novel" protein source (one which the dog has not previously encountered) sometimes is sufficient to control the colitis and eliminates the need for further medical treatment. No food items except for the "hypoallergenic" diet should be fed to affected dogs during this trial period of treatment. Dogs that respond to this approach are thought to have a food allergy that is manifested as colitis.<br>  <br>  # Fiber supplementation (either by adding fiber to the dog's normal diet or choosing a diet that is naturally high in fiber) sometimes is of great benefit to dogs with colitis.<br>  <br>  # Anti-parasitic (deworming products, anti-protozoal drugs) treatment is indicated in colitis to eliminate the possibility of parasites that are intermittently shed in the stool (whipworms, Giardia). Parasites are a leading causes of colitis, and this approach is routinely done as a first step in the management of colitis.<br>  <br>  # Antibiotic treatment can play an important role in the management of colitis. Although useful when a bacterial cause of colitis has been identified, antibiotics are sometimes useful even when a bacterial cause of colitis has not been established. Three anti-microbial agents commonly used in this situation are metronidazole, sulfasalazine and tylosin. These drugs have been used successfully as single agents, in combination with one other, or in combination with other drugs.<br>  <br>  # Anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs (drugs that suppress the immune system) such as cortisone-like drugs (corticosteroids) and the immunosuppressive agent azathioprine generally are reserved for dogs in which colitis is strongly suspected to be immune-mediated in nature based on microscopic examination of biopsy specimens obtained during colonoscopy. These drugs have potential adverse effects and only should be used under close veterinary guidance with regularly scheduled re-evaluations. These drugs are invaluable and extremely effective when used appropriately.<br>  <br>  # Motility-modifying drugs (drugs that effect the motor activity of the intestinal tract) most often are used for symptomatic relief rather than for long-term medical management of colitis.|`|XOmZoc5Naa	probably she eat something that was spoil or infected.

SmlzU8O1aa	Okay, firstly, you have to decide whether the dog is still happy. When the urination stage comes on, the dog can get very unhappy. It is sometimes time to put the dogs happiness over your own wishes for him to still be here.<br>  <br>  Firstly, I want to warn you that once the urination stage comes on, the control of excrement goes next, and then there is not much time. My old dog started urinating herself October last year. She was dead by November 24th. It was a natural death, she was 15 and very old and decrepit. Start treating your dog with as much love as you can give him, make him feel safe as now he will begin to get very frail and he knows it. He needs to know he is safe with you.<br>  <br>  I think training diapers are for both sexes, so that might be a good idea. Get one that can hold faeces, as that too is about to follow (from personal experience anyway).<br>  <br>  For the love of god, please do not lock him in a room. I had a friend with an elderly dog that locked iher in a room when she got old. THey fed her twice a day by pushing a bowl through the crack in the door when they opened it.

But did you let yourself say Goodbye? I know from personal experience that being able to say goodbye is the start of the healing process. Your dog is not mad or angry with you. He is not in pain any more and if he could talk I'm sure he would tell you the same thing. They say that death is a part of life.

Dogs don't hold grudges, and live for today.  They don't know what's coming up next, but you did - you knew this could happen again, and probably would.<br>  <br>    Do not dwell on it, but go on to something productive - you were very brave and took care of what could have been a problem that would only have gotten worse.  Many dogs that behave badly are beaten after they bite or attack someone - instead, yours was humanely euthanized.  He was also not alone.  That is the best gift your can give a dog you care about, but that is destined for bad things.  You kept him, and others around him, from suffering any further.  And that, my dear, is an heroic gift.<br>  <br>    While it's hard to have happy memories of a dog that has gotten into trouble, I hope you can allow yourself the peace of knowing you did what had to be done, to save him from abuse.  He is at peace, and now it is your turn.|`|HHLirlotaa	You will be okay.I had a pitbull/lab retriever and he bit my little brother who is 7 years old. I was also in the room when they had put him to sleep. I didn't know what to do or say. I didn't really cry because i was to hurt to cry. I got another dog after that and then i really didn't spend anytime with that dog because i was to hurt to look at another dog. I loved my first dog with all my heart that was my baby. I really hope you can get over the fact that  he is gone and move on. Yes  the feelings wil go away but you will still will hurt a little bit. good luck!|`|SmlzU8O1aa	That feeling will pass with time, but you will always miss him. It is not your fault that he had to be put down - remember that. It was no-ones fault. Dont worry about not looking at the other dogs, that will pass too.<br>  <br>  Once I saw a dog strangled to death with a rope infront of me, and i couldnt look at my dog without crying for a week. Remember though, the other 2 will be upset at his death too, and you will all be in this together. They will look to you for what to do at this time.<br>  <br>  ~LordB~|`|fc5e4f4741642787d64f7d84cccb7b94aa	Time will help make this awful feeling fade.  You did the right thing by staying in the room with him so his final moments were not without someone he loved. <br>  Dogs and cats are just as much family members as people to many and this hurts just as much.<br>  I would try to enjoy the other dogs since at this point they might be missing you.  You are there but not there right now for them.  If something terrible was to happen soon to them it's hard to believe but you would feel even worse since you are having a hard time being there owner right now.  <br>  Maybe you should do a memorial for you dog that past and try to shut out the vets office.  Talk about him but only positive things.  Cry, it's okay.  The hurt is very raw right now. Hold one of the other dogs while you do it.  This might help.<br>  I lost one 3 weeks ago and I have two others also.  It can help if you try to connect more with them at this time.<br>  Good luck and remember time heals.<br>  Kath|`|m9eSPvdfaa	My dog of 14 years laid down one night behind my car. I didn't know she was there and I accidently ran over her. I hurt her very badly and had her put to sleep. Not only did I make the decision to mercifully end her life, but i'm also the one who caused her so much pain. I thought I'd never be able to forgive myself and was so depressed and guilt-stricken I didn't know what to do with myself. To me, it was almost like losing a child. That was 4 years ago. Altho when I think of her I always re-live what I did to her but it doesn't devastate me like it used to. I have many many many happy memories of her. It will get better for you. Everyday will help you heal and eventually you will be able to cope with the loss. Give it time and don't be afraid to LET yourself mourn your friend. I promise he doesn't think you're cruel and he wasn't wondering how could you do such a thing. He took comfort in knowing you never left his side.
1c6TmvrZaa	I have not heard of riding across an actual country, but my church does a ride every year called The Ride For Life. It benefits the Lighthouse Pregnancy Center and all the money that is raised by it goes to that organization for mothers who are financially troubled and cant pay for the things they need for their baby. Last year it was just a short 4 day ride, but this year we will be riding from Salida CO cross-country to Taos New Mexico. It is going to be a 14 day ride and we are hoping that we will raise at least $50,000 for them. It is a great cause and the fact that it is charity makes it even better. Riding horses to help other people, what gets better than that?<br>  If you are looking into something like this, I would suggest asking around where you live to see if there is anything locally, and if not try googling it for a national ride that might be happening. You never know. Good luck and I hope that you find something good :)|`|IJoM4Q50aa	My kids 4-H club did a St. Jude ride every year and did a great job of raising money.<br>  (Trail ride)|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	hmm I havn't but when I am old enough i will definitely consider it.<br>  google it, maybe... My internet is being slow, I'm sorry, I can't show you websites.|`|gbd4PMwfaa	I know of a horse show every year called youth Charity in Springfield where all proceeds go to a chosen Charity. I haven't competed yet but am hoping too this year.

FdcWPp48aa	You don't have to get the tests done, but if you do it will help you know the health of your dog and you will be able to better care for her in the future.  However, if you choose not to, and she comes up lame later, you won't know what's wrong and may have to have her tested any way.<br>  <br>  If you get her hips checked and find that they are bad, there are supplements that you can start now that can help her as she ages, like glucosamine and chondroitin.  I don't know the doses, talk to your vet if you feel a need to supplement your dog.  <br>  <br>  BTW - I have a Rottweiler that we all know are prone to bad hips, I have not had her hips checked but plan to in the future and no, I have no plans to breed her.  I will have the eyes checked to.  If for nothing else, it will give my breeder information on how her litters are healthwise.  I'm not really sure why breeders don't require testing of the offspring so they can monitor the health of thier lines.|`|4zp6Uz2Haa	A Vet can look at the radiographs and possibly find any areas that may cause her problems in the future.  The only thing you can do is supplement her with Omega 3, 6, and 9 fatty acids.  And a glucosamine chondrotin...(sp? not too sure on that one)  This will help her joints stay healthy longer.  From the Omegas she'll also have a beautiful coat.  If you aren't going to show or breed her I wouldn't worry about having these tests done I would just start to supplement her which is what any large breed owner should do anyway just to lessen normal wear and tear on the joints.  Just keep an eye on her and at the first signs of any discomfort then test her.  She'll probably be fine for years.  You can also return to your breeder and find out if either the ***** or sire have had any displasia problems.|`|eDySIDPQaa	We have 9 breeders in our dog club, they all show, and even with their pups they do not show, they do all the testing, even if they are to spayed or neutered......every single one does all the testing on them....<br>  <br>  I think it's worth it, and yes it does prepare you for the future of the dogs health...gets you ready if onset is early, and you are not surprised with any medical bills to come out of it.<br>  <br>  Yes, I would do all the testing early on.........I have done all for Bo and Koda, since being giant breeds...even for pets, yes I would still do it...|`|sMBuotwZaa	I have wondered about this as well.  And wondered if I should have my dogs checked when they hit 2.<br>  <br>  I think if you have a dog of questionable origin (Shelter, rescue, poor breeder) It might not be a bad Idea to have their hips and eyes checked to let you know what you might face down the road. That way you may know if there is any way you handle the dog now, and it gives you time to start tucking away an emergency fund in the need to major vet care, surgeries, or medications for pain and discomfort. <br>  <br>  Its seriously crossed my mind to have this done with our Mix, who is a Boxer/Greyhound mix.  Just because we don't know what she had thrown into her genetically good or bad. We have hip, eye, and elbow scored on both of our Aussies parents and they all had good scores so we will watch him, and maybe have his hips checked.<br>  We will definitely have his eyes monitored, because he had an odd shaped pupil in one eye, it has no ill effect on his sight, but its best to monitor it.<br>  <br>  Do what you think is best.  The comfort of knowing either way may be enough. It will let you know what to prepare for if need be or give you a peace of mind.|`|sRcKPzQ0aa	Hii, i think that its in the best interest for your dog to get these done, its best to be prepared for things in the future than to be thrown in at the deep end. <br>  I wish i had the chance to get my GSD hip scored because he now has arthritis and its difficult getting him comfortable in cold weather, knowing sooner something could have been done. Also i know of other people in the same situation. You will feel better if this happens knowing you did what you could rather than having the opportunity to do so and not acting upon it. <br>  I would have it done, :-)|`|AA10029366	My opinion...<br>  <br>  The incidence of hip dysplasia in the breed is about 2% (in the USA...I would expect similar results elsewhere). If you have no plans to breed your girl, I really don't see the point in doing it. It is unlikely that she will have HD, so this would be for your peace of mind only...and not worth the cost, IMO, since it won't change anything if she is affected down the road. It will just give you a heads-up.<br>  <br>  I have done eyes on dogs I've sold as pets, and dogs I've never bred. Eye disease is more significant in the breed, and I like to know that *every* dog in the litter I bred is clear...not just the parents and the puppy I kept. This is something I ask my pet owners to do, especially if I know of a risk in the bloodlines.<br>  <br>  So it might matter to your breeder, even if it isn't particularly significant to you.<br>  <br>  In order to be useful, eye clearances really need to be done annually until the dog is 5 years old...a dog may be clear at 8 months, but when re-checked at 2 years or 3 years old, the same dog may have developed juvenile cataracts.<br>  <br>  So, again, it's up to you...however, if you do check her eyes, I'd plan to do it annually.|`|JM4Uiunqaa	I can understand her testing non-breeding dogs: it lets her keep very good track of what she is producing in her breeding program even outside the show ring, which is very commendable and shows a thorough commitment to the health of the breed. And just because a dog is a champion, does not mean it is automatically breeding quality. Dogs can, and do with a fair amount of regularity, champion before the age of 2, but hips can only be reliably scored after 2. So you could pretty easily end up with a champion with fair hips and since many breeders won't breed a dog with "fair" hips, you get a champion dog that is not of breeding quality. There are other ways a similar situation could arise, but you get the point. It really just means that she is very selective in her breeding. <br>  <br>   If you want to get your dog's hip and eye scores, that certainly wouldn't hurt. If her hips aren't very good, it is possible to prevent or lessen problems by (gently) building muscle on the hips and supplementing with things like glucosamine and chondroiton. It would also help to know so you know how close an eye to keep on her weight. Not that you would let her get fat, but if her hips are bad, it's  important that she not be allowed to carry any more weight than is necessary, even for just a little while. If she came from a good breeder, you probably don't have much to worry about really.

MstjbpVJaa	What is happening to your birds to cause this Scruffiness to their tails,is not their diet,(I have bred hundreds) they have been startled (disturbed when sleeping) at some time in their Aviary and are clinging to the wires,they spread their tails thus damaging their tail feathers.<br>  <br>  Something has or is frightening or startling them causing them to land heavily on their aviary wires,they then spread out their tails at the moment of landing thus causing the damage.(Have a Mice or Rat infestation,this can startle them at night.)<br>  <br>  That's the easiest way I can explain,try letting them bathe they will then preen their feathers back into condition.<br>  <br>  Another factor could be are they nesting,have they young,they could be clinging onto the front of their nest box,or overcrowding in the nest.<br>  That is assuming they are nesting.|`|qeOlkRM0aa	Your cage may be too small. That is a common problem with new bird owners. Another possibility may be that they are very young birds, which tend to bash up their tail feathers. Its hard to tell over the internet.

84558de0349fa374ed3605ac33e8e36daa	Mine isn't a mix. She is a pure aussie (supposedly). This breed is very full of energy. Remember they are herding dogs, so they are meant to work. So a walk up and down the street won't do it. Be sure you are able to provide lots of time and exercise to your dog. If they get bored they can be pretty frustrating because they will find something to entertain themselves which can result into destroying your shoes, clothes, furniture etc. <br>  But aussies are definitely worth every second of time and every piece of love you put in them. They are loyal, affectionate, and very smart. My aussie knows quite a few tricks and she was so easy to train. She is almost asking to learn all these tricks. I don't know very much about labs but I think they are very smart too and extremely loyal. <br>  My dog is kinda small for an aussie. She is fully grown and only reaches about one or two inches over my knees (measuring from her back) and she is 40lb.<br>  Good luck and lots of fun with your new dog!! :o)|`|1XLZdOcQaa	This is really a good choice.

You should know within a few pounds how big the dog will be as an adult.  Have you ever seen a 3 month old mastiff or great dane?

10z4YDd7aa	This is an age old question and I dont think it can be answered easily.<br>  <br>  Lots of reasons for the decline of songbirds are given here, and they are all correct!<br>  <br>  Environmental changes are of course at the top of the list, and cats actually account for a horrendous amount of wildlife deaths.<br>  <br>  Corvids always attract bad press over songbirds as does the sparrowhawk. But you have to look at the predator prey cycle. If you have plenty of predators, it means you have strong prey numbers, because if there weren't, you wouldnt have the predators that need them to exist.<br>  Also, the corvids dont need songbirds to exist. They are able to survive ion so many sources of food.<br>  If we were to take the example of the magpie as being a major destructive force of these songbirds, then we would also have to consider the eradication of all mustelids (weasel, stoat, pine marten), hedgehogs (yes they eat the eggs of ground nesting birds!), snakes, rats, mice, squirrels etc. I think maybe you get my point.<br>  <br>  On a practical point, a few years ago, I put up ten nest boxes for small birds in the same village. The typical supposed culprits were all in abundance, Jay's Magpie, Sparrowhawks, Squirrels and Kestrels.<br>  The first year, I got two pairs of great ****. 3 years later, ALL boxes were full of great ****. <br>  I would like to think that this helps show that birds need habitat more than they need their predators culling.|`|vwC7klVVaa	No it isn't . I don't believe the decline in song birds is the magpies fault it more to do with humans we destroy the countryside ,use pesticides etc . The decline in all are native birds and animals is due to humans just because one bird or animal  adapts well we blame it for the decline of others.|`|MstjbpVJaa	As much as I would like to see them culled,only the Government(or those authorised)or Landowners,are allowed to kill these Pests.<br>  If they are causing Damage to Their livestock or Game bird breeders.|`|jyGTlpzTaa	One of the biggest threat to the native songbird population is pet cats. Should we be culling them too?|`|rQlzfHqraa	Pets should never be let free outdoors as they are not the predators native species evolved with. There's a lot of truth in the answers here but all things must be considered.  If we change only one thing we haven't done much. We need to correct all the problems that we've caused. Removing the European starlings and English sparrows would allow native species the space they enjoyed before these foreigners arrived. We tend to screw up more than we fix.|`|ur5wDhkMaa	Magpies are at the top of the food chain, would it not make more sense to to stop using chemicals and restore native habitat, before killing anything.<br>  <br>  Retrospective action against a species because of mans mismanagement of the environment isn't going to save a generation of songbirds.
SHahkZWOaa	I think you should take your dog to the vet, to confirm that he has blocked anal glands. Our dog had this and there farts used to stink like Satan's toilet. The vet has to stick his finger up your dogs butt, to get rid of all this black stuff that's inside, it's gross, what a job.. But it's worth it for the dog, some dogs just get it all the time, and my boyfriend.|`|01d4fd76ed5b517f49a55ea0f996488faa	Visit a veterinarian.

My present dog had dreadful problems because of the food which I gave her, I experimented with dog food, I tried raw diets, cooked diets and over the years I tried various dog foods. She did not like the raw diets and the dog food that I gave her resulted in diarrhoea. As an experienced dog owner I introduced any changes gradually. Nevertheless my dog still had problems. She was eight years old before I resolved her problem. <br>  Eventually, because of my researches on the Internet I found that the experts have discovered that GRAIN in our dog’s diet causes many problems. I now know that grain creates acidity in the blood. This causes skin problems, digestive issues, allergies, sickness, diarrhoea, anal gland problems etc., <br>  <br>  if your dog has skin problems or any of the above problems PLEASE CHANGE THE DIET. Avoid Grain, rice, beef derivatives and dairy food <br>  <br>  I now give my dog a dried food which uses beet for fibre and fish. It’s called Fish4Dogs and I buy it on the Internet. Look on the Internet and investigate yourself. Gluten free dog food is not enough to help our dogs, it MUST BE GRAIN FREE.<br>  <br>  A rapid change of diet will upset your dog; any change of diet must be done gradually. Do please change to a grain free diet. I have had sixteen dogs throughout the years and they have had various problems.

MKdR8MIUaa	Hi, My name is Tucker and I'm an Australian Shepherd.  When I was 10 months old, we took a trip across the country.  We drove from Vermont to California, and then my Dad rode his bicycle all the way to Maine.  We were gone for 8 weeks.  So I know about car trips.  Most important - for your safety and your puppy's - have him confined in the car.  Use either a crate or a dog seat belt  and harness.  The next most important thing - always keep him on a leash when outside the car.   Things to take - a little food for treats (no food for a couple of hours before leaving); water; a familiar blanket and toy;clean up supplies in case of accident (he is a baby and you might not be able to stop exactly when he needs to).  You should also get a health certificate from a vet.  On my website below, in TIPS, we've listed a lot of information about traveling with your dog. The second site is my blog - there are more tips there as well.  Safe travel!|`|jZGg0gNKaa	Whenever we do road trips we look up dog parks that are along the way home (if your little guys is dog friendly.) This way it keeps them from being restless in the truck. If he's not dog friendly most parks allow dogs with a leash so a good long walk every so often works as well. Also don't forget the dogs have to have pit stops too now (especially since you have a puppy), pull over every couple hours to let him relieve himself and keep fresh water in the car but make him drink it slowly so he won't have to pee right away. Kongs are a good "keep you busy" kind of toy filled with a tasty treat.|`|rpVQpJA7aa	Since he is so young, I would be taking a quick stop every 2 hours otherwise he might have an accident. Make sure you give him the opportunity to have a drink of water each time, and be feeding him 2x within those 23 hrs. Take some toys such as chewy bones and kongs, and a soft fleece blanket for when he wants a nap|`|z2TjjnxVaa	You can get them a kong to keep them busy. <br>  <br>  One of the best things to stuff it with is peanut butter and then freeze it. This will last quite awhile. Or cheese whiz. <br>  <br>  I would stop probably every 4-5 hours or so. It depends on their bladder activity now, and then just judge by that.|`|xEI1e5jDaa	keep the window glasses half open so that the car is well ventilated,do not forget to carry water and a container,a littleb pedigree can be handy as well. i suggest you dedicate the full back seat of your car to him so that he has plenty freedom. keep a check on his panting and the amount of moisture around his nose. this will indicate the comfort level of your dog. dont let it get dry or dripping. in either case take a break make him get down the car along with you for a while give him water and he will be fine. also do let him urinate from time to time.|`|VPmHIvtJaa	Since the journey is a long one, bring a couple of towels and a bottle of water, just incase the dog gets sick.<br>  And try not to feed him before the journey?<br>  I know it sounds mean not to feed it for the whole day, but just a couple of snacks to keep it going will be fine.<br>  Make sure there's lots of wind or it's well ventalated.<br>  Having music on is fine, just make sure it's not overly loud, as this can stress your dog out, especially in a small environment.<br>  If you will allow it, a chew toy or bone will keep the dog occupied for a bit, but to be honest, it'll just go to sleep after a while.<br>  Keep an eye on it, and let the dog out every 4-5 hours, for a pee and what not.<br>  Like you normally would at home. (:<br>  <br>  x|`|9KdgS2Ymaa	She will probably have to go potty every 2-3 hours. Pups cant hold it for too long till they are trained. Probably not potty trained so she can't tell you when. Try minimal feeding so she wont have to go as much.  Actually you can go the whole trip and not feed her at all they are fine to not eat for a day or two. Up to you.  Maybe put a towl across her area and bring some extra. Maybe bring some cleaning supplies or sprays. I would recommend a crate with a towel. Plus crates are good for future trips. My dog goes in the crate and can hold it for 8 or more hours. Bring plenty of water and if its hot let her get air so put the window down some. Rub water on her chest if she gets real hot. If its cold make sure shes warm. Everytime you stop just bring her out and let her run around. The more tired you get her each time you stop the easier the trip will be. Shes so small just give her some toys to goof with. Give her lots of love and praise when she is relaxing and sleeping and going things you want.  Good Luck|`|lndaCQmGaa	<a href="http://inall.lovez.it" rel="nofollow">http://inall.lovez.it</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|kd9kWB8Kaa	have a crate or cage for him to ride in.  favorite toy inside.<br>  have all his paperwork of shots.<br>  have a water bowl and food.<br>  have a leash on him before opening door.<br>  stop every couple of hours or when he wakes from sleeping.<br>  don't take him out of crate when he whines or you will teach him to whine.<br>  have a safe trip|`|UvhfYAHuaa	I can totally help here. What you want to do is 6-12 hours before you leave take away his food. Normally the night before if you plan on leaving in the morning. Don't worry he'll be ok. About an hour or 2 before you leave take away his water and make sure he's used the bathroom a couple times before you leave. Some items to take for him for the trip would be his blanket or towel (all puppies have one normally) some of his toys especially one he can chew on. Take a little bowel for water (bottled water at room temp is best)  Give only enough water to "wet his whistle" so to speak. He'll want to gulp the water down but try to make him go slow.Take treats for him for food wise and only give him a couple at time. Best time to do this is when you stop to walk him at a rest stop.  That way if they are salty or dry the water will keep him happy.  Taking away his food the night before should keep him from getting sick. However if you want to make sure he won't call a local vet and ask about motion sickness pills for pets. Most of the time a child's dose won't hurt a pet but I'm not a vet and I would not tell you to take my word alone on that especially given that your dog is a little dog to begin with. Just bare in mind that you are in a since traveling with a young child. I hope I've given you some good ideas and advice :)
342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	If it was me I'd certainly be telling her exactly what I thought.  Yes, it's too late for this dog but what if this ignorant person gets another dog?  Someone this clueless needs to be tuned in before she kills another animal for something that's her fault.|`|b4NcFBhraa	She shouldn't have been so irresponsible and she should have known that dogs, being predators, and larger than cats, is bound to eat an easy fresh and organic meal of kitty litter.<br>  I'd tell her it's wrong, show her all the answers you got (the majority that said it's HER fault) and hopefully she'll change her mind. You can't expect a dog to just KNOW not to eat kittens. SHe should have CONFINED the KITTENS and the dog. IT's not safe to let new kittens play with a natural predator. Hope this helps :D|`|AA10283080	That was the owners fault and the owner should be euthanized before the dog.<br>  <br>  I would tell her in the nicest way that indeed it was not the dogs fault for being and acting like a dog and that if she has other dogs or gets another dog in the future she should use her common sense and not leave a dog alone with kittens.|`|9kTejB0uaa	Depends how much of a friend this person actually is as to whether you tell her what you truly think.<br>  <br>  Obviously going by the bald facts as stated, it would seem that too much was being asked of this poor dog to allow him access to this mum and her kittens.  However, (I'm a Libra so do try to see the balanced viewpoint lol), might there be more to the reason she opted to euth. for this episode?  Something else that's gone on with this dog that you don't know about and this was just the final straw?  Probably not, but it's worth throwing out the suggestion.  And I would also say that vets don't normally like putting healthy dogs down!!<br>  <br>  If it was a 'friend' of mine, and if you are having to deal with her feelings of guilt now, I think I'd have to tell her that you can't sympathise with her, that it was her decision, and what's done, is done.  <br>  <br>  It is possible she could get another dog - and that's the point I'd be exploding (if there truly isn't more to this story).|`|YV1bOajXaa	It sounds like she was looking for an excuse to get rid of the dog.  Who in their right mind would leave kittens within reach of a dog?  The cat and kittens should have been in a locked room while she was out.  It was her fault this happened, not the poor dog.  There are mother animals that eat their own young, so it is not unheard of.  And after it happened the first time she didn't learn anything and let it happen again?  I don't think your friend is too bright.  <br>  I would not fake sympathy towards her.  I would tell her exactly what I thought.|`|d5781f30069ecf14d7c481d2dc40aec7aa	I would tell her what I thought. Considering the circumstances it is doubtful that the dog would be a real threat to other animals and the chances of the dog being a threat to people is nil (since newborn kittens look and sound rather like squeak toys) A responsible owner who is truly concerned for her pet and the safety of other animals would have looked into re-homing the dog into a single pet home ... not put the dog down. What she did was disgusting.<br>  <br>  Late edit: shadowtalker1 has no idea what she is talking about with the "taste of blood" thing. That is absolutely an old wives tale. If it was true then every dog who was given a bit of raw beef would be a killer.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	I would never euthanize a dog for that reason and yes, she's the one at fault, not the dog.  And the dog had prey drive toward cats - which is no indication whatsoever of how a dog will behave around humans.  I'm amazed she found a vet who would do it.  None of the vets I know would euthanize for that reason.|`|YW74O9aNaa	oh... thats sad. If it just happened once i would try to understand .. but she left the dog free again for him to eat the third kitten! How irresponsible is that!<br>  And anyways, she should've just opted to give the dog away. <br>  To put him down was a bad decision i guess. <br>  I would tell her my honest opinion. What if she gets another dog after a few days !|`|AA12114850	Of course it wasn't a legitimate reason to euthanize that dog.  Some dogs will never lose their instinctive behavior.  I think it is akin to killing a bear for attacking a human.  We are intruding in their territory after all.|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	I think you should tell her exactly what she needs to hear...the truth.  Why?  Because that woman has absolutely no business owning animals.  At least until she gets educated on the topic.<br>  <br>  And no, she didn't do the right thing.  Not even close.|`|bfe89b40e0344af279288338e469b235aa	sorry I can't give support, I can hardly look at you....|`|5rfnEQnGaa	I agree that it was not the dog's fault. The kittens should have been isolated away from the dog.|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	I'm with you, Walking Lady and Bozema - you need to have a serious talk with her about animal behaviour and what really constitues a dangerous dog.  Kittens or baby bunnies - tiny animals like that are food to many dogs, and that only makes them dogs - not a hazard unless you are a kitten that belongs to an uniformed person.<br>  <br>   I am also shocked that any vet would put this dog down.  That itself is a bigger tragedy, that they wouldn't hold up higher standards.  I have to wonder wat story they were told.<br>  <br>    You cannot cover this up, nor should you - tell her what's what, and let her deal with what she has done in its entirety.  Any dog in her sights deserves at least that.  No doubt your freindship will be forever altered by this, but it was not your doing, and whatever happens as a reult would have happened anyway.  You need to say your peace.|`|aZi6BvBraa	Tell her how you feel. I think you are right, she was responsible for the kittens. And after he killed two of them, she left them together AGAIN!!<br>  Whats next, if her cat eats a bird, will she put it down as well?|`|faPKwClPaa	It's not the dog's fault, but the truth of the matter is, once animals (not just dogs) get a taste of/for blood, there's really no turning back.  <br>  <br>  After something like that, I'd never trust that dog around my children or myself for that matter.<br>  <br>  This is hard either way.  I'm an animal lover and I hate to see animals being put down for 'convenience' reasons, but I think your friend made the right choice here.<br>  <br>  However, she needs to be more careful in the future and not let situations like this occur.  She could also benefit from dog training courses or learning more about dog behavior.
I68m0kCraa	You're kidding right?<br>  <br>  Please tell me you're kidding....
5xQESoC4aa	You have to mix up the times, my cat did that ALL the time. I just started to give the food at random times, I think she likes the surprise of not knowing when she gets to eat. lol.|`|R4k613CEaa	You can try buying cat treats, and give her a few through out the day. If you smell that pot roast cooking all day, on an empty stomach, you cant stay out of the oven, but if you have a snack, youre okay till the roast is done, right!! She may just need to be fed 2 small meals a day instead of one time a day. Try feeding in the morning & evening, just smaller amounts each time.|`|6be65543422b4937c27d1761a2ed50a0aa	As long as you don't have food out for her to "nibble" on during the day, she's going to want to eat WHEN SHE'S HUNGRY!!<br>  <br>  If your cat is a "pig", and will eat the whole bowl at one time, give her a little MEAT in the morning.......leave the bowl of dry for during the day....then give her a little more meat in the evening.  With this combination of foods, she should stop "begging" for food, because she's been able to satisfy her hunger earlier.  Cats are "grazers", and being on a "human time" schedule doesn't work for a lot of them.<br>  <br>  You don't say how old this cat is, or how long you've had him....but, kittens NEED to eat quite often during the day, because they're growing.  If this cat was a stray, he may have a "I'm not going to find food, so I have to eat everything, often" habit, and those are hard to break.  <br>  <br>  I have a "rescue" cat, who used to be like that, and would GOBBLE her food each time I gave her some.  Gradually, she realized that the food bowl would always be replenished before it was completely empty, so now she eats when she's HUNGRY, and NOT all the time!<br>  <br>  So........give this suggestion a TRY, and see if it stops the nagging..<br>  Good luck.|`|AA10859773	Two things:  Don't EVER give in, and try to distract her.  Ok 3 things - ignore her.
DtkLsetkaa	You sound like someone who really loved their cat!!!  I would definitely get another one, that would be a very lucky animal.  Getting to know and love a new cat may really help you get over your lost animal, and having someone new to exert all that energy on will be really good for you.  Good luck :)|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	never should have let her outside.  don't compare other cats to her, they will never live up to her, if you want another cat accept that cat as that cat.|`|AA11589437	You won't betray her if you save another kitty. She would want you to rescue an orphaned kitty from a shelter. The new kitty will be grateful and you will also love it. It won't be the same, and you won't be replacing her, because every cat has a different personality. Not better or worse, just different. You will develop a different relationship with a different cat. And put a name tag with your phone on her this time.|`|9440e28b2ef820fd5eab4d5cfc34217faa	My deepest sympathies.<br>  <br>  It really is time for you to get on with your life. Don't try to replace her, though: You won't find another cat in the world like her. But you can open your home and heart to another cat who needs a place to live.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|v4Wi0OJgaa	get another cat. they're all the same. meow|`|A7XV2K3Paa	I understand how you feel. But don't try to "replace" her - you can't. Each cat is an individual and needs to be treated that way. Adopt another, and love the new one for the kitty it is. Put your love into the new cat as it deserves. You will begin to heal as your new relationship grows. (from many experiences)  Realize you did the best you could for your other kitty while you could. Would also suggest keeping the new one inside, however.  Or better yet - adopt two. Two is often easier after all.|`|sgEazAn2aa	Well, that's really tough because it has to be how you feel. If you feel you want another cat and your ready go right ahead. But if you think You get another cat and every time you see it you will end up in tears don't. I lost a dog and it was misserable. about 1 year later we got another one. It reminded alot of my old dog which was good. But it never felt like she was better then the old one. so you drcide to get a new cat good luck and have a positive attitude going into the situation.
B6zl0AJDaa	If the saddle is NOT made in the UK or Europe, you're looking at probably about 50 LBS at the most.  Argentine or Indian saddles are cheaply made and normally poor quality leather (Some Argentine saddles are now made with French tanned leather.).<br>  <br>  IF it's European or UK made depending upon the manufacturer probably between 100 - 250 LBS (I can't figure out where I can find the LB key).|`|TSc8OE4vaa	It depends entirely on the brand, but I paid $250 for my new-condition 16.5 inch saddle.

86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	Salt won't do a whole lot for bacterial infections such as fin rot. I had success with Myxazin by Waterlife treating extreme cases of fin damage and fin rot in some Betta rescues in the past.<br>  <br>  The water changes are a good move, only do partial however, 100% water changes will be too stressful for the fish and will only lead to a weaker immune system in the fish. Have a go with Myxazin.|`|499ce2344d684feb00ec06bcf55edd71aa	Fin rot is usually caused by stress, usually by overcrowding or poor water quality.<br>  <br>  Betta's like to be in at least 5 gallons of water, heated to 78F. Also, you need a filter. You should never do complete water changes. Do partial changes with a gravel vac or turkey baster. Change 15% of the water weekly. <br>  <br>  If these conditions are there, then have the water tested for ammonia, nitrite and nitrate.<br>  <br>  I am sure that something I listed here will help pinpoint the cause. You need to treat the fin rot, but you also need to take care of the cause.|`|wnnudNp5aa	You should never stop treatment for a condition just because you don't see improvement immediately. Fins will not regenerate overnight! Start the treatment again, and finish it this time.<br>  Since you are new at keeping Bettas, I urge you to go to a book store, pet store, or your local library and get a book or 3 about caring for Bettas. They aren't like other fish, they are a little different. You are probably making mistakes you aren't even aware of (we all do unless we educate ourselves).<br>   With consistently proper care, your fish could live to be 5 years old, maybe even older. Without it, he probably won't make it till summer. Education is the best prevention of trouble in your fish tank. Good luck!|`|mlukX8Gtaa	do you have a heater? if not, that's probably the cause. cold water makes the fins die and start to rot.<br>  <a href="http://bettacare101.googlepages.com" rel="nofollow">http://bettacare101.googlepages.com</a>

dJs2s9pfaa	Please remove your carbon filter, if you don't your meds will be absorbed by the carbon and you'll be wasting your money. Also if your fish don't get properly treated those poor little guys will eventually get ich in their gills preventing them from absorbing oxygen and even die!<br>  <br>  The best way to treat ich:<br>  <br>  1) Raise temp to 85 F as this will speed up the Ich lifecycle, Ich can only be killed in the active phase which last only 3 days.<br>  <br>  2) 50% water change to get rid of as much eggs and free swimming parasites as possible<br>  <br>  3) 1-2tbsp of aquarium salt per 5 gallons<br>  <br>  4) Quick Cure is the best med, administer for 10 days and don't stop just because the last spot falls off. <br>  <br>  Furthermore, if you get any new fish be sure to quarantine them for up to 14 days in an unused bucket or separate tank. I use Lifeguard by Jungle Labs as a preventitive and I've had a disease free tank for 4 years now! Also be sure to start doing 25% weekly changes as the cleaner the water the healthier the fish.|`|AA11901352	you should have either a white or a blue filter pad that slides into your main filter.  More than likely this is the carbon filter, just slide it out.<br>  <br>  If you do not remove the carbon, depending on how saturated the carbon actually is, the carbon will pull the medication out of the tank and your fish will not receive the treatment.<br>  <br>  No fish stay in the tank, filter still running just without the filter pads containing carbon.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Most cartridges can be opened at the top to replace/remove carbon.<br>  <br>  Carbon filters out medication.|`|00RgkZF8aa	If you don't take it out then the carbon will absorb the ick medication, so your fish most likely won't heal.<br>  <br>  There should be a separate section in your filter for carbon.

They should be willing to help you get started...contact them for mentoring and help.<br>  <br>  First, the dog must be AKC registered in order to show in an AKC show. At your age, you can also show in Jr. Showmanship. If your Pug didn't come from a show breeder, this is probably the best place for you to begin, since they judge on how well you handle the dog, rather than judging your dog.<br>  <br>  Your best bet (if you don't have a breeder to help you) is to get in touch with your local Pug-specific club, or a local all-breed club, and find out where to attend handling classes. These will teach you how to show your dog. The handling class instructor is also a good source of information on upcoming shows, and how to enter.<br>  <br>  Links that will help you...<br>  <br>  Find a Pug Club in your area:<br>  <a href="http://www.pugs.org/clubs.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.pugs.org/clubs.htm</a><br>  <br>  Find an all-breed club in your area:<br>  <a href="http://www.barkbytes.com/sclubs/nhclub.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.barkbytes.com/sclubs/nhclub.h...</a><br>  <br>  AKC's Beginners' Guide To Dog Shows:<br>  <a href="http://www.akc.org/events/conformation/beginners.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.akc.org/events/conformation/b...</a><br>  <br>  ADD: You might also consider getting involved in a 4-H dog program in your area.

JiCKFTuIaa	Attention span is something that develops over time, no puppy is born with it.The solution is patients.|`|9kTejB0uaa	I'm going to leave it to others to give you pointers, but I just had to say you obviously bought the wrong breed.  <br>  <br>  With a Basset, it's more 'how do I get him to COME'.  Sit - stay?  Absolutely no problem whatsoever.  Basset thinking - 'Why stand if I can sit, and why sit if I can lie down'<br>  <br>  I would just suggest that at 5 months, a puppy's attention span is still quite short, so it may well take quite some time to get this sorted.  Little and often - with a 5 foot lead, start off with perfecting the sit in front, and gradually increase the distance?
h6bJ8RVoaa	well, discus and blood parrots are peaceful, so i guess there's no problem.<br>  just remember that cichlids go aggressive when its their mating time, so temporarily move them when its their period... <br>  <br>  the shark you mentioned, is it red tailed bala shark? cuz this is a territorial species. siamese algae eating sharks however are peaceful.<br>  <br>  just remember not to overcrowd your tank, i dunno, just reading how many fish species you got gives me this feeling that its crowded...<br>  hope not :)<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|eTrYM6n0aa	Don't get the Discus for your tank, they mostly belong by themselves. You can pair them with angel fish sometimes for variety  and different shapes but never with any other cichlids.Hope that helps.|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	I personally wouldn't recommend it. Discus really need tanks that cater for them primarily and any other tankmates that can cope in that environment (twice weekly water changes, peat filtration, low pH, high temp of about 82-85F). That may well rule out a lot of the fish you already have.<br>  <br>  Also, fish like those "sharks" (what kind?) may either be too active or just plain too territorial for Discus.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't base stocking solely on what someone else has done on youtube, I've seen some SHOCKING stocking "ideas" on there!!
OyNJTWaiaa	This is common when you try and breed female budgie past the age of four years. Put her in a cage next to a warm lamp of 25 to 40 watts and in the bathroom with steam happening. If she hasnt passed the egg ina  couple of hours she needs to see the vet urgently for an injection to help her expel  the egg. If, however she has been trying to push the egg out all night she will be very very ill by now and may need to go to the vet sooner. <br>  If she has sufferedf a PROLAPSE...that is some of her egglaying parts are also out with the egg...then vet care is essential NOW.<br>  This is a prolapse  <a href="http://i143.photobucket.com/albums/r145/kazzart/budgies/DSCF6953.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i143.photobucket.com/albums/r145/...</a><br>  Once she recovers...NEVER breed her again. She is too old for this.|`|EJpiaCMQaa	The only thing that may help the egg come out is humidity.  Get the shower running and put the bird in the humid bathroom.  If that doesn't work, you need to get the bird to a vet ASAP.  That means it is certainly egg bound, which is a medical emergency.|`|Rytff7alaa	your bird could just be old, all bird bleed a little. she should be able to get it out. if not, you might HAVE to take her to the vet.<br>  <br>  <br>  and if you can, make her a little nest, out of news paper or an old dish rag.
x0WZE0i4aa	Only if people are stupid enough to pay extra for a kitten of a 'desirable' colour.<br>  <br>  Really annoys me when I see kittens for sale on places like Gumtree (which is not supposed to allow commercial selling of animals...), and ginger/tortie/longhaired/pedigree cross/white kittens are priced higher.  They don't cost any more... and long haired and white (possibly deaf) kittens may well need more care.  It's bad enough selling 'I let my cat get pregnant because I don't know any better' kittens, possibly disease infected, without people making a profit out of it.<br>  <br>  I often think the selling of pet animals for profit should be banned (and I do include pedigrees in that by the way: the most responsible breeders do it for love and make little or no profit anyway).|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	domestic short hair cats are a dime 2 dozen.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Red Tabby cats are no more expesive then any other color cat.  There is a higher ratio of males to females.  The females have to have both parents being a red tabby or carrying the red color gene (like in a calico) in order to be a red female.<br>  <br>  Its just simple genetics involved :)|`|hGY08GjRaa	no.. orange tabby cats are VERY common.

84558de0349fa374ed3605ac33e8e36daa	Please adopt one. Check your local shelter or petfinder.com (as someone else already said) <br>  i just recently adopted a second dog. It was $175 and we will get $75 back once we provide the neutering records. So it was $100. Not bad. :o)<br>  The price depends on the shelter though. But I did make the experience that most shelters give money back once you have your pet fixed. (apodpted a pet in Augusta, GA, Newport News, VA and Winchester, VA and never spent more than $150)<br>   And they have a big choice of dogs that need a loving home!!|`|xNkmK0SHaa	Please consider adopting a dog from your nearest shelter.|`|EFYkci30aa	Please do not buy a dog.  Go to your local animal shelters and see what's available.  It's $80 at our local shelter to adopt and you would be saving a life.  When you buy a dog from a pet store you are contributing to the euthanization of dogs at shelters and contributing to puppy mills.  Please adopt.  :-)  Good luck.  Oh, and don't forget to get it spayed or neutered:-)|`|cY8DgJv5aa	This is not the classifieds nor is it petfinder.  If you sincerely want a pet, you need to look at what's available in your area.  Consider adoption if you aren't wanting to pay much money.  Surely you know where you local shelter or pound is.  Go right in and make your choice.  There are PLENTY of dogs to choose from.  There will be a charge of course, but most of the time it includes shots and a spay/neuter.<br>  <br>  If you are wanting a purebred, then its next to impossible to get one from a breeder for less than $200.  If you do find one selling them for cheap, its highly likely that you encountered a puppy mill and you've got a real problem on your hands.|`|89c7e5af6668337660a2665976affbf3aa	Go to a shelter near your area and find a dog you like<br>  <br>  The adoption fee at my local shelter for dogs is $125<br>  <br>  Make sure you do a ton of research before you get a puppy if you've never had one before...it will make things so much more pleasant and easier for you and the puppy. Make sure you know what you're getting yourself into.|`|J6JFiNL8aa	go to a shelter|`|vouUQQzBaa	Please think about what you are asking.<br>  <br>  A puppy for $150.  Any reputable breeder would spend a lot more than that for each puppy whelped. Food, cleaning, shots, deworming, blood tests..etc..etc..  Reputable breeders do not make money off a puppy, but they certainly couldn't afford placing at such low price, it's just impossible :( . A breeder who could place at those price would be one who does nothing for the health care of the puppy, is that what you wish for? A puppy that may come with health problems where you spend $$$$ ?<br>  <br>  Since you aren't really looking for a specific breed and/or sex, please consider adopting from a shelter near you. You'll save a life and it is around the price you wish to spend, HOWEVER do consider that a dog does need vet's visits (just like we need doc's visits) and the bills do pile up. So prior to adopting, make sure your finances are in order and you are able to support the baby throughout its life (typically a 10+ years commitment).<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|HgMFrllLaa	This is not a way to buy a dog.<br>  BTW, if husband is unwilling to pay "over 150", will he be ready to shell out cash on all vaccinations, vet care, preventatives, etc.???<br>  "Price" of the dog is always negligible compared to expenses for proper care.<br>  Nuff said.|`|qapJU3tMaa	You will not find a decent dog from a decent breeder for $150.00.

BWez86Ldaa	Nails are nails, there's really no way around that. :) Try giving her baby food, chicken, fish, veggies, fruit, yogies, etc.  I've never met a rat yet that won't take a peanutbutter yogie from my fingers! Take things slow with training. Learning her name will take a while and being hyperactive just comes with being a female rat. Litter training is basically setting up a litter box in the cage (on each level), putting some poop in there, and continously cleaning up the poop on the floor of the cage, hopefully she will get the idea.|`|XUEaEbTjaa	I hope you have more than one rat- they are social animals and do need the companionship of another rat. I haven't read any of your previous questions if you have had any so ignore me if you have more than just Ophelia.<br>  <br>  Scratches can be brutal. Some rats seem to have nails that really dig in while others are barely noticeable.  Some rat owners wipe off their rat's nails with a baby wipe before they come out to play. This helps keep any swelling down from the cut as you wiped off most of the urine on the nails that create the reaction.  You can put a brick (washed of course) under a water bottle. This helps keep the nails a bit dull.  There's a product I swear by- Wodent Wheels. These double as both a safe wheel and a nail trimmer. There is an insert you can buy for them called a Sandy Trimmer insert.  This is left in the cage for 24 hours and taken out after. The rat runs on the Sandy Trimmer insert in the Wodent Wheel and it trims their nails BEAUTIFULLY. I would never own another rat without one. These are available online.<br>  <br>  She'll eat more from you as she grows comfortable with you. Keep working with her and bonding with her. Right now it is all about building trust. Yogies are a sure fire way to get her interested in you.  Once your rat discovers Yogies, there's no going back. haha.  My husband and I joke that a Yogie is a rat's ratnip.  =)  Litter training can be done right now though. Head out and buy a ferret litter box and put it in the corner she's going in most often. Then simply put any stray poops in the litter box for about month and she should start using it. Some rats take longer than others.  I've had rats take a month and others a week.  The key seems to be to use different bedding than what is in the litter box.  I used fleece scraps as their bedding and in the litter box Yesterdays News cat litter.  Worked like a charm.  <br>  <br>  Please feel free to email me if you have any further questions.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  =)<br>  <br>  ~Yelliez|`|hC4Z8HIbaa	It's possible that you may be allergic. :( Rats nails are typically always soaked with urine because of how they are kept. When they scratch you, the urine enters your skin. Most of us get a small itching sensation because of the urine, but to itch as much as you describe is not normal and points to an allergy. Unfortunately, unless you can get to a doctor and be prescribed some allergy medicine (stuff that isn't directed at the respiratory system), there isn't a lot you can do. The only thing I can suggest is to try to find some over the counter allergy medicine and see if that helps, and to always wear long sleeve shirts when handling your rats. This will cut down on the amount of exposed skin available for scratching. If you want to try to wear her nails down, try placing a rock or brick in a high traffic area in their cage, like near their food dish or water bottle. Walking on something rough will help keep their nails from getting sharp. You could also try filing them yourself or clipping them, but you need to be careful because rats' nails have a quick like a dogs'. If you hit it, the rat will start to bleed.<br>  <br>  As for not eating things you give, I would say that is normal. Some rats will eat anything you give them, while others will only eat where they are comfortable. One of my rats will not eat while I am holding him. He has to either be in his cage or some other location where he feels safe in order to take a treat. It's just what makes him him. <br>  <br>  Training can be a very time consuming activity. In order to get your rat to respond to her name, you need to constantly use her name when you interact with her. Say her name when you pet her or pick her up, or hold her up to your face and say her name. Eventually she will understand that when you make the sound "Ophelia," it means her. It usually helps if the rat has a shorter more unique sound. For example, one of my rats has a rather long name that he does not respond to. I use a nickname when I want to get his attention, because it is short enough that he has learned it. Like calling your rat Feelie instead of Ophelia. If you want to litter train, you will need a box that is deep but not too deep and one that can't be easily tipped over. You need to place it in an area where your rat goes to the bathroom most often and put bedding in it, but it needs to be bedding that is different from the other bedding in your cage. Put some used bedding in the pan and some poop. Whenever you see the rat in the box, you must praise her, even if she hasn't done anything. You must also place any rat poops you find in the litter box. Hopefully she will eventually figure out that all her poops end up in this box, so that is where she needs to poop. Not all rats get it and most rats only ever become poop trained. It is much more difficult to pee train them. <br>  <br>  One last bit I would like to say. Please, please try to get your rat a friend. Your rat will never truely be a happy rat without a cagemate. No matter how much attention you give her, it will never equal the companionship of another rat. I understand that it's not always possible, but keep in mind that having two rats doesn't cost or require that much more time than one rat. I have included a wonderful youtube video on the subject and the link to a very useful online rat forum that I reccomend to all rat owners. Please take a few minutes to check them out.
w9aR8ymGaa	get him UTD on shots and neutered (if not already) and then charge what you paid for the vet bill or if you don't want to do those things, surrender him to a Old English Sheepdog rescue and they will take care of it for you.  Rescues will make sure that he goes to a good home who can take care of him for his whole life, not just until the next phase of their life comes into play.  <br>  <br>  If you insist on finding him a home on your own (because you want the money, whatever) please get a copy of the new owners drivers license, go see their home to make sure the dog will be safe and not used as a breeder in a mill or BYB, make sure the new owners are knowledgeable about the breed and do a vet check.  (call their vet and make sure that they take care of their past and current animals)  If an interested party is not willing to let these things happen, they are not a good dog owner.|`|aIakDSstaa	￡250, its not a puppy anymore|`|AA10029366	If you bought him from a responsible breeder, they should be willing to take him back...and then you won't have to worry about it.|`|p7swtBYzaa	I would pay whatever donation the sheepdog rescue asks - and that's where I'd go for one - rescue, don't buy.<br>  Why would you buy and encourage more breeding when there are so many dogs needing good Forever Homes.<br>  <br>  You get a great deal too - a known dog, personality assessed in a foster home, already potty trained pretty much, and spayed or neutered - can't beat that and you do some good for a homeless dog.|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	If you can't find a buyer you can take him to AHA (Animal Humane ***.).<br>  <br>  We have a military base here & when they get transferred they can't take the pets with them so they are turned over to AHA & they find homes for them.

There isn't anything wrong with loving or spoiling a pet.  These are not valid reasons to suspect someone is "doing" the dog.  Maybe your friend needs to put a stop to all the alone time his dad is spending with his dog.  Really it just sounds like the poor guy is lonely and he has become somewhat obsessive with the way he treats the dog.  I love my four dogs to the ends of the earth, but that doesn't mean I am "doing" them.  Your friend could also make it a point to just pop in on his dad unexpectedly for a while until he/she is sure there is nothing going on.  So far it seems to me that you are the one with the phobia!  Oh, and what is so wrong with buying the dog a t-shirt?  My smallest dog (3lbs-10 ounces) has several shirts, they consist of hoodies, t-shirts, and sweaters with fur collars even.  After reading what I have said about how I treat my dogs, do you think I am "doing" mine too?  I even kiss mine right on the lips!  I think you need to get your mind out of the gutter until you have proof.  Until you do leave the poor lonely man alone!  Maybe it's your hang up for one reason or another.

As far as having foil on the windows he may have a job working at nights and  like to sleep in total darkness.

I tried for about a week with a dog my neighbors abandoned (black lab mix), it wasn't pretty.

6FBpafUYaa	I have worked at 3 stores, the first one sold small animals like birds and fish, very few larger animals (cats and dogs). Once I hit Petland it was a whole different story. In terms of the larger animals one person (usually with an assistant)did all the medicating, we all had a common interest in seeing people going home with some fuzzy critter or two. My particular area was the fish department. Its a chain wide system that works very very well. They always know who is getting what and for how long. The lady that sold me my current dog and one of the 2 cats I have are from Petland, partly due to the location being closedout by a larger location nearby.<br>  <br>  Would I change anything?

We have large bins containing each animals food.<br>  ~Small pets get more chew sticks, and birds get more cuttle bone and millet.<br>  ~In the event of a leaky water bottle the wet bedding must be replaced, and also the "pee corners" need to be replaced. (You know how hamsters always use the same corner?)<br>  ~Finally everyone has to be checked to make sure they are okay.<br>  ~The entire habitats are cleaned out weekly. Birds on Monday, and small pets on Tuesday. <br>  <br>  Reptiles-<br>  ~I take a bucket to the reptiles habitat and remove all the dishes, and take them back to the sink to let them soak. (If there are tortoises they receive lettuce, with a small amount of shredded carrots, and banana) <br>  ~I take back their water dishes, a pitcher of water, a spray bottle, and two bags for dusted small and large crickets. <br>  ~Each animal is checked on to make sure they are healthy, and fed appropriate sized crickets.<br>  ~Temperature and humidity gauges are checked. Animals that require higher humidity are misted.<br>  <br>  Fish-<br>  ~The filter system has to be checked every morning to make sure that everything is working properly. Filters are replaced.<br>  ~Any deceased fish need to be removed from the system and recorded on the fish removal log. All of these numbers are submitted to the computer, and any store with high numbers are checked out.<br>  ~The fish are all fed. Tropical fish get presoaked tropical flake, goldfish get presoaked goldfish flakes. The algae eaters get algae wafers. Certain fish get fresh veggies. On Wednesdays all fish are given blood worms. On days I open I give everyone blood worms anyway. <br>  ~Algae scrubbing, ornament scrubbing, betta cleaning, gravel siphoning, are all assigned a day in the week to be completed. If you complete a task you have to initial the dry-erase board in the pump room.<br>  ~We receive more fish on Wednesday.<br>  <br>  New Arrival Room-<br>  ~Animals are quarantined for at least 14 days here when they are received by the store. <br>  ~Every morning their dishes and water bottles are soaked and replaced with fresh water and food. Basically the same as the animals on the sales floor.<br>  ~Room completely cleaned weekly, specific cages when needed.<br>  <br>  The Quiet Room-<br>  ~This is where ill, or returned animals are isolated and treated. <br>  ~Every morning their dishes must be soaked as well.<br>  ~Each animal has a pet treament log attached to a clipboard on the wall. The paper will have their cage number, store number, UPC, date isolated, date feedback form was submitted, dates taken to vet, and reason isolated. The rest of the form is for the associates to fill out twice a day. Time treated/checked, symptoms, we have to write if their condition has changed (Regressing, no change, etc.), there is a portion at the bottom reserved for the vets comments.<br>  <br>  Closing procedures include removing the salad dishes, making sure everyone has food and water, taking out the trash, and facing the store. The new arrival and quiet rooms need to be signed off on as well.<br>  <br>  ~The way my manager sees it, if we aren't helping customers then we should be cleaning. She takes advantage of my ocd. My manager is extremely knowledgable on all of the animals the stores carries, and keeps many herself. I also have an animal from each section (parrot, tree frog, leopard gecko, dogs, cats, fish), so I am very competant in answering customer concerns. I want to go into a career with animals, so I take this job seriously. My manager and I are probably the only people who are good all around, the other associates are sort of one sided. If they have issues they ask for help. <br>  <br>  What I would change-<br>  1. A better shelving system in the pump room- I was nearly squashed by a falling shelf holding deli cups and boxes. <br>  2. Better bins for the food- I think we should use containers with stronger clasps, like the ones we sell for dog/cat food. <br>  3. I would stop selling fish that don't ever sell, or shouldn't be sold at all. How many people have the room for a ten foot long tank to keep a pangasius catfish?<br>  4. I don't like where the animals come from. I know that they are certified breeders, but "mass production" and "hamster" don't belong together.<br>  5. The reptile habitats don't provide enough ventilation.|`|jyGTlpzTaa	There seems to be a bit of miscommunication in the store I work in. The animals are always fed and watered, kept clean and handled (and loved by us), but if anybody has to get anything special (eg supplements), quite often one person will forget to tell the next and the animal misses out, which is ridiculous because its a very small shop.<br>  <br>  I also hate the fact that many of the animals come from the big factory breeders who mass produce small animals that are really cruel.  They are always well cared for when they get here but I hate those big breeders. :(|`|idMpK0suaa	Used to work at PetSmart in the Pets Hotel. It was a horrible, horrible place. I hated how they were cared for. They barely seemed to care at all. And the employees were such snobs.|`|QZ3eucYWaa	The main problem with chain stores is the matter of "P&P" (policy and procedure), which is pretty much a layout of rules set by corporate in which these stores have to follow. <br>  I have worked for a big chain pet store for over 4 years now, and although I love my job and love my store, I do not love and do not agree with many of these policy and procedures that corporate has laid out for us.<br>  I just recently helped change the fact of the bearded dragons and leopard geckos being on sand - it was ironic that the bag of sand that came in for store use stated on it clearly in bold letters, "DO NOT USE ON JUVENILE REPTILES, CAN AND WILL CAUSE IMPACTION", and yet they wonder why so many of these animals were getting sick!?! This was supposedly supposed to be a nation wide change, but I have learned by walking through other stores of the same chain that this was not indeed the case =(<br>  It is hard to change things in even one store because usually the store manager is afraid of what their boss will say when they come in. If it isn't set by corporate then we cannot change it - simple as that. Matters always have to go through corporate first, and they have to be included with facts of why change should be made, not just opinions.<br>  Another thing I do not agree with for the chain I work for is their feeding of meal worms to all the reptiles (excluding snakes and tortoises). Meal worms are NOT good for reptiles as a staple, especially young ones, as they have a hard outer shell with very little meat inside making them hard to digest. It is big for the company to "push" the sell of meal worms with or without (if someone already owns a reptile) the purchase of a reptile, and I will just not do it. "Fire me!" I have proclaimed! I refuse to sell something that I know in my heart is wrong for an animal.<br>  We deep clean all animal tanks once a week, and do spot cleanings both mornings and nights. <br>  There is no perfect pet store - unfortunately. Many caresheets that pet stores hand out with animals are outdated and are based on one vet's opinion and not an accumilation of facts. And, the vet my store personally uses is very good at what he does, but he mainly handles small animals, dogs, and cats, so when we have a bird or reptile that is sick it seems in my opinion that they do not get the best care they could receive.<br>  Most of the employees I work with really do have a love for animals and follow the saying, "animals always come first". You do have the occasional person who is hired that thinks a job at a pet store is "fun", they won't have to do any work, and that it consists of playing with animals all day. These people come and go as with any company. I feel bad for customers who end up with an employee who doesn't know what they are talking about and doesn't have the want to find out the facts about an animal. No, not even I know all about every animal, but if I am faced with a question from a customer that I cannot answer for the best of the animal, I call someone over to help in the situation.

l0ktQUnWaa	You can order an extension tube where you purchased the filter. You may be able to find one that will fit at a pet store. Most filters use different diameter tubes though. You can also check at Home Depot for a piece of pvc that will fit snugly over over the tube that you have.
FQyeGsIyaa	Your kitten is not crazy.  She's a normal 4 month old and still a baby.  She's full of energy, needs a lot of attention and has a lot to learn. It's a challenge to keep up with a young kitten like this.<br>  <br>  The excessive meowing is often a plea for attention.  She wants to play and interact with you.  I know you give her attention whenever possible, but you may need to find a way to spend more time playing with her to help tire her out.  The wand toys (da Bird), laser pointers, and Cat Dancer are all good.  <br>  <br>  Don't use your hands to play with her so she doesn't think that they're another toy to go after.  When you're doing something fun with her and she tries to bite and you say no and ignore her, she'll start learning what she's allowed to do and what she can't.  She'll realize that biting makes the game stop and that's not what she wants.  <br>  <br>  A cat is awake at night, so the 5am wake up call is common.  You could either close your door at night so she can't come in and wake you up or just pick her up and put her on the floor.  After putting her on the floor every morning, my cat finally learned that she couldn't bother me until the alarm went off.  As soon as the alarm went off, she'd jump up on the bed and want to be petted. It became our morning ritual.  She was happy and I got to sleep in.<br>  <br>  A kitten younger than 6 months doesn't react to cat nip, and about 30% of cats don't react to it at all (like mine).  Please don't put lemon in the water, the acid could burn her eyes if it got in them.<br>  <br>  I put some links below about cat behavior.  When I found my kitten, I started reading everything I could, books from the library and on-line, to learn as much as I could and to help me deal with behavior problems like you're having.|`|inST4SlAaa	sounds like your family are first time cat owners.  try flicking her on the nose with your finger ONLY.  keep squirting with water.  cat nip makes them more wild.  it is like a high for them.  she is young and this is normal behavior for the kitten.  patience and training is the answer.  it is a somewhat long process. another great option is to go to the library.  when you check out books you get a different feel on finding the right answer.  find some books on training cats and cat behavior.  using both the internet and the library books work the best.   my friend called the vet and they gave her information free of charge.  her older cat was beating up her new kitten and their advice sure worked!!  if you show your parens that you are using as many resources as possible (yahoo answers, library, vet advice) they should give you the time you need.  this wont happen over night|`|K8dHqOCVaa	I feel so bad for you.  <: (  You can try to put her in one of those kitty carrier things you put your pets in, then close the door and ignore her for awhile. I know this may sound kind of crazy, but you can get another cat (An older one) Maybe she's just lonely, that's what was wrong with my cat Melody. Hope I helped.
r7ZaxU8Laa	Take her to a Vet. You're trying to diagnose a problem which could need medical attention. Most behavior problems are caused by medical problems.|`|MmRDzhaHaa	Some cats are allergic to milk, this makes their faeces runnier(lactose intolerance)so try cutting milk and anything containing it for 48 hours, to see if this makes a difference,if she is still the same after this time take her to the vet for a checkup,and make sure she has a fresh water bowl to drink to avoid dehydration.|`|cj31x3UMaa	* Cheap food<br>  * Food that she is allergic to (fish & corn are high on the list)<br>  * You cannot simply worm a cat w/out having a vet check for type of worm/parasite & getting the correct medication.

86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	We need more details, what's your tank set up?<br>  <br>  By "smell" do you mean a rotten egg smell? That's a sign of an ammonia spike which will be damaging any fish you have. In which case, do a 50% water change with dechlorinated water NOW and do some research on what species you have and tank sizes to make sure everything is right there and get a water test kit to test the parameters.|`|AA11901352	If you are talking about your tap water, smells like rotten eggs?  that is a sign there was a water break and sulpher leached into the water supply line.  If it smells like a kitty litter box, that is ammonia.<br>  <br>  Many water companies are using ammonia vs. chloramates to treat water.  You can simply call the water authority and find out if there are issues in your area.  The warm water won't "Smell" because it sits in the tank for hours allowing the smell to leach out.<br>  <br>  You can simply call the water company.  They MUST tell you what they have added to the water or if there has been a recent break in the lines.|`|AA10292406	check your nitrate and nitrite levels ,and when was the last time you made a partial water change/cleaned the filter,if more than a month(for the water change) then i suggest you do ,one last thing ,check if u have a dead fish at the bottom of the tank that u cant see.Hope this helps.
a4eca20886ed5136a1b67933a28ef01baa	Well I have 2 dogs, 1 cat, 1 turtle, 2 Cockatiels, and 5 fish and I would have to say the the two Cockatiels are my second favorite seconded by the two dogs.  They are a lot of fun to me.  I love to hold them and play with them.  Make them fly they like that too.  Right now they are both on my knees trying to get a small piece of paper towel away from each other fighting like little kids.  It all matters in the person if birds are right for you are not.  Here is some info on three different types of birds-<br>  Cockatiels need at least two hours everyday out of their cage socializing with you.<br>  Sound level low to moderate..<br>  They are smart and can learn tricks, to whistle, and some can learn to talk.<br>  The four main colors are Grey, Pied, Pearl, and Latino.<br>  A cage would run anywhere from $60- as big as you can afford, look on ebay<br>  Min. cage dimensions: 20x20x26 (larger preferred)<br>  Bar spacing: up to 1/2"<br>  The bird will range from $50-$100 different colors are more expensive. They live from 15-20 years.<br>  Good pellet diet food, Millet spray, Mineral block, Water bottle for mist baths, different perches, and Toys will be around $60-$90. Expect to spend  around $200-$250<br>  <br>  Quakers need a lot of socialization at least 2-3 hours a day out of the cage with you.<br>  Sound level is moderate to loud<br>  They are smart and with patience can learn tricks and to talk and whistle.<br>  The have one color and that is green with some light shade of other colors like white .<br>  The cage will range from $80-as big as you can afford, look on ebay.<br>  Min. cage dimensions: 24"x20"x26" (larger preferred)<br>  Bar spacing: up to 3/4"<br>  The bird is usually $150-$500 They live around 30-40 years<br>  Good diet ,Millet spray, Mineral block, Water bottle for mist baths, different perches, and Toys will be around $70-$120. Expect to spend around $350-$400<br>  <br>  Parakeets need at least two hours everyday out of their cage socializing with you.<br>  Sound level low to moderate.<br>  They are smart and can learn tricks, to whistle, and some can learn to talk.<br>  They come in a variety of colors.<br>  A cage would run anywhere from $50- as big as you can afford, look on ebay<br>  Min. cage dimensions: 18x18x20 (larger preferred)<br>  Bar spacing: up to 1/2"<br>  The bird will range from $30-$50 different colors are more expensive. They live from 10-15 years.<br>  Good pellet diet, Millet spray, Mineral block, Water bottle for mist baths, different perches, and Toys will be around $60-$90. Expect to spend around $150-$200<br>  <br>  A play gym would also be good to get you can put it on top of your birds cage and they can play with it for hours. They run anywhere from $20-$50<br>  <br>  Look for a hand-fed one that way they are already tamed and they trust people other wise if you get one from a pet store you will have to tame it yourself.<br>  <br>  Also Quakers are illegal on some states so check you state to see if it is illegal there.<br>  <br>  All birds are hard work. Make sure that you are prepared to take the time to devote to these birds. With my two Cockatiels a have to do a thorough clean once a week meaning scrubbing everything down, change the paper every other day, change the water 1-2 times a day, and change the food once a day. To have happy content Cockatiels you have to take them out all of the time. Mine spend at least 4-5 hours a day outside of their cage and I have a huge cage. Make sure that you do TONS of research. Make sure that the plants in your house aren't toxic. Did you know air fresheners and Teflon can kill them? Do your research and make sure that you are fully prepared to take on any birds.<br>  <br>  Here is a Cockatiel-<br>  <a href="http://www.butlersbirdbreeders.com/cockatiel2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.butlersbirdbreeders.com/cocka...</a><br>  <br>  Here is a Quaker-<br>  <a href="http://www.petbirdpage.com/images/quaker.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.petbirdpage.com/images/quaker...</a><br>  <br>  Here is a Parakeet-<br>  <a href="http://gfpets.com/images/Parakeet.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://gfpets.com/images/Parakeet.jpg</a>|`|qeOlkRM0aa	That depends on the individual. Some people probably think they are annoying and boring, others think they are fun. Only YOU can answer how you feel about them. Parakeets can live 20 years or so, so they are a serious commitment..|`|k3FpInRAaa	It can be really great having pet bird.  If you want a friend, then you should get a budgie, but just one!  If you get two they will only be friendly to each other.  I took my bird to university with me, and he was my friend the whole time.  If you have more than one the noise might annoy you.<br>  They should live between 9-14 years. (in my experience)<br>  have fun!|`|eo0Uv7Wsaa	I think they are a joy and every boring!

pc7ZjexJaa	buy a male.<br>  <br>  its harder for 2 females to be together than 2 males.<br>  just make sure you get them both fixed<br>  <br>  <br>  you will have a bigger chance of fights with 2 females than with 2 males|`|XKNQkwuGaa	a male is a good choice since females are more dominent with other girls. i have 3 dogs and my female rules the roost and can get pretty agressive with the boys. she is very attached to me and is my shadow and is very jealous when they come near me so i have to keep scolding her to back her off or she will snap at the males. my husky is 8 yr old and he is a laid back dog who is very good with other dogs and my little yr old poochi loves people and is friendly but my border collie has always had a jealous nature since she was a pup.males can be really agressive to so u might want to take them with u when u find another dog to see how they act around him and go from there. good luck|`|m9eSPvdfaa	I think it all depends on the dogs. If they are young like that and raised together they will be fine, male or female. I'm confused as to why you need another dog tho? Why does it matter if you have 2 or 3 or 7 dogs? Anyway, if you are established as pack leader and you avoid food aggression everyone should get along just fine. Don't forget to spay or neuter!|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	i have 3 dogs, 2 males one female, and it seems to work fine. what you need to worry about is pack dynamics not sex. you dont want to get another dog who is dominant as it can upset the structure. if you go with something submissive, you should be ok with either a male or a female.
5rfnEQnGaa	She is still a bit confused.  Make sure the puppies are warm at this stage, this is the most important. You will have to watch her closely and encourage her to stay with them until she her instincts kick in.  Try putting a little butter on the rear ends of each puppy. This should encourage her to lick them.  This is not unusual, but with care she should come round in a couple of days if you keep doing this. In the meantime, if she refuses to wash them, you will have to do this for them and you may have to find a replacement food source if all else fails. <br>  <br>  I am sure she will be fine though, and the c-section will not affect her milk production. The milk flow does take about 3 days to flow properly.<br>  <br>  ADDED: I just realised she is only a year old, so she is still a puppy herself which is another factor she is slow for her instincts to take over.  Just as well she is now spayed.|`|sUXyRlVjaa	You are going to have to hand raise these pups and that means around the clock feeding every two-three hours and stimulating the pups to pee and poop after each feeding.. Please check out this link about caring for the pups:  <a href="http://www.gashihtzu.com/orphans.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gashihtzu.com/orphans.html</a>|`|KFu7596Paa	a year old you should not have had  her bred till she was at least 2<br>  <br>  or 3 <br>  <br>  she will be fine just help her or seek Professional help|`|TSc8OE4vaa	No, it shouldn't change anything.  She is probably just confused because this is her first (and last) litter of puppies so she doesn't know what to do.  Maybe she is in pain from her surgery?  Another possibility is that because they were from a c-section she doesn't remember giving birth to them and doesn't think they are her puppies.|`|PM23RDycaa	Possibly but there is the fact she was probably going to be a bad mother regardless. You as the owners are going to have to step in here and should have been prepared for that fact. Talk to your vet.

If you suspicious of this problem I highly recommend you take your turtle into a vet immediately. Cultures are usually needed to determine the best antibiotic.|`|vS1Z0inOaa	It's really hard to say without seeing him myself...<br>     His shell seeming to be too small for him could mean that he's...well..fat, and I have seen fat turtles become kind of lazy and just sit around. How often and how much do you feed him? Turtles larger than 3 inches long only need to be fed three times a week and they only need to be fed as much food as you think could fit inside his head if it were hollow... That's a good rule of thumb to go by.<br>     Another possibility would be that he has Metabolic Bone Disease (MBD) which is caused by a vitamin D or calcium deficiency. Symptoms of this include a soft shell, shell that looks too small for him, edges of shell curling up, easily broken or overgrown beak and nails... Does he have a UVB light to bask under? A turtle's skin will produce its ow vitamin D when they are exposed to UVB light, and they need the vitamin D to be able to absorb calcium. Also does he have a cuttlebone available to him at all times? Cuttlebone is actually a fish bone, so it is a good natural source of calcium for turtles and I always have one available to them if they feel the need to chew on it.<br>     Red, irritated skin could mean a fungal infection. To address this, make sure his basking area is completely dry and that you are using an open setup or a screen top, not a hood. Turtles need to be able to dry off completely, including the bottom shell. Since many shell rot and fungal infections that affect turtles need constant moisture to thrive, drying off prevents them from setting in. Using a hood can prevent water from evaporating and therefore raise the humidity too much and then the turtle does not dry off even if he has a dry place to pull himself out of the water. You may need to dry dock him (meaning keeping him warm and out of the water for 21 hours out of a day) until you can get it under control. The water also needs to be kept clean. Turtles are very messy, so they need filters rated for 2 to 3 times the amount of water for it to clean adequately. That means, for example, if you have a 20 gallon tank your filter should be rated for 40 to 60 gallons.<br>     Another possibility is a vitamin A deficiency which is characterized by red, raw, thin skin. If you're feeding him the proper diet this should not be your problem, but it's still worth double-checking. I'm not sure what you mean by saying yur turtle is "dull and boring". If you mean the color, it is almost a sure sign of a vitamin A deficiency. If you mean his behavior, it likely means something else is wrong (and I'll get to that in a minute). Anyway, you didn't say what kind of turtle he is, so I can't say exactly what and how much he should be eating. But most turtles eat a combination of whole feeder fish, earthworms, crickets, greens like watercress, kale, turnip greens, spring mix (bagged salad mix), shredded carrots, and romaine, and some pellets like ReptoMin sticks and cichlid food.<br>     A turtle that just sits around and isn't active is never a good sign. I would suggest you check his bottom shell for UNpatterned red spots to rule out septicemia, a blood infection which is fatal if it is not treated quickly with antibiotics. However, I think the above suggested changes (where applicable) should address his problems. If the red irritation on his skin doesn't go away or he doesn't get active again in a few days, he really should see a vet. It could be a sign of parasites or of the fact that he's sick and not showing obvious symptoms.<br>     Sure hope he gets better :)|`|2YIxnXXyaa	<a href="http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/Info/state_resources.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/Info/st...</a><br>  It sounds like you don't need advice from people on Yahoo.<br>  Take your turtle to the vet.<br>  That's a site that has a list of vets who specialize in turtles/tortoises in each state.

2Ku4DuvCaa	You can't expect your parrot to stay where you put him all of the time, and you should permit him to accompany you throughout the house sometimes. <br>  <br>  However, he can be taught to stay where you put him through encouragement. Ask yourself this question: Is there anything on your parrot's cage that's more interesting than you or where he flies to? <br>  <br>  As another has suggested, putting toys that he can shred on his cage is a great idea. In my experience, conures love to rip things apart! When you put him on top of his cage and want him to stay there for awhile, tell him to "Stay." In a firm voice. Obviously, this won't work the first time because he has to learn what that word means. So, when he flies away, pick him up and put him back on his cage. Tell him "no" in a firm voice and then say "stay" again. Beyond that action, do NOT give him any attention for flying off. If you do that, he'll learn that he can get your attention that way, so must be sure that you're only putting him back and telling him no. Rinse and repeat (har har). <br>  <br>  Also, don't just scold him for bad behavior! Be sure to reward him and encourage him when he's done well! During times when he's sitting on top of his cage playing, smile and tell him what a good boy he's being! Shower him with love and offer him treats when he's doing the things that you like him to do. <br>  <br>  By doing these things, you can teach him that he can get your attention and affections by doing the things you want him to do- and not by flying around and wreaking havoc everywhere. <br>  <br>  I've used this method to teach my parrots and many others where they are allowed and not allowed to go. Even the best of them has slip-ups so you have to be persistent. But trust me, the persistence pays off.|`|EJpiaCMQaa	Sun Conures are very curious and tend to like to climb in and under things.  He sounds like he's very active and wants to get into everything.  Sun conures love to chew, so I'd suggest buying him one of those shred-o-boxes.  You can buy them in petstores or online.  Keep it on top of the cage so he'll stay on top of the cage like you want him to.  Also, I suggest buying some new toys and placing them on top of the cage. This may keep him interested in staying on top of the cage.  He may be bored with his old toys.  Give that a try.  It works for my budgies.|`|AA11362465	Hello,<br>  <br>  I have a Sun Conure as well, and as I'm sure you know they are mischievous little parrots! Before I can answer your question further do you stay in the room with him or do you leave? I will be better able to answer why he flies away from his cage.<br>  <br>  Howls,<br>  Timber Wolf
DtkLsetkaa	He is being playful.  Try playing with him for a good amount of time before bed so he is tired and sleeps through the night, or close your bedroom door until he calms down a bit.  I couldn't let my cats in my bedroom at first when I first got them because Dexter would do the same thing, but its been 5 months and they have calmed down and sleep quietly and calmly on the foot of the bed.  Good luck!!|`|UNFxjNHkaa	haha - he's being playful!  My cats still do this from time to time and they're all 8 months - 5 years old.  Cats usually like to play at night (at least my cats do) because they're considered nocturnal.  If he's bothering you just lock him out of the room for a few nights and see if he still does it after that.|`|EvloJtMeaa	He's just being a kitten. They all do that. Mine still does that and he's almost 2 years old. Kitties love to play, it's just very painful when they have claws!! You can put him outside your room if you can't get much sleep, but just be careful he doesn't meow or scratch at your door/carpet all night. They can be very destructive when they want you but can't get to you.|`|UXGDKkHxaa	He is just being playful, i have two cats who were the same when they were little. They still do when they are feeling hungry in the morning!<br>  <br>  Try to bring something comfy in to the bedroom, like a basket or blanket crunched up on the floor so he is encouraged to curl up in his own space.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Of course he's just playing.  That's what kittens do.  They are curious and are exploring their world through play.  Its how they learn (and entertain themselves).|`|AA11343198	playful, my cat is 3 years old and she still likes biting but in a affectionate way of course :)|`|5xQESoC4aa	I used to have a kitten who did that, she also used to climb off my bed and onto my nightstand and knock everything over, I think that the kittens are just curious and I don't want this to sound bad but possibly stupid at that age. The same cat now does no longer climb on my head, haha. Anyways good luck, what I did was just put her outside my room, can't open doors. =]
Dkb2ZR3Daa	I personally feed Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul(light formula) with raw food as treats or a meal substitute.. If you feed a good quality of food you don't need to add human food!...That's why I substitute meals. <br>  <br>  I feed them eggs(not more than 2 a week), pork necks, chicken necks, chicken wings, ground turkey and lamb(for their kongs) liver(not more than once a week) hearts, tongues, mackerels, sardines(again watch for salt)<br>  <br>  Again dogs really don't need extra nor do they need vegetables. That's the human part of us wanting to make them like babies. And since we humans like variety we feel that pets need/wants variety too which is untrue.<br>  <br>  If you like substitute dog cookies/biscuits with baby carrots, apples, bananas, plain fat free yogurt/cottage cheese. *STAY away from gapes/raisins/onions<br>  <br>  And be careful when feeding extras like chicken broth- a lot of salt in it. And no matter how healthy the extras are too many can add unwanted weight!<br>  <br>  I never buy my dogs cookies or biscuits! I use ground meat for their kongs- I'll freeze it, and I use the raw meats as treats it's a great workout for their jaw and teeth!|`|9kTejB0uaa	As a basic diet - none!  Dogs need dog food.  And if you have a picky dog, pandering to him will only make him worse.  You need to get him a good quality dog food, and put it down.  If he doesn't eat in 15/20 minutes, pick it up again until the next mealtime.  Dogs won't starve themselves to collapse and you are the leader, not your dog.<br>  <br>  You can make him up some boiled chicken and rice, or white fish and rice, but unless you want to do this for the entire life of your dog - and actually he does need additives/supplements other than just chicken and rice - you need to stop his habit of expecting to eat what you eat.|`|W0ZQQK4taa	Chicken<br>  Turkey<br>  Carrots<br>  Apples<br>  Raw Egg 2 times a week|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	Picky eaters are made by offering them people food.<br>  <br>   Find a kibble that your dog can digest well, and offer it to him for ten minutes, three times a day, then take it up and put it away.  ONLY give him that, and nothing else.<br>  <br>   I have never seen a healthy dog that would actually starve itself - only dogs that have well trained owners.|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	back a few years ago when they were recalling so many different dog foods, i went to the vet and got ideas on how to make my own food. he told me boiled chicken (no bones) and boiled chicken liver, rice, carrots, green beans. unfortunately it is extremely time consuming, and now that dog food is safe again, we're back to dog food. i recommend you stop people food completely, feed dry food only. if your dog is picky, oh well, when he gets hungry enough, he will eat. put food down twice a day, leave it down 15-30 minutes, if he doesnt eat, pick it back up and try again at the next feeding time. he will eventually eat and you wont be trapped into feeding your dog people food by an obviously demanding dog! take control of your pack|`|LF0nwE0eaa	My mom has been feeding her chihuahua;s chicken, rice, and vegetables for years...use can carrots or green beans...make sure and rinse rice real good, to remove some of the starches....Vet says to cut back and just feed stuff like Iams...or science diet. but they love it....They usually give chick and rice to dogs with gastrointestinal  problems...good luck|`|JmD0oq2Naa	chicken, rice, pasta, tuna, mackerel, eggs|`|7Nzvjkbsaa	Since our dogs depend solely on us to provide their complete nutrition, it is important that whatever food you give them on a regular basis is healthy and balanced.  They need certain foods for protein and fat, others for carbohydrates, others for calcium, etc...  It is not as if they are in the wild and can 'hunt' down what their bodies tell them they need--we are their sole providers.  In addition, cooking food tends to break down proteins in them.<br>  <br>  I would try to get your dog to eat a complete and balanced kibble or wet food; short of that, if you decide to feed a homemade diet you should consider consulting with a pet nutritionist.  Veterinarians are not a suggested route as they are great at treating animal disease; however most do not have a formal education in pet nutrition.  <br>  <br>  Whatever you do feed your pup, make sure you never feed chocolate, grapes, raisins, onions or garlic (large quantities can be toxic to dogs).  In addition, overly-fatty foods can bring on a bout of pancreatitis and sugary foods can lead to diabetes (this includes too much of fruits and some veggies like carrots--they are very healthy in moderation, but too much increases a dog's blood sugar levels after a while).<br>  <br>  Dogs tend to become picky eaters from how their owner feeds them.  If you want your dog to eat healthy food appropriate for it, it is up to you to train him to eat what you give him.  Dogs won't go hungry--they will eat and drink when they need food.  <br>  <br>  I know you are trying to do what is best for your dog, but be sure that what you do in the short-term is healthy enough to continue for the long-term as well.  Nutrition is one way we can help to prevent disease and help our companions lead healthy lives; it is one of the few things we can actually control.  <br>  <br>  Good luck, and feel free to message me if you'd like to speak further!|`|2vz59utAaa	Here is what NOT to feed your dog:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=2+1659&aid=1030" rel="nofollow">http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?...</a>|`|kvHqnR5Haa	Chicken and rice are bland foods that a puppy can handle.
s4OtfZ7Gaa	there is a spray you can get at the pet store that encourages dogs to urinate in a certain area, get that and spray it on the pad. put the puppy in a confined area where he only has room to lay in his bed or use the pad when you are unable to supervise him. a dog doesnt usually use the bathroom where he sleeps, so this will encourage him to use the pad to potty<br>  <br>  also, i agree with kelli L the pads are just an extra step to teaching them to go outside, that you can eliminate completely by crate training. but only use the crate when you arent home or when you cant supervise the pup, and the general rule is to not leave them in there for more than 1 hour for every month old they are (ex. 3month old can hold it for 3 hours|`|cY8DgJv5aa	First, make sure that's really what you want.  Many people believe that training a dog to relieve itself on a puppy pad just simply reinforces using the house as a potty.  When they need to go, they'll go on anything that's similar to a pee pad.  That means carpet or your pile of clothes on the floor.  Later, if you decide you want them to go outside instead, you'll just have to start all over again with the training.<br>  <br>  Secondly, you have to train them to use the pee pad just like you have to train them to go outside.  Put the dog on a leash and walk him/her to the pad.  Let them sniff and if you notice them starting to squat, say a command "Go potty" or something like that.  Then, when they actually go potty on the pad, reward them.  Let them know that what they did was very good.<br>  <br>  Third, you'll have to be very consistent and have a strict schedule.  Depending how old the puppy is will determine how often she should be taken to her potty area.  Every hour is a good start.  Also, about 20 minutes after every meal.|`|C7KzBGlDaa	You definetly have to train it.<br>  everytime it pees, somewhere<br>  besides the pee pad, say no<br>  and then put it on the pee pad. ?|`|PHOyKsmPaa	DONT USE PEE PADS. you are just training him to go in the house!!<br>  DO crate training and take him OUTSIDE TO PEE. You are setting yourself up for disaster with pee pads!|`|qapJU3tMaa	Yuck, why do you want to teach your dog to use pee pads.  They only teach the dog that it's okay to go in the house.  Take the dog outside to go, and when not supervised, CRATE.|`|YUcl70rbaa	thats gross....just take the puppy outside every couple of hours...you are training your dog to pee inside...not cool.|`|rFsgjl7Paa	train it ,so it will learn to pee on the pee pad!...      :D|`|1S5OPJH1aa	tazer it every time it doesnt?|`|8Ld9Dmgeaa	train it.

SOxdyWQOaa	could be swim bladder|`|GHpcc5iKaa	Sounds like it needs oxygen. Even a small plant would help give it air but i would recommend an air pump.|`|dE5fs9yzaa	Bettas don't need an air pump like other tropicals..(friends of mine have had two males for four years now without an airpump and I use to bred bettas so I'm not guessing.) I've seen that behavior before. Is the water heated? if not, he is probably just resting, conserving his energy because the water is colder then he likes. If you don't see any white spots on him (ick) or any sign of fin rot and he is eating okay...I think he's just not an active fish. With their long flowing fins, they can get "tail" heavy and at rest, show this behavior. If you don't have a heater, please get one.|`|sZ0McynSaa	It sounds like it is short on air, change the water and get an air pump for your tank.|`|ti2DETQRaa	Your fish is probably dead, sister.|`|IYH49BKHaa	it prolly needs more air
YUQgyPT3aa	as with any procedure, there are risks...but they are minimal and your vet will discuss them with you.|`|1XLZdOcQaa	Spaying or neutering will keep your dog from getting pregnant or impregnating another dog. Females get the spay surgery, which removes the ovaries and uterus, while a neuter surgery removes a male dog's testicles.<br>  <br>  If you're cringing after reading this last sentence, consider this: the surgery provides many health and behavior benefits, and you won't find yourself with a bunch of puppies who need homes other than yours.<br>  <br>  Here's a link that can help you with your question. good luck!<br>  <a href="http://lnk.nu/dogtime.com/t76.html" rel="nofollow">http://lnk.nu/dogtime.com/t76.html</a>|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	there are always risks with surgery, but there are also risks in not spaying your pet. all in all the benefits of spaying totally outweigh the risks, go for it!!!! also, i'm sure florida aid to animals is a fine organization and i have heard good things about them from people who have used them, though i have not used them myself. the only thing i would REALLY recommend is making sure your dog has a kennel cough vaccine before taking her there, as many people send their dogs to get fixed who currently have kennel cough, this will protect your dog, also, get an e-collar to prevent her from licking or chewing the surgical wound after surgery as a precaution!!!
asEeCmzraa	I think the fact that you didn't receive an apology from the vet is totally unprofessional and unacceptable. <br>  <br>  How used to having her claws clipped is she? does she flinch a lot when her paws are touched? She may have flinched when the claw was cut, resulting in that close a cut. I doubt that it was done on purpose- All the other claws seem okay. <br>  <br>  I would be more angry at the lack of explanation you received and honestly, the vet would have got a blasting from me about the issue. I would advise ringing up the vet, telling them what happened, and how unimpressed you are. If their response isn't appropriate, tell them that you will be taking your business elsewhere.|`|AA10283080	If that were my dog I probably wouldn't have made it out of the office without saying something to them about it. There is no excuse for the pain they put your dog through and I would tell them right up front that I would never be coming back and that I will share my experience with as many people as I can.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	Nope.  Even the best groomers and vets will sometimes clip the nails too short.  Probably your dog jumped or pulled at just the wrong moment.  She's not gonna die, and if you don't make a fuss over it she will have forgotten it by tomorrow.|`|c7c42fcd2fd4b62ba49207bebbdb931daa	Wow, my dogs have had their quicks cut, but that's ridiculous!  You should have said something to the girl who brought her out, or at least call them today and complain about it.|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	First off I would not take a dog to the Vets just to get a nail trim unless the dog to be sedated for the procedure.  Go to a groomer who does it day in & day out.  They have much more experience in trimming nails than a Vet does.<br>  <br>  Sometimes it is hard to clip nails if the dog is not cooperating.  With the dog jerking his foot & leg it is easy to clip a nail too short (but not that short) & cause a little bit of bleeding.<br>  <br>  Due to what happened he may never cooperate again because of the pain he received.|`|GHpcc5iKaa	Yes i would be upset! no more then that id be really ticked, but that would have hurt her very bad because of the vein in the nail which was obviously cut. this may cause an infection which could eventually lead to the death of her. Im not sure if its necessary to take her to the vet so take her to a local pet store and ask them about and they could tell you how serious it is. By the way this is a very important thing and you need to talk to the people who clipped her. this may just call for the court!|`|MT0gw2hmaa	OMG! I would be sooo Mad! I would make a federal case of it! Your poor little innocent dog. They should refund you the money you paid, offer you an apology and that person who did it, needs to get trained. On top of being trained the person that brought him to you needs to learn customer service and common courtesy. They should be following up on your dog by calling you and offer a checkup and add'l medicines. (Infection and pain) Does the vet know what happened? If its his private practice he should know, what incompetent fools he has in working for him!  Don't let them get away with this, go back asap and let them know your upset will report them for abuse. Next time if you go back, they will think twice about their behavior.|`|yEUo24Znaa	Yes.  Mad at them and mad at yourself. Looking at the pics, I can tell your dog's nails are WAY too long,  even with the trim they are too long. You need to learn to trim them yourself, and you need to trim them frequently.   An excessively long nail in the dachshund is an open invitation for leg problems, which they can hardly afford.|`|s76aC4G8aa	Good Lord someone when Clipper crazy.  Clipping thru the entire nail like that Is horrendous, dremmeling the nails back that far is one thing but they used clippers, on my goodness the freaking pain that poor dog endured.<br>  <br>  All I can say is that person should not be cutting nails AT ALL.  See I'm really friendly with the staff at my vets office, if I noticed that I would definitely have said something and complained.|`|dE5fs9yzaa	This looks like it was done by someone who knew nothing about what they were doing1 i would talk to the vet himself (herself) and demand treatment..free treatment. I'd be careful about neosporin on it as she could lick it off.<br>  Really, I would get right on the phone and call the vet yourself and demand treat,ent of this...your dog could get an infection now, its cut so close! Yes, nails sometimes bleed but this one is cut completely off!!!!!|`|WiycCxpzaa	That should have been addressed while you were still at the Vet's office. I would have chewed them a new one for that and refuse to ever bring my dog back there.|`|AA11193401	yes i would & i don't even have a dog|`|1Du4Rudvaa	I would be upset if they didn't tell me before I saw the dog.  I cut my own dogs nails so I know that those things do happen(not that bad), but they do have a product(quick stop) that can be put on the nail to stop the bleeding and if they didn't have that they shouldn't have even cut the nails.  Sometimes the dogs foot moves, but again they should have used the a clipper that has a guard on it.  I guess I would be more mad that they didn't have proper equipment.  If they don't have proper equipment for a simple nail trim there is no way that I would take my dog there to have anything major actually done, like surgery.|`|c90696a851f3ee0c6b1f63f7f595eca4aa	Okay, I have to agree with you. With dogs who have black nails, it is impossible to see where the quick is, but you'd have to be stupid to think it's that far back, although it might have just been an accident. As I said in your last question, you should learn to do it yourself. You'll save a lot of money and you can be in control of how much nail is taken off. After your dog's bath, give her nails a slight trim. I trim my dogs' nails frequently, but only a tiny bit at a time, so there is no risk of cutting into the quick.|`|3hBQz33Yaa	You are not over reacting! I have to take one of my dogs to get groomed regularly and if he came out of there bleeding i would be raising some hell! Especially since the lady just handed him to you and took off. That is so wrong i would have thrown a fit for sure, not paid for the grooming AND told them i'd be finding another groomer so they can stick it where the sun don't shine!|`|rzO0RX9vaa	Wow, I would be so mad!  That is horrible and is for sure causing alot of pain, poor little thing!  I would call up there and talk to the dr. or whoever is in charge and let them know how mad you are.  This is cause for them to be sued, maybe they can compensate you someway...if they are not total jerks that is.|`|1w2fj3l2aa	YES YOU HAVE EVERY REASON TO BE MAD,ACCIDENTS HAPPEN BUT NOT TO SAY ANYTHING AND WALK AWAY IS B.S. I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL I ALSO LOVE MY DOG VERY MUCH & WOULD BE FIT TO BE TIED IF SOMEONE DID THAT TO MY LITTLE DUDE.(DOG)MAKE SURE THE PRACTICE OWNER   KNOWS ABOUT THIS.GOOD LUCK|`|2G6b5y8Taa	I would be upset i wouldn't take her back there it shows they don't know what the are doing with the dogs and the have no moral values to not at least say something|`|S07L4Ac5aa	Yes i would be very mad|`|D9PfvS5Oaa	i would be PISSED!!|`|uicbw4Eeaa	i would be pist off lol|`|QpVGiKehaa	Yes, I would. The vet above all should know well cutting a dog's toenail too near the flesh will cause pain and bleeding. This will give the dog toenail clipper phobia and will panic every time it sees it, making it harder to clip her toenails. And their behaviour is disgusting, shouldn't they be telling you and apologize or even return back your payment? <br>  <br>  But, I think is best if you take your dog to that vet and show them what they did so they'll be more careful next time to your dog or other dogs.|`|mRevWUxlaa	Im so sorry this happened and it is painful for the dog. I work for a vet and the technicians usually do the nail's. We never had such an extreme case like this though. The nail will grow back. I would use another vet next time. They have a file that is electric that you can buy and doesn't hurt the dog at all if you feel that you don't wish to put your dog through this again. They sell them at Petco and other pet retail stores.|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	would i be upset? yes. was it wrong that she didnt show you and explain what happened? yes. will he be ok? yes. i did look at the pictures and that was a really big mistake on their part. i would recommend contacting the vet, asking to speak to the office manager and letting them know how dissatisfied you were with the way you and your dog were treated! it was very unprofessional not to explain what happened. most likely your dog jerked his leg away as she was pressing on the nail clippers. a completely innocent accident but it should have been handled more properly
84558de0349fa374ed3605ac33e8e36daa	definitely take her to a vet. Bad breath on cats is a bad sign and the drooling tops it off. I hope she'll be alright!!!|`|AA10229248	Take her to the vet. It is entirely possible she has an infected or abscessed tooth. Only a vet can determine if that is the cause and prescribe the appropriate medications required to fix the problem, or extract the tooth if necessary.|`|RT8LZy7gaa	Cats, like people, can develop dental problems.  Some cats never get tartar build up, some seem to get it all the time and need frequent dental cleanings.<br>  <br>  Since she is so young, take her to the vet so they can check her for an abcess or other abnormality.  If there's an infection, it could be life threatening (just like people, mouth bacteria is infectious and usually goes straight to the heart).  There's no harm in having the vet check her and you'll be very happy if (1) you know there's nothing physically wrong with her and (2) you can get the problem resolved.<br>  <br>  Some cats do drool when they're happy but at her age it shouldn't smell as bad as you describe. My feeling is that there's an underlying problem.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|MmRDzhaHaa	A drooling problem is most likely a dental problem, so get her to a vet for a descaling and to check for any gum problems, and even a bad tooth that could be come infected.|`|BY0cV4kRaa	The cat  got teeth & gum disease.

v0RsFaAzaa	It's spelled Chihuahua! Why did you allow your Chihuahua to breed, if you don't know what you are doing? You don't even know what the signs of pregnancy are, which is one of the first things you should know!  You should have had her Spayed, then you would not have to be worrying about this now. She has to go to the vet!!! The vet will tell you how far along she is, an approximate due date, how many puppies she is carrying and how big the puppies are. Chihuahuas are known to have complications and some require C-Sections, because the puppies may be too big for her to deliver herself. What breed was the male, that you bred her with? If the male is larger than she is, then you will have problems and she can DIE during whelping. Ask the vet what he or she thinks should be the next step you should take and listen carefully to what the vet tells you! When the vet says it's safe, have her Spayed, so this never happens again!|`|1XLZdOcQaa	Physically, my best bet to check if a dog is pregnant is swollen nipples. There can also some changes in the behavior, which, at times may be mistaken for misbehavior.

9440e28b2ef820fd5eab4d5cfc34217faa	Poor baby!<br>  <br>  Honestly, you may want another vet who will actually try to find out what's going on with your kitten.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|f10424ac1ac7b1791b4f665094823d61aa	Sadie, I don't know where you live, but if you live in the UK, I would suggest you get some homoeopathic Nux Vomica 6c from your pharmacy.  Most chemists and pharmacies sell it in the Nelsons Range.   It cures virtually all cases of very severe consipation in animals especially when the stool is very large.<br>  <br>  Crush one tablet up (with the back of a spoon), and sprinkle it on to her food, do this 3 times a day.<br>  <br>  Mysterious bowel problems in young kittens often respond very well to this.   I cured my own adopted cat from dreadful bowel problems. The previous owner just couldn't cope with them and that's why he was up for adoption.   <br>  <br>  He's been completely cured and has been fine for 5 years now.<br>  <br>  I hope your kitty will be okay, I know how sad it is to have a sick cat, cos all you want to do is to help it get better.|`|iZ2J85Hpaa	All you can really do is keep on taking her to the vet for check-ups after the vet is sure this problem, whatever it was, has cleared up.

54GBWTgoaa	my puppy had this, im pretty sure it sounds like kennel cough, the vets will give you some meds and may advise you to get the kennel cough jab that makes your dog less prone to catching it again, the vets gave me meds but after a week she still had it, so advised by my trainer we bought some benalyn for kids and gave it to her for about two 2 weeks and then it shifted, i think the vets meds got rid of the worst part, give him some boiled rice mixed with boiled chicken or his other food>> this will stop the runs, and keep him hydrated, so maybe add some water to his food. and after the vets wash all his bedding and if he's in the yard wash the path with hot soapy water, kennel cough is highly contagious and he could have caught it from a twig  not necessarily another dog!|`|FdcWPp48aa	Sounds like he may have kennel cough.  It is easily treatable.  Please take him to see the vet.<br>  <br>  ADD:  Do not take him back to the pound.  Most animal shelters do not have funds to treat animals and those who even sneeze are euthanized to prevent spreading disease throughout the compound.  Just take him to the vet to get the right meds.  He will be okay.|`|m9eSPvdfaa	I don't think it's kennel cough. It would be helpful to know what kind of food you are feeding him and what the diarhea looks like. Is he still drinking enough water? Is he lathargic? No one on here can tell you what's wrong with your dog or how serious it is without more info. However, I'd contact the animal shelter and find out what they were feeding him. If he is still active and drinking plenty of water you may want to dry different food. Some dogs are very sensitive to a sudden change in diet. Hope this helps and hope he is alright!|`|FaPrr8bbaa	Bless you for adopting.  If the vet knows he has new symptoms he might let him have a sooner appointment.  It wouldn't hurt to call and show the phone person that you are worried.  It always gets my appointment changed. :)|`|AA10726599	I would take him back to the pound and let them treat him.

With the runs you could try plain chicken and rice. The reason he's/she's not eating is he/she can't smell too well right now with the cold, just like you and I can't taste or smell when we're congested. The chicken might entice him/her to eat. Good luck.|`|idMpK0suaa	You don't have to put him down just because of that! Just take him to a veterinarian. He probably has kennel cough. Where did you adopt him from? If it's a pet store, than no wonder. Just have your vet treat him, then he'll be fine again.|`|AA10577622	Take to the Vet now!
uBFhKXgHaa	Both President's Choice and Science Diet are /crap/, so I guess you could say they are comparable foods.<br>  <br>  Not all pet food is made equally. A lot of it is full of corn, by-products, dyes, unhealthy preservatives, filler grains and all sorts of nasty stuff. A lot of pet food companies are perfectly happy to the dump cheap leftovers and things that aren't safe for human consumption (from human food processing plants) into their foods. Will it kill your cat? No, it has to be nutritionally complete and safe to even be marketed. Is it healthy? Not by a long shot.<br>  <br>  Corn is a low quality ingredient you never want to see in your pet food. Corn and low quality grains are two of the biggest culprits when it comes to food allergies in our pets.<br>  <br>  Thankfully, there are some excellent cat foods being made these days that include organic, human grade ingredients rather than trash not fit for human consumption.<br>  <br>  Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Whiskas, Fancy Feast, Friskies, Meow Mix.<br>  <br>  Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Felidae, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timber Wolf Organics.<br>  <br>  Although the high quality foods are more expensive, you're getting what you're paying for. Less filler material and higher quality ingredients means more concentrated nutrients... this means you typically need to feed far less of the high quality food than you would of the low quality one. Which also means less poop!<br>  <br>  Seriously on a budget? Two of the most affordable of the higher quality foods would be Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul and Felidae.<br>  <br>  Before following your vet's food recommendation, keep in mind that vets get /very/ little nutritional training during their schooling. Besides that, what training they /do/ get is usually sponsored or taught by... you guessed it, the crappy pet food companies! They also often get kickbacks from the companies for pushing these products at their clinics (Science Diet, Royal Canin etc.)<br>  <br>  A great option is to go with an entirely grain-free diet. Diets high in grain/carbohydrates have been attributed to problems with diabetes in cats. Cats are obligate carnivores, so why should there be grain in their diet? Many of the high quality foods now put out grain-free formulas. Some good grain-free diets include: Innova EVO, Wellness CORE, Blue Wilderness, Nature's Variety Instinct, Orijen, Horizon Legacy, Fromm Surf & Turf, Now!, GO Natural Grain Free, Sold Gold Indigo Moon, Ziwipeak, and Taste of the Wild.<br>  <br>  Some pretty decent foods can even be found in common pet stores. Petsmart carries Blue Buffalo products (such as the excellent grain free diet Blue Wilderness). Petco carries Wellness, Solid Gold, Natural Balance, Eagle Pack Holistic Select, Blue Buffalo, Castor & Pollux Organix, Pinnacle, and Halo. <br>  <br>  If you can't find a food, most of the high quality cat food brands have websites with store locators on them that will help you find the store closest to you which supplies their products. Simply type the cat food brand's name into Google, go to their website, and type your zip code into their store locator.<br>  <br>  Another option, if you can't find anywhere around you that sells good foods, is to order your pet food online. Here's an excellent place to do so: <a href="http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/</a><br>  <br>  Remember that foods should be switched gradually (mixing the new slowly in with the old over the period of about week or so), especially when switching to a higher quality one, so as not to upset tummies. For example:<br>  Days 1 & 2: 75% old food, 25% new food<br>  Days 3 & 4: 50% old food, 50% new food<br>  Days 5 & 6: 25% old food, 75% new food<br>  Day 7: 0% old food, 100% new food<br>  <br>  Another option for feeding cats is to feed raw. This is something that should be thoroughly researched before being attempted:<br>  <a href="http://www.rawfedcats.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rawfedcats.org/</a> (Raw Fed Cats)<br>  <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/rawdogs/profile/" rel="nofollow">http://community.livejournal.com/rawdogs...</a> (Raw Dogs Livejournal Community [not just for dogs despite the name!], excellent raw feeding information on the profile page and overall helpful community for raw feeding questions)<br>  <a href="http://www.rawfed.com/myths/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rawfed.com/myths/index.html</a> (Myths About Raw Feeding)<br>  <br>  Now the question is, do you feed wet or dry? Wet is the correct answer. The reason is, in the wild, cats normally get most of their water content directly from their prey items and drink very little. Domestic cats are no different, and because of the fact that they are designed to take in water with their meal, they have a very low thirst drive. Cats often just don't drink enough. This leads to urinary tract infections and crystals. The bit about dry food being better for teeth is a myth and has not been proven in the least (cats barely even chew their dry food and, really, does a pretzel clean /your/ teeth? Cats should have their teeth brushed with cat toothbrushes and cat toothpaste at least a few times a week as well as see the vet for dental cleanings when necessary /regardless/ of what they are being fed). Canned/wet food is better because it more closely mimics the cat's natural diet. More on why canned food is best:<br>  <a href="http://www.catinfo.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.catinfo.org/</a>  (Excellent cat nutrition information by a vet)<br>  <a href="http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?action=library&act=show&item=whycatsneedcannedfood" rel="nofollow">http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...</a> (Why Cats Need Canned Food)<br>  <a href="http://cats.about.com/cs/catfood/a/canned_food.htm" rel="nofollow">http://cats.about.com/cs/catfood/a/canne...</a> (Canned Cat Food: Can Your Cat Afford to Live Without it?)<br>  <a href="http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bpo_ch4.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bp...</a> (The Dry Food Crisis)<br>  <a href="http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.htm" rel="nofollow">http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.ht...</a> (Max's House: Feline Nutrition)<br>  <br>  Another option to get cats to drink more would be a cat fountain. Cats tend to like to drink from running water and cat fountains see to that need, encouraging cats to take in more water.<br>  <br>  Also remember that freefeeding (leaving food down) is the fast lane to feline obesity. Make sure to have scheduled feeding times loosely based on the feeding guidelines on your cat's food. Adult cats are typically fed two meals a day.<br>  <br>  More:<br>  <a href="http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_reviews/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_...</a> (Dog food reviews.

I would take advice feed cats low carb high protein foods there are lists to review on line at Binky's charts. GOOD LUCk main muscle not by products!|`|IQezKzNEaa	Unfortunately, I could not find the guaranteed analysis for President's Choice.  The website does have the ingredients:<br>  <br>  Liver, meat by-products, poultry by-products, beef, whole egg, brown rice, rice flour, oat bran, cellulose, vegetable gums, lactosucrose, iodized salt, brewer's dried yeast, vitamins and minerals; with water sufficient for processing.<br>  <br>  The main thing that I worry about in this ingredient list is the high amount of "by-products" (this could be feathers, beaks, hooves, etc) and that the second ingredient is "meat" by-products; you don't even know what kind of meat.<br>  <br>  However, you first want to check that the label has "complete and balanced" on the label, not just balanced.  This means it at least has been formulated to meet your cat's basic needs.  <br>  <br>  You also have to look at the guaranteed analysis.  Convert protein, fat, and fiber into dry matter basis (meaning taking out the water content) by dividing each % number by 1-moisture.  (Ex: crude protein is 35%, but moisture is 12%, so divide 35 by .88 to get 39.8% CP on a DM basis.)  On a dry matter basis for an adult cat at maintenance (1-6 years old, indoor cat), the crude protein should be around 35%, the crude fat should be around 10%, and the crude fiber should be less than 5%.  You may also want to convert the Calcium and Phosphorus to get the Ca/P ratio, which should be around 1.2 (divide Ca% DM basis by P% DM basis).  Magnesium is also important to look at; it should be LESS THAN .15% on a DM basis; higher, and you'll have problems with FLUTD (urinary tract disorders).<br>  <br>  All this is just to make sure you can feed this to your cat!  <br>  <br>  Science Diet is "vet recommended" ...but did you know that it is possible for veterinarians to get into vet school without a single nutrition class?  And, to top that, they can GRADUATE vet school without a single nutrition class.  And yet, they want to recommend diets.  I started out in college as a pre-vetter, and this shocked me as well as it should shock you.  Science Diet spends tons of money to make sure they are "vet recommended," and they are the company that I trust the very least.  <br>  <br>  I recommend looking at diets that have wholesome ingredients with whole meats as the first ingredients, and foods that do not have corn, wheat, or soy in them, as these are relatively indigestible by cats.  Cats are carnivores; they really don't eat anything other than meat in the wild, so loading them up on carbohydrates leads to problems down the road, such as diabetes.  I personally recommend Blue Buffalo, but this is just a preference.<br>  <br>  The foods that I would choose are fairly high in price, so if you can't quite afford these, Purina One is a decent diet that won't kill your cat.|`|AA10859773	It's horrid.

Tortoises' stomachs aren't built for digesting it.<br>  For fruits, some tomatoes, strawberries, watermelon, raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, etc.  Any fruits, but not a lot.<br>  No potatoes what so ever.

This includes leafy greens such as cabbage, spinach and lettuce (not iceberg). Grass is an important part of the diet so this can be fed along with dandilions (washed so there's no pesticides etc on them). When the weather allows the tortoise should be put in a run outside for exercise and to graze the grass (they are natural grazers). For variety in the diet you can add small amounts of cucumber, brocolli, beans and some fruit. Fruit should be fed in very small quanities as it sometimes causes stomach upset. <br>  <br>  A tortoise care plan, such as one on the British Chelonia Group website can give more detail on what you can and can't feed them.|`|PzfozDAJaa	The Leopard tortoise is a large and attractively marked tortoise which has a wide distribution in sub-Saharan Africa, including Botswana. In this species males may attain a greater size than females. The leopard tortoise is approximately 2 feet long which is the biggest turtle in Africa. It weighs 50 to 100 lbs. Its name comes from the color of its shell which has black and yellow spots, look like a leopard. The young have dark brown or black leopard patterns on their shells while adults have smaller spots. The bowl is hard, and bumpy. There is a v shaped notch in the front of the shell. Leopard tortoises have thick club-like back legs that have scales with claws on their toes. They don't have webbed feet. The head, legs, and tail can be almost completely drawn under the shell.  <br>  <br>  hope this helped you :)|`|lndaCQmGaa	<a href="http://inall.lovez.it" rel="nofollow">http://inall.lovez.it</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website

It cost me $70+tax, at my regular vet it would have been $160+tax.|`|z2TjjnxVaa	It depends on where your from really. I live in Ontario as well, even in Ontario the numbers are drastically different. I live in Oakville(just outside of Toronto) I got quoted for my 30 lb dog $450 before anything added. I called around to about 5 vets and that's what they said. I took him to a small town outside of Hamilton and they did it for $120. Thankfully I already knew that vet and like them so it made the process easier.<br>  <br>  Call around and make sure you get a decent price, and also more importantly that you like the vet.|`|XKNQkwuGaa	i am in ontario canada and i called my vet the other day for prices on altering my year and a half old poochi. if he weighs over 20 lbs it is $272 plus tax and under 20 lbs $254 so i called the vet across the border in the states and it is $45 or $65 depending on what kind of meds u want to use while he is under. i take fonzie on the 24 of march accross the border to have him done. with the prices of vets here in canada it is a wonder that there are so many pups being born since it is so expensive to have them altered. i always have my pets spayed and last summer my border collie needed surgery for a bladder stone at my vets and it was almost $1700 with the surgery and meds so i had to put off fonzies alteration and deal with cleo instead. check around different vets in ur area and hopefully u will find one that is caring about keeping the dog population down and the price is reasonable. good luck|`|89c7e5af6668337660a2665976affbf3aa	That totally depends on the vets in your area.

Put it on your neck and turn it on and see how much you like it. If you can't properly control your dog off leash, then don't let him off leash unless in an enclosed area. I would suggest training your dog to obey you better before you let him off leash in a 3acre yard with no boundaries.<br>  <br>   I expected thumbs down from dog abusers, thanks for not dissapointing me! <br>  <br>  Sirius, guess we are the only two humane people on this question.

DtkLsetkaa	Lemon and orange peels, sprinkled in the garden.  Cats hate the smell of citrus.  Not to mention, since its natural, it will just decay and fade into your garden and its nutritious to the plants.  Or you could just keep your cat inside.  That works too :)<br>  <br>  And good lord the trolls are out in force today, ugh.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	To keep cats out of the garden, the best thing to do first is to lay some soft netting down in rows in between all the flowers. You can use chicken wire also. Put several rocks at the edge of the netting to keep it in place better. You can sprinkle a thin layer of soil over the netting, and use decorative rocks so it‘s not obvious why they are there. If any cat tries to dig in the soil, their claws will get stuck in the netting, (or wire). Next, you can apply some repellent to the rocks. You can purchase some cat repellent at any pet store. Cats don’t like the smell of citrus fruit, so it is an excellent deterrent for gardens and plants. Citrus scented cleaners can be another means of keeping cats out of your garden. Be aware that you will need to re-apply this occasionally since the scent will wash off with water.<br>  <br>  Another idea that may involve less maintenance but more money is to set up sprinklers attached to motion sensors. So when the cat walks near the garden, the sprinklers will turn on, scaring the cat away.<br>  <br>  ** Never use mothballs, because they can harm the cat. Mothballs are composed of naphthalene and/or paradichlorobenzene; both are toxic substances. By law in the US, pesticides can not be used for purposes other than stated on the label. Mothballs are a pesticide. Scattering them over the yard for repelling animals is definitely not on the label. Mothballs have been implicated in several poisonings of small children who mistake them for candy. The label almost certainly states that they are not to be placed where they can be accessed by children. They could also be hazardous for animals such as cats and dogs. **<br>  <br>  ** Burying orange or lemon peels may deter cats, but it may attract other animals such as raccoons. **|`|xEZqZgaYaa	the vet has a special powder or liquid, i cant remember what it is, but i deters animals from going in the garden. i think its like a jelly crystal thing. i was reading a bottle of it a few weeks ago out of interest.|`|cjMai5PGaa	ha thats a shitty problem to have lol sorry couldn't resist|`|VTb8FpzHaa	move them to a place he can't jump|`|4swYFtsSaa	read the bible the answers are always in it you just have to look my girl|`|g6RIchtuaa	I am confused as to why a cat would do that.

NnYB9eXiaa	Hi :)    You didn't tell us if it's a Syrian (Teddy Bear, Golden, Panda) or a dwarf species so I'm leaving in the note about dwarfs.    Hamsters are omnivores, but you should avoid treated meats such as ham (or any pork actually) and anything with added salt.  If you give lettuce as a treat, use romaine not iceberg (it has no nutritional value at all) - or better yet feed your hammy fresh spinach :)    Any time you introduce a new food to your pet, do it in very small amounts, only feed it once and see how their little tummy handles it.  Some hamsters do better than others with certain foods, but with a little time you'll come up with a snack list that your hamster will love - and that will give them the extra nutrients they may not get from their daily food mix or lab blocks! Don't leave the fresh food in their cage for more than 4 hours or it can go bad :)    Note: Because dwarf hamsters are somewhat prone to diabetes, it is prudent to avoid much sugar in their diet, so avoid fruits as treats for dwarf hamsters. Items with *** should not be given to dwarf hamsters!      Some suggested fruits and vegetables:    *** apples (no seeds!)  *** bananas  *** blueberries  *** cherries (fresh, no pits)  * broccoli  * carrots  * cauliflower  * cucumber  * dandelions greens  *** grapes  * kale  *** peas  * potato (cooked)  * romaine lettuce - not iceberg  * spinach  *** strawberries  *** sweet potato  * squash  * zucchini    Other treats:    * hay   * whole grain bread or toast  * whole wheat pasta (cooked)  * brown rice (cooked)  * whole grain cereal (no sugary cereal)  * meal worms  * crickets or  * small pieces of cooked chicken  * bit of hard boiled eggs  * nuts (no almonds; unsalted) - in moderation  * unsalted peanuts - in moderation  * pumpkin seeds  * lentils (cooked)  * sunflower seeds - in moderation  * plain air popped popcorn (no butter or salt!)  * plain dog biscuits    What to Avoid    * celery (the fiber strings can choke them and high sodium content)  * watermelon (high water content)  * high amounts of lettuce (high water content)  * pork  * raw beans (kidney beans, black beans, lentils)  * raw potatoes  * almonds  * citrus fruit  * garlic  * onions  * rhubarb leaves or raw rhubarb  * chocolate  * peanut butter  * any sugary or salty foods  * any junk food    This is just a basic list, but gives you an idea of what you can and can't give as treats - please feel free to msg me if you need any more help or aren't sure about a certain food you want to try that isn't on the list :)    Daisy|`|uDQmkdouaa	i think that daisy girl said it all. but i just wanted to sat that my hamster died last may and we dicided not to get another and now im reaading all of the questions and i really want another one! =D    good luck with your baby! =D|`|N8DgVu9Aaa	All hamsters are different so you can't say what their fav food is.

Lucinda|`|qAoWgQbRaa	There's these treats you can get that are made of oats/corn/berries/honey (there are many different variations). For a start, they love anything that combines different tastes. The best thing about these bars though is the fact that they're made around a wooden 'spine' with a hook coming out of one end so you hang it off the bars of the cages. I always get the best response from these kind of treats. My hamsters get bored of anything I give them that they can't have fun with, so by hanging the treat they need to reach up/grab it/ hold on to it/ catch it swinging and eat in between, it not only makes sure they eat in moderation - it also ensures they get some exercise and have fun!
QnJvJ67uaa	A rider is said to have a hot seat when their riding style makes horses play up. Some people ride tense and give off an aura of fear even if outwardly they don't look like it.  I know a child who has got through more ponies than hot dinners...the slowest easiest pony will bolt and buck with her.  This can be handy to have to liven up slow pokes but most "hot seats" can be improved with more training and confidence and a laid back horse.|`|Vlg2PXFJaa	Hmmm...  I have never heard of it either and I've been riding all my life!! are you sure your friend hasn't misheard? hot seat generaly means to be put on the spot!|`|z0iTOf88aa	A hot seat typically refers to someone that will tend to drive with their seat instead of relying on other aids (which doesn't necessarily mean that these types of riders will take a deep seat).  This can be a good thing if they are riding a slow and lazy horse because it can get them moving a bit more than they otherwise would, but can also be a bad thing if they are riding a sensitive/"hot headed" type of horse as it will only add to their "tricks"/playfullness.  I have found that riders with hot seats will typically do better on a lazy/laid back/slower type of horse rather than a "hot headed" horse because the "hot headed" horse will tend to get riled up much more quickly than the slow/lazy/laid back horse.|`|4gxpMDsJaa	I agree with Debbie, tho it can also result from something the rider is wearing that irritates the horse, eg. chaps or laces on boots or a jacket, or even carrying a whip if the horse has cause to worry about that. I think it can also be sheer personality - I knew a horse which was a slug with everyone except one teenage girl, which he seemed to have a crush on, judging by his response when she arrived. In her hands he was very lively & willing to canter & jump!|`|uec7RIhbaa	"hot seat" is often used as a term meaning "tense" which often gee's up horses and makes them go faster than normal.  many riders who have hot seat are not necessarily nervous but there's definately a magical ingredient in some people that create this!!!  it can also be commonly termed "electric seat" which means the same thing!!!|`|AA10886678	hi    yes i have heard and have used that term    it means the rider has a tendancy to 'wind up' the horse, making it over excited or more energetic to normal    you can also say 'hot bum'|`|3a1e378691e31e4af23432441a473407aa	Yes, I have heard of this.  It is someone who tends to be able to fire normally quiet horses up!  Only my days it was called a hot bum.  The rider might be hyperactive which made them a bit spirited.  I remember a friend who would ride her horse and it would be quite spirited.  I would ride it and it would calm down - and when she rode my fairly steady horse that would go fast.    A hot seat might be good for eventing, but not for the general welfare of the horse who will lose condition if ridden in such a manner.|`|5kUxkun3aa	wow some of your answers make it sound like a hot seat can make a horse fizz up etc. well jockeys should have a hot seat then! lol  a person who has a"hot seat" does not have every horse they ride swinging from the ceiling. just a sometimes a little more forward going. i have a "hot seat" and not every horse i ride is likely to bomb off!|`|gJE0ujbzaa	A "hot seat" or "electric butt" is a seat where the person is sitting hard in the saddle, and attempting to push the horse forward with their bum. Often they will rock their body as well.  Sometimes the rider will also clamp their leg on the horse, but most of the time the leg is shifted forward or not being used.    when a rider rides like this, it tends to make the horse want to put their head up, hollow out their back, and either stop and refuse to move forward, or get nervous and want to run off to try and get away from the pressure on his back.  Basically, it hurts the horse's back, drives it down, and the horse starts acting up because it is very uncomfortable.    Some people do this thinking they are using a "deep seat".  It is not the same. With a good deep seat, the person is sitting deep, but relaxed, not driving with their seat. They will also have a strong leg.  Without leg, a deep seat won't help a horse go forward, it will just turn into a "driving seat" with essentially the same reaction as above-not the ones you want.    To make a horse go forward, or to help him relax, a rider needs his leg against the horse's sides to where they can use as much pressure from their leg as they are using with their seat. And the LEG needs to be carrying the riders weight, NOT the seat.  Even though you should be sitting well into the saddle(with a relaxed bent hip and knee), your leg should be supporting you in such a way that you can easily get off the horse's back in a moment if you need to, or continue sitting deep if you need to.  Your position should be the same as it would be when you are walking-with your weight on your legs, most of it landing in the heel, a bent knee, and relaxed hip that can easily bend with your movement.|`|NCm9cB7Zaa	well, Its basically what the two previous people have said, but usually, when you refer to someone 'having a hot seat", it literally looks (if you're spectating) that they're moving about. Its alright if you ride a lazy horse, as it asks for more impulsion, but on any other horse, it can confuse/annoy/disrupt them and makes other aids (legs etc) less strong effective and usually make the schooling session less effective too...    so yeah usually not a great thing... Its better if you have a quiet seat and sit deep/light depending on the horse and give your aids as per usual as they will be responded to better.    hope it helps :)|`|AA12212950	If its the same thing as electric bum syndrum I have it.    Generally means I sit a bit forward and fairly lightly. As a result I can't ride really forward going horses as it makes them more hyper and I usually end up just bombing about the arena.|`|an1L8njXaa	I have an electric bum which is what i think you are refering to.     I certainly dont move around in the seat or anything, im perfectly capable of riding both very lazy horses and very sharp advanced dressage horses.  What it does mean however is that i do have to be careful when im riding and make sure that i can calm the horse.  Some people just give off forward going vibes!|`|QINxxFTmaa	ive got what they call a electric bum can get the slowest horse to move its caused by using ya bum and inner tighs more than ya legs but its not good when you get on something thats hot!! used to own 1 13hh new forest was a looney with me but if ya put a child on her she wouldnt put a foot wrong has also been proved with my traditonal cob|`|Pn9tPYKbaa	idk, maybe its like something that make the horse have energy???  idk. but hope someone knows and will tell you:)|`|PEPWFGNGaa	Electric butt - lol.  Basically they ride with their back/butt as well as other aids.  It may not even be obvious to watchers but it is obvious to a horse who is sensitive to this type of riding.  These are the people who can get the lazy stubborn horses going with no apparent effort andf then end up with a problem on a "normal" horse.  Very often the people don't even know they are doing it.|`|hZ8NUU1Raa	Yeah i know what this means people call me it, it means the have a tendance to get on a horse and 'fizz it up' its justt the way she rides and the attitude she has that reflects on a horse.    Hope this helped :)
0Ei3ePJzaa	I have always wondered why cat owners are not forced to be more responsible for their pets.  Dogs after all would kill small animals, but, owners have trained and disciplined them not to.  Dogs would go in your garden if left to roam, but owners (or most of them) do not allow them to.  <br>  Cat owners seem to be allowed to throw their pets out of the door with the lame excuse of "well it's in the cats nature" but as you say, a lot of people keep ferrets, especially in the UK and they are not allowed to roam around.  If I had a large snake, I am sure it would be in it's nature to eat some rabbits, but I wouldn't set it loose to do just that in the neighbourhood.<br>  <br>  I think the trouble with releasing any captive animal in the hopes it will do what nature intended is that that animal has been bread for the soul purpose of being a pet.  Therefore to add that to the food chain is to deprive the land of valuable animal lives that contribute to it for wild creatures.  Ferrets are amazingly intelligent creatures, but can reap havoc on most small animals, so they are best restrained, but, I also feel domestic cats should be too.|`|rQlzfHqraa	We are in an upside down world. One can say we have gone a long way down the road. But I say we have gone a long way down the road. I 'm sorry to add that it's the wrong road. No pet should ever be free outdoors as it is always damaging to the indigenous species.|`|SmlzU8O1aa	Ferrets are hunters, very very good hunters. They can get into burrows/hiding places that cats cannot and excel at fighting in close spaces unlike cats. This is why ferrets are better hunters than cats.<br>  <br>  Also, cats are very popular with homeowners and are thought to be cute and safe (which they are not always). Cats are thought to be easier to look after (true or not).|`|UvhfYAHuaa	I've had ferrets and I had friends that would not come over or if they did I had to put the ferret cage in a spare room covered in a towel or blanket. Ferrets are highly misunderstood and have too many old wives tails about them. Yes ferrets are in the weasel family but they only resemble them in phycal paramaters. Weasel have very good eyesite where as ferrets are very near sighted and must be very close to some thing to see it clearly. Ferret movement is different that most 4 footed mamals. They have a bouncing kind of hop in which their front legs jump and they "pull" the rest of their body. We as human don't mind 4 leged creatures but anything that slithers,creaps, crawls or anything else we are afraid of. I agree with you that cats are a bigger problem than ferrets will ever be. Anyone can own a cat, where as to own a ferret you have to spend about $100 just for the animal which part of that cost goes to keeping the ferret population under control by having them fixed before purchase. I look at it like this if you live in the country and have a farm you need cats to keep your mice and rats under control. If you live in a crowed city you don't need to keep 30 cats in one tiny house. I think laws should be passed about the number of cats allowed per person/ family or per resedance. I mean if other country's provide "population control" for their people the least our goventment could invest some tax dollars into the problem of animal control instead of voteing themselves pay raises.|`|bepZupAfaa	when the ferret was introduced into the US it's soul purpose was the help the farmer get rid of his rodent problem. a ferret could get into places that a cat couldn't. unfortunately for the ferret not only did it get the rodent but it also got chickens and other small animals.<br>  <br>  over the years the ferret was domesticated but held onto it being a wild animal beliefs. now they are considered an exotic animal but still the wild animal aspect still lingers.<br>  <br>  some states in the US still ban them as pets because of the fear of them depleting the natural wildlife of that particular state. California and Hawaii are the two states that totally forbid ferrets in their states.other states may only ban them in certain cities or counties.<br>  <br>  although i disagree with the bans i understand where they are coming from. i own 5 ferrets and love them dearly and fortunately i live in a state where they are accepted.<br>  <br>  i also agree that cats/dogs can do more damage to the wildlife population than ferrets, but the thing is that most all the ferrets  in the US have are already been  neutered before you purchase one so they can't reproduce in the wild if they got loose or if their owners set them free. i do own a cat but she is neutered and is a house cat. also have 2 dogs and they are both fixed and remain in the house 90% of the time.<br>  <br>  a domesticated ferret would not be able to survive on its own.it has pretty much lost its ability to hunt for survival. it could not become a feral animal because of this either. oh sure there will probably be an exception to this but that would not happen like it does with dogs and cats. dogs tend to become pack animals. <br>  <br>  a lot of people are afraid of the ferret simply because of its looks. let face it a ferret does look a lot like a weasel. some think they look like a rat.others think they smell like a skunk. i think these are the main reasons for the fear of them.<br>  <br>  <br>  hope this helps
zMXDolD9aa	With your lack of options, i'd say lessons does seem like the only real choice.<br>  The price does seem about right, but it depends on what kind of stables yours is. My old one had a huge livery yard plus a riding school with two big arenas, one indoor and the other outdoor. The price for hour private lessons was something like ￡75. I had group hour lessons for around ￡25 and they did semi-private (about 2-3 people) at around ￡35. The prices at your stables look accurate.<br>  Maybe once you've built up experience you could consider part loaning/exercising someones horse one or two days a week, which is noticeably cheaper.|`|YdJgrgvdaa	well in my area at one stable i would pay ￡14.50, at another ￡14.10, these were for hour group lessons and at the monent i pay ￡20 for hour private lesson|`|NJdupXBKaa	I think that is about average to be honest. I have seen cheaper and more expensive ones. My riding school is ￡18 for an hour and ￡14 for half an hour in group lessons. Privates are ￡26 for and hour and ￡17 for half an hour. But if you hire a horse you pay a small fee. <br>  Maybe you should try typing in riding schools for your local area on google or ask around and see where other people ride. <br>  People can get livery for cheap. I get D.I.Y for ￡20 a week inc bedding and spend about a fiver a week on hay. But then there is feed, shoes, vets fees, insurance and so much more on top of that.<br>  Maybe have a few lessons and then look into getting a share horse.<br>  Good Luck with whatever you decide.<br>  xxx :)|`|SzW9GmRsaa	That sounds cheap ... it's not Lasswade, is it?!  Steer clear, run away, get out of there, etc etc etc.  Run for the hills, and never go back.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately yes it is very expensive for a weekly hobby.  The cost of keeping horses is increasing (feed and bedding prices have rocketed, and not just because of the economic situation) and insurance has been on the up for years - in fact the cost of insurance closed a few very good riding schools when the economy was booming.<br>  <br>  If you want I can recommend a few good places in the area (I lived in Edinburgh for over 30 years) although I don't know what they're charging.  I do know of a few people who are looking for riders/helpers in the area if you find yourself with some free time, too.|`|YRwDQTccaa	I used to go to Houston Farm and I think its ￡20 for a group lesson.(hour)  my instructor was jenna and was very good, the group size was quite small also|`|AA11036952	to me that is soooooooo expensive at a private livery that teaches lessons.|`|FtQ9ufiiaa	That seems steep to me!!<br>  <br>  I mean my stable fees for my horse (stable and grazing we have x country and flood light arena) is ￡22.50 a week!!!!<br>  <br>  Lessons around here are about ￡15.00 a hour (that is our instructor though who comes to our yard )  but I know the riding schools are about ￡20.00 but that for a hour private lesson  and others have a instructor who is ￡30.00 a hour!!!!!<br>  <br>  Maybe as you getting into it only have a 1/2 to start anyway you be aching after believe me (stopped for about 2 years)  lol<br>  <br>  Oh and I am in Bristol so its a city and the prices here are not cheap by any means<br>  <br>  any friends have a horse you can have a lesson on?? or a experienced person who would give you a lesson on there horse??<br>  <br>  good luck hope I helped keep looking I say for now<br>  xxxxxxxxx|`|uwrzB6Kzaa	i think they are about average price. ive seen some a bit cheaper around us but then there are more expensive ones too.<br>  <br>  you must have some cheap livery yards around you if you know people who can keep a horse for ￡22 - ￡24 a week.<br>  <br>  diy livery usually costs around ￡15 - ￡30 a week depending on where you live and what facilities the yard has.<br>  <br>  then there is hay, straw, hard feed, shoeing, worming and vaccinations.<br>  <br>  but regardless of that you are not just paying towards the cost of the horses keep but you are paying for the time of the riding instructor who will have spend many years training to get her qualifications to teach and her experience.<br>  <br>  even if you had time to offer your services to a riding instructor for free lessons or volunteer at stables for lessons i dont think they would be interested. they will have hundreds of offers of people offering to work for free in exchange for lessons.<br>  <br>  like people who become a working pupil. sometimes they get a small wage of ￡30 a week but sometimes they dont get paid anything and they have to work 10 hours a day, 6 days a week for the chance to work and learn about horses.|`|jUjkvis8aa	￡22 for a half-hour private lesson seems a bit pricey! At my stables it is ￡10 for a half-hour group (4+ people) lesson, ￡15 for a semi-private lesson (2-3) and ￡18 for a private half-hour one. <br>   Why don't you have one private lesson to begin with, then stick to cheaper group lessons? Or, if your birthday is coming up, why not ask for lessons as a present? And even better, if you have kids, you could ask them for riding lessons as a mother's day present!<br>  <br>  Just a few ideas :) Hope you start riding again soon.
AQsiugSpaa	Amanda!!!<br>  <br>  I am thrilled that you won the appeal. That is GREAT mews for folks who deplore the cruel and senseless practice of declawing.<br>  <br>  I am not that optimistic that the procedure will be banned in the United States anytime soon. Vets make far too much money in fees for the surgery which they frequently bundle into a package with neutering/spaying. But I can say that with more cat lovers becoming more educated about exactly what is entailed in the procedure  and the risks of behavioral and physical problems which often result from the amputation of the last digits of the paws, or even the "more human laser process", perhaps fewer people will request the surgery. I will bet my bottom dollar that most vets don't take the time to truly share all the facts, or to talk about alternatives to declawing. That is why I love my vet.. she does!  And she doesn't declaw.<br>  <br>  Additionally I think that many people are too scared or lazy to learn how to clip claws. It is a regular part of grooming cats, and has to be done every couple of weeks or so to be effective, and it takes time and effort, so it is far more convenient to whack the digit off. No more bother.. no more fuss. And some folks prefer their furniture to their cats. Funny thing, our furniture is in pristine condition. We have cat trees and posts in every room in our home. Offer a cat an alternative, and they generally will take it,if it is the right kind of post or tree.<br>  <br>  It saddens me totally... but even helping on Yahoo Answers to spread the truth how 25 countries around the world have banned the practice maybe more people will talk with their vets and try to get them to see the light. I might be naive but there is a part of me that is somewhat hopeful still.<br>  <br>  Thanks for your question, and helping. I did have a cat I adopted that was declawed years before she came to me. I think that the owner gave her up because she had developed a neurotic chewing habit. All our lampshades and window shades were marked with little teethmarks, and she would not let me touch her paws at all. So much for safe and no problem surgery.<br>  <br>  Troublesniffer<br>  Owned by cats for over 40 years<br>  Passionate about banning declawing in the USA|`|6be65543422b4937c27d1761a2ed50a0aa	I certainly HOPE SO.......but, I don't hold out a lot of hope for it.  In the US, people seem to think of their animals as "property", not as normal "feeling" beings.  <br>  <br>  In my opinion, animals are JUST as important as humans, and deserve all the respect that SHOULD come with that.  The only thing that I DO agree with, in the animals / humans "conflict of interest", is.......animals, when terminally ill CAN be "humanely" euthanized.  <br>  <br>  It's really too bad that this can't also be RESPECTFULLY performed for terminally ill people ( at their request )!  So many people suffer needlessly at the "end", because of the laws preventing "pulling the plug"!<br>  <br>  Sorry about the "soap box", but your question raised this other one for me, too..........<br>  <br>  The website that I always tell people about, when they ask about declawing / or not, is.......<br>  <br>  <a href="http://maxshouse.com/Truth%20About%20Declawing.htm" rel="nofollow">http://maxshouse.com/Truth%20About%20Dec...</a><br>  <br>  and I tell them to READ it, then "bookmark" if for future reference.......<br>  <br>  Hope you get some support for your ANTI-declawing forum.<br>  Good luck.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	It has been banned in some communities (just a few) and there are a number of vets that refuse to do it.  It will be one of those things where change will come slowly, but I think in time will be done as people become more aware. <br>  <br>  Spaying and neutering pets has come a long way in the last 20 years and many more people get their pets done.  Declawing will change too. In fact it is already done less frequently than it used to be.|`|AA11343198	I think so if Biden has something to do with it he is a animal lover.|`|IuYekkPVaa	Gizmo is beautiful and he is so lucky to have found himself a loving new home.<br>  <br>  I don't believe that cats should ever be declawed, but a lot of people seem to think it's okay to declaw a cat that never goes outside.  What about when natural disasters occur such as hurricane Katrina, or if they have a house fire?  How do declawed cats manage to climb to safety and protect themselves?<br>  <br>  According to figures from the HSUS, declawing generates a huge amount of income for some vets.   I would love to see declawing banned in both the US and Canada, but until it is, I think we need to educate people on the truth about de-toeing and encourage people to boycott the services of any vet who promotes or condones it.  Hitting them in their pockets is probably the best way to make them change their minds.|`|5xQESoC4aa	YES! Just ask the person how they would like there nails being ripped off of their hands, knowing they would never go back. The worst thing is seeing a cat trying to sharpen their nails knowing they don;t have any, it's terrible. If you buy a cat from I believe Pet's Mart they do not allow you to de-claw them.|`|A1iDPPOeaa	My cat, a 17 year old female was declawed when young and it saved her life.  She was very destructive and after replacing the SECOND couch the decision was made to declaw.  She is an indoor only cat, has no desire to go outside and does just fine.  She does not bite, neither before or after the declawing.<br>  <br>  While it's obviously not the most pleasant surgery for a cat, she survived it and is doing just fine, and has lived for 17 years because of it with us, rather than being placed or thrown outside as others might be likely to do when the animal is destroying property.|`|LBZPm5rgaa	YES!!!!  I think declawing your cat is cruel and should be banned.  they have claw caps that are safely glued to the nails so they will not scratch the furniture or you.  they even come in festive colors, even the holidays and when the nail grows they simply fall off .  Then all yoju have to do is reglue them.  Check you local pet store.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	I really hope so! The sooner the better, that's for sure. I bet it will be banned eventually, though. I think "anti-declawers" are making progress changing others' views.|`|TWsxP46Qaa	we had this problem in a massive scale a good few years back when the US military pulled out of the nuclear base at Faslane in Scotland,there where hundreds of de-clawed cats abandoned by their owners who didnt seem to care about the poor creatures welfare,most where lucky enough to be put down by local vets,but a good few of them starved to death or where horribly mutilated by clawed feline residents<br>  <br>  its time this practice was banned everywhere is inhumane to any cat regardless if its a house cat or not,cats will escape the home from time to time and as a creature of nature it must be able to defend itself<br>  <br>  <br>  oh by the way i hate cats,never ever liked them , would never have one as a pet,but they still have rights.|`|lPdCTyOAaa	To be precise, the US should not ban declawing.  That would be a violation of the Constitution.  Only individual states (or communities) have the power to do that.  (Never mind that both major parties seem to spend most of their time pissing all over the Constitution.)  <br>  <br>  I am more open to restrictions imposed by states and local governments, as they do have the power to regulate business.  And I am convinced that declawing is a cruel procedure.  <br>  <br>  That said, I am always reluctant to give the government power over yet one more area of our lives, no matter how well intentioned.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Just curious...are the thumbs down because of the last paragraph where I express reluctance (note, the word is "reluctance", not "absolute opposition") to giving in to more government power?  Fair enough...we all have different perspectives.<br>  <br>  Or do you dislike the fact that I think our government should obey the Constitution, in this case the 10th Amendment, even if it yields undesirable results?  If this is the case, I find your attitude very frightening indeed.|`|uoLrp5mnaa	I will NEVER declaw my cats! It's inhumane! All cats were born with claws, And for you people who care about furniture more than living creatures, GET A LIFE...<br>  <br>  <br>  I would only declaw a cat if it had a disease in its claws, like my best friend's cat had.<br>  <br>  :)|`|DtkLsetkaa	I hope it will, but I doubt it, at least not right now.  Its a profitable surgery to unscrupulous vets and they will fight that "its the owners preference" until the day they die so they can keep the money rolling in.  I really do hope so tho.<br>  <br>  "saved her life" because it stopped her from clawing a couch?  Please. Elaborate.  Because if thats the reason it "saved her life" you are an incredibly cruel person.
7WUvPI8maa	his activity that he's getting may not be enough anymore then it was before. it's possible your dogs nails grow quicker then normal. try walking him daily outside (pavement) because it helps to wear their nails down. good luck.|`|gU34xa9vaa	I'm of the old school of thought that the more you clip dog's nails, the faster they grow.We always had dogs when I was young and never clipped their nails, as we always took them on plenty of pavement walks as well as grassy places and that kept them right.|`|rpVQpJA7aa	This all has to do with his activity level. When he was younger, they probably stayed shorter because he was more active, and now with age, he isn't as active, so they grow lots more faster|`|rcQgfKPTaa	this is probabaly happening because he is becoming older and more active. sometimes that means a change in the growth of nails for dogs.<br>  <br>  hope this helped :)|`|aZi6BvBraa	The more you clip them, the more they grow.<br>  I have had dogs all my life and never clipped their nails. Just let them walk and the nails should weir.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	It's not that they are growing any faster, but he is not wearing them down with activity as much as he was when he was younger most likely. Think about his activity levels as compared to when he was younger.|`|N9pKl35Xaa	I think when dogs become older they do less of what they used to like digging etc because they grow out of it. Or older dog use to just lay around doing nothing and his nails were getting longer and longer than lately his been up running around and they've stopped growing as fast. The vet also said sometimes the healthy stuff in their foods actually make them grow faster too.. whether that has anything to do with it i dont know
JsBb732Maa	Great price, I got a used set up similar to yours and it was $100.00, so you did great. :-)|`|QikvnTnqaa	:0 WOAH! I wish I could find a tank that cheap!!! :D Yes, that's a great deal! Just the tank by its self (at a store with no heater/light/ect...) would be between $60-100!!!!|`|3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	15.00 or 150.00? lol...Either way, tank, stand, hood, and lights, good deal!

I do not have one myself, but I have a ball python and the next reptile that I get will probably be a beardie. I really like the second picture from the bottom.

B8hOqrENaa	Your right, people that think they can throw pets away like old garbage makes me sick. People if you don't want your pets anymore don't drop your pets off take them to an Animal Shelter or your local SPCA where they can find someone who will actually love them.|`|YV1bOajXaa	Did you actually see someone drop him off there in the parking lot?  I mean, if someone lost their pet he could go where ever he wanted including the Walmart parking lot.  If his ribs are showing, he hasn't been getting fed recently so he could be lost.  You should take him to the humane society to get scanned and see if he has a microchip.  There is a chance that he is a lost dog.|`|94ef238f7854b4c3d9896acaeb2179a1aa	ok first of all let me say thank God for people like you!  If more people would do the right thing this would be a thing of the past.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	Walmart in many places still allows people to give free puppies and kittens away in their parking lots - and these same people will often dump the animals that don't get taken by someone at the end of the day because the irresponsible owners don't bother to spay and neuter their animals or find proper homes for their pet's offspring.  A change in their policy to prohibit this activity would help a lot.<br>  <br>  Petsmart and Petco have the right idea - adoption days for local legitimate non-profit shelters instead of letting anyone with a box of kittens show up and hand them out.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	You hit the nail on the head.  People are ignorant.  Its really as simple as that.  I might add "heartless" into your vocabulary as well.  They grow tired of their pet, the pet doesn't do exactly what they want, they can no longer afford the pet..... the reasons are endless really.  In the long run though, just dumping the pet is the most ignorant, heartless thing a person can do.  Its pathetic.|`|yKS2UI87aa	I feel for you. I used to live in the country not to far from a shelter. We had at one time 11 dogs, 3 cats and 2 goats (3 dogs and the goats were mine) It is sad and depressing when people do these things. All I can think is why did you have the dog/cat in the first place. I also hate when the family just pitches the dogs in the backyard never to be let in again. They should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. I encourage you to write down the license plates and any helpful info and call the police or dog warden. Thank God you are a respectful and decent human with feelings that does something about it.|`|d5781f30069ecf14d7c481d2dc40aec7aa	Good for you for taking care of the dog. I am assuming you had him checked for a chip so you can be sure he was abandoned not lost. People are HORRIBLE. I will never understand how they can treat another living creature as disposable.|`|T1Si1yvlaa	Take that animal to the vet. It can have an infection or a disease that could spread to you (Like mites which aren't visible until serious) or to your other animals. Take that dog to the vet immediately.<br>  <br>  I wasn't aware that things like this happen and I am absolutely shocked. We need more people like you to help rescue animals and even if we don't take them into our own homes with as much generosity as you, at least get them the help they need. I appreciate what you did for that animal and you had every good intention, i can tell you have a beautiful heart.<br>  <br>  So just take that dog to the vet, and you can probably get it adopted and named if you want. This story is sad, but you did the right thing.|`|XumFHbn8aa	Did you actually see someone drop him off there in the parking lot?

AA12126470	Be ready to train with the dog from day one.<br>  They need lots of training. Set rules and stick  to them always.<br>  They need rules and you have to be firm and stick to the rules you set. <br>  Consistency is very important with Dobermans.<br>  Also be prepared to be the leader and the one in charge. If you are not the top dog the puppy will try and take that roll and you will have problems you can not even imagine.<br>  Get into a training class as soon as you can and stick with them. It is great for socialization and helps you to learn how to work with the dog. It provides distractions for the dog and it will learn to look to you for guidance.<br>  Dog proof the house. Get a crate. <br>  Be ready to be on the go for the next two years. They are very active dogs.<br>  I have had the breed for 20 years.|`|jZGg0gNKaa	Get a puppy, people are going to tell you go rescue but we've always had a lot of trouble with adopting an older Dobe. Enroll in a puppy kindergarten as soon as it's available to you. Socialize him early to everything you can. Make sure you find a good reputable breeder who will have mom and dad on site and they were cleared of any medical problems. Some places do not accept Dobermans so be prepared to look around for kennels, groomers, and even different airlines. Talk to your breeder as well, all good breeders are always happy to help you with the breed they know and love.|`|aZi6BvBraa	I have a rescue dobie and would advise you not to get a rescue dobermann if you have no experience with the breed. Get your dog form a reputable breeder, that keeps their own dogs as family pets in the house, so they would know their character. You say you used to own a German Sheperd, they are not the same. GSD's are much more relaxed than Dobies. A dobie has the energy of a terrier.<br>  The fact that you have a backyard doesnt really say much, dont just leave in in the garden. take it out for walks so it gets used to meeting other people and dogs. Socialise it well and do so as soon as you get it.<br>  If you have a family, make sure everybody will treat the dog the same. Be consequent with your rules! Its not mean to be straight with a puppy. Set clear boundaries, treat him as if he is an adult dog. i.e. dont allow him on the sofa when he is a pup, if you wouldnt want him on there when he grows up.<br>  Be firm, but gentle!|`|Z5GxEDi6aa	Hiya I have been brought up with Dobermans and they are good family dogs, very loving and affectionate and will protect if necessary.<br>  <br>  They are known to be boisterous and hard to train, but as you have had experience with a GSD a lot of time you will be fine. Get the puppy meeting with different people and dogs as early as possible, my mums current doby had awfull kennel cough and other problems shortly after we got him and so we didn't get to take him to obidience classes til quite late on, and he was so naughty with other dogs jumping on them and stuff! He is fine with them now though, really good with my dog.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and Good choice!xxx|`|N9pKl35Xaa	We dont own one but our next door neighbour got a doberman the same time we got our Rotty pup and they pretty much grew up together, i used to just walk into his backyard get his dog and bring it over to my place, so i kinda had experience with one!<br>  <br>  But watching my neighbour with the dog, he was good he took him everywhere he went but the one thing he never down was train him around other people and the dog jumped on people ran around people 100miles and hour almost knocking a full grown man on his *** and he also never took it for vet check ups, thats when play time between our dog and his dog pretty much ended!  But that dog was friendly as all hell just a complete mental case when vistors were around. <br>  <br>  I say just train it the same as you would any other dog, bring it up right you'll have a fine dog. You have the time, you have the place you should be ok. Oh and also like ^ said, look for good breeders if your going for a pup. Last thing you want is a dodgy breeder and unknown blood line
uBFhKXgHaa	Not all pet food is made equally. A lot of it is full of corn, by-products, dyes, unhealthy preservatives, filler grains and all sorts of nasty stuff. A lot of pet food companies are perfectly happy to the dump cheap leftovers and things that aren't safe for human consumption (from human food processing plants) into their foods. Will it kill your dog? No, it has to be nutritionally complete and safe to even be marketed. Is it healthy? Not by a long shot.     Corn is a low quality ingredient you never want to see in your pet food. Corn and low quality grains are two of the biggest culprits when it comes to food allergies in our pets.    Thankfully, there are some excellent dog foods being made these days that include organic, human grade ingredients rather than trash not fit for human consumption.    Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Pedigree, Kibbles n' Bits, Beneful, Ol'Roy.    Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Canidae All Life Stages, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timberwolf Organics.    Although the high quality foods are more expensive, you're getting what you're paying for. Less filler material means more concentrated nutrients... this means you typically need to feed far less of the high quality food than you would of the low quality one. Which also means less poop!    Seriously on a budget? Two of the most affordable of the higher quality foods would be Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul and Canidae All Life Stages.    Before following your vet's food recommendation, keep in mind that vets get /very/ little nutritional training during their schooling. Besides that, what training they /do/ get is usually sponsored or taught by the crappy pet food companies! They also often get paid to sell some of their products at their clinics (Science Diet, Royal Canin etc.)    A great option is to go with an entirely grainless diet. Many of the high quality foods now put out grainless formulas. Some good grainless diets include: Innova EVO, Wellness CORE, Blue Wilderness, Nature's Variety Instinct, Orijen, Horizon Legacy, Merrick Before Grain, Canidae Grain Free All Life Stages, Fromm Surf & Turf, Now!, Sold Gold Barking At The Moon, Ziwipeak, and Taste of the Wild.    Some pretty decent foods can even be found in common pet stores. Petsmart carries Blue Buffalo products (such as the excellent grain free diet Blue Wilderness). Petco carries Wellness, Solid Gold, Natural Balance, Eagle Pack Holistic Select, Blue Buffalo, Castor & Pollux Organix, Pinnacle, and Halo.     If you can't find a food, most of the high quality dog food brands have websites with store locators on them that will help you find the store closest to you which supplies their products. Simply type the dog food brand's name into Google, go to their website, and type your zip code into their store locator.    Another option, if you can't find anywhere around you that sells good foods, is to order your pet food online. Here's an excellent place to do so: http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/    Remember that foods should be switched gradually (mixing the new slowly in with the old over the period of about week or so), especially when switching to a higher quality one, so as not to upset tummies. For example:  Days 1 & 2: 75% old food, 25% new food  Days 3 & 4: 50% old food, 50% new food  Days 5 & 6: 25% old food, 75% new food  Day 7: 0% old food, 100% new food    Another option for feeding dogs is to feed raw. This is something that should be thoroughly researched before being attempted:  http://www.rawfed.com/ (Excellent raw feeding information)  http://www.rawlearning.com/ (More excellent raw feeding information)  http://rawfeddogs.net/ (Even more!)  http://rawfed.com/myths/preymodel.html (Raw Prey Model Diet Vs.

It is worth it to buy a higher priced dog food with quality ingredients.  In addition to the health benefits, dogs also require less food when it is high quality as they're just not filling up on junk yellow corn, and they will poop less because corn just goes right through them and makes more waste!    At big pet stores (Petco, Petsmart, etc.) they have an aisle of natural foods (the good kind with good ingredients), specialty/vet foods (like Science diet, for dogs who need something particular for allergies, etc.), and junk foods (purina, Iams, Kibbles n Bits, etc. - aka: corn)|`|P3WPiEVPaa	I use Eukanuba for my large breed dog and Wellness for my small breed dogs. I do not buy anything from Wal-Mart as the foods there (yes even purina) are just fullers and filled with things that do not give your animals the proper nutrition. If that is all you can afford that fine, food at all is better than none, but if you can afford to give your animals the better stuff then I recommend one of these two. Science Death is not good at all, most vets only have it because they get it at a discounted rated.
AA11901352	First off your tank is not over stocked.  Really you should stick with the cooler water species here.  Although there are many warmer water fish that could be added unless you monitor the water temperature around 75-78 it is going to be a rough decision.  You didn't say what kid of goldie you have.  Is he a fancy?  What is your water temperature now?  Sticking with the cooler water species you have a number of fish you can choose from.<br>  <br>  Barbs - Several readily available species of Barbs are tolerant of temperatures in the sixties, or even lower. easy to care for,  suitable for a community aquarium. These are:  Rosy Barb (Barbus conchonius) Gold Barb (Barbus schuberti),  Green Barb (Barbus semifasciolatus), Two Spot Barb (Barbus ticto).<br>  Bloodfin Tetra - Both the standard Bloodfin (Aphyocharax anisitsi), and the False Bloodfin (Aphyocharax dentatus) tolerate temperatures in themid sixties.  are easy to care for, and are quite hardy. <br>  Blind Cave fish (Astyanax fasciatus mexicianas) Does well in temperatures of 64-77 and is a peacefull community fish<br>  Buenos Aires Tetra (Hemigrammus caudovittatus) -  they do well with temperatures mid sixties. Standard varietiesand albinos  <br>  Croaking Tetra (Coelurichthys microlepis) - easy to care for and are suitable for community tanks.<br>  Guppy (Poecilia reticulata) - many attractive variations<br>   Hillstream Loach es -  Not all of them like cool temperatures, but do well with temperatures in the upper sixties.<br>  Hypostomus plecostomus – pleco, common pleco, janitor fish, hearty even salt tolerant up to brackish water, also prefers cooler water under 76 degrees.<br>  Native Fish - A variety of North American native fish . Virtually all of them tolerate cool water. Availability varies from state to state, as do laws regarding which species may be legally kept in home aquariums. Keep in mind that some will become too large to keep in a standard aquarium.<br>  Pearl Danio (Brachydanio albolineatus) - Like the zebra danio, this fish is very hardy and easy to care for. It will tolerate temperatures into the mid 60's without difficulty, and is easy to find. They are larger than zebras, but need not be kept in schools.<br>  Weather Loach (Misgurnus angullicaudatus) Can do well with temps in the fifties, and it makes an excellent candidate for a coldwater tank.<br>  Wimple (Myxocyprinus asiaticus) Freshwater Batfish. This is a unique fish to have. mid sixties.<br>  White Cloud Mountain Minnow (Tanichtys albonubes) - Easy fish to care for.<br>  Zebra Danio (Brachydanio rerio)  mid sixties, and are very easy to care for. Long finned species are available, as well as a popular leopard spotted variety.<br>  Rainbow Darter, Etheostoma caeruleum grows about 4 inches kept under 77 degrees feeds on algae.<br>  Northern Redbelly Dacer, good under 75 degrees and a good algae eater grows around <br>  Bullhead, Cottus gobio great bottom dweller and algae eater under 77 degrees<br>  <br>  <br>  Although you cannot keep all of these in the tank there are just a few types you can keep.  Remember other fancy goldfish also work.  I would steer clear of the koi, common goldfish or even the comets|`|igpMQn0kaa	You mean you got the tank, put water in, then added the fish?

It's going to either be too hot for the goldfish or too cold for the tropicals. The algae eater is probably a common pleco that grows two feet and far outgrows your tank. The kissing fish, also known as kissing gouramis, get huge too. Danios need to be in groups.<br>  <br>  Any fish can be hardy as long as you've cycled properly. Research a bit about cycling and proper schools/shoals, along with the adult size of fish before you get them. The only reason fish may not get bigger in a small tank is stunting.<br>  <br>  Fish Stunting:<br>  <a href="http://freshwater.fanatics.googlepages.com/fishstunting" rel="nofollow">http://freshwater.fanatics.googlepages.c...</a>|`|Vi8RDbhUaa	I would get rid of your goldfish.

They are all about 2 years old now.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Your tank is overstocked and incorrectly stocked as well. All fish have space requirements based on activity, adult size, and waste output. Judging by these, your tank is overstocked. <br>  You need to choose either tropical or coldwater.<br>  <br>  1. The goldfish is a coldwater fish. Temperatures higher than 75 are detrimental, and will shorten their naturally long lifespan. <br>  A single fancy goldfish requires twenty gallons, and a single common goldfish requires 55 gallons for a good reason. That space allows them to grow to their potential and the massive amount of waste they produce won't poison them with an efficient filter, and regular water changes. <br>  I suggest returning or rehoming him.<br>  <br>  2. Assuming your kissers are kissing gouramis they should have at least a 55 gallon aquarium, and they do grow fairly large. They are also semi-aggressive, and really should not be housed with goldfish, or tropical community fish. I also recommend finding new homes for these fish.<br>  <br>  3. The mollies are actually the correct size for this tank. Though they greatly benefit from brackish conditions, your other fish won't.<br>  <br>  4. A single danio. They are schooling fish and do best in groups of at least six.<br>  <br>  5. Algae eater is very vague. Could you narrow it down please?<br>  <br>  ~If you found new homes for the goldfish and the gouramis you could have a strictly tropical community tank.|`|BIeBuK3naa	The easiest for me are goldfishes. It is always told that if you take care of them properly, they live for many years. I also think that goes the same with all kinds of fish. Your tank would be overstocked after some time.

Most goldfish (especially comets, or feeders) will get too large for your 29.... they also should NEVER be kept with tropicals..

Most species of plecostomas are also to large for your tank.<br>  <br>  <br>  Provide us with some more information, but I think you'll need to get rid of at least four fish before you can get more.<br>  <br>  <br>  ==========<br>  Do not get a red belly pacu... those guys need a 125 gallon tank.  they get HUGE.|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	It doesn't look overstocked now because you have baby fish. The Goldfish, presuming fancies, should get a good 6"-8" excluding fins. While those "Kissers", aka Kissing Gouramis, should get 12" long excluding fins. Put a ruler next to your tank and you'll see why people are saying you're overstocked!!<br>  <br>  What kind of "algae eater" do you have? That little phrase can be applied to dozens upon dozens of fish. Some of which do entirely the opposite such as the Chinese Algae Eater which will get to around 6"-8" and turn predatory, they're known for making small fish disappear and picking out the eyeballs of larger fish. Indeed any suckermouth fish can turn to this kind of activity if they're not provided with enough food.<br>  <br>  With a Goldfish, these fish are really best in Goldfish only tanks and NOT with other fish. Not to mention the temperature issues you will experience. A Goldfish in warm water will have a much faster metabolism, leading to stress, susceptibility to diseases and a shorter lifespan. Goldfish may also eat smaller fish once they grow.<br>  <br>  I would suggest you do some research on true fish needs and gain a better understanding of why people are saying your tank is badly stocked.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.theaquarumwiki.com/Goldfish" rel="nofollow">http://www.theaquarumwiki.com/Goldfish</a><br>  <a href="http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Kissing_gourami" rel="nofollow">http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Kissing_g...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Poecilia_sphenops" rel="nofollow">http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Poecilia_...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Zebra_Danio" rel="nofollow">http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Zebra_Dan...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/CAE" rel="nofollow">http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/CAE</a>|`|a2cjwMKcaa	The longest lived fish are usually larger species. Kissing gourami - 10years Goldfish 10-20 yrs - Algae eaters, 10-30 depending on the type.<br>  <br>  But to do this you need a suitable tank that can house foot long fish. This is what people mean about your tank being overstocked. It's not right now, but it will be in the future as your fish grow.<br>  <br>  So if you want your fish to be easy care and live a long time, you need the correcty size tank for them. Otherwise the fish grow, you have to work much harder to maintain the water quality and eventually they become stunted and die prematurely no matter what you do.<br>  <br>  Ian
rXnPcMGhaa	no, let nature take its course. do not try to interfere at all. enjoy the experience and watch the babies grow,ride on the backs of the parents etc. soon in several weeks they will begin to eat the same food as the parents. if you don't want the babies i will be more than happy to take them off of your hands. its a wonderful thing to watch them grow,and if they are healthy and live its only a plus. the parents may be very protective so don't handle the babies for two weeks or until their eyes open. after their eyes open keep them in your shirt pocket for several hours a day as they sleep and this will help them to become tame and use to you handling them .  good luck.  i had 13 of them but two recently died. best pets in the world.
rrLHU6ehaa	1.  Even a 5 gallon is too small.  Minimum size would be a 10 gallon long.    2.  Although small, danios are very active and a long shallow tank is best for them.  Especially if breeding.    Once the tank is set up, with marbles for the eggs to fall between, place ripe female and 2 healthy males into the tank.  It's okay to have some plants, like Java fern, for the fish to swim through.  Another reason for a shallow tank is so the eggs will fall between the marbles before they can be eaten.  Since the adults can't get to the eggs, leave them alone for 3-4 days, then remove.  The eggs will hatch in 3-5 days, then feeding needs to begin when the fry are free-swimming.  See following site for additional info.|`|2wmP1807aa	You must use a .25 liter tank. Put two zebra danio in there and they'll be right on each other. They won't have a choice but to mate. Hope that helped!!|`|lhmsAlQuaa	Where the hec did you get a Zebra!!!! sorry but i have no idea al edit if i can find some info   PS. what does a thumbs up do? does it give us pionts|`|0c5e60ce4b8fdd00c644bddf68b7f9caaa	To do this right you should go purchase an inexpensive book or two. You'll never get all of the answers you need on a forum such as this.  All that being said ,here goes. First off you don't breed Danios in pairs,they are group spawners,two or three ripe females to 4 or 5 mature males. Next,the tank should be approximately the size of a 10 gallon,but with only 6 inches of water. The bottom should be covered with a double or triple layer of marbles(cheap glass ones are fine). The marbles and shallow water are needed because of the fish's habit of eating their eggs as they fall to the bottom of the tank and then picking off the ones they can reach on the bottom after spawning. Condition the fish in a separate well filtered well planted tank. Have the spawning tank prepared and cycled and when you see lots of "chasing behavior"place your spawners in the breeding tank. They should spawn early next morning. Remove the parent fish in the afternoon when the spawning has ceased. That's how you get fertile eggs. The eggs hatch in 3 or 4 days and the fry appear to be tiny tiny slivers of glass among the marbles,very difficult to see. In a couple more days the fry absorb their egg sac and become free swimming. This is the day you realize that you should have started an infusoria culture two weeks earlier. If you waited 'til now you'll have to watch the fry starve to death while you attempt to feed them all manner of foods that are too large. Fry as small as Danios or Bettas really require the live,microscopic plants and animals in infusoria cultures to put on the first growth spurt that makes them large enough to consume other foods. They only require it for a short time (2 weeks,most) but it is invaluable at that time. Of course the spawning tank can only be served by a gently air driven sponge filter that was well seasoned(cycled) for 5 or 6 weeks in a fully seasoned tank. It should either be in a room having a constant 75 F temperature or in a tank provided with a correctly sized heater.  There's lots more,like using Methylene Blue to prevent fungused eggs,and the frequency of water changes while feeding infusoria.As you can see there's a lot more to learn,buy a book. Try Barron's Publishing "Aquarium Fish Breeding" by Schuermann, ISBN 0-8120-4474-6. It's not too expensive (I paid $8.95 US).
rrLHU6ehaa	You need to get some fish that will keep the guppy population down.  A pair of convicts or Jack Dempseys would do a great job.  Of course, it depends on what you consider large.  Yes, it could.  It depends on the other species.  And how well you keep up on maintenance.|`|tShDXmgbaa	no. I have a 55 gallon stocked with guppies and fry,swordtails and fry and platies and fry.|`|mpJsO0O9aa	Absolutely. Stress is a killer for a reason; would you want to do the dance of love with a bunch of other fish crowding around you? I think not. It's also not healthy if the tank is overfilled with guppies, as you are stressing the biological filtration of your tank. I would give away the females on Freecycle or to your local pet store and keep only the males so you can enjoy the beauty of the guppies and your other fish.
Sd4IfH2faa	If you piss them off, (picking it up when it doesn't want to be, leaving them alone without handling for too long, hurting it somehow, force feeding it) it will start becoming aggressive, but with proper care and handling, its very hardy. ($50 for the 50g tank, substrate, branches, hides, thermo, hygro, and lighting? i don't think so >.> and for 2? make sure ones a male, the others a female.) you know theres another fun pet called a leopard gecko, its even easier to care for, just a suggestion, hoped this helped =D
SQ39aHSoaa	Two walks a day is good.  If you are pressed for time in the morning then just let him out to do his business or maybe a very short walk.  Then do a longer walk in  evening.

And once before you put him to bed.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	He should be going outside to relieve himself several times a day.  Every few hours is pretty common for a one year old pup.  As for an actual long walk, that's more for exercise than potty purposes.  He should have one general area where he relieves himself not far from your home (the back yard, side yard or front yard), then the walk is just a reward and some exercise.  At least one good long walk a day is all that's absolutely necessary.  Just as long as he's getting plenty of other exercise throughout the day.<br>  <br>  *I don't really think there's such a thing as letting a dog out "too much".  As long as he's not having any accidents inside, then you are doing what needs to be done.  Trust your instincts.  You'll know when your dog needs to go.  Again, every few hours is pretty common for a 1 year old.  They should have pretty good bladder control by then.  Unless of course he just got done running around and drank tons of water.  lol  They may need to go out about 30 minutes later.  Same for food.  As long as you are letting him out about 30 minutes after he eats, then he's most likely fine for another couple hours or so.|`|Cg2OdQ0xaa	that's a tough one. that breed needs a lot of excercise.  So, I guess if you'll be gone an extended period of time - have someone let the dog out.  They need exercise or they can become destructive.  hope that helps!|`|5xQESoC4aa	You could just let him outside, you don't always have to walk him to let him do his Business.|`|2vz59utAaa	I take my dog out 6 times a day.
B6zl0AJDaa	If a horse can get near those "trees" you may want to rethink that.  I had some nice vases with "faux" plants in them and thought they were out of reach, they weren't!    You also may want to pave your feed room too!  Keeps the bugs and mice down that way.|`|iiNAJfGCaa	If you haven't built the barn yet, try to do the stalls in finished wood... that way you can shine them up very easily with murphy's oil soap for a polished look. Dutch doors always add a touch of class to any barn. Anne Kursinksi has beautiful framed photographs of her horses on the barn aisle (blown up size) and they're breathtaking. Just remember that a neat barn is a pretty barn. =)|`|Pn9tPYKbaa	do something with a horse them to it :)  idk, im not a barn decorater, so idk what to do lol  my barn in simple, a dirt floor, but idk. if i was a barn decoarter, then i would so a color theme like red and white, i know very simple, but that is what i would do, or maybe gold and black. idk, hope you have fun decorating:)|`|i25ZcHnbaa	I would pick a nice color paint like white and maybe a soft green or whatever color you like. I would reccomend box stalls with finished wood and painted grilled bars.|`|0kh2HEFMaa	You might want to line the top edge of each of the box stalls with some sort of hard rubber or metal in case you have a horse that cribs. I would have half doors so they can look out and see whats going on, this way they dont get too freaked out if they have to be inside for a while. I would also put hooks with cross ties down the isle. And make sure your feed room is secure just in case one gets out and thinks they want to go eat all the grain (not good!) Also have nice saddle stands in the tack room, along with hooks to hang bridles/halters/leads. Also put hooks inside the stalls for water buckets. Pavers in the grain room would be nice, as would a seperate wash stall with a drain in the floor. As for the outside, put dormers on the roof (look like this: http://www.infohorse.com/images/crocetop... use nice coordinating colors, and keep it unique!
45N6tmWraa	It is true that bilirubinuria is not a normal finding for cats, unlike some other species.  But it may not be too serious.  If Wilson is eating and drinking well, fatty liver disease is very unlikely.  Wait to see what the findings on the bloodwork are, and try not to worry too much until you know more.  Best of luck to you and your kitty.

84558de0349fa374ed3605ac33e8e36daa	I totally agree with linze2go's answer. You shouldn't let him sleep in your bed. Our dogs don't sleep in our bed but they love us. My husband and I both spend a lot of time exercising them and playing with them. Our girl tends to prefer my husband. i.e. she will run to him before me if we both call her. But she is also very protective and seems to be more protective over me. So I guess my husband and I both have a different relationship to our dogs but they are both strong realtionships. The important part is that you treat your dog right. <br>  Don't force him to "love you". Respect him and he will respect you!|`|MGAmNxddaa	Become his pack leader.YOU,have to become ALPHA....feed him,train him,play with him......do not allow him to run over top of you.Ask others in your family to allow you to be the only one to feed him and let him outside.You must be 100% responsible for him...|`|bnJLKQWMaa	I don't suggest you have a dog sleep with you to get you 'closer' that is not a good idea.  If you walk the dog, play with it, train it and feed it on a regular basis, you will become the focus of his life.  I don't ever suggest 'free feeding' if you feed your dog twice a day which is what most people suggest, make the dog sit before giving him the food.<br>  <br>  The more you want the dog to focus on you, the more positive things you focus on him will help.  Walking is one of the best bonding ways with your dog, playing ball in the yard and training obedience, he will recognize you as the master.<br>  <br>  Good luck and no sleeping on the beds for dogs, just gives you a hairy bed and no rules for the dog!|`|jZGg0gNKaa	If you want to be the one most involved in your dogs life bond with him. Do this by exercising the dog, feeding, training, and walking him. Take responsibility of him. Create a routine for the dog. Dogs love a leader.|`|e6deb12b2a198fe4e6c1925ada7b1eb5aa	Be his main caretaker as per food and water and walks, bathroom duties and play.  Make sure you treat him the best of anybody and spend lots of time with him.  Be kind and gentle and patient.  Use his name a lot but never to scold him.|`|AA10459818	dogs generally go to whoever treats them best, pet it take it on walks play with it, throw toys for it.  If you never take it for walks and such it wont be as loyal to you as other members|`|sRcKPzQ0aa	Dogs dont have favourites, they are just more inclined to follow the pack leader. Humans see it as them having a favourite really they just have the need to be balanced and part of a pack, become the pack leader and your dog will ''favour'' you. <br>  Walking with your dog is the best way to become at one with your dog. :-)
SmlzU8O1aa	Because the 'meat' or 'cheecks' of the bottocks cover our anus to help prevent infection or parasites. However, this has the unpleasant side-effect of excrement hitting it on the way out of the anus. Dogs have hair and a tail to do the job our buttocks can do, so their excrement only hits a little hair on it's way out. This is later cleaned.|`|zrdTHa4Waa	Because they don't have hands to do it so they use their tongues|`|rQlzfHqraa	Our animals are fed a balanced diet and we humans don't even know what is the best and balanced diet for us. We have studied diets for cattle, chickens and many others and they get what is needed. If we eat mostly veggies and a limited amount of fruits with plenty of water we wouldn't need a wipe either.|`|8395f464f951baf847594ae5b8585b9aaa	dogs drag there butts|`|nMe35c9Aaa	dogs do wipe just do it with there tongue, except for my brother pit bull he has to much muscles and can't reach so we have to wipe for him, ya i know yucky!!|`|4njcFBNhaa	My Grandma does to her pampered poodle!! <br>  <br>  I guess you must be really bored to ponder this... :o)|`|16e730ba39930a9906b368149bb74bbfaa	Dogs don't have ***-cheeks like we do|`|Fw0Zwds7aa	because they are dogs...
LGARG2zAaa	Check it out thoroughly first.  Arrange to meet and try the horse out.  If you and the horse get along, try to set up a trial period, say 1 month, where you can cancel your agreement if it doesn't work out.    Or, do what I do- I'm leasing one of my horses to a person, and our contract says that either of us can cancel the lease at any time for any reason.  The only stipulation is that if I cancel, I have to allow her to finish her current month, or give her back part of her money.  If she cancels, she gets to finish the current month she's paid up for, she doesn't have the option to get any money back if she chooses to cancel the agreement.    Unless you're thinking of signing a long-term agreement, then trying ti out for a month won't be a big risk.    Oh, and don't pay any attention to folks who say thoroughbreds are bad, spooky, high-strung, whatever.  It all depends on the individual horse- I've known very calm, friendly, sane, and easy-to-ride thoroughbreds.      What do you have to lose?  :)|`|QTT9380Yaa	i would try her out first  it cant hurt|`|9UttDvcsaa	I would try her out. TBs get a bad rap sometimes because they are taken off of the track and pushed to hard and expected to know too much.   TBs are generally not hot horses and have good minds.  I would rather train a TB than some of the little fireball quarter horses out there anyday.  They are sane, intelligent and willing.  Give her a chance.  If she is putting up with a complete beginner she is probably a great horse, I mean he obviously keeps riding her and he is still alive.  Good Luck!|`|An2AopAqaa	TB are very temperamental and I'd steer well clear of them. They also need heaps of feed and hayledge in winter to keep weight on so, depending on what kind of loan agreement this is, it may cost you a fortune.     If you aleady have a loan horse which you are happy with, can ride regular and you get on well with the owners then I would just stick with it. If you give him up then it doesn;t work out with the TB for one reason or another you will regret it. Your loan cob may get loaned to someone else you you won't be able to loan him anymore.

9kTejB0uaa	I don't normally do links these days, but given the subject, I just had to look.  Well is this photo meant to be of a puppy, or of an adult - looking at the teats, one might feel this is 'mum'?<br>  <br>  Whatever, this is just outrageous!!<br>  <br>  I had a friend who's husband suggested she start this (her's were on the small size in any case - lol) but indeed, what on earth is this person doing.  Actually given the asking price (￡160? - strange figure), obviously she's not about to make money because Bassets these days normally go for ￡700 and up well into 4 figures for a good brood b itch (adult).<br>  <br>  I'm amazed they are breeding true, even after how-many generations?  Bassets were a man-made breed originally, bred from the St.Hubertus hound which had long legs (same route as the Bloodhound).  They were bred down (legs) so they could be followed on foot rather than on horseback.<br>  <br>  I must investigate this further ..................<br>  <br>  Edit - I have emailed this seller and they say the puppy (or puppies, half the time it's one, and then they say 'them') and their cost is ￡165. - ￡160 in the advert. I've asked for a pedigree or the name of the sire and dam but so far, no pedigree, despite them/her? apparently being KC registered.  I'm still 'chatting'.<br>  Oh and ta for the thumbs down...... words fail.|`|eDySIDPQaa	You are so right, miniature this and that, and yes the day is coming, I sure hate to see Min.

I was speechless!<br>  <br>  If people want a small dog then they should look at the small breeds <br>  To miniaturise larger breeds is wrong.  There are plenty of breeds already existing that should meet everyones criteria - no reason to create new breeds!  As for those who want teacups - don't get me started!!|`|Hwybmzg5aa	which one am i supposed to click on this link is weird.well getting back to the subject i think this is actually ridiculous mini bassets that's bull.i think you should Phone them them to tell them what you think of them breeding designer mutts.|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	I'm still in shock from seeing people inquire about "mini retrievers."

Is getting ridiculous frankly. next we are going to have mini rotties. I think the main problem is the people who buy these dogs. They walk around with these mini dogs in their shirts and purses showing them off to everyone.|`|Dkb2ZR3Daa	Unfortunately, I work in a vet clinic and have seen ever mini/doodle/other mix with a fancy name you could imagine.... <br>  People will do anything now a days to make extra money-They scam people who poorly research the breed, where they are coming from, mills, BYB, etc. <br>  I think society should start publicizing, EVEN more, about puppy mills and designer breeds, and people need to start going to shelters where than can find another mutt-give it there own fancy name and help with the overpopulation of dogs.. and cats for that matter(cats are being crossed as well)<br>  <br>  Side note...We had a girl about my age, I'm 20, who came into the clinic to pick her dog up and wanted us to change the breed on her papers because it was wrong...It said lab mix.. and her dog wasn't a lab mix but a Laberdoodle... I wanted to say something to her so bad, but fortunately the receptionist kindly told her that its a mutt. She was pretty upset...<br>  <br>  Bad breeding is to blame for minis even being made in the first place. People poorly breed them too small and that has allowed irresponsible breeders to now profit off that.. They breed two small dogs until they get desired size.. People also don't realize most of the time this happens from interbreeding..<br>  If people did one ounce of research on mini or poo's or doodles they would realize the amount of health and temperament problems they come with. <br>  <br>  So I think irresponsible breeders and poorly educated people are both to blame....<br>  I think economy plays a factor as well. Now that more people are living in apartments or renting they need small dogs, but they don't want "sissy" looking dogs so they buy a mini retriever or mini golden it's ridiculous.
pYF9KnNeaa	I'm really sorry to hear you and your bird are going through this.  I am going to assume, since you used the term "Idiopathic", that your bird has already been tested for all the possible causes of the seizures.  If not, or if you are not sure, first off, be sure you are working with a very good Avian Vet with a lot of experience.  Keep in mind, a second opinion is always a good thing also.  Be sure she has been tested for central nervous system diseases, a brain tumor or infection, head trauma, inherited predisposition, hyperthermia, liver disease, metabolic diseases (hypocalcaemia, hyperglycemia); toxicity from lead, zinc, aflatoxins and certain insecticides.  A baseline complete blood count and chemistry (CBC) will show whether anemia, inflammation or infection is present. Blood chemistries provide an indication of liver and kidney function and the electrolyte status of the patient. They need to test for certain infectious diseases, such as chlamydia, polyoma and proventricular dilatation (PDD).  Make sure she has been tested for Pacheco's Disease.  I'm sure I'm not covering every possible cause but just trying to make sure you are working with a vet show has tried to eliminate all the known, usual causes of seizures.  Obviously this can be a long, drawn out process.  Medication to control idiopathic seizure should always be the last resort and usually Diazepam (valium) is used to temporarily stop the seizures.   If she should be<br>  diagnosed with epilepsy, she may be maintained on Phenobarbital to control and, hopefully, eliminate her seizures.  The hardest part of your question is about her reaction to the meds, possible personality change, etc., I doubt even your vet can predict with any accuracy.  They each will react differently, depending on many factors.  I have heard everything from, "he didn't seem to react at all", to "he has become a zombie".  All you can do, if it come to that, is to start out with the lowest dose possible, and monitor her very closely.  I wish I could be more helpful.  Best of luck to you with this really difficult situation.
Cfk1kr8Daa	Have his thyroid checked - if he has been doing well up til now on the same food, it probably isn't an allergy - although that doesn't necessarily mean he's having a good time trying to digest his food.<br>  <br>    Dermatological problems happen inside as well as out, and it seems he is having just that, which is why he would have digestion problems.<br>  <br>    For the moment, you might want to try a very easy to digest food such as I/D from your vet, and see how he does.<br>  <br>    I had an older dog that all of a sudden had digestion problems, a while back, and the only thing he could eat safely - after 11 years on nothing but Science Diet corn and chicken - was fish and oatmeal.  I had a diet made up by a veterinary nutritionist, and he did well for two more years.  But it was the only thing he could eat.<br>  <br>    He can have Gas-X for the gas, and you should discuss with your vet perhaps putting him on some flagyl for the bacterial overgrowth.  It will probably take some tweaking to get his GI tract happy again.<br>  <br>    In the meantime, don't give him anything with fat or oil, and keep in mind that the more ingredients things have, the more probability of it not being a happy thing for his insides.  And no canned food unless it's from the vet.<br>  <br>    Let me know if you need the recipe for the fish & oatmeal porridge - it was the one thing that stopped the gas in my old guy, and it's not that hard to deal with.  You would need a prescription from your vet to get the accompanying vitamins to round it out.|`|j45Q2ipRaa	It sounds like to could be allergies. <br>   <br>  My female lab seems to be sensitive to a lot of food and has the same chewing.

(wink)<br>  <br>  The problem may or may not be a food allergy and it's good that you have made a vet appointment to find out.<br>  Remember that it is a mistake to think in terms of food brand. Instead you need to think in terms of food ingredients. If your dog is allergic to chicken for instance it makes no difference if that chicken is in Purina or Orijen.<br>  <br>  edit<br>  To the TD ferry, knew you were coming.<br>  Now please explain to me the difference between the chicken in Purina ONE and the chicken in Orijen.<br>  I await your answer<br>  <br>  edit<br>  "TJ you want to know the difference! Between the chicken is in orijen is human great and Purina one is chicken no one wants to eat!

As I am not familiar with American dog food formulas, I cannot say what percentage of carbs the food contains. I can tell you that too little fat in the diet causes halitosis because the food is not being properly digested. If you can, give the dog about a tablespoon of fat every day. I'm talking about real animal fat, NOT margarine, which is so useless that neither rats nor cockroaches will eat it!  The sore on the leg may be nothing more than a local irritation, but it could be worse. <br>  A very good all-round prophylactic is 1.5 ml hydrogen peroxide added to 5 litres of water. Put this out for the dog to drink, but also give it another bowl of fresh, untreated water. You will probably find that it actually prefers the treated water. This will help to kill all manner of parasites, fungi, bacteria, viruses and the like. The dog's teeth will also become whiter. You can bathe the sore spot with this dilute solution of peroxide, which will kill just about anything that is causing it. The dog will not be adversely affected, as peroxide is nothing more than water with an extra oxygen atom attached and oxygen is one of the most effective antibody killers known to man.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	It certainly could be caused by the food.  A lot of dogs don't do well on foods with corn or wheat, and Purina has both in large amounts.  Gas is almost always caused by food.  Some parasites such as giardia and coccidia can cause increased gas, but you should also notice diarrhea with parasites.  However, that "sore" that you describe sounds an awful lot like ringworm to me.  It could just be a hot spot, but then it should be very red and moist, not dry and flaky/scaly.  Expect the vet to do a fungal culture for ringworm and possibly even start him on ringworm treatment while waiting for the culture results.|`|a29qiNkvaa	It could be from the food!  how old is he? sometimes dog dont show allergies until about 2 or 3 years old. my dogs turned 3 and bam the allergies showed up! <br>  <br>  Orijen is good food, but pricey! I would do some checking and see what other food you would be able to get.<br>  <br>  Taste of the wild is my first choice for a good quality food and the price. <br>  <br>  solid gold barking at the moon is also a very good food <br>  <br>  EVO is also a good food! this one is pricey but is worth every penny!! its about $70 a bag but you feed at-least half of that you are feeding now!

hGY08GjRaa	best age to spey/neuter is 4-6 monts. I prefer 5 months..<br>  ALWAYS before 7 months.<br>  <br>  If your kittens are male, they will be neutered, not speyed.. if you have a female kitten, she will be speyed. <br>  <br>  if  you only have males, just make sure to have them done before they are 7 months.. because around 5-7 months they start getting the "big boy" hormones and will possibly start spraying. This behavior USUALLY won't start till around 7 months or later.. you want to neuter before it begins!! It's a habit that will destroy  your house and force you to get rid of the cat. BUT it's 98% preventable by neutering BEFORE it begins. So neuter before 7 months. <br>  <br>  IF  you have female kittens or unspeyed females.. then you have a whole other ball-game. Please keep in mind a female CAN get pregnant as young as 4 months.. so people who have a bro-sis combo of kittens need to take special measures to avoid that. Kittens CAN be speyed/neutered as soon as they weigh 2 lbs (around 8-12 weeks) So that's one option.. the other is separating them until one is fixed.   A  male usually can't impregnante a female until he is around 5 months old at the youngest.. <br>  <br>  The "sex  urge" will come around 6 months or a bit later.  You won't ever have to worry about it or see it if  you fix him before 7 months.. Although I've still seen neutered males try to "service" a female who was in heat and driving eveyrone/thing up the walll..LOL... but generally neutered/speyed cats are without sex drive..|`|DtkLsetkaa	Well, first off, male kittens get neutered, not spayed.  Spayed is the term for when a female animal has her uterus and ovaries removed.  Its best to get them spayed before they reach 6 months (8 weeks is the earliest you can), they can show signs of sexual maturity before that, so don't let them around any females of ANY age until they are neutered.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Kittens as young as 4 months old have been known to breed and get pregnant.  Its best to neuter at 3-4 months old before they start coming into heat or spraying in the house.<br>  <br>  I would get your boys done now.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	Male kittens usually reach sexual maturity around age 6 months but some have been known to start as early as 4 months - at that point they will be willing to mate with a female in heat.  Male cats will search long distances for females in heat and will look for them all the time.  They can be safely neutered (spayed is what is done to females) at age 8 weeks and 2 lbs weight - this is the AVMA guideline.  Urine spray marking also starts around sexual maturity - a very nasty problem that you'll want to avoid as well.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Male kittens can be neutered as soon as they weigh 2 pounds (if they're otherwise healthy). Some vets like to wait till 6 months old but it's perfectly safe to have it done sooner.  They become sexually mature from 6 months old up. The sex drive in animals is stronger than any instinct they have (even the drive to eat). If a sexually mature male doesn't have a mate nearby, he will hunt one.  Tom cats have been known to travel for miles in search of a mate.  They can smell a female in heat up to a mile away, even if she is indoors.|`|g62ATenqaa	6 months you should get them neutered. not only will it stop them roaming and populating the area with more cats, it should stop them spraying and straying and generally make them a more lovable pet.|`|QdmDKKqZaa	It's very dependent on the cats. We have some seven month of kittens, four boys and two girl. One of the girls went into heat not too long ago, but the boys just really didn't seem to care very much. They left her alone because she didn't fight back when they attacked her and went to find someone else to play with. <br>  <br>  So, I believe is greatly depends.|`|iZ2J85Hpaa	Best to get them spayed at around 6 months old, but it is entirely up to you when you get them neutered, as it doesn't matter what age.<br>  <br>  Cats start to get sexually mature (well, my kitten did at 4 months old) at around 4 or 5 months old. I should know, as we have an elderly female cat who is spayed, and he kept chasing her and trying to "do it" with her. It was such a shame as he wouldn't give her a minutes peace..lol.<br>  <br>  Anyway... Hope I helped!
NnYB9eXiaa	Hi :)    Hamsters don't actually hibernate, but they can reach a state where their bodies sort of shut down - and it's not good for them.    Get a warm towel and hold him with it until he's heated up.  Make sure that his cage isn't in the path of any drafts - even if it's a warm one because it warm air doesn't always *feel* warm once the breeze reaches the cage.    If he still seems lethargic, get a heating pad, wrap it in a blanket and place it under the cage.  When you think he may need the extra warmth, turn it on for about 30 mins - it'll help.    As far as foods go, maybe extra sunflower seeds to fatten him up a bit, but heat is really what you need to focus on.  Because h's older, he's gonna need a lil extra tlc in that area :)    I don't want to make any other food suggestions because you didn't say if he's a Syrian (Teddy Bear, Golden, Panda, etc) or if it's one of the dwarf species.    If you need any other help, please feel free to message me, I'm always open to questions and very glad to help :)    Daisy|`|An2AopAqaa	Hamsters and other small animals should never be kept in a room which has rapid temperature changes. So if they are in the room with the main door to the house this is bad.     Keep him in your room with the door and windows shut and some kind of heater on (don't have him next to it). Make sure he has lots of bedding; newspaper is an excellent insulator so line the bottom of his cage/tank with sheets of it and also shred or rip it for his bedding. I used newspaper for my small furries for years and they've all been.    [:|`|nxKmMuFQaa	keep him in a warm place,   not next to a radiator but in the same room as one.   give him extra bedding and give him some of his favourite foods.  maybe some cheese as this will give him extra fat to keep him warm .|`|bMYw17ORaa	keep him really warm or he will hibernate, you might think he is dead but he is not.    my friend did it once because he thought he was dead but he wasnt and he buried him alive because he didnt know,  in a box and when he realized he went to get him back out and he was there, but a carcass and there was bite holes and scratches on the box :(|`|GaSK15Kpaa	Make sure where you are keeping him is the right temperature for hammys no more than 18degrees and no less than 5. It is a cold year.    Lucinda
AA11352641	Maybe she is cutting it by climbing under furniture. Does she do that often?|`|Rb1bwBC7aa	if i was you, i would take it to the vet ASAP       i love pugs, they are so cute =)|`|Ee2fwrqoaa	I sure wouldn't wait for a week or two.  Take the dog in ASAP, find the time.  We have no way of diagnosing your dog's problem.  Even if we were vet's would couldn't diagnose without seeing the dog in person.|`|74d8704d3b9fcff9814b477383d60eafaa	Ew, Pugs are gross and ugly, it don't matter what it has, let it go... i hate pugs.|`|82987c5133eb520901fdacb24b4dafb5aa	I wouldn't wait to take her...it sounds like whatever it is, is spreading...and if you have any other animals, they might get it.  good luck|`|v0RsFaAzaa	We are not vets and cannot diagnose your dog over the Internet. Only a vet is qualified to diagnose and treat your dog. You need to put 1 hour aside to take her in and get her looked at. Surely you can spare 1 hour!  ADD: This is to Trix! No one asked you if you like Pugs or not! Whether you like them or not does not matter.That is not the question she is asking! Your comments were uncalled for. If  you can't answer the question asked, then don't bother answering at all!|`|Do2pJx8Aaa	You need to take your dog to the vet. If you are too busy to wait, they will probably allow you to drop your dog off. There is no way I would just let my dog run around with unexplained open wounds.
XL62syrCaa	I am very impressed (and happy) to see your instructor teaching you guys with out stirrups.    But on to the burgundy rider:    Her legs stayed in the correct position the entire time and her two point was well supported (I take it you have spent a LOT of time in the rising trot with no stirrups) Your legs are strong and you didn't hang on your horses mouth. The only thing I would correct is your lower legs were a little stiff (I know heels down lower legs relaxed is hard) But you were moving with your horse and were comfortable without stirrups.    KUDOS to actually learning how to ride with our relying on your stirrups and hands. You have a great seat!|`|6DCQsdyuaa	the girl in the red jacket needs to sit up more, lean back in the saddle, get a deeper seat and put her shoulders back more. When she was at the walk her hands were to stiff. The girl on the white pony is not too great a rider|`|4hzIH4kXaa	She is moving to much with the horse, it will be more comfortable for her and the horse if she tries to keep a lot stiller.|`|9hI653b5aa	lengthen your stirrups you've got a grenadiers seat|`|yJqXmy8Caa	she needs to drop the horses nose by sweezing or sponging the inside rein, apart from that she ok.|`|47c4ff6e9c297fdfff7f161925a3e19eaa	I think that you looked pretty good. My only main concern would be your hands, and your back. When you cantered your hands where a bit low and too far up your horse's neck. And your back needs to be a little straighter; it wiggles a little when you canter, but your two-point looked wonderful and your release was also excellent- not too high or too low!     Keep on doing so well, and I'm glad that you're trainer has you do no stirrups, it's tough and painful, but you get better, quicker!|`|9UttDvcsaa	You have a great leg on your horse.  Over your higher jumps I would concentrate on sitting back on your approach as well as your landing.  Perching on your approach is what causes you to fall forward on your landing, try and sit back and maybe count your strides.  You are a great rider!   Good Job!|`|Pn9tPYKbaa	i dont know what color is burgandy lol. but the one in the pink jacket was pretty good. the one with the white horse needs to loosin up when she canters:) she looks to stiff.:)
D1beU6MPaa	Bless your heart. Honestly , if it were me, I would take him to another vet. <br>  It sounds like he has really been through it. And remember that just because a person has DVM by their name, does not make them a good vet. You really need to have him evaluated by someone that can give you straight answers. I have a lot of experience with dogs and I can tell you that this does need more attention that your vet has given you. I hope you can find a good, caring vet that will give him the care he needs. Good luck|`|Chxoncy7aa	Take the dog to another vet.  Do not let the dog suffer.  It sounds like he has suffered too much already.|`|MtERSUVzaa	Give your doggie as much fresh meat and animal fat as you can afford to do. Add 5 ml of 10% hydrogen peroxide (you can get this from a chemist) to 5 litres of water and give this to the dog as its drinking water. You can use the same dilution to wipe down the nose and eyes. It will bubble as it loosens the crusty stuff, but it is not dangerous, as it is releasing pure oxygen when it does this. Let me know how this works, as the dilution may be a little weak, but you should in any case see a difference in a day or two.|`|HgMFrllLaa	Pneumonia in dogs is very hard to get rid of. IMHO one month of antibiotics wasn't simply enough.<br>  I dislike overuse of antibiotics but you don't have another choice.<br>  Unfortunately.<br>  Best of luck!!!!<br>  Late Entry : just noticed it was you who "discontinued" the antibiotics. Hmmmm.  Perhaps you should think twice before deciding you are "smarter" than your vet.|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	Oh, I went through this with one of my adopted dogs.  His KC progressed into pnuemonia and it took a long time and quite a bit of money to treat.<br>  <br>  I HIGHLY recommend you go back to the vet or find another vet and do *exactly* what they say (do not stop the meds yourself.)  It took my young, otherwise healthy lab, two rounds of extremely strong antibiotics, steroid treatment, and an IV to get him well again.<br>  <br>  Pnuemonia is a pretty dangerous one to mess around with, so please don't try and go the natural or home remedy route with this.  But, along with the vet's treatment, bring your dog into the bathroom with you when you take a steamy shower...this will temperarily relieve some of the congestion and pain.  Best of luck to you both.
Amkmles0aa	get a vet now|`|pprrcLVhaa	well there really isn't a best way just let them both out and they will get along when they are ready i know this because i have had many cats they will get along on their own no worries    your alpha male will not be territorial with a female only towards males|`|MpQW0DNZaa	i have 5 cats and had some before them, when we get a new one they kinda hiss and fight so i would try feeding them in diffrent rooms and tap the one thats fighting with the other ,if they fight, on the nose. they get use to each other and try not putting them close together|`|SNllynBiaa	Put them in a room together and shut the door.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	bring a towel with your cats smell on it and take it to your parent house for about week|`|bxlYleZkaa	They will be wary of one another for a while and may fight to start with. Once territories are sorted it will be okay.|`|96827f15b3cc218a65143db6531a248daa	Put the male into a cat carrier and let them get to know each other. When he calms down let him out.|`|RA8PuTd5aa	Difficult, ours took about 2 years to get used to each other, they do fight ocassionally... but it's the older who is more dominant because he assumes it's his house and therefore is asserting himself. Amazingly the dog treats the young cat like an equivlent. Do it slowly.... and in your company, further advice ask a vet|`|r0SBAkhmaa	The small one will probably hide haha :) You should take the small one into your bedroom and keep it in there with the door closed for a day, make it feel safe and get to know it then just open the door and let them meet on thier own and see what happens. You can always hear cats that arnt getting along and stop them :)|`|eWObKmBSaa	Oh, I see trouble brewing up for the younger cat. IF the older one is territorial and has been alone in that house for a while, he will be mean.    I introduced a second cat(almost 1yr old) to my first cat (almost 1 yr old and they had a time getting adjusted with each other.  But they were both under 1yr old.  I took apx 48hrs.  Then they blended together.  But wait for someone else who had older than 1 yrs cats experience.  I watched over them continually, to see that they didn't hurt each other, for sure.  I almost waited too long, cause the first one there does get territorial to protect himself/herelf.  Watch out for your cat.|`|I0rOL46aaa	Introduce them very slowly, in a very controlled environment.  Have your parents hold onto their cat and you hold onto your cat, and slowly edge forward, pulling your cats along with you.  Let them sniff each other and don't let them go (maybe wear a thick sweater in case she feels the need to bring out her claws).  If they don't growl or hiss, or express any physical signs such as flattening their ears, pulling their tails down, or sticking the hair on their back up, then great!  If they do, try putting them in separate rooms and trying this approach (holding them and letting them interact in a controlled environment) several times a day until they can tolerate each other.|`|ulH28Fibaa	umm...ok first thing is first, the territorial cat is a male, while your cat is a female.  BE VERY CAREFUL, just have them meet on neutral ground...like a park, or even at a friends house.  Either way, they will have alittle hissing here and there, let them get to know each other.  The next thing you have to do is let your parents cat see your parents petting and playing around with your cat.  That way, their territorial cat will know ur cat is fine.      Trust me, i have 3 cats, (and intend to get more XD)    CAT LOVER SPEAKING AS WELL|`|rLFmDQezaa	According to my vet - keep one in one room and keep the other in the next room with the door shut and they will sniff each other through the bottom of the door. After a couple of days, open the door and see what happens.    I, however, didn't listen and just plopped my cats down and let them go. They stayed away from each other for a while, but then got used to each other.    The following link has steps and guidelines to follow when introducing a cat into another cat's household: http://www.todaysmodernwoman.com/Cats/25...|`|PBTgiffqaa	Put them in the same room with you and see how they act. If they act bad and growl then put them both in a crate where they have to be close to each other for a while and do that for a few days until they are nicer to eachother.|`|KlYMqKCsaa	put them in a small 2ft by 2 ft cage for a day   :)|`|fMe2wUMWaa	Just let them get used to each other.  Don't interfere unless you think one of them is getting hurt.|`|YuFAzsQgaa	this is what u do put one in a cage and the other outside of the cage and they will hiss and all that stuf but all cat that first met will and then love the male up in a room and take the female out let her put her scent and then put her back in the cage and then let him out and he will smell he all over and then he will know that she will be staying around and put her in the room he was in let her out then let her out that room let them smell each other most likely they will fight but that okay they will get over it i kno because i have 3 cat and got them a year apart and i did that and now they all sleep in the same bed hope it work hope i said it right
86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	What's already in there if anything? And what are the other two dimensions of the 4ft tank? So we can work out the actual volume to give you better ideas on stocking.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, have a read through this:<br>  <a href="http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Stocking_a_Peaceful_Community_Tank" rel="nofollow">http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Stocking_...</a>
AA11901352	I know most have said to transfer all the fish but really you don't want to do that in a new tank.  First check your water.  You can move a few fish into the new tank to be sure the cycle has started.  DO NOT move them all.  20 fish will spike your ammonia like wildfire here.  you need a source of ammonia so only add a few.  You also do not want to move them all at one time.  That would again spike the ammonia.  Only 10% of the volume of the tank in inches of fish a week apart.  this will allow the tank to adjust to the new waste load.<br>  <br>  Few at a time for the sake of your fish.  you can also help your new tank out by taking your old filter and putting it in your new tank.  This will help the bacteria colonies form a bit faster.|`|3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	Really no need to have waited.  The water doesn't "settle".  I'm guessing your under the misconception that it's "cycling", which it isn't if there's no ammonia source in the new tank.  See link for more info:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/biologicalcycle/a/nitrogencycle.htm" rel="nofollow">http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/biolog...</a><br>  <br>  What you should do, move all your fish over, and also move your old filter on the new tank and run it along with your new filter(assuming you also have a new filter).  Run both together permanently if you want, won't hurt.  But at least run them together for about a month so any beneficial bacteria in your old filter media will grow in the new filter media.  And, do not change out any of the filter media in the old filter for several months.|`|Sf5WK1Liaa	have you put water conditioner in your new tank as that helps the fish adjust to the new tank you should put about 5 fish at a time to stop a stampede happening in case one or two fish getting upset with the move swim all over the place another trick get a clear plastic bag fill it half way with the old tank water depending on the size of the fish put one or two in the bag tie it up with a bag tie or bread tie and let it float around the new tank for about 15 mins for checking out the new tank and they will settle down in 15 mins you can then release them to there new home use a small scoop for two reasons you should not touch your fish and you dont get much of the old tank water in  10 bags floating around you will have all your fish in after getting them out of the bags in about 20 mins dont for get a plastic bag wont have much oxegen in it so onthe fish size make sure that the bag can carry as much water for 15 mins for two fish you could add new water from your old tank but you could upset your fish small bag go with one fish so if you put in 10 bags you will be able to release them all together hope this will help you which way you do it is up to you but the plastic bag to me is the best ok they should love the new tank i dont know if it is bigger than the old tank seya.|`|BIeBuK3naa	The cycle in your new tank wont start unless you put a fish in there. what kind of fishes are there? I prefer that you put first the hardy fish. Because in the cycling process your water will go cloudy for the good bacteria to grow. and slowly add more fish if there is no stress or anything not good in your new tank. So transfer few at a time.|`|uyj3bWv1aa	you can transfer your fish now itself. before u transfer them see that u keep the filter on for about half an hour such that the chlorine in the water goes of. transfer all ur fish at once such that there will be no territorial conflicts among them in the new tank.
6KyyhE0Xaa	If it had been chased by a dog the initial wounds would be at the back end of the cat, or across the back where it would have been seized by the dog.  <br>  <br>  If a cat stood up to a dog the injuries would be across the front of the chest or abdomen, or neck.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.vet.uga.edu/vpp/IA/SRP/vfp/scavrpred.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.vet.uga.edu/vpp/IA/SRP/vfp/sc...</a>|`|9Ao28gYaaa	Weird question!<br>  <br>  Id wager a few wounds on the back legs perhaps and then almost certainly around the neck area. Perhaps under the chin biting upwards or from the side downwards as cats when cornered tend to roll onto their backs and then the dog may just chomp down.<br>  <br>  However it may have bitten it all over dogs tend to clamp on and shake the thing as hard as possible without worrying where to bite.|`|9T09iprPaa	normally around the head/neck area, foxes also chase cats at night and trust me when i say theres hundreds of them prowling the streets at night|`|ampkZtrXaa	Knowing cats, I would say probably all round the dogs face!|`|boyFmgfeaa	I had a cat once and it had been attacked by a coyote/dog.

In general, dogs go for the neck in attack, but I'm not certain about other creatures.|`|9qTY9kP2aa	Most likely the neck area and head since they "go for the kill" sort of speak. Good Luck!|`|a31IwYdUaa	My kitten was killed by a dog or a fox and she had been bitten around the throat and shaken.|`|uoLrp5mnaa	Most probably the neck and upper chest areas. Also maybe the head/face.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	Generally around the neck, but I saw a kitten who got literally picked up by a dog who had wounds on his stomach.  He had to be put to sleep because his intestines were ripped... poor thing.|`|e54245b949fc37ae37c1c0d76403714daa	Probably the head and neck area.  But also the hind quarters and feet or legs.  Cats use their claws to fight back, and could get wounds there.  And, when all else fails they run or try to get away, therefore the hind quarters could get bitten or wounded.  <br>  Of course if it was a skunk...their whole body would stink, and it would be their eyes that could be damaged.<br>  Good luck
McnuekTBaa	The cloacas are slightly swollen, which means they are males.<br>  Firebellies do not develop a tail fin, contrary to what a previous poster said.|`|So7lXdBKaa	males have a higher tail fin when adults  also have a blue sheen on sides|`|MstjbpVJaa	From you pictures I would say you had one of each.<br>  <br>  The testes of a male tend to be more pronounced when coming into breeding condition also the male is much brighter in colour.|`|gnuYbZc5aa	Look like trans-gender newts to me
miRzeIGeaa	Dogs do clean themselves from time to time and this is normal.  However, your new dog might have intestinal parasites, has he been wormed.  <br>  <br>  If not, you need to attend to this matter.<br>  <br>  If he has been wormed, he might have impacted anal glands, either way I would take him to a vet to be checked out and wormed.|`|0WASp0bHaa	Dog do this. <br>  Give him a bath. make sure he doesn't have a rash or sore|`|cY8DgJv5aa	He's cleaning himself.  Also, if they itch or are in pain, they'll lick themselves.  Fleas maybe?  Since he's a new pet, go ahead and get him to the vet to get him thoroughly checked out.  Mention the licking to the vet.  Other than that though, some dogs just lick more than others.|`|T1Si1yvlaa	he's trying to clean himself. get baby wipes and everytime your dog goes out to do his business wipe is paws and private area.<br>  <br>  I did this with my boxer, and I NEVER had this problem. it takes 3 minutes but its worth it!|`|rgPmkqwXaa	question: 'Why do dogs lick their privates?'<br>  <br>  answer: 'Because they can...'|`|4b67623de920c421c21d4a2a84b84023aa	We always say that animal lick them is they are cleaning them. The reason it lick cause it is actually cleaning itself.|`|aZi6BvBraa	Most men will tell you 'because he can' ;-)<br>  Most dogs do this, but if he is doing it all the time he might have an infection, get him checked out by a vet. My Mom's dog used to do this, turned out his foreskin was to tight, and it would get a little infected. So the vet made a wee incision and the dog has stopped doing it. Well still does it every now and then, but that's normal
d5dd5c88117886acd94d3e471bf73caeaa	From what I've seen on my window still, birds have jerky movements that are an answer to their instinctive self-protection. Imagine a slow moving, reflexively numb bird. Now that's a cat's prayer. The chicks from the birth itself have plenty of uncoordinated movements and rapid head turns perhaps to help keep up with their small size and help them be alert.|`|2098a834a762973eecc5b5c0cdb5cd91aa	coz they are always horny and searching for the next bird to bang

MmRDzhaHaa	When you put it in the wash, try adding a bit of cat flea shampoo(it smells nice so don't worry)this will kill any fleas and their eggs in your blanket!|`|cj31x3UMaa	If it JUST came out of the washer & dryer any fleas should be dead!<br>  ----------------------<br>  I have the most confidence in ADVANTAGE... my 1st time use was several days after bug bombing my house, flea bathing my cats & scrubbing everything - fleas were back hopping around less than a week later & swimming in the flea powder I had sprinkled around the floorboards. I went to my vet in tears after all my hard work... Advantage was new on the market & she sent me home w/ a box.<br>  <br>  I treated only the adult cats & saw dying fleas falling off their whiskers w/in 15-30 minutes. I never bug bombed again... the house was flea free w/in days.<br>  <br>  You see fleas don't live on the cats & dogs, they live in the carpets & furniture - lay their eggs there. They only hop on the dog or cat for a meal. Once they bite a treated animal they are goners. The eggs hatch in approx. 2 week cycles, they develop into new fleas hop on a treated animal & they are dead. Regular treatment takes care of any that get tracked into the house on your shoes.|`|AA11506593	It's unlikely that it's ONE flea. Good chance your home is infested. Everything into the washing machine and use HOT water. Then fumigate your cat and your entire home.

Fleas multiply like CRAZY.  The best way to get rid of them is at their food source...your pet.  Use Advantage from your vet as directed.  They will be gone in NO TIME! <br>  I have also put flea collars IN my vacuum bag.  That way when you suck the little bug-gars and their eggs up, they will meet their doom before they hatch and crawl out.|`|46d62da2d3dd3a53d1918e33824bbb8daa	try a smoke bomb for fleas n wash your blankets n sheets (you get the smoke bombs at the store where the bug spray is) you nor the pets can be in the house while u smoke out the home but it works ive used it. while your doing it bathe ur cat. i hate fleas they bite me too.

w9aR8ymGaa	A ferret is a living being.  If you are expecting your son to be the sole caretaker of his pet, please do not get him one.  Working in an animal shelter, we get so many pets dropped off with parents saying, "Timmy isn't taking care of it" or "Sally won't walk it enough" or "Johnny won't clean up it's poop"  You are the parent and any living thing in your house is your responsibility.  Have you ever seen a ferret that is so thin it looks like doll clothes?  I have and it's sad.  Unless you are willing to take care of the pet or supervise your child to be 100% sure he is feeding, bathing, exercising and cleaning up after the pet, please buy him a stuffed toy instead.<br>  <br>  That said, please check out www.petfinder.com (enter your zip code) and go talk to the people at the shelter about what characteristics you are seeking in a pet and they can point you in the right direction.  <br>  <br>  Also ferrets are considered "exotic" and need to go to a special (expensive) vet.  If you adopt a ferret instead of buy one, it will be cheaper AND already come neutered and descented.<br>  <br>  Please remember to neuter your pets to keep them healthier and non aggressive.<br>  <br>  I don't know where in the US the answerer a couple below me is from (crawdad), but in the tri-state area where I live, none of these 3 states (PA, NJ or DE) have that law and sell intact ferrets from mills and BYBs in the area.  Ferrets are illegal in CA.  Also turtles are illegal to be kept as pets in certain states.|`|jyGTlpzTaa	NonononononoOOOOO!!!<br>  <br>  Ferrets are not recommended as pets for children because:<br>  <br>  1. They bite. Baby ferrets bite freely, it can take up to a year to train a ferret out of biting, and even then they sometimes nip in play. They will also not tolerate any unintentional rough handling, which children do do sometimes.<br>  <br>  2. They are expensive...think of combining the costs of companion animals and cage pets. Ferrets require cages (or their own room) and toys, ferret proofing (which can end up being expensive), worming, neutering and vaccinations.<br>  <br>  3. They are VERY HIGH MAINTENANCE. THink like dog or cat, not hamster or guinea pig. A ferret needs a minimum of four and a half hours attention every day, day in day out...four hours of supervised free roaming time and half an hour cleaning up after them.<br>  <br>  4.

Ferrets are not a good starter pet, however to the other person, a hamster is 10 times more likely to bite you than a ferret. That and Ferrets are not a cheep pet to start off with. The animal alone in the United States will run you $100 at least. Then you need a large cage which is another 75-100 dollars. Now 99% ferrets sold in pet stores come from one of 3-5 places that are closely monitored by the federal government animal agencies. These ferrets by law are a certain age and have been fixed before being sold. If you need to get an indoor pet and not a cat or dog try a turtle. So long as your son knows to wash his hands after handling it they make good pets. I'm not sure where you live but a semi aquatic turtle need both land and water and can be fed everything from fish pellets to live feeder fish to vegetables. So long as you change the water and you have room a turtle is all most imposable to kill....

MtERSUVzaa	Actually, what you have done is wash the dog's smell off and it is trying to get it back! Have you not noticed that your dog will always try to rub against you when you have changed your clothing? It's the same thing: the dog wants the 'house smell' on the clean clothes. If you use air freshener or insect sprays in the house, you are altering the smell of the house, so he will do crazy things to try to get the 'normal' smell back. I do not know what the dog eats, but if it is 'perfumed' with artificial flavours like liver or steak, this might set him off again. Dogs do not care about flavours: they will eat the dung of other animals with no problems. The reason they do this is not within the scope of this question.|`|WE9wKQspaa	Oh its totally normal.

B6zl0AJDaa	Yes, it's best to separate them.  I have 2 older geldings that have been together since '02 now and my Azteca's pretty good about being separated from his QH buddy, but the QH has gotten very attached to the Azteca and would throw a hissy fit if he couldn't go with my Azteca.<br>  <br>  Separation works wonders.|`|meoRbjgCaa	This really shouldn't be about you feeling guilty, it isn't right or wrong to separate them, it just depends on what your intentions for having your horse is.  If you want to have a horse as a pretty pet that lives free and runs around with their buddy then keep them together.  If you want a horse that you can ride and that respects you, you need to create a more working mind for your horse, so then separate them.  horses are athletes and as with any athlete, they have to be in a mental zone to work in order to be acceptable about the riders decisions.  yours are in a herding mental zone, and that's okay except whenever you go to ride them.  It sounds as though it is even getting dangerous.  <br>  Think of when a horse is in training.  Does the trainer go and turn the horse out with his buddies after each lesson?  Not likely, most horses that are in training are in stalls or corrals and are focused on what they are learning.  I have never ever heard of a trainer releasing their protege into the herd while in training.|`|5M57TTfpaa	my horse is just like this! when i got her, she didnt get along with the mares in the mare pasture, they picked on her. so they put her in the pasture with a 8 month old filly halfinger and another older pony, and she gets along fine. then someone brought a huge shire, and she is in with my tb and the ponies. my horse is SO attached to this horse, and its only there for a short period of time. when you turn them out, and it has to be the shire first(because if she isnt, she nearly breaks the stall down), then mine wont shut up lol til she is out with her. and when we turn them in, we cant lead them, we have to open the door and let them get in their stalls. i cant really separate them, but i would<br>  <br>  if i were you, i would separate them into diff pastures or something. its nice to have a friend and company, so your not lonely, but its not right to be all over eachother... what if the other dies.. or something like that. if they distub your riding(like when you want to ride yours but she doesnt want to ride away from the other horse), then it might be best.|`|AA11570905	I have a horse that used to be herd bound.  It has helped that I keep them in separate stalls at night even though they get turned out together  during the day.  I started trailering him out to trail rides alone and he has improved dramatically, I also ride him out alone. I started by going just out of sight of the house and then when he was calm turning around and coming home. I don't usually have the problem of leaving one horse alone because I have 3 horses and a donkey.  Should I ever have to leave one alone though I lock him in the barn with a flake of hay and a bucket of water. It seems to work very well for me.|`|mKWwz1uUaa	Yes you should separate them, even if it's just at night, or even putting them out at different times alone.

Good luck|`|ge7QGN9Zaa	I am currently separating my 2 herd-bound Arabian mares. I purchased them together. They had been basically alone in a pasture for the past couple years with very little human interaction.<br>  <br>  I decided separating them was the right thing to do when the grey tried to rush the gate and then tried to push me down to get through the gate to get to the chestnut. Poor thing, she didn't realize my butt is as big as hers.<br>  <br>  I was told they were herd-bound when I got them and boy were they right. After months of working with them, I have now separated them into 2 paddocks with one paddock between them for 2 weeks. While the chestnut is doing well (she has a calmer personality), the grey is still weaving and yelling out when she sees the chestnut.<br>  <br>  If I have her at the cross ties or in hand when the chestnut is close, she pulls and starts to get out of hand. I can forget working her in the round pen after that. She has not concentration at that point. The trainer for the chestnut is going to start working her in 2 weeks (once the chestnut is done). All indications show the grey, while broken, has never had a good trainer and may have been abused. We hope to help her to be more comfortable in her own skin.<br>  <br>  I've heard several theories. She may never like being alone. She may need another 3rd party and may be ok with loosing the chestnut if she has company. She may only ever be attached to the chestnut and another horse may not help. Hope to introduce her to another this weekend and it may help.|`|zMXDolD9aa	I'd say attempt to seperate, as it could become even more of a problem.<br>  Try taking one out, maybe for a ride, an hour or so at a time. Anxiety could also come because horses are herd animals, so one shouldn't be left just on their own anyway - they should be with other horses other than each other. It'd be in the best interest for you and your horse. This doesn't mean they shouldn't EVER see each other, their stalls could be nearby (if they have them). They need to get used to it in the case that they're split up in the future, which is inevitable in circumstances regarding shoeing, vet checks etc.

GlZMFlo5aa	I would talk to a vet and get your cat checked out (if you haven't already). Although, this sounds more behavioral what your cat is doing, sometimes cats will do this if they need their anals expressed or for some other reason(s). Even if it is behavioral, I would talk to a vet because they can help you by giving you advice on breaking this bad habit. Good luck!|`|Rw7gi86Naa	There are so many possible reasons for a cat to stop using the litter box that it's hard to cover them all. The first reason you need to rule out is a bladder/urinary tract infection, or constipation. You will need to take kitty to the vet to get checked out. Has the litter box been cleaned properly? Have you moved it to a different location? Have you recently changed anything such as brand of litter, litter box or food? Have you used any new disinfectants in the box? Has someone new come into your house that s/he didn't seem to like? Any new pets? Even new carpets or furniture can cause this. <br>  <br>  Here are some suggestions to your litter box problems:<br>  - Provide a box for each cat <br>  - Provide constant access to a box <br>  - Go back to previously used brand of litter and/or <br>  - Discontinue new disinfectant <br>  - Move box to where it was previously used <br>  - Eliminate new or frightening noise near litter box <br>  - Move food and water away from litter box <br>  - If cat is only going in one spot, put the litter box at the exact location and gradually move it back to where you want it at the rate of one foot per day <br>  - If there are several places, try putting dishes of cat food in those areas to discourage further elimination there <br>  - Experiment with different textures of litter, (cats prefer sandy litter) <br>  - Use a covered litter box for cats that stand in box but eliminate outside of it <br>  - Keep in mind that some cats are rather picky, and prefer to have two separate boxes, (one to pee in and one to poop in).<br>  <br>  Problems arise when your cat doesn't like or develops an aversion to the litter box that you have provided. There is absolutely no reason to expect every cat to like the same material, or even for one cat to prefer the same material over an entire life span. If your cat is having litter box problems then you will need to figure out how to make the litter box appealing to the cat. Here are a few options: <br>  1) Pain or illness can cause a cat to stop using the litter box. Cats are very adept at hiding illness, so if your cat is having litter box problems then the first thing you need to do is take the cat to a vet for a medical exam. <br>  2) If you aren't scooping the waste out of the litter every day then you need to start and start now. <br>  3) Perfumes or other odors can drive your cat away from the litter box. Scented litters are unacceptable to many cats, and the leftover scent from a cleaning product could also be a problem. Get rid of the perfumes, and scrub those cleaners away before giving the box back to the cat. Remember that cats have an acute sense of smell. <br>  4) Your cat may feel vulnerable when in the litter box. Is it in a noisy location, (such as next to the washing machine). Is it secure from little marauders like dogs and children, or even other cats? If the box is not semi-private, move it to a better location.<br>  5) Remember those preferences that we talked about earlier. You may need to offer several different types of litter before finding the right one. Strange but true, some cats will not use the same box for urine and feces, in which case you'll have to provide two boxes. The type of box could also be a problem. If the box has a cover, try removing it. <br>  6) Anxiety can lead to litter box lapses. Did some event scare your cat? This could be anything from a new couch to a new cat or even a new person in the house. If you suspect anxiety, confine the cat to a safe and secure place, (maybe a bed room) until the anxiety has passed. Cats seem to hang on to their emotions, so the anxiety could last much longer than the actual event. No need to rush, leave that safe haven available to the cat for as long as possible. <br>  7) If you have multiple cats, chances are you'll need multiple boxes, maybe even with different materials in them. <br>  There is one more important distinction that you'll need to make. Is the cat refusing to use the litter box, or is the cat spraying? Spraying is a territorial behavior and has nothing to do with disliking the box. For more information on litter box problems or spraying, consult with a trained behaviorist.<br>  <br>  Correcting the Problem <br>  The key to solving elimination problems is to make the litter box more attractive, and the area where the cat is soiling instead, unattractive. Sometimes, just cleaning the litter box more frequently or changing its location will correct the problem. Other times, you may need to experiment with different combinations of location and kitty litter to find a solution. You may even want to offer your cat the choice of several different boxes, each with different kinds of litter, to see which he or she prefers. At the same time, you must break the cat's habit of soiling in the new location. Be sure to clean the soiled area thoroughly with a pet odor remover to get rid of any urine scent -- or your cat may be attracted back to the same spot. It's important to keep the cat away from the area. Try covering the spot with carpet runner, prickly side up, or|`|RyYWzEZcaa	when you clean the poop from the carpet put it in the litter box....maybe she just needs to remember that is where it goes.....worked for my cat!|`|DAsQ4UZ8aa	I have studied cat psychology for over twenty years, and always trained my cat to do tricks. Food is the key to training 'tricks'.  In your case, the solution may sound cruel, but is effective and is tried and true.  In a small room, like a small bathroom or laundry room  (not a closet). put your cat in there with the cat box on one side of the room and the food and water on the other side of the room. DO NOT leave anything on the floor that can be substituted for cat litter, like a rug, shirt, blanket.  Also the room must be uncarpeted.  Unless your cat is really suffering from a brain disorder, it will get the message pretty quick.  Most normal animals will not defecate or urinate anywhere near their food source.  I know it sounds mean, and I guarantee your cat is going to 'howl', but what would you prefer,  a stinky house, or a couple of weeks of isolation for puddy cat?  I have recommended this to friends with the same problem, with great success.  Also if a cats box is dirty or overfilled, it is going to relieve itself on the first pile of clothes it can find.  And yes I am a cat lover.|`|Maw2rtKZaa	Cats are sometimes hard to figure out.  They can be spiteful little buggers.

She pees in the one box and then immediately poops in the other. These boxes are in the same room together. Your cat may be doing the same thing.

Take your cat to the veterinarian for a good examination.  Be sure to tell your veterinarian about the house-soiling problem.  If your cat gets a clean bill of health, here are a few things you can consider:<br>  <br>  Litter cleanliness: Be sure you keep the litter box very clean.  Cats are clean animals and some may want their box meticulous.  This may mean scooping 1-2 times daily and/or changing the entire material every 3-4 days.<br>  <br>  Litter box location:  Check around where the litter box is to be sure that there is not something about the location that the cat may find a problem.  This could be a noisy appliance, people walking by, the dog approaching, nearby children playing, or other cats in the household.<br>  <br>  Disharmony between housemates:  In a home with multiple cats, there may be subtle underlying tensions that may make one or more cats anxious.  This could lead to non-litter box usage.<br>  <br>  Continued use of one particular material:  If your cat has been eliminating outside of the litter box for some time, it may have developed a preference for another material besides litter.  If you think this is the case, consult your veterinarian for help or a referral to a veterinary behaviorist or an applied animal behaviorist.
58410e61549a3fe40d177cf7e71fc875aa	Although a broken bone can seriously limit or ruin a horse's career, pedal bone fractures are an exception and have an excellent prognosis. Although it is unusual in a horse so young, the fact that he is still growing will be in his favour. My youngster had a suspected pedal bone fracture as a yearling, and he's recovered well. <br>  <br>  Frequently, pedal bone fractures are an exception to the gloomy prognosis for fractures in the horse. And when the injury is diagnosed promptly, and treated correctly, the prognosis for full recovery can be excellent. Pedal bone fractures often occur as a result of a sudden traumatic injury to a horse's foot. Such injuries can happen following horses kicking out against solid objects, such as walls or cross-country fences, or during normal ridden exercise if the foot lands awkwardly on an uneven surface. Occasionally, horses may fracture their pedal bones as a result of a severe penetration by a nail or sharp stone.<br>  <br>  Following a pedal bone fracture, the horse is often extremely lame and may not be able to bear weight on the affected leg. The hoof may feel hot and inflamed and any pressure or percussion (ie tapping) of the foot can be severely resented by the injured horse. <br>  <br>  Treating pedal bone fractures depends on the age of the horse, the type of fracture and the preference of your vet. But box rest is the most important part of the treatment.<br>  <br>  The duration of rest is variable, though 2-3 months of total box rest, followed by 2-3 months of controlled exercise from the box, is required to allow the bone to heal.<br>  <br>  It is also important that the foot is immobilised to prevent movement of the bone. Every time a horse bears weight on its foot, the hoof wall expands slightly, which allows movement of the pedal bone and leads to a delay in any healing. The simplest way to immobilise a hoof is to shoe the horse with a bar shoe with quarter clips, which will prevent this expansion.<br>  <br>  Occasionally, a rim shoe may be used for the same reason. A piece of sheet metal is welded around the foot and and the foot sits within the rim. Expansion of the foot can be prevented further by applying acrylicmaterials between the foot and the rim shoe.<br>  <br>  Probably the best way to prevent foot expansion is by applying a cast to the limb. Various types of cast can be used, such as enclosing the hoof alone, enclosing the hoof and pastern or enclosing the whole limb below the hock or the knee.However, casts can cause complications, so it is still common to use a bar shoe alone. However, being that your boy is so young, it may be worth discussing the use of a cast or a hoof boot to imobilise his hoof.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, surgery is necessary. When the pedal bone is cracked straight down the middle, placing a screw across the joint to compress the two pieces of bone back together can be an excellent technique to speed its healing. This allows a quicker return to soundness and work. However, despite this, placing the screw into the bone in the hoof can have serious complications, such as infection.<br>  <br>  Surgery is also often required when there has been a penetrating wound to the foot, fracturing part of the bone which subsequently becomes infected. In such cases, the fractured piece of bone often loses its blood supply and dies off. The horse's body then recognises the piece of bone as foreign material, which causes a persistent infection of the foot. The only cure for this is to remove the dead piece of bone surgically through either the sole or wall of the hoof.<br>  <br>  The prognosis for pedal bone fractures is generally good, but this depends on whether the fracture enters the coffin joint (the joint between the pedal bone and the short pastern bone). Acertain number of horses with such fractures end up with severe osteoarthritis of the joint, for which there is little successful treatment available.<br>  <br>  One of the most difficult decisions for vets dealing with pedal bone fractures is when the horse can restart exercise. This decision is made more difficult as X-rays can be of little assistance - often, the fracture line is still obviously visible on X-rays many years after the horse has become sound and is back in full work.<br>  <br>  In many instances, the decision of when to return a horse to work, or regular turnout, is made purely on the clinical progress of the horse and its degree of soundness, with follow-up X-rays providing little, and often conflicting, information.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your youngster.

G0KKfXMUaa	Well, first, make sure you have a good and strong seat.<br>  <br>  Sitting deep, and straight up in the saddle is very important at the canter. It helps you give him the correct signals.<br>  <br>  As you begin cantering, and he gets to fast, do many half halts. And to also help, slightly sit back. Try not to put to much pressure with your legs, because then that defeats the purpose of pulling. Also say a deep, low, and long, "woaahhh".<br>  <br>  If he's still to fast, canter him in circles instead of around the whole ring. Instead of using the whole ring, you can use half of it, or just do large circles in the corner of the ring.<br>  <br>  Circles will prevent him from going too fast, help regulate pace, and also help get it through his head that he needs to slow down.<br>  <br>  You could also try longing before riding to help rid him of some excess energy.<br>  <br>  Have fun =)<br>  <br>  Edit-<br>  <br>  And, yes, transitions are also helpful. A lot of canter to trot, back to canter, then down to a trot, and so on will help. Though, make sure he doesn't get a habit of thinking he can just stop once you want him to canter around a full lap or two.<br>  <br>  I'm saying that because I once bought a horse that was labeled, "too fast", and the girl tried to do a lot of transitions. And so when I did what I first stated above, he calmed down. But then I had to deal with his thinking of "I can stop because she just wants me to trot". That got a little irritating. But it all worked out.<br>  <br>  Oh, and you could also try to see how he does with a standing martingale.|`|AA10986942	To get your horse to lope (correctly) you will need to set her up correctly for the lope. Pick up on her reins ... a few bumps straight up until she flexes at the poll and gives to the bit, at the same time you will be applying pressure or bumping her with both legs to round out her back.. when you feel her lift her back and she is in the bridle (on the bit) push her hip to the inside with your outside leg.. is everything in position? If it is then kiss and urge her into a lope. keep her hip to the inside (never in a class, only when learning) this will make her get her hock up under her where it needs to be to get a true lope. Make sure you are holding her in the bridle still so she is loping but you are not letting her move forward very fast. The idea is you are pushing the back end forward but holding the front end back... at this point you are still holding up on your reins to keep her on the bit, right? when you are feeling like she has a nice rhythm SLOWLY lower your hand. (NEVER just drop your horse, they are using you for balance and you should pick them up slowly and let them go slowly or they will just fall apart) She will probably let out her head, move onto her forehand and go faster... so now just pick her up again, bump with both legs to pick up her back, keep her hip to the inside... you want to rock her back on her hind quarters, that is where the lope needs to come from...when she feels good again keep her there for a while.. then slowly let her go again... and just keep going. She will need to build up strength in her back to be able to hold this on her own so you will need to keep doing this exercise (holding her) Make sure you are squeezing with you legs and urging her forward the whole time you are holding her back with your reins... when she is finally trained you will be able to ask for a lope by picking up your reins slightly to collect her, bump her to pick up her back, push her hip in (these are only get ready for something cues she should not lope yet..) when everything is set up you will kiss and she should take a beautiful lope depart while being able to stay in frame. A squeeze from your legs will control her speed... the more you squeeze the slower she will go. (because she now knows that a squeeze means to round her back and collect) you will be able to almost lope in place like this when she builds up enough strength to hold that.<br>  Edit.... I never say whoa unless I mean WHOA!  This is confusing to say whoa and then say never mind....|`|kd9kWB8Kaa	i just keep telling mine slow while pulling back on reins and pressing forward with legs.|`|y7H1V39Jaa	I don't agree with allowing a horse to canter fast, then fighting him to show him down, just begin his canter the way that you want him to canter in the first place.  To canter correctly, a horse has to have the right muscle tone in the right places and can't be expected to canter correctly indefinitely unless he is prepared for it.  There is no secret to how to teach a horse to collect himself, ask him to do tasks that require him to be collected. to be at the ready to respond.  Transitions are good, but they don't need to be done at full speed, even at a walk and a trot can teach a horse to collect himself.  Rollbacks using a fence or side of a barn, even at a slow pace, will teach your horse to be ready to respond, do it enough and he will maintain his collection as part of his being.  There are different degrees of collection, but this is a good way to begin.|`|zIGTzoxjaa	make sure you are sitting deep in the saddle<br>  lean back slightly and tighten your butt muscles (as weird as that sounds) while relaxing your legs and gently bringing the outside rein back with you. (basically preform a half halt) once your horse slows down a little praise him for being good, but if he is still too fast, just preform another half halt. it's a give and take process. <br>  <br>  hopefully that helps :]|`|5JNhV6Ovaa	I would work on transitions, trot and canter. Using leg yields, half halts.<br>  <br>  Also another good thing to do is to work in circles and figure 8's.<br>  <br>  Lounging him with a surcingle and long lines.<br>  <br>  Possibly even ground poles<br>  Trot...........3' to 3'6". <br>  <br>  Canter.........6' to 7'<br>  (average sized horse)|`|InxxEQvYaa	velcropap- thats just like pressing the gas and the brake at the same time.|`|dBRxfRGqaa	If you have an arena, work on a lot of canter-trot transitions, don't stay in the canter for too long. As soon as you feel him starting to go too fast or get bracy, just bring him down to a trot or walk. don't worry about steering, just go. And, don't worry about collection until he can canter nicely on a loose rein. Transitions are really good for almost anything, and i hope this helps. I know this might not work for some horses, but it especially works for horses who get emotional or excited. Important things to know are don't hold him back, just let him go if you can. Collecting a horse that wants to move too fast can lead to disaster, because they feel claustrophobic or constricted. So for now, i wouldn't try to collect at the canter until it feels natural and calm. I really hope this helps!
aLGe7JZEaa	A fishmonger (fishwife for women practitioners - "wife" in this case used in its archaic meaning of "woman") is someone who sells fish and seafood. In some countries modern supermarkets are replacing fishmongers who operate in shops or markets.<br>  <br>  Many fishmongers as well as butchers are a dying breed. With the advent of many modern ways of distributing and packaging food, supermarkets many times opt for less expensive alternatives to these trained, highly skilled professionals. Fishmongers are trained at selecting and purchasing, handling, gutting, boning, filleting, displaying, merchandising and selling their product.<br>  <br>  Fishmongers can be broken down into two categories: wholesale and retail.|`|3904bf9cec60af77f3ce3e9dfcd8c007aa	A person that sells fish for a living.|`|MJW7Etk3aa	i sell live fish|`|AA11901352	A fish monger is quite simply someone who sells or trades fish for a living.  Usually these people own a fleet of boats and have a crew that trolls or nets Tonnage of fish.  The boats bring the fish to the mongers place of business (usually on the water but not always)  there they prepare fish for trade or resale (wholesale).  Anyone can purchase fish in any number of ways prepared by the monger.  Even the carcass's are sold for soup stocks, crab and fish baits.  A monger is not an end resale.  The monger simply deals with fresh caught fish.  They aren't mothers or wives they are business owners.  Coastal towns have many fish mongers.<br>  <br>  A fish monger is NOT a person dealing with Ornamental fish.  A monger sells fish for human consumption.|`|ur5wDhkMaa	The word monger originates from Saxon English, it means merchant or marketman.<br>  <br>  A true fish monger can only be found in a market, likewise iron monger or cheese monger.

Good job, and I know its frustrating, but if it was a small child begging at the door to go outside and play unsupervised, would you let it out?  You are so right in the thought that you live near a busy street and that is a huge danger.  Maybe try playing with her when she cries to draw her away from the door and get her tired so she sleeps at night?  Might be worth a shot.|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	keep her inside!!!! he desire to go outside is not as important as her safety. even people who live in rural areas should not have outside cats. they could be harmed or die from other animal attacks, or crazy people who enjoy hurting animals. if she wants to go out, and she is up to date on all vaccines, try buying a cat harness and leash and taking her out like that.|`|UNFxjNHkaa	keep her inside!  Indoor cats live much longer lives and she'll be much healthier and safer.|`|JGq9rKBOaa	Absolutely keep her inside! <br>  <br>  I TNR-ed (Trap, Neuter, Release) feral cats for years. The cats that would not have adjusted well to an indoor environment, I released. The cats that had any chance of a normal "pet" lifestyle, I adoped out to indoor homes only. <br>  <br>  Cats are happy indoors. Cats don't "need" to be outdoors - inside living can provide them just as much mental stimulation. Buy your cat toys, play with her - she's not really missing anything about being outside! <br>  <br>  One time when I was a child, my father left a basement window unlatched and two of our cats got outside. One, who had been brought inside as a very young feral kitten, went and sat under the birdfeeder for about an hour before we noticed, and then we went outside, picked him up, and brought him in. He sat on the windowsill and kept watching the birds. The other, though, who had been taken inside when he was about 5 months old, decided to give "the wild life" another try and eluded capture for almost a month. Cats DO revert to their "wild ways," and it's not necessarily for the best. Puff (the cat) survived outside because we always put food out for the ferals that we cared for, but after a few weeks of not coming inside - he stayed in the yard the whole time he was out - he decided to go back to the window that he got out of and meow to be let back in. He had lost a significant amount of weight from having to compete with the other cats for the food that we provided. And that long story is just the reason that we never adopted out ex-feral cats to homes that would allow them inside. The same reason that you don't have "just one drink" if you're an ex-alcoholic!<br>  <br>  It's far too dangerous to let cats outside in cities. Not only is it dangerous to the cats - traffic, diseases, fights with other cats - it's a nuisance to other people. Even in rural or suburban areas, the lifespans of outdoor cats are drastically shorter than indoor cats. Every time someone says, "My outdoor cat ran away," they mean it disappeared. Cats don't leave their territory for no reason - they get hit by cars, they get injured and are unable to return home. People say their outdoor cats are happy - well, the cat might be happy for now, but they're really taking a big risk with the cat's well-being.<br>  <br>  I currently have two ex-feral cats. I took one of them in as a young kitten and bottlefed her, the other was on the older side. Now they're about 11 and 12 years old, and they've lived indoors their entire lives, perfectly happily.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	Absolutely. Keeping your kitten inside is the best choice. You have to ignore the meowing and eventually she'll understand that she's not going back outside. It may be very difficult because cats sure know how to look cute and hopeless until they get what they want. Be strong!<br>  <br>  Cats that live indoors live longer, healthier lives. Statistically, the life span of an indoor cat averages 12 to 14 years, whereas it is only about four years for the outdoor cat. More than 1 million outdoor cats are killed each year by dogs, traffic, and exposure to disease. In the long run, keeping your cat indoors will also save you money in vet bills.<br>  <br>  There are many risks that come with letting your cats roam free outside:<br>  - They have a much higher chance of catching diseases and other illnesses such as: Feline Leukemia (FeLV), Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP), Feline Herpes Virus (Rhinotracheitis), Feline Distemper, Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV), rabies, tapeworm, ringworm, heart worm, hypothermia and urinary tract infection<br>  - Ingesting chemicals or poisons such as pesticides, home garden products and car/motor products<br>  - Getting fleas or ticks<br>  - Injury/death due to dangerous traffic <br>  - Eating poisonous spiders, insects or plants<br>  - Injury/death due to cruel humans, hunters or neighbors<br>  - Attacks from dogs, other cats or wild animals <br>  - Other accidental injuries<br>  - Getting lost or stolen|`|lmT3zXa9aa	There are too many dangers outside for a cat - traffic, dogs, animals such as raccoons (who will attack a cat) and even coyotes (yes, in urban areas.)<br>  Keep her occupied with plenty of toys and make sure her litter box is kept very clean.  Sometimes cats want to go outside because of boredom or because their litter box is dirty.<br>  If she is willing then you could try training her to walk on a leash, and you could take her out for a stroll.  I had a neighbor who trained all her cats to walk on leashes, and she took for them walks each evening.  I haven't tried this myself, but my vet says that she has clients who have done it, too.|`|cj31x3UMaa	This is a trick from my vet for all the cats that live in her clinic.<br>  <br>  Roll up a newspaper & beat on the door yelling at it when the cat goes to sit/cry by it.<br>  <br>  She will not understand what the door did, but will not want to have anything to do w/ it & will stop sitting there where she might accidental get out.<br>  <br>  You *are* doing the right thing keeping her inside! I adopted a stray in the 1970s that ripped screens off windows, so I let her out late at night when the traffic died down - we were on a busy street too. She did not come home one night & we found her body next morning under a bush - a dog had killed her right next to our fence.|`|r7ZaxU8Laa	She may not be crying because she wants to go out. If you're in bed, then it wouldn't make sense for her to cry to go out. She may have been taken away from her mother at too young an age and is simply crying for her. It may not be a conscious act on her part, but something thats instinctual. I think she will eventually stop. I would NOT let her out. Feral cats adjust to being inside. Give her time.|`|bdc0b0f0724a4bf1ba102444af8d0705aa	has your kitty been spayed?  that helps a great deal.|`|wB6zFmIZaa	i have 3 cats and they all live in my house they dont go outside and they are happy  to dangerious out side for cats
rQlzfHqraa	I would think the mother was killed in traffic and you are now the care giver. Put it in a shoe box with grasses or straw for nest material. Feed it mixture of chick starter and water with a large eye dropper making sure to insert the tube down past the breathing valve just inside the bottom beak. When a week old drop three or for stones (the size of a rice grain) down the throat while feeding the mix. Birds need these in the gizzard to grind the food before it can pass to the intestine. When it is half feathered you can start feeding a wild bird seed mix. Drop them one or two at a time in the throat. Also, one or two at a time, add three or four stones (the size of a corn kernel). Give some water every time you feed seeds, grains or stones. When I butchered squabs there were always some stones in the gizzard. They had to have been fed by the parents as I didn't feed those birds. Wild bird feed mix, chicken scratch feed and pigeon grit will be a good diet for a pigeon. Always have these and water available to the bird.|`|MstjbpVJaa	The chick will not survive unless you or someone with the knowledge can feed it .<br>  The parent has been disturbed by you and the plastic and will be reluctant to return to the nest.<br>  So it is up to you to find a rescue centre.|`|AA11362465	Hello,<br>  <br>  I know you meant well by putting the insecticide tablets on the nest and the chick, but that stuff will kill him.

LBAh1tPoaa	I have had this problem. I tied all the dogs, one new, two established, up close but out of reach of each other for several hours. I did this at a friend's house where none of the dogs had ever been and didn't have a claim to. They barked for a few minutes then eased off. After several hours I fed them, established dogs first in their usual order. Once they had finished eating I took all three for a very fast, very long, very exhausting walk, slowly moving them closer until they were touching. By the time they got back they were all buddies and have remained that way. The shared experience of sniffing out new smells together, of being the strange dogs in another dog's marked territory seemed to establish a rapport.<br>  <br>  PS, before all this happened, I swapped bedding from each of the dogs to the other - to get them familiar with the smell.<br>  <br>  I got this advice from a guy called Jim Quinn, in my opinion (and the FBIs) one of the world's best dog trainers. He has even trained dogs for Queen Elizabeth II as well as the FBI.|`|MGAmNxddaa	on neutral territory...do not bring the dog home to where all the dogs already live.....engage the help of a couple friends,to meet you in a park with your dogs.YOU,should be the one walking the newcomer....so your dogs may sense that he is okay.|`|FaPrr8bbaa	My son and his big furry senior dog live downstairs with a gate at the top of the stairs to keep my dogs from going down there.

Dogs travel, they need to walk. Try to make this meeting and walk on neuteral ground so niether one of them in in the others territory. The humans need to be the leaders and not let the dogs take over the position of telling who to go where and when etc. <br>  Also the best thing to do is not put a time limit on this other wise it just wont work, stay calm and assertive. <br>  When the dogs meet each other make sure the humans are the ones that bring them to the meeting, and dont put them face to face. Face to face meeting means fight! especially if one or more dogs has a dominant energy. Let them sniff each other, keeping them on leashes or muzzling them just to be safe. <br>  I suggest checking out Cesar Milans website, the dog whisperer he is amazing. :-)|`|q1EDNQhBaa	Have you ever watched the dog whisperer. Loads of tips on there. Take your dogs for a walk and have a friend bring your new dog and walk them all together. You holding all the leads.

6KyyhE0Xaa	Hi!  I'm a vet in the UK.<br>  <br>  You can opt to not have her shaved - most vets would put her under anaesthetic for it because sometimes the mats can be very close to the skin, and if the cat is at all fidgety (which most are in a strange place that smells of dog and where people keep jabbing needles into them!) there is a real risk of skin wounds when trying to the remove the matted hair.<br>  <br>  A lot of the time you can get a quick look into an animals mouth, but for the most part to get a really good examination the animal needs to be sedated.  In the practice I work in, every animal over 8 years old has a pre-anaesthetic blood sample taken, to give us a better idea of the general health of the animal, and its heart is checked by a vet, before we sedate it.  The older the animal is, the greater the risk, although every vet will try to minimise this.<br>  <br>  If her gum wasn't bothering her you could almost get away without much in the way of treatment, but as it appears to be hurting her you're probably best biting the bullet and taking her in.  Your vet may wish to try painkillers and antibiotics to see if the condition improves, before doing anything more drastic.<br>  <br>  Let me know how you get on!|`|3e4b555de8c5e23d560c245d776a7cc0aa	It sounds as if she may need sedation to deal with the gum :-( But that's just my opinion, I am not a vet!<br>   If I were you, I would find a local vet, pop her along and have a chat about it. I think you will find that most vets will take the time to discuss any worries you have. <br>   If you know you can deal with the tats, tell them that. Just let them know that you are worried about her nose and gum and I am sure they will advise you of the best course of action.<br>   Have an ask around to see if anyone knows a good vet in your area.<br>   Good luck with your baby, hope she's better soon :-)|`|DAsQ4UZ8aa	Take your cat to the vet for the gum infection immeadiately!  Has your cat been innoculated for feline leukemia?  If your cat has pseudonomas, it need to be treated right away. This could be contracted from a dirty water dish, or something your cat ate (if it goes outside).  As for the sedation, if your cat is healthy then it should not be a problem.  Just make sure the vet puts lubrication drops in its eyes before the shaving as this will prevent any cysts from developing from 'dry eye'. Hope this helps|`|mR5RkClpaa	well i have a persian cat angus, he is 15, i brush him about 4 times a day , and this action saves me a lot of bother, as tangled fur does not happen then.it is easy for me to do this as he jumps up on a chair where i brush it ,about 4 times a day in other words he also loves to get brushed , so i dont have any pile up . and cat does not get any fur ball.he also goes to vet twice a year for one his jag,and gets dematted twice a year as there are parts i cant get to his stomach, round about his backside. he gets sedated, your cat needs to see a vet for his nose and mouth. 5 years is too long,i also have a cat who is 19 and needs sedating every so often for his teeth , dematting etc. sedation is fine, and does not harm him at 19.back to angus when he gets his dematt he gets parts only shaved , stomach. at rear end. etc. and always gets sedated for his sake and vetinary nurse,they do not have to treat cat without sedation. if it is a risk to them, scratched from cat etc, and they are within their right, about this,i would say try to get a good rapport for the cats sake and take cat to vet now for checkup and also a dematt  at 15 cat needs a check up and fur dematt urgently  they need extra vetinary care at that age|`|ree7wp74aa	hi sorry cant help with the vets but i have a cat who has long hair, i brush her with a furminator every week, shes not had any knots for a year now, she used to let me shave her knots off, my other cat who came as a stray wont let me near him he has to go to the vets and be sedated, his back is fine he lets me furminate his back but only for a few minutes. buy a furminator they are quite expencive about 20 quid from petshops, if i lived closer i woul;d let u try mine|`|bMvqWPrWaa	Hi there, <br>  <br>  You say that you have been able to keep her fur under control for most of her life, but now her knots are getting quite bad.  Are you not able to deal with the knots yourself before taking her to the vet?  If so, and the vet suggests that she needs shaving, you can tell the vet that you have always taken care of her fur and your main concern today is her mouth.<br>  <br>  Any vet who can see an animal is in good health and taken care of by their owner should respect your wishes unless they feel the animals welfare is at risk.<br>  <br>  I would suggest finding a good vet in your area and take her to have her mouth checked out.  It sounds like she is experiencing discomfort and this in itself can cause a shift in your cats personality if it's not treated.  Vets are experienced enough to be able to advise the best course of action for your girl, and if you are not happy after your vets visit, then consider finding another vet.<br>  <br>  You can always voice your concerns with your vet and ask their advice about sedation.  Perhaps you can contact a couple of Persian breeders in your area for a recommendation of a good veterinary practice.<br>  <br>  I also don't over vaccinate my cat and she is an outdoor cat - and my vet completely respects my wishes.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps :0)|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	to be honest shaving a cat with out sedation isn't a good idea as it can traumatise the cat having said that my persian when i had her we shaved her without it was ok as someone came to my home but she cried the whole time so i would nt recommend it vets can give her a little sedation and then wake her up due to her age she will be ok don't worry the sedation now is safer than it was before but talk to the vet first and see what he says

JGq9rKBOaa	Yes, gerbils are much happier in pairs. Two gerbils won't take up more space than one, and happy gerbils also tend to be friendlier and more fun to watch than a lone gerbil. You'll get to see their normal social behaviors, and generally having company makes them a bit less scared and more comfortable in their environment. <br>  <br>  If you only want one pet, I'd recommend getting a Syrian hamster instead of a gerbil - those won't suffer if left alone. In fact, they prefer it!|`|jyGTlpzTaa	It is much better to keep them in same sex pairs or groups if they are female...they get very lonely alone!|`|BVcKu21laa	If you give it a lot of handling and attention then one will be fine, but if  your working long hours or going to school.... I would recommend getting two.  Gerbils are very sociable critters and crave attention all the time, whether it's from you or one from it's own kind. Like the others said, getting two doesn't mean more work, it just means that no matter what you are doing, your little friend will never be alone. <br>  Also I found that males are a lot more laid back then females.|`|xarKlp0Oaa	No you don't have to get 2. You can get 2 if you want to keep the other one company but My gerbils preferred to be by themselves and when I got 2 of them they didn't get along so then I had to go buy another cage.|`|BWez86Ldaa	I would imagine. In general, small animals, especially rodents, tend to be extremely sociable!|`|g6RIchtuaa	No.  As long as a gerbil has a wheel and enough toys they should be fine by themselves.
9kceDOTraa	Depends on the cichlid actually.  You need to realize tht the word cichlid doesn't hold as much in common with all the different species out there as you think.  Does a Puma that lives in a jungle have the same needs as say a Cheetah that lives out in the open range?  Both are cats though, so why do they have different needs?<br>  <br>  The same things apply to "cichlids"  South American cichlids have almost completely opposite needs as African cichlids, as well, have different sizes and diets too.  You can't use the word cichlid here as an all encompassing aspect.<br>  <br>  The key word you have in caps is NEED, and based on that word, then even the Africans which benefit the most from the higher pH and hardness, based on the word NEED, then NO THEY DON'T NEED IT.  If you use it, that's great, but need?  No not even close.<br>  <br>  I use simple gravel in all my African tanks, I suppliment the hardness (GH and KH) by use of Wonder Shells, and Rift Lake salts.  Crushed Coral would give you a pretty good boost in your KH, but do very little to raise your GH.  That's another thing.  Keep in mind when you talk about water being hard, it's both the GH and KH you need to look at, not just one or the other.<br>  <br>  So do the Africans need it?  Nope they don't, especially not if your water is already high in pH and hardness.  By far the South Americans don't need it in any way at all, and Central Americans, have about the same needs as Africans for the most part.<br>  <br>  Deak Oekaki, have you ever checked the typical pH you find in the ocean?  Most certainly the addition of salts, since salt in itself isn't just only NaCl, impacts and influences the pH.  It is because of salt actually that the typical pH in the oceans is much higher.|`|ftvxAS3saa	all i ahd was fresh water, never added chemicals or anything to my chiclid tank they started having babies so im guess my water was in the right spot.   <br>  <br>  get the fish see how they do test the water if u see them acting funny an talk to some one from a mom an pop fish store dont go to petsmart or petsupermarket|`|hIyjdXr9aa	The term "Cichlid" encompasses a wide variety of fish.  Each individual species has different water parameter requirements.  For example, firemouth cichlids prefer basic water that is around 7.5.  The pH of a water tells you how basic or acidic it is.  Water that has a 7.0 pH is neutral, water that is greater than seven is basic, and water that is less than seven is acidic.  For example, water that has a pH of 8 is basic, and water that has a pH of 6.5 is acidic.  Another example:  most soda pop is around a 3 pH, making it acidic.  <br>  <br>  The reason why people recommend coral substrate is that coral is made out of shells that, when put in fresh water, gently buffer the water into the basic range of pH.  This keeps the pH above seven and does so gradually, so as not to stress the fish.  Driftwood and leaves added to the substrate are often used when an acidic aquarium is needed to keep the fish comfortable.  <br>  <br>  Research the type of cichlid that you want, find out the recommended pH for that species, and use a substrate or tank additive that helps you keep this pH constantly without fluctuations.  Certain water droplets sold in pet stores can increase or decrease pH, but these are sudden changes and may stress the fish.  Add them gradually.  There are many methods of raising the aquarium pH to keep base-loving species of cichlids happy; you don't necessarily need coral substrate, but you do need to keep the pH at the right level for your species of fish.  Choose the method of creating the water parameters your fish needs that is easiest for you.  :)  <br>  <br>  Dear other answerer:  Table salt is composed of NaCl, anti-caking agents, and iodine.  The boxes marked "freshwater aquarium salt" in pet stores are usually just NaCl without the iodine and anti-caking agents.  Adding either of these salts to an aquarium does not change its pH.  Marine salt has pH altering stuff added to it on purpose, and is different.|`|eJ97Qdooaa	No, they don't.  But it wouldn't hurt to have coral substrate.  The people i know with cichlids tanks have normal gravel substrates and their fishes are very healthy.
sSJ8zfebaa	snakes should not be housed together|`|XXjcHdxxaa	You should be able to. You will hear people say that you shouldnt house any snakes together, and this is true because it can prevent fighting, but it really depends on your snakes. most likely the females will be fine with the male addition. I would reccomnd at least a 20 gallon and they have place to hide if they feel threatened. Also they love the sand as bedding. :)
DtkLsetkaa	Get him chipped when you get him neutered, so you only have to pay for 1 vet visit mainly, but also that way he doesn't feel a thing when the chip goes in.  Its just like a shot, and they actually don't feel much pain, but why cause anything unnecessary when you can just get it done when you are getting him fixed.  Good thinking getting that done by the way!!!  Microchipping is a wonderful thing :)|`|3Acalpmhaa	we got my cat and dog chiped when they were both fully awake.  apparently, it doesnt hurt that bad, so i guess u could awit until he/she is sedated, but if u did it now, it wouldnt hurt them that badly, and it would be over in a matter of seconds.  good luck!<br>  ~jenny|`|C1HZCLqTaa	I've actually read differently than others that have posted on your question. The needle they use to put the chip in is actually quite large, because of what has to go through it. It is not the normal sized needle that gives regular shots. Cats hide pain very well, so it may not look like it hurts, but it can actually be quite painful. Think if it were to happen to you! You may not flinch, but it doesn't mean it doesn't hurt. Even if the cat is asleep while this is done, the spot may be sore for him or her for a while once they are awake.<br>  <br>  Also, although micro-chipping can be a great thing if your cat gets lost, look into who uses it around your city. I live in a semi-large city but the pound does not scan for microchips, while other places do. If your cat gets picked up by a place that doesn't have a scanner, or their scanner is for a different brand of microchip (they aren't all the same) or even if you plan to move in the future, it won't do any good if it is in there and isn't being used. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	I had my adult cat chipped without any sedation and he did fine - he didn't flinch.  Most cats don't even feel it.  But if you are more comfortable with it, you can have him chipped when he is neutered.  Even if he does feel it, it is just for a quick moment, just like when you get a shot.
iJtuhLMTaa	Listen to you mom and wait to get a new cat.  Introducing a new cat to the household if your current cat is that old would likely stress her to the point of being detramental to her health|`|B8j7pA6baa	Show them that you take good care of you first cat.  Whats wrong with a cat named Bob?|`|nxKmMuFQaa	tell your mum that a kitten will help your cat   sometimes with animals bringing a young animal, such as the kitten into the house makes the older animal more happier and gives it more energy plus the kitten will be company for the older cat.    i have 6 horses, 2 dogs, 2 cats, a hamster, 3 snakes, and 3 fish  so my mum would never let me get any more animals but as i have t cats i know they like eachothers company and learn things from eachother.|`|b3d93887c70268407904f1afcd1f88faaa	Don't get a kitten until your other one has died. A kitten will be full of energy and bug your older cat to play with it. This can cause more stress on your older cat.    Just give the cat you have now a lot of love while shes still with you
NnYB9eXiaa	Hi :)    I've had hamsters hang on for the ride on some wheels and spin in circles - he'll be fine.    He'll adjust to the speed on it - and congrats on the silent spinner - they're my favorite wheel - you'll be glad you got it!    Robos are super hyper and he'll probably climb up his cage and jump off the bars and all sorts of stuff (if he hasn't already)    He may get dizzy from flying off the wheel, but he won't be hurt - just make sure nothing big like his house is in the projectile path ;)    Have fun!    Daisy|`|J7o7FtZdaa	It should be fine my hamsters flip off there a wheel all the time and there fine and u should just keep ur wheel i would love to have a silent wheel for my hamsters.|`|An2AopAqaa	hmm, poor hammy. Wheels are such a nuisance! If I could have found a silent one I would have used it. Your hamster will just have to learn to slow down. He may even be doing it on purpose!     My hamster Ginger used to swing from the top bars of her 2ft cage and let go, dropping from the top and hitting the floor at the bottom! I worried about her at first but she just kept doing it and doing it so I left her to it. lol|`|Pi6O8xmMaa	no because if he gets flipped of if it is to hard it could stop his heart and kill him so if i were you get a new wheel for you hamster.|`|GaSK15Kpaa	Hmm I have a silent spinner and have never had any problems. You could try tightening it so its harder for him to run and so he runs slower. Other than that he'll have to learn to slow down. Or maybe he enjoys swinging round and round.     Lucinda|`|qAoWgQbRaa	Ha don't worry bout it.  My dwarf hamsters tend to enjoy themselves in the same way; one of them loves to do exactly what you described, and the other climbs until he's hanging upside down from the top of his cage then jumps. They love doing it, and I think it just gives them a thrill.  The idea of tightening the wheel to make it run slower is a very good idea if you're still worrying. Anyhow, have fun with your hamster. :)|`|j4JpA35Qaa	sounds like he is just entertaining himself|`|i2qwJMfRaa	i know i  shoudnt laugh but this is really funni  this happend with mi hamster aswell   it's perfectly fine he'll get used 2 it and slow down
UEIAV00Jaa	you can but probobly don't want to. they are a little slimy and they excrete a poison that can make you sick if you make them mad. also you handling them could make them fataly sick. overall its best not to hold them; it would be stressful on your animal and not worth the risk of death or illness|`|CdRlOsnyaa	the salt on your skin can be harmfull but in plentyful amounts if yo dont have gloves let her hold it for now just not everyday and make sure her hands are really clean befor and after handling, i hope she has great fun with your toad good luck|`|vS1Z0inOaa	It's true that salt on your skin can harm the toad and that the toad excretes a poison (all toads do to some extent). However, you'd have to have alot either way for it to harm someone.     If your niece washes her hands before handling the toads, that'll reduce the salt in her hands. Then she can handle it for awhile, but still not every day. The poson that firebellied toads is not strong enough to affect people although it an affect dogs or cats and a few people are allergic to it. So when she's done with the toad she should go straight to the bathroom and wash her hands again. No stopping to say hello to the dog if she has one ;) She should wash anyway because of salmonella (but that goes for all reptiles and amphibians).     It's true that at first handling will stress the toads, but that's true of any animal that has never been handled. I strongly recommend handling all animals you can because there will come a time when you have to--like when you're cleaning the tank or there's something wrong and you need to get a good look at him or you accidentally dropped something bad into the tank or whatever-- and then it'll be easier both on you and the animal... Over time they get used to it and know you're not going to hurt them.     I've found that if you cup both hands over the toads they feel trapped and get scared and squeeze through your fingers. However, when a toad wants to jump they must first stick their nose up in the ir and spread their legs out. The way to hold them that keeps them from jumping out of your hand from an alarming height and doesn't seem to frighten them too much is to let the toad sit on your open palm and then rest your thumb across the end of his nose in front of his eyes and hold his nose down (not hard, just don't let him stick it up into the "I'm gonna jump" position). My toads don't seem to fight to get away so much when I hold them this way.     Firebellied toads are great pets, and I hope your niece enjoys them :) She certainly can hold it, just not too much.|`|LoMohYh0aa	You don't want to hold them not because they're poisonous but because the salts on your skin can harm them, you can let your niece hold it while wearing latex gloves but this is usually only recommended for when you clean there tank.|`|46Mxaw13aa	true the salts on your hand can harm them and they are also loaded with salmonella and if she didn't wash her hands and accidently licked her fingers she could get sick but the truth is even if you use a glove that they just do not like to be handled they will jump right off of your hand and if you close your hand they squeeze right through your fingers.
bEQn0Vrtaa	You must allow your self to morn, the loss of a pet is like the loss of a child. Please do not make the mistake of thinking you have to be strong, you have to go through all the stages of morning until you reach acceptance. It takes all of us a different amount of time. Getting a new guinea pig will not help, i made that mistake once and i expected the new one to have the exceptional personality of the one that had just passed of old age. Wait until you have gotten over the depth of the suffering before getting another OK . Please know it is OK to be in pain it was a very big part of your live, their is nothing on earth like the love that a guinea pig will give you.    May God be with you|`|7SJ3cY48aa	Awww, I'm so sorry for your lost. I had two guinea pigs, they both died last year. But it does get better keep yourself busy and get a good nights sleep, you will feel better in the morning. x|`|wdmp9eYXaa	i'm sorry to hear about the death of your guinea pig. pets can quickly become part of your family and it does not matter what kind of pet it is. the worst thing that you can do is rush out and buy another pet. you need time to mourn the passing of your pet. then when you feel that the time is right then go out and buy you a new pet. then you won't be buying a replacement pet but a new pet that you can bond with because you wanted a new pet and not a replacement one. again so sorry about the death of your pet. Many Blessings to you!|`|MaAtfDV7aa	interact with humans|`|n99NOgHJaa	Aww , I am so sorry !! There isn't much you can do to get over a loss of a pet, really all can do is wait for time to pass. Maybe do things that you really enjoy still . If you have other pets ,spend time with them. Go out with your friends , find things that make you laugh. I am not trying to say that you should totally forget about your little guy , but to try and make the best of it. You've had fun with him/her I am sure so think about that if it comes to mind.|`|BCZ1ezXMaa	when my turtle died, i waited about a week, and bought a gerbil. i didnt name him anything near my turtles name. you dont have to get a guinea pig, you can get any animal.  im so sorry, and i know it breaks your heart.  i still sometimes cry about it, but im glad i can actually cuddle with my gerbil|`|oFTbqICiaa	i'm sry. that stinks.  get another one and bury your other one that died and have a ceremony|`|MpVQE8tnaa	Give youself some time........I lost a gp a few month back.  My new gp Marilyn (namesake: Marilyn Van Derbur--Miss America 1958) is a sweet little princess and I LOVE HER SO MUCH    There will be room in your heart for another GP if you want one....give yourself time    You'll come across another one that you can love....I always do--Have had 13 guinea pigs|`|nVHsbHiaaa	get another 1|`|CvLwS9p5aa	I agree with leo leo. when my mouse passed away recently, i waited a week then i bought a hamster. i felt much better. also, a few years back, i read a happy book. it worked so well, i hardly felt bad at all. also, if you have any pictures of your guinea pig, keep them hidden for a while until you feel happy again, then wait a bit longer.
iQqsdl5yaa	I had a few ferrets awhile ago and one of them got that and it ended up being that she was constipated and basically was trying too hard to go and it caused basically a hernia...you can buy some ointment for it that will make it go down...thats my guess but if it seems to start bothering her, take her to the vet just in case it is something worse.|`|44kEtDvIaa	You can try site below and see if you can match the symptoms to the health articles.  Also has few other links for ferrets health and you may be able to find something there.  Keep an eye on it and if gets larger, or if your ferret starts to show signs out of her ordinary behavior, see the vet.|`|whg557P5aa	Worms of some variety?|`|6TXiBrXOaa	Maybe its a wart  Good luck
86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	Nothing eats poopy, and every critter also poops so nothing will really do any cleaning. As well as the RES quite possibly eating anything that's put in with it, especially any fish or shrimp.    Instead, improve your filtration and up water changes.|`|rrLHU6ehaa	None.  You're it.  Do 50-70% water changes twice a week, AND remove Bubbles from her tank to a separate area for feeding.  This will help keep the water clean longer.|`|0c5e60ce4b8fdd00c644bddf68b7f9caaa	What Catx said, siphon the water and do weekly changes,and don't get any in your mouth, Bubbles probably carries Salmonella ,y'know.|`|bIh5ZFwIaa	nothing will clean a fish tank appart from you    go buy a glass scraper magnet thing, and clean it your self, no other way arround it, and a gravel vac will do the "poopy"|`|cToJQNknaa	They aren't fish that eat poop. Also anything you put in their be it fish or snails the turtle will eat. The best thing to do is to get a stronger filtration system and do water changes. Turtles are very messy and its something that just comes with the territory in owning them.
uctxzjIIaa	I knew a cat who had a very sensitive spine, so you could only pet him along his back if you were *very* gentle. It wasn't really a medical problem, just an oddity for that cat.|`|V4D6ocfzaa	I've had this problem before. Don't touch the cat there, the cat will most likely stop hissing and squealing in a few weeks to months.|`|mTTPLly4aa	shes hurt take her to a vet|`|3c49a0964bbe36e70dcf40e56a9d58d6aa	That just might the one spot she hates to be touched.|`|YCjVx75baa	maybe she just doesn't like being touched there. some cats are touchy like that. Theres really not much you can do besides take her to the vet again for another check up.|`|fBMSIlSIaa	Nothing is "wrong." I think that cats might think you're going to like puller their tail or touch it, which obviously they don't like.
AA11457471	Confine your cat to the area the litterbox is in till you see he'll use it regularly. If you give him access to the whole house right away you may be sorry.  If he's not neutered please have him done ASAP. Unneutered males tend to spray urine to mark their territory even if they're using the litterbox. They can't help it- it's nature calling.  Keep the cut clean with warm water & a drop of tearless baby shampoo. Don't use peroxide on it.  Good luck!|`|bxlYleZkaa	Just show him where it is and he will use it when he is ready.|`|acb7W30saa	Cats are prone to using litter boxes anyway, even really little kittens will naturally use a litter box.  All you really should have to do is introduce him to the litter box, and if he looks like he's digging around the floor for a place to do his business quickly pick him up and put him in the litter box, also if you don't catch him and time and just find a little pile waiting for you then just pick that up, put it in the litter box and then show your cat.  It may take a few tries but he should pretty quickly figure it out.  Oh and by the way put the litter box somewhere that is easy for him to find that will help.|`|3c49a0964bbe36e70dcf40e56a9d58d6aa	Put him in his litter box a few times and he'll catch on.  Cats are one of the easiest animals to potty train.  Using a litter box is in a cat's instincts so it shouldn't take but a few times for him to know where to go to the bathroom.
velIdcbNaa	The length is just fine.  ^.^    Well what you should do is go to your local dog park.  Don't force her to interact.  If you have friends with pets, then have them come over, or borrow the pet.  Let them loose.  Your dog will probably go and hide, but that is just fine.  Let her warm up at her own pace.  It may take a long time to do, and she may never get over it, but you have to let her move at her own pace.  The worst thing you can do is force her along.  This is more likely to cause anger problems, and we don't want that.  I have know several timid dogs, and I told their owners to do the same thing, and well the dogs are not dog lovers.      The longest time this took was over a year, but this dog came from very bad places.  It was not cared for, and it was even scared of people.  The most you can do while letting them stay in their comfort zone is let them adjust at their own rate.    Best of luck!|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	There is no reason not to take her to classes.  If the class is properly managed she should not be harassed by the other dogs, and it will give her a chance to be around them in a controlled environment without having to interact with them.    Discuss your issues with the instructor before signing up.|`|htSZsds7aa	You are an angel in disquise for taking in this poor pup. She may never get comfortable with other dogs,but how is she with Mini foxie? which i assume is another dog.  A good personal dog trainer might help.|`|oTSUPCEnaa	She need socialization..slowly...if u have a freind that has a very stable dog, low key that is, bring the dog to your house and aloow your dog to come to the dog on her own terms..best to keep her on a leash, just for safety. if she is around a stable dog then the energy of the stable dog will help her overcome her fear, also remember your energy will affect her too, if you are tense, frustrated ect, she feels it and that makes her more uptight. out side , you might try to set with her on a leash out sied so she gets used to the sounds and things around her, talk calmly and assuring to her too.. You might watch  NGC. the dog whisperer, ceasar is great and i have used lots of his techniques and they do work... lots if luck to you and your family
p3vjvzRPaa	6 weeks is too young for a pup to leave her mother, but not much you can do about that now. :-)    Given your breeder clearly wasn't the most consientious it is worth checking that she is healthy overall.  Take her to your vet for a general check up and worming.    But to answer your actual question :-) ...    Cows milk can cause diarhoea in many dogs.  Best to avoid it - an upset tummy will only make her less interested in food.    In general, adding things to food to make it extra tasty is not the best solution for a healthy dog.    It is normal for pups to go off their food when they first leave their mum and littermates.  You should be feeding her the same type of food she had before you got her so that it is familiar to her - your breeder should have given you information and a small supply.  You should also have an idea of how often to feed her each day.    Remember too that a tiny puppy needs only very little food - new owners often forget how tiny that tummy is and fret when the pup only eats a small amount.    If she is healthy and the food is a food she is used to eating than starting to try to make the food extra yummy to make her eat can be a bad habit to start.  A normal dog is not going to let themselves starve to death.  She will eat when she is hungry enough.  Dogs are smart and learn very quickly that if they turn their nose up at the food the next meal is extra yummy...before you know it you have a very fussy eater for life.    Good luck with her.|`|htSZsds7aa	yes, but only about 1/4 cup. cows milk will give her the poops.  Check with your vet, she may have worms and not hungry.|`|Rva0ocMOaa	It is hard for them to digest, so it is not recommended. You can soften up her food with warm water though.|`|HFqiY6BGaa	yes you can give anything cows milk. a puppy, idk.|`|QUkXsPNIaa	Cows milk is bad for dogs.    Puppy replacement milk from a pet shop is best, goats milk if your in a pinch.|`|Kp5BOhNVaa	Buy puppy formula if you'd like. Mix it with the food, or just mix food with warm water.     Why on earth do you have a 6 week old puppy, at the very least they shouldn't be sold until 8 weeks old.    Goodluck with your new pup ^^|`|aHn6mbLdaa	Your six week old puppy does not need cows milk. I'm guessing the mother is no longer nursing her pups? At six weeks you little one will do fine on a good quality puppy food. You might have to soften it a lttle at first with water but a golden is a pretty good size dog and should be able to eat it dry pretty quick. Don't forget you little one need a supply of clean water to drink. Good luck with your puppy.|`|e3bbea72940dc8ddb89cf1c33bdc265aaa	Some dogs get allergies and you'd be able to tell if that was the case if she gets an upset stomach.. if she gets the dire-rear stop the milk|`|2uRLrv4Kaa	Ive had 3 dogs and Ive never fed them any kind of milk.|`|3giaPYe8aa	No, don't mix milk with the puppy food.  If anything, you might just want to add a little water and warm the food in the microwave for a very short time.  Anything that is warm will bring out the smell and flavor of the food.  Even a teaspoon of canned food would be OK, but I wouldn't go too far with this, or you will turn her into a finicky eater.  People always say "my dog won't eat its food".  That's because they have spoiled the dog too much.
3c49a0964bbe36e70dcf40e56a9d58d6aa	Unfortunately, outside cats don't live as long, but there are exceptions to every rule.  Being outside does expose her to more disease and you risk your cat accidentally being hit by a car.  I once worked at a vet's office and the oldest cat I saw there lived to be 23 years old.  My parents have all outdoor cats and the oldest one is about to turn 17.  If your cat is in relatively good health I'm sure she still has a lot of years left in her.|`|IzRk1mZQaa	The oldest cat I ever saw was a 17 year old siamese.  My cat now lived most of his life outside, and he's 12, and he is in great shape, but I make him live indoors now.  Our vet said that my cat was the healthiest outdoor cat he'd ever seen, so its very possible!!!|`|AA12398420	Poor kitty, living outdoors she has much stress and fear to deal with. Most outdoor kitties die early in life because of too many dangers, even in the country. So she has been very lucky.  Cats can live to be 36, the oldest recorded. I have one that is 24, 17, 15 and 13. Cats live a lot longer than they used to. My success rate is due to them living indoors, quality food and lots of love.  I also care for feral cats that live in my backyard and I have a couple that are over 10 years old. But my yard has special fencing to keep them safe inside and dogs and other predators outside my yard.|`|MZ8uqhNEaa	Usually cats live to be 14-16. They don't have nine lives, but usually land on their feet because of hairs in their inner ears. They tell cats that they are upside down, so the turn their head and since they have such a short neck bone, the shoulders and spine follow. They use their tail for balance, and their soft padded feet help them land. :)    Since your cat is outside, it will probably only live to be 14. Maybe not even that long, but I bet she will live that long, or more.    I hope I helped!   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  The Animal Lover     (I changed my name it is now Animal Lover, in really weird writing. Also "Animal Lover" and the girl symbol in Greek. Plus the church sign.)|`|fBMSIlSIaa	Cats can live up to 25 but usually 15-20. I think you should keep her inside. You never know what can happen. You dont want to take the rist. You know they say outside cats live shorter lives. Do you know why? Because even if its not a neighborhood with lots of cars, they DO go by, dogs DO get loose, other cats ARE in the neighborhood and DO fight with other cats.|`|U5IigAByaa	cats are living longer and longer these days, the most extreme case i know of is 20yrs. but average is about 16 i think.  you have lots of happy cat years left!|`|wq6lfHIBaa	Cats live a long time, thats why its so important to chose a pet wisely! I would keep her inside as she gets older just to protect her! Cats live about 15 years or so, enjoy her while she is with you and i wish her many more years of happiness!!! with love!|`|9IH2Hdlqaa	I'm no sure whats the average but my Grandmother's cat is 20.  She used to go outside a lot when she was younger but has been staying indoors the past few years.|`|9syKx5Mlaa	please keep your cat inside.  The only reason I am saying this is because I had a outside cat. And he was my best friend he was like a cat and a dog mixed together. He would wait for me everyday after school in the driveway or basking in mine or my neighbors yard ( dont worry they didnt mind they actually really liked him) And he was so much fun because he loved the snow and every season.  He even brought me a bird once , and incase ou dont know in cat language if they bring you a animal that means they really really really like you.And one day I had to get my hair cut he was waiting on my porch, but I couldnt say hi and bye because I was late for my appointment and when I came back and he ws gone. But that was normal so I didnt worry one bit. But sadly that was the last time I saw him. I am thinking that someone picked him up and kept him because I didnt find him at the shelters or on the side of the road dead ( I hate saying that word when it comes to him) But I had no luck i didnt have time with school to aske door to door so I didnt. He was a very loving cat to every one but escically me. that is why I think someone picked him up plus he had the prettiest long fur and had an orange body and white paws and chest with a cute little swirl on his head.    But that is just my advice so you dont get your heart broken.     The average age of cats inside lifespan has been about 17 years.  The average lifespan of an outdoor cat would be about six years.|`|kOsJ63KFaa	I hear the oldest cat lives in Texas and was born in 1967. Who knows if its true, but I just looked up the world record oldest cat.  But you should expect a good 18-20 years, unless some fool runs it over.|`|bxlYleZkaa	I had a rescue cat years ago which lived to be at least 18. More recently two others lived to be 16 and 17 respectively. Both got kidney disease and had to be put down. Current three are only youngsters.

AA10029366	You might try PetEdge -- I've never had a complaint about their shipping costs...but then, I live relatively close to their Reno, NV warehouse.    It's worth a look:  http://www.petedge.com|`|HgRYP3cJaa	I'm lucky enough to have many dog supply stores around.  Try petfooddirect.com    Otherwise, if you have relatives or friends living in the states, it may be cheaper for them to buy it and ship it to you.    Make sure NOT to buy cheeez made anywhere but the US!    Best of luck to you!|`|pc7ZjexJaa	Lol  I was gonna say that either petco or petsmart has the bottomless bowl thing    But I guess that won't work :-/    Do you have a farming store around you?  We get great toys and treats from farm and fleet in IL    But I have no idea about where you're from  My aunts friend lives in the same state as you...I can see if I can get a hold of her|`|Yu7y6yfraa	Wow, your home is twice as big as the one I grew up in.  I bet you have everything there.  Just kidding........    I have been using Upco for about 15 years.  They are located in Missouri.  If you go to their website, you can have them send you one of their catalogs.  It has a lot more stuff in it than they have on their website.  Over a certain amount ( about $75 or less, the shipping and handling cost is free).  At least is true for my shipments to CA.  It may be different to Alaska.  I also order my dogs' vaccines through them.    Also, if you get a catalog, you can call toll free and order over the phone.  I have found them to be very knowledgeable about their products when contacting them.    Their ship extremely fast with their regular shipping service.|`|n4ZIrNLnaa	If you are looking for puppy pads...check out the source below...we have had great reviews and responses to these pads.|`|cnZlMojUaa	I've used dog.com before and been pleased. You might want to look at that site and compare prices. I don't think you get the free ship option in Alaska though.|`|ERjGLJaEaa	I LOVE J-B Wholesale. You can look online at their site at jbpet.com. They also have a magazine that comes to my home! Good luck!|`|lhOd2hvXaa	I tend to use Upco (upco.com) or Revival (revivalanimal.com).  They seem to be the most reasonable for both product-prices and shipping rates.  I am in the midwest though and that may make a difference.    Good Luck!
D1vZXuziaa	You'll need more females otherwise the males will "over sex" them and kill them... That's what happened too a friend of mines and the poor little girl in my brothers tank. Depends on the size of the tank as too how many females though but at least 5 females to even it out a little more....  Good luck!|`|AA11708471	you want atleast 2 females per male|`|cXK9sY1raa	With livebearers, like guppies, aim for three females to every male, and at the very least two. The stress of being chased and constantly pregnant will kill females very quickly. Why not add another two males instead?|`|dD08pRIwaa	You have to add even more. You have to have 3 females for every male to not cause stress.|`|adPO2SVraa	that is totally impossible  You cant or the females will die|`|ssHzAVlwaa	You want it to at least be even. usually it is 2 girls per 1 male. 2 females may not be enough. if the tank is large enough get 8 females. That'll be good.|`|i5Zfm94Xaa	depends on the size of the tank but otherwise i think that they will do ok. so what is the size of the tank?

So yes I do.|`|acb7W30saa	My dog (beagle) doesn't need human permission to help warm you up, she's such a cuddler that she will park herself right on top of you.  That's not a problem when it's winter and it's cold, but it's not good when the little space heater decides to sit on you during the summer.|`|fBMSIlSIaa	Yeah I snuggle with my lab and shihtzu:)
8NSh1D4Maa	It's certainly possible to have a dog that is reliably obedient and well-mannered with training and practice.  However, do make sure that you allow your dog to be a dog, have fun, and express their natural personality as well.  If you want a 100% perfect dog, get a robot, it's the only way you'll get that.  Depending on the dog, having a well-mannered companion can take a lot of work or not so much.  I have one that I've spent countless hours on training with him and quite a few rounds of obedience class that is naturally exuberant with the attention span of a gnat, and enjoys 'providing his own fun' if the activities I did with him that day aren't entertaining enough.  He will probably never be perfectly behaved, but he does know his commands and executes them properly once you have his attention.  My other dog I've had to spend very little time on 'training', though I did have to spend a lot of time on socialization.  She walks perfectly on lead, doesn't jump up; sit, down, and stay took about half an hour total to train, and she never causes any trouble or gets into things she shouldn't.  So, what I'm saying is, expect large individual variations between individual dogs and between breeds as well.  Think about kids, is it 'possible' to have a perfectly behaved kid?  Probably.  But they will all make mistakes and the road to a basically good kid who listens can be a lot different for one child than another.|`|VPycXVIlaa	I don't see why not. Give it a shot and see how it goes. Training takes a lot of patience and repetition. If you are diligent you should be able to train the dog to do a lot of things.|`|Z0GfGZtJaa	Do you want it trained for shows? If so, call a training class and enroll.  Do you   want it trained to be a great companion>? If so, teach it no more hat 2 commands, be consistent  Dogs can learn more than 200 words so, start naming all her items...toy,bed,food, and so on.  Never hit with your hands, a rolled up newspaper and a water filled squirt bottle work great. Always use positive reinforcement.  Expectations are unlimited.|`|qS2ugtlNaa	yes|`|XK9RLaPeaa	If you are saying that your dog is well behaved but you still want to train it then yes. Try clicker training him. This is a great positive reinforcement method, and the dog enjoys learning this way. Even if the dog minds and behaves well, you can still teach him to sit, stay, roll over, etc.   www.clickerlessons.com  This is a good website to learn how to do this. You have to read the whole thing though, or you wont understand the science behind it. Good luck!|`|enC9TvxUaa	-Sure, they'll slip up from time to time, just like people do!  But, with proper training, he will know what is expected of him.  A properly trained dog ends up being much happier as he knows the rules, can follow them, and not be in trouble all the time!|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	In order for the dog to be perfect, YOU must be perfect.|`|nPuZVGFRaa	Well if its already perfectly trained then there isn't much you can do?  Be more specific|`|Rva0ocMOaa	Could you reword this? I am not sure what you are trying to ask, though it is quite possible to train a dog well if you do it properly. Nothing is perfect, by the way.|`|hRikwc00aa	No dog is completely perfect, but with training you can make yourself a pretty well-behaved dog. It's going to take a lot of time and effort on your part!    Good luck! Feel free to email me if you need help with anything.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Train him to be unbehaved? Not sure I understand your question.|`|htSZsds7aa	if he is perfectly behaved, why train him? Unless you mean tricks and such. Get a good book and go from there.|`|YSVMFcM7aa	Of course! If it's perfectly behaved I would think that would be pretty easy. If their a little tired you might consider letting them have a brake Give them treats for their perfect behavior so they won't get a bad attitude. Don't treat them like if they mess up it's all over. Treat them like normal but make sure their at least succeeding a little. Hope this helps!|`|pc7ZjexJaa	your dog will always need training. always need tune ups      so just always do it    dogs forget just like us    make sure you periodically add train sessions throughout your week.    my girls are great most of the time  but its when *I* dont have the time to keep them top shape is when they end up 'slipping up'|`|6Ehb9r1kaa	Oh for sure!

wq6lfHIBaa	They will continue jumping high, but it will be harder as they are fater.  Cats are pregnant for about 9 weeks give or take a few days, we have a cat that is well pregnant and she is jumping high while waddling, so cute!!!!|`|bxlYleZkaa	They will become less acrobatic as time goes on, mainly because of the extra weight theyre carrying.|`|IzRk1mZQaa	Normal Gestation is anywhere from 6 to 9 weeks, averaging around 8.  A pregnant female will normally take good care of herself, she really can't help but to when she gets big, but if she gets scared or startled, she will definitely try anything to get out of harms way, so you might want to keep her activities restricted a bit.   As for the non pregnant, I have a high shelf in my living room, maybe 7 feet up, and I constantly find my cat up there!!|`|velIdcbNaa	Well pregnant cats have a lot of extra weight, so hey won't be able to jump as high, and you should try to keep them from jumping a lot so they do not harm the kittens inside.  My dog is pregnant, and we have to limit her activities so the pups aren't harmed.
XK9RLaPeaa	Never just place two Guinea Pigs in a cage together. They are very territorial, and will attack each other, sometimes fight til the death. Please introduce them in neutral ground, this will keep the old one from being territorial over his cage. They might never get along though, so you should be prepared to get another cage.   http://www.cavyspirit.com/fighting.htm|`|cIuHgdFWaa	You are not suppose to handle them for a week after you get them. And for them both being in the same cage what you should do is keep them in seperate cages for now and just slowly introduce them outside of their cages until they are really friendly towards each other.    Hope it helps!!
nFcl0BOsaa	Is he a mixed-breed dog? If he's a purebred pit, landlords will know or someone will tell them. I know of apartment buildings in my area that have allowed pit bulls but they are like, 4-unit buildings -- not large complexes. Keep looking, and consider offering to buy a special insurance policy to appease potential landlords.|`|aCqSF87Raa	A lease agreement is a binding legal contract - fibbing or deliberately going against it is grounds for eviction. So if you tried this and the landlord found out, he would be able to evict you and charge you rent for that whole month (as well as the rent for the rest of your lease agreement... i've heard of it happening!)    You're better off finding a place that allows Pit Bull type dogs. If that means moving farther away, so be it. Part of being an adult is doing the right thing and making the right decisions, even if they bring you further away from "home."|`|qEOJzbJraa	I would reccomend you try and rent a single home or nice townhome.     Finding an apartment that will allow a pit bull or pit bull type nowadays is a joke and most landlords who own the property do not want to worry about being slapped with a lawsuit if someone "claims"(doesn't necerssarily have to be the truth) your dog bit someone or themselves. Believe me, it is somewhat difficult to find a place that allows this breed.     Due to personal experience, like I said, you are better off trying to find a nice single home or a townhome.|`|xJgILr5faa	Keep looking animal friendly apt. is out their|`|htSZsds7aa	Pits have a bad rap and for good reason at times. Landlords do not want to worry about  a lawsuit. Many apartments wont allow anything over 15 or 20 lbs. Dont falsify papers, it may backfire.  try to find a small rental single family place with a yard. I had 2 dogs and found a 1 bedroom rental with its own yard.(it was a garage converted to a home)  Would your mom keep him till u find the proper place. or stay w/mom until u can afford to buy a house.  Large dogs should have yards, not 4 walls..|`|C1eHfhrHaa	Why not ask them what their dog policy is without revealing that you have a pit?  Then you can find one that may rent to you, especially if they are an absent landlord.  Unless the lease agreement specifically rules out certain types of dogs (some do)|`|3IApfZopaa	Because of their bad rep a lot of places will not allow certain breeds and it's not just pits.  There are dog friendly complexes see if you can find one in your area.    Good luck|`|EPo7N1xBaa	Don't tell your landlord what kind of dog it is. If they ask tell them he's well-trained and has been to pup classes and if they ask a breed tell them he's a mutt or a lab mix. I've got a 9 year old pit and she's the friendlies dog in the world! Good luck!|`|rPKZSyHJaa	IDK if they did they wold be lying.|`|6xf1GfbUaa	I don't think it's a good idea to have your vet change his breed on the paperwork.. it can have bad consequences for you down the line. I suggest renting a house or a town home instead of an apartment from an "apartment complex". Some home owners won't mind you having a Pit Bull especially if you show proof of him being on puppy classes. It will be hard to find a place though. I know people who just DON'T say they have a dog when they sign the contract for their lease. It's risky, but if your dog is well behaved and is not loud, you might be able to pull it off. IT'S A BIG RISK THOUGH.. and honestly I don't recommend it. I think you should stay at your mom's place until you can Buy your own place. Good luck!
bBG6dcQWaa	that's a good question my question keeps getting deleted too i haven't violated anything either...someone might have reported it for no good reason is what im thinking
Rx7wv4JLaa	1) puppies start getting feed puppy food around the same time their mother should be weaning them off her milk which is around 4-5 weeks.     2) At first it should be watered down a little b/c their teeth are not strong enough at this point. By 6 weeks they can be fed solid.     3) Each area and vets do it slightly different then the next. In my area the first shots are given at 8 weeks, then 12 then 16 then a year.     4)Most breeders let them go at 8 weeks... however some prefer to wait until 10-12 weeks. Ones who do this also do extra training.|`|3IApfZopaa	Puppies are usually ready to eat about 3 - weeks old.  Start them on soft foods you can add cottage cheese or ground chicken to the softened kibble for more flavor.    At 3, 5 and 7 weeks worm the pups, get strongid t from the vet for the whole litter.  Shots at 8, 12 and 16 weeks old.  Puppies should stay with mom till at least 8 weeks for large and medium breeds, 12 weeks for small breeds.|`|wXUkHiqHaa	For shots: 5wks, 6 and 9 wks, 12 wks or older for rabies shot, 12 and 15 wks, and adult. They should also get any d-worming meds before they are adopted.    For when they should eat puppy food: That depends on when the mother is ready. You can always leave her food down and at some point the puppies will start to try a little of their mommy's food. Then it usually isn't long after that she starts to slowly refuse to allow them to nurse from her. You also should have it watered down just a little bit because when they start to eat on their own their teeth are still coming in and getting strong.    For when they are ready to leave their mother: It is best to wait for them to be 8 wks or more. This is because they still need their mother to teach them things and look after them. Plus if they are not fully weaned then they might grow up undernourished and that could lead to a lot of health problems.|`|3zv2bbolaa	1. I begin weaning at around 3.5 weeks with a mixture of Goats Milk, Finely ground puppy food, liver and egg. This mush is warmed and as their deciduous teeth come in more thoroughly I slowly provide a chunkier mix until they are eating a moistened kibble at about eight weeks.     2. I administer the first Parvo/Distemper vaccination at eight weeks of age  I begin worming with Panacur at 2 weeks and continue at 4, 6, and 8 weeks. At eight weeks they receive their first heartworm pill.     3. Pups shouldn't leave their littermates sooner than eight weeks and in some breeds, longer. There are laws in eighteen US states making it illegal to sell underage pups.|`|xJgILr5faa	Parvo /distemper shot now kennel shot next week|`|6CjCaVaXaa	you feed the puppies at the same time as you eat your  dinner lunch and break feast.    and solid food is better then watered down foods.    its good to get the shots as soon as possible    they are ready to leave their mom after 10 weeks|`|C1eHfhrHaa	3 to 3 1/2 weeks- dry food soaked in milk.  first shots about 6 weeks, but that varies a little bit  ready to go at 8 weeks
BaNrweQ4aa	hamsters self-clean and can look a bit weird when they are trying to clean themselves, like trying to get there hands and arms over there head. they clean themselves, and don't need cleaning by humans - this is probably what your hamster is doing. it will find an easier way. if it really does look too weird, speak to your vet about they and get some advice.|`|jDuSXZETaa	hi you would be better off going to your local vet and asking them as there could be quite a few reasons as to why it is doing it.are you sure it isn't just washing itself as my daughter has a hampster and its always washing itself|`|40IUKsC2aa	your brother's hamster may be cleaning it self.go to google and search hamster cleaning itself and see if it looks like that.if it does not it may have gotten hurt so take it to the vet if you are really worried.|`|FOeWqr0qaa	I've had 4 hamsters and they've all moved weirdly. Like others said it probably is just cleaning itself. Honestly though, for the price it costs to take a hamster to the vet and the cost to replace one I'd rather not take it to the vet myself. I took one to the vet and it was $108 just for the vet to look at it, put it in an incubator and have it die there anyway.|`|RtHHHFN5aa	my hamster likes rubbing herself at the bars of her cage so what your hamster might be doing is itching it's self.|`|ktVkRc3Raa	Your pet probably got hurt just a little playing in his cage. The best thing to do if you are really worried is to take your brother's hamster to the vet. The vet will surely tell you what is wrong with your hamster. But just to be sure so you don't go spending money right away, you should wait at least 3 to 4 days and see if his problem gets any better.    Good Luck!!

Like someone else said it sounds like anxiety, what breed is she? Breeds such as abysinnians and peruvians are more high strung and so often more prone to anxiety problems like this. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry too much about this, it sounds like something she'll grow out of. My abby Spike used to suffer from something like this, he was really nervous as a baby because of the way he'd been treated before I got him at the slightest movement he would jump (literally off all fours). My newest guinea pig, Chewie has back leg spasms when you touch a certain spot on his side, his leg goes crazy, but I've been told that he's just got a sensitive nerve and its nothing to worry about.

342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	I've adopted 3 retired racers and fostered many others (including 1 I ended up adopting!).  And yes, they are wonderful, gentle dogs and there are a good many of them who are even cat safe!  The rescues are great at matching up the right dog to the right person.  Of my 3, both my males were both small dog and cat friendly, my female isn't.      All 3 of my greys love kids, drawing the neighborhood kids to them like magnets.  They're very gentle when going up to the smaller kids, they just don't seem to scare them, even if the dogs are taller than the kids!  It's amazing to watch.      I don't know if all the rescues have a strict age restriction, if the one closest to where I live has one, they don't say they do.  What the rescues are most concerned about is the welfare of the dogs - they just don't want a greyhound to ever be involved in biting a child and that could conceivably happen if a greyhound were sleeping and startled by a toddler left unattended with a dog.      It's probably not fair for homes where the parents are conscientious about not leaving young children and dogs unattended, but the rescues concern is for the greyhounds.  You sound like you'd make a great home, so please don't give up!|`|zL1sggpCaa	They are strict because Greyhounds have fragile bones and can snap a leg pretty easily... I mean, easily like your child was just playing with them and boom.... you know? So, that is why they are pretty strict about it.    Its not about your children, it is about the possibility of it happening...|`|oDVx7nSxaa	I adopted my retired dog many, many years ago, when my daughter was only 4.  We had two requirements - the dog we adopted needed to be both cat safe and child safe.  In fact, one of the things that attracted me to greyhounds was their gentle nature.  The only questions our adoption program asked (NGAP) was if my daughter was used to animals - and the answer to that was yes, as we had cats.  They screened the dogs, and eliminated any that were not cat safe and child safe.  Yes, my daughter was quite a bit older than your son, but I agree that raising kids to respect animals is more important than age.      They truly are wonderful and deserving dogs.  I never regretted adopting ours, not for a minute.  The process was typical rescue procedure - references both vet and personal, and a phone interview.      I am very involved in Siamese cat rescue, and we won't place kittens in homes with small children, but a kitten is significantly smaller than a greyhound.|`|pc7ZjexJaa	I haven't  But I know some who have    They are great dogs and it is very rewarding    I no longer speak with these people. But I see one around.   I've always liked their dogs. They are very sweet  But some require a lot of work bc they are scared and don't have much socialization|`|FewhKlx9aa	They won't adopt to you because Greyhounds are breed to race after a small animal at the end of a pole..The small babies would not work out with this type of dog and your little dogs and cats would be food for him..So you will have to wait as there is a lot of training to be done when you get a Greyhound,you have to remember they lived 1 life and never used stairs or been around small children.They are apt to get out and run away..So you will have to wait on this breed till you have the time and patience and your children are older..
kWwgWSSgaa	A prong collar is anything but cruel if used correctly by the handler. It's a training tool & more humane than continually yanking on a dogs neck.    My very muscular male Dobermann is now exercised in a flat collar {unless it's icey & I want the extra control from a half check} I use a half check on my Dobermann b*tch.    The proof is that the training and correction worked, he walks to heel.    Draw your own conclusions once you have read the informative article on prong collars.  http://leerburg.com/prong.htm prong    I would not use the harness to train a dog not to pull. I prefer a prong or half check, neither of which is in any way inhumane if properly used.|`|XK9RLaPeaa	Training is the best way to stop this. Contact an experienced trainer, who uses positive reinforcement methods. Please dont use a choker, or a spike training collar, they are very ineffective, and are inhumane. They can cause collapsed trachea's, and their neck could get injured. If you use something like that, or a "gentle lead" the dog doesn't learn anything, therefore if he doesn't have it on he will behave like this again. Why not teach the dog what is right instead of using objects that they dont understand? Good luck!|`|FewhKlx9aa	There is a product that resembles a muzzle but is called The Gentle Leader..It sells for $19.99 at Petco.They really do work as I had a German Sheperd that needed this for a short while as he was very strong and he had to learn who was the boss..The are gentle and your dog has no prblem with drinking or eating or panting..It works by keeping his head down when he pulls and that makes them not want to do it|`|J1MTGkTCaa	I checked out that website. Since you've actually seen it work and it does what it's supposed to do, then I'd certainly get it.  At $14 that's not a bad price at all.  I personally have used a standard choke collar which has always worked for me in the past, but I think I'll change over to this product and try it.|`|rDLTnjRyaa	Try a pinch collar instead. Get the kind that don't feel sharp to the touch. The best kind are made by Germany. Have a professional show you how to put one on the dog and the proper way to use it. Once that collar is on, you will be in control of the dog. He won't be walking you. As soon as he has the collar on, start training him to heel. It is very easy to do. Don't let him pull or tug. When he gets in front of you, give a quick pull. He will come back to you and as soon as he does get him where he needs to be. Tell him Heel and start walking(slowly at first). It is a great tool for training and for safety. Don't give him a lot of leash until he learns to walk nicely. So rather than searching for a particular leash, which isn't promised to help stop the dog, look for the pinch collar. Choke chains don't work by the way. The dog will keep on pulling even though the chain is choking him. By the way, the pinch collar is not inhumane and cruel. The dog is not going to be uncomfortable wearing one. I encourage you to at least give it a try with your dog before making any assumptions about it. You might be surprised.|`|aCqSF87Raa	"I refuse to use a prong collar. it looks way too inhumane and uncomfortable." Well, loads of good trainers would tell you to try one. It's a lot better than losing control over your dog, who either then ends up hit by a car or you end up with skinned knees as you're pulled along behind him....    In all honesty the only training aid i've ever used that actually works is the prong collar. They don't HURT, they PINCH. Yes it's pretty uncomfortable, but only when the dog pulls or lunges. That's the whole point of them. If the dog is walking calmly beside you then they feel nothing from the collar.    The harnesses are for craps - yes, even the one you saw on TV. It doesn't really stop the pulling and i've seen dogs back right out of them (if they twist around and shift their legs just right, they pop out.)|`|Ee2fwrqoaa	Why not take your dog to a training class in your area.  Your local kennel club can refer you to one.  I don't believe in using crutches, such as the one you mentioned.|`|q1Swxe3qaa	You can use a choke collar, or the ones when the prongs on it. That should keep him from pulling. We use a choke collar for our big dog, and he stopped pulling within a day!|`|yJqXmy8Caa	my friend has one on her dog but it still pulls her down the road, so no i does'nt work. have you tried a check chain?|`|qexKY00naa	I have this leash for my 45lb. Lab mix!! It DOES NOT PREVENT them from pulling but it does dramatically reduce the pull on you! It makes walking easier but it doesn't train the dog anything!    I have heard many great things about the lead that goes around there nose (not a muzzle) but have yet to get one|`|UwEEHuRcaa	I did not click on the link. I knew someone with a large Husky-type dog who had very good success with a "Halti" head harness. But it doesn't work for everyone, so I'm told. I have never had huge success with choke collars. Training is good. Like many dog owners, you may end up with a pile of unused "aids" in the closet! Good luck.|`|dPVJKn0Zaa	i've used lots of types of harnesses and leashes to stop my dogs from pulling, also took them to obedience classes, tried the stop walking when they are pulling method, but still had a miserable time while walking.  on the advice of a trainer, i got a gentle leader.  it fits over the dog's nose, is not harmful or painful for the dog, (i was told the prong collars and choke collars can cause damage to the dog's throat and neck)  and it was a lifesaver for us.  it works on the principle that the body follows where the head goes.  i was able to walk my big dog with no pulling almost instantly.  i know some will say it is a "crutch" but it worked wonders for us.  it took a few minutes for the dog to get used to it over his nose, but once we started walking, the problems stopped.  i know they sell them at petco and petsmart, and both places will refund your money if you don't feel the item is working for you.  it may not work for everyone, but it worked wonders for me.|`|AA11352641	Thank you for not using a prong collar. That goes right on the list of things like shock collars that cruel dog owners should be subjected to wearing themselves.     I think your dog might still be able to yank you with that kind of leash, but it's worth a try. Some dogs get so excited they ignore the discomfort though and just struggle more. The shelter I volunteer at uses halti and gentle leader, which looks like a muzzle but it's not. The thing about traditional collars and halters is that the neck and shoulders are where dogs exert all their force from when they pull. the gentle leader attaches to the muzzle so if a dog tries to pull, it makes their head turn. BUT if you let a dog sit there with one on, they'll figure out they can pull it off with their paws, so you gotta put it on and keep them moving.     It sounds like your dog needs some obedience and time to mature as well. When you have him inside spend time teaching him sit, shake, no, come, etc so he's an all around more obedient dog.|`|moIPv7pFaa	I've never had any luck with harnesses. From my experience it makes the dog want to pull harder; that's why mushers use harnesses for the sled dogs. The dog feels the pressure on their CHEST, not their NECK, so it makes them want to pull. I'm looking at getting one of these for my wolf mix.  http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...  There's also another one I'd suggest, but I can't remember what it's called. It's like a muzzle collar combo, or a double collar (part goes around the top of the neck, part at the bottom).|`|VZN3rT9Waa	A harness is always a good idea, and personally I find it much better than a muzzle.  You could always try a choke collar. Dogs have very strong necks, so it shouldn't hurt them.  Be sure to reward the dog when he's behaving well, it will reinforce the habit.|`|eapfTYqpaa	It's a safer use to always use a harness on a dog because it helps pull it back when walking and doesn't strain the neck. I have always used this for my puppy when going out for training.|`|FDdUMtqlaa	get one of thoes pronged collars      http://www.schaferkennel.com/M12-17.html...|`|bwAtkp27aa	i have a 115 pound rotti and he is nothing but muscle.  i dont like to use the harnesses because it can damage their chest.  i use a gentle leader.   you can either google it or go to your local petsmart and ask for one.  my rotti does not pull anymore.  after a few minutes of him trying to tug on it he wont do it again.    and no he wont be hurt.  it is harmless but he wont pull again.|`|78BfHGY5aa	Hello :-)    I can feel an awfully long answer coming on, so please bear with me!    The harness, gentle leader, and the crutch you mentioned all work... BUT... my question is: What do you want from your dog? If you simply want to walk wihtout being pulled, all are viable alternatives, but if you want your dog to learn to heel, none will give you the results you're after. There are some small dangers with the gentle leader type variety (the one around the nose) as a sharp, unexpected pull can possibly injure the dogs neck because the point of most pull is too far ahead, at the nose. It would be like pulling on a human's head rather than shoulders, if that makes any sense?    Choke and prong collars (to some extent) will give the result of a loose leash walk, BUT remember, dogs have an instinct to pull, so once the collar is tight and the dog has begun to pull, he will continue to do so not to be naughty but from instinct. If your corrections here are poorly timed, then you either will spend an awfully long time on training, or never achieve your goal. (and if you dont have a good leather leash you will loose and awful lot of skin, too!)    Treats are great, but a dog that gets ecxited and distracted often wont stop a fun behaviour for a treat... which then just frustrates you on the end of the lead.    My advice, then? A trainer when you can afford it, and for now, baby steps. You need to first teach your dog what you want in a low distraction (ie BORING to him) environment, then train him (ie now you introduce corrections for non-compliance) then proof him by slowly adding distractions and continuing to train him. Remember the distractions must distract him ( and may be quite different to what you expect) and have to be introduced slowly, on at a time until you are sure he's got it. A good website for training articles is    www.k9force.net    And dont forget to spend heaps of time playing to reduce the stress caused by training. Email me if you want more in depth info.    ,

AA11292430	Yes...one of my cats does this too!  It's kinda weird but funny too.  Sometimes, he'll get in the tub before me and when I start to run the water, he'll watch it come closer and closer and then he'll finally jump out when the watch hits his paws.  Then he sits at the edge of the bathtub and watches me or the water.  What strange little creatures they are!!|`|i17jkOM4aa	My cat oreo takes showers with me everyday!!  He literally gets in the water and showers too, if I don't let him in he pouts all day until the next time I shower!!|`|F3LBgfvwaa	Yes my cats do. They are curious.

q1qvs1oyaa	It all depends on the size of your dog,Most dogs are trained to kill to fend for themselves,I have a 20 yr old toy Miniature foxie cross, and a american pitt bull terrier and I breed guinea-pigs and both dogs sit at there cages and just stare at them.Only because they are housed.So if your ducks are housed for the moment until the dogs get used of them being around,Maybe they may get along with them or EAT them.Cheers,bye for now.|`|rQlzfHqraa	It's simple. Don't. Dogs are carnivores and ducks are prey no matter what you do or how they react to each other. They may play (dog chase and bite at duck) or ( duck chase and bite at dog). It is risky. My neighbors dog killed a duck after two years in the same pasture. My dog played the games with my rooster for years and never more than that, games and playing.
ssHzAVlwaa	You definetly need to keep it frozen. Just keep it wrapped with an extra piece of shrink wrap. You can put in the frozen block  and the fish will nibble on it. Or you can scoop a little water out of your tank and put the little block inside. let it break apart and then feed it to your fish.
qEp9fxU9aa	Seafood spoils very quickly if it is frozen and defrosted.  Open the frozen food, break a piece off and immediately place it back in the freezer because Baby Brine Shrimp defrosts very quickly.  If you think it has or is going bad smell it and if it smells fishy throw it out.  If it just smells salty like the sea then it is fine though be careful in the future.|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	It's not a very good idea. Frozen foods spoil very quickly after they've been thawed. That's true of fish foods, human foods, dog foods, and every other frozen food.    Better to keep the thawed food in the fridge and use it right away.|`|d8f443bc582285db859040a0c5e47adcaa	not really a good idea,as with most frozen foods they soon go of.A better idea is to buy the blister packs which are in small portions rather than the blocks.                              hope this is of help                               regards
JsBb732Maa	http://www.midwesthomes4pets.com/Informa...   How to crate train.|`|Eug52iQDaa	I feel your pain.  It's currently -32 here and the little ones are on strike.  Put potty pads down and use an Expandable Pen to keep them in when you're at work.  Blankets in half and potty pads in the other half.  Make sure they have food and water.  When you're home, leave the gate open to the Ex Pen so that they can use their potty pads there.  Make sure that when they are loose in the house you are there to watch them.  If you cannot watch them, put them in the pen and close the door.    It's a fact of life that babies and small ones just don't deal well with the cold.  When warmer weather comes, transfer a soiled potty pad outside and show it to them.  Hopefully you'll have better behavior during the warmer months.  Remember to leave one potty pad accessible inside even in the summer - just in case!    Good luck to you!|`|aHn6mbLdaa	Crate training is the best way to housetrain dogs. When you first get up take you little ones out to potty. Then back in the house for playtime of small meal if you are feeding twice a day. Then before leaving for work, one more time out side. When back in the house put them in their seperate crates. When you get home from work they will need to be taken back out ASAP. Then I would sugget taking them out a little after you feed them in the evening and then again before bedtime. Then back in the crates for the night. Once they get older and reliable you will be able to leave them out if you want. Hope that helps.|`|e3bbea72940dc8ddb89cf1c33bdc265aaa	Yes paper training is the way to go by the sounds of it.. 8-430 is a long time for a pup to hold it.. but i guess with the other dogs company and a place to 'go' it should be ok|`|gpJ3RHbyaa	If your dogs have 0% body fat, you really need to take them to the vet.  Be a responsible owner and feed them right.  Sometimes exaggeration can be VERY annoying.      Use puppy pads. Simple as that...|`|VPycXVIlaa	Use the paper method.     You put them in a room and line it completely with newspaper. Eventually they will pick a spot they like. Gradually remove the paper from the rest of the room until you only need one piece in the spot that they've chosen to go. Then you can start moving the paper to where you would like them to go. You can do this during the winter months. By the time you are ready to start moving the paper towards the door/outdoors it'll be warm again.    You can also get special absorbing pee mats.. instead of newspaper. They're made of the same absorbing material as diapers so they soak up the pee really well.    Good luck!|`|zeXMAsF7aa	take them outside they are dogs not babies its been -25 for the last 2 months and my dogs go outside it just don't take them as long to do their buisiness. My dogs are 3 months and 3 years we put the little one in her crate during the day and she does just fine if we don't give her alot of water in the morning and let her out before we leave .|`|8d6BxvGmaa	a puppy pad|`|C1eHfhrHaa	LOL!  You think it's cold in TN, try Vermont!  We are in the process of house training a pup as well and she goes outside just like our adult dogs.  We confine our pup to the kitchen when we are gone because she is not old enogh to crate train yet (we typically do that at 6 months) and expect to clean up the messes.  When we are home she goes out in the yard with our other dogs, but for the first couple of weeks, we leashed her to praise her when she went outside.  It certainly takes a little longer when you are working and you will have plenty of people on here telling you how mean you are to leave your dogs all day while you work, but I have always worked full time when I had dogs (otherwise, how could I afford it?) and they have all turned out fine.  We currently have five dogs and 3 are crated, one older adult has freedom of the house and the pup is in the kitchen.  Once she hits 6 months we will start crate training her and then that usually finishes the house breaking because they don't want to eliminate where they sleep and they are crated for about 8 1/2 hours a day with very few accidents.  They do happen, but usually are a result of an upset stomach.  Good luck!
lhOd2hvXaa	Call your local animal control and they will come get him (and hopefully try to rehome him).    Good Luck!|`|Vp4DcPX2aa	Does it have tags? If so call the owners and tell them you have there dog. if not then you call the animal police, and hey will come pick it up. And keep it until the owner finds it or they will give it away.|`|ERjGLJaEaa	If he is pure bred then you can contact a local canine rescue group in your area or an area around you. They will usually travel a little to pick up a dog. Also you can just simply put an ad in the paper and let the callers know that your neighbor so unkindly left the poor 4 legged friend behind. :( So sad how ignorant people are!|`|gwUMipsUaa	You call Animal Control to come get him, and give them the names of your neighbors so charges can be brought up against them.|`|AA12128656	call animal control. the neighbors need to be held responsible. then you should find a no kill shelter or rescue to get the dog from the pound.|`|HgRYP3cJaa	check around for local no-kill shelters.

About your only option is to either try and contact the previous owner with a warning of having the dog taken OR call the SPCA or a local large dog rescue.  Ideally, the rescue would be my route.  Not all SPCA shelters are no kill shelters so I would lean more toward notifying a local rescue ASAP.  If there anyway you can keep him in your back yard just until he gets picked up? You dont want him running free!    Good Luck :)|`|JBPsePnwaa	Call the local Animal Control, SPCA,whatever is in your area.  This dog has been abandoned.  Most shelters will not euthanize without reason, and will try to find him a home.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Well I would call animal control and tell them that the last owners left the dog behind, maybe they can find out where they moved to.  Other than that, I would take a stray to my vets, she has a talent for finding homes for animals and not having them put down.|`|6TXiBrXOaa	Put a free dog ad in the newspaper.. or a free classified ad..  Like:  www.craigslist.com  or  www.kijiji.com    Good luck|`|pc7ZjexJaa	Do you have friends or family that could take him?  If not...find a NO-KILL shelter and take him there    see if you can contact the owners|`|FewhKlx9aa	Find a no kill shelter in your area and ask if you can bring him there or they can pick him up..I know that with the economy and so many people losing their homes they are leaving behind their pets..I say they never should of gotten one in the first place if this is how they treat them.To be left in an empty house with no food or water is just so cruel,so please do your best to get him to a shelter
GpiRaSvPaa	I wouldn't even really know how to start a list like that because there are countless breeds that are extremely loyal. I have owned a Chocolate Lab, a Black Lab, a Rhodesian Ridgeback/Rottweiler mix, a Fox Hound, a Cocker Spaniel, 2 Mini Schnauzers and 3 American Pit Bull Terriers. All of my dogs were very loyal. However, I do have to say, our APBTs were hands down the most loyal. Not to mention, they were the easiest to train, they were the most people friendly and they were the best with children. BUT, not all dogs are the same. It all depends on how they have been bred, raised, trained, socialized and controlled.     APBTs are wonderful, very loyal dogs. They adore attention, often relishing the company of humans and are notorious for their loyalty to their masters, even giving their lives for them. But, like all breeds, they are not for everyone. I would strongly suggest you do your research on any breed before getting it to make sure it's the right breed for you, and to make sure you get a breed you are willing and able to properly raise, train, socialize and control.|`|SqGsgwlTaa	British bulldogs are very loyal and loving and adore attention and they will follow you to the ends of the earth|`|ERjGLJaEaa	In my experiences my mutts have been the best most loyal dogs.

bDPVRtCNaa	Never. Performing 100% water changes removes all the beneficial bacteria that lives in your substrate and filter media. The bacteria breaks down fish waste.   Stick with your weekly 25% partial water changes.|`|dD08pRIwaa	You shouldn't change the water 100% unless there is a very bad disease because it gets rid of important bacteria. You can scrub everything down when it gets covered in enough algae.|`|z2gMkmRSaa	WOW! You sound like you are doing everything right. I have betta fish (Scarlet) in a small glass bowl, he is a male betta and has plenty of room to swim. I clean Scarlet's tank once every month and that is all it takes! I use a toothbrush (old of course) to clean the sides of the tank. Keep the tank away from the window or direct light. It causes algae. Make sure you are using declorinating drops before putting Wilfred back in his tank! Hope this helps. I change his water completely every time. Scrub everything clean whenever you change the water. :)|`|veMA1a6paa	you shouldnt have to change the water 100% since you have a filter. It might be a good idea to get a small aquarium vacuum and vacuum the rocks out once a month or so. That way you can clean up what the filter cant get. Replace that with bottled water. If you decide to use tap water, make sure you get a chemical at the pet store that takes out the junk that is in tap water.|`|UbSJPBuNaa	never do a 100 % water change just do 25%
Rx7wv4JLaa	Dogs have what is called an estrus cycle (heat cycle)    There are 3 stages to the estrus cycle     proestrus: the dog starts bleeding from the vulva and develops progressive swelling to the uterus.(lasts 5-9 days on average)  Estrus: the bleeding diminishes but the vulva remains swollen (6-12 days on average)  Diestrus: the dog comes out of heat and teh vulva begins to return to normal.    Other then the signs listed during the three stages, some dogs will experience behavioral change, Like whining.     If you dog is coming into heat please supervise her while she is outside or if she is around other dogs. Female dogs have been known to do the crazyiest things to escape and mate. My dog use to starve herself so she could squeeze threw a whole in a fence.     A dog has their first heat cycle at approx 6 months old. But anything between 4-10 months is normal.    I recommend spaying your dog before she has her first heat cycle there are many health benefits to her if you do. Please take the time to read this article on spaying it is very useful.     http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content...|`|3giaPYe8aa	Her vulva will swell.

Bz68Ncmwaa	The 3rd and fourth are tail protectors for when floating/trucking your horse. The first two are weird paddock ones to keep the tail clean I'm guessing. I use one different from all of them in the paddock - it attatches to to horse's rug just above where the tail starts, stuck on with velcro. It's basically a long thin bag that goes right around the tail to the very end, made of some sort of waterproof material.  like this http://www.trademe.co.nz/Sports/Equestri... and it attatches to their rug at the top.
qNVP4Q1Saa	Yes it is. The animal will have restrictions though. i.e. a dog must be 8 weeks old or better. They must be shipped in an approved crate. the crate must have food and water and absorbent material under the pad like a diaper pad etc.  It is traumatic for the animals in some cases and they should be lightly medicated. Involve your vet if you have questions. I used Delta and they seemed to be very in tune with the requirements and so on.  Make sure you name and address are permanently affixed to your crate like with Sharpie so someone cannot steal the cage or mistake the name etc.  Be sure all issues are covered....|`|zKyy1gE2aa	Yes you can, it's not cheap though. I do know a lot of breeders ship their pups from state to state. It's usually another $200 or so.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Yes it is.  They can be shipped on several airlines as cargo.  You'll have to look into their regulations though.  It isn't a free service either.
vMByDy1raa	If there mind is made up, then no.  Maybe they never really know what to expect with a bird.  No Research on the bird and present the fact to your parent.   Ask them to take you to an Exotic bird store just to look and ask the employees there questions, so your parents can hear the answer.  Many people think birds are dirty animals and cause disease.  Some people even afraid of people  Make sure you can show your parents what you are going to do with the bird on vacation.  Also in 4 to 5 years you will be going to college.  Will they have to take care of it then?   They may be afraid birds are messy they are, but not dirty.  Don't go to pet smart or something like that because those birds aren't at their best.  Go to an exotic bird shop in your area.|`|alB67a4xaa	I think you should tell your parents that a bird is a wonderful companion. you have to convince them that you are responsible enough for cleaning their cage. they also need a lot of attention . my parakeets just had 3 newborns. they are very cute.|`|enC9TvxUaa	-your parents house, their rules, sorry!

It sounds like they're pretty set in their decision. Besides, birds live a long time and they probably don't want to get stuck with it when you go to college and can't take it with you (which is likely to happen if you live anywhere that doesn't allow animals.. like the dorms). I would wait until you're living on your own and in a place that will let you have a bird. It's only a few more years.

Do you assume that a reptile is less of a responsibility?|`|44kEtDvIaa	Nothing here will give you practice for taking care of a ferret.

A crested gecko will not need crickets as often because they can eat instant gecko food or fruit babyfood.  The leopard gecko is very easy to take care of, docile, and doesn't need that much space.    Research whatever reptile you choose to provide the best possible habitat and food.    By the way, a ferret will be 100 times more demanding than a reptile.  They need daily interaction and have large space requirements.  I don't think a reptile is really going to prepare you for a ferret.  Try talking to people who own them, or post questions on ferret forums.  Maybe a friend will let you care for theirs for a day so you can try it out.|`|6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	You should not be getting any type of pet to see if you can take care of it. Any animal is a commitment. Any type of reptile that you get is going to take a lot of care as well as any other animal. You really need to sit back and think about the responsibility that is going to be involved and be sure 100% that you are ready for it. I would not recommend any reptile unless you are committed to take care of ALL of their needs and really that goes for any animal. Sorry if this rubs you the wrong way but just how I feel.|`|9a9bc3fcd75b9c1aaf0f67c0fead9c6caa	I think you better give it up. Not much left.|`|krI2fziJaa	Ever hear of Beanie Babies? That sounds right up your alley.   Otherwise iguanas are good but if you want it to be tame you need to put in a lot of handling time.|`|Q6kmIEtaaa	Do NOT get an iguana.  Do NOT.      Moving on....I would try a Uromastyx lizard, they are very calm and easy to care for, and eat veggies.  Also, a small tortoise would be good as well.  But whatever you choose, please, please make sure you do your research, especially if you get a reptile.  They require specific heating/lighting conditions.|`|hDzDiSwxaa	Try a leopard gecko! they like to be handled, the bites don't really hurt, and stays in it's cage most of the time, it needs to be fed live crikets and meal worms with calcium sprinkle, they don't grow too big, they grow to 7-8 inches for a normal kind.|`|QBmtUCoqaa	Leopard gecko definitely! I have one and they are great for someone who doesn't want to constantly handle them. They can be handled as much as you feel, the real problem is not handling them enough.     They won't try to kill you, for they don't have teeth. (Occasionally they will bite, but when your finger is mistaken for food. It doesn't hurt at all!)     The only thing is, they cost a lot at first, Cage, Light, Heating Pad, Reptile Carpet (Don't use sand), etc. But after that they only need food and occasional supplies.     Yes, you will need to feed it live things. But only meal-worms, wax-worms, and crickets. Not all that bad. The crickets aren't old enough to chirp, so it shouldn't bother you.    I strongly recommend a leo, but I disagree with your idea. I believe a reptile should NOT be used as a test pet to see if you are responsable enough for a ferret. If you want a reptile, stick with it. If not, go and buy a ferret!|`|SiPZHrn4aa	1. That is fine.  I don't see any problems with that.  Just make sure you continue to give it proper care and attention or give it to another good owner once you get your ferret.    2. Then avoid tokay geckos, white-lined geckos, veiled and Jackson's chameleons, snapping turtles, and horned frogs.    3. There is no reptile that likes to be handled.  Some reptiles - such as leopard geckos, crested geckos, bearded dragons, corn snakes, ball pythons, and a couple others - will tolerate handling to a certain extent, but 15% of there time is far too much.  I would say up to thirty minutes a day depending on the species of the animal and the specimen itself.    4. Snakes are your best bet for something handleable.  All amphibians (frogs, salamanders, and newts), turtles and tortoises, and some lizards are not handleable.  The best easy-care-for and handleable species are leopard geckos, bearded dragons, ball pythons, and corn snakes.    5. To tell you the truth, things that eat insects are 100x easier to feed than omnivores and herbivores.  Herps (the name for reptiles and amphibians) such as iguanas, uromastyx, agamas, and others need a lot more variety in their diet than pure carnivores or insectivores such as geckos, snakes, and frogs.|`|mPHDZ0Vzaa	I would highly recommend a bearded dragon  My friend has one  he keeps it in its cage almost all of the time,but he can take it out whenever he wants  It does not bite AT ALL  He feeds it lettuce, grapes,crickets, and carrots  hope this helps
C1eHfhrHaa	Unfortunately, your dog will not understand no matter what you do to try to make it better.  I was really nervous about boarding one of our dogs and it turned out to be fine. he had never been boarded- he traveled everywhere with until he was about 2 1/2 and he did great!  The best thing you can do is not be nervous about it.|`|velIdcbNaa	Well what i have found effective is when he over reacts when ever you walk in the door is to ignore him.  When he settles down you pay attention to him.  Practice going in and ot of your door.  Wait outside for 5-10 minuets and calmly walk inside again.  if he is hyper ignore him again until he is calm.  Do this until he no longer over reacts, or doesn't pay attention to your absence.      It sounds like he is scared of kennels.  It is normal, but you need to get him used to being away from you for periods of time.  be sure to increase the time span of you being away each time.  He should get over the discomfort of you being away, but you have to be constant!|`|ltGDrSbXaa	My dog used to tear up my apartment whenever I left him, even just to check the mail.   What I found helps is to first, not slather attention on the dog right when you get back. One of my friends was telling me that by doing that, I was rewarding the freak-out behavior.  Second, you should first try little trips away, like leave for a minute at a time or so, then come back. This didn't work for me, but has worked for other friends.  If nothing else, I've never seen a dog get completely over separation anxiety.|`|LzPhdri5aa	Give him a toy with your scent.  Sleep with the toy over night.
8NSh1D4Maa	It's less the breed than the individual horse.  Choose a breed that is well-suited for the type of riding you want to do, and look for a well-trained, push-button, 'bombproof', older (teens or twenties) horse that is already trained in the discipline you'll be using them in.  Have a vet of your choosing evaluate the horse, including a comprehensive lameness exam, before you buy.  If you are new to riding, also have a trainer or experienced horse-person ride the horse and give you their assessment of their suitability for your skill level.|`|t6UkxbBNaa	Thoroughbreds are extremely hyper, and Arabians are snooty. I would suggest a Quarter Horse because the Therapeutic Riding Association uses them, because they are soooo docile, and sweet! I own a QH and I adore him! Paint Horses are very calm too. But it does depend on how the horse has been handled and it's attitude. NEVER BUY A YOUNGSTER AS A FIRST-TIMER HORSE!!! It's been the biggest mistake ever in the horse industry, it my sound sweet to buy a young one for your child but it is terrifying! I suggest you buy a horse 10 yeas old and up. Trust me it's alot better for both you AND your horse.|`|dbMv10CIaa	i would get a quarter horse. quarter horses are very sweet and calm. they learn stuff realy fast. we used to have a quarter horse that was only 4 and she was smarter then my horse that has been trained since she was a baby! when you look for horses and find the one you like ask them if they will let you ride  it so you can see if you like it or not. make sure you don't get a hyper ( warmbloods, sometimes thouroghbreds, arabians,etc.). when you do find one you like look up its breed online and see if their breed is realy hyper.
OyNJTWaiaa	Check the babies crop to see if it has food in it before you do anything like removing it from the nestbox. Parent raised is best and if the sound of the chick is all that worrying you, then that isn't the only sign that they are not are not looking after it. Look for the bubble at its neck...the crop....if you see food in it, it is being fed and leave it be. If no food in the crop then yes its a sign they aren't feeding it and you need to do something.   Babies crop photo  http://i273.photobucket.com/albums/jj233...  If the babies crop is empty....you need to get some hand rearing formula from the petshop and a syringe and follow directions on the packet. Also have a warm place to keep the baby.

a29qiNkvaa	I was shocked at what all, my dog is allergic too! Here is a few grass, ragweed, junipers, Dandelions, cottonwood trees and tons more! She is on allergy shots the first test was about $180 and then the bottle that should last a year or longer will cost $150!     What food do you have you dog on? Have you though about making sure there is no chicken! That was one of the major things for my female! My male cant have any grains! SO I have them both on solid gold barking at the moon.     I also thought it was beef because the fist vet told use that could be and it was not the beef it was the chicken and chicken fat in all the foods! Just a thought!      My test was just a simple blood draw testing! They sent to a lab and they did everything! I was also told the food test was a joke!      another thought have you had her thyroid test? i just had my female test and she was really low and she now on meds that have helped!|`|qS2ugtlNaa	20$|`|p3vjvzRPaa	I don't think the allergy tests are helpful and they are expensive.    Did you do the food trial properly?  It isn't just a matter of changing brand.  You need to change to completely bland food, then start introducing one new ingredient at a time, and you have to do each for several weeks.    This is a good website:  http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?...    You can also think about the environment she is in, the allergy may not be to food.  I know of dogs that were allergic to the sticks they chewed on, the shampoo used to wash them, the lawn they lay on, the washing powder used on the blankets they slept on, the material in their collar, the air freshener used in the home.  Again try changing things one at a time.    Good luck!|`|KxjUim7yaa	Made sure the pet has not had benedryl or prednisone for the allergy. It will affect the testing.|`|AA11244754	This is something you don't need to be asking on here, call your vet and get a quote from them|`|3c49a0964bbe36e70dcf40e56a9d58d6aa	Allergy testing for a dog is typically pricey anywhere between $100-$300.  It usually involves taking several blood samples.  Although it may be somewhat expensive, you'll get the most conclusive results as to what your dog is allergic to.|`|pvgwJwxvaa	usually around 175- 200.    food allergy testing is worthless, but environmental allergy testing is good.|`|3IApfZopaa	Depends what you are testing for each test is charged seperate so figure about $200 each|`|yjNoIzGBaa	i completely disagree  you can control the food you feed   you more than likely can't change the environmental allergen you live around unless you want to move   and as far as the testing it is the same   vets usually can tell whether it is an environmental or food allergy just by the signs but they usually recommend doing both  both tests are usually around 150-250 dollars   Its a simple blood test that you send out   it is good to know what your pet is allergic to either way   but honestly the shots efficacy is still being questioned  and i dont think that i would ever do this to any pet i owned   i would do both allergy tests if my dog had allergies       god get her off the benadryl ASAP  if anything get her on chloraphanaramine  an over the counter antihistamine   but you really need to get her on atopica which is perscription but spendy :(    no no no no no   ok so they will draw blood from a leg vein  they will send it out to the lab  it takes a while for results i want to say at least 4 weeks which is long in veterinary medicine but rather common in human  they will get a report   it will tell you everything they tested for and there will be elevations on the ones that she is allergic to  then from that you either eliminate potential allergens  but a lot of them you cant like grass unless you dig it up and pour concrete but then what if she gets out and walks through grass  so if it a lot of allergens or ones that you cant eliminate like chicken etc.  are present then you can do the allergy shots  with this you are given 3 vials they all include all the allergens that your dog has   then you give as directed which is usually once daily and then using all the vials you wean down   you dont shave you just give it like a vaccine  most often owners report no resolution but improvement  there are also special prescription diets you can get   really you need to seek a dermatologist or at least another   benadryl should not have been prescribed for this type of allergy reaction   if anything they could have prescribed temeril P instead

I would suggest a water bottle, but if your cat has long hair, or likes water (like mine) then don't use water as a punishment. Also don't use water if bathing your cat is rough in the first place.<br>  <br>  First of all, do not feed your cat any food except his own. He can not distinguish between a treat from you in the kitchen or a friend handing food of their plate while they are carrying into a new room. It will only confuse him and make him want your food even more.<br>  <br>  I also suggest to not let your cat on any surface that you may eat off of. This has to be your territory. So for example, my kitchen counters, kitchen table, and coffee table in my living room are off limits. <br>  <br>  Also try feeding your cat after you eat, and get into the habit of it. This marks you as the dominant one (You eat your take in the meal, and only after you are done, can your cat eat).<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|yxJKgf9Faa	hiii <br>  OMG i have this problem too its so irritating dinner time is a constant battle with 2 cats trying to swipe off my plate ive tryed spraying them but it doesent work! they hang around until ive finished and if i get up to go toilet and leave my tea on the table i come back and their heads are in the cup! i really dont know what to do i lock them out when i eat but then ive caught them licking plates in the sink...i mean seriously they are so well fed but they act as if they havent eaten in years!<br>  i dont know why they are acting like this!|`|T5znNRjraa	My cats do that when theres chicken, turkey, pork, tuna or some sort of meat on it, and sometimes when i leave my plate on the table but it still has some spud on it, they lick that aswell, lool, it depends if you are putting meat on your plate otherwise im not sure why they are doing it.

Did the horse hold his tail higher? And did he have a "dished in" or a dip in his face? If so, it's probably an Arabian or Arabian cross.<br>  <br>  If not... was the horse muscular?

He belonged to a lady who was in a accident and was now a paraplegic.   She gave his to them with the agreement that he would be trained for her to mount and ride him when she got him back.   The only time they used a stand in stunt horse was for the scenes where the horse was required to swim... Cas O Leigh had a white Blaze and I think a white sock that they blacked out for the movie.

The live virus can bring about a mild case of the disease being vaccinated against, while the killed virus can't.  But the killed virus is more likely to produce an adverse response to the vaccine.

Edit:  If the cat has a collar, someone obviously bought it and put it on.  Someone's been caring for this cat.  You should check the papers and look for "lost cat" postings.  Meanwhile, make posters of your own trying to find the owner.  The fact that the cat has a collar makes this a bit different.|`|htSZsds7aa	Yes, if you have checked with the lost pets ad in the newspaper, and check with shelters to see if they know anyone missing a cat. once u know for sure its a lost kitty, yeah keep him.

The best thing to do would be to put up posters and ask around if you don't want any possible trouble later.  I took in a cat that had been all over the neighbourhood and was always left out in the rain from people who I knew treated their animals like crap. After we had the cat for about three weeks they came over and tried to take her. Called the cops and the cop said legally it was their cat and I was in the wrong.  Luckily they ended up giving the cat back to me the next day.|`|qmXFCVMIaa	yes , no chip and Ok by landlord , then yes it's yours but like the Yeti said get all the right shots and nuder or spay... now if it was a stray for long it may not be a lap cat straight off so you might haft to take it easy until he/she gets used to you and the new environment|`|9Zjk9dRqaa	yea it's all yours if theirs no one claiming it so all yours for free|`|FKzZTtw2aa	i took in a cat i thought was stray, his owners lived nearby and came over but said they couldnt afford to feed him anymore so they let me keep him, but they were glad to know he was being taken care of, so i agree with the others, you should first post a flier on telephone poles and make sure if he's a stray before you spend a lot of money. i dont think a microchip is a big deal, really. he needs to be neutered for sure, but put a collar and i.d. tag on him so if someone sees him outside, they'll know he has a home. not everyone checks for chips.|`|IzRk1mZQaa	According to the Humane Society in our area, if you have been feeding the cat for at least two weeks, hes yours.  Have there been lost cat flyers around?  Did you check the classifieds?  If he has no microchip, sounds like you got a cat!!|`|c04049b80f1a87bfc8ca501e3dac485daa	Some people feel it's unfair to keep a cat living strictly indoors.    This does not make them ''irresponsible'', though. (The lack of an ID tag, on the other hand...)    Plus, you have to take into consideration that this may not be a free-roaming cat, but rather a LOST cat. Even indoor-only cats can slip outdoors and remain missing for a few weeks. Check to make sure there are no "Lost cat" flyers that match his description (and if there is, do the right thing and contact them!)    I think you still have to post "Found cat" flyers, because if you have a feeling this cat MAY be owned...without an attempt to return the cat to the owner...you might as well be stealing their pet.|`|7w30Zn2raa	Of course, but I'd first check with all your neighbors and make sure he's not someone else's first. Cats will tend to go wherever they are fed, so it may very well not be a feral cat. Other than that, treat him well|`|EPo7N1xBaa	Sure, keep him as long as he is a stray and no one elses. That's good of you to take in and care for a stray kitty. Good luck.|`|n7bok7NRaa	You'll have to check the laws in your area. Some states or cites may have laws that allow an owner to take back a pet given they can reasonably identify it. Plus just because you were feeding it doesn't mean it's yours. It may be someone's outdoor cat.    Find out how long a cat must be "stray" for it to be considered abandoned to start, just in case some angry owners show up on your doorstep with demands.    Just because it doesn't have a collar doesn't mean that someone doesn't love and care for it.|`|af42f925d28ffec0c10e36b8d1d58efcaa	HECK YES!  LUCKY!|`|GjdNo6ksaa	Check  with the local shelter to make sure nobody has reported him as missing, then spay or neuter since he will be much happier and healthier. Last but not least give him lots of love and make sure he can be with you forever. SO much love from the pets  and so little to pay a deposit or something to keep them with you forever.   (indoors) outside they just don't have a good chance on survival.|`|VPycXVIlaa	Yes. Though you should make sure to call your local animal shelter and make sure no one is reporting him missing. It would also be nice of you to put out 'found cat' fliers in your area in case he belongs to someone.|`|2ieiGIhTaa	I think so.  Probably should get him some shots when you take him in to get scanned though.|`|RarSAK4Haa	i would keep him. just make sure you keep him as an inside cat. they live longer.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Yes you can. Shots are very important, call around a few pet shops and find when a clinic will be. The risk of disease is very great, especially in cats who have been out warndering. The Bob Barker foundation helps with referals to low cost spay clinics, or watch for specials in your area, the planet needs no more kittens. Your tops in my book for rescuing that is awesome! Most landlords though, at least in the US require at least 200.00 deposits and some areas also put them on the lease and charge monthly for rent, sorry for the bad news but it just seemed you might be unaware of all the factors in getting a cat. If you are not able to keep the pet, due to fees etc. Craigslist is a great way to find someone to adopt the cat for you. Boy cats can spray furniture and it stinks and does not wash out. If its a boy get it spayed right away.|`|V4D6ocfzaa	Search for an owner and put up signs. In a couple weeks if no one responds you can legally keep the cat.|`|4TX26viFaa	He might have been dumped by an owner as well. If he's that food intense, he's not been eating regularly. So yes, if nobody is looking for him he's yours.
3p6wp7DYaa	She is still very young, so I imagine she is still learning the finer points of housebreaking, right? She may not know that the snow-covered deck is her bathroom spot because it looks and it smells different. Even after you sweep away the snow, it still feels different to her because it is cold and snowy.    You have to keep trying until she really needs to go. Take her out every hour and stand there with her. It could be beneficial to teach her to go out in the yard too, but it is up to you. Take her out and stand there with her. Telling her to do her business will not help until she learns to do it on command, so it is worthless. Just wait calmly. Be boring and just let her explore her new environment. If she does not poop within 20 minutes, take her back inside and crate her for 30 minutes. After that time, take her out again and wait for her to do it. Repeat until she does. I mean, she will eventually need to go. The key is to prevent her  from going in the house, which she will unless you crate her or watch her every move. If you catch her in the act of squatting or sniffing, interrupt her and take her out to her spot immediately, where she will finish her business.|`|VPycXVIlaa	Just keep trying. You are outside with her when you put her out there to go right? You shouldn't leave a small dog like that in the cold for very long at all.    After she goes give her lots of love and rewarding. She'll get the clue eventually.|`|JsBb732Maa	Are you telling her to go potty? That sounds silly but my dogs know the command for potty and it helps when you need them to just go. If you can walk her, it will stimulate her needing to go.|`|qS2ugtlNaa	i want that dog but every time he has to go bring him to the same spot a say go popo and easly after time give him freedom|`|htSZsds7aa	why isnt she allowed access to the lawn? she needs to smell nature not your deck. Take her for a walk and she will probably go.|`|66jX06Onaa	It's cold outside! Sometimes smaller dogs are too cold to go.   I always found that taking them for a walk helps. She can stay out as long as you can.    Just imagine if you had to go out and use an outside - it's not pleasant to have to do your business outside in the cold.     Another remedy my sister-in-law uses - make a covered pen area outside and put small gravel inside. It's worked well for her small breed dogs.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Try taking it for a walk.|`|BhgA7oCGaa	maybe she doesn't have to go.....i have a mini schnauzer and she only poos twice a day because i feed her twice a day and she pees a few times because i giver her water...try crate training it is very effective trust me.....leave her in there with toys and treats and when u let her out she will have to and and most likely will if you get the right sized crate..it is instinctive for dogs not to poo or pee where they sleep! you ever heard the saying...Don't **** where you sleep at?...same thing|`|b5ecvoTnaa	well, try to get rid of the snow, obviously. Including on the railings, since it seems that's the problem. hope this helps!|`|2fRYEAn8aa	buy one of those potty mats that looks like grass(i think)   i heard those work really well. but as soon as winter is over move your dog back to doing her business outside, you don't want it to become a habit for her.|`|xJEEX63Maa	We have a dog...... When we were potty training him we would do what you did and make him go out there and got him a doggie door....... When he went in the house we would spank him 2 times... not hard tho....|`|C1eHfhrHaa	Walk her on a leash instead- the exercise will stimulate her need to eliminate.|`|YSVMFcM7aa	Well maybe she doesn't like the deck and gets too distracted with the pretty white snow. You can go to any local store with dog pads in it. They have a smell so your dog should do her business. Inside though.|`|hRikwc00aa	Here are some tips that should help you!    1. You need to go out with her, at least until she's reliably housetrained. Have her on a leash so she doesn't get too distracted.    2. Have a set schedule. Take her out first thing in the morning, right before you go to bed at night, and every four-five hours in between. Feed her at the same times too; feed her twice a day, give her fifteen minutes, then take away whatever she doesn't eat.    3. A crate would be the best investment you could make for housetraining your dog. A crate-trained dog sees the crate as a den, and will not eliminate in it. Put her in her crate at night, when no one's home, and when you can't watch her so she won't have an accident. The crate should be just big enough for her to stand up, turn around, and lay down in. If it's bigger, she may be able to potty in one end and sleep in the other.    4. When you take her out, go directly to the potty-place (her pen). Stand in one place, and let her circle around you. Only give her five minutes; she needs to learn this is something she has to do quickly. If she goes, praise her bigtime and give her a yummy treat, like cheese or meat. Then reward her with at least a short walk. If you take her in right after she goes, she'll connect pottying with going inside, which is no fun! Besides, she needs her exercise.    5. If she doesn't go, take her back in and put her immediately in her crate, so she doesn't have an accident inside. Try again in twenty minutes and every twenty minutes after until she goes.    6. If she does have accident, don't scold or punish her. It's not her fault - you should have been watching her more closely!    Good luck!
y7igESfUaa	Check out the different vets in your area. You can always call them and ask how much the surgery will be; each vet charges a different price. Good luck to you.|`|Vp4DcPX2aa	I would call the vets in your AREA. or if your cat has a regular vet it goes to ask them. If you do not have a regular vet call around and get prices.

D8KgIX8naa	Yes, too many fish|`|AA11708471	Thats terrible    Does nobody do research before they buy living things anymore    9 fancy goldfish need 100 gallons minimum  9 comet/common goldfish need 210 gallons minimum    What do you mean cleaner?

They dont clean your tank they still produce masses of ammonia and most grow about 2 feet long|`|bDPVRtCNaa	It depends on the type of fish.    ~EDIT~ You have 9 GOLDFISH in a 20 gallon tank. Do you realize how overstocked that is? Unless you have the money to invest in at least a 100 gallon aquarium, return those fish.|`|PqT6pQAoaa	um it depends on the size of the fish? what kind are they?    EDIT: ARE U CRAZY! 9 GOLDFISH IN A 20 GALLON!? DO U KNOW THAT ONE GOLDFISH REQUIRES 20 GALLONS TO THEMSELF. I WOULD RECOMMEND RETURNING THE GOLDFISH AND GET SMALL COMMUNITY FISH SUCH AS DANIOS, PLATIES, GUPPIES, TETRAS, CORIES, ETC.|`|N2O9LUwaaa	It depends on the length and species of the fish. I think they recommend like 1/2 inch per gallon. The type of fish makes a difference as well. If you have like Oscars (I think this is what they are called) or something, you don't want as many. In general though, I would say yes, too many.|`|MvisyrRVaa	The hand of rule for fish in a tank is 1 fish per 1 gallon of water (assumeing they are normal gold fish or smaller)|`|dD08pRIwaa	There are to many fish. One goldfish requires atleast 20 gallons alone.|`|AA11841265	yea, deff 2 many.|`|ztj88BgZaa	might want to take some fishes out dum ***|`|AwJXIFDraa	Depends on the size of the fish.

Wait how big are these fish?|`|2G0a5zUSaa	this depends on the size of the fish and the type of fish.  If they are very small your tank is fine.  A good general rule is one gallon (minimum) per fish.|`|8bef1b50aa3d5b7e84321e722510a842aa	The basic rule is 0.5 inches of fish for every 1 gallon    So if you have 20 gallons, then no more than 10 inches of fish.    I know that sounds weird "10 inches of fish" but imagine if you lined them all up end to end.  Would you have more than 10 inches long in fish body?|`|QV6swGUMaa	Yes ya have to many so ya do 1 gold fish should have 100 litres of water by right.60 at the very least.sorry to be the barer of bad news.tropical fish like tetras or guppies would be fine in a tank like that.
bDPVRtCNaa	Nine goldfish and an algae eater in a twenty gallon tank is severely overstocked.     ~Nine fancy goldfish should have a minimum of 100 gallons. They are massive waste producers and grow large. In tanks that are not appropriately sized they will suffer from ammonia poisoning, stunted growth and a shortened lifespan.     ~Algae eaters are tropical fish and should not be housed with cold water goldfish.     A single fancy goldfish requires twenty gallons to himself, and ten gallons must be added for every fancy goldfish after the first. You could house a single fancy goldfish and that is it.    ~EDIT~ The black moor should grow 6-8 inches. Why couldn't you have researched before buying them? Now you have goldfish that are not being taken care of correctly.|`|AA11708471	assuming they are the same fish as your last question i will give the same answer    Thats terrible    Does nobody do research before they buy living things anymore    9 fancy goldfish need 100 gallons minimum  9 comet/common goldfish need 210 gallons minimum    What do you mean cleaner? I assume its a plecostomus    These are tropical fish. They dont clean your tank they still produce masses of ammonia and most grow about 2 feet long|`|tMoiOyJUaa	the rule is 1 inch of fish = 1 gallon of water|`|AA12246425	the rule of thumb is an inch per gallon so if you have a 20 gallon tank,you should have no more than 20 inches of fish (its based on their size)|`|OAzJPUkHaa	According to your last question all of them are goldfish(one being a black moor).  I'm hoping your "cleaner" is something small like an oto or cory cat(which should be in schools).  Your tank is very over crowded, your tank should only hold one fancy and nothing else.  Give your eight of your fish(seven goldfish and the "cleaner"), make sure your filter is strong enough for a messy fish, and keep up with your water conditions.   The one inch per gallon rule is crap. A 10 inch fish cannot live in a 10 gallon tank.    Sounds like a bristlenose, still say return your fish.  They seem happy now, but they ain't gonna be too happy when they start dying prematurely(goldfish can live for 20 years).|`|jzTr87Ftaa	Yes, I would echo many of the other answers here.  You are very overstocked, and should consider finding new homes for a lot of your fish.  When fish are living in crowded areas, they begin to get "stunted" which is very unhealthy, painful, and lethal to fish.
w4DIPHf1aa	forget neons..get 4-5 cardinals..    there far more timid and guaranteed to school just like the rummies, in fact theres a good chance the rummies and the cards may school together.    they are a bit of a fragile fish  just like the rummies but a far better pick fish wise as there colouring is far superior to neons.      just make sure you don't add all these fish at once and know ahead of time how a tank cycles, so none of your fish die.    I would go 4-5 rummies then 2 weeks 4-5 cards then 1 week add your cichlid.    If you add the cichlid first he may think the tanks is all his and any new fish you add he may get mad at...    just a possibility    its going to be risky..those cichlids like really peaceful tanks unbusy tank and getting 2 is far better than getting one, there not a fish that like to be alone at all. They are also very fragile and rarely live past a year. Nice fish though. And remember the better the colouring in the store the meaner he is. Traits of dominant fish.    So i know it sounds crazy but don't pick the 2 nicest ones for a tank that small. research the fish abit more..      you'll be good to go.    I'd go 2 rams 4 cards 4 rummies and even thats overstocked, maybe the rams and chose between 5-6 rummies or 5-6 cardinals.      good luck|`|bIh5ZFwIaa	5 is good, but they arnt very hardy so make sure you cycle the tank 1st    they also like to be in odd numbers for some strange reason so 5 or 7 is goood    email me if you need anything else, i own a shop  and breed endlers :)|`|ur5wDhkMaa	6 is technically the bare minimum, when they say 10 is best, take into account they are swimming as a shoal and 10 looks better than 6.    If you go with 5 and who is to argue between 5 or 6, it's no significant increase to the bio load, will the visual impact be worth giving them the room. You could add more to other species and just forget about them.    If you want tetra to shoal as a mixture, they have to be roughly the same size and temperament.|`|h4wNRqf9aa	6-7 is a good minimum for schooling behavior    but the best appearance i think is around 15-20 ;)|`|21ETrW6kaa	they say that 6 is the best minimum but it is usually the case that you will see a deal for five at most aquarist shops.   i started with five neon but i have added another five as they do compliment each other in a larger shoal, however as one of your other answerer`s has said tetra`s will usually shoal together anyway.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	5 or 6 since they are schooling|`|qEp9fxU9aa	They are schooling fish and I recommend a minimum school of 7.  With that said I've seen other tetras school with neons so a variety may work though this varies.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	Five is fine.  They really only need one or two other companions and other tetras will do fine to comfort them.  I had them in a group of three once (started with more, but some died and I didn't want to replace them because I was trying to cut down on the fishtanks I had).|`|rHwMf2P4aa	Yes neon tetra do thrive better in bigger groups but 3 fish is the minimum for a school of them. So 5 would be fine. As long as you are at 3 or more. The other tetra you are getting would be fine with them also. Smaller fish together is good. The only thing I have to really put out there is that the butterfly cichlid is or is going to be very aggressive. In the end will become very territorial and start to take over the tank. They eat smaller fish or kill them by picking on them constantly. I would really suggest taking him out of there and sticking with tropical community.|`|2ZUDlLCjaa	6 is the reccomended amount but who cares about 1 i have some

RjlBrP98aa	I'm assuming you want something like a cat or a dog, like a small furry animal. My suggestions would be a rabbit or pair of rabbits, a guinea pig or pair of guinea pigs, or rat(s)/hamster(s)/gerbil(s).<br>  <br>  Rabbits are probably the most like a dog or cat on that list. They can be very small or very big, they are very smart, they can be caged or left out, they can be litterbox trained, they are quiet, and they are all around cute and fun and some are very cuddly. If you're interested in a rabbit, I suggest researching them a bit at www.rabbit.org. You can also find a local rescue shelter near you to adopt from, which I highly recommend.<br>  <br>  Guinea pigs are similar to rabbits in some ways, but definitely very different too. They are smaller than most rabbits, they can't be fully litterbox trained, they are not as smart as rabbits, they chatter and make noises which can be very cute, they love to cuddle, and they must be caged. You can also adopt one or more at sites like www.petfinder.com.<br>  <br>  Fancy rats would be probably the other best option in my opinion because they are smart, gentle, and love companionship. Hamsters would be nice but they are nocturnal and will be making noise at night, plus they may have a tendancy to bite. Gerbils also might be nice, but I know they try very hard to escape into hard to reach places.<br>  <br>  For all of these pets, you should make sure you get the right size cage for them (which stores often will sell cages too small for the animal) or build one yourself like an NIC Condo which can be quite fun. You also need to consider diet, social time needed, life expectancy, and space needed. Definitely do a little research to find which one is best for your current living situation.<br>  <br>  They all require daily maintenance like a dog or cat, as they need fresh water and food. Rabbits need their litterbox cleaned out at least once a week and groomed with a brush at least once a week as well. Guinea pigs and the other rodents need the litter in their cage changed at least once a week. <br>  <br>  Good luck with your choice! :)|`|boyFmgfeaa	a very low maintenance animal would have to be a fish or a hermit crab!<br>  You only have to change fish water about every 2 weeks and a hermit will clean up after its self. GET THE HERMIT CRAB THEY ARE SO COOL!!!!!|`|rQlzfHqraa	Go visit a farm and ask to help care for the animals. You get to interact with animals and the farmer gets some appreciated help. What? you still sitting there? Get to it.|`|jyGTlpzTaa	I would suggest a pair of rats...cute, clean, funny, clever and smart. They can learn tricks, come to their names, and really recognise you in a way other small animals wont.<br>  <br>  Having said this, a lot of people are grossed out by rats so your landlord might not be keen.<br>  <br>  You could also consider a pair of quieter small parrots like budgies. Doves, although not parrots, also make great, friendly pets, but get a pair!<br>  <br>  All of these will require an hour spent with them every day, but they are low maintenance in terms of day to day care.|`|f96ecf10164e7f3a9da36cca8ac9ce14aa	I would disagree with the above poster who said rabbits are low maintenance. I have two, and spend about an hour once a week cleaning their large pen, about 15 minutes every other day or so cleaning litter boxes, and about 2 hours just spending time with them. Rabbits are incredibly social animals, if you don't spend enough time with them, they won't be social, and they won't want you around, which I'm gonna guess is not the type of pet you'd want. Even when I had just one, I spent about half an hour on the pen, about 5 minutes on the litter box, and I'm not even gonna try to come up with the total number of hours I spent with it just so it wouldn't get bored being by itself. Plus, rabbits can be destructive, in a rented place, that's not good. Also, their dietary needs are specific. If their diet is messed up, it can kill the rabbit. Rabbits are best in pairs, which lowers the time you have to spend with them, but you still need to spend time with them. Overall, I would say they are not low maintenance pets. One last thing in my rabbit rant: their vet bills can be outrageous. In the 2 years I had one buck, I sepnt about $600 trying to keep him healthy before I decided the stress I was putting him through was too much, and humanely put him down. This money was spent in about 9 weeks.<br>  Rats would be your best bet, but I'm not going to rant in their favor.<br>  Any pet you get, though, make sure you know what your getting into so that you don't add another pet to a shelter.|`|w9aR8ymGaa	fish would be the easiest but depending on your area (some places they are illegal) you may be able to have a turtle aquarium.  I find turtles to be so exciting and pleasant to watch as they swim.  If you are in the USA, please check out www.petfinder.com<br>  <br>  I agree with the woman above about rats.  Although it freaks some people out, rats have personalities like dogs and can be trained as well.|`|buRYD6Qcaa	sucks that u cant have cats, most low maintenance furry things out there. you can always get a fish. feed it once or twice a day and thats it. or a bearded dragon or another type of lizard, feed it once every couple days.|`|OCMSTxYfaa	fish...the bigger the tank, the easier it is to keep clean.

What I would say to do is to get a fan and blow it at the tank, as weird as it sounds it works. It will slowly cool down the tank to the degree you need them at and it will be at a pace they can acclimate to slowly. I would go buy a new heater asap and maybe call the company or complain to the store you bought it from because of what happened with it. I hope this helps.|`|R7vwxGMmaa	If I were you I would call your local vet or pet store you got the fish from.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Im so sorry, just wait and see. I had a thermometer break, I didnt know that my fish were dancing eradically in the tank as they were being electrocuted.|`|7BVyV4Fdaa	He might, he might not. Salt water tanks are so much harder to take care of. Especially if they are small, you have to change the water VERY often. A 40 gallon tank needs to be changed every two weeks.... so if yours is smaller than that, you will need to change it a lot more frequently than you are.|`|f71bc553ce48de0d47d00ce15fd871aaaa	stop with drastic corrections,     relax and take a deep,     dropping or raising the temp to quick is a bigger problem than having the temp off, just raise the ambient temp of the room, if you can get the room to 70 - 75 degrees plus your lights it should bring the tank into a safe range until you get a new tank heater, also try and point a power head or two up towards the water surface, not shooting out of the tank just enough to give it a good churn at the surface, this will promote evaporationthe by product being a cooling effect     now lets get back to the other issues, 1 month is a tad too new for most stars aside from brittle and serpent stars, these creatures mostly eat algae, detritus and slime so unless you can hand feed it some meat your tank needs a few months to build up these food sources, that as well as water quality that needs a few months to stabilize    hang in there,
Ee2fwrqoaa	Please spay your dog.  If you have to ask such questions on Yahoo Answers, you shouldn't be thinking about bringing more unwanted dogs into this world.  Millions are euthanized each year because of backyard breeders.   You do know that with each heat your dog's chances of cancers increases.    Why don't you ask your breed mentor your questions?  Of course you dog will have her breed championship before breeding?  You do know that you'll need to have all of your health and genetic testing done beforehand?  You need to have a minimum of $2000.00 should your dog have complications during her pregnancy or during whelping, for an emergency c-section.  You'll need a legal contract stating that you'll take back a pup at any time and for any reason, should an owner need to surrender one.  You do know that you could possibly lose your dog due to pregnancy or whelping problems.  You do know that you'll need an ultrasound done, at least once, to see how many pups to expect.  You do know that with every heat your dog's chances of cancers increases.    PLEASE BE RESPONSIBLE AND SPAY YOUR DOG.|`|AA11352641	Please do not breed your dog because you are not knowledgeable on the subject.|`|koVk3P9Gaa	I'll at least be nice to you.

It's her baby.
NnYB9eXiaa	Hi :)    First - NEVER EVER put a hamster in water, no matter how warm or shallow, they're far too prone to illness and just can't handle it.    You'll want to use chinchilla bath sand - the dust can get into their lungs and hurt them.    Get a big bowl, put it on top of some newspaper or a towel as they'll roll flip and dig in it and it will scatter.    They will pee in it, but it clumps like cat litter so you can scoop that out (along with any lil poos) and when the hamster is done, you can put it into a container and usually use it 2-3 times total.    It's possible that your hamster just sat in its own pee, they do that sometimes and the sand will help them get that off.    If s/he keeps being smelly, try spot cleaning its pee corner daily - that will help keep the hamster smelling better.    They're actually quite clean animals and spend a lot of time grooming.    But again, please, never put your hamster in water!    Best wishes - and if you need any additional help or info feel free to send me a msg, I'm always glad to help :)    Daisy    Btw - I don't mind a thumbs down from someone who doesn't like what I say - proper, safe advice that saves an animal is more important than someone's opinion :)|`|YpEswTQdaa	A Sand-bath won't stop him smelling. However it will Buff/shine his coat.    Only provide it for a couple hours,since they tend to urinate in the sand.  Use a damp cloth,to wipe his coat. Or give him a bath in a couple inches of warm(NOT Cold or Hot~Lukewarm) & use a gentle human shampoo,or small animal.    Hope this helps,xxx|`|ZH4N6Xdtaa	Hamsters generally dont smell it is normally their cage or bedding.. does he tend to sleep in his toilet area, if so I would clean that part of his cage out morning and night.
AA11187707	So does Hotwheel think that people that work shouldn't have dogs?? Geez!     I have two dogs and we went through the same thing. I left them in their own crates during the day and just washed the blankets everynight. Dogs actually really like their crates, it's a safe place for them, so you shouldn't worry about leaving him in there all day. It probably is easier to clean his messes though if he is in the kitchen! Also, if you leave him in his crate he may be less inclined to poo or pee in there, where as if he has all the room in the kitchen he will pee and poo for sure.     At his age, he just can't hold it, so you'll have to expect accidents. As he gets older, he will get better. I noticed with our dogs, they learned our schedule and now they don't eat anything in morning.     Goodluck!!|`|NDhC2PNGaa	thats to long for his age older dogs maybe, but your dog can not hold on, and its not fair if you come home and your dog has messed you then tell him/her off, its not fair, think about getting a dog when you have time for one.. its a bit late now.|`|hxBwRt09aa	Do you have a doggy daycare in your town? Can someone come in and give him a walk during the day? He is physically unable to "hold it" for that long. I wouldn't expect an adult dog to hold it for 8 hours during the day after having held it for 8 hours during the night. Confining him to a crate all day will only desensitize him to soiling his bed.   What bothers me more than the potty issue is the boredom this dog will feel five days a week. What do you expect him to do while you're gone? If he has any brains he'll begin rearranging your cupboards. Please find an ongoing source of socialization for him such as a daycare, an active dog park, puppy classes with off-leash socialization.|`|OheUwdxWaa	You should start training him with his crate. Just lock him up right before you leave, and let him out as soon as you get home. After a while, he can left alone in your house with no problem. It's a good idea to start now while he is young, I've made the mistake of waiting before!|`|lhOd2hvXaa	At this age you can't expect him to "hold it" for 8 hours.      There are several options when a you have a pup this age:  --Hire a dog walker to come in while you are at work (at this age it would need to be twice a day to be fair).  --Try litter training, we have used second nature dog litter with great success.  --Put down lots of newspapers and buy a good mop.    Good Luck!|`|AA12128656	you're right. at 3 months, he needs to go. he should not be asked to hold it all day for a few more months.  can you crate him in the morning and have someone let him out halfway through the day? 3-4 hours in the crate would be ok for him, then they could take him out to potty and he could stay in the kitchen for the other few hours.... this would teach him to hold it, and give him the opportunity to eliminate outside, reinforcing his housebreaking.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	No, you cannot leave a three-month old puppy alone that long, and no a three-month-old puppy is not potty trained.  It is only 1 hour for each month of age, plus one hour, so your three-month-old puppy can only be alone/hold its potty for 4 hours at the most.  Come home during lunch, get a dog walker, pet sitter, family help, someone from church.  The bladder isn't grown until 6-months-old, so you can't possibly expect this sacred puppy to hold it so long.  I use a crate* to potty train with, but only for potty training and then I break it down and store it.  I put blankets and a small food and water dish in the crate.  Dogs don't potty where they eat and sleep.  When they are first little, I only expect them to hold their potty for 4 hours, and then 6 hours, then 8 hours and so on.  So when they are first little, I set a timer or alarm clock to wake myself up at night to take them *out.  I only allow my puppy in the bedroom* or the living room, only one room at a time.  They have to graduate to more space.  If I allow them to have full run of the house, it will overwhelm them.  I take them out the same door each time.  I tie a dinner bell to the door handle.  Do not use a jingle bell as they could get their toe caught in it.  So when they are little, I ring the bell for them, and then open the door to go *outside to potty.  When they get bigger, I take their paw and whack the bell and open the door to go potty.  Eventually getting to the place where the puppy will ring the bell and let me know when they need to go potty.  Dogs want to please you, so it is your job to let them know what behaviors please you and what doesn't.  So when my puppy goes potty, I give her a treat*, and clap, and make a fuss and praise her.  So she learns that going potty outside makes me happy.  If she has an accident, make a disgust sound like tsst and take her out right away.  I never yell* or spank* my puppies.  Take them out when they first wake up, after they eat or drink, before nap, finish romping, when their activities change, or when they are sniffing around. Some puppies go pee right away, but may not go poop until 10 minutes later, so wait for the poop..  I have a little play time here, because sometimes I think they are done, and they are not.  Puppies train at their own pace.  While I may have a puppy that hasn't had an accident in several weeks, I don't let my guard down.  I don't expect my puppies to be "fully potty trained" until one-year-old.  If they have a setback, shake it off, and start over.  I only have my puppies in the crate when I am not watching them.  When I am sleeping, cooking, ironing, doing chores, basically when I am not watching her.  All other times, she is out of the crate practicing being a "big girl."  This is the time I train her how to behave in the house.  So we are practicing "no barking", 'no biting", "no jumping", and "don't eat the furniture."  I also have to practice "playing inside" so she doesn't knock over things.  You must keep the puppy in sight when they are little because they dont know the difference between newspaper and carpet, and you dont want them sneaking off and getting into trouble.   Some puppies can sleep through the night around 3-months-old, but their bladder is grown around 6-months-old.       REVISIONS:    *I use a CRATE to train with.  It is the method I prefer, compared to other methods I have tried.  I noticed that if they are in the crate, while I am doing chores, they are o.k., because the crate allows them to see me and be re-assured.  The crate can also be a comfort when stored in the basement for dogs who live in areas where thunderstorms and tornados are an issue. .  However, use the method that works best for you.....a laundry basket, a cardboard box, a woof-woof house, x-pen, child gates, whatever works for you.   *OUTSIDE, pee pad, litter box, whichever method you are using.   When the puppy is first little, keep the pee pad, litter box near the food and water dish, so the puppy can eat and drink, and then go potty.  You can move it away as they get older.  The pee pad has a scent that smells and initiates potty.  Sometimes a pee pad makes a sound that scares some puppies, so you might want to use a litter box if that happens.  The pee pad allows a puppy to walk around, but a litter box keeps the puppy in one place.   *BEDROOMS, I use the bedroom and living room for training, because it works for me.  Choose rooms that work for you, but watch for rooms that are damp, or drafty.  While my puppies sleep in the bedroom during training, once they are trained, I let them sleep where they want to.  They don't have to sleep in the bedroom forever.   *TREATS.  While I use treats for training, you don't have to.  I like Charlee Bears for training (a little cracker for a little mouth,) I use them for training, but once they are trained, I cut back on them.    *SOME PUPPIES will go potty in the same spot each time.  Some puppies have to be told to go potty.  A command like "go out" for pee, or "go finish" for poop, might work for you, keep saying go finish until the puppy poops.  This is a good thing to train if you travel with your dogs.  By using commands, the puppy won't get confused when you are visiting someone, on vacation with you, or when you get to a new home.  The command will tell them what you want them to do in an unfamiliar place.  You might also want to use a leash method, so the puppy doesnt sneak off, or for strange places.   *YELLING.  It is not a good idea to "yell" or "spank" your puppy and then take them outside when they have an accident.  They may get confused and think that going outside is punishment.  While you want to correct them, if you are extreme, they may not want to go outside again.  Shake it off, and resume your schedule.  You have to keep it real.  Puppies train at their own pace, but a puppy can only hold their potty for a few hours.  A guide would be 1 hour for|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	You should have waited to get a puppy when you were better set up or had more time.

Is there any way you could go home at lunch and let him potty?  If he can hold it all night, then he will be able to hold it during the day as well.|`|LJkPRqN0aa	my personal opinion, is if you cant take the time to spend time with a puppy especially at that age dont get one. puppies need love and a connection with its owner and they cant get that with someone being gone all day. you cannot stop a puppy from peeing unless you actually take the time to train it. if you dont do that then i suggest you dont keep it. because you will still have to keep cleaning up his mess and he will feel neglected..    to misspamelakaren: are we talking about Dogs OR Puppies? dogs are completely different than puppies. i thought you should know the difference just as a heads up...because i never onces mentioned DOGS but PUPPIES.. dogs heck you can leave home all you want. its puppies that need the devotion and love when you first get them.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	At his age he is not physically capable of holding it for more than 4 hours, so making him "learn at this age to hold it" is a pointless and cruel thing to do.  If you can get someone to go over and let him out at least once (preferably twice) during the day that would be ideal.  If that is not an option, then confining him to an easily cleaned room and expecting to pick up a mess every night when you come home is really your only humane option.  He's not really young to be crated all day, but he IS too young to be crated all day without being let out several times during the day.|`|OxFsslN8aa	You cannot make a 3 month old puppy "learn at this age to hold it".  His bladder needs to mature as well as his brain.  I would suggest hiring someone to come and let him out while you are away.  Having a dog is a big responsibility and part of that responsibility is doing what is right for the dog - every day.  Also, the dog is going to have pent up energy and need to release that energy  - it would be great for him if you could walk or run him for about 1/2 hour before you kennel him in the kitchen.  This way he will sleep for most of his time instead of chewing or jumping or crying.|`|eapfTYqpaa	When my puppy was 3 months old, school had started and I had to decide what to do with him. I couldn't trust him roaming around the house because he was still in that chewing stage. So I simply leashed him in my kitchen with all his essentials. It took time for him to get used to, but he eventually put up with it.    In my opinion, I wouldn't house crate my dog. Get a long leash for the dog to roam around in your kitchen or get a gate.|`|Btt44Vtwaa	well bro, i had the same prob few months bak..even my pup was home alone wen i used to go to work.  Actually they get used to it. and in a wayy you will also get used to it. hehehe  well they will create some mess as they are home alone. you just need to train him on weekends as to where he has to poo n pee. whenever you think he wants to go, take him outside. This way he'll learn, so the next time ur out n he needs to poo, he'll definitely go out n poo. thats what my pup learned.  also give him plenty of toys to play as they'll get bored very soon and start destroying stuffs at your place.    hope that solves ur query.

tShDXmgbaa	If she gave birth to 4 fish and they all died...more than likely she is having a premature birth.  It sounds like you have a livebearer of some sort and they give birth to each batch of fry over a period of 3 hours, not a few one days and a few the next day. The plants and rocks did not kill the fry, but perhaps the fry again....was born too early.  The only thing you can do is just wait and til she has her next batch of fry and see what happens.  If your fish is constantly giving birth to dead or premature fry..the mother may have a defect gene in which she can not hold  fry to full term.

p3vjvzRPaa	It depends on what the cause of the bad breath is.    If it's from the mouth, cleaning teeth may help, but make sure that there aren't any dental problems that need vet care (eg a rotten tooth or gum disease).    If teeth/gums are OK, just needing a clean, then there are plenty of dog tooth brushes and toothpaste on the market.  Even a cloth can be used.    To keep teeth clean, give (safe) bones and chew toys designed to keep teeth clean (ask at a pet store or vet).    If the smell is from the gut rather than mouth then a change of diet may help.    You can also get (believe it or not!) doggy breath freshener mints.    There are also natural remedies - some people swear that parsley helps freshen breath (in people and dogs).|`|26PPwzrWaa	Feed raw meaty bones after you get your dog a teeth cleaning.     www.rawfed.com/myths|`|KxjUim7yaa	Changing his food.

ouUblA5Waa	NO you don't punish them when you get home.  they don't understand wht they've done wrong from 3 hours ago.  you need to catch them IN THE ACT and then NO PHYSICAL PUNISHMENT!  just tell them NO and give them something that they CAN have and praise them    they need attention.  you're giving them attention even though its negative attention.    either gate them off with a baby gate or crate them when you're gone.

He may just be going through a late teenage rebellion, so crate him for the few hours that you are gone until he can be trusted in the house again.  it is pointless to punish him after the fact because he doesn't know what he has done.|`|hRikwc00aa	Four things.    1. Exercise. Make sure they get at least two long walks; one in the morning and one in the evening. A tired dog is a good dog!    2. Punishment will not help you at all. Even if you caught them in the act, the dog may not understand what the punishment means. Hours later, he's probably hurt and confused when you scold him. He has no idea what you're doing.    3. Toys. Kongs are great - they can stuffed with kibble and can keep a dog entertained for a long time. While I was chewtoy-training my puppy, I fed her all her food in her Kongs.    4. Crates or a small, dog-proofed room. Obviously they can't be trusted to roam; if you really want to stop their chewing, you'll have to confine them. After a few months being in the crate all day, start gradually letting them roam. Let them have one room at first. If they go a month without destroying anything, give them another room, and so on. If at any time they start chewing again, go back to square one - the crate.    Good luck!|`|qS2ugtlNaa	what is the questian|`|rmxqoXrkaa	My grandma's dogs do the same thing. When they're left alone they get bored, and they might be a little nervous about being home alone. Try giving them toys they can't destroy.

If this doesn't work, every time they do something wrong gently pat their bottom and tell them no.|`|wmVBNzyoaa	well,if they don't stop chewing things lock both in a big or small kennel (your choice)and put food and water NO TOYS!! when you get home let them out.if you see one of the dogs chewing on something punish him/her then keep a habit if it keeps happing ing leave them in their kennel a little longer.

xe7mylLmaa	Time to clear up the usual misinformation...    Crickets and Lettuce is a big no-no.  First off, crickets contain animal protein which iguanas cannot digest properly.  Lettuce contains almost no nutritional content.  The core of an iguana's diet needs to be leafy greens such as Collard Greens, Mustard Greens, Turnip Greens, Dandelion Greens, Watercress, etc.  They need a daily salad with vegetables and fruits mixed in.  Do not buy the iguana pellets or iguana food from pet stores.  They are overpriced and will just wind up killing your iguana anyway. Here is a good food chart to get you going:  http://www.greenigsociety.org/foodchart....     It is perfectly normal for a small iguana that was just purchased to be very finicky about eating.  Most iguanas sold in the pet trade are wild caught - so what you have there is an animal that was forcibly removed from its natural habitat and has now been forced into captivity.  This causes them stress which causes them not to eat.  Iguanas are also creatures of habit, and when they are put in unfamiliar territory (IE a new home) they are forced to find new habits and they lose all sense of security while doing so.  This effects their appetite.    If you are afraid to pick up the iguana, this is a fear you simply must overcome for a few reasons.  First off, to properly tame an iguana you must hold it daily.  Second, if the iguana senses you are afraid of it, it is more likely to realize that it can simply throw a fit and get its way.  Iguanas are notorious for manipulating their owners and you have to show them that you are the boss.|`|nZf1m8TJaa	What are you feeding it if you feed it pellets stop feed it fruit like lettuce tomato and grapes it may be sick take it to the vet and u r supposed to have a red light and a basking bulb       ps dont be afraid to pick it up it wont bite|`|Q6kmIEtaaa	Iguanas can be a challenge even to experienced keepers.  If you are afraid to handle it now when it is a baby, I am going to suggest that you take it back, or give it to someone who can care for it properly.  Iguanas need frequent handling and human interaction every day or else they will bite, tail whip, and be generally awful.      Not to mention the fact that the $20 baby iguana you bought will quickly grow and will eventually reach anywhere from 4-6 feet.      If you are not sure if it is eating, make sure you are offering it the correct foods; lots of dark, leafy greens, other veggies (raw), and a small amount of fruit.     When in doubt, take him to the vet.|`|MvisyrRVaa	Andrew F has a pretty good answer. Fruits are a good source of food. I also feed mine large crickets sometimes. Why are you afraid of it? They wont bite you, but look out for the tail when they get large, they like to swing it around sometimes when you hold them.
Rwz3dkQSaa	Rule of thumb for standard sized horses is 1.5 acre per head [I prefer 2].  That said, it's possible to keep horses on smaller acreage with proper management [clean and safe facilities, hay, and proper exercise].    For a miniature, think 2 on an acre, because they're herd animals and need company. Just make sure your zoning laws will allow you to have a mini.
3h9zGIY3aa	Send the mean one to join the cast of Rock of Love with the other bitches and let Brett Michaels deal with it.  Maybe she'll maul his girly face.|`|VPycXVIlaa	Take them both to behavioral school. You're not a very good wife if you would do that to your husband's dog.|`|1Q4GTAwdaa	There sounds like there is a bit of jealousy going on here, new puppy in the new territory and the likes.    Remember that touch is more important to dogs than talk.    I would suggest getting in a professional to help.    But in the meantime, if you can cordon off the puppy, but where the older dog can see him, toddler gates are great for this.  Let you son play with the puppy.  You (or your husband) with your other dog, make him lie down and calm down in eyesight of the puppy.  Do you best not to make eye contact and touch him a little as possible, until his has calmed right down.  This usually means, lying down, ears completely flat.  If he rolls on his side or back, that would be best.  Try not to let him become fixated on the puppy, distract him.  Curious is good, fixation is not (let the ears tell you what he's thinking).  Once he has done this, give him heaps of praise, pats, cuddles, even a treat.    He will eventually get the idea that you will not tolerate his aggressive behaviour with the puppy and start to accept him.    Once he does it regularly with the gate, then take the gate away and continue the "calming" training.    It will take a little time.  But if you work with him for 15mins to 30mins a day, you will start to see a change quite quickly.    Good Luck|`|1KfbgBupaa	You can't drop the dog off and expect it to fend for its self; that's animal abuse.    Try contacting Cesar on Dog Whisperer.      Jealousy is a terrible thing among pets.  We've got it between our younger cat and the older (who's almost 17).  Because of this, the youngster weighs 14 pounds because she has to eat when the older one does, whom we're trying to keep up her body weight, and the youngster chases the older one.|`|v0RsFaAzaa	I would think he's acting like this, because he's jealous of the new puppy and the new puppy has now invaded the territory that used to be his! I think that when he gets aggressive toward the puppy that maybe he's trying to protect his territory! He may also feel that the puppy is getting more attention than he is used to getting himself!The only thing I can tell you is, to call an Animal Behaviorist or Trainer. I will star this question and maybe some of my contacts can help you more. Good Luck!
hfu63hoxaa	she is ok! just be aware they might be very protective of themselves ans they new puppies|`|3giaPYe8aa	She's resting up for the big event.  She knows she has a lot of work ahead of her.  Also, you would be tired, too, if you were carrying around a "wide load".|`|JsBb732Maa	All dogs can be different at the end of a pregnancy, if she is eating, drinking water, maybe less than before then she should be OK. I had a dog once that towards the end of her pregnancy she wouldn't walk, I panicked and took her to the vet and he said that with the extra weight she was just not wanting to walk much. She had her litter and all was good. Good luck with your puppies. :-)|`|htSZsds7aa	Yes, even humans get very tired near our due dates. Let her rest and have a nesting spot for her ready.

JfBzzXQ4aa	I've raised 3 Border Collie pups & an Aussie. I'm around young Border Collies on a daily basis. All I've ever had to do for puppy mouthing is: "AHH!"  Loud enough to get the dog's attention & make them pause, take my arms & cross them over my chest , look the dog right in the eye & tell him "NO" in a stern voice. Wait a few minutes & then I can put my hands back out. If they do it again, repeat. Now when the kids play with him you will need to be there & help them do this (100% of the time, because consistency is the key until he learns. The kids excited squeels when he bites will excite him & make the behavior harder to control. Those are the kinds of noises that set a lot of BC's off.)  He bites at the kids, you immediately tell him "AHH" & have the kids take their hands away & cross their arms over their chests. Look him straight in the eye & tell him the stern "NO". Have the kids when they start playing with him again, play with a toy. He bites & pulls the toy, OK. He mouths kids, not OK. He'll learn this, hang in there. Good Luck.|`|AA11992723	I have a border collie mix (part retriever) i dont think this is indicative to just BCs though:) All puppies bite mostly because they explore their new world by their mouths and theyre teething. by 6 months old, the nipping is significantly if not totally stopped. Try to not use forceful or scary training with your BC. they are very sensitive and shut down with punishment.     If the biting is really bothering or hurting your girls, you can buy bitter apple spray at petco or any pet store, spary it on the girls hands or whereever the dog is nipping. it deters the biting.    one of my dogs is a jack russell terrier, known for their sharp puppy biting stage. my BC mix though would actually react worse if i made a loud noise or put my hand in his mouth. i think he thought it was a game or just got overexcited by it. what worked with him was when he started puppybiting i just always got his frisbee and put it in his mouth saying "get your frisbee" he learned that command and whenever started nipping, he'd stop and get the frisbee.|`|AA12128656	this isn't just a BC problem, it's an 11 week old pup problem.  you may need to do a bit more to make the little guy understand that mouthing is unacceptable. if you are training him for a pet, then you can do the following. if he's to be trained for herding, then i don't know, because i've never trained a herding dog in my life, and wouldn't know the first thing about the groundwork for that... (i only train pets and protection dogs)    when he mouths you, you may need to make it unpleasant for him. since you have tried gentler methods, with failure, then the best thing to do is stop this behavior now. (obviously it's unacceptable for him to "mouth" your young children!)    when you feel his teeth on you, give his lip a pinch. you don't need to make it painful, but get a good hold on the lip. and then don't let go for a second. he'll struggle a bit, and then you can release him. he'll learn that every time his teeth touch your hand (or leg, or whatever) that he gets stuck. and he'll stop, and very quickly.    the key is to not make it painful, just hold him enough so that he feels stuck.    then, immediately play with him with a rope tug or an appropriate toy to chew on, and praise him when he mouths or chews the toy. this will also help to reinforce positive chewing habits (as opposed to chewing on your furniture!)|`|JsBb732Maa	You can take his lip and pinch it against his teeth and tell him no bite! He will not enjoy that so will stop.|`|aL4UoRdTaa	Hi.  I am not a dog trainer.  But I just quickly wanted to reinforce the first answer.  I have a collie mix too.    I think the idea of having your dog get a toy when he is doing this is a great idea.  Our collie responded really well to this. Also it is a good technique to stop a dog from jumping up.  You make sure they have a toy in their mouth to great you when you get home and it can get them focused on the toy instead of jumping up.  We taught our dog the "toy" command and she learned it very quickly.  Good Luck!
v0RsFaAzaa	It sounds like your dog has Bloat! Bloat will kill your dog in less than an hour, if you don't get him to a vet NOW! Bloat is a VERY PAINFUL WAY TO DIE, FOR THE DOG!!!  Bloat is the second leading cause of death in dogs, next to Cancer.THIS IS AN EMERGENCY!!! You need to turn your computer off and GO!!!  http://www.globalspan.net/bloat.htm|`|3giaPYe8aa	Yes it could be serious.  It could be Gastric Torsion.

It sounds like bloat, or gastric dilation. The stomach basically fills up with air. Left untreated, it can quickly become volvulus, where the stomach turns on itself, blocking blood flow to the stomach and other organs.     Some breeds, espcecially those with deep chests, are predisposed to this condition.     THIS IS A VETERINARY EMERGENGY!    Call your emergency vet or the nearest clinic, even if its not your vet, immediately to let them know you are coming in with a dog who is bloating. Then get there - FAST.     If it was early stages I would suggest simethicone, but it sounds too late for that - just drop everything and GO!    ETA: It *may* be treatable, if caught early. The vet will deflate the stomach, and may do surgery to "tack" the stomach to the wall of the chest to prevent twisting if it happens again. Many cases need surgical intervention, especially if there has been any torsion (twisting). Sadly in many cases, there's too much internal damage and the dog must be euthanized (sorry to say this, but it is the reality).    If he pulls through, you will *always* need to educate yourself on bloat and always be on the lookout for signs, which sometimes can be subtle.     Here is a link from a Great Dane forum that has some great info on bloat:   http://www.dolforum.com/forum/showthread...    You will hear a million and one things that people claim to help with bloat. The  1 agreed upon source seems to be stress, so you will need to try to keep your dog's environment as stress free as possible. You may also want to research diet, feeding techniques, etc.     My fingers are crossed for you.. I hope he pulls through okay.|`|c6nZXqglaa	Ya know it could be pregnat people or its stomach bloat and you need to go to the vet now! ASAP! GO!!!!!!!!!!!
u3Hdoeiqaa	What a horrible situation!<br>  <br>  I will try to break it down to cover everything...<br>  <br>  1) The cage they are in now is totally unsuitable - it is only useful as a travelling box, not permanent housing! Mice need plenty of room - at least a 20 gallon tank or a large cage. If you decide on a cage you may want to wait until they are fully grown, and then ensure the bars are less than 1cm apart.<br>  <br>  2) You also need to get a water bottle asap! Bowls are not recommended as they get soiled very quickly, contaminating the water. It will do for now, but please get a bottle immediately.<br>  <br>  3) Mice are usually paired for breeding at only 10 weeks old, although they can reproduce well before then. Please get them separated NOW. It is possible the female is already pregnant - in which case you can expect babies in under 3 weeks. Female mice also go through "post-partum oestrus", ie they come on heat immediately after giving birth. If the male is present, they will mate, and you could have a second litter only 3 weeks after the first - and you could have 12 pups in each!<br>  <br>  Mice are a social species. For the time being separate them - if possible adopt another female to keep you one company. If the male is still very young it may be possible to introduce him to another young male, otherwise you could consider having him neutered and returning him to the female afterwards.<br>  <br>  Usually I would never recommend keeping mice alone - but if because of your dad it is either that or breeding, it would be better to keep them apart.<br>  <br>  4) As long as the pups are weaned, age is irrelevant when it comes to proper care and housing. They need a decent cage, some nesting material, a house to sleep in, a solid running wheel and plenty of toys, eg things to climb, toilet roll tubes etc.<br>  <br>  5) Obviously you need to keep the mice safe from the cats. Is there a room in the house the cats do not go in? If so, keep the mice in there with the door closed. This is another reason for a proper cage, one that is secure, so the mice can't get out and the cats can't get in.<br>  <br>  You are right - you should NOT put the cage in a cupboard! Shutting any animal in a dark enclosed space, with no light, ventialtion etc is abuse.<br>  <br>  I am sorry you are in this situation, and I hope you can help these mice. Well done for trying!<br>  If money is an issue you may be able to find a cheap cage / tank and toys etc second hand - just wash before use.<br>  <br>  For the best mouse care info please visit <a href="http://www.allaboutmice.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.allaboutmice.co.uk/</a>|`|8zqmIEzVaa	a good way to care for mice is to feed them to my snake =]|`|BWez86Ldaa	My gosh! I suggest visiting www.goosemoose.com and getting some care info about mice! <br>  <br>  Tanks are not good for *any* animals. Ammonia builds up and causes respiratory problems. <br>  <br>  Female + Male = TONS of babies, and directly after she births she will get pregnant again. <br>  <br>  Wheels and toys are a must.
YQfEOeStaa	If all physical ailments have been discounted and your dog has been given a clean bill of health, then the next thing I would look for is his emotional health. Whether we admit it or not, anger and hostility in people is based on fear, whether it be deep-rooted or not. This is the same with animals (unless trained to attack on command).<br>  <br>  Whether this fear be linked to anxiety, mental disorders, or what not, my first suggestion (after a clean bill of health) would be to use flower essences. These are amazing -- on people AND animals. <br>  <br>  If you do a google search for "flower essences aggression in animals" you will find many great sources, and, in my experience, it has worked 100% of the time. They are inexpensive -- probably about $15 to solve the problem. Cheaper than a vet visit or meds.<br>  <br>  Please, even if you don't think my answer is the best, try flower essences. They will work. For the sake of your beloved dog!|`|B7ciNw0aaa	Get a vet check. It could be an ear infection, split paw, ect.|`|b4NcFBhraa	Like Ellen said, it might be a physical problem. But then again... Do you have children in the house? has the dog been smacked/hit? Do you own another dog? If you do own another dog, Do you give IT mroe attention than your lab/boxer?<br>  I'd try looking over the dog for cuts or rashes or anything that could be wrong with him/her.<br>  Next, if something IS wrong, take him/her ot the vet.<br>  If nothing looked wrong, try asking kids around the house(if any) if they've physically harmed the dog in any way (this includes, kicking, hitting, punching, slapping, flicking, picking the dog up wrong, stepping on the feet, etc...)<br>  If they say no then I'd call a dog behaviorist.

84558de0349fa374ed3605ac33e8e36daa	I'm sorry but why do you get dogs if you're hardly ever home and therefore not able to spend time with them? You should have the time or take the time to train them properly. <br>  You can put them in a crate when you're not home but they still shouldn't be locked up all day. <br>  Anyway, you can tell when your dog needs to go. He will sniff around and you can see it by its body language that he has to go. Watch him and when you notice that he needs to go, put him on the potty sheets or even better, take him outside. Reward him when he goes where you want him to go!!|`|yCR6qg0baa	Those potty pads don't magically attract your dogs lol. You have to train them to use them. Ours used to sleep on them and chew them.<br>  <br>  Crate training is the BEST, fastest, and easiest way to potty train your dog. Buy a crate from Petco, Petsmart, or Walmart & set it to a small size (big enough for them to sleep in, but not big enough to play in. Dogs won't pee or poop in "their area" (which is what their crate is). At night, when you're sleeping, put your puppies in their crate(s). Get up a few times at night, put them on a leash, and IMMEDIATELY take them outside. Don't worry about shoes & jackets-- they'll pee on the carpet right away if you don't get them out fast enough. Don't bring them back in until they've done their business. Put them back in their crates. In the morning, when you wake up, take them out to potty & then bring them back in. They only need to be in their crates at night and whenever you're not home. Since they're so little, take them out to pee once an hour, on the hour when you're home. Feed them twice a day, but don't just leave their food out all the time. They need to poop right after they eat. Set a pad by the door(s) so they have somewhere to go potty even if they don't make it outside. It will take a month or two, and then they'll be house-broken & as they get older, you can take them out less and less.<br>  <br>  When you take them out, take them to the SAME spot each time (this way they don't think you're playing). Give them a treat every time they do their business outside. <br>  <br>  Spoiling a puppy only makes training more difficult on you & more confusing for them. They're not babies that need to sleep with you at night. They'll be fine snuggled together in their crates.|`|9kTejB0uaa	Two blacks here - two puppies at the same time, and you are not there too often!!!  This is going to take a LONG TIME to sort out!  And until they get big enough to hold their pee/pooh, you are going to have a lot of mess to clear up.<br>  <br>  Crates might help, although how long are these two being left on their own for?  Puppies need to go out at least every 2 hours, probably more often depending on how old they currently are.  They need to go out immediately after they have woken up, say 10 minutes after they have eaten, after a period of play time and many time more.  And there are no short-cuts.<br>  <br>  In other words, the more they are going to be left on their own, the less they are going to be able to learn, and the longer it's going to take.<br>  <br>  You are darned lucky it's just a housetraining issue - Labradors chew, and can destroy the house if they are left alone and bored.<br>  <br>  Please rethink what you have done, and if your current life-style doesn't allow for you to be there, it might be better to call it quits with these two now.

IzRk1mZQaa	A female cat is capable of getting pregnant at 6 months old.  A female does not have to be in heat for a male to mate with her, nor does she have to be in heat to get pregnant.  If it is the base of her tail, my guess is she lost her virginity today, she's pregnant, and doesn't really like the father of her kittens all that much.    If the kittens survive from such a young mother, when they are 8 weeks old, please take your female to be spayed.  Its the responsible thing to do.  I don't think what you did today was very responsible.    Wait - did you add that you are not going to have your cat spayed???????  I change my answer - the problem with your cat is that she is living in the wrong home - you should get her to right home RIGHT AWAY, where responsible owners would have this poor thing at the Vets Office on a regular basis.|`|mV1VqBWhaa	idk|`|L9MDzufnaa	SHE NEEDS TO BE SPAYED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|3c49a0964bbe36e70dcf40e56a9d58d6aa	A cat in heat often puts up a fight before she will allow a male cat to mount her.

All female cats act that way when they're in heat and near a male cat.  To female cats mating is VERY painful, a male cats penis has barbs on it that scratch into the female cat every time he goes in and comes out, this pain is what causes a female cat to ovulate.  So for obvious reasons female cats are all going to do this when in the presence of a male, and of course she doesn't like it when you touch her tail because she doesn't know if it's you or the barbed penis that's out to get her, she's paranoid, and it's normal.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Nothing is "rong " with your cat.|`|RarSAK4Haa	you do know there is a "w" in front W"rong"|`|S3pgtJGpaa	Kittens are not used to other cats, and they are not as friendly to other cats.

vLWs9Gbsaa	Yeah getting it spayed is usually the right answer. Although, my friend got a kitten and it turned out it was taken from his Mother way too early, so it didnt know how to 'be' a cat, so it used to just run round the house going nuts, scratching folk and destroying stuff.     Also, cats can be like this if they are 'House Cats' and dont get out the house.|`|IzRk1mZQaa	Is your persian spayed?  If not that would help a lot.  Is she healthy?  Make sure she has other toys to play with, make sure she is not sharing food bowls or a litter box with the other cat - cats like their own things.  If worse comes to worse - your best training tool is a squirt gun.  Every time she attacks, squirt her.  It might take a week or two, but she will stop.|`|htSZsds7aa	I knew a cat that was like that, but once she got spayed, it all stopped.|`|af42f925d28ffec0c10e36b8d1d58efcaa	Hold the cat A LOT!

cGRyDCpQaa	"Equestrians need to have the concentration and ability to judge distance like a golfer, strength and stamina of a hockey player, artistic flow and ability to make a hard thing look easy and beautiful like a gymnast, and and also know where everyone around them is at all times ALL WHILE controlling a 1000lb or more animal with your hands, back, neck, shoulders, thighs, calves, legs, heels, stomach, or basically every bone/muscle in your body with the help of a 5 inch piece of metal.

Should be able to get some stuff out of that... just don't steal it, lol.    Telling people it's in the olympics simply isn't enough. "Table tennis is in the olympics and it isn't a sport."    Write facts about how people have died from horses - getting kicked, falling off, being crushed, etc. Tell about the injuries we get just from falling to the ground. Tell about how much calories we burn just from riding an hour compared to other sports (there was a mention about it on a website a while back - you should be able to find it through google.)    Talk about the rodeo aspects of the sport, too. You should be able to get a lot about that from google.    Go on about how much balance is required, and make sure to mention it's nothing like going on a commercial trail ride. Including some pictures of people falling would be nice too. I've been hoping someone would make something like this.|`|yDgYSHvaaa	Wow, all of mine have been taken already.

You can't MAKE people believe anything.|`|QdQcAHqaaa	There is muscle involvement just to stay balanced on the horse, let alone get it to move. Furthermore, the endurance of riding a horse, especially in jumping, is equivalent to any other sport.  The risk of injury is greater on a horse, because not only can you damage your own body in a fall, there is a 1000 lb animal that can fall on you, kick you, or bite you making the injury much more intense.  There is more finesse involved than most people think; as a 100-200 lb person you have to control a much more powerful animal using body language and disciplined muscle control.  It is not just a passive sport, the rider has to constantly be aware of leg placement and pressure, hand placement, stride and pace, calculate how far it is to a jump and whether to go for the long jump or the short jump to get over the post.      Horse back riding is all about strength, endurance, style, control, and self-awareness at all times.  For those who think that what we do is easy, I challenge them to do a hunter-jumper course for one hour and then tell them that we don't do any work.|`|YQgSrJI6aa	- most leg strength than most sports  - rearing , bucking , taking off.

Polo is a sport and no one can say otherwise.  For all the other equestrians out there, do you get a work out sitting the trot? Doing dressage? Jumping? Yes. Then of course it's a sport. They consider speed walking a sport, and Curling same with bridge, billiards, Nascar, speedboat racing too!  The definition of a sport is:  Sport is an activity that is governed by a set of rules or customs and often engaged in competitively.  Is horse back riding competitive? Check  Is it governed by a set of rules? Check    If you look up "sport" on Wikipedia, they have a picture of a show jumper with a caption "Show jumping is an equestrian Sport"|`|6GehblM3aa	Here is a dictionary definition of sport:  http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/s...

It is in the olympics, and if you google it you will get tons of info.   Plus any sport you do you get sore if you do it after a while right? well anything you do on horse back you get sore. you also need a lot of training and constitution to ride, and compete on horses.|`|z3Z7AQWPaa	I always say...yes the horse does most of the work but none of it would get done if it wasn't for the rider telling the horse how. And in order to do that you have to know how to communicate to them in such a way that they will preform most athletically and in a way that benefits them. In doing so you use your entire body. It's not just kick to go and pull to stop. That's what you learn on weekend trail rides...    I never expect people to understand though.|`|BfBMRlNNaa	Put any non rider on the back of a horse and tell me they don't have sore muscles the next day!|`|vfhKkiSKaa	If it is not a sport, it is the only non-sport in the Olympics!|`|sgfzicr9aa	If horse back riding wasn't a sport it wouldn't be in the Olympics|`|an1L8njXaa	Its an olympic sport,  oh and there has been studies showing that an hours hard lesson (one where you break a sweat and cant walk afterwards, the best type of lesson in my oppinion) burns more calories then jogging.

bDPVRtCNaa	The tank is already extremely overstocked.    Why is the tank heated? Goldfish are coldwater fish. That is terrible for their health. Heated water will reduce their lifespan.    ~Koi require no less than 1000 gallons as adults.     Adult size: At least two feet long.    ~Common goldfish require a minimum of 55 gallons, adding twenty gallons for every additional common goldfish.     Adult size: At least one foot long    ~Fancy goldfish (black moors) need at least 20 gallons, adding ten gallons for every additional fancy goldfish.    Adult size: 6-8 inches    -Please try to find these fish suitable homes.    ~EDIT~   If the fish is not a koi, than what is he? Does he have barbels?  Are you certain you mean 29 feet?  The answer is still the same despite the correction. Angelfish cannot be housed with coldwater fish.|`|a2cjwMKcaa	Not a good idea.

psnaJcvpaa	I have 2 cats of my own..Salem who is 3 yrs and Baloo who is 8 months old.. Baloo uses a cat box cos she is a housecat (she is a Russian Blue)    I have also previously owned cats for years...    Cats and kittens generally stand on their 2 hind legs and slightly lift their front paws when they go for a number two's. This is perfectly normal and nothing to worry about. However, if they are slightly constipated, they will stand quite high on their hind legs as if they are standing up straight.This is still nothing to worry about. Just increase their water intake, and give her a bit more softer food.    With reference to the second video on you tube.. omg, why the hell are they letting that poor cat go to the toilet in the bath???!!! Madness|`|bZhIEy1Waa	Ooh calm down mate, we're not all the same on here and if you think you've received a nasty answer there are steps you can take to remove that answer! Theres nothing wrong with your kitten having a poo whilst its standing up - they're all different in the own unique little ways - my 6 year old Jack Russell poo's standing up and he lifts his back leg into the bargain - how's that for a show-off ha ha! Its a quirk of your kitten's and is unique to him - he may grow out of it, he may not but its certainly nothing to fret over! He may have a little stomach upset due to the change in his diet but it'll pass ( excuse the pun - none intended ) and besides, if he's going to experience life to the full then he'll be trying lots and lots of different foods and food textures. Try him on all kinds of different food, don't just stick to the one he has, cats love variety in their diets and although i'd stop short of catching him a mouse ha ha some different food will only strengthen his stomach and bowels! Going to the loo standing up is ok, he's not ill in any other way so chalk it up to him being him - funny and quirky. Best of luck to you both.|`|YBcB0732aa	My cat doesn't stand up like this cat does.-http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfVazaUEG...

Feeding your cat grilled chicken might change the texture of you cats poop not the way it stands up.|`|acb7W30saa	Some cats just poop that way especially kittens it's kind of like how some male dogs squat to pee instead of lifting their leg, your kitty is okay.  Plus give your cat some privacy they don't like to be watched doing their business anymore then you do. :)
pvgwJwxvaa	it really just depends on what caused the kidney failure.  she is a bit young for it.  did she get into anything?  if it is acute kidney failure, sometimes it can be reversed.  if it is chronic kidney failure it could go either way.  depending on how high her values are would help determine the survival rate.  generally dogs with chronic kidney failure have a much shorter life span.  they just dont do well with it.  long term treatment can be as simple as changing her diet to one that is low protein and low sodium to as complex as giving sub q fluids periodically at home.
iXijnCxOaa	Take her to the vet... get her spayed.. end of issue.|`|SX8z4fNtaa	i think it looks like shes pregnant man i cant tell how far along but she was a stray so the original owner might have just drove to a random street and left her because shes pregnant so she might just be as pregnant for how long uve owned her|`|PM23RDycaa	Time for a trip to the vet.

Having her spayed sounds a really good idea.|`|3kWY91m8aa	Its hard to be completely sure she is pregnant. She could just be getting fat, but seeing as you picked her up as a stray and she probably is not spayed, there's a big chance she is pregnant. I recommend that you take her to a veterinarian and get her checked out.  Even if she ends up not being pregnant its good to get her vaccinated and just looked over by a vet so neither you nor her get sick.|`|RFfTjnxzaa	Go to the vet and have an ultrasound performed.    If she's that far along in her pregnancy, if I were you, I'd let the pregnancy take its course.|`|7mLvb0rNaa	yes she might just be getting fat... or give it few more weeks and if she starts getting utters like a cow then she is defanitly prego!!!|`|EPo7N1xBaa	Being that her nipples are dropping, that means she either had a litter of pups in the past or she's pregnant. If her tummy gets alot bigger and rounder closer to her possible due date, then she's pregnant. Good luck.
1gDTiPVyaa	I'm pretty sure that's normal--cockatiels are notorious for having bald spots on their heads.   Look up the web sites listed below--they will have articles on cockatiel baldness.  Congrats and good luck with your babies.|`|q1qvs1oyaa	It is normal for all birds,to lose there first crop of hair on there heads,they grow back there feathers,at 8 weeks old they will look totally differant,so don't panic alls well.|`|lFkVFZgoaa	well, they might be malting|`|wlWzAL4yaa	Are these teils in a box with their parents?    Sometimes when tiels (and other types of birds) want to mate and breed again they will attempt to kick the babies out of the nest. If you see them doing this it looks like they are trying to pick the young up by the feathers around the head.  It is generally the male that does this, as he wants the attention of the hen back on him.    If this is happening the problem is that if the young don't leave the nest there is a chance of the parents killing them. The parents will go from plucking feathers to actually attacking them.  The other problem is that if they are kicked from the nest the parents may not continue to feed them and they will starve.    Please let us know the exact situation...are they still in the box with parents, already fledged, or being hand raised? This will help us to know what could be the cause.|`|AA10207797	all cockateils will have a bald head under the crown its totally normal even adults  own 13 off them and all are bald under the crown also because they are 5 weeks old mom and dad are more likely plucking them when they are weaned and out on thier own they will grow the feathers back good luck
6CjCaVaXaa	if i were in your situation i would bring the lab to a trainer to train the lab to have good manners to other dogs|`|C1eHfhrHaa	Is the new puppy a male of female?  Some dogs are same-gender aggressive.  The vet has the right idea, but also leash the lab and give an immediate correction by snapping the leash at the first sign of aggression.  And obviously, don't leave them alone for a second unsupervised and only allow the dobe in with the pup when the lab is not there.  That will hopefully get the dobe used to the pup- you may just have to always keep them separated.|`|velIdcbNaa	This is perfectly normal.  The lab is simply is simply saying that he is the boss.  It will take time for them to get used to each  other, so don't force them. let them move at their own pace, never force them to get near each other.  You don't have to get rid of the puppy if they argue for a while, because it takes a while.    My grandma brought home a puppy when i was there ( i helped pick it out!) and her older rottie didn't like it one bit.  When they were introduced through the glass, the rottie was perfectly fine with it, but when the pup got home in his "territory" is when the problems started. It takes a while, but now the two dogs are like brothers.|`|ibeAA3RAaa	You need to consult a behaviorist. muzzling the lab doesn't solve the problem, it simply stops the lab from biting when the muzzle is on. You need to learn how to deal with the situation now while the puppy is still little. The most important part of all of this is that your dobi and your lab and your new puppy need to understand that you are the head of the pack. Clearly this is not the case because the lab felt it was ok to attack the puppy despite your displeasure. A behaviorist can help you learn to communicate in way that your dogs will understand so that they do as they are told. This situation will not get better, it will only get worse if you don't get help. Otherwise, bring the puppy back to the breeder while it is still small enough to be adopted to a good home.    http://www.doggonehairy.net/

So, i opened the wheel and stuck him in there and he eventually had to come out, so he went down the tube. Once after that he started using the tube to get to the wheel because i forced him to discover it. I suggest to take your hamster and put it on the top floor, it will know there's a downstairs and got down the tube. You could also maybe put it's favite food in the tube so the hammy could go in.|`|aDeDOmxBaa	I have an idea,    If you make it so that the tubes do not go up vertical and go across  so that the living areas are next to eachother (rather than above one another) then she will be walking flat to get to each area. These work great with the lager varieties because their body size holds them in but the smaller ones struggle to get up and free fall back down!       Hopefully you get what i mean!  You can build from both sides and connect another, put a tube round the back etc etc the lists are endless with these! Basically keelp all the rooms on flat levels or one small raise so that there is little to no climbing. I think you can also purchase little wire ladders that you can hook on the inside of the tubes with the hooks over the top of the tube if you really need to go upwards with the tubes.    Hope this helps!    Gem x|`|AA11305153	If you physically place the hamster in the area where the water bottle is, he will have to climb down the tube to get anywhere else in the cage.  Don't worry too much about it.  Dwarfs are extremely curious animals and love learning new things.  He will get the hang of the new tube.  Just make sure he knows where the water bottle is and the attic place.
QdQcAHqaaa	Race is an antiquated way that anthropologists in the 17- and 1800's explained groups of people that looked noticeably different from each other.  Since that time, you will notice that no one refers any more to the "Asian race" or the "Caucasian race" because science shows that the concept of race doesn't exist. There is no genetic way to tell which "race" someone belongs to.  That is why now there is only the "human race;" people realized that humans cannot be broken down into different biological categories.      So, to answer your question, there is no dog or cat race because race is not a biological classification, and there was no need for people to break them down into social groups.|`|3giaPYe8aa	It's not race, it's species.  Dogs are Canines and Cats are Felines.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Cause cats won't race unless chased by dogs and that is just plan cruel.

3p6wp7DYaa	How old is he? How much exercise does he get? How about mental stimulation?     Most dogs' problem chewing is caused by boredom. He needs to get out and run around, play with other dogs, wrestle, and chase. He also needs exercise for his brain, like learning commands, tricks, and playing with interactive toys. If you tire him out everyday, then stimulate his brain for a while, he will be too wiped out to chew your carpets.     You should also give him something to chew instead of the carpet. Some dogs go for nylabones and kongs, others need something they can tear apart. My dog loves bully sticks more than anything in the world. They are not full of nasty chemicals like the rawhides, and they keep him focused and out of trouble for as long as the stick lasts (and some of them are HUGE). For a little dog like yours, a tiny stick will do the trick for a long time. Check out this article by the Humane Society: http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/our_pe...|`|pvgwJwxvaa	have you taken him to the vet?  he could have a partial obstruction making him nauseous and that could be why he is eating carpet or he could have a mild seizure disorder.  how old is he?|`|hRikwc00aa	Crate him at night and when you're not home, and keep a close eye on him while you're home.

XPB6Ogj0aa	Oh boy!  CHOLOCATE IS A DEADLY POISON TO CATS AND DOGS.  If your cat ate chocolate, watch it very carefully because this acts on the heart, dehydration, vomiting, convulsions, seizures, etc.  Call the vet or emergency clinic immediately.  Some cats can tolerate this poison better than others, but you need profession advice.

It's dogs that have the issue with chocolate.  Your cats are probably going to have diarrhea, lucky you!!!    Seriously, I have to add after reviewing the answers, a small amount of chocolate will only upset your cats tummy.  It would take more than your cat could eat in one sitting to make it "die" or it would have to pig out on chocolate every day, I found another answer source - http://www.answerbag.com/q_view/9414.  Or just google "cats and chocolate".  Stray cats and healthy bored outdoor cats eat out of the garbage all the time,  You'd be surprised what they can tolerate, but not that you were,  its no reason to be irresponsible with their diet.|`|aqFEUmwgaa	may have loose motion.

p3vjvzRPaa	That's a really hard situation.  Some people (including some RSPCAs) think food, water and shelter is all that is needed.    Clearly a dog does need more than just a yard to play in - they need mental stimulation.  It's not natural for a dog to live it's life on just one patch of ground - like being in prison.    But, I guess when you think about it, there are plenty of people doing far far worse things to their dogs.    If the dogs aren't grossly overweight and aren't barking out of boredom then you have probably done all you can do and best to just let it go.    If there are health issues or noise issues, then you could try again with the RSPCA or other organisations.|`|46eedfcc0d431f5086b7b4cfa950eb57aa	My neighbors don't walk their dog either and all it does is bark   We don't talk any more either   Some people just don't care about their pets.|`|ofUe4hBkaa	You could try and contact the RSPCA again, and tell them it is still not getting better.  Or you could ask to adopt them or walk them.  I KNOW IM GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF THUMBS DOWN FOR THIS BUT...  i Know it is cruel in our eyes but i dont think the RSPCA will do anything as its not truely cruel, its not like there being abused or tortued (sp)      jenVT- a dog needs more then just a run around in the yard.  every dog no matter what the breed needs at least two walks for a minimum of 'half an hour' each time.|`|349e849aefd868c83f57e318b5cee8d2aa	people like that get me annoyed to part of having a dog is to take it on walks .maybe you could phone up  a animal rescue centre for advice seeing RSPCA  was rubbish good luke|`|cYsPx9sSaa	walk the dogs for them...|`|C1eHfhrHaa	I don't walk my dogs either- they have a fenced yard to play in.|`|hRikwc00aa	Besides offering to walk their dogs for them, there's not much you can do.|`|61c8oevtaa	You could try offering to walk the dogs for them? I don't really know what else to suggest.    I have a Border Collie and she gets 2 hours plus of walks every day, and she would happily do more. She would go crazy with no exercise, that's really sad =[|`|UidC9N0Caa	Ask if you can take the dogs a walk yourself...|`|K162hc5haa	tell that that you would love to have a dog but for such and such reason you cant, so would it be ok if you walked theirs for a bit.|`|KFu7596Paa	sad them dogs must get board aspecially the collie   i know people like that.  im in the uk and ive only just got back in theres no point in getting dogs if you dont walk them   if i never walked mika my younger dog he would go so hyper i would not be able to stop him going mad     anyway people who dont walk them dont deserve them plus they have problems going to poo they need exercise to help the bowl thats what i were told dont know the truth of the matter as mine always go for long walks and there only small terriers  now my dogs are sound both asleep happy     maybe you should try speaking to them about it if not speak to the rspca again   i thought collies needed alot of exercise or they go mad    good luck|`|EJOqYvMZaa	not sure you should label people surely if they were chavs they would have a staff|`|7uCfW237aa	I am in the same situation, although not quite that bad. Across the road they have 8 cats and 4 dogs. They seem to only walk one dog for 10 minutes a day. Very energetic dogs and so lovely. I dont feel like it is my place to walk them though. I already give a couple of their cats a warm place to sleep if the house is too noisy...  But yeah, im sure they would appreciate if you ask to walk their dogs, most people can be more open minded than you think. Yes it could be seen as a little offensive and overbearing but its still a generous offer at heart.|`|RtHHHFN5aa	i think you should ring the RSPCA and they will help you,  or you should walk them for your neighbour's.|`|chpYJzInaa	The RSPCA are a load of cack, they make me bleeding sick.  Contact the local dog warden at your local council. Go on your local councils website and you will find them. I have found them more helpful then The RSPCA . I know how you feel, I have complained about my neighbours pup out in the rain and tied up and all the RSPCA say he has shelter and food etc. His shelter is an upended broken part of a table and his food and water are out of reach of his tethering pole. Just riduculous why some peope have animals.|`|iVQULHqYaa	The RSPCA cannot do anything if the dogs have food and shelter. Its a sad fact of life that people abuse and neglect their dogs.It would be wonderful if we could stop people breeding dogs and if we could stop  the so called responsible breeders from selling their puppies to idiots.     There are answerer's on this site who tell  people who want to buy a dog and leave it alone all day that it is OK to do so. Teenagers decide to co habit and they want a dog and the answerer's tell them which breed that can be left alone all day.    Dogs are abused by people who think that they care.A huge % of dogs have a miserable life and some of the daft answerer's condone this by their stupid advise.|`|QXhfiYanaa	If it bothers you that much offer to walk them .
81675c7bcc2aa81478472216e01229f7aa	I know Rabies vaccinations is the law.  Only your vet can answer whether or not he should continue to be vaccinated.    ADD:  Vaccinate for rabies virus according to the law, except where circumstances indicate that a written waiver needs to be obtained from the primary care veterinarian. In that case, a rabies antibody titer can also be performed to accompany the waiver request.  http://www.doglogic.com/vaccination.htm|`|3zv2bbolaa	I wouldn't recommend it. I do not administer rabies or any other vaccination to any of my dogs over ten years of age- my vet issues an exception letter on behalf of my elderly dogs.|`|p7swtBYzaa	What does your vet advise?    You could have a titer done to see if your dog still has immunity for the rabies virus - most vaccinations last a lot longer than originally thought.    You know there are 2 kinds of rabies vaccine, don't you?  Ask your vet about that and perhaps use the other one, not the one he used last time.|`|pvgwJwxvaa	talk to your vet about doing rabies titers in lieu of the vaccine.|`|ea073a7e51b6c89785bcfc0713212cf2aa	No- just stop giving them.  You can get a note from your vet saying the dog's age and health prevent him from receiving a rabies vaccine, and nobody will bother you about it.  Vaccinating elderly dogs can easily kill them.  It's not worth it.|`|AA11947327	There are several different brands of Rabies vaccines, but they are all the same in that they can all cause reactions in dogs.      If you dog has already had one reaction, they each time he gets a Rabies vaccine, the reaction will be worse.  Hopefully, you are in a state that allows a waive from the vaccine requirement.  Your dog should not have any further Rabies (or other) vaccines.  Ask your vet about getting a waiver.  Look up the duration of immunity on canine vaccines on the web.  All vaccines are good for many years.|`|3IApfZopaa	My dogs are all exempt from rabies at 7 years old, talk to your vet about it.
cXK9sY1raa	Sixteen pellets a day!? I'm in shock that it hasn't exploded from constipation! I feed mine two or three!    I'm in the UK but I have picked up from forums that a US med called maracyn 2 (I think my spelling is correct) is good for clearing up finrot in bettas. He does look pretty bedraggled to me...    Adding aquarium salt would also aid his regrowth but check it is compatible with any medication you give him.    Keep his water really, really clean and treat early.|`|qUcCWuT4aa	all three of my goldfish had it and i only saved one of them:(  but no i dont think it looks like your betta has fin rot  ohh and i would cut down on the pellets|`|ssHzAVlwaa	It is definetly fin rot, Your sister wasn't changing the water as often as she should have. Regardless of the size of the tank, if you don't have a filter on it, you need to clean it more often. The fish has been sitting in its own waste and is now sick from it. you can use this stuff called quik cure. it is at most pet stores. it is pretty cheap. it turns the water blue. This is why when you see bettas on sale in some stores, they are sitting in blue water, so they don't get sick from their waste. Help the fish soon!! oh yeah... and thats way too many pellets!|`|H9Nvo2gxaa	get a heater for him. he could have a little fin rot, buy jungle fungus clear|`|adPO2SVraa	very nice looking betta, it looks like he does, maybe a bit ragged too, but right now its early which is the best time to treat him|`|wmVBNzyoaa	yahhhh i think soo|`|bDPVRtCNaa	It's difficult to tell from the angle, but he doesn't appear to have fin rot to me.    Make sure that he is now given weekly water changes of about 25%, and an aquarium heater.|`|NLKVrdIKaa	It looks like something is wrong with his dorsal fin but it's hard to tell from the angle of the picture.I would start treatment.
HiqdNysdaa	i live in MA also!!!!!!  they are about 15-20$    i live in burlington:)|`|8DKNAn0iaa	Canada   10-20 usually 15$ at pet cetera|`|va8xvhthaa	I live in California.  It is usually $8-$9.
aDeDOmxBaa	As far as i am aware, the dwarf hamster species can interbreed. You may find she is attacking him so that he doesnt try to mate with her although 6 and 8 weeks is maybe a little too early for this.    I used to have two dwarf hamsters of the same sex and species in one tank that got along fine and the same again in another tank that hated eachother so had to be split up. If they are different species, this is the most likely reason that the hamsters will not tolerate eachother. Hamsters can be nastly little things. Again, once i had two female Roberovski hamsters together - sisters and they got on fine until one day one of them was left headless! Sometimes you get a placid one other times you get a vicious one, you have to look at the individuals and take judgement. Even 'sociable' hamsters will take to living on their own if it means that they dotn get continuously picked on.    My honest opinion is if they do not get along in a week or so then you HAVE to separate them. You cannot train animals like this to tolerate eachother, they are not like dogs who respond to behavioural training. I know this isnt the answer you were after but you may find its the only one or one may kill the other eventually.    Let me know how you get on,    Gem x    No worries Logan!|`|NnYB9eXiaa	Um, first off, there's no such thing as a "Hungarian Dwarf" hamster.     [Edit - They're actually a Russian dwarf species know as "Winter White."] I'm not sure why you insist on calling it a Hungarian as no breeder I've ever met in all my time working with hamsters (13 years) has EVER called one that.  They are Winter White Russian Dwarf (Species P. sungorus) hamsters.  I had to do some major searching to even try to figure out what hamster you were referring to - they're a completely different genus than the Chinese hamster species as well]    Here are ALL the known species of hamsters:    Subfamily Cricetinae        * Genus Allocricetulus            o Species A. curtatus - Mongolian Hamster            o Species A. eversmanni - Kazakh Hamster, also called Eversmann's Hamster      * Genus Cansumys            o Species C. canus - Gansu Hamster      * Genus Cricetulus            o Species C. alticola - Ladak Hamster            o Species C. barabensis, including "C. pseudogriseus" and "C. obscurus" - Chinese Striped Hamster, also called Chinese Hamster; Striped Dwarf Hamster            o Species C. griseus - Chinese (Dwarf) Hamster, also called Rat Hamster            o Species C. kamensis - Tibetan Hamster            o Species C. longicaudatus - Long-tailed Hamster            o Species C. migratorius - Armenian Hamster, also called Migratory Grey Hamster; Grey Hamster; Grey Dwarf Hamster; Migratory Hamster            o Species C. sokolovi - Sokolov's Hamster      * Genus Cricetus            o Species C. cricetus - European Hamster, also called Common Hamster or Black-Bellied Field Hamster      * Genus Mesocricetus - Golden Hamsters            o Species M. auratus - Syrian Hamster, also called the Golden Hamster or "Teddy Bear" hamster            o Species M. brandti - Turkish hamster, also called Brandt's Hamster; Azerbaijani Hamster            o Species M. newtoni - Romanian Hamster            o Species M. raddei - Ciscaucasian Hamster      * Genus Phodopus - Dwarf Hamsters            o Species P. campbelli - Campbell's Russian Dwarf Hamster            o Species P. roborovskii - Roborovski Hamster, the smallest and fastest of the hamster species            o Species P. sungorus - Winter White Russian Dwarf Hamster       * Genus Tscherskia            o Species T. triton - Greater Long-tailed Hamster, also called Korean Hamster      Second - You're right about the interbreeding except for 2 types - the only dwarf species that can interbreed are Cambpells and Winter Whites [Your "Hungarian] - and the results are generally horrifying.    Third - I'd avoid giving advice on hamsters if you don't even know about introducing or housing hamsters together.     Fourth - females are very territorial and although some dwarf species can co-habitate, mixing two breeds (and you don't actually know what one is commonly known as) and sexes is just asking for something terrible to happen. Get a second cage NOW.  Telling us that "saying, don't put them in the same cage is not what im asking about ok." is ridiculous.  You can't possibly say that a "Hungarian [Winter White]" doesn't like to share because it's just not true!  Winter Whites are VERY social, but they're a different Genus than Chinese hamsters!  You just can't always cage 2 hamsters together.     End of story.    The rule here is to give advice when you KNOW of what you speak.   Your other posts to "educate" people without them asking for help are interesting, but perhaps you should do more research before advising people :)    Daisy
Nb5AXK2Taa	I would play it safe and get an air pump with some tube and a bubble diffuser.|`|sSSpRtD2aa	they are generally made of plaster that breaks down slowly in waterand release bubbles trapped within them. i wouldnt recomend them they can be kinda messy . get a air pump if you can they are reasonable as far as $ but if you need something more quiet they can cost a we bit more|`|OdDbR4Psaa	I used them once, the bubbles only lasted about 3 days. Supposedly, "Those air bubbles will disappear, dissolving into the water. But Oxygen Stone continues to produce oxygen for the period of about one month." But don't always believe the package, I recommend a pump - saves money, time and energy in the long run.|`|wLbXsvAKaa	I have heard of people useing those, but I have never wanted to try them.    I woulg get a air pump at the pet store, its safer. The air pump is around $10 and and and air stone for like 69 cents.    Those stones might use something toxic to fish so I wouldnt use them.|`|jzTr87Ftaa	I wouldn't use those oxygen stones anymore.  All you really need is something to agitate the surface of the water, so that oxygen will diffuse through the surface.  An air pump and a cheap air-stone would be the simplest way to go.
8NSh1D4Maa	If the skin appears healthy, keep an eye on it is all and make sure it's growing back in well.  I've encountered a few rabbits that shed in large patches at certain times of the year, almost down to bare skin.  Especially with you brushing, that can sometimes remove it faster than it would naturally fall out, leaving him with a temporary bald spot.  If the skin looks red and irritated, has sores, is flaky, or the hair does not begin to grow back soon, I'd have a vet check him over.  For now, though, just observe and don't worry overly much about it.|`|nPuZVGFRaa	It is a HE right?  Because sometimes females start to loose hair before they have baby's.
FQmZLqMdaa	Complain verbally, over the phone & in writing.  Contact a solicitor & explain.  Get a vet to do an autopsy it sounds like the dog was seriously sick before it arrived.  You should be entitled to a 7 day guarantee therefore a refund should be given.  If you paid by credit card perhaps you are insured to cover the loss of your item.    You know now why you should never buy a dog from a petstore but a back yard breeder is probably involved somewhere down the line.|`|ba86e3c1dafe29cda3bf9356d0bbeec1aa	Yikes.  Sorry to hear about your puppy.  Can you share what the circumstances were around the dogs death?  If the dog was clearly unhealthy at the pet store that is one thing.  If there was a tragic accident, that's another.    It's not that uncommon for puppies from pet stores to get kennel cough after coming home.  Did you have a vet picked out (or even better, did you already see them)?|`|uZDJOv3maa	thats soooooooooo mean! never buy from a pet store!|`|rfttFZjIaa	Besides giving you the advice not to buy from a pet shop, you should also know that certain states have a "Puppy Lemon Law" and you should look it up and inform yourself about your rights. For example, in CA, there is an implied warranty that the puppy is healthy and fit for purchase. It's a guarantee that you puppy will at least make it through the first 15 days and not fall ill due to some preexisting illness. Look into it.    Because I live in CA included our Puppy Lemon Law (see link), but you should definitely inquire about the law applicable to your state.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	Just going by your comments about the dog, you should never own another animal.|`|IVjspiStaa	Because you lost your receipt...  opps you can't say your dog ate it.|`|p3vjvzRPaa	Buying a dog from a pet shop is never a good idea.    A dog will be your companion for a decade or more. It's worth taking the time to find a good breeder.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	That will teach you won't it?|`|jxRiH2e9aa	And this is why you never buy from a pet store. =/  They are just in it for the money, not the quality of the dog.|`|1Q4GTAwdaa	How did it die?    Was there something wrong with the dog or did it run out in front of a car?    If there was a problem with the dog, then you need to make a serious complaint.  If the store was part of a chain, then find the head office and complain to them.  If all that fails, then contact a solicitor.    If the dog died by a means that could have been avoided by you, then you have no chance.  You will have to wear it.    As for the dogs remains, is entirely up to you.  Bury it in the backyard, pet cremation etc...    And next time, go to a proper breeder.  Don't buy from a store.|`|gpJ3RHbyaa	NEVER BUY A DOG FROM A PET STORE.    Live and Learn.|`|xvwyv7Gdaa	if its a legitimate pet shop they should refund your money or give you a refund.  almost all pups that come from pet shops are sick.  next time you should rescue a dog. (its a lot cheaper too)|`|QdQcAHqaaa	Pet stores buy their puppies from puppy mills, which often breed unhealthy dogs.  If pet stores cared about their customers, they wouldn't be doing this practice in the first place.  The best thing you can do is to learn your lesson about buying dogs from pet stores. Also, if your dog is already swelling, it means the bacteria are feeding on the dead flesh, which creates gas. So, if you don't bury your dog soon, it could potentially explode.|`|xJgILr5faa	Take it back make a big seen if they say the same thing i am not taking it back and i will be here the next day and the next day and bring some loud mouth friends of mine let them call the cops tell them you story  get you money and find a good breeder|`|csvGd6DHaa	thank so for the 2 points.hahahahahaha|`|b5ecvoTnaa	you probably fell for a scam. that's really too bad.

Ar80Ri8eaa	well it's not a manly dog.. but it's not too girly so long as you're not putting it in a tutu or something.|`|xJgILr5faa	Do you like ----------How CUTE IT IS?---------------if so ,girly is what you should get and maybe some new shoes|`|Eug52iQDaa	There does tend to be a stereotype that small dogs are 'girly' dogs.  That said, the dog will be a product of how it is raised.  If you intend to raise a little ill-mannered ankle-biter, I'm sorry.  If, however, you intend to raise a well-socialized small dog that greets people properly and has manners, then you have done the dog justice.  You now have a dog that you, and everyone else, can respect.      My favorite saying is that only a 'real, secure' man can own a small dog.  :)|`|zyX502COaa	I kinda think so, Imean i am too.I guess people kinda think so cuz u can carry them in ur purses.hahahaha|`|hRikwc00aa	I don't think any dog is "girly" or "manly". I think that if a Chihuahua is the best dog for you, get it and don't mind anyone else.|`|v9oy3w2Iaa	Kinda I think they are. Like you really see girl stars wering Chihuahuas. And boys not so much|`|AaXl3vcCaa	no but if you are carrying it around in your purse with a sweater  and boots on they will think that|`|c8uI3n0Raa	I don't think so. I've seen grown men content with a fat little chihuahua.  Like that video on youtube with the doberman and the fat little black and white chihuahua.  They're just portrayed that way cause celebs like Paris and Britney haul the poor things in glittery bags, and dress them to death, especially the runts, aka 'teacups.'|`|fZ2NOOZ5aa	Well, not really. Just as long as the owner doesnt act femine or walk it on a pink leash or carry it in a handbag or anything like I think it'd be fine.    (If you recall the main character in Transformers has a Chihuahua & he didnt come off as girly to me)|`|q7z7Ni3Daa	Yes, I'd say most people consider it a girly dog. Think of it this way. Imagine a chihuahua and picture its owner. Do you automatically picture a girl or a guy? On the other hand, one reason for this is that so many owners dress their little chihuahuas up in pink doggie outfits and bows (Think Paris Hilton).   If you really want a chihuahua, buy one and put a black leather spike collar on it (not the one that hurts dogs, just a design). Maybe a little Harley vest (yes they sell those =). Then it won't be a girly dog at all!    Enjoy your dog!|`|5FVyVS9vaa	Everyone is different. I love all animals. I have always had a dog growing up. The reason that I would like a bigger dog is what I do with the dog. I like to hunt and fish and play a little bit rough. A lab would be the kind of a dog that I would want. A chihuahua would not be a happy dog living with me. He might with you, but that does not make him a girly dog by any means. I guess size makes a difference with me. I need a big dog. I look at it this way, as long as you are happy with your choice, it makes no difference what others think. Whatever you do, when you get him or her just give it a lot of love and attention and you will get back twice as much as you give.

NnYB9eXiaa	Hi :)    First big deep breath cause dwarf hamsters - all 4 pet species, are *genetically immune* to wet tail :)  I know you figured that out but there are going to be others reading this that may not know that!    I wouldn't worry, hamsters are like people and um, everybody poops and they all do it differently, lol.    Are you giving them any fresh foods?  You need to avoid all fruits and sweet veggies (like sweet potatoes, fresh peas, etc) along with any sweet treats like yogurt drops and honey sticks with dwarfs.  They're prone to diabetes - plus their little bodies can't handle the extra sugar.    I don't think he's dehydrated, he'd have sunken in eyes and his skin would be sorta loose - you'd notice that and it would scare you.    If you could please message me and let me know what they're eating, I can probably help you get to the root of the problem :)    I'm not a vet, I don't play one on TV, but I am a county and vet supported small animal rescue and I specialize in dwarf hamsters :)    Daisy|`|f1fd9f1cf1a58e760d7ffd75daa60953aa	wet tail take that one to the vet for med in his water|`|lhmsAlQuaa	O NO he has wet TAIL get some medicine for it NOW if not it will DIE of dehydration Wet Tail is diarya and this is bad|`|owko7Jczaa	It has wet tail, a very common and serious sickness in hamsters.  You should run to the nearest pet store and get some DriTail. And if it has been like this for a couple of days there is a chance that you will not be able to save it. Sorry. You could also try the vet.  Hope everything turns out okay.|`|va8xvhthaa	Oh no!!!! WET TAIL!!!!!!!!!!!! Hurry up and save that hamster! Hamsters can die within 72 hours of having wet tail!!!! Go to the vet!!!!!!!!!! Save this tiny hamster!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Believe me, it is wet tail. Wet tail is very dangerous.
IMPvzBk1aa	Another way to do it is to get your education in something that enhances what you'll be doing, but that can earn you a good income so you won't be reliant on the horse business to get by.  For example, study nursing.  A BSN will only take you 4 years to complete and will qualify you to function in multiple aspects of the nursing field, and pay is excellent.  The projected shortages assure that you will be able to get a job just about anywhere in the free world and earn a living.  The hours you work are flexible, and not dependent on a 9 to 5 business workweek, which would accommodate your need to be there for the horses. The courses you take will give you an extensive background in the sciences, and prepare you with knowledge of subjects like anatomy, physiology, pathophysiology, epidemiology, microbiology, pharmacology, nutrition, and others that will prove invaluable in managing the horses.  You will also learn practical skills like medication administration, inserting catheters, bandaging, suturing, wound care, and so forth that are virtually the same for horses as they are for humans.  You will have a certain number of elective coursework hours to fill.  I would also take a few basic business courses since boarding horses is a business, and requires business management skills.  In the meantime learn as much as you can by working in stables, taking lessons, and observing or working with trainers in the equine industry.  You can always then study equine sciences part time while already earning a good living and pursuing your dream.    The thing is, the economy is in the dumpster and it isn't looking like that will change anytime soon.  The entire equine industry will be affected by that, and putting all your eggs into the equine studies basket could leave you with an education that won't be able to earn you a living.

I should give you a fair warning though, don't let that be your only job. Period.

Your dream is a great possibility and can happen, but you need another day-time job.

If you're looking for education, study equine nutrition, apprentice with good trainers (no parelli... giving a horse a carrot to distract him from biting you is NOT a training method), and take some courses in horse health and first aid.
3wJGXfkKaa	My vet told me that when I changed from front line to Advantage that I needed to wait closer to time of giving them another dose because that stuff gets into there blood streams and too much of him can really hurt them.  We had fleas that were horrible they gave me some pills to give the dog that would kill existing fleas but it only last 24 hours so you have to give them one a day I did that for a couple of days then I just went and bought some adam's flea and tick shampoo and bathed my dog in it and the fleas were dead in like 2 or 3 min plus my dog was clean it don't smell the greatest in the world but nothing works better than that stuff trust me.|`|DqUi0xPhaa	I woudl go to the vet and get a capstar pill...kills fleas in 1 hour lasts 24 hours....Personally I would still use the advantage...call the 800 number on box...|`|AA10988479	some of the flea stuff says to wait 24 hours after a bath
MZ8uqhNEaa	1. How should I have the cats meet?  This will take time, you can't just bring a female (or any cat) into a males territory and expect them to get along. You need to explain this to your friend, so he won't be surprised when they start hissing.     They will probably hiss no matter what, so just let them hiss and sniff each other, she is fixed, is the male cat? If not, this introduction, will not work. If he is, then you can go on. :)     When you take the cat over, have them have a whole room to herself, and ask him if he could keep the cat for about 4 days. Please. You can't just expect a cat to like another cat, especially two adult cats. I'm sorry, but this is the absolute --->LEAST    Bring her in a cat carrier. Put her in the room, and close the door, you can do whatever you want, just don't bother her, please.   Have your friend scoop out her own litter box (bring the one she has over), or you could do it. Give her water and food. For the first two days, just let the cats meet through the closed door.     On the third day, crack the door open, don't let the cats fully meet, just let the touch noses, and see each other. They can --->NOT    Then, on the fourth day, fully open the door. With complete supervision from your friends mom, your friend, and you, let the cats meet. If they start lunge at each other --->IMMEDIATELY    (Sorry if I sounded rude, I really wasn't trying too, sorry.)    2. If they seem to get along, and they are going to keep the cat, how long will it take for my cat to get adjusted there and get back to her normal self?  Probably about 2-3 weeks. One, there is another strange cat in the house. Two, because it is a new house. Three, because she is not with you.      3. My friend's cat is a boy and mine is a girl, will that make them get along better or worst?  Better! This is very good. Tom cats (males) fight with other toms. So if it is a female, this will help because the female is not threatening, so the female is not threatened. :)      4. If they do end up keeping her, should they keep her in a confined room until she adjusts?  For 4 days, so she can get used to the other cat, and see if it works to have her there.     Then, if they can keep her, they should keep her in a confined room for about 3 days, and then put the tom in her room, and let her roam. Then put them back for another 3 days, and repeat the process for about 2 weeks.    After two weeks, it is Ok to let her roam with the tom, with supervision. After a month without fighting, they won't need to be supervised. They may have some tiffs, but they should be okay.      5. So how do we explain that it will take some time before she gets back to normal because she has been though a lot and she is not a dog who you can drop at a person's house and not be traumatized?  Explain what happened with your grandparents house. Tell them that she just needs time to adjust and she should be fine. All you have to do is be patient. Plus, you could go over there a lot, and check on her, she won't be alone.      I hope I helped! Good luck, and I think it is wonderful what you are doing for this cat!      P.S. Sorry if I sounded rude, I wasn't trying to. Also, sorry this is so long! :)|`|IzRk1mZQaa	I think you should go ahead and give the cat to the ASPCA or the Humane Society.  Every person who wants to adopt has a questionaire to answer, has to give vet information, plus your cat will be learning to socialize with other cats.  Let someone come in and fall in love with your cat and give her the home she deserves.  I know it;s a hard decision, but not all shelters are bad, and its better for the cat in the long run to find a life long home.|`|HnMhBSVqaa	you should get a cheap baby gate and put one of the cats on one side and one on the other. see how they act and the different gender will help. also its okay for her to go to a shelter i go to a shelter almost every month and its awesome there people come in  adopt cats and dogs all the time. maybe it was what kind of smell in the house but m- ost likely it was that she does not like people besides you that may be a problem but im sure it will work out.  so i hope it will work out ; )|`|zguucR8yaa	You can't tell from one meeting if two cats will get along. What your friend would need to do, if he's willing, is keep your cat at his house for about 2 weeks. The first week, your cat should be confined to one room, and only be allowed to smell his cat from underneath the door. This way, they get used to each other's smell. Then, open the door, let them see and sniff each other under supervised visits. After a few days of this, let your cat have free run of the house and then see how they get along.  Hope your kitty gets a home!|`|AA12398420	Clarice is right...that would be the way to introduce them to each other. Your friend needs to understand unless it is a kitten that they may not get along at all at first and needs time to adjust.  One way that will speed up the process is to get a dishtowel and wipe your kitty from head to tail with it and put the rag under the food dish of his cat. That way when he eats he will smell her scent and get used to her faster. And since it is connected to food he will have a good feeling about her.  When you do bring her over make sure to keep her in the carrier and do not let her out. His cat needs to see and smell her in the carrier and if there is no hissing or bad reaction then you can let her out. Sometimes they do get along, but you never know.
rVnTnuU1aa	Ferrets! These little woozels are great pets. Their personalities are great and some of the things they do just crack me up. I would recommend a ferret that is descent-ed. I have three and they have no smell. But can begin to smell a bit gamy if there bedding is not washed at least once a week. Hamsters and Guinea pigs really don't have much of a personality to me. I have one albino that sleeps with me in bed like a baby. Shes so chunky and cute. I have a dark sable ferret that is addicted to duck soup and follows me around the house until her soup is made. My albino ferret we taught how to play hide and seek to. Their so cute!|`|qGy9fR7xaa	I think you should go for a guinea pig.

Moreover, they are odourless even for delicate noses. And it is just this undemanding nature that has made of the dwarf hamsters, even more so of the golden hamsters, a most popular "toy" for children. It must, however, be emphasized that dwarf hamsters are of limited suitability for small children. It's true they may be more active during the day than the golden hamster, but they, too don't want to be woken up in the daytime just to be stroken. Furthermore, dwarf hamsters are such tiny animals that only older children dispose of the necessary fine-motor capacity to stroke these little fellows without running the risk of crushing them to death.     Social behaviour   Hungarian dwarf hamsters are shy animals by nature who over and over again scrutinize the environment closely from their hiding place to be sure that the coast is clear. They go and get their feed  la hamster, stuff it into their cheek pouches and bring it home to safety. This way of life of a "grabber" always nearest to himself has, of course, a solitary character. He doesn't want to share, but just wants to look for himself. He doesn't enjoy company. Dwarf hamsters are, however, much easier to get on with fellow species than the golden hamsters. When two unfamiliar animals meet, they first go around one another several times, sniff at each other and then continue to go peacefully their own way. This allows the pet owners to keep several peaceable nest brothers and sisters together.     Behavioural disturbances   The blowing up of the legendary chubby cheeks is a display pattern and not a behaviour disorder. Neglect, keeping the animals in ways not appropriate to their species, wrong feeding, diseases, irritation through noise and touching the animal the wrong way promote the tendency to bite and to cannibalism. Because of the latter it is important that the dams are not disturbed the first week after giving birth and the cubs should under no circumstances be touched. Otherwise it can happen that completely distraught mothers eat their cubs!    Man-Animal communication   The first step to be able to communicate is the effort to get to know as much as possible about the life of the dwarf hamsters in the open countryside. This will help to soon be able to interpret body posture, behaviour patterns, vocalization. For instance one will detect that animals with put up bottom and erected tail signal their humility. Or that they stand up straight and take up a threatening position with blown up chubby cheeks. If the pet owner feeds the dwarf hamster with a calm hand, the animal will come to trust him and become tame. He then climbs on his hand and later on the whole person with familiar smell.     Animals "talk" to their fellow species by body posture, position of the tail, facial expression, vocalization and many more. If the human being has the position of companion and substitute for fellow species, then he must try to make up a little bit for the big deficit. The easiest way to do this is to talk calmly to his pets. Just the way he would talk with other human beings. Animals are extremely capable of learning and understand very quickly what words, the tone of voice and gestures want to say.   Undesirable behaviour   With his sharp teeth the dwarf hamster can cause considerable damage. He should only be allowed to have free run in the apartment when he really has become tame and when he does not seek refuge anymore from men. He will try everywhere to gather padding for his little house and put it in his chubby cheeks: Carpet fibres, pieces of wallpaper and many more. The run-out yard is indeed very risky for the animal (accidents!). It is far better to have a large enclosure.     Mood barometer   DThe body posture of the dwarf hamster tells a lot about his state of health and his mental state. When he eats and sniffs curiously and when he assiduously cleans his pelage, then he feels well and lively. When he puts his ears back, this can mean a lot: Fear, tiredness, bad mood, aggression. When he stands up straight and blows up his chubby cheeks, then he wants to threaten and impress ennemies (also the human hand) and possibly put hem to flight. This is the time when one must leave him in peace, because otherwise he might bite. If the dwarf hamster jumps in the air, then he certainly is in a good mood and high-spirited. If the animal flinches or cleans himself suddenly and persistently, he he got a fright from something. It is important then to leave him in peace.    Psychology of animals   A nocturnal animal and active also in the twilight who feels well above all in caves and in the security of a store cupboard filled to bursting, is everything else than a cuddly toy. If the dwarf hamster is frightened and shy,|`|s8Cbg73baa	Ok, when guinea pigs poop, it is horrible!!!!! the smell is sickening! Hamsters are really cute.

ESWdyM6Haa	From personal experience I can tell you that an adult cat can tolerate and train a puppy to act right but a it just doesn't work the other way around...|`|Vhq3GURQaa	I have 2 dogs and 1 cat. They get along famously. My 2 year old male dog is best buds with the 5 year old female cat. They groom each other, play tag and wrestle. The one dog was about 8 when kitty came. We introduced them slowly. The first night, kitty stayed in a locked room with everything she needed. I wanted to make sure they had time to adjust before I slept (possibly missing something). Then we brought a puppy home. All is well.|`|JsBb732Maa	My JRT will kill a cat if he had a chance, but he's never been around any as my pet. Be careful when you introduce them, have the dog on a leash. Maybe crate the cats so he can see them, smell them but not bite them. He might not dislike them at all but with a terrier it's very hard to guess because they are hunting dogs.|`|zhk8o514aa	It all depends on the personalty of the dog.

There will be some adjustment periods, but just make sure that the cats have a place they can get away to where the dog can't get to them and make sure that they aren't left alone unsupervised until the transition is complete and you are certain they will get along without you there.|`|fFtBqFB6aa	Those cats will take care of themselves. We recently got a Boston and my cat was m.i.a. for about a month (she just didn't come out of the bedroom) but she's started to come around the dog more and she won't put up with too much playing around from him. She chases after him.|`|giCUEYsJaa	Anything is possible.    However, Terriers were bred to hunt varmints such as rats.  And unfortunately they're instinctual drive is inane and they can't control themselves to not go after cats.    I know, I have owned terriers for 30+ years.  But of course there is the off chance your new little cutie was raised with cats, and things would work out.    Don't worry about your cat being chewed up by your terrier.  In the dog and cat world, the cat will always win out.     You no doubt will have a few weeks of cat/dog 'fights', but    DO NOT INTERVENE.    You could get bit by either!

FQmZLqMdaa	Sounds as if he is like most Bassets & Beagles - very very stubborn.  Best plan :-    1.  Escape to the bathroom & put the water/soap in the bath.  2.  Get his favourite toy & treats & put them in your pocket.  3.  Get dog to follow his treats etc., making sure that he goes through the doors before you & close them behind you.  4.  Once you get him in the Bathroom. Close the door.  If he howls ignore him.  5.  If he cannot escape you will get done much quicker & he may eventually like baths.    I had this problem for 16 year with my Basset Hound her problem was that as a small puppy she fell into an icy fishpond & caught pneumonia therefore baths were stressful.  After a couple of years we gave up with the bath thing & she stopped rolling in mud & cow poop as we wandered over the fields.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Maybe treats. Get him used to going in there without the dreaded bath.    I get my guys bath towels out and tell one of them to get in the tub. He will get up slowly, hang his head, let out this long sigh and get in the tub. I get him finished  Then the next one will play like he is still asleep, slowly he will do the same thing.   It like they are moving in slow motion, until after the bath, then they go into hyper drive.|`|2284892d397da9e7d9297a73b92bd630aa	So sorry about the problems, I am really fortunate to have a pup who loves water. I agree with the groomer, if it's only twice a year I'd let someone else deal with the hassle and pay them. My cousin used to bathe my collie at her grooming shop and it was nice that they had leash restraints (not sure what to call them) where the dog was tethered to wall so it couldn't run away while they bathed. Of course this too may be stressful but there will be less chance for injury. If you really want to do it yourself, check for a self-serve dog wash in your town. They have giant stalls and you get all the supplies you need in the price, it's like a doggie car wash. Take it slow, try to make it fun, lots of treats and head scratches!|`|Mnkuxy8yaa	Boy can I relate to your question......    I had a talk with my vet...she prescribed valium...our dog gets 1/2 a pill 20 minutes before her bath, it keeps her calm enough that I don't have any trouble with her.    The other thing is to try behavior modification....try calling him into the bathroom and giving him a treat.  Then walk away...once he gets used to the idea of getting a treat when he comes into the bathroom, start standing in the bathtub...when you can get him into the bathroom, and in the tub without trouble, you might find it easier to get him to take a bath.  Good luck...I need to bath mine this weekend....and am not looking forward to it.|`|0a07f2e5a084ebc8ae39f790612c5390aa	For one you need to bathe him more than twice a year get him used to doing it.. Take him to a groomer and have them do it get him used to one person bathing him and he might be okay.. He may not be comfortable with the way you bathe him.. And alot of times dogs can get over on there owners if they act like they dont want to do something the owner stops and doesnt go through with it.. Take him to a groomer that way he will understand hes going to get it done either way
8e4e5525d4c996bd34b95f4a6c4ef68daa	i have tried what emo kid said to do with the pee/poo in the face.  yea...it doesn't work.    I think I know what is going on. My cat Bubby (who is neutred) is a VERY VERY VERY JEALOUS AND TERRITORIAL CAT. He does not like any other cats. At all. Point blank. I have a cat, Precious (who is a boy) and I bring him in to eat/play with. He is not neurted, only because he is an outside WILD cat and yea....he wouldn't like me too much after that. But anyway, when I bring him inside or if he just sees him he gets pissed at me and sprays. Lately it's been on my laundry basket and so I have been closing my door when I'm not in there. He also is scared to go to the litter box because to get there he has to go past our german shepard (who is in her cage because it's either too cold/too hold/etc.) and he is deathly afraid. so sometimes he is just doing it to do it. he never poo's around the house tho, thats the funny thing lol. anyway, my suggestion is just try to keep the territorial males from seeing each other? my kitty Leo doesn't like my kitty (and his son) Precious [who i mentioned earlier] and so he tries to fight him but I normally stop him.  But Bubby is insanely jealous and he sprays because he is being territorial. I hope this helps, although there is no real solution. Just gotta keep doin what your doing.|`|luVUhBPRaa	I would suggest you would go to the vet and say look, my cats are having problems with their constant urine problem. If you have anything that they could take, please give it to me.    If they don't give anything to you, just whenever you find pee / poop in the house, go find out whichever cat did it ( i would suggest this by picking the one that circles around you ) and rub their face in it.  Trust me. If it worked for me it must work for you.    Good Luck! :-)
gpJ3RHbyaa	HIS HOUSE, HIS RULES.    You want a MUTT.  They are real, yes, but THOSE NAMES ARE MADE UP.     GET A STUFFED ANIMAL.|`|afPzgCSHaa	I agree with bob.|`|aCqSF87Raa	I could be really sarcastic right now, but i won't because i'm just plain tired of ignorance.... and stupidity..... and spoilt children.....     Yes there are such things as "yorkie poos" and "malti poos" - they're also called "mutts." They are no "mythical" new breed or anything special. There are dozens of them in shelters, along with other "designer" breeds with cutesy names.     However they are not a recognized breed of dog by ANY reputable organization, and will never be one because they do not breed true - you cannot predict what every pup will look like or be like; there is no "breed standard." In addition, people who "create" these dogs do so for profit or fun: they do not breed for health or temperament, which means no health testing or guarantees against painful and deadly genetic conditions/diseases.    With that in mind....    If mom and dad cannot talk it over and come to some sort of agreement about a dog, then now is not the right time for your family to have a dog. Period. They are the ones that work eight hour or more shifts to pay the bills on the house (which can total up to or over $1,500 a month.) They put money away for YOUR college savings. They pay for YOUR food, school supplies, clothes, etc.    With THAT in mind; Dogs are expensive. Starting fees can total $500 not including the dog (which, adopted would be another hundred or so and bought from a Back Yard Greeder would be another thousand.) Monthly fees are about $150, more if you need professional grooming every few months. Emergency fees can run over a thousand.    They're also probably worried about your interest - or lack of interest once the novelty has worn off. They don't want to be stuck doing the dirty work - brushing, cleaning up after, scheduling vet/grooming fees, etc. And unless you religiuosly do your chores, how would they know you are able to do everything and anything for a dog?    So grow up, get a job. Finish school and get your own place. Go to college. Then think about getting a dog.|`|pc7ZjexJaa	yay bob    you can wait.

Let him know that he will be responsible. Promise that you will feed him, water him, walk him, love him, etc. Before you ask him, maybe take on a little more responsible at home so he says that you are capable of having a dog. My dad was against having me get a dog because he was afraid that it would go to the bathroom all over the house. I convinced him that I would work really hard on potty training and clean up any messes that happened (if that is one of his concerns). Is there anything that you do that gets on his nerves? If so, try not to do that for a while so he will be more open to give you a dog. BE SURE NOT TO WHINE OR BEG THOUGH!! this will make him think that you are immature and not mature enough to take care of a dog! good luck and I hope you get your puppy!|`|rCgYepfXaa	I had the exact same problem three months ago. The first thing you need to do is research about the type of dog you want and get some pictures of it to make a presentation for your parents. I wrote a 3 page letter saying why i want a dog, how i would take care of it and what i could help pay for. Once you do all that you then need to write a list of all the things you could do 4 the dog (i.e. wash it, feed it, brush it, walk it ect.....) and a list of all the things you would need help with. Then present it all to your parents and tell them to give some time and think about it, they dont need to tell you now. Next, Start doing things around the house when your not asked to. Always keep your room cleaned and pick up after yourself. You should go on craigslist.com and look at some of the animals they are selling. You might want to look for an animal that is an adult (a year old) and already potty trained. Next, raise money. Maybe you can do something around the neighborhood and tell your neighbors its to help save a dog (if your getting it from the shelter) Never give up. If nothing then you can always raise money to help a dog in need!
pc7ZjexJaa	submissive peeing|`|KxjUim7yaa	It sounds like what is called " submissive urination." Just to rule out a bladder infection, have the vet check him.|`|uZDJOv3maa	maybe he is a little scared|`|ed383e57bd62ba920b6a3cb3d5cab549aa	could be that he is just really excited to be by you. My daughter's yorkie did this every time he was excited
ldaSfLvFaa	Sometimes they can get urinary tract infections. The common signs are frequent urination,thirst,lethargic movements. It is important to have her taken to the vet and checked. There really isnt anything that you can do to make the situation better. You are already doing that.|`|rmxqoXrkaa	Sounds like diabetes, symptoms of diabetes are in fact drinking excessive amounts of water, and urination frequently. Luckily diabetes is very treatable, I suggest you make an appointment with your vet|`|3giaPYe8aa	She needs to be seen by a Vet.  Either she has an UTI or possibly is a Diabetic.  While you there, ask the Tech of express her anal glands.  That's the probable reason for "butt surfing."|`|NLKVrdIKaa	Get this dog to a vet as soon as possible!|`|C1eHfhrHaa	Have her checked for a UTI or diabetes.|`|Mnkuxy8yaa	take her to the vet......  it could be any number of things that only a vet can treat.|`|p3vjvzRPaa	It doesn't sound like someting you should just 'wait and see' about.    I would take her to the vet.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Symptoms can point to several things. A UTI or diabetes comes to my mind. You need to see the vet. Also if possible get a urine sample in a clean container.|`|FQmZLqMdaa	Take her to the vet, she could have a kidney infection or something worse.  If she is acting strange she is trying to tell you something.|`|bQ9LJcEoaa	Take her to the doc. and get it checked out!|`|QeaGNzo8aa	Take her to the vet and give her constant care. if the vet cant find anything wrong than maybe it is just a bug. Just be very careful with her and god bless you.
IzRk1mZQaa	you really need to take this animal to a vet.  if you can't afford a vet, please sign it over to the Humane Society or ASPCA.    Please don't try to set the leg yourself, if you don't know how then please don't experiment on this kitty.  Just put a leash around his neck, pick him up, and please go.|`|fBMSIlSIaa	Take him to the vet ASAP! A cat with a broken bone needs care. Cats will heal over months, but do you really want to make it wait that long with pain when you could take it to the vet and they can fix it?|`|2DuEUIDkaa	Take him to the vet just to be sure he's okay. If his leg his broken, your doctor will probably tell you to take it to an animal hospital. Also you can also just hold him in your car, or get someone else to.|`|HrcVjP1jaa	Why not take it to the vet just to be safe?|`|ak9DrBSwaa	Going to the vet is necessary.|`|3WzGf8tJaa	take it to a vet.   put it in its crate    otherwise the bone might have to be rebroken to set it correctly.  Or it is heals  improperly, it will give your cat pain and/or trouble the rest of its life.|`|tDKkojXHaa	I suggest take him to the vet and if its kind of hard to get him in his crate try playing with him in a way that he will get inside the crate or just put him a snack inside. If its broken it could get worse.   Good luck.|`|OwfK8vvgaa	if the cage you have comes apart - meaning the top separates from the bottom, take it apart and lay the kitty into the cage and then put it back together while kitty is in it, then get kitty into the vet as soon as possible, even if it hasn't broken its leg, you still need to get it checked out to make sure it is ok.  Cats don't know how to heal themselves when it comes to broken limbs, they need every bit as much help as humans do.|`|tD7iqFSFaa	If you cant get the cat to a vet the rspca are always very helpful i would recommend ringing them and asking for advice.  the cats health comes first. good luck.|`|IpwsYe2kaa	If you can't get him in a cage then gently carry him in there in your arms and just put a leash around his neck just in case. But along with healing themselves can also come helaing himself wrong, You should definitely have the vet take a look|`|U5IigAByaa	i really think you should take him to the vets. i know cats hate getting in the boxes/carriers but you really must be mentally strong and just do it|`|IGqMSCLjaa	Take him to vet to be safe. It could have been a temporary injury. Observe him and if you see anything that seems wrong take him to vent.|`|AA11457471	If the cat is living in your house now it's not a stray anymore- it's YOUR cat! It's depending on you to take care of it.     I wish cats could heal themselves! Sure would save me a lot in vet bills! (Slap the idiot that told you that!)    If you can't get it in a cage put it in a large pillow case & tie the end shut to take it to the vet. I know it sounds strange but it works just fine.    Good luck!|`|bxlYleZkaa	Yes it is very important to go to the vet. The break may not heal well and there may already be complications. Most cats do not cry when thy are in pain.|`|8Y9EogN0aa	take him to the vet NOW! eventually he'll get in his cage|`|q411DXsFaa	I would defiantly take it to the vet just to be sure its okay. If you can't get there today just comfort it. Maybe try putting some pop sickle sticks around its leg and put a bandage around it so it cant move it. (I did this with my dog once until I could get him to the vet)|`|49RABlM4aa	GET HIM TO THE VET NOW!!! If you even think about overlooking this problem, it will get ten times worse and then the ending will not be happy. He may require surgery, but that's better than losing him.|`|qgepueA6aa	YES!|`|6be65543422b4937c27d1761a2ed50a0aa	Going to the vet is the only way to find out EXACTLY how bad your cat's leg is.  If it's only sprained, that's great.....but, if it's broken, it needs to be "set".  The vet it the best one to determine the extent of his injury......    Get your carrier, and set it ON END in the bathroom (open)!....Don't let the cat SEE it !!  Then, coax your cat out from under the bed ( with a treat ? ), pick him up and take him into the bathroom.  BE SURE to shut the door, before you turn loose.......DON'T turn loose.  Set him gently ( butt first ) DOWN INTO the carrier, and shut the door QUICKLY, before he has a chance to get out!    This is the BEST way to put a cat into a carrier, especially when they don't want to get in........they don't have a choice!!    Hope this helps, and he's ok.......Good luck.|`|Ahd0Zuzlaa	Cats don't know how to heal themselves! You should carefully get him into a carrier that is big enough to hold him and take him to the vet. He may have internal bleeding!|`|VDP3pNCPaa	Cats are not trained medical professionals.  All they can do is to try and heal, and then deal with the problems if the healing did not go well.    You need to find a way of getting him to the vet to be checked out.|`|iIGOi2Idaa	'Cats know how to heal themselves' - where on God's green and verdant Earth did you read that nonsense, the Drunken 3 Year Old's Guide to Cat Care?!    No, cats don't heal themselves. If they did, I wouldn't see so many in my clinic!! Untreated broken legs heal badly and can cause cats to lose the use of that leg, if they don't die from infection.    It may not be a broken leg, but it's certainly something that needs to be looked at - cat's are GREAT at hiding pain, so if it's enough to cause him to limp, it isn't good. He could well have been fighting - if his leg got bitten by another cat, you will see a fantastic swelling with pus oozing from it (an abscess) pop up after a few days.     Get someone to help you catch the cat. Wrap it in a towel if necessary. I'm always happy to pop out and get cats into baskets if people need it, hopefully your vets can also offer this service if no one else can help you - but do get the cat to a vet, somehow. And while he's there, have him neutered if he isn't already - he's not a stray cat anymore, he's yours!! And if he goes outside and isn't neutered, he will be fighting a LOT and making a LOT of poor homeless little kittens.    Chalice    EDIT: Do not attempt to splint the leg, this can do more harm than good.|`|feUxjBbnaa	Get it to the vet now!  Cats can't heal a broken leg themselves.  Cats are known for hiding their pain.  He needs you to do the right thing........take him to the vet ASAP!  This is the exact reason why ALL cats should be INDOORS ONLY.
