My sister told me they make good chew toys because they are crunchy but not to hard to hurt his newly exposed teeth, but he devours them and then licks up all the little pieces.  I don't think they would hurt him, but I read that they could be healthy as well.  I did wonder if you could kind of overdose him on carrots?  He gets 2 to 3 a day as treats in between his meals.

Im in the uk and rescued a 7 year old shih tzu that was so aggressive they were going to put him to sleep   I saw his story on the tv and pleaded with them to let me have him after a long battle i got him   he was the most aggressive dog i have ever seen would bite snap and was food aggressive   the sad think was he did not know how to play or go for a walk and i was told his tail had been cut off by previous owners   after having him nearly a year he can still snap on an odd occasion loves toys and having a ball thrown hes not food aggressive any more and loves cuddles   i know shelters have policy's about aggressive dogs and them being destroyed but im glad i rescued him even battling to prove i could change him even though i was told he was beyond help.   i do wonder if shelters sometimes think aggressive dogs should be destroyed because there is no hope i proved a point>

Management responded:   Dear customer,    Thank you for your info. I find this is totally unacceptable with our stores. I will get on to the matter and have this taking care of right away. I will make very sure this kind of situation with the fish will never happen again. Thank you very much for letting me know.    Sincerely.

20090227111016AAguoCi	Pets;Dogs	House-training advice please!!!?	I have a 6 mo. old male pug puppy who seems to delight in pooing in the house. He doesn't pee, he just poops. We have had him since he was 8 weeks old and have crate trained him. He does know how to hold it. He goes all night without making a mess and 2-3 hours during the day. I feel bad because he is basically stuck in his kennel all day long because he can't be out for more than 15 minutes at a time. Here's how it goes:   1) I take him outside and he promptly goes #1 and #2. (we don't come inside unless he does both)   2) He comes inside and plays   3) After about 15 minutes he goes into the living room and poops on the rug (today he learned how to jump on the couch and he pooped there). We have hardwood floors throughout the house except for the living room, where there is a rug. That is what he makes a bee-line for.      I know he knows what he's doing, because as soon as I see that he's made a mess, I call him in a very nice voice to come, but he runs and hides(he doesn't do that otherwise)   I am at my wits end and have tried everything, even leashing him in the house. Nothing works!

I'm getting a 9 week old shih tzu puppy in a couple weeks and I've been trying to write out a "puppy schedule" but since I work 2 jobs and 1 job is a set schedule every week and the 2nd job is very random scheduling, I have to make like 2 or 3 variations of my "puppy schedule" because of the random scheduling and I would like to try to feed my puppy at least twice before I head off to work (generally any time between 10am and 1pm).      Also, I know puppies should be kept on a routine schedule (so wake up same time, feed same time, potty same time, every day, etc). Would it be possible to get my puppy to wake up at a later time (like 9am or 10am?)? If so, how do I do that?

He is also eating way more than betta fish are supposed to! He can eat five pellets every hour!  His tank does not get dirtier if I feed him that, than if I feed him only five pellets a day.  He also eats a whole pinch of blood worms at one time.  He does not seem to be getting fatter either.  His tank has lately been at 83 degrees, though I usually keep it at 80 by unplugging the heater or opening the lid.      He is also jumping at the food when I drop it in!  Is this normal?  What really concerns me is him body slamming the sides of the tank!

20090309205355AAcITz7	Pets;Dogs	Did I say the right things to comfort her?	Is it ok to tell someone who has lost a pet dog 2 years ago who is still mourning that the cause of death is old age?  I mean, without an autopsy, we can only really guess at the cause when there are not apparent illnesses.  But when the dog is 16 years old, is it ok to assure the owner that it was his time when I knew it could've been a number of factors?  This particular friend feels guilty because she left him with a couple for a week because she had to do some travelling.  It wasn't the first time he had to board there, but this time he just stopped eating and drinking and died.  They told her it was because she left him there.  I told her no matter how much he missed her, he couldn't have died from that.  I assured her that it was old age and that dogs don't try to prolong life like we do and that while he missed her and wished she could've been there, he really died of old age.  I also advised her to move him (they had burried him somewhere and refused to tell her) to a closer location where she could easily visit in the future.  I said this will help lessen the guilty feeling because she will have him near her.  Of course she said it was a brilliant idea and called the couple up right away to ask them where they had burried him... so she is feeling better already.  But, now I feel guilty for saying something I don't know if was entirely true or not.      Help!  Tell me if it was ok for me to have said something I was unsure of (but that could have been true given the odds) if the main purpose was to comfort and to help a friend get over the death of her pet.  The only thing I could think of was, since we don't know the real cause, we might as well say it was old age.  But I need more reasons to get rid of the guilt (of uttering a possible falsehood)!

Her owners are AKC akita breeders.   I am worried though.. Will I be able to bond with her like I would if I got her as a baby? I love how akitas are loyal to their owner.. Will she become loyal to me?   At 1 year, will she be aggressive to me? Will she adapt to me and become loyal to me as an owner?   Thanks.. I'm afraid since she is older than a pup, she wont bond with me good.. which is what i admire in an akita..
20090309205618AAcmirc	Pets;Horses	Bar F splint boots...how good is this brand?	Does anyone know how good (or bad) Bar F ballistic splint boots are?   What about the brand in general?   I just bought them for my jumper mare. I got them at a tack store owned by a hunter/jumper trainer, but I have never heard of the brand. I used to ONLY get Pro Choice and Eskadron brand boots, but these Bar F's were $38 and I am on a very serious budget. I thought it was a great buy, but now I wonder about this brand and what kind of protection it will serve for my baby!         heres a picture.    http://i44.tinypic.com/9l8qkz.jpg

I just paid over $700 for 4 dogs to get their check-ups, vaccines, heartguard, ear medicine etc. Two of them need to have teeth cleaning also. While I don't mind making sure they get what they need to stay healthy, I was wondering if there is a way to save some money. I looked up a couple of companies and it would cost over $200 per dog yearly, so not much difference. What to do? And please no negative comments. Thanks.

I found him outside my neighbors house and he wasn't moving, so I thought he was dead. But, later I showed my son and we poked it and it moved. So, we brought him inside because I don't want him to die. What do I do?? I think he went back into hibernation. He is very, very small, about the size of a quarter.
20090309200650AAdqXEi	Pets;Dogs	My dog is acting strange, like losing coordination, and depth perception?	Okay, so one day I see my dog running around then all of a sudden his legs look like they almost give out on him, then later that day he runs up the stairs and his feet hit the stairs.  Then I start throwing him food like always but he can hardly catch anything, which is the oddest thing because this dog was probably the best dog I've ever seen at catching, you'd have to see it to know what I'm saying.  I mean EVERYTHING, so anyways he's tripping and he can't catch.  Now tonight I see him laying all alone in my parents room, so I go sit down next to him and start saying "Hey Buddy"  and he stares at me, then his ears perk up and he stares into the hallway (He always does this, I think he knows it freaks me out) so he's doing that and I keep saying "Hey Buddy"  and he kinda give me a glance then once again ears up and into the hallway again.  Then I say it one more time and did something that scared the **** out of me, he starts whimpering, louder and louder and he's looking at me then in the hallway, then like he's almost looking behind me, I don't know what he's looking at.  He's becoming very nervous and clumsy.  Does anyone know what's going on, or what this behavior is all about?

20090309202424AAJFvdW	Pets;Fish	Goldfish resting on the bottom, is that bad?	My little itty bitty chocolate telescope eye goldfish is very very active all day. He swims around the tank really fast and when I put my finger to the glass he follows it and it's very cute. He seems very happy. I hope so anyway.      But at around 11 he stops swimming so fast and starts going to the corner of the tank where the current isn't as fast (i'm pretty sure that's why he picks it because when I got another fish who died from new tank syndrome, that's the only spot in the tank he would go) and he just floats without moving in one spot and only moves his fins a lil to keep from sinking. He'll sink a little and then swim fast to get back up.      And after this for awhile he just lets himself sink and rests on the marbles at the bottom of the tank. He only does this at night and if I come up to the tank he magically stops and starts swimming around excitedly again.      Is resting at the bottom while sleeping (i think that's what he's doing) an okay thing for a goldfish to do as long as they aren't staying there all the time? Or is something wrong with its swim bladder or something?

He just had a basic procedure (beak clipped) and was held in a hand towel on his back in the nurse's hand.  He was being put back into his cage and I noticed that he was quiet - when he just went limp. His head was turned to the side at a right angle. They tried to revive him. He was dead.  He was a feisty little character - in the best of health.  Did she kill him?  I heard the vet say "what have you done!"     The vet later tried to say he had a heart attack.  Is it easy to strangle a bird? I am so sad.

20090309220617AAiT8bU	Pets;Dogs	Is it time to put my dog to sleep?	I feel like a jerk for asking but the thoughts becoming more pervasive. She is 13 years old. She has dementia and paces all night and day.  She has arthritic legs. She eats normally.  Sometimes she stares at her food bowl. She can't get onto her bed anymore. She is a grouchy old lady and she does respond to being pet. She sometimes "remembers" her old stomping grounds and goes there. She poops and pees in the house now and she will be walking and either will be falling out of her frail little, old body. I have suggested that maybe it's time to take her to the vet but my husband doesn't want to let go. We affectionately call her Zombie Dog because we think she may have already died, but is somehow still up and walking around (that was a joke). I feel sad because it won't be the same without her but I wonder if she is in pain.       We try to let her out to go but she comes right in the house, walks down the hall with a trail of urine following behind her. She pees so frequently through out the day we wash a load of towels just to keep up.      I am just trying to know if it's time or not. I have never had to take a dog to the vet for this purpose. Like I said, she paces to be let out at all hours of the night, she wants back in 5 mins later, then she wants back out again.

I don't change the litter when she does this and the rest of the week she is fine.      I've taken her to the Vet and she did have a Urinary Tract Infection which was taken care off.

My new pup is a Golden Pyrenees (yes a cross breed) 3 months and in a month my female Sharpei (pure bred) goes into heat (intend to fix her after her heat)... I watched them playing today and she is trying to seduce him!!!! Seriously, bum in face yadda yadda... So my question is, can he reproduce right now??? I figured no which is why I had no concerns about them together this heat but he looked like he was about to mount her today! My next question is "if" by some miracle he does do something (really hoping its not possible) His puppys are too big for her right? I mean I know there are cross breeds out there but could it hurt her, cause I am guessing it could... Thanks for any insight! My female is too close to her heat to spay her now so I am really hoping you write back and tell me it is impossible...

Ok im 19 years old and me and my girlfriend live with my dad just the three of us but before me and my dad got the house he always promised me that i could have a dog when we got a house But just a few months before we got the house i found these 4 kittens hiding in a bush they looked like they were freezing so i caught all of them wich wasent easy by the way  and i kept 1 of them and gave the other three to a shelter so anyways now that we have the cat wich we have had for about 1 1/2 years he says i cannot have a dog because we have the cat but 1 thing you must understand is my dad is a clean freak everything has to be perfect and i feel like i have tried everything to make him let me get a dog but he just keeps saying no i mean i owned 2 lizards for 7 years and took great care of them and i just gave them to a new home 2 days ago and we had 2 ferrets and we gave them away the same day so we got rid of all of our pets except for our cat And i was thinking that maybe now since we got rid of 4 of our pets that he may be a little more leanient on the idea of a dog but its just so hard and makes no sence to me as to why i cannot have a dog i have already showed that im responsible and i lost my job about 2 months ago so i would be home all the time to care and be with the dog and train him but i just don't know what to do to get him to let me get a dog does anyone have any ideas   ohh and by the way he says he doesnt wan't the dog to dig holes in the backyard and thats one of the biggest reason why he doesnt wan't us to have a dog first off he never even goes in our backyard nobody does i can barely even remember what our backyard looks like sometimes but me and my girlfriend live in the Garage its a 2 Car Garage so its a HUGE room lots of space and if we got a dog i would want to keep it in our room and take him outside everyday of course but i mean live in our room.

20090227114210AAnD87U	Pets;Dogs	How to keep water from getting everywhere when dogs drink?	I've got a minor dilemma-- My dogs splash water EVERYWHERE when they drink.      Not a problem in itself, but then the water runs everywhere all over my kitchen.  I tried mopping it up everytime I see it, but that's a hassle... so I tried putting a towel underneath the dish.  At first I thought it was working, until just now when I was refilling the water dispenser (it's a 2.5 gallon LeBistro dispenser, so it only needs to be filled every few days) and the towel was wet and the linoleum underneath turned a bit white... damaged from the water.      I, theoretically, could change the towel every time it gets wet, or every day, but I'm not sure my washer and dryer could handle that much laundry, not to mention-- I need clean towels for the kitchen and shower...      I tried putting a food mat underneath it, but that was worthless... it just ends up dripping off the mat and ends up underneath the mat, posing the same problem the wet towel would-- water damage to the linoleum.      Is there any tried and true methods to keeping the dogs from splashing everywhere?  Or methods to containing the water if they absolutely have to splash?

My horse has a slight issue with rounding up and collecting, so my trainer suggested side reins ( they connect from the bit to the girth and hold the horses' head in place on the bit). I do not know how to ajust them, do I allow room for him to move his head or do they stay tight to keep it there. If its tight won't he just rear or throw his head to get away from the pressure? I am not sure!!! Also, can I put them on him with me riding as well, or are they only for lunging?? Thanks

20090227143924AA9HyRq	Pets;Fish	Aquarium Help!- Bleach bucket and soapy water used to clean! Please help?	The day care girls at my mom's childcare center decided to clean the tank on their own. They used a bucket full of trap water to hold the fish (they are all tropicals- mollies, tetras and guppies).      They emptied the tank completely and used soapy water to wash it out- but probably didn't rinse it well at all. They have a bleach bucket to soak bibs and such in and used that (just newly emptied of the -heavy- bleach combination) to refill the tank and threw the fish in the bleach-y and soapy tank- no good bacterias and icy water (70 degree they are used to 78). I am taking the fish home to my tropical tank in hopes to save these fish.       I have a 30 gallon mature tank that is nearly empty. I was wondering if they had a chance and what could I use to help them out? I will be adding stress coat and aquarium salt. I wont be adding any of the day care water though since I dont want to kill of my tank as well...      I wish they had waited for ME to get it since I am a lot more experienced >> I have been working on a bad algae growth from it being in the sun- but they said it made the place look bad and they wanted a 'quick fix' but nothing with aquariums is a 'quick fix' sorry girls.

I don't want to declaw my cat, but she keeps tearing up all my furniture, especially all the arms on my brand new leather sofa.  I was told that getting her spayed "MAY" help.  I got her spayed anyways because I have no intention on breeding her, but she is still scratching away.  I have tried all the "no-scratch" sprays in the pet stores. I've got her scratching posts, cat nip, the cardboard box scratching thing, sprayed vinegar, sprayed water at her when I catch her doing it, and nothing seems to work....I am stumped. Seems like the only option left is to declaw her.  I've seen the web sights and really don't like the looks of the process. Seems very inhumane, especially when it's natural.  Help Anyone?

20090309234804AA0CuZI	Pets;Other - Pets	Ferret bully & cage scratching?	I have 7 ferrets, we got 4 of them a little later than the other 3, a few months ago. Anyways, I have this big ferret named Khali and recently he’s been mean to the other ferrets. He holds them down by their neck and ears and hurts them, they’re not playing. I don’t know what to do, if I give him to someone else he might not do too well without the other ferrets and vice versa.      Also, 2 of them scratch at the cage (Khali is one of them). Because of the texture, it is extremely loud and annoying. I know they do this because they want out (because they'll do it if we get close to their cage and/or make eye contact with them and they think we're gonna let them out).  I know you want to tell me to just give them their way. While I appreciate your advice, you must understand that not everyone lets their ferrets run wild 24/7 and me caging my ferrets does not make me a bad ferret owner. They get plenty of exercise, attention, everything they need and most of what they want.  They are out running free with TONS of toys all the time, we even take them outside to play sometimes.  However my ferrets need to be trained that they cannot come out whenever they want, my husband and I work from home and will not just give them their way whenever they do that, that’s like giving your child what they’re kicking and screaming for.      The only thing other than scruffing that we have been doing is putting them in the "bad cage" (just a plain, small cage with no toys or anything to do) for a few minutes but we can’t keep them in there all the time, plus they just rattle the door on that, and as soon as we put them back in the big cage they start scratching again.  So while we’re trying to work, not only can we not concentrate, but we have to keep getting up to put them in/take them out of the bad cage. We live with other people so we have no choice but to keep them in our bedroom which is where our computer/workspace is.      I’m not being rude but please help me out with this and don’t tell me to just give them their way or not to cage them.      Thanks so much for reading this rather long question lol!!

20090227135459AAcVwdJ	Pets;Dogs	What to do about our labrador with recurring neck pain?	We have a much beloved chocolate lab who will be 8 years old this March. We've had him since he was a pup and he is like our firstborn. But in the last few years, he's developed a recurring issue that we're having a very hard time dealing with. It's a long story, please bear with me...      Basically what happens is he'll do something seemingly benign (shake his head, sneeze, turn his head while standing up, etc.) and all of a sudden he'll start screaming in pain. Literally scream, it's heart-wrenching to hear. He'll continue to pace and yelp intermittently with certain movements and will not lay down or relax for at least 24 hrs after the initial injury. Back before all this started, he used to LOVE running and chasing his rubber ball. We had to cut that out completely, now he's lucky if he gets a short walk a day.      The first episode occurred over 3 years ago and we took him to the emergency vet. They ran an x-ray with no results but gave him some pain killers and muscle relaxants, watched him overnight and he was pretty much back to normal in a day or two. This scenario has since happened on average at least 3-4 times/year and he's usually better in a day or two. That was until last summer. It happened again when he turned to get up from a sleeping position, and it was really bad. It wasn't getting much better after a day so we took him into the vet which only made him worse, he freaked out and caused it to get worse so we took him screaming over to the emergency vet where we spent $3500 on 2 MRIs, a biopsy and a vet stay over 3 nights. After all that, the only thing we know is that it's not a spinal / disc issue, it's something muscular but we don't know what except that it probably can't be fixed. So the vet sent us back with prescriptions for the max amount of pain killers and muscle relaxants we can safely give him for whenever these attacks occur.       Well it just happened again a couple weeks ago. He hurt himself somehow just turning around to go out of a bedroom and he screamed like I've never heard before. Over and over, we all immediately were in tears. We had the meds on hand and gave them to him right away, but this time it really didn't seem to help him much. He couldn't calm down, his body was tense and quivering, he would yelp and cry throughout the day and night, even with the medication he was so tired but wouldn't let himself rest. It was awful and it went on for a few days until we couldn't take the lack of sleep anymore and our parents took him for us. He started acting better after about 4-5 days, but still had the occasional yelp. We've kept him on some the meds until just a few days ago.      Here is the biggest issue: I have a 2.5 year old son and another baby on the way due in a month. This last episode was the worst yet and I just don't know what to do if it keeps getting worse like this. The only other option given to us by the vet was to take him in when it happens and they can give him a sedative shot but they'd have to keep him overnight ($600 out the door). The episodes are completely unpredictable, but inevitable (could be 2 months, could be 9 months, but it will happen again), incurable and not effectively treatable.       We love this dog to death but are at our wits end thinking about what we should do with his situation. If anyone has any words of advice or similar situations to convey, I'd really, truly appreciate it. Sorry for the novel, it's just a complicated issue and I wanted to make sure I got the entirety of the problem across.

20090310001444AAQ6YEt	Pets;Cats	My 6mo old kitten started throwing up, has now thrown up about 4 times.  Is it serious?	We found our kitten wandering the streets of east la a few months ago, she was just over a pound and now she is 6 and a half pounds.  She's a very healthy eater, generally very energetic and happy.        Earlier tonight she started meowing sadly and then threw up all the food in her stomach.  She seemed okay after that but a little while later she threw up again.   She's thrown up 4 times now but the frequency seems to be decreasing.  She seems a little low energy now, just wants to lie down in her favorite spots.  We've offered her some yummy wet food and dry food as well as clean water all over but she hasn't seemed too interested.      Does anyone have any ideas what it could be?  We did get her shots and used revolution on her when we first got her but that is it.  She's been an indoor cat until the last couple days when we let her romp around while we are gardening.  All our plants are organically cared for, no chemicals.  We moved a little over a week ago and she seemed fine until now.

Hello i have had a fish tank for rougly half a year evry things going fine ive had a couple of guppys and a couple of catfish die but thats it. The problem is for about 3 months ive had an o#paline and a gold gouram i picked them because they are slow moving and are colourful but recently the opaline gourami keeps like attacking and nippling at the gold gourami. I took no notice at first i thought they were just playin and i found out gouramis dont have teeth anyway. But more recently the gold one has become less active and seems to hide and the bottom of the tank and in the corner. I know hes not ill because he still swims about and comes up around feeding time. Is there anything i can do and will my gold one die because of this or will he be ok just a little depressed at times. thanks   oh yeh if it hepls my tank is 60litres and i only have the two gouramis an albino catfish and an algae eating midget loach thanks :)

20090227112922AAGTPrM	Pets;Dogs	Any suggestions on how to make my puppy less aggressive when she's eating?	We have a 4 month old mini Schnauzer puppy who is extremely aggressive with her food.  We have an older dog (a Schnoodle who is one year old), and we feed him first -- to let him know he is the alpha-dog.  But Ellie, the little dog, flips out when we put his food out.  We have to hold her down to make sure she doesn't go after Shooter's food.  When we finally put her food out, she attacks it!  And then we have to hold her again while Shooter finishes his food (he is a super slow eater, but he is just slow/laid back in general).      Does anyone have any good suggestions on how to make her less aggressive with her food?  We are going to start her in puppy training very soon -- do you think that could help with the aggressiveness?

I say had because unfortunately My Silver dollars ate two right after they gave birth. So my question is how do I know my red platy is giving birth, she is acting strange and I was just wondering so I can put her in the breeder box when she is giving birth.      Her behavior is as follows:      She is not eating    She is staying at the bottom of the tank   She is breathing very fast!         She isn't fatter than normal nor is her tummy square, but then again neither was the others when they gave birth. They gave birth at night so I wouldn't know What they were acting like, although the one that got eaten 2 days ago were acting the same as this one and then 2 hours after I found her half eaten (NOT PRETTY) I noticed little fish swimming around.      I have thought of giving the Silver dollars to someone who has others, but no one wants them! I live in South Africa by the way.      Any help will be appreciated!

20090310021033AA1A6V8	Pets;Dogs	House training a 10 month old pup?	Hi, we have a 10 month old pup which we got from a friend 3 weeks ago and we are trying to house train her as her previous owner hadn't bothered to but i'm slowly running out of patience.      We walk her 3 times a day and we make sure she is let out after every meal and we keep the door open for her so she doesn't feel rushed, and she always does her business before we close the door.  She seems to be getting a lot better during the day while we are out and rarely has accidents in the house but at night she seems to be the worst.        She is guaranteed to poop and pee more than once during the night and we have tried to crate train her but she seems perfectly happy to do it in her crate and sit in it until we get up, she doesn't cry during the night either so we don't have any warning that she wants to go out.        Does anybody have any ideas how we can combat this?

(i can put my hand in the cage and mummy hamster is more than happy with me doing that)         any advice would be great.
