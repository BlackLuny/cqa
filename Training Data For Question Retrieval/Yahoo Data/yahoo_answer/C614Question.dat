20090205151946AAdkUQQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does it mean when a bf takes things from your dresser?	My bf and I have had a wonderful three years together, we know each other well and we have had some fun. Lately though, when ever he comes over the time's been spent  watching a movie and in silence. When he leaves, something is missing from my dresser. Undergarment wise. I don't understand it, though. Why would he take my undergarments? When I went to his house the other day, I thankfully found only mine hidden around his room. I confronted him, and he said it was nothing. Just things I'd left there. But I know otherwise. Any idea's to what's going on?    Thanks in advance;  Cam.

(which may never happen)       Or dating a few people casually where you can talk to each other and hang out but do no more than a little kissing maybe... but mostly just chatting and hanging out ?? - this might help you know who/what to do / what you like in a relationship for when the important ones come along...      but its sort of degrading to just have silly unimportant relationships??

20090205152224AAYzwO1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He sees his ex's too much?	my boyfriend, keeps hanging round his ex's all the time. We live about 40 minutes away from eachother anyways, so its hard enough. So when I see his face book and there are tonnes of new photos with his with his arms around one of them. And pictures from lots of nights out they have had that I knew nothing about.   He tells me stories about them all the time   and hes giving another one of them a lift right now as a favour.   am I over reacting? or is this unfair?   I get the feeling that he is taking advantage of the fact that I wouldn't find out if he cheated.    xxx   xxx
20090205152416AAIFtKq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So what do you think of this?	So, last night, it was kinda late, like 12:30. My friend (call him S) messaged me on msn, "What are ya at up this late ba? Go to bed outta it!" and I was like, "ha ha, no, you! I'm talking to R". He asked me a little bit about school, then asked me who R was, "who's that ba? yer man?" I was like, "no, we went out at camp, he's an ***, ha ha." He said "punch him in the face then, I will for ya :P" and I said "ha ha, maybe, lol." He asked me like two more questions about him, and then asked if he was ugly. I said, "decide for yourself" and sent him a pic. He called him gay, and not cool (it was a pic from cadet camp, he was wearing a beret, lol). By this time it was about 1 or quarter after, and he said "Go to bed!!!! talk to you tomorrow, night! xo" He never says that, not to me (xo). I was like... hmm, okay, this is kinda different and so I said "yup, later, see you tomorrow, xxx". And we both went offline. Do you think that he meant anything by the xo? lol. Sometimes in school, like I'll be in the library with my friend and he'll wave to me or come in and talk for a minute and sit down. So, what do you think of this? We're both 15, and single... lol. Opinions, please! lol. Thanks in advance!

20090205152236AAwq2zv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I be mad or am I just crazy!?	Ok so my boyfriend and I have been dating for 5 months but have been seeing each other for 8. When I met him he had broken up with his first and only girlfriend 6 months previous. They dated for 3.5 years, lived together, had a dog together...she broke his heart and he was depressed, etc. We then started dating but I noticed that they still talked all the time and he would go and see their dog once or twice a week. It bothered me a bit but I didn't say anything because I was hanging out with one of my ex's who is(still) my best friend. But my ex introduced himself to my boyfriend, and they talked every time he came over and it was definitely clear to everyone involved that I was very much into my boyfriend. But the talking between my boyfriend and his ex happened every single day and she would complain to him about her current boyfriend and it began to really bother me. So I took a step to email her and say that I thought it was important that they remain friends but I would love to meet her if she would like to come over, etc. She never responded to me but immediately told me boyfriend about it. In every other way he's very very sweet and loving, we live together now and everything is fantastic. I feel that I can't say anything about it but the ex I hang out with ...we haven't dated in over 5 years but his ex was his first love etc. What should I do about how I feel about it!

20090205152709AA7lR8s	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Dating Older Man Help?	I am a mature woman with a man 19 yrs older than me. We get along very well and enjoy being together.

20090205152712AAu9cJD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would he shy away from me if I might have problems?	This guy & I are really close, serious and pretty much considered bf/gf, even though he lives (right now) in a different city (3 hrs away) anyway, we know that we love each other, we even tell each other that. Anyway, just recently I learned that I've been having kidney problems & he knows and we talk about it, but not in depth, like it seems like he doesn't want to know any further. I was telling him that I have to checked because I've been having pain and that my dad had past issues with his kidney (cancer) but he didn't ask anything about my dad or what was wrong with him, thinking he might be concerned. Today I had put on my mypsace status that I was seeing the doc and now getting a cat scan tomorrow and that I'm nervous. SO far I haven't heard anything from him, like are you okay, etc. So I'm wondering should I be concerned that he's not talking to me or why is he being like this? I dunno, if he were in my situation I would definitely be concerned and making sure I was fine. Does he not think it's a big deal? He even had a friend's mom that was having tests done & he put "worried" status on his myspace for her, so what is going on? I'm also wondering if he would shy away from having anything serious if I might have problems in the future?? I guess I'm just stressed sorry! =(
20090205153241AAXWAcU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I really love this guy...?	but he has a gf. They've been going out for about 1 week or so, but they've been breaking up and getting back together for about 2 years now. Everyone in our grade says he doesn't really like her, because she's a brat. I've liked him since kindergarten, and when I was younger he used to like me. He always stares at me mysteriously and will stare at my chest area obsessionally (at least I think my chest). He also e-mails me regularly. One time I told him I'm kinda weird and he's like, "no your not." He's really sporty and popular, one time I beat him in 100 meter dash, and he smiled at me and said "dang!". I'm kinda sporty, I do track, year-round soccer, and volleyball. But earlier this year he got mad because she didn't want to kiss him.   She says she's probably going to break up with him because she likes this other sporty guy.....    I haven't directly told him I like him, but everyone in our grade knows I do. It got out about 7th grade, but no one really talks about it anymore. I'm really really really shyy......   If they break up, what should I do?

Sorry to use that phrase. we have been dating for a month and are now bf and gf. We are taking it slow physically. we are both christians. I am 32 and he is 35. It just seems so right, and we communicate so well together. there's is so much chemistry, not just physically, but emotionally, spiritually and mentally. I really am thinking that something will happen. He said to me that its been a while since he's liked anyone as much as me. So the question is how do you know? I think I know, but just want to hear other people's thoughts. thanks

This girl who is in 2 of my 3 classes sits next to me, and she has called me an asshole and jerk numerous times. Today the professor spent 30 minutes trying to explain a concept, and when he asked if anyone has questions. This one girl raises her hand, and says "I don't get it". The professor starts laughing, and I tell the girl sitting next to me that he's laughing at her. The girl next to me says "OMG stop you're such a jerk!", but she does it in a smiley scolding way hard to explain. Any thoughts?

20090205154854AADSb3U	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I am mostly happily married, but he doesn't initiate sex.?	I always used to intiate sex. We had sex like rabbits before! I started getting so sick of always having to be the one to initiate sex though. If I don't initiate it, he won't either. I'm attractive, he's horny... We love each other, how do I teach him to initiate sex without offending him? He apparently was kinda dorky before I met him, and turned into a little hottie later in life.... He's a little passive/lacking in confidence I think.. (Oh.. and we've talked about this problem before too, in good and bad ways)

But he may have picked up on the hint. I think there is a possiblity that he likes me. We have the same group of friends who generally always go out together. The last few times we have gone out to a club i've most definitly hit on him. Inbetween these times we have talked, both he and I have initiated the conversations. We might be going out tonight(as a group of friends).    should i not initiate any conversation or dancing to see if he does?

20090205154621AAcqDge	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband will want half custody of my daughter but he is abusive?	What will I have to do? The odds are not on my side. He has been married before and has two children from that marriage. Its shared custody, and I dont want that for my daughter. He has physically and emotional abused me and I have given him counseling and many chances. I m afraid for her, afraid he will beat her down verbally and emotionally like he did me. I have never seen him physically hurt his other kids but he has put them down. And his other daughter has a real problem with self esteem. I dont want him NOT to see her, I just want control of the situation so that if I sense the slightest sign of abuse I can intervene. I dont want to helplessly watch her go through what his other daughter does, and not be able to do anything about it like his ex. What can I do? I only want what is best for her!!! She is only 13 months old at the moment...
20090205154322AAmgcGh	Family & Relationships;Family	I just found out I was adopted! Do I have the right to react like this?	I just found out I was adopted.

20090205154420AACEoJz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Reasons not to go to Prom?	My best friend is determined to make me go to our Senior prom. Truth is, I really don't want to go. there are some nice dresses for prom that I like, but I can't imagine me wearing one, let alone going to a public place while wearing it. She has a boyfriend, and I have never had a boyfriend or even asked out. the closer the day comes, (April 17) the more she talks about it. She makes it sound like fun, but I feel like I'll just be depressed the whole time.    These are the reason why I don't want to go   - My mom didn't go   - I hate wearing dresses   - I have no one to go with (all my guy friends have girlfriends)   - I don't want to be a third wheel with my best friend and her boyfriend.    - It's expensive, and I have very little money.      That's pretty much where the list ends. I need more reasons... >.> anything is fine by me.

20090205160042AAImVyf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Need help, relational problem (girl help needed) but guys help too would be nice?	My best friend (guy) and my other best friend (girl) broke up last night/this morning i guess. I'm very close to both of them. I guess he isn't taking it that hard, he kind of doesn't do that much. She is taking it bad, and she talks to me quite a bit. I'm like a brother for her, and I really need to know what to say and do to help her. I'm pretty good at helping already, that's why she comes to me with a lot of stuff, but I just want to make sure she is comfortable.   She says she needs someone, and wants to get out of there (house) and is alone right now sobbing alone to herself txting me. She really misses him and is kinda probably blaming herself and throwing question on question on herself.    So girls, if a relationship was broken up what would you want to hear? And if you thought the guy didn't care that much, and didn't care about you anymore?

20090205155446AAYEgN8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I really like her! What should I do?	I really like this girl. We used to talk online almost everyday but now we only talk once in a while. She's great. She's the prettiest person that I have ever seen. I really want to go out with her. I have liked her for the last year. When I started to like her, her friends asked me if I liked her, but the girl I like told me it didn't mean a thing. I can't give up on my feelings, I already tried but couldn't.      Do you think when her friends asked me if I liked her it did mean something?      I can't wait, she's on my mind all day long every single day      How do I tell her? I have no idea how to do it, I'm way too nervous and shy to tell her how I feel. I'm never alone with her at school. I never hang out with her outside of school. I think she may know because it used to be really obvious that I like her, but now we barely talk. What should I do?      HELP!      --------------------------------------...      I was think of asking her tomorrow to hang out sometime this weekend and then hang out with her later on too and on Valentine's, I'd ask her to hang out but that time, I'll give her some flowers, tell her how I feel and ask her to be my girlfriend.      What do you think?

20090205160115AAdProS	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is my friend in the wrong here or what?	My friend (who had a baby 2 years ago) goes out quite a bit clubbing etc and Im 22 female and have only been once because Im quiet, the loser type and never have friends to go with etc but she never invites me out with her friends. Yet if it was the other way round and she had no friends Id invite her out cause I wouldn't like to think of her stuck in lol. Anyway she rang one day last week and she said what are you doing tonight and I said 'nothing Im stuck in why, what are you doing' she said 'Ive been asked out im going to a club with friends but wanted to know if you'l babysit for me', I felt a bit evil saying 'no I don't want to' so I said 'well I might have to go to my aunts she's having a party' she said 'I'l pay you if you want, you don't have to go to the party do you' I said 'thats not the point Id babysit for free but don't think I'l be able to' but I kinda feel bad cause its as though she can't go out because of me she had no one else to babysit. At the same time Im a bit upset cause I thought she was going to ask if I wanted to go for a night out with her but instead she wanted me to babysit lol.      The same thing happened today as well she's rang up twice today asking if I'l babysit tomorrow. I can't just say no as Im her sons godmother lol I feel tight so always make excuses.   Im not doing anything but am I being mean or is it her thats too pushy?

My brother is a 26 year old schizophrenic who is really quite unwell at the moment but because the mental health team are crap they cant be bothered to go through the process of sectioning him and just got the police involved. He's been making alot of death threats towards my mum whos pretty depressed already and even though we're all used to the way he is, I don't think my mum can take much more of the abuse and heartbreak. She's on anti depressants and drinks quite a bit, but obviously these things are just covering up the problem. She had a heart attack a little while back and I'm just really worried about her. I know my brothers never going to get better, and so I'm starting to think she wont either, and I just want her to be happy again. I'm 17, so not a child, but just can't think of a way to make things alright. Apart form be there for my mum, what can I do to help?

20090205155935AAmh3Y0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I went out with this guy, and now he's gone..?	i went out with this guy over christmas break. i like him soo much, and i thought he cared..       he was always trying to move to fast, so i wouldn't go to far with him. Turns out he was only using me.. he didn't care. the worst part is, i almost had sex with him. i can't believe how manipulative this guy is! i almost fell for it. but i guess i'm still not over it, and it's February. Every time i thought of him, it was like someone was ripping a hole through my stomach, this weird, aching feeling. it's gotten a little better, but i wish i could just forget him.       i think it hurts so much because he got his 'new' girlfriend to call me and dump me for him, like wth! i was so pissed. he ruined my whole christmas vacation.       so i think what i'm asking is.. has this ever happend to you? no necessarily the same situation. but the pain you felt every time you heard his name? if you did. how did you deal with it? or how do you think i could move on and forget?      anything you guys have to say i will appreciate. i just want this bastard out of my life. thanks :)
20090205155045AA2Cf2m	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Stubborn and overprotective friends?	I understand friends looking out for you and stuff like that, but my friends do not even ask the guys name when I say I like someone. They just say "you better watch out, it could be another Sean" (Sean wasn't even that bad, we dated for a year and he got a little clingy, that's all).    And I sit with my friends EVERY day at lunch. If I ask them even days in advance if I can sit with my crush at lunch one day out of the week they get pissed off and act as if I had ditched them.   When I do go end up going out with the guy I like, they act stubborn and are not willing to get to know the guy, they just automatically judge him in a bad way.      What can I do to make them not act like my freaking parents?   No, not my parents. Even they handle my relationships better than my friends do.

20090205155004AAFQBqU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Life's turned upside down...What should I do?	Here are a few off my problems...      I like most of my friends as individuals but whenever we're in a group I always find myself being drowned out by them constantly competing for attention, shouting over each other and not listening...And finding new friends is not an option trust me- because they're the girls in all my classes...lol      The guy I slowly realized I like is going out with one of my best friends. He had liked me for almost all of last yr but I was too blind to realize how great he was and now I've lost my chance...      I get a lot of pressure put on me for doing well in my sports...eg. training, competing and I just can't stand it even though I can't give up on it either...      I'm a good student and I get good grades although I want to do a lot better because I know I can, except most of the time I feel so down that I can't be f*cked putting in the effort      Everything seems to go against me...like all the little things...and whenever something good does happen to me there's always a big catch      Please share some advice that might cheer me up! Thanks xxx

20090205155056AA29cN0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	When you really like a girl, who likes you, but is embrassed of you, how can you ask her out?	I can see it in her eyes that she likes me. the only reason she hides it is because she thinks i geeky. i'm not, i'm just really smart. how can i get her to be prouder of me, because i really like her.
20090205155257AAXlQ9o	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is this Jealousy???or what?	Thanks for all answers in Advance. Okay from the beginning of the school year me and two gurls started hanging out eventually we got really close. One of the two gurls her name is Crisi got distant from me & the other gurl Stacey, becuz of a new gurl that came to the group her name is Jaz. No one liked Jaz literally people said she was crazy, she did have issues but idk. Crisi got distant, so now it was just us with another gurl added to the group. Stacey & Jaz grew close quick, they bonded more than me & stacey ever did. Me& Stacey knew each other way before Jaz. The group grew over time but then eventually divided becuz of the bond that Stacey & Jaz was having. Hey! call it Jealousy i was kinda at first but now the group is narrowed down to like stacey, jaz, me and anotha chick. Everytime we go out its all about stacey& jaz & i feel like me and the other chick are just tag alongs like okay. We are all friends we should all bond the same way. The new chick doesn't like Jaz, i barely like her from the start. & to me its just so weird how stacey just put her above us in everything. I have never had this type of friendship with a group of gurls, stacey even comes 2 pick jaz up afterclass. The new chick feels the same way about them. I told Stacey how i felt becuz me & her were the same way except i never treated any1 like outcasts, so telling her this didn't change a thing. Now, I can't stop the close bond that they have i think its cool everyone needs a friend like that, but its an extent that you go to. Sometimes i just wish stacey culd think about how different our bond is now & how much have change. I get so aggravated its to the point where lately im starting to distant myself like today i barely seen any of them, I just went straight home after school. But i feel so bad becuz i don't feel comfortable in this TYPE of friendships. They are good gurls, but no matter how much me & the other gurl complains nothing changes. So i feel like its time t move on... WHAT DO YOU THINK????

20090205155659AAaphuN	Family & Relationships;Friends	Advice needed please!?	so this past summer my family decided to move states and now I am in a new school (it's my junior year) and of course I was really upset about it because I would lose all my friends, but I was trying to be optimistic about it. Well, it has been about 6 months and I still don't have my group of friends. I have aquaintances at school that I talk to, but nobody seems to want to take it any further than that or hang out. I don't understand, I joined 3 clubs, I am nice to everyone, and I was friends with almost everyone at my old school! I am just sick of feeling lonely and I want to enjoy my last year and a half of high school. I sometimes cry out of the blue because of it and I usually never cry! So any advice from people who have transferred or anyone in general would be appreciated.   thanks a bunch.

20090205155843AAaZWAb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What's wrong with me? what to do? :'(?	My bf called me plain, but he would mostly call me beautiful. He called other girls gorgeous, so hot, so beautiful. when he's with his friends, he would stare at hot girls and say that the girl is hot and that he would really love it if she was his. and when his friend asked him how about me, he would say "I don't care". To be honest, he isn't even that handsome, but ever since I fell in love with him, I think that he is the most handsome guy ever. He rarely spends time with me. He would mostly play games instead and play music.   He left me lots of times before. He called me names, put me down, forbid me from having any guy friends, but at the same time he flirts with other girls. but as soon as he tells me he still loves me, I would come running back with open arms to him.      The crazy thing is, even after all that, I still love him. And deep inside, I hope he would beat me badly one day so that I could have the heart to leave him and forget about him. Soon, I'll be moving to somewhere far away from my family with him. Although I know that we would never be happy, I just do that in hope that someday he would beat me. what's wrong with me? what should I do? I'm so confused.

20080929140257AAR8oUE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	It's a little long, but please answer whether I should pursue this guy?	So I have had the biggest crush on a guy that works the concierge desk in the lobby of my apartment building. He's extremely good looking, very nice and sweet, and has a lot of ambition. We usually flirt a little bit when I walk by and say hi, nothing major.      But last thursday, he helped me with some curtain issues in my apartment, even getting a maintenance guy to do it. When I was down there, I had my face half-hidden in my sweater (it was cold that day) and he goes "Stop doing that, its so cute....you're making this very hard for me." As I was leaving to go back to my apartment, he called out to me and came up and asked me to come by Sunday (today). So today, I spend pretty much the whole day at the internet cafe, which is all glass and is about 20 feet from the desk, so he was waving and smiling most of the time. At one point, he even came in to ask if I wanted anything from the store downstairs, and ended up buying me a soda. From time to time, I would go out and we would chat and flirt a little bit more. When he went out for a cigarette, I told him how much of a deal-breaker smoking was for me, and when he came back he goes "deal-breaker? There isn't even a deal...yet." We kept smiling at each other, and then I finally got bored of being in the lounge and went out to buy carpet cleaner, I came back we chatted a bit more, and then I went home.         I know this isnt a lot of information to go on, but do you think he might like me? Enough to ask me out at some point? I haven't really expected him to ask me out or for my number yet since we don't really know each other, and he does work in my building. But I really like him, and I want to know how I can get to know him enough for him to get my number. Thanks!         And just fyi for people that get offended, I was only being playful about the smoking, it doesn't make me like him any less. But when I did say it, he was pretty bent on convincing me that he was gonna quit by his next birthday.      And no, I didnt spend the whole time there because of him, I usually study in there to get away from the distractions in my apartment.      Update: Today we flirted a little bit, and he said after he made some food for Rosh Hashanah, if it turned out well he'd bring me some today :)

20090205161403AA1Z2Rc	Family & Relationships;Friends	What do you do when your best friend has hurt you in more ways than you knew possible?	I have been friends with this girl for most of middle school and most of freshman year. Like all friendships, there have been some bumpy parts that we went through, but when I confessed to her that I had a crush on her exboy friend she told me it was ok when I also told her that I wasn't going to do anything about it (and I wasn't). Then a few days later I found out that she went on yahooanswers and told everyone her side of the story and people judged me without actually knowing what was going on. She showed me the link to her question where I saw everything people said about me. It hurt me a lot, and I told her this and she promised me that she wouldn't do this ever again. Now, a few weeks ago my triplet sister and my best friend got into a fight over things that I doubt that they even understand. Part of it has to do with how my BFF has a crush on my sister's BFF (my sister's best friend is a guy) and because she doesn't seem to understand that guys and girls can be friends and not have to like eachother, she thinks that they have to be dating. After she came to that conclusion she started following my sister and the boy whenever she could. The boy ended up saying that he was going insane from my best friend following him around, my sister told me. I kept my mouth shut because I was happy as long as my best friend was happy, and she clearly was. When this fight started to happen, my sister was telling me to go against my BFF, and my BFF told me her story which said that nothing is her fault, but it takes two to fight, and she said that I had to take her side and try to talk to my sister. I would have done this for her if I could have but I couldn't because it would have meant that I would be going against my sister, so I said no. My sister and my bff settled their differences, but my bff and I were not ok as far as our relationship. I have found that I really don't like myself and I am trying to learn to like myself but I can't. My bff doesn't seem to understand this, so she and I aren't really speaking and I am worried for her because she has been skipping classes and today my teacher noticed that she left before the class was over and he was fuming. I am trying to tell her to stop but she won't listen to me anymore. She is jealous of a friend that I have been helping with her personal life as well as playing the flute and I told my bff that that's all we do, but she won't believe me. So today when I was talking to her on fbook and she sent another link to yahooanswers of her complaint about me, looking at what she wrote about me was like a punch in the gut. So I am taking this problem where it started and asking you what should I do?

20080105120515AAyEkoa	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this girl misleading me, or does she really like me?	So there is a girl I really like.   Lately she sounds kind of meaningless/unsure when she says things like "I love you, I like you, your amazing" etc.   She lives quite a distance from me, about 6 hours or so.   She has explained to me that she has had a long distance relationship before, and that it didn't work out DUE to the distance. The thing that confuses me about that, is she seemed so determined to be with me before. No matter what.   Now she seems to be doubtful and hesitant that it would work out, which leads me to believe that maybe the feelings she had for me are now gone.    She even told me that shes led on guys in the past to prevent hurting them, and that's what I feel like is happening to me.      She still calls me every night,   and she falls asleep without getting off the phone.   She says she doesn't want to get off the phone with me,   that's why she just falls asleep.      Someone help me out here?   Shine some light on this please.
20080112154250AAGeLWX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does are some things i do to get with girls but its not all that  good how do you think i could improve at it?	Have good personal hygiene. You don't have to be Brad Pitt to get women. For the most part, just caring about how you look is enough. Wear new clothes that fit, and make sure that your body is clean (important).    Keep up a good posture, walk steadily and smile. Women do not like slouchers. Bad posture gives an air of lack of confidence. Smiling makes a guy more welcoming. A good walking style, (straight back, a hand in the pocket and taking well distanced strides) gives the impression of intelligence.    Adapt your appearance. Clean up for a high-class city girl. Dress down for the fun-loving motorbike chick.    Pick a location frequented by a significant number of girls where you feel fairly comfortable, perhaps a place that is conducive to a skill of yours: music, public speaking, or a private intimate conversation. Go out and have a good time. Guys who stare and walk around constantly looking for women immediately lower their value. Go out with your friends to a bar or club (or any public place, such as a bookstore, if you're more of the studious type) and start out by genuinely having a good time. The Internet does not count.    Be funny. If you're not naturally funny, don't try too hard around her. Pitch jokes to other people first and see how the jokes do with them. If you get no laughs there, just pray, because it's gonna be hard winning a girl without humor.    "Plant some seeds". Flirt casually with waitresses. Make a passing comment and smile to a girl walking by. Toast a woman at the bar. Then go back to having a good time with your friends. In short time, you'll notice women slowly gravitating to you.    Qualify them. Don't be a jerk about it... but in a fun, playful way, make her prove her value to you. Something as simple as "Are you open-minded? Cool, because I like open-minded people."    Talk. Silence is uncomfortable. (On the other hand, women or men who do nothing but talk and never listen can be annoying.)    Connect with her. Find out what you have in common, and reward her with a smile and a story of your own if she tells you something unique about herself that you can relate to. WARNING: If she gives you something like "Oh, I like to go shopping", don't reward her for that. It's not unique. Instead, ask for more information and then connect with it.    Look and touch. Looking into a girl's eyes shows respect and interest. A firm handshake, a gentle pat on the back, a light touch of the hand and other subtle gestures allow the girl to feel connected with the guy.    Feel great. The feeling will radiate and affect the lady too.    Don't pretend to be someone you aren't, you may think you will win her over with like mindedness, but in the end she will find you out. Find a common interest, something you both like instead.    Show your interest. The best way to get out of the "friend trap" is to avoid it from the start. After finding common interests, make your intentions clear. "You know, I just realized it. Not only are you pretty, but you're fun to talk to."    Ask for her number. Give her your phone, tell her "Put your number in my phone and I'll call your phone so you'll have mine."    And once you establish that special, exclusive relationship of boyfriend and girlfriend do not--I repeat--do not stop the chivalry. Women are too special to only be waited on conditionally. The best way to show her you care is to continue to do the little things for her. You still need to open her car door, walk her home, kiss her goodnight. ALWAYS call her at night to bid her goodnight (it's best to wait a few hours after your date to do this, otherwise you'll seem a tad desperate.) Remember, show affection and respect and you'll get affection and respect.

20080308115032AAuaUW5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Will you really avoid him?	Ladies! If you think there is this guy who is interested in you, but you cannot be certain, will you go great lengths to avoid him? So, everytime for whatever reason he wants to reach out to you, you avoid him at all costs.      Do you avoid people whom you think are interested in you, but you do not like? And you do it without really finding out the real reason.

20080423154312AAGlujV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Okay, ENOUGH!!!What is it about Me?	I have no friends, but I talk to everyone, and anyone. I make girls laugh. However, I never seem to get a freaking girlfriend. Is this a cure? Since ever! Never! I will soon be off to college. I just asked another girl out today, a freaking LOSER too. Asking a girl out is never my problem, I do, all the freaking time. She completely shut me the F*ck down! WTF? Okay, enough. The next time any girl try to flirt with me like they always do, or all that bullshit, i'll just turn to them like GET THE F*CK OFF ME!   Is it a curse I have? What The F*ck is wrong with me? I know I sound arrogant and aggressive here, but I am the nicest guy you will ever meet. I am not just saying that. I never show anger, always smile, always helpful, always nice, accomodating and considerate of people's feelings. BUT all of this will never follow me to college. I intend to be so mean, that i might get kicked the F*CK out. (And i get all As and Bs. So, wtf? Not like i'm a loser. I am one of the best dressed!)

And then when I look back, he has this blank stare in his eyes, as he begins to run his fingers up my chest. Then he just squeezes my butt more.

20080925102309AAY96ZW	Family & Relationships;Family	Any Stepmother's reply...?	My husband has other children from a previous marriage. We have children together, but it seems that his other children remain on pedastals. He misses important dates for our children, but makes sure to schedule in his other children's important dates. He NEVER goes to any doctor appointments or hospital rooms with us...but he makes a point to drive over 3 hours to get to his other children's hospital visits which always minor issues. When his chidlren come to visit, he is the best father in town. But each day at home with our children, he is too tired to play, converse and quite frankly I think he ignores us. My mother-in-law, comes over only when his other children visit, then she is a cool grandma, playing with them and doing arts and crafts. But when his other children are not here, she doesn't even think to call my children at all. His other children come over and get whatever they want from my husband. I truly think my husband feels guilty leaving them behind. His ex-wife was caught cheating, so he had no alternative and was too young to know what was right. Please don't think that I do not love his other children, I adore them. I love having them and I beleive they love me. My family ALWAYS includes them. But whenever they come around, I just can't help but fee jealousy. Am I wrong to feel this way? Or do I have a right to feel this way? Anyone have any suggestions?
20080929133020AAJFAB3	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Need Advice URGENT Trying to move during a divorce.?	I am in the middle of a divorce and we have an ok parenting plan. The last 4 1/2 weeks  my ex has been out of the country on business and has not had any contact with our children (who primarily live with me). In our parenting plan it states that the custodial parent shall not remove the children from the state without giving the non-custodial parent 60 days notice. My dad has to have back surgery for the 4th time and will be unable to assist my grandparents for some time. My grandfather is a paraplegic and in a wheelchair and my grandmother's heath is deteriorating quickly. They want me to move back home ASAP.

20061126023328AAKDkVy	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What to do about an "wanna be" arsonist?	I live in my b/f's home & have for over 2 yrs. Recently my mentally handicapped daughter has been staying with me for an undetermined amount of time. Her IQ ranges at the level of a 5 yr old child. He has not liked her being in his home and wants her gone ASAP. I am doing everything possible to get her into another appropriate setting for mentally retarded individuals. His home is a 100 yr old dump with no heating system, warped floors, bad plumbing, & outdated electrical wiring. He wants out of this dump that he bought before he met me, but owes too many $$$ on it to be able to sell it. He can't rent it out for enough each month to be able to cover the monthly mortgage. So he made a "suggestion" that he burn the house down to collect the insurance on it. This is shocking enough, but he decided it would be a good idea to make it look like my MR daughter set the fire. He seems to believe she can't be held accountable. I corrected his wrong belief and told him NO. How would u handle it?

My current love and I have known eachother for 2 and a half years and came together through friendship first, THEN FELL IN LOVE but eventually ended up sleeping together. We were both married when this happened. We confessed how we felt and what we had done to our spouses. His marriage was bad long before hand, and so was mine, which is not an excuse at all. Now that we are both divorced, we want to be together fully. I am frightened that he may do to me what we did together to our spouses. We both have never felt this way before, and have great communication and connection. He is my best friend and I am his. Can this relationship survive monogomy?

20081107130649AA7pCib	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I really need help, I don't know what to do next!! ADVISE NEEDED DESPERATELY!?	I've been talking to this one particular guy for about a year now. Off and on, every now and then. I've known him for two years. Lately we have been really getting close. We have both fessed up and told each other our feelings. He said he never said anything before had because in his opinion I only saw him as a friend. Plus every time he was single I was in a relationship and vise versa. He is so special to me. And last week he came over. We had sex. I couldn't help myself. It was sooo good too. Now he says that im being distant and it seems like im hiding something. I can't help but agree with him. He says that his friends tell him that they don't know why were not together yet. I want to be with him really bad. But his history isn't that good. He has never been able to keep a girlfriend. And ends up never talking to them again afterwards. I don't want that though. If for some reason we broke up I still would want him in my life. He is too special to me for that. He thinks I'm being distant because we had sex. Trust me, I want him again, I'm just afraid. I don't do the whole friends with benefits thing. I just couldn't help myself. And after we had sex it made me realize that I really care for this man and I want to be with him. I really need advise right now. And not that whole give me criticism thing. Thats not what I am looking for. Thanks =]

(I'm 5'3", and I used to think that it was too tall.)   Today I was thinking, "it wouldn't be so bad being tall. 5'9' wouldn't be a bad height."    But all of my friends tell me that guys don't like girls who are over 5'6", because it isn't "cute." I beg to differ, since I know a very cute girl who is over 6 foot.      Anyway, guys!   What are your opinions of tall girls? Do you like them? Or do you prefer short girls? What was the tallest girl you ever dated? Do you think tall girls are sexy? Would you date anyone slightly taller than you?       Thanks in advance! :)

20090103125205AAKIBg5	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	If marriages are made in heaven, then why do people break it?	my story starts back in January, 2008..almost the last days of that month and my parents and I were searching for my soul mate.  Out of the blue this man showed up...who is now my husband.  We had lots of ups and downs during the preparation for wedding...even a week before I said no to the marriage...traditional marriage.  But then he started saying i'll keep you happy, i am sorry for what happened in the past.....and just to let you know we had our engagement on April 5 and had court or legal marriage done week after April 19 for green card purposes.  So, according to the law we are married since April...but start living together July 23 after the traditional marriage.  Because, in Indian wedding we go through horoscope matching and find out marriage date through that. And there was no good date that was coming in between April and July. Anyways, we got married and after 15 days I came to know my parents and brother got into severe accident on highway...and my mom was very much hurt...and i insisted to go to NJ....I was in MA....but he didn't like to idea and we had a huge fight...in front of his mom and sister he yelled at my parents and cursed at them.  But I ended up going...when he find out my mom is in CCU.  At that time he said he'll pick me up within 1 week but he ended up coming after 3 weeks almost a month later....after my mom talked to his family...about why he is not coming....is there something wrong?   Then he came and we went back to our house; we lived together two mounths with some arguments, yet not severe.  End of Oct. according to our traditional festivals I was suppose to go to my parents house....and he let me at that time...everything was normal.  But when I came back....I found out that his parents and himself had a big talk with my mom.  When I went to my parents on the bus he didn't give me any money for the way or to get anything from there...and I was suppose to take box of sweets for my brother...well, my mom talked to him about that and I don't know how the conversation went further...where his parents started accusing me, saying what was the need of buying luxurious things for house...(tv, laptop, etc.) when there is a need to save money (at that time they were take half of his salary and still wanted us to save money out of what was left)......also as his nature, he likes to brag about getting his masters done from Houston Univ. in engineering.....which no one in my family like...including me.  So, he somehow said that to my mom and saying that if I get good amout of job anywhere in the world I'll definitely go.  My mom didn't liked it, that he'll go anywhere for money even his wife or if any kids won't go.  So she said to him, son, don't go after money...money you can earn doing any profession......even the street (call) girls earn good amount of money............that bothered him so much and in return he said to my mom, you also work in that kind of enviornment, where people gamble, smoke, drink, and girls are around (my mom works in casino as cashier).......after that day not even one week we spent was enjoyable or only for us.........he told his mom I am not going to talk to her parents and if I ever talk to them my attorney will be there with me...and his mom started searching for attorney's for divorce.....because my mom (that same day) said to them if my daughter is not going to stay happy in your place then I am going to call her back.     Long stroy short, November went, he didn't talk to anyone in my family...I also didn't talked to his family members that much....when I see them I talked though.  I sat down with him and talked about our future......bad thing in him that i noticed is that he listen to other people a lot....especially his family members...and his sister the most.  whatever she suggest.....i donno if she really suggest or just give him decision.....he do that.  we were very tight financially,  he earned good amount every month....not what he told us (me and my family) in the beginning but still good enough to save and spent.....but from there his parents use to take half of his salary every month....and left us with half....from which we had to pay rent, bills, house things, and every amount use to go like that.....and we lived hand to month life....basically living on pay check to pay check.......i didn't liked it....this was happening ever since i married and moved in with him....i don't know perhaps even before that.  I use to tell him if you wanted to give your parents money...i am not stopping you but do save some for yourself as well...so in future we don't have to ask from others.  But since I said earlier, he had too much trust on his family.....i don't know if he had ever considered me in his family or not...but for sure he didn't trusted me.  he even told me not to interfere in my financial matters.....when i deposite my money which i earned during the month of Nov. he got upset, because i didn't deposite it with him....i had my own account.

We've been back together since 2004. I moved in last march and we just had a baby this July!Things have changed since the baby arrived. It seems like he wont help out much with the baby related things. He helps out in alot of other ways. He just doesnt seem to understand that I need help with more. For one thing he didn't go to doctor visits, help  find a peditrician, find a hospital for where we were going to have the baby, birthing & breastfeeding classes, or even give me flowers the day I gave birth for 9 hours!! Tonight there was a fight over cleaning bottles. He said that "you didn't ask me to wash them." Is this something that I need to ask him to do? What would u ladies do? I love him, but please help
20061016082011AAaI5mx	Family & Relationships;Friends	Any suggestions for a best friend?	Ok I have this friend who's going thru her second divorce from the same man. Before knocking her intelligence  realize there are some people that are good con's and her soon to be ex is one of them. He made her believe he had changed and since they were apart for 7 months she felt he meant it and took him back. She's in her 20's,she's attractive, has a education, full time job, no children, and is going thru this stage where just hanging out with female friends is not enough if you know what I mean. Shes' not into the bar scenes so where can a woman go to meet men, hopefully decent ones? She can't obviously make a commitment yet since the divorce is still in the process  but she shouldn't have to sit around the house in her spare time waiting for it to be done. It's normal I think to get lonely in her situation. She says she wonders if she'll ever find Mr. Right. So this has left her with some doubts of her future. She does realize not all men are like this though.

20061030085856AAyI6Ol	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My Fiancee went skinny dipping with two of his guy friends and three girls I don't know when I was out of town	About two weekends ago, I went out of town to visit my mom and my sisters. I called my fiancee on Saturday and he was going to a mutual friend of ours. So the next day I call him aroung 11am and ask him what he ended up doing last night, and he told me he and two of his friends and three girls went to our community pool aroung midnight and went skinny dipping!!!! When he told me that I hung up in his face and he didnt even call me back, like he had did nothing wrong. It has been about three weeks since this happened, and I feel like he thinks everything is ok but its not. How do I let him know that what he did still bothers me and I am not over it without causing a big mess again?

20061122073444AA5Q1pC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he or maybe not?	i have a friend and i have known him for a year but i realised recently that i like him as more than a friend. i tried to get his opinon by telling him that there is this guy i like and i wanted to tell him and he told me not to make the first move. i could no longer keep it to myself and told him and he said nothing really and never really spoke to me again about it he moved like he was trying to avoid it. i decided at that point to end the freindship cause i thought that he could not deal with it and this made him mad. I apologised for my actions and we seemed to be ok again.Thing is that there were times when he would hug me but on one occasion he kissed me on my neck when he hugged me and i was taken back off course this was before i told him but now he is politle but he avoids me like the plague he is always to busy to see me and he make me feel weird. I wonder did i scare him away, did he ever really like me or was it all in my head and i wonder now if i should consider it dead.

Okay, well there is this guy (of course) and he used to flirt with me nonstop, and I would flirt back. But then things started going a little too far and he said that he loved me(I donno if he was joking or not, but still) and I got freaked. Also, he had/has a girlfriend but it was a long distance thing so I don't think it was THAT seroius, but  I still COULD'T flirt with him without feeling guilty. Also, he was acting like a perv and he was stepping over my bounderies and invading my 'personal space' WAY too much, so I got fed up with him and told him to stop acting like a perv and to stop flirting with me because he had a girlfriend. He didn't really listen to me until I told him like, 25 times...but once he grasped that I was getting fed up with him, he stopped talking to me! Now he barely even talks to me and he seems to ignore me!! Now I think I'm starting to like him because he isn't a total perv anymore...but I acted like I hated him before so I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO NOW! HELP

Eu acho que o verdadeiro ciclo da vida está todo de trás pra frente.   Nós deveríamos morrer primeiro, nos livrar logo disso.   Daí viver num asilo, até ser chutado pra fora de lá por estar muito novo.   Ganhar um relógio de ouro e ir trabalhar.   Ent?o você trabalha 40 anos até ficar novo o bastante pra poder aproveitar sua aposentadoria.   Aí você curte tudo, bebe bastante álcool, faz festas e se prepara pra faculdade.   Você vai pro colégio, tem várias namoradas, vira crian?a, n?o tem nenhuma responsabilidade, se torna um bebezinho de colo, volta pro útero da m?e, passa seus últimos nove meses de vida flutuando....   E termina tudo com um ótimo orgasmo!!!   N?o seria perfeito?"      (Charles Chaplin)

Ontem (dia 07/04/2007) encontrei-me c/ uma mo?a; minha m?e já a conhece e entende que uma amizade entre nós seria o máximo tolerável e imp?s que nada mais do que isso poderá haver, porque, embora ela seja mto bonita de rosto, está acima do peso; talvez eu possa lhe convencer de que minhas chances de namoro com ela sejam melhores do que se fosse c/ outra c/ um corpo em forma, porque esta estaria + sujeita a me abandonar quando se deparasse com alguém que ela considere à altura de seus padr?es de exigência no quesito beleza corporal. Tive que terminar meu último namoro em junho de 2006 por imposi??o de minha família, para n?o ser futuramente acusado e condenado por trai??o. Depois de longos 10 meses com crises de baixa auto-estima por n?o ter conseguido nenhum sucesso com mulher nenhuma, estaria eu sujeito a passar por novo momento de dor que senti quando tive que terminar meu último relacionamento? Dor como aquela eu n?o desejo a ninguém. Será que tudo vai come?ar de novo?

Um deles é meu colega de faculdade o outro já está no último ano.   Adoro-os.   Na semana passada o que n é meu colega conversou cmg aqui no msn, e pediu-me um beijo.   Ele é um bom amigo, me liga com frequência durante a semana e manda mtas piadinhas pro meu celular. Mas nunca se tinha mostrado interessado em mim. Por isso fiquei boba com o pedido de beijo.   Bom durante a semana, encontrei com ele na faculdade, mas cumprimentava-me com certa reserva... e eu também a ele. Porque n?o sabia como reagir.   Mas ao telefone o assunto de beijo voltava. Eu dizia pra ele nem tentar, e ele me dizia que preferia arriscar...   Na 6afeira nós saímos pro cinema, pela 1a vez sem o primo dele.   Rimos mto, mas n?o falamos do beijo.   Depois ele me levou pra uma esplanada e ficamos lá umas 2 horas conversando.   Beijo... nada!   Tudo o que fez foi criticar a cor do esmalte do meu pé.   Nessa noite me ligou e ontem tb.      Fico confusa...

E passeamos s uma vez. Eu tenho 39 anos, ele 41 e somos divorciados. Mas o que me aflige  que eu estou sendo preconceituosa demais com ele e n?o estou conseguindo me controlar nisso. Estou  chorando muito de arrependimento ao pensar que terminei com ele ontem,por mero impulso e preconceito.  A gota d'gua  que amos viajar. Furou, e ele se comportou como se tanto fizesse viajar, ou nao. Pareceu pouco caso dele, comigo, j que ele n?o tocou no assunto da viagem . Muito menos prop?s algum passeio. Fiquei muito p. da vida, com ele e terminei.  Ele  muito carinhoso comigo, me liga todo dia, e  bom de cama.   Mas ...  acomodado em vrios sentidos: nao gosta de sair. E ganha pouco, n?o se veste bem. N?o se interessa em modificar essa situa??o financeira dele. N?o  culto.  Mas me faz bem.  N?o t? conseguindo controlar essa minha falta de aceita??o do jeito dele ser . Mas queria controlar isso. Algum tem dica pra ajudar a mudar isso? Grata!

Por que um cara termina tudo e fica ligando "como amigo" pra saber como estou e p/ ouvir minha voz?   Ele falava que a gente estava junto, me pegava na faculdade duas vezes na semana (mas nunca paravamos nem para papo ou para um lanche) ent?o, depois de dois meses eu falei com ele, sobre a ausencia, apesar de falar varias vezes ao dia era estranho nao ficarmos juntos de verdade. Ele terminou comigo por e-mail, mas eu nem sei o que foi esse relacionamento doido.   Conhecemos a familia um do outro,mas era tudo escondido, nao sei se era esse o medo dele. Agora ele me liga uma vez ou duas por semana, mas me confunde muito. Eu gosto dele, mas me amo, só queria entender pq os homens pensam assim. Homens, uma dica aí? Meninas, vcs já passaram por algo parecido? O que fizeram?   Eu tenho 1,73, cabelos no meiodas costas, castanhos, um pouco ondulados, nao vejo pq ter vergonha de mim. Ontem o vi com uma loira gordinha e bonita, e ele "falou comigo"      Desde já... valeu galera!      Abra??o.

Gostaria de conhecer a vis?o de vocês sobre as mulheres que, ao identificar o “alvo de seu interesse”, investem em uma aproxima??o (direta ou indireta). é pura quest?o de saber o que se deseja e colocar uma “estratégia de flerte” em prática. Percebam que esse papel normalmente é reservado aos homens. Imaginem, por exemplo, um homem e uma mulher se observando mutuamente em um barzinho. Cada um em sua própria mesa. Para ilustrar minha pergunta, essa mulher se levanta e senta na mesa dele, tendo até mesmo uma “cantada” na ponta da língua. O que acham disso? Os homens vêem essa possibilidade com naturalidade e bons olhos ou n?o? Vocês acreditam que durante a paquera o direito à iniciativa é igual a ambos os sexos? Comentem.

20070420005500AALpW2r	Family & Relationships;Family	"Absent Father" calling to talk to child in the middle of the night?	I have posted questions before regarding my soon to be ex husband and our 3 yr old daughter....For a while he would only called once every couple of weeks, now he calls a few times a week but it is always around 2 am or 3 am my time (I live on the West Coast, he lives on the East Coast).  When I do actually answer the phone, he insists on me waking her and letting her talk to him.  I've stressed to him that he needs to call at a later time, but he feels that since it is about 6 am his time, I should "get over it" and "go get his kid out of bed".  I do not mind at all if he wants to talk with her, but now he is saying that he can use this against me in court when we begin our divorce and custody hearings.  And for the times I did not answer the phone at all, he says he can claim that I am keeping her from him.  I honestly feel that he is full of it, but this is getting annoying.  I have current phone records to prove how early he is calling.  How should I handle this????

20070314225741AAxEqK7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Noone has ever come to making me as happy as the man Im with now. We have been together for about 1 1/2 now.?	He is amazingly sweet, funny, caring, thoughtful, helpful, and just pretty much my absolute perfect. He makes me feel special. We do have one problem though. He has these moods swings. Once in a great while he gets extremely upset about some silly little thing. Once he gets worked up; he becomes extremely erratic and kinda scary. Hes never touched me; but he has threatened to hurt himself in more than one way. Hes even held a knife to his leg and asked me if I wanted to see him do it. I try to talk to him and point out his actions when hes like this; but its like he cant hear me. Its realy scary. I have anxiety attacks and when I start crying he'll stop being angry and cry with me. He says he's so sorry and doesnt know why he gets this way and he wont do it again. I love this man with ALL my heart and soul. I dont know what to do. Hes said that hes tried therapy and it doesnt work. I dont want to leave him but I dont know how to help him. What should I do?

20070215065331AABnAnl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	We've beem together 7 yrs. and I never cheated, I am a good girlfriend, yet he doesn't trust me. Why????	We've been together 7 years and I have never cheated on him or anything like that. He doesn't trust me at all. Everytime I leave the house he knows my where I am if he calls my phone once and I don't answer he thinks I'm being unfaithful. If I tell him I want to hang out with my friends he says ok but when I get home he has a fit. I do everything for him cook clean wash his clothes take care of the baby and go to work. I just don't understand why after all this he does not trust me. I understand that sometimes people need alone time or if he doesn't answer his phone my 1st thought is maybe he is busy or has no reception (nextel) but those situations are out of the question when it comes to me. I love him to death and I don't doubt he loves me but I don't know what to do.We don't have sex that often (Fri. Sat. and Sun.) which may be the problem but if I try to give it to him more then he questions me about it so I can't win it's always a lose-lose for me. HELP!!!

Could we do this some other time?" So I said "Okay" because I was in shock.       After that we still talked online on AIM, sometimes we'd talk for hours like 3 or 4 at a time. And we'd tell each other personal stuff. Then we starte to talk less (which was okay, 4 hours is a long time). Then 1 day a friend of mine said he has a new GF from his camp, but he told me on AIM that this girl wasn't his GF just his friend (I didn't really ask him though, her name just popped up, he said "Oh don't worry she's not my GF).    After the whole other girl thing, it seemed we were talking less and less. Soon he only talked to me to find out the homework for that night. Now when I try to IM him he doesn't even respond to me! What does this mean?

20070510194442AAY9CnG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I know if he likes me?	I like this guy who works at the gym I go too. We've talked twice, the first time we talked he was really sweet. He asked me when my birthday was, what kind of car I wanted to get, etc. He also found out that I was fifteen (He's seventeen), I liked him way before that but I was always too shy to talk to him, well I got over it and made the first move. He hasn't really talked to me since, he waves and everything but he never comes up and talks to me. I work out with my mother so I wonder if maybe he's nervous to talk to me when I'm with her. Sometimes I'd go and I'd be feeling really self-conscious so I'd kind of ignore him and maybe he noticed? The last time I talked to him which was a week ago, he said "hey, whats up?" and I asked if he went to prom and you get the point. How do I know if he likes me?

Sempre amei ela, agora tudo aquilo voltou na minha mente... Agora ela se afastou de novo um pouco de mim, ela diz que por enquanto n?o quer mais ficar comigo, ela diz que n?o sabe... Ela terminou um namoro faz pouco tempo, ta com a cabe?a muito confusa...

She want to study abroad and I didn't want her to study abroad. I'm going to miss her very much. She's the only girl I deeply love and only love in my life. She's the very first girl I felt this way about. She's going to Japan for a semester. I'm going really heartbroken that I can't see her everyday after she goes to Japan. I'm going to miss the physical intimacy that we share. I care so much about her and think about her daily. She means the world to me. When she went back to her hometown in the winter for a week, I missed her so much.

20090205113815AAnk973	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is my friend asking for trouble?	My friend (male) sent me a long IM saying his life was hell, he wanted to go live in the woods alone and needed time to get his life together, bla bla bla  then logged off.  Kind of weird and dramatic.      I hadn't talked to me friend for a couple of weeks.  Yesterday he pops up happy as a clam. Apparently before he did his dramatic "woe is me" act, he met a woman.     She's married   She's been living in a motel (apart from her husband) for a couple mnths   She says her husband abused her 3 times in 5 years   She wants to go back with him   She had sex with my friend on their 3rd date (their first date was at his house, fooling around)   She claims every man in her life has forced her to have sex within 10 minutes of meeting (I asked if she was saying she'd been raped?)   She's supposedly in counseling.      I said to my friend-- do you not think it's wrong to get involved with a married woman who sounds emotionally damaged??   He said "but I haven't had sex in a year!"   I realized this guy ( my friend) must be a total idiot, but he sees nothing wrong with her/her situation.   Thoughts?

20090205122643AA7aLmT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls: If Your Boyfriend Was Like This?	Okay, So me and my boyfriend have been dating almost 11 months. We'll be together a year in March. March 28th to be exact! Well, It's almost as if he doesn't want to do anything for me or with me and it's almost to the point where I'm so confused and don't know what to do. =( I mean I know i'm happy with him but there's also a part of me that's longing for so much more because i feel like i deserve SO much more! Like he didn't get me a birthday or Christmas gift. It's Valentine's Day and he told me he didn't want to come over and spend the night because he was going to be working that whole day and he wanted to get some rest... My point is i do so much for him and it's like he can't even do half of that for me! I just don't get it. I know he loves me but why can't he show it? I know love isn't about material items and I've learned to respect that he can't go and spend large amounts of money on me but why must he be like this? All i ask is for simple things. What's your opinion?
20090205121903AA3ierm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Any ideas on how to have this party?	The party would be a passion/tattoo/male entertainment party foe men and women. The passion and entertainment for the women, and the tattoos for the males.      Passion: A representative comes to the location of the party and display/sell what ever product they would sell in a adult store.      Tattoo: You would be able to go to a separate section of the party that would be closed off to get a tattoo of your choice.      Male Entertainment: "That's self explanatory"          The thing is there are a few of my church members who want to come, but only want to participate in the passion side. There are other who are not in the church who wants all 3. Last, there are a few church members who said they know how to leave when they don't to participate in something because they would not want to be the reason why everyone can't come and participate in the section you want to.      How do you fix this so everyone can be on the same page?

Will the fact that both partners come from such radically different parts of the world provide many difficulties for the two, leaving them unable to remain together or will such difficulties only strengthen the relationship?      Btw, im talking about two completely different ethnicities that come from different cultures. Not something like a black man and a white woman. Both are still grown as Americans... unless the man is truly from Africa or the girl is truly from Europe.

20090205120709AARPAnl	Family & Relationships;Friends	College friends make me feel  left out :(?	I wouldnt call them friends, there just people who i hang out with in college.    Theres two girls who i hang out with in college, i will just use names cos its easier, so theres amy and jess. They leave me out, its like they dont even notice im with them sometimes. however at lunch sometimes amy meets her old friends she knows from school, that jess doesnt know, and she will leave jess out 2, she wont speak to either of us, when her friends are there.    I would say jess is ok, when its just me and her, but when amy is with her ,, they just leave me out. When its just me and amy, she barley makes the effort to talk with me, i dont know why, im a nice chatty person, i dont know what her problem is.   Also when were all around each other and have conversation, they dont make eye contacct with me, just each other. They mess around all the time, but dont include me in anything, or let me join in there convo, iv tried joining in, but it doesnt really work   One day i got feed up, i walked behind them, and once i walked ahead, and instead of holiding the door open for amy, i just didnt bother. I thought shed get the hint, something was wrong, but she never, she just blanked me   My real friends are in different days to me, so i cant meet up with them for lunch and that. Theres noone else in my course hu id talk to, apart from them two girls   what should i do, i hate getting left out

20090205104150AAljg34	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think it's wrong to cheat?	Okay, don’t judge.  The first question I posted got a lot of rude comments about me and my family, and if you’re going to do that, do it on another question, I don’t want to hear what you have to say.        I’ve been married since I was twenty two, and I have a beautiful daughter (best friend) Destiny Faye who is fifteen.  I’m thirty two years old and I love my husband very much.  When we moved to New Jersey I joined a book club to make new friends.  And there, I met someone else I love very much.  Her name is Lissa Marie Roberts and she’s twenty nine and a student studying to be a teacher,  We were reading the Nicholas Parks book “The Lucky One” when we met.  I’ve always considered myself bi so I was not surprised when I found myself attracted to Lissa.  One day when we were hottubbing at her apartment I told her how I felt about her.  She said that she’d never been with a woman before, but that she felt the same way.  I was extatic and our relationship seemed to go on the fast track.  I’m I realitor so I’d go to her place between almost every showing, and then be home for dinner every night with Peter and Destiny Faye.  Although I really do love Peter, I have these feelings for LIssa Marie that I also love peter.  (One time, for Peter’s birthday, we pretended Lissa was a hooker so we could have a threesome!!)  Either way, people tell me it’s wrong to cheat, but in this situation.. where I am deeply in love with both and not just in a midlife crisis, do you think it’s wrong?      Thanks.   -Phoenix.

And i had a conversation whit a guy and realize that he's FORTY!      DoradoGate:   Impossible! Where on a global warming.          ShadowBreaker9867:   Yeah it′s true this is impossible..unless god wants to make the earth into a snowball       srikanthpm :   True. If God existed he/she would.    ShadowBreaker9867:    Since he does.He wouldnt.       srikanthpm:    Well the snowball Earth did happen there's more than enough physical proof of that, which proves God is a myth. YouTube "Chistopher Hitchens" and you'll see what I mean:)          ShadowBreaker9867:   I actually dont want to knwo what you mean,If god created the earth,us,animals and the whole universe.I honsetly cant belive? that it was just created by a giant boom?   What proof is theyre? My proof is the bible.   generations when the lord told moses about adam and eve.The Lord did make a snowball earth,The ice age.But animals had the choice to go south.and they have fur.But evolution is a myth.Are you going to belive that you came from a monkey?    srikanthpm :   God didn't do any of that either. The proof is the ice core research that has been done and many other studies that have been carried out. Just realized you are too young for me to be arguing with. The way humans behave especially the ones that quote "God's word", it's not tough to see how we could have come from monkeys:)          ShadowBreaker9867: Oh jees im fighting whit a forty year old man!. Oh no im so scared.Just freaken end it.       srikanthpm:   yeah. Pray to god that will help. You're better off burying your head in the sand. If god can't help Satan can. Also, learn to spell sweety that may help you earn a living later in life.       ShadowBreaker9867:    Dude,if your like fourty,shouldnt you like have a life,a job, a family? other than talking to sixteen year old girls that belive in god?       srikanthpm :   some of us are smart enough to do all of that without a sweat.       ShadowBreaker9867:   Well sorry, xP   My dad is also fourty,but he happily has a life.          srikanthpm :   I'd love to discuss this with your dad. He can't have much of a life if he believes in something that does not.               WHY WAS A FORTY YEAR OLD IN YOUTUBE DISCUSSING MAN KIND WHIT ME???         It's like, the internet is for information, which is for school! which is for younger people, myspace;young people!,YOUTUBE: YOUNG PEOPLE!      Some sites could be for old people but i think they should spent their time whit their family and their job..      I mean 30 year old newly weds can still go to the internet and junk..      But FORTY? c'mon! that's just plain creepy!

If you see your step mom just running all over your dad, what would you do?   I know the logical response is just to keep my mouth shut, mind my own business... and that's what I've been doing so far, and it's tough!!!      Basically, this is his 3rd wife... he's 49, she's 29... she immigrated here (America) from Vietnam on a fiance visa. He met her there on a business trip. Well now that she's here, she doesn't work (and she can work now, she has a permit), she doesn't help out around the house, whenever I come to visit she's always in pajamas just laying around... and then on top of it, she has such a cold personality, she never has anything nice to say, she always complains, and I've notice her taste has gotten quite expensive (Coach bags, dept store makeup, etc.) my dad thinks she's the best thing ever and he WONT shut up about her... and honestly it just makes me sick.      Has anyone else gone through something similar and had to keep their mouth shut?      I so so badly want to say something to him and tell him to open his eyes, but I know it will just cause more trouble.
20090205104217AADeQqG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why dont she love me? I am in love from 8 year..help please?	Here is a long story: I am sorry      Me and a girl met in college around 8 years back and studied 2gthr for 4 years we were just classmates with fine relations. We joined the same company in same city but didn’t meet much for 2 years, not much of calls just once in a while.      I was in love with her from college 1st year. She had a boyfriend in college so I never thought in that way and suppressed my feelings all the time. I never knew they broke up after college. I know the guy well he was also my classmate.       We passed college in 2005 and did not met much till 2007. Then we started meeting once in month or may be twice sometimes for 6-7 months. I was insanely in love with her from past so many years but never let her know. Finally my manager from job told me to go to USA in Oct 07 and as I have to leave I thought of proposing her and so I did, she said no and didn’t give any reason. Now its Feb 09 I talk to her every weekend sometimes she doesn’t pick up the phone as she in office. But sometimes when I don’t call for 2-3 week and she gives me a call back. I asked her again few months back abt we getting together she was not ready. She doesn’t love me (I think), but like as a friend.       I am not sure what to do? I am madly in love with her from 8 years and have never dreamed abt my life without her. I am in USA and she is in India I will be going back in Oct 09.

20070826001318AAMcRhx	Family & Relationships;Friends	Fui bonzinho demais! Agora vou descontar tudo nos outros. Alguém pensa assim?	Quantas vezes a gente pensa em ser bondoso com o próximo, pensar em fazer o bem sem ver a quem estamos fazendo o bem e essa pessoa percebe que estamos com boas inten??es e sobem na gente! Aproveitam da situa??o e falam mal da gente pelas costas.      Sabe quando a gente está com boas inten??es e as pessoas n?o entendem e ficam irritado com a gente.      Eu chego lá, fico cheio de cuidados com as garotas e elas quase que me chamam de v****.      P**** eu estava com boas inten??es mas ninguém entende. N?o podemos ser t?o bondosos assim.      Espero poder mudar, dessa vez chega de ser bonzinho. A gente só se ferra pensando assim.      Dá vontade de me vingar dessas pessoas, agora agindo de um jeito bem macho do jeito como todo mundo gosta. Agredindo o mendingo na rua, pegando o dinheiro do próximo e n?o devolver, agindo que nem um Joselito (aquele da MTV)      Ah tá certo que eu n?o penso assim, mas as vezes fico na vontade! Quem n?o passou por algo assim?

Elas choram quando est?o felizes.    E riem quando est?o nervosas.       Elas brigam por aquilo que acreditam.    Elas levantam-se para injusti?a.    Elas n?o levam "n?o" como resposta quando acreditam que existe melhor    solu??o.       Elas andam sem novos sapatos para suas crian?as poderem tê-los.    Elas v?o ao médico com uma amiga assustada.    Elas amam incondicionalmente.       Seus cora??es quebram quando seus amigos morrem.    Elas lamentam-se com a perda de um membro da família, contudo s?o fortes    quando elas pensam que n?o há mais for?a.    Elas sabem que um abra?o e um beijo podem curar um cora??o quebrado.    O cora??o de uma mulher é o que faz o mundo girar!       Mulheres fazem mais do que dar a vida.    Elas trazem alegria e esperan?a.    Elas d?o compaix?o e ideais.    Elas d?o apoio moral para sua família e amigos.    Mulheres têm muito a dizer e muito a dar.

20090205121641AA4TBsZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does she like me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?	I really liked this girl but could never tell her because my best mate liked her. We got talking more and more and i knew i really liked her, my best still liked her at this point and had done for a long time although i knew she dint like him. When he wanted to ask her out i helped him do it although it was quite depressing and she said yes.      as their relationship went on they became more and more distant and it only lasted a week. She said she didnt like him and that she liked me and thats why had ended it. We got more and more close but i couldnt ask her out because my best mate was still depressed over it.      she eventually told him why she dumped him as he was nagging. and then he started to get all bitter with me , even though in my view it wasnt my fault. So to stop me and my best friend from falling out i didnt ask her and because of this we became distant.. i went out with someone else to get over it but never really did and she went out with someone      after we'd both ended the relationships she told me that shed still liked me the whole time and that id upset her by going out with someone. and i told her that i had been thnking about her the whole time (which i had) and a while ago i said i still liked her but she said she wasnt sure but she said '' i will probs starting you soon ''         and now shes been closer to me and when i asked her who she fancied she said '' i dno , im not sure if i like them fully or not yet'' does that mean that there might be a chance still?

20090205113928AAHAfMV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Really need some advise what should i do ￡8 though paypal for the best answer honest answers please?	i really like this girl and i asked her out by text 3 weeks ago on saturday (i had my reasons of asking her out by text, she replyed saying i really like you as a mate and enjoy you company because we are mates and think its best if it stays that way, and that she feels she doesnt have to act up infront of me is that ok i replyed saying its completly ok. anyway i have accepted it and have moved on and want to remain very good freinds with her ( we were very good freinds before i asked her out) anyway since i asked her out she had been texting me less, anyway i invided her down to mine 2 weeks ago on a thursday and she came and everythink seemed the same and she and we got on, however both of us didnt mention me asking her out which im not sure if i should, anyway she brought some ps2 games of ebay and i said i had a ps2 game i had somewere but coudnt find anyway she left and the next day i was down my brothers and found the game and said i would pop it down for her she replyed saying shes going out so to pop it though the letter box. i couldnt because i was almost home by this time and said that i might be able to do it 2moro night as going out 2moro night so can pop it around then. anyway the next day both her other 2 games arrived and i sent her a text telling her i might be able to bring thm down that night at about 6 if not id give them 2 her when i see her next, which i couldnt in the end, that same night she invited me down to hers on the monday, which i said yes, but ended up getting the games to her on sunday as left them with her mum. anyway i went around hers on monday and a freind of both are (james) was also there everythink was alright to begin with although not once had she said thanks for me bringing the games down to her and she owed me a few pounds on the games as she went over by a few pounds, anyway i was getting quite a few texts from a new freind who id started dating, and after a while she said lets go upstairs and for me to bring my laptop, (james also brought his upstairs) anyway after a while she said who am i texting i said oww just someone i know, (i didnt want to tell her as id asked her out 2 weeks ago and didnt want to say oww someone im dating) anyway me and rich were on are laptops and i gave her and james a thing they asked me to download for them anyway james said thanks and again she said nothing and didnt say thanks, anyway i started to watch a bit of lost (new season 5 yeaaaa) after she asked me about the text messages she got real funny and said to both me and james "youve both put me of getting laptops because i dont want to turn out like you two". then she tunrned around to me and said why did you come around mine if all you gonna do is watch lost, you could have done that at your house, then she followed by saying oww looks like james is the only one having fun here it all was aimed at me she then said shes going of to do some cleaning and stomped out the room. i mean whats going on she invited me down to her and ended up playing grand theft auto while i watched and i didnt get a go and then she says bring up my laptop upstairs and didnt invite me and james to do anythink or come up with some thinks to do i mean she is the host, and she didnt even ask me if i would like somethink to drink or eat (i always ask her if she would like somethink to drink) and then she turns around and says those things to me, what did i do to her, is she funny because i asked her out, is it because i had lots of texts when i was around hers this time which i never used to before i asked her out and then she asked who am i texting. why would she get funny over this, she did seem to get angry when after i said i was texting someone i know. im soo confused because i just want to be freinds with her now. what should i do now, i have to say the truth i still would like to be more than friends with her but ive got over it and just want to be friends and now she is actin like this its kinda upset me. anyway on last wensdays i go to this photography coarse, last wensday after the monday when i whent over hers on the way back from the course she was talking to me like normal and didnt mention the monday however when we got back to her house she didnt invite me which she always does on wensdays and said i dont know when ill see you text me and ill see if im free. since then i havent seen her and its now thursday 8 days since the photography course, and she hasnt text me, ive text her a few times and asked whats she up to she has replyed, but has never sent me a text first, last friday i said if she would like to meet up on sunday which she couldnt but said i we could meet up monday, anyway i came down with food poisoning on saturday and still felt a little rough on the saturday and sent her a text saying couldnt do monday  how about tuesday she replyed saying cant, meeting ova friends tuesday soz. since then i havent text her and she hasnt text me and its now thursday, what do you think of this

Okay, so My ex boyfriend Tommy is telling me that he loves me  but he can't make up his mind about what he wants. The other day at his job, i was there cause i had job videos to watch and he was sitting by his ex girlfriend Sheryl. He never said one thing to me and then i was told he called me a few names. I need to know if u think he really loves me or not. He says he does but i really just need to know the truth or what you think. Please help me
20090205122626AAvelWQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I still do it?  (Long)?	OK, so there's this girl that I work with at Publix, and we're both 18. She's gorgeous, friendly, funny, everything I could ever hope for in a girl.      After a couple of months of working together, we became pretty good friends. I eventually asked her for her number, saying...   "Hey, let me get your number. You know, so I can annoy you whenever I want to."   "(Laughs and gives number) Now, you have to give me your number, so I can annoy you back."      A few days later, while I was working and she wasn't, I played a joke on her through text message. She told me, "Haha, your so mean! But I still love you!" Then later on, she came into work and jokingly hit me on the back, telling me how "mean" I am. As she left, she made her mom stop the car so that she could yell "BYE (My name)" out the window. Another worker that was nearby told me, "Man, you're so lucky. She definitely likes you." Oddly enough, that same day after I got off work I went to the mall with a friend, she was there. She saw me, and ran up and hugged me so hard it nearly knocked me over. That night, we were having a good conversation through text messaging.      The next day, I tried texting her again, but her responses were really bland and uninterested. Almost as if I were annoying her.      About a week later, there was a concert coming up so I invited her to come along with a friend and I. She said she couldn't, because she was going to be at her dad's house. (Seems like an odd excuse to me. :/ )      A couple weeks after that, I was in the aisles of Publix, stocking shelves, when she came back and started talking to me for a while. Then she said she was leaving, gave me a hug, and left. When I finished stocking, a friend of mine asked,   "Hey, are you and (the girl I'm talking about) going out?"   "No, why?"   "When I asked her what she was doing, she said she was looking for someone. Then she walked back to where you were. She likes you, man." (Note: This is a different friend than the one that was convinced she liked me before.)      However, the other day I offered to give her a ride home (she can't drive yet), and she said that she didn't need one.      About a week later, she mentioned,   "Man, I hope I don't have to walk home in this cold."   "Oh, I can give you a ride home if you want."   "No, that's okay. I have a ride, I just hope it doesn't cancel."      Just yesterday, I was completely sure I was going to ask her out, and I was ready to do it, but ironically enough some guy that she knows from school goes through her line and starts hitting on her. She's obviously uninterested in him to the point that she seemed upset that he was there, and he leaves dejectedly. Now, she's obviously frustrated, and goes on to tell me a story about another guy from work asking her out and how she keeps trying to avoid him now because she doesn't want to go out with him.  It was an awkward time to ask her on a date, so I didn't.      We're good friends, and we're always hanging out and talking to each other at work, and I've gotten to the point where I can't stop thinking about her.      She has my number, but has only texted me without me texting her first a couple times. I've texted her a few times, but I don't do it a whole lot so I don't seem desperate.      Now, I don't know if I should ask her out or not. I mean, she has sort of diverted my advances already, and she said she was tired of guys asking her out on dates. But she's given me all the signs that she's interested in me, and I'm crazy about her.      So what should I do?      Thanks you for all your help! :)

20070904124655AAyILfT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should i do?	I have/had a crush on a guy at work. The thing is we used be close friends and I started liking him as more than a friend and I told hm . I got the since that he liked me too since he always flirted with me and cracked jokes, etc. But, he has a gf in the Phillipines whom he is engaged 2 since I helped him get the ring for her. He only gets to go back there once every 2 years and I think we started experiencing sexual tension since we had a convo about doing it. I called him a dog since I thought he was comin on to me but then he denied he was serious bout it and said he was kidding. Iwrote a letter apologizing to him but then he started ignoring me. He said I should focus on someone else and it's best that we no longer be friends since I was 2 weird & obsessive bout him. I emailed him saying that we were both wrong for talking about sex, he blamed me for being weird. i got mad and told him not to b my friend. he told me not to talk 2 him unless work related. i'm ignorn him.

She always uses big words and I feel stupid talking to her, but then I feel bad when I get angry because you can tell that she's not doing it for that purpose; she just really doesn't know how to relate to people. What do I do? She's really nice, but it's so awkward being around her because we have nothing in common and nothing to talk about.

I asked who she was and he claims that he was trying to set her up with a friend. But he seemed weird about it so I said, well, what did you say to her? And he admits he didn't want to show me because they were flirtatious in a way (he said he called her beautiful in one) - and I know he's a flirty guy. He admitted this and said there was absolutely nothing going on. What do you think I should believe? I just didn't think it was right for him to do that.

But today it feels uncomfortable to walk and i need to sit funny so it doesn't hurt. Is this really every womans fantasy? I am 16 years old so is there any chance my vagina could stretch?

20090205124026AA4UBOm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is my boyfriend is being like this to me?	ok me and my boyfriend have been together for 4years. we met when we were both freshmans and now we're both in senior year.   we always get along really good, but once in a while we will have a little disagreement. after school every day i ride the bus home with him or he rides home with me.    well theres this other girl on his bus thats a grade younger than us and i think she really likes him even though she knows hes with me!!   me and her are not friends. but i think my boyfriend is friends with her.   she gets off at the same stop as he does and we all walk home together cause she lives right across the street from him.    whenever we're walking my boyfriend always ignores me and just talks to her. he wont hold my hand or anything so i just walk behind them and i can never hear what their talking about. ugh sometimes he does talk to me though when we are with her. it wont be nice though. he will say things like um why the hell are u following us? and then they will both laugh and start talking kinda quietly.    when we get to his house everything will be fine again though.   we will watch a movie and make something to eat.    im not a virgin and neither is he but the last time we did it was like a few months ago. we will do everything except that. and its not that i dont wanna do it, cos i do.   i dont think hes cheating on me with that girl cos she aready has a boyfriend who shes been with for 7 months.   why do u think hes rude to me when were around her though?   i dont get it, i dont do anything mean to him.

20090205121852AAfXUvP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can i have your advice?	ive known this boy, we'll call him nick for about a year. we went out but after a week, i broke up with him. over the summer we always would hang out, i told him i liked him and he asked me out.  we both fell in love with eachother. we didnt go to the same school but about 2-3 times a week we would see eachother. we were basicly bf/gf and bestfriends. a couple days before our 5 month anniversary he broke up saying he didnt love me anymore. my friends and i ran into him about a month after. he texted me saying he was confused. then he asked me out. we never saw eachother and after 1 week, he broke up again with me.  right away he started going out with a slut. i have another guy who really likes me, but i still love my ex. any advice?
20090205114347AAUQ6nG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I split up with him?	I have been with my boyfriend for 7 years, and I have been feeling for a long time that we have become just friends. He is my first boyfriend and nothing like what I imagined I would be with, quite the opposite in fact. I don't think I have ever felt head over heels in love with him, he was a friend to begin with who became something more. But I don't know whether to break up with or not, I mean I am not desperately unhappy with him and we have a good time together its just any "sexy time" is not happening at the moment and I am trying to do the decent thing and split up with him before one of us ends up cheating on the other. I have attempted to have a chat with him but he doesn't understand and thinks that I should work at it and not be so quick to throw away what we have built up together over the last 7 years, but I am not so sure. What would you do? How do you find the strength to leave someone who is your best friend....? It kills me to see him so hurt and I have to admit I am scared of facing single life again. I am 29 and would have to start again and would need to find somewhere to live. What shall I do?

20090205124818AAVS8oU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He destroyed me and now I can't go on?!?!?	I had been seeing this guy for the past 3 months. for awhile things were going good...he had a few trust issues but things seemed to play out alright. anyways...i was pretty much in love with him...we had been together a couple times. then he started acting really . strange...he started acting distant and sort of blowing me off...and then pulling me back in when he wanted. then when things got better with us..he kept saying we were "just friends" basically right after we slept together. this was really strange to me so...i told him i needed space and didnt want to see him for awhile so my feelings for him could fade. that didnt go over too well at all. he got really hostile and wouldnt even talk to me when i tried to call him. when i did get ahold of him hed get really angry. one time i apologized and he came into my work..and sort of tried to talk to me. the next few days he seemed REALLY distant. and then i find out when i call him this week hes been seeing someone else for the past month...and that its over between us and we cant talk anymore. his words were im seeing someone i "really like" and you need to move on with things. apparantly this is a pattern that has happened in the past i found out from his sister, but i found out too late. i am feeling like i shouldnt have pushed him away like this and then he wouldnt have done it. and that its me. and now im SO insanely jealous of this new girl. hes probably way nicer to her.. i couldnt even sleep the night i found out...and i can barely take a shower. can anyone help me please????

20090205104835AAnC95Y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I think I screwed up - could use guy opinion?	I have been friends with a guy I met here in the US.  He lives in the UK.  We kept in touch via email/text over the past 5 months about every 2 weeks.        We just started having phone conversations - 2 calls.  First lasted 1 hour.  The next was 2 hours.  I am in the midst of separating from my partner but haven't told the brit yet. The call got flirty and I asked if I wasn't involved would he be interested in me - he said yes I am attractive.  Said he promised to come to the states and see me.  In fact on during that very phone call he was in the US and tried to get a connection to my state but couldn't. He also said he was shy and doesn't like to approach women, reveal feelings, He's 38 and single, etc.        So after call --here's where I screwed up   I texted him the next day to say have a nice trip, then I emailed him a funny email 3 days later..      This is where I nailed the coffin shut - Then yesterday I called him to ask him something we discussed previously.  His phone was off and went straight to voicemail.        It has been nearly 2 weeks since last call which isn't that long but he didn't respond to the email (which was funny) or the text.  What do you think?  I am so mad at myself for feeling insecure.  Would a guy go from hot to cold that fast ?No he isn't married.

20090205125027AAJFwLo	Family & Relationships;Friends	Mutual breakup~is IT this hard?	My bf & I agreed we were done a few days ago. Before he left, he agreed our relationship is emotionally exhausting but because we have a 4yr old daughter he said it was going to be tough to leave. So in other words, if it wasnt for her, we wouldnt have been in a relationship this long?!  After he left, he didnt call that whole day & I was fine with that. The next day he calls to say pleeease! lets not do this, up to this day hes asking me why I enjoy making him suffer/ breaking his heart? and if Im allowing my parents to influence my view on our relationship. My parents were ok with him in the beginning of our relationship but he did something to me while he was drunk a long time ago & was advised to stay away from himwhich I didnt for the hopes of having what I truly wanted. So I repeated myself to tell him again I feel were in an unhealthy relationship, I cannot communicate with you without worrying about your reactions and we just dont click! Because he would threaten to leave us (repeatedly) up until last month, I became aware that I checked myself out of the relationship.  Of course I still love him & hope he finds strength to move on as well, I am not in love with him...I hurt because my daughter is daddys girl (when she talked to him on the phone last night, she held back tears telling him come home daddy) and because even though we dont see eye to eye, I truly wanted the 3 of us together forever. I know I have the will to move on to provide a healthy home& environment for my daughter. In the meantime, because all this doesn't feel so mutual & i'm blamed for not letting us be together...do I avoid all contact with him? Does this sound like Im doing the right thing?!     Thank you for taking the time to read this.

20070615033804AA4TfPs	Family & Relationships;Friends	“As muito feias que me perdoem, mas beleza é fundamental”. O poeta tinha raz?o?	Vivemos num mundo em que a sociedade dita padr?es de beleza, influenciando o comportamento humano. Muitas pessoas aficionadas em se enquadrar nesse modelo se esquecem de olhar para si e analisar realmente o que é mais importante na vida. Será que o melhor é ficar preso aos conceitos de beleza da sociedade?       Há muitas mulheres bonitas fisicamente que n?o conseguem a felicidade no amor (apesar de bela), na vida social, no trabalho e no lado espiritual. Também encontramos pessoas que n?o s?o belas (perante a sociedade), mas que s?o felizes no amor, na carreira e na vida social. Se beleza é fundamental, por que isso acontece?

He's about 55 years old and smokes crack atleast once a week. He's been divorced three times and lives with his mother who is in her 80s. He cuts the grass at our shop for $15.00 a week and does yard work at several other places up and down the street. The guy has absolutely nothing, but is one of the most positive, happy, christian people I know. Before he started crack, he had nothing, and if he stopped, he would still have nothing. If he can smoke crack and be fulfilled with the way he lives his life is it ok?
20070726225027AAPwzdY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How important is it for the guy to be the assertive one in a relationship?	I used to be pretty passive when it came to being with a guy...in having them ask me out, having them call me, having them pretty much initiate everything. Now, I tend to ask out guys whenever I feel strongly for someone, engage them in conversation if i want to enjoy their company, and share openly how i feel about them. Which way of doing things is more attractive to males? Is the mystery and challenge of the first option more alluring...or is the no-games, openly affectionate side better? I honestly dont know because i dont want to come on too strong and repulse anyone. I'm just afraid a guy wont like me back and then wont say anything so he'll just be bothered by me.

20071208235938AA3eOMI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Como resolver a situa??o?	Tenho 18 anos, estou namorando, minha namorada quer transar e eu quero transar. O problema? Na casa dela é impossível, porque só posso ir quando os pais estiverem e n?o há como fazer isso com eles lá. Ela n?o é do tipo que desobedeceria a m?e. Aqui, minha m?e quase sempre está em casa e isso a deixa (minha namorada) desconfortável, mesmo que seja possível. Como estou fazendo auto-escola, n?o tenho como levá-la ao Motel, e ela n?o gosta muito da idéia de ir de taxi ou algo do gênero. Além disso, nem mesmo pode ficar aqui até mais tarde, até quando meus pais forem dormir (porque ela tem que voltar de ?nibus ou de carona, aí n?o pode de madrugada).      Será que isso só vai se resolver quando eu tiver um carro? Ela é virgem, penso que talvez ela pode ter medo (mesmo afirmando que quer) e use isso como prote??o, mas acho que n?o é muito provável. Será que falta algum tipo de iniciativa minha? Porque ela n?o dá muitas brechas pra isso...

Should I say anything at all or just not respond to her calls or text messages? What would you do?

20081002180217AAN2zk6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Based on his actions, would you say that he likes me, or what?	Okay, so there's this boy. And I've been in his class forever, and in 3rd grade everyone knew I had a little-girl-crush on him. And he always sent "ambassadors" to make sure I still did. It was really annoying, so one time I just said, "I used to, but not anymore," and it was over. We never really were friends after that, just kind of there. Now we're in the 8th grade, and I think he likes me. So near the end of last year, he apparently told 2 of my my friends that he liked me. I don't know any details about it, only that it was on the last week of school and one of my friends who was there told me that he said so. I tried getting more details out of her, but she was getting annoyed. Anyway, now that it's been called to my attention, I'm starting to notice more and more "signs." Like, he constantly stares at me, and he's definitely tried to get closer to me in these past 2 or so months that school has been in. For example, he texts me every day, and seemed geniunely disappointed when my phone broke. He ALWAYS texted me first, and I'd text him back, never vice versa. Except for maybe 2 or 3 occassions when I would ask him the homework, and he'd tell me and I'd thank him, and he'd keep the conversation going. The texts were usually really flirty, and he always showed all of his friends that he was texting me, or if he wasn't with them at the time, he would show them the texts I sent him. He constantly brings up the fact that he was talking with me to his friends, too, almost as if he were proud of it. Also, our conversations would go for maybe 5 or so hours at a time, wtih maybe 3 minutes in between each text. Once I even asked him who he liked, and he said, "Good luck finding out. I like a lot of people, and flirt with even more." Was he saying this in all honesty, or was he trying to flirt with me or make me jealous? Also, he constantly makes fun of me about this boy who everyone knew I had a crush on last year, almost as if to see if I still like him or not. (The boy I liked still likes me, too, and to make matters worse, both boys are friends.) He talks to me more than necessary, and stares at me A LOT. Even when he talks to other people, he's staring at me as if to see what I think about what he said. (By the way, he's staring into my eyes, not at any other part of my body, which I like!) He never touches me. Like, he never tries to make physical contact, even brushing my arm. Also, when given the chance, he never sits next to me or stands by me. He will go by his friends, though, if they are close to me. (Actually, I'm more touchy-feely with his friends, who are also my friends) However, whenever I get people to ask him if he likes me, he always denies it. Is it because his friend also likes me, and it's the same for boys as it is girls (sisters before misters, bros before hos) ? Or is it because he's just, like, shy or embarrassed or something? I'm kind of starting to like him, too, but I don't know whether I should tell him or have someone tell him, or not. I was thinking about having one of my friends who is also kind of his friend say to him tomorrow, "Psst, Claire thinks you're cute. What do you think about that?" just to see his reaction. Do you think this is a good idea? Or would he take it too seriously (he is just a 13-year-old boy, after all) and become more attracted to me, or get scared of me? I just would like to know what everyone thinks, if he likes me or is he just some kind of.. boy?

But my friends think he's ugly. But that's not what i'm worried about. He might not be the greatest looking guy but he's so sweet and nice. He's slight awkward with his moments and all that but I find it adorable and his smile is absolutely amazing.   Would it be strange if we went out? Would he even want to go out with a freshmen?

20090205094727AA7UVJp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need help with wanting sex!!?	My bf and i have been together on and off for 9 years.  but going strong now for 2. we have had some up and downs in our relationship but seem to be on the right path now.  I am a big part of the problem though.... and that is that i have no desire for sex.  i was raised catholic and when i was younger, my mom always said no sex, no sex, just dont do it.  that was when i was about 17, and i am now 28.  also when i was 17 i was extremley close to being raped. so i do have some self esteem issues, and when  that happened, it kinda changed my view on it.   i have gone to counsling with an art therapist, have tried talking to people and i just dont know what to do.  i went to a sex therapist yestarday and got a few good ideas on how to start to bring in the romance.  now my bf is completly fed up with me not wanting sex.  this is a huge strain on our relationship as you could probably imagine.  if anyone knows of anything that i could do to want more sex or have any ideas of what to try or just anything....please let me know
20090205094857AADajd5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	This Question Is For Guys?	Okay lets start off with yes i'm pregnant. and no i'm not with my baby's father [[broke up after 4 years together]]. AAAAnnd. i know i shoudn't be worried about this beacuase i'm pregnant.. i'm more curious than anything.   ok..    now that, that is squared away..   There's a guy that i was with while me and my ex[[J]] were broken up a year ago.    we were only broken up for 3months.. and 2 of those months.. i met someone else.    he was/is completely awesome!!    he fell in love right away.    and it kinda freaked me out.. cuz J was my first and only love since i was 15 [[i'm 19 now]].    so anyways..    i never told this guy i loved him..and i explained it to him and he understood.    well J decided that he wanted to be with me again..    and i was torn for a min.. cuz this other guy is just the best.. and i definitely had strong feelings for him.   but i fell back to J cuz he was all i knew.    it was my comfort zone, even tho he is a jerk and always brings me down.    He was like a drug i guess, bad for you but so addicting.    soo i left this guy.    and 6 months later.. J got me pregnant, and left me.    he got scared i guess.    So this guy heard that he left me and that i was pregnant [[we have friends that are friends, thats how he found out]]    and he called me up and he went on to tell me.. that he still loved me very much and still wanted to be with me.    I told him i was pregnant and he said he already knew.    and then tells me that   He really wanted to be with me..and if that meant becoming a father, even to a child that wasn't his, then thats what he would do. he wanted to take care of both of us. :)   he melted my heart.   and no..he didn't do it for the sex.. because we had only kissed.. and nothing else.   well anyways...J decided he was an idiot.. and didn't want to be out of his childs life. so he came back.. with his words that always got me. and i broke the other guys heart again. :( i felt terrible..and of course apologized.. and he wouldn't speak to me.      and now..   5 months later. i've finally... realized, that i don't need J. So i left him. and a month later [[i'm 6 months pg now]] the other guy.. who i broke his heart TWICE.. came into my work.. randomly!! to see me. he lives an hour away.. and drove all the way down here cuz his friend called him up and let him know i was working that night.    after i got off work..   we met up and stayed together for 3 hrs..[[til 2am]]   and he kept telling me how he missed me so much!!   and all this stuff..   how he wants to stick around..   he's gonna be there for me.   and he's really sincere about all this too..   nad the next day.   he calls up.. saying.. that he wants to drive back down to see me!   and he can't wait to see me again.      but now..   4 days later.   he won't even talk to me!!!   i've tried texting and messaging him on myspace..   but he just ignores it all.      now..i still have feelings for this guy.    but i know i need to leave it alone, cuz i have other things to worry about..   but what i'm wondering is..      Why would he do this?!!??   i'm just confused.      any ideas???

20090205103305AA90SDH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why are girls so awkward?	I know this girl likes me and has done for a while, and I recently admitted that I like her (I liked her for a while but never really thought much of it) and now she wont talk, she just (for example) looks me right in the eyes with no expression if we pass each other and then carries on. Last week me and her were alright, we had a laugh and a good convo but now this week she's saying f*ck all.      She's had a bit of trouble with relationships in the past, I'm guessing that now me and her could be a reality, she is suddenly unsure. But I need opinions.
20090205095941AAHztI3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Was what I did to this girl mean?	Was what I did to this girl mean?   I broke up with my girlfriend for 5 months because she cheated on me while drunk. During this time I got involved with this really shy, sweet, classy girl. She has a history of depression and an eating disorder. It was the first time she has opened up to someone in a long time and she would always tell me ''Please don't hurt me.'' and I told her I wouldn't do anything to hurt her. We started to like each other. She thought I was a strong person for breaking up with my girlfriend and that I deserved so much better. I do drugs and she would always tell me I was better than that. I used to always bad mouth my at the time ex gf in her presence calling her a slut and saying I could never settle down with someone like that. I make it clear to her that I was over that girl and wanted a future with her. Once I started university and she got busy with her part time job we didn't see each other as much and I told her it was because I was busy with school. My ex gf came back into the picture and the feelings started coming again. So I got back together with her (yes, the one that cheated on me) She claims that she got counselling for her drinking and says she wont cheat again. I told the classy girl this, and she was crushed. Her nickname on msn is ''trying hard not to think about how badly somebody hurt me, why shold i have to cry myself to sleep?" Do you think what I did was mean, considering I put into her head that we were going to be together..and since she was so sick in the past and I was the first person she opened up to in a long time? Also, do you think by going back to the gf that cheated is a good choice? Or would you think the other girl deserved a chance..I do love the girl I'm with though even though she cheated on me.      Oh and also.. i got my girlfriend to email this classy girl telling her how much we love each other and how she wouldnt hurt me. Is that kind of mean? i MEAN, i knew she was in a lot of pain.. do you think she would take it as my gf rubbing it in her face

20090205105657AAf6YJR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I know if the relationship is working?	I just got into my first relationship with a guy. We've been friends for a little while, and now we've gone on a date and kissed a couple of times. I like being with him, and our relationship makes me happy. But how do I know that I enjoy the relationship because of the way I feel about him, as opposed to liking the relationship because we're friends and I haven't had a relationship before and I like that we kiss and cuddle and spend time alone together? I'm second guessing myself because he's the one who initiated all this, and I'm going along with it.

20090205105859AA1bbW0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I’m an 18 year old virgin?	Okay so I’ve started dating this guy, I’ve been in love with for two years, and yesterday all of a sudden he starts teasing me about being a virgin. Like how the hell did he find out? Okay sometimes I’ve acted a little surprised when Mister Hammer was happy, but I’m pretty sure it didn’t show on my face. He said it was kind of obvious, something in my eyes. Are you kidding me!      Then he said something about wanting to take it slow. I’m talking about the same guy who was quite the Casanova and NOW is the time he chooses to take it SLOW? I might be a virgin but I’m horny too. So I completely denied it but he was all smiles. Does he enjoy torturing me? Getting him a little bit drunk would probably be bad or wouldn’t it? Why does he want to take it slow, doesn’t he think I’m attractive?      And I will be talking about this with my boyfriend and maybe try one of my friends again but just looking for some opinions first. Best answer 10 pts, thanks!

20090205111258AA5BBsZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So i like this guy, and i think he likes me, is it beter if he sits in front of me or behind me? maybe aside?	So this guy... right now we're good friends. When we have class together. Now it depends who gets there first, but if he is there first, I usually sit on the side of him, like to his right for lack of a better explanation, or in front if him. Well, if I get there first, he usually sits in front of me or behing me. Directly, not like behind and to the left.       This is a stupid question, I know, but I thought maybe I could get some answers.       Its not particularly important to me because I cherish our friendship, and if friends are all we're going to be, then I'm OK with that.

My boyfriend and I have been going out for almost two years now and only have split up once for about 3 weeks (nothing serious).  When we got back together months ago everything seemed better than before, we both saw other people during that short time and we realized how much we truly loved each other. Now months after that breakup things seem off again.  We have always hung out quite often, but lately after some forced time apart he doesn't seem to want to hang out at all anymore and doesn't even seem to miss me. When I confront him about it he gets mad saying that I'm being a horrible person for even assuming anything is going on. Is he falling out of love with me? Is he falling for another girl?

20090205120600AAjwdLz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Her answers don't make sense, what do you think?	Ok so we've been dating for 2 months (this was 7 months ago) and my GF went out with one of her friends.  The went to a bar and then went back to what I thought was a guys house that they both grew up with...I saw nothing wrong with that.  After that night my GF said that 3 guys kept texting her wanting sex.  She never mentioned this before so I asked how they got her number.  She said one was the guys house they went to and the other two were his friends.  She said her friend gave the main guy her number and he passed it along to his buddies.  I asked her if she gave them the impression shed have sex with them and she said "no i've never had sex with any of them and they must have thought i would because of my dancing"  I know girls have fun with dancing so i thought that was ok.  She then said that the main guy we'll call him Jesse also would call her and they would talk.  I told her if a guy keeps asking for sex he is not a true friend.  She said he only called when he was drunk...she eventually got her number changed.  Well I ran into Jesse, he was actually a friend of a friend i hardly see.  He said they slept together a few times.  Well I confronted her about this and she started crying and said she made a mistake and didn't know where this was going between us but then the next day she said he raped her, she went over to his house knowing she'd have sex but then he raped her.  I hate to think a girl would lie about rape but it doesn't make sense.  Especially since he kept texting her and she admitted to talking to him on the phone as "friends" a month after this happened.  What do you guys/girls think?

20090205121020AASgN2X	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	10 points- do you think he likes me?	I'm in love with my teacher and i know you're gonna say 'no you're not, it's just a crush' but that's not my question. i think that he might like me and you can think it's ridiculous and illegal and what not but that's not my question either. i want you to honestly tell me if you think he likes me without including the facts that it's against the law, he can get in trouble, it's impossible for us to be together and all that bull...      somehow he always ended up around me- coincidence or fate i dont know but whenever i looked at him i'd notice him 'noticing me'. and that didn't happen once or twice, it would happen all the time. we went to six flags and he walked with me and my friend so we're not 'alone' but aside from just walking us he stayed with the group. we had a dance and he told me that he knows that there's one guy in the room that wants to dance with me and i knew that none of the guys wanted to, the one guy who might have wanted to dance with me wasn't at the dance so i wondered if he could've meant himself. i stayed after school and talked to him about everything that i've been through and was going through, and he trusted me with things about him that if i were a teacher i wouldn't tell most students about. well, i moved from that school, and i went out with a guy in my new school. i still go back to visit my old teacher so i told him about the new guy and he told me to break up with him. i said that i finally found a guy who's perfect and i can't love him because of someone else, and the teacher turned around and said that the guy i was dating wasn't perfect cause he couldn't drive. when i told my friend about it she said it sounded like the teacher was jealous and he meant that he can drive so he's perfect.      all those are a few of the things that make me think that he might like me and a few of my closest friends that would never lie to me think he likes me. aside from all those times he always teases me about all the things i do and don't do, and he made me feel really guilty about having my group at six flags leave the buses without him. do you think that he likes me or not. again i also don't wanna hear that he's probably married cause he's not.      *also resently my friend asked me if he minded me NEAR him and he said he didnt.

We were together for almost 8 months, We had the perfect relationship except i wasn't allowed at his house. This was the first time both of us had felt love. A month ago we started fighting about a lot of random stuff and how we don't see each other as much as we want. The last few days something was wrong and last night we talked for a while and he thinks im too selfish in our reltionship. He said he can't be together with this much pain so he broke up with me. he still loves me though and i love him. He said our relationship is just to hard now. He still wants to be friends though and maybe with benefits. But i cant i'm so heart broken. He said if i can prove i'm not selfish anymore in the next few days/weeks then we will prolly get back together. What should i do? Oh and I'm going through severe depression too.

Im unsure why she would ask something like that...

20090205122753AAkO9aB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I being hopeful or could this really be possible?	The first guy I ever truly loved is 2 years older than me. Us still being in school we decided it was for the better to split up. Well actually he did. See we got together over the summer. I never truly got over him. I'm still not and even though I've moved on the best I can I know there's a part of me that never will be able to. I am still in love with him. I may never have a chance with him again since he's probably moved on. I don't have any contact with him because I got rid of it all when he left me. Lately I've been having dreams of him coming back and us being in love again but they are just dreams and usually I cry after wards. I've been trying to get with other guys that I've liked a little recently but it NEVER works out for some reason. Either they get a girlfriend right before I make a move, or they like someone else. Every time. And it might just be my luck but I had a thought today of why it's not working out. I wondered if it was just coincidental or if it's not supposed to work out, because me and him are "meant" for each other? I really think this is being pathetic but I want to know your opinions and if you have any similar stories or any advice at all. Thank you.

20090205123252AATDtPy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I made a huge mistake. Someone help.?	**I know this is really long, but i really really reslly need help**      So, my friend told me she likes this kid. And she told him she liked him a few days ago. She told me and my friend and 2 other people. But anyway, she asked me to text the kid she liked last night, to see if he was ignoring her. So i did. And i said "Can I ask you something?" and when he answered me, i said nevermind its not important sorry. and he wanted to know so i told him id tell him tomorrow (meaning today) so that i could think of something to say to him, and not tell him why i actually texted him.      So today, i walk into one of my classes, and the kid that she likes was in it. and he was like oh tell me tell me tell me. so i didnt, because i wanted to talk to her first to see if i could just tell him the truth. But she was absent. SO i just kept putting it off. but the more i told him :later" the more he asked. So the girl i was partneers with in that class, wanted to know what was going on since he kept asking me, so i told her. just not the girls name. i just thought maybe she could help me think of something to say to him. But everything was fine. All day, he asked me what was going on and the girl i was partners with kept her mouth shut about the whole thing. but then we got ot gym. and the guy is also in my gym class, and so is the partner girl. so the guy comes up to me and is like just tell me please ! so i said no, & partner girl comes over too, and she made a hole big deal about it and then everyone was asking me what was going on. but i told the guy that id tell him after gym, so i had to think of something to say to him. so i told a girl from my gym class, but i didnt tell her a name either. she was trying to help me think of something to say. but then the partner girl, told a bunch of people the story. so a lot of people knew the sotry just not the person who liked the guy. and that wouldve been fine. but then we got into the locker room and my friend asked me who it was, and i said "no i cant tell you, shed kill me." and my best friend turns around and says "yeahh nikki would kill you" on total accident so everyone heard the name & knew the whole story. and now i dont know what to do. should i tell nikki?

20090205123432AA9tlEu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you talk to a girl when she is always in a group?	So there is this girl I like which is always with a friend or group of friends working on a project at school and I don't want to be waiting around to see when she is by herself.       Thing is I only see her at school at a lab so that's why I say she is always with a group it's her only class and spends a lot of time there.      Thus how does one approach this? I mean I want to talk to her to invite her to grab something at the snack bar with me you know something casual to get something going.
20090205124151AAXj6bI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I flirt without it being too obvious that I'm flirting?	I want to talk to this guy I like more and to get to know him more. He's in a few of my classes and We talk a lot in school and we laugh and joke around, every once in a while I will catch him looking at me or he'll catch me looking at him :P  Whenever he does something funny he has to make sure I'm looking.   He'll say almost anything to start a conversation.   I don't want it to be like me saying "You look good today" Kind of flirting but something so he gets the hint that I sorta like him.     Sometimes I feel like he likes me back but with the difference in our.. popularity, however you want to put it, idk if he would ever want to.     I need tips. Anything other than "Ask him out" or "tell him how you feel."   Just how to flirt without it being too obvious.

20090205124225AAdr3kA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I kinda lost feelings for a guy i liked to death?	i liked this guy a lot for a long time now and he likes me too, but more than i like him. i used to look forward to seeing him in school. but now its like i wanna see him, but i get mad when i see him just staring at my eyes when he sees me and he doesnt say anything, just looks at my eyes and doesnt stop lookin and when he sees me talking to my friends he sticks his head out to see wat im sayin even though im not talkin to him. it just kinda bothers me when he does that cuz i feel uncomfortable when he stares so much and doesnt blink, just stands in that same spot and looks at me. he seems so dull to me when he does that like he cant talk or take his eyes off of me. but i think about him a lot though and all his friends know he likes me, but now, my feelings pretty much faded because i see him as a regular person now. i dont know if i lost feelings for him or if its because ppl in the school r spreadin lies about me and some frinds are actin phony to me now so i dont trust any1 in school no more. it weird cuz i still get shy around him sometimes and i like to see him and i think about him all the time.

Would you care regardless of if you love her or not?   If given the chance to apologize, would you?   Do you consider what comes around goes around? (Karma)   Would you feel even worse if the girl did next to nothing to get you upset but eventually you found a way to get rid of her or hurt her ?   To what extent would it bother you?

Many of you will say "I wouldn't cheat". That's great but say you did, would they?         I have been cheated on and it is a horrible feeling. I could never do it to someone I love. Hypothetically speaking though, if I did, I would not expect them to take me back. If I cheated it's apparent I want to move on. Agree or disagree?      Also...      Do you think many people cheat because they are pretty confident that their SO will forgive them?

I see a lot of questions on here from women who ask how she can change certain things about her husband like she wishes he wouldn't do this anymore or do that anymore and i really dont understand if he was like this before marriage and she knew it then why complain now.

Yesterday he kept winking at me and talking to me nonstop and like waiting for me after classes and stuff... and he even said he is trying to make me like him... and he kept putting his arm around me.      So i started to fall for him       Then today i was just messing with him so i gave him a hug and then when i saw him later he barely even looked at me, he was making sort of rude jokes and just whn i was going to talk to him about "us" he goes up to one of his friends and says "hey this is my friend shes hot right?" that just grossed me out beyond belief and it made me think well maybe he is too immature to come talk to me directly about his feelings for me... or maybe he is just messing around and having fun he cant handle having an actual relationship      AHH sorry for the rant, but i want to have a clear mind tomorrow when i go to school...      DO I:   1. try to be understanding and proceed to talk to him about where we stand, like as a couple   2. just ignore him and move on because he isn't perfect
20090205153510AAHVRcN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why are men so hard to understand? Like this guy . . .?	I met him at a bookstore--I'd seen him there before and thought he was cute, so I asked him out.     He accepted, and we've gone out several times since. We have a TON in common. The problem is, everything we've done, I've been the one to do the asking. I've set everything up, etc.    He hasn't even tried to kiss me--I mean, he's obviously not trying to use me. Everything we've done, he's insisted upon paying for, even though I've offered.    The thing is, he never calls me, never texts me, but if I call or text him, he always answers and seems happy to hear from me.     I decided to stop talking to him for a week to see if he'd initiate some contact . . . nothing!    What is this guy's deal? And should I ask him?    Anymore, I feel like I'm bothering him, even though he's never said or done anything to make me feel that way. But if he liked me, he'd try to talk to me/see me/kiss me, right?     I know someone's going to say that I'm bad looking or something and that's the reason for this behavior, but I'm not! I'm just your average gal next door--and I have really pretty hair, for gosh sakes!
20090205131416AA0bXJc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	HELP!! How do I tell him I don't want to see him anymore without breaking his heart?	So I was with this guy for like three years and then it ended very abruptly. He dumped me but then wanted me back the next day and I said no because he really hurt my feelings. So now it is three years later and ever since then we have tried to be friends but he keeps getting jealous and thinks that we can just be best friends but it is CLEARLY not working. He keeps purposing to get together and talk and stuff but I just can't be friends with him. So I ignore him. A week or two goes by and then he contacts me again. I have stopped acting polite to him and I give him short answers and every once in a while we will fight about it. I have already told him in many different ways I don't want anything there, but he just doesnt GET it! How do I tell him I don't want to talk to him anymore without breaking his heart?
20090205145900AAHkeQr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	A kinda awkward but funny situation with a guy...and yes its another does he like me question :-)?	Well we have a Starbucks on campus at my university. Last semester when I went there once, a guy who worked there (also a student), was working in the back. He saw me through the window and smiled, and then came out and took my order, though there was already a girl taking my order. He said he just wanted to "double check I was being helped". He made light convo, asked my name, major, told me about himself, and said if I came back next time he might hook me up with a special latte he makes. Well, I saw him again today (a few months later). He gave me a big smile and said hi. After I got my drink and was walking out, my friend needed to grab some honey. So I was just standing by the entrance sipping my drink. I look over and he is smiling and staring at me. I give a quick smile and look away. Then look back and he is still smiling/staring. So I smile again and look away. And the third time I look, he smiles with his teeth and winks at me. Of course I blush and smile bigger. Then he starts smiling even bigger and gives a smirk. Is he just playing or does he like me?

20090205151617AA4zvg0	Family & Relationships;Friends	Dislike my boyfriend's best friend?	I really dislike my boyfriend's best friend.  He is cold and unfriendly, agrees to come over to our house for an event and then no calls/no shows, and I don't even think he is that great of a friend to my boyfriend.  I don't have to like everyone my boyfriend does but recently the best friend made a rude comment about me, to which my boyfriend didn't really stand up for me.  My BF and I argued about this topic and we have pretty much smoothed things over, but I cannot help but really, really dislike his friend.  I don't want my BF to stop being friends with this person necessarily, but it bothers me every time he mentions doing something with his friend or how he and his friend are planning to do this event or that.  Part of me feels like my boyfriend should be loyal to me (especially since the rude comment was undeserved - the best friend even said that later and I have also stuck up for my boyfriend anytime anyone says something negative about him) and so I need advice as to what kinds of internal messages I should give to myself whenever my boyfriend mentions him in order for me to keep calm and cool.  Neither me nor the best friend are going anywhere, so how do I deal?  Thanks, people!

20090205133659AAYxefF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls please help me. Most helpful answer gets 10 pts!?	I already posted this question, but I only got 2 answers, which weren't really helpful. Ok so this wicked hot girl, who kinda hates me, was going by me in the hall. To make a long story short, She told me something about her best friend, then I told her, and she was denying it and now she hates me, and she blocked me on AIM. Back to the hall part, I walked by her, then I could see in the left corner of my eye, she started to turn to look at me, and she looking at my butt. Then I turned to look at her, then she just started staring at me. And every other time I pass her, she keeps on checking me out for some reason. I also realize a month ago she just unblocked me on AIM...I haven't talked to her since that. So can a girl please explain this to me please.      I also have never had a gf before, and i'm 14 in high school. most girls just mess with me...and really i'm getting sick of it. i want someone to tell me that they love me besides my family. i've never had a girl that liked me.       if some girls could explain this and give me some advice i would greatly appreciate it. thanks

What should I talk about through text message with this boy?   I don't want to come off as boring, I'm really not a boring person at all. Its just I'm not really experienced with talking to boys. Don't tell me to talk about school books movies music etc.      I really need like to get the conversation going. I'm gonna text him I think. He told me I could text him in the morning (last night he said that) but I had classes. Before I text him I wanna know how to start it?      I just get nervous thats all. He's 14 almost 15 and I'm 13 almost 14       We don't go to the same school he goes to a high school down the road from my middle school      I know what to say when I first start of course I'll say "Hey guess who?" lol or something like that then I'll just ask what he's doing, but after that I don't know   Is that cute the "hey guess who?" thing or is it too flirty?
20090205135655AANGjU9	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do you think a company should lay off married female employees before they lay off male employees?	I think so because the man is supposed to be the provider and it is no big deal if the woman becomes a homemaker for a while but if the man gets laid off and stays at home it is depressing for him and people see him as lazy.

20090205141009AAyYJ0S	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I Just Really Miss Him.....?	Me and my ex split up about a month ago, and ive got someone new, but i still really like him. we split up because he had problems with commitment, and in all the time we were together, he just wouldnt commit to me, we never went out anywhere, and didnt do things as a couple. if id suggest it, he'd agree, then change his mind at the last minute saying 'i dont really feel like going out tonight' or 'do you want to just go for a drive instead?' he never went with any other women, he just didnt want to make the full commitment, so at the time, i decided to call it off, as it was making me unhappy, always constantly wondering whether he would ever want to be with me, and i didnt want to be waiting, say, 2 years down the line. but now, even though im seeing a really great guy, who is willing to make a commitment, and is really sweet, i just really miss my ex. i cant stop thinking about him. i even check his bebo page most days, and i get jealous if he has messages from other girls. how can i stop feeling like this? what should i do?No stupid answers please...thanks :)

20090205143635AA9LDf8	Family & Relationships;Friends	How can I deal with an insecure, and selfish best friend?	I go to her house before school every morning, and we literally just make it on time every day because she spends like 20 minutes changing outfits all the while saying things like, "I'm so fat, none of my clothes fit me. I look like an a**hole. I'm so f*cking ugly. It's okay, nobody looks or talks to me anyway. Why do I even bother." She is obsessed with her hair. If she thinks it looks bad, or if she feels fat or doesn't like her outfit then shes in a terrible mood all day, and trust me.. she takes it out on other people, including me. She also thinks she's really fat, (she's not, she weighs the same as me), and it's really annoying. She's on the verge of an eating disorder, I know it, but she doesn't have the will power. Whenever she eats something at school she goes, "Ew, I'm gross. I told myself I wouldn't go near the lunch line today." I even invited her to dinner tonight, but now she won't go because she told herself she wasn't allowed to eat anything else for the rest of the day. I just feel like everything is always about her, and all she does is say bad things about herself. I usually say "No, you're not fat, blah blah," but I'm getting really sick of it, and she always says I'm lying anyway. If she wasn't my best friend, I would've ditched her already. All of this has started recently, like, this year. She's so selfish, and I don't know how to deal with it. Suggestions?

20090205135649AAxOe1S	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	WOMEN, when you say a guy has a nice butt, what does that mean?	Just wondering what makes a guy have a nice ***.  I was told this once at a party the other week for the first time ever.  I'm 6'7" 245 lbs, I used to be a lot skinnier, but I've been putting on a lot of muscle recently.  Most of it has been in the legs, I'm squatting about 350 lbs so my legs and *** have gotten a lot bigger and more musuclar.  So does a nice *** mean big and muscular? Or does every woman have a different opinion?
20090205150650AAxj9oT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	WOMEN, what do you think about the strong-silent type of guys?	Just wondering. I'm a big guy, not fat at all, I'm lean and muscular build. I'm 20 years old 6'7" 245 lbs and my size can be a little bit indimidating to some. When I'm talking with someone one-on-one I can keep a conversation going forever, but when I'm in a big group I'm a little quieter, I talk a little but I'm not the guy at the party that never shuts up and has to be the center of attention. So do guys like me appeal to you or do you you like guys that are extremely outgoing?

I have liked her for the last year. When I started to like her, her friends asked me if I liked her, but the girl I like told me it didn't mean a thing. I can't give up on my feelings, I already tried but couldn't.      Do you think when her friends asked me if I liked her it did mean something?      I can't wait, she's on my mind all day long every single day      How do I tell her? I have no idea how to do it, I'm way too nervous and shy to tell her how I feel.

I am responding to an email to my ex-boyfriend who just told me in an email that he's seeing someone else and she's a great girl who's a virgin and they hit it off after several dates. I became jealous and depressed after he emailed me about it because I was fine when we weren't communicating. Here is my email to him. What do you think? I haven't sent it yet. I just want to know your opinions first before I send it:      "Dear Will,      I don't understand what your motive is to inform me about your new relationship. I don't see the point of you telling me about this. What do you want me to say? All I know is I deserve happiness too. I realize we could never get along as friends (or lovers) and I got tired of our constant arguing. I sincerely hope your new girlfriend does a better job than me handling your anger issues and your problems since I don't need your negativity in my life anymore. If it's any consolation for me,  I'm not even jealous because you're someone else's problem now and I'm thankful for them that they're taking your weight off of my back.      Sincerely,   C."

20090205130809AA7kVR5	Family & Relationships;Friends	Friend Problem... sort of?	I asked this friend if she wanted to go to this summer camp with me this summer.  We had been friends for a while but I trusted her enough to invite her.  But just recently, I found out about her "past".  I thought it was all rumors and she told me that none of "it" was true, and I believed her.  I just found out that they actually were true.  I kind of believed they were true, but there was more to it, let's leave it at that.  I really don't want to ask her to camp with me now, cause I lost trust with her now.  And, she is huuuuge boy crazy, and she ignores me when boys are around, and the camp is co-ed.  I thought she was over boys, which is part of the story, but she's not.   And I really don't want to have to get her out of big messes the whole time at camp, and I don't want to deal with drama during camp either, cause that's my time to relax and forget about everything at home.  What can I do to uninvite her??   Thank you!!

20090205143307AAOYDub	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	OKAY GUYS COMON. I need help here!?	Okaay, so for the past 3 or 4 Thursdays and weekends I have been asking my boyfriend 2 days ahead of time if he can hang out. When I do ask him, he always says I dontknow or maybe. Then on Thursday, he says he cant come over because he always goes to his friend's house or something instead. Dont say he is cheating because I know he isnt. Hes just being stubborn, and I think he is still interested in me because at lunch break at school he pays attention to me and stuff. I don't feel like im getting enough attention because now its led to only at school we talk and hang out.
20090205144954AAubUVt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help opinions please on relationship situation!?	So i met this guy on the internet back  in 2005, we've been speaking every night since..       im 20 atm and hes 25 ive been crazy for him since.. we've never met or spoke the phone (he says hes shy on the phone) we used to text loads everyday      so everything was perfect till mid 2007 when i typed his nickname into google and i find hes on all these swinger websites looking for sex and couples etc      i confront him he denies it and says his friend set him up..       we didnt speak for about 4 months then we started speaking again.. our feelings the same again like we were in love      we used to use webcams and talk and stuff on msn.. so i always had these doubts about him in my head      everyday i used to ask him if we can meet.. i live in leicester him in belper derbyshire.. about half hour drive or 25 mins on train..      he refuses to get on a train to see me.. and he hasnt got a car at the time..      come april 2008 he goes all funny with me and stops speaking to me because he said i was pressuring him to meet up with me .. its been three years we've been speaking on the internet!!!    he blocks my number on his phone (probably changed it)!!      i try and forget about him because im so crazy in love with him, i stopped speaking to him for 6 months and then we talk and its back to normal like we're in love..      this time he really wants me and wants to marry me and stuff (still not met yet or spoke on phone) but now im sobered up in love and have my reality cap on and tell him the pros and cons.. he still doesnt want to meet up.. so what does he want!!!!!      i made him admit that it was him that joined those websites there was a naked picture of him and i recognised him *blush* and copied the picture and threatend to send it to his family..      hes lead me on so much and ive told him off so much for being so horrible to me.      im so in love with im i wake up every morning its him i sleep and i think of him every second its him. i dream about him alot of the time too..       he is sort of a loner and doesnt really have many friends.       so today i tell him that hes not marriage material (in a much subtler way) lol and then he CRIES!!!       i cant believe it.. he tells me he really wants me and wants to be with me forever and that he wants to have babies with me and a house etc etc but isnt prepared to meet up with me.. if u loved someone youd rush to the chance to see them and want to spend every second with them...      i have built a wall around my heart and he cant no longer hurt me because i can care about him without wanting him if that makes sense.. his personality is 90% perfect apart from all this mental crazyness!!      i am stupid arent i???????????????????!!!!

20090205133045AAC7njN	Family & Relationships;Friends	I really don't like high school and I can't wait for college.?	I am a senior in high school and I have a couple of months left. The first three years of high school were very good for me, I had many friends and people to talk to. Now I started to realize that I hate this school and that the "friends" I made are not real friends. I just understood that, some of them are really boring and backstabbed me in the past. I understood the reality and now I decided not to associate myself with anyone at my school. But in reality Im a very social person but not at high school because I was very disappointed in the way I acted in the first 3 years of high school. I use to be very immature, rude and uncanny when I think about it. Now I just want to move on with my life and just go to class and come out. But sometimes I feel very bad because I don't talk to anyone and I show little emotion in some of my classes(not all I actually do laugh and smile). But I actually do love talking with my cousins and relatives, but like i said I really don't like my school anymore. I am a social person but I just despise my past memories in high school that I can't even talk to anyone there only a few people. I really want to go to college so that I could socialize there and not be bothered by my horrid high school past. Any advice? Thanks.

Sorry to use that phrase. we have been dating for a month and are now bf and gf. We are taking it slow physically. we are both christians. I am 32 and he is 35. It just seems so right, and we communicate so well together. there's is so much chemistry, not just physically, but emotionally, spiritually and mentally. I really am thinking that something will happen. He said to me that its been a while since he's liked anyone as much as me. So the question is how do you know? I think I know, but just want to hear other people's thoughts. thanks

20090205154734AAERZ1S	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boyfriend issues/break up? :(?	i dated my boyfriend for two years   i know for a fact that he thinks he has me on some leash, that he can act anyway he wants to and that ill AWAYS be there for him in the end.and he has a good reason for thinking that because i always go back to him after hes rude and everything. but today i talked to my dad about it and he told me you need to text him and say if he doesn't change then you're done. so i sent him a text saying he shouldn't contact me until he thinks he's changed because i can't keep sitting there getting treated badly by him. will he call back? i mean two years is a long time, and it'd be hard to forget about someone you've dated and had so many memories with right? he also kind of has a reason for being a jerk, cause im kind of really clingy and annoying at times. now i'm not trying to make him sound better than he is, cause he shouldn't act like that in general, but can he change? im really putting my foot down this time, and not running back to show him that i'm not a dog on a leash that can be pulled anyway he wants.   we are 16.

20090205143438AAyfLFe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Im so depressed :(     bit long sorry?	i feel like crying....   Im 16 and there is this guy in my year that i like ..I never used to talk to him at all but now we speak on msn(i talk mostly).We have at least 1 class together each day but i don't talk as much in class coz im not that flirty with guys.   Anyway..he always smiles at me and makes me laugh and recently we have been put on the same table for maths.We chat quite a bit in maths and he always listens carefully to what i am saying.Although he is like this with most girls.   He often winds me up and lets me know he is messing.   We are definitely friends but I think he may like me to because i sometimes cach him looking in my direction.When we chat he makes eye contact with me and it will be for about 3-5 seconds but he always looks away first and then regains eye contact.   I broke the touch barrier the other day as i moved his arm so i could see if he had got the same answer as me in maths(though i knew the answer).And today he called me love.   I really like him and i dont know what to do.It is easy for people to say just ask him out and for me to say that to others but i have never even been out with a guy before (im not that flirty)and i am scared of being rejected and then having all of his mates talking about me.   Recently there have been rhumours that he and this girl like eachother ,though she has a boyfriend .And today i was speaking to her and she said she thinks he is good looking....sooo sad:(   What should i do?? =]
20090205142423AA4cz0t	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would you forgive/forget if they did this?	After dating for 3 weeks (good dates all of them), they basically ignored you for 2 1/2 weeks, no text messages, no posts on facebook, no attempts at IM conversations, nothing.  Right as you start to move on they suddenly start talking to you again just like before, and you think it is because you had your best friend (whom you have some romantic interest in but the person you WERE dating doesn't know that) visited and stayed at your place for 3 days.      After ignoring you for 2 1/2 weeks and just recently starting talking again, they ask if you want to start dating again, what would you say?

20090203030313AASdJzu	Family & Relationships;Family	Why are my parents being very unreasonable?	I am only 15 and I feel so left out by all of my friends because they go out shopping every weekend when I can't.  they do ask me only a few times, they are scared to ask me - they think it will hurt my feelings. They know that my parents do not let me go out to ANYWHERE.   They think I am being too young, to go out.   I think it is because:  1)I'm deaf, but not dumb. I still can hear with a hearing  aid. I do look out for the cars and I know what is happening on the streets. I am very responsible.   2)The culture? My mum's parents were strict though. My dad's mum was okay. He's too soft and SCARED if I am going to die if my friends give me some stupid drugs or kill me.   I do so well in my school! All teachers are very pleased with me!  I never had a sleepover. My friends probably had 100 or more!   My auntie invited me to thorpe park WITH her, and my parents freaked out. I kept crying until they let me go. They did! It was my time trip to thorpe park!     They said they may not let me go out until I'm married. I want to move out when I am 18 or over, but they would call the police and everything.   Every time my friend invites me to her house, and i ask my parents. The simple reason is "No". that's it, full stop. No reason, nothing. I feel way too lonely. I even lost some of my friends over this.     They buy me clothes, when I can buy for my self. They have never let me go out to a shop to buy food FOR MY PARENTS. I want to do these things so they don't have to be tired for keep going to shops.     It's really upsetting me, and I don't want my future to be ruined because I think I don't have a social life.   My brother is 20 going to be 21 soon, and he does go out only a few times.   My cousins are younger than me and they even go out to parks by themselves and play tennis, basketball etc.
20090205150556AAunoku	Family & Relationships;Friends	I feel really weird going over there but still want to!! What do they think of me now?	I met this group of guys the other day (they are my friend's roomates) and we partied at their house together. I kissed one of them two nights in a row but he wanted to do more, he started touching me all over but I took his hands off and left. I really like him but he seems to be a party boy, so I guess it will go nowhere. I found out his other friend thought I was hot, but this guy actually wants a girlfriend. So the next time I went over there, I started flirting with his friend. While we were talking the other guy kept looking at me periodically, but I kinda ignored him. It would be nice to get a relationship with that guy, but I dont want to rush it so I just want to be friends with all of them for now. But everytime I go over there, I feel so awkward that they think I am **** or something and they dont like me. What do they think of me? Should I not go over there anymore?

20090205131106AAYvvKY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I get out of this situation?	Sorry if this seems a little long, but I'm just trying to make sure you get all the details...      I'm in grade 10 and I have a crush on this guy in grade 11. Let's call him, Greg. I don't really talk to him or say hi in the hallway, but there was this one time a mutual friend introduced me to him, I said hi, he said hi, and I added him on Facebook. I wrote on his wall, asking him "What's up?", he said, "Nothing much. And yourself?", and I said, "Nothing much." and he never said anything after that.      Today after school, I talked to his friend (let's call him Jason) and I told him that I have a crush on Greg. Plus we have this semi formal coming up and I asked Jason if Greg is going and he said no. He got the impression that I stalk Greg, but it's not true. Sure I look at Greg a lot and I try to walk through the halls he's in, but it's not like I follow him wherever he goes.       Anyways, I asked Jason to not tell Greg and he said, "But if I don't tell him, he's going to think I'm a jerk". I still asked him to not tell Greg. He had to go after, so we couldn't discuss it any longer.      Now I'm scared that Jason will tell Greg that I stalk him. If I ask Jason tomorrow if he's told Greg and he says yes, should I send Greg a message on Facebook to clear things up?      What do I do?

You didn't love her. But you also never dated her to give those feelings a chance to turn into love..      Which choice would you go with? #1 (your love) or #2?

I'd also like to hear tips from men about what has worked for them in the past. I read that women need to be challenged in order to feel attraction. Do you agree with that statement? Why/Why not?

20090205144421AA2jUd5	Family & Relationships;Family	Sexual Harrassment? Or just weird?	When I was about 10, my cousin told me and my sister that he wanted to play hide and seek in the dark. He told my sister to count slowly and to some outrageous number while he and I hid. He had his arm around my shoulder the entire time.   But anyway, he led me into his closet. He'd insist that I always sit next to him. He said weird things, too. His speaking wasn't necessarily sexual or obscene, but...just not things he would normally say. Like...how to say...it was intimate.   At one point he told me to rest my head on his shoulder. I asked why, and he said irritably, "Just do it!"   And I did, but it bothered me. I didn't get it.   Not much happend after that, because it came time for me to leave his house. I didn't say anything to anyone about it, and I never confronted him about it, but it's sort of always been something that's on my mind despite the fact that a few years have passed.      What is this considered? Harrassment? Or not? I don't really have a very strong understanding of this sort of thing.

So we sat at the bar and had a couple drinks, waiting for a table to become free. After being seated, she spilled her glass of water all over the table, and onto my pants. Naturally she had to be punished for this, as it isn't acceptable behavior. I reached across the table and slapped her face with a firm backhand. I then ordered another drink to have with my meal, and the guy at the table next to us noticed her crying. Should have I waited until we were outside to slap her?

20090205144259AA7JkT6	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Problems with boyfriend...?	me and my boyfriend have been dating for over a year and a half lately he started to treat me very bad, he was lying to me telling me he was going to do something end up not doing it, not calling, ignoring me, ditching me for friends, and when we do talk he responds back 10 seconds after i ask him something because he is to busy talking to his friends, this may not seem annoying but it truly is when it happens to everything you say. When we do hang out he blames me for everything and is very mean to me putting me down. When ever i need some help feeling better he gives me a half *** response than goes on to his problems....      i keep asking him why he is treating me so bad and says its just the way i'm taking it or that it means nothing but there truly is something behind it, i told him that if he keeps it up i don't know how much longer i can take it being put down like this and he freaks and says he doesn't want to lose me but how can he treat me this way and feel that way, and now its my fault cause I'm suffocating him when i ask him why he's lying or ditching me or anything         what can i do to make him change or to really get him to want to treat me better

20090205143953AA0wdZ0	Family & Relationships;Family	Im really mad at my mom, am I wrong?	I asked a previous question on here,(please read question from link). I got some really mean anwsers, and I would just really like to know why can't I depend on my mother to do things since "legally" Im considered an adult. I think that even though Im 20 and considered an adult, that doesn't mean that I should be completely on my own, and not be able to ask my mother for help.         heres the question,      Ok, for starters I just turned 20, I'm a full time student and I also have a full time job, I still live with my mom and her husband, since my job only pays for books. I live about 25 miles away from my school, and I take the bus to work then from work to school and back home, by the time I get home from school, its almost 11:30 at night. My mom and step father a very well off, they bought my older brother a car last year,(he doesn't work or go to school btw), they go on "shopping sprees" everyweekend, eat out every night, go on vacation at least on weekend out of every month, (so its not like they're struggling) but my mom refuses to buy me a car, for reasons she can't explain, Im just really upset that she would rather have me on dangerous public transportation at those hours! I've gotten robbed once already while on the train. I saved up some money few weeks ago and bought a car that broke 2 days after I bought it, I don't have any money left saved up and Im terrified everyday when im on the train...What can I do to make her realize that this is very dangerous!             Additional Details   My mother doesn't pay for my schooling, Im on a scholarship, and i pay for the rest of my expenses.         Also, I give her 300 a month for rent,         I understand I'm an adult now, but does that mean I can't expect help from someone who should be there for me when Im in need? I'm a good person, I'll be graduating soon, I have a job, Im not on drugs, I don't party and act all crazy, I thought thats what parents wanted in a child, all Im asking for some help so that I don't have to put myself in danger, I also asked to borrow, its not like I just want her to buy it for me, I have every intention on paying her back whether I have to or not.

20090205150147AAYHxun	Family & Relationships;Friends	My cousin have anything against me?	Ok i have this friend I talk to at the bus stop everyday he is my age and everything. I started talkin to him cuz he always was actin all quiet and I thought he might like talkin 2 somebody so i talk. when im talkin to him he acts all distant and as if he does not have alot of interest. me and him have alot in common like a latin american heritage and we both like soccer and things but its always me talkin 2 him and him never talkin 2 me and i don't know why. I know he is a quiet type of person but i just want to get to know him i wonder if he dislikes me. I have never made fun of him or anything or done anything bad around him so i don't know why he would. could he just be that type of person or could he just not like me. Im not a wierd type of person or anything like that its just that I always get this suspicion in my head about people like they don't like me, or they think im like this or that. But deep down I really don't know how people feel about me and sometimes I can be really self counsious espeically when i am meeting new people. I can read people really well and pretty much determine if people dislike me or not but I try to tell myself thats just how that certain person is and i am just being paranoid. any advice from anyone who is good with this kinda thing.

20090205154509AAzXzNr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I marry a man with a teenage kid?	He's got a 14-year-old daughter.  Every other week she spends with her mom, and when she comes back she's kind of a brat.  She doesn't want us to get married because we would all have to move, even though we would have a nicer house and she could go to a better school.  (Right now we live 40 miles apart).      We've known each other for four years, and we really want to be together.  I feel like if the three of us try to be a family, we'll wind up arguing over typical teenage tricks all the time: housework, curfew, grades, friends, boyfriends... Which would be worse, trying to be newlyweds with a teenager, or having a long distance relationship for another four years?

I called and said I was gonna go for a beer before coming home. She said it was fine.      I got home later and found there was no dinner. She said I did not come home to have dinner with her so she just went out and got something for herself.       Earlier today she called me at work and asked if I was gonna go for another beer so she would just go to her mom's place to have dinner. What the hell???      We have been living together for just a few weeks. I fear this behavior continues.

20090205135505AAuoEiQ	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do I earn my friend's trust back?	so heres the story...      I found out from a source that her boyfriend was cheating on her. she went through a lot until we both found out that i was wrong! now she thinks that i made all that stuff up so I could break them up, since I used to have a crush on her boyfriend before they started going out. She's not mad at me or anything but I can tell she doesn't trust me as much since she hasn't been telling me secrets like before.       Dont tell me to just tell her I'm not lying cause I already tried that. infact, I dont blame her cause the circumstances are actually non-believable. infact, if the same thing happened to me, i probably wouldnt beleive her.      but is there something i can do to earn her trust back without mentioning everything that has happened? is there something i can do?

He used to be into some bad things and has changed a lot for me. He has made a lot of sacrafices but he still wont grow up. I do everything and anything for him. He is 21 and still doesn't drive, and doesn't have the greatest job, which would be ok if he was in school or doing something for his future. I am a very goal oriented person and I just feel like I have grown up and left him behind. I still think hes an amazing person but I also think I am at a totally different point in my life. How do you tell someone that?

20090205135729AAa2gwI	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is it healthy to have sex out of lust in marriage, occassionally?	The thing is, I have been working second and third shift a lot lately. Most of the time my wife is either leaving to go to work, or sound asleep when I get home. Last night I got home from work and my wife was sound asleep. I was trying not to wake her, but I noticed she was wearing some really cute shorts and her the bottom of her butt cheeks were showing. I was overcome by lust.    I woke her by kissing her head and asked her if she minded if I took out a little sexual tension. She kind of laughed and told me to knock myself out. She was half asleep. It was all lust though, not romance. I think romance and spending quality time in the bedroom is important. Not just a quickie and done.    Is it ok to just have sex out of lust every once in awhile? Ot is not healthy?
20090205144646AAJjQZK	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Procedures on seeking Child Custody?	My Boyfriend and are wanting to seek full custody of his daughter. We have the money for the intial lawyers retainer and filing however not having gone through the procedure before we were wondering if anyone who had gone through it knew of anything additional we needed to prepare for like home inspection, evaluations, things like that.We believe we have a relatively good case.      It is important that we get his daughter away from his ex wife. We have previously had to have a restraining order against her. She has followed us, staked herself outside my house for hours on end. Threatened to ram her truck into our vehicles, broke into his apartment twice (before we lived together), once while he was there and refused to leave unless he has sex with her (Im not joking), hit him while he was on the phone with the police to get her removed. Wrote complaint letters to my work about me and my work performance trying to get me fired (though she is not allowed to call or come into my work so they are bogus), calls both of us endless restricting her number (so it wasn't a violation of the order but the court at some point is suppose to supeona her phone records). Committed fraud using his social security number. Stalked and harassed most of his friends and parents. Texted friends pretending to be him (like they wouldn't notice it came from a different number) trying to get information on plans we may have for going out or things we were doing so she could be there. Drives by our house screaming profanities out her car window. The list goes on and on. So far she has only gone to court on 2 charges and has plead both down to class B misdemeanors. She is currently in court ordered therapy and cannot come around our residence or harass him as conditions of her probation which she is on for 6 months. AND SHE DOES ALL OF THIS IN FRONT OF HIS DAUGHTER OR WITH HIS DAUGHTER IN HER VEHICLE!       Please let us know how we can best be prepared entering this custody battle (which I am sure it will be). She won't give up custody she uses his daughter as bait to get at him, me, his family.      PLEASE HELP!

20090205141116AAprghA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you think???????????	I really like this guy and I've been talking to him and one time on Aim, I was trying to guess who he liked and he said he would tell me if I guessed it right. So I take out the yearbook and guess every single name and he said no to all of them. I told him that I guessed every one and he said that I didn't. I was thinking that I didn't say my name but I probably thought it wasn't me. Then every time I see him in school he always smiles at me. And I was talking to my friend and she told him that I liked him on aim and he said asked me if I did. I said no because I wasn't sure he liked me back. Then he said ohh like he wanted me to like him. He also flirts a lot but I think he does that to other girls too. And we sometimes sit at the sam table because my friends are friends with his friends. And at lunch I don't really eat my lunch he pretends like hes gonna take it and everything and flirts. Does he like me back?

20090205140424AAgAc2U	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does it mean when an ex constantly blows up your phone and has nothing to say?	Me and my ex boyfriend were together for two years. I was blinded by love. He never showed me that he cared for me. He basically treated me like trash but something kept me going. At the while, my current ex told me that he got Chlamydia and blamed me for it. So, like most people I went to the source. I went to the guy I have been with for two years and asked him because we always had unprotected sex. He said he didn't have anything but why should I believe him because in the end, he was a pathilogical liar. I wasn't even accusing him, I was just telling him to be aware because he could have it and so could I. He took it to the next level. He said he was going to kill me and that I was going to end up like my father. He thought that I was accusing him. By the way, my father passed away 5 months ago. He said I was going to be dead. A couple days later, I got checked and didn't even have Chlamydia. But I didn't tell him because he doesn't care anyway. So, after the death threat, I had my brother (Bryan) call him and tell him about his self. Because my ex doesn't even know what Bryan looks like but Bryan knows what he looks like. Bryan basically told him if he doesn't apologize, he was going to get killed (but he really wasn't.) So my ex apologized to him and texted me 30 seconds later apologizing.      By the way, my ex used to call me all the itime on restricted just to hear my voice when we broke up. He's the only person who calls on restricted. Now, he's calling again. What does this mean? Why is he doing this? Is he tyring to ruin my life?

20090205150434AAw3UD5	Family & Relationships;Friends	Where did all the hope go?	Last week I was looking forward to coming back to school and catching up with everyone, and hoping I could make some proper friends. But now, after one day of school, I feel miserable and I find it hard to believe that anyone would really want to hang out with me. Nobody is interested in the same things as me, I feel like I'm watching everything happen from the outside. I always feel too shy to ask for anyones number, so I can't take part in the large amount of social interaction that is texting. I just don't feel like I'm part of any group.

She comes up to me and starts looking at my paper and her eyes get big. So she starts saying that we should get together to turor. She looking me in me eyes and I think she can sense my shyness or whatever. I am not really good with girls so I sort of put up this wall, I appear standoffish and unfriendly its my own defensive mechanism. She seems really interested in tutoring but I am like a dull ok. Class and discusion are cancelled for alwhile and I don't see her again until yesterday. Well I see her and we make sort of prolonged eye contact but we don't say anything. Today she was sitting in front of me at lecture and she turns around and see's me and she gives me a slight smile then looks away quick. I don't smile back and I have kind of a mad looks on my face. Well today she comes in talking to another guy and we make prolonged eye contact with each other but say nothing. Lol did she like me

20090205141101AAxbQvc	Family & Relationships;Family	What do I do about a dead beat dad? I need advice!?	My son is almost 4 years old. His father and I divorced when he was still an infant. When we separated he never wanted to see our son. I would call all the time to see if he would come see the baby. He was always too busy. My son also had heart disease (ASD). He was on quite a few medicines. He would try and give me money every now and then, but still never visited our son. When my son turned one they scheduled open-heart surgery, after a failed heart cath attempt. Guess who didn't show up for the surgery. Last year he caught up on child support. I am remarried now and my son believes and thinks that my husband is Daddy. But asks a lot lately why his last name is different.    I think it would hurt my son to explain the last name reason. He does know that my last name used to be the same as his. I just want to know if there is anyway to have my husband adopt my son. His father has only seen him once in almost 4 years.

I've been told by a girl that it always works. Tell me-have you ever fooled a guy and slapped his face by confusing him where you stood by leaning your weight to one side on your hip, putting a hand on that hip and then giving the guy a slap across the face with the opposite hand? Is there a way for us(guys)to be able to block that? I thought i'd be able to, but i can't. I was frozen, because the stance was confusing.

20090205130952AAFVvaJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He completely ruined me, what am I supposed to do now?	I had been seeing this guy for the past 3 months. for awhile things were going good...he had a few trust issues but things seemed to play out alright. anyways...i was pretty much in love with him...we had been together a couple times. then he started acting really . strange...he started acting distant and sort of blowing me off...and then pulling me back in when he wanted. then when things got better with us..he kept saying we were "just friends" basically right after we slept together. this was really strange to me so...i told him i needed space and didnt want to see him for awhile so my feelings for him could fade. that didnt go over too well at all. he got really hostile and wouldnt even talk to me when i tried to call him. when i did get ahold of him hed get really angry. one time i apologized and he came into my work..and sort of tried to talk to me. the next few days he seemed REALLY distant. and then i find out when i call him this week hes been seeing someone else for the past month...and that its over between us and we cant talk anymore. his words were im seeing someone i "really like" and you need to move on with things. apparantly this is a pattern that has happened in the past i found out from his sister, but i found out too late. i am feeling like i shouldnt have pushed him away like this and then he wouldnt have done it. and that its me. and now im SO insanely jealous of this new girl. hes probably way nicer to her.. i couldnt even sleep the night i found out...and i can barely take a shower. can anyone help me please????

20090205132850AAE4pyj	Family & Relationships;Family	Family issues - please help me?	Ok, so my sisters 12. My mom has a very short fuse and is always getting stressed about the smallest things. My sister is pretty difficult- she never does anything to help around the house, she yells at my mom and swears all the time.They fight all the time, and i'm always stuck in the middle of it. This evening they had a particularly bad fight about her not doing some chores and my mum threatened to drive away and not come back. Stupid i know, but all the same it scared me. She did it once when i was about 10, maybe a year after my dad died and i freaked - i really thought she was just gonna leave.      Anyhow, them fighting 24/7 is really stressing me out. They wind each other up so bad and have these massive screaming rows-i don't know what to do anymore. does anyone know how i could kind of help to work things out? i've confronted my mum on it loads of times, and she does try, but my sister makes things so difficult they end up screaming at each other 10 minutes later. its ok some of the time, but most of the time they are just at each others throats. is my sister just going through a particularly difficult time? please help, it stresses me out so bad to the point where sometimes i just don't want to come home from school.

20090205135311AAkFBeo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is he acting like this!?	Me and this guy loved each other. A lot. He would always tell me how much he loved me, and we would talk for hours on the phone every day. Then one day, he stopped calling me. He also wouldn't answer when I would call him. But the thing is, he still acts the same in person! He still hugs me and stuff but I just feel like things aren't the same anymore and I don't know why! He still texts me sometimes and says "ily", but it's not "i love u!" like it used to be. I don't understand.. why? Why did he stop? I didn't do anything wrong and I'm sure of it.. and he also doesn't have a girlfriend or anything. Whenever I try to text him and talk about serious things like us drifting, he won't answer me, but I know he gets the texts because the next day he'll text me and say hey. I don't know what to do!! I'm tired of crying about this and being stuck on him! I don't want to be if he doesn't care but I don't know if he does! He says he does.. through text messages but it isn't the same! It's like he wanted me more, and now that I want him just as much back he doesn't want me that much anymore? HELP!!!!!!!!! :(
20090205135419AATAM2B	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	"space" in relationship?	Ours is a long distance relationship. We met after 4 months. We me on 1st and on 2nh afternoon we went to the beach. He then said, "u go in one direction and i will go in another. We will meet here after 1 hour" I though he was kidding. But he insisted and said, " i need some space"  I found it totally weird and felt something fishy. Hey guys, is this normal or is something actually fishy. All the four days we were together he would say, "i am going to the gym" and mostly not come back for hour or two. Once he did not come back untill midnight. Is this something i need to worry about and question...or let go?    I posted the same question under different category but did not get answers. hope i will get few now..

Okay last school year me and my boyfriend were super close, then we broke up, and he started tormenting me that whole school year.   This new school year, he continued insulting me, but by the end of september we stopped talking, completely, we never looked at eachother or said anything to eachother.   But yesterday he started talking to me.   Everytime we're in the halls he's like "Hey" and he's sooo sweet, and nice.

20090205130719AAFjTPI	Family & Relationships;Friends	Backstabbed by my best friend?	My best friend, Caty, has totally backstabbed me. I'm disgusted, infuriated and upset. There has been a girl I haven't gotten along with for a long time named Jessica, and her and I both share a mutual hatred for each other and I would even consider us enemies. I have openly warned Caty that Jessica is a *****, psycho and backstabs all of her friends and she should stay away from her. At lunch today Caty pulled money out of her purse and told me she was going to buy tickets to a dance. I asked her who she was going with (I never go to dances so she didn't even bother asking me, but I'm cool with that because I wouldn't go anyway) and she said Jessica! I said, "Wtf? She's crazy." then Caty told me how "nice" she is, which is RIDICULOUS because Jessica is the definition of a ***** and I openly told Caty how much I hate her. Why would a best friend to this to her best friend? I don't care who she hangs out with, but it's just wrong to do this. I would never do that to a friend. I'm scared Jessica is going to tell Caty that she shouldn't be my friend anymore. The rest of the day I was totally distraught and couldn't think right... help? Please? I don't even want to see Caty's face right now.

20090205131320AAwMoFl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to break up with someone who is crazy?	I have been dating someone for about 6 months and I want to end it.  I am 22 and he is 19.  And he constantly makes up lies about things that he is doing or stuff that has happened to him.        Within the past month, 2 of his "close friends" all died mysterious deaths.  Two weeks ago, another "close friend" tried to commit suicide and he called my boyfriend had to drive him to the hospital.  He refuses to give me any details about any of these deaths.  His first excuses was because "they were under investigation."  When he realized that I didn't buy that, he changed his excuse to he "doesn't want me to know what happened."      He lies about other things too: he knows I am a runner and on our first date he claims to have ran a marathon, even though I checked the marathons website and there is no record of him running it.  He told me last week via text message he was assaulted with a baseball bat in a mall parking lot by a gang of 14 year olds.  There have been dozens of other ridiculous lies like these that he has no reason to lie to me about but does.        I can't take it anymore.  He is constantly miserable and I honestly believe he is making this crap up because he feels that I am becoming distant and it is his last effort to try and get me to stay around.        I should have ended this relationship months ago but I felt bad because his grandfather had died and I didn't want to make him more miserable.  I haven't seen him in over two weeks because I can not stand to look at him anymore.  I told him that I needed "space." We have spoken a couple of times since then on the phone and he has sent me a few other text messages with bizarre antidotes that have happened to him (lies!).       How do I break up with him? Is this an appropriate circumstance to have a break up over the phone?  He is really moody and I have no idea what he would do if I told him to his face that I don't want to see him anymore.  I don't really think he has any idea that I want to break up with him, I think he thinks that I am having problems with my own life and that is why I haven't seen him in 2 weeks.  I have no problems, I just don't want to see him anymore!
20090205131819AAmwtqy	Family & Relationships;Family	I have a question about sex, my mom does not know I know about it?	Hi, I am a 15 year old male and I have a bit of a problem, my mom does not know that I know what sex is. I have know for about 4 years now. You see I went to school until the the 1st grade, I was bullied until I refused to go back, so my parents decided to home school me. I was very happy about that, every body in my home school group was very nice and still continue to be to this day. Now here is where I have 1 problem and 1 problem only, my mom refuses to allow me to know what sex is. I found out what it is by reading a home medical book, it had a clear and very explaining chapter on the subject, so I learned "where babies come from" and "STD'S" and all of that stuff.  Well I had been forbidden to read that book my mom said under no circumstances am I allowed to read it, so of course she did the put it up on a high self routine and all that stuff, well that didn't stop me, I got a chair and of course read it. What I read did not come as a shock  nor did it "upset me" I read it and took it as "well that how that works" So of course I did not tell my mom that I had read it, because she said DON'T very clearly. So I said I am just going to have to wait until that "birds and bees" talk. Then I noticed that a chapter in my health and science book had been removed, so I then turned to the index to see what was missing, and you guessed it the "Sex Ed" chapter was missing. So then I slyly asked her "I saw a part of the book was missing, what was it mom?" and she said "It's something your to young to know about" well I was 13 and I thought to my self, "gosh I am old enough to know about sex by know" do you agree? Now if that is not enough when ever we drive by an anti-abortion sign or poster, she always demand I look the other way, now this is becoming a pain in the pants, because when ever my friends even get near the subject of sex or even abortion my mom goes nuts, she makes all these odd faces at them and when one of friends ask why she does that I said "I don't know and walked off" not exactly knowing what to say. And also if my mom know I was posting this I would be in B.A.D trouble. And this is not a joke I am 15 and every thing I said was true.

20090205131916AAlvhmK	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My wife, out of nowhere, told me doesn't know if she loves me anymore?	I am 34 and she is 33.  We have two wonderful children, ages 4 and 6 and are both girls.  My wife and I never argue, yell, scream, etc.  The only things we've had disagreements over that were big were the sex and money.  I know that those two things in a relationship are huge.      After we had our first child our sex life really fell off.  I didn't understand it and definitely didn't understand how hormones can affect a woman and I was hurt.  I felt as if she wasn't attracted to me anymore and I said as much.  When it happened, and it did last for several years, we would sometimes have arguements about it.  I would become distant and hurt and she knew why but would try to explain her situation.  I listened and I tried to be patient.  About a year and a half ago we really reached a common ground.  I think I finally realized that I was being selfish and insensitive.  She began really trying to make an effort to improve it and since then everything has been wonderful.  As a guy, everyone knows that 3 times a day isn't too much but once a week and sometimes only once every two weeks kept us both happy.  We've been like that for more than a year and a half.      Regarding money, this was one of the biggest issues we've had to face.  After our first child she spent ALOT of money on credit cards and did not tell me about it.  I ended up not trusting her with money and we've been slowly paying it off over the years.  I've also gotten on her a little here and there when she would buy frivolous things during times when we were short.  Anyway, over the last couple of years she has really been so good about it and I made it very clearly over and over how thankful I was.  At Christmas she wanted us not to give each other any gifts but I got her a $500 gift card just to say thank you.  I also pretty much told her to buy whatever she wanted over the last few months because we were doing okay.      I should add this.  About 10 months ago she had a Mirena IUD inserted.  I did not notice a difference in her behavior, or at least nothing major.  About two weeks ago she was acting real wierd and distant.  I asked her if I had done something and she said no that her hormones were acting crazy and made her feel bad.  Then, last week everything seemed to be perfect, we had a great date night, and great Saturday night dinner.      Monday, she came home from lunch and i was off.  She walked through and didn't give me her usual hug and kiss.  Then, that night, she had already said that if the kids were asleep we'd sneak in the other room and have a romp.  It did not happen and she just went to sleep.  The next morning I sent her an email at work asking what was wrong.  Her response was devastating.  She started by saying she did not think she could ever satisfy and then she said she did not know if she was in love with me anymore and did not know what the future held.  I was devastated and shocked because, like I said, we don't fight and get along at least 23 hours and 59 mins of the day.        I told her that our sex life had been great for more than a year and that we have not had a disagreement over money in at least that much time.  She was in agreement and when I asked her why she felt like she did she could not give me an answer.  I asked her if I had failed as a husband or father and her response made me even more confused.  She told me that I was the best husband I could have been and the best father and there was nothing more she could ask for.  She absolutely cannot explain why she feels like this.  She has said that every once in awhile this feeling would creep up, but she couldn't understand why and then it would just disappear a few hours later.  It only happened every few months but she never said a word to me.  The odd thing is that she told me it was around the same time the IUD was inserted that the wierd and unexplainable feelings came about.      Now, she wants her space and as hard as that is I am giving it to her.  She said that way she can find out if she misses me.  What in the world could have led to this?  could the IUD be the culprit?  What should I do?

20090205133258AAlkpak	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he serious about HIS girlfriend?	So here's the situation:      One night a few weeks ago, I was at a party and everyone got really drunk. This friend of mine, Kyle, was drunk and kept coming over to me asking me to kiss him. Well this guy has a girlfriend so I didn't want to let him do anything he would regret.      As the night went on I got more drunk, and ended up giving into him. I let him kiss me, close-mouthed, and I remember it being wonderful. My knees shook and everything. Well that didn't shut him up. He was then demanding a real, 'better' kiss from me. Long story short, I ended up walking him back to his place. And we made out. Amazing, shirtless, making out. The whole time he told me it was ok because his girlfriend was in a different area code.      Now when I see him he finds the first possible excuse to leave the room, even though when we make eye contact he looks happy to see me. Even before this incident, he never introduced me to his girlfriend. We were at a fancy banquet and everyone was getting pictures but he wouldn't even talk to me because his gf was there.            Now, I didn't give you all of the information, and my question isn't about how wrong it was of me to do anything. I'm aware of that. I don't need lectures.      Does it seem like he's ashamed of what he did or maybe just that he's having issues with his gf? I don't necessarily want anything else to happen with him, I'd just appreciate it if he didn't avoid me like the freakin plague.

If you are in love, or if you like somebody, then type in your name (first and last), then write loves, and finally the person you love. If the person you love looks at this, then you two can actually sit down and talk about this. At the end, I'll will just choose a random answer, as best answer. If you don't want to do this, then don't answer at all please.   P.S. In addition, if you want to express your feelings, go ahead. Whatever suits you.

20090205133655AAdkCD3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would you date Daria (from the tv show)?	The tv show, Daria, aired in the late 90's and early 00's. She was highly intelligent, but also highly pessimistic. She did, however, have some optimism, as she did date a guy and tried to do the right thing against the corrupt world she lived in. If any guy remembers and liked the tv show, and also can remember more than what's mentioned about Daria's personality, would you date her in real life if you could? (More than a yes or no answer would be most helpful).

20090205133859AAs2k9r	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me? And what would he want?	Ok, so there's this guy i really like. We've always been pretty close but he went out with your typical '****' a few months ago, and we stopped talking for a bit. Now we're really close again, closer then ever. We had a drunken kiss one night & met up the next day with a group of friends and we spent the WHOLE day together. We really clicked. And since then, we've had comments made about us by other people, and everyone thinks we have 'something going on'. We have SO much in common, and he's told me this, and he's told me he likes spending time with me too. Before the '**** girl' he'd never had a girlfriend really, and everyone was surprised that they were together because they were so different. She still likes him, but he's made it clear to me that he doesn't like her. Today, he said i had really nice eyes, and it just made me think about how much i like him. Does he like me? And seeing as his last girlfriend was a '****' would he want the same sorta stuff out of me? I really like him, but i'm not willing to give him what she did. Would that put him off? I'm normally good with guys but i can't work this out! Help please! (: xxxx

How would you describe this person? adjectives wise (need a recommendation). pretty impressive huh?
20090205135453AAEM2UD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm dating him, he's my best friend's ex-boyfriend, whom she's still head over heels for. What should I do?	Over the holiday season, my best guy friend frequented my house. He also happens to be my best friend’s ex boyfriend. She broke up with him before the season, because he was pushing her away (he knew that he liked me, and felt bad about it, but couldn’t break up with her because he promised he’d never leave her. So he pushed her away till she had had enough, and broke up with him. She still loves him though. A lot.) During the time he was at my house, it came out that we’d liked each other for a while. But neither of us wanted to progress in our relationship till my best friend knew what was going on. I consulted her, and she gave her blessing, saying that she would be happy so long as he was, and I was more than capable of achieving that end. I believed her, told him, and he asked me out shortly after. She wasn’t actually okay with it though, and still isn’t. She’s still head over heels for him. And she thinks neither of us cares about her anymore, because we see how much it hurts her to see us together, and are still dating. Believe me, if I had even the slightest inclination that he might go back to her if I broke up with him, I would have already done it, regardless of how much it would hurt me. But he wouldn’t, he likes me too much, and has told me multiple times that if I need time to think, or anything, he’ll gladly wait for me. It kills my best friend that we’re together, it would kill him and I if I broke it off. I don’t know what to do at this point, so I decided to poll the populace of Yahoo. What do you think I should do/what would you do/have you ever been in this situation before?
20090205135613AA9bIHe	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I need some advice with this situation.?	Ok so first off I want to say, that although I do have one child, and love children, I am not going to be an automatic sitter.      My Son and I just moved in with my BF. He is in kindergarten, unfortunately, he has a kid in his class that lives in the house next to our apartment house.      FIrst day this kid finds out where we live, and just comes over by himself. No parents around, or either they let this 6 year old do what he wants. I was trying to be nice the first day, so I let him play for an hour. He is a very nice well mannered little boy. But I am no ones sitter.       Well it is a week later, and I am just to the point where I ignore the child when he knocks. I have told him this is not going to be an everyday thing. It is the still cold out and there is not much to do around here, I understand he is bored, but he in not my responsibility. I like my privacy, I do not want our apt. to become the local hangout for kids.       When he did come over the one time, I truly believe he was trying to steal some of my son's toys. The ones that would fit in his pockets at least.      He comes from a less than privileged household, telling me his father is wanted by the cops and has hurt him before. Although we are not rich, my son has a lot of toys.       Need some advice on how to handle this situation, am I just being mean, or are should his parents step up and take care of their kid?         HELP!!

Today during lunch towards the latter part of it, a girl next to my table threw a pretzel at the back of my head. I heard a lot of giggling in the background, so I smiled and turned around. She pulled up to my table, said hello, pointed to her friend asking me if I found interest, I said no, then asked me what grade I was in, I showed her my black ID meaning I'm a junior. She asked me what college I'd like to attend, and I said I wasn't sure. After smiling at me for a little bit, she asked me if I was a virgin, I didn't answer, then she asked me if it was too personal, and I just shook my head. What exactly was going on?

20090205140734AA5P4zQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	HELP! Why is she acting like this? So confused!?	I have been dating this girl for a month, and things have been going very very good. We were already holding hands and kissing. Suddenly, 3 days ago, she started ignoring me. She stopped replying to texts and phone calls, using excuses like "I didn't see your call until later". She also backed out of plans we had yesterday without letting me know until the last minute.   I have NOT been too aggressive, I don't call her TOO often and I try to give her her space. But I am so confused about why she is acting like this. I initially thought she might have gone back to an ex boyfriend or something, she seems to talk about him a little TOO often.   Then suddenly, today she calls me and acts like nothing is wrong, talking normally, and wants to go out.. Is she playing games? Why is she doing this?      I am 23, she is 22.

20090205141028AAEkQ6l	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does He like Me? (Guy and Girls answer)?	I am 14 and in 9th grade. I was talking to my guy friend who I also have a HUGE CRUSH on and we were talking about who our partners were for the salsa dance unit we did in gym. Then just sort of out of no where he asked me if I "liked" my partner and I said no. He then proceeded to ask me if I have a crush on anyone. I told him I did but I was never going to tell him who it was. It was really strange because we never talk about our love life or crushes. We usually just talk about school and life in general. Does he like me?? btw he is really shy.

20090205141529AAEaHQw	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should we divorce or try to work this mess out?	I have had problems with my hubby since we married. In the beginning, he was very sweet, kind and loving. Right after the wedding, he turned into a controlling, mean and selfish man. I finally made up my mind and said that I had enough. I do not even feel the same way I felt for him when we first fell in love. He's not even willing to compromise. I felt like I was his slave. We didn't kiss, hold hands, talk or anything. I felt like he wanted me to become submissive to him and let him control me. I even noticed that I am beginning to walk 10 feet behind him. He calls me out of my name and totally disrespects me. He turned into a monster and I just can't live my life like this anymore. I am educated and independent. I do not have any children and I am an E4 in the US ARMY. I want to leave now while I am still young and free. Start my life over, take it slow the next time and never look back. WHAT DO YOU THINK?????

20090205143159AAojB7s	Family & Relationships;Friends	What would you do in this situation? Long, but please read!?	My husband, 7 month old son and I just let our friends move in with us. They're younger than us, and she's 34 weeks along with a little boy. We did it to help them out, and to help our selves out as well with saving a little money. Well, we've lived with them for about a month now and we're all to the point where we want to bonk each over the head with a cast iron skillet. We DID have to sign a new lease with them on it, it's 6 months. Here are some of the things they have done (or haven't done) in the past month.       1) SHE has done the dishes, once. He does nothing to help out around the house - no taking the trash out, nothing.       2) They expect me to get the house unpacked and put together since I'm a stay at home mom. He's the only one that works between the 2, but she locks herself in their room during the day.      3) We have caught them lying to us about bills and money and other things.       4) They eat our food and don't offer to pitch in any money for it. Also, if we order pizza, they help themselves to it and again, don't offer to chip in.      5)They use the last of things and don't bother to tell anyone. They had nothing when they came here, so I told them they could use our bath supplies, etc as long as they told us before they used the last of something. They have used the last of our shaving cream, taken razors, used the last of the shampoo and body wash and not said a word.      6) They are all the time talking like they know everything. They stay out until 3am partying and he drinks and he's not even old enough to do so legally. When we joke around with him and tell him he won't be able to do it when the baby is born, he gives us an attitude and says "watch me."      7. They haven't yet paid any bills but their half of the phone bill and rent.      8.Her sister just had a baby, she was 7 weeks old last week when they brought her over. It was 11 degrees F outside and they had the baby in nothing but a gown. No socks, no hat, no blanket. When they put her back in the car seat to leave, they put both of her legs off to one side and didn't buckle her between her legs.      9) If she's sitting near my son or playing with him, she lets him get hurt. He's just started crawling and so he finds things and sticks them in his mouth..she lets him choke! She just stares at him! And she let him pull a kicker toy down on his face, bruise his nose and bust his lip.      Those are just some of the things that they have been doing that's bothered us. I know that #8 didn't effect us directly, but I have a baby and I couldn't believe she did that. She'd better hope I don't catch her treating HER baby like that. Someone will call CPS on her so fast it's not funny and since her child will be in my home, I will be involved as well.       What would you guys do in a situation like this? Please give me some advice..they used to be our friends but now we are starting to hate them with a growing passion! Please help!
20090205143203AAXe6XD	Family & Relationships;Family	Will he get unsupervised access?	My partner has been battling for three years to get access to his three year old daughter. He spilt up with his ex because of her unreasonable behaviour and as revenge she has prevented him from seeing his daughter. She then accused him of all things under the sun and went through three solicitors as they discovered her ridiculous lies. He has commited no crimes and lives in a stable home environment with me and my two daughters.   Last April an out of court agreement was made for progressive access, firstly supervised with his ex and then after a few months he could have access unsupervised.   However she is still insisting on supervised access even though he has been back to a solicitor who referred them to mediation. Mediation wrote an agreement between them that she would supervise for another two weeks then it would be unsupervised access.   She has yet again gone back on her word and insists on being present for another three months. This is ridiculous because his daughter is totally at ease in his presence and there are no problems at all. Does he have to go back to mediation or can his solicitor put in a court order so that he has definitely got a day a week unsupervsed access with no conditions. Its only been through her solicitors telling her that she had to give in that she allowed my partners parents to see their grandchild.         All he wants is a few hours a week with his daughter. For her to get to know his side of her family without his ex being there.         Note..i have kept out of the situation and only met the little girl last week for the first time but as me and my partner are in a serious relationship we thought it was time she got to know me too.

I am not really a shy person but I am new at my high school (I`m a junior) and I like this guy... and I`m somehow a little shy around him. Once I speak to him it`s okay but so far he was allways the one approching me and not the other way round. With my friends I`m really not shy but somehow it`s like I put a wall in front of me or something with him...    I think he liked me in the begining of the year but I guess I kind of sent of the wrong vibe to him... Sometimes we talk really well but sometimes I`m just kind of distant. It`s hard to explain, I guess I`m sort of weird... hihi   What can I do??? Please... Just tell me something!

20090205143503AAHgK4k	Family & Relationships;Family	What should I do when my son's father blames me?	My son's father did not call him on his birthday.  My son (12) called his dad and asked why he didn't call, and he told him that I called and said that he was not allowed to call him!  Which is a crock!  Then my son started blaming me on why his dad never calls him anymore.  I then picked up the phone and asked him why he was using me as an excuse and he started calling me unmentionable names.  My son was standing close enough to the phone to where he heard what he said.  he was not happy.  Now I don't know what to do.  It's not like he calls or even tries to come and see him, or pays his child support.  But my son is mad at me because of it, it's not my fault.  His dad is just a deadbeat and always has been.

I don't know, I just feel like knowing different people's reasons on why to date.

20090203035238AAd0Aqr	Family & Relationships;Family	Me and my sister fight all the time!?	Not fist fights but words fights. She has a big anger problem. If you don't do what she wants she gets really mad. Even at the littlest and stupidest things! I've tried really hard not to say anything back when she starts yelling at me but it gets really old quick. We tried counseling and that doesn't work. She even yells at my mom like its nothing. I just want to hit her in the face and just tell her what she is doing so she will stop! But if I did that then me and her would start fist fighting and my mom would call the cops. So any good suggestions on how to handle her. Like she says really mean things to me and my mom and gives us no respect. It's even worse when she has a friend over. She acts like she can do whatever or yell at me whenever. I guess she thinks it is a game but its not. But thanks to anyone who can help!

20090205144415AAM50l7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	If your crush knows you like him do you ever make it seem that you don’t?	like him or act weird/sending mixed signals      I like the girl who may have liked me first because she used to smile and stare at me and I felt attraction for her in my gut 3 times which was unspoken, and she didn’t have to do anything for it to happen seeing how I felt it when she was sitting behind me in class and pointing her crossed legs at me (because when I felt it I turned and saw her doing it).      Now she doesn’t look at me anymore, and when I pass papers back she seems annoyed. I moved a seat over so she can pass and she didn’t thank me.       Same thing happened with another girl, shed look at me and I knew she liked me because I felt it and then I moved my seat closer to her and she started acting like she never liked me which she did…      Ha she might be acting like she doesn’t like me on purpose to scare me off because she knows she cant have me (as in she may have a boyfriend right now).      I realize I wont tolerate girls like this anymore, but I’m just wondering if any of you do this, act like you don’t like your crush when you realize they like you back? If you do, or can explain why and it's not what I have in here, then please do. Thanks.

20090205144754AAwgsZx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How should I start off talking to my crush again? Doe he care or is it me that's acting stupid? I love him!?	Well, my question is about a guy. I’m 16 years old and I’m in love. I didn’t even think it was possible at that age, but I found the one that I would like to spend the rest of my life with, etc.. I found this hunk of a guy(hehe) in my Math Analysis class and his name is A.J. He was 15 but now he’s 16, yet he’s one grade lower than me. When I first met him, we were finishing each other’s sentences. That’s how Great we got along. He and I would agree on every issue and family experience that happened to us. Besides the obvious, I noticed other signs that he was giving me like: (sry if this takes long) PLZ read this carefully XD   1) One day he got up to ask the teacher something before class and I looked up from my work and saw him staring right into my eyes, like STARING. I held my glance cuz I couldn’t pull away honest (I guess that’s what happens when you fall in love). His eyes I finally searched real good and I saw the most caring emotion just wash over him, it was really beautiful, then I looked away. When I stared @_@ him it looked like everything else was a blur. It must have been weird concentrating on each other’s eyes and that was the day he was not supposed to be in class-sports thing for b-ball but I know that you start forgetting things when you like someone like I did withmy math book, keys, and MP3 because your so focused on “the one”   2) When me and my friends Bridget and Miguel would talk, he touched my leg with his when I wasn’t looking and it was funny cuz no one knew about it   3) He is very protective of me like he would get mad at even my friend if she was talking to him as he was talking to me.   4) He is the most jealous person I know? I talk with my friend Bridget during the first 15 min. of  the class period because we read. I usually read a mag and the Jonas Brothers were in it, totally understandable and to be personally honest I’m not their biggest fan but obviously he thought I was. All I wanted to do was show my friend because she’s In Love with them. And then he shoots back withy this girl is hot –blah, blah, blah (kinda cute) total rampage he went nuts   5) Sometimes, (I only have him for one period), we wait outside for the teacher to come and he would rarely get their later than me but he came up behind me and came really close and just stayed there comfortably with me   6) One day, me and Bridget were going to her locker and he came up to us. He asked if we had HW even though we didn’t. Bridget said “no” and he said “yes we did!” and she kept saying “no, we did not” and I chimed in with a “no I don’t think we did” and he stopped tensing up and I said “I’m going there right now anyways for tutoring” and he said “alright, I’ll go check” I saw him walk towards the classroom and then he walked back the opposite way and I was like ‘hmm..’ I was being tutored and he came in with two of his friends and he ditched them to come sit next to me.   7) I see him everywhere!! Literally library, lunch line, buildings, everywhere! And he knows where I’m @ at all times. He has me down to a T.   8) I mentioned something about “cold hands in a convo” and two days later he mentioned that he had them too to Miguel and he stopped to look at me to see if I figured as much   9) One day I said to Bridget I have to tell you something because we were talking about Homecoming Dance and she asked me “What, did someone ask you to prom?” and I said NO and he looked at me really long the deepest cut stare out of the corner of my eye   10) He helps me out in clas if I don’t get something and only me not Bridget or Migule or any other girl for that matter.   11) When I first met him, he used to be real nervous he still kinda is   12) If I ever tease him he uses my real name but when I tease him he laughs and looks down thinking hard.   13) One time I had candy out and he bought one(Twix! little inside joke) and he smiles every time he sees me like I do to him and I used to laugh at nothing I think I made it a little obvious hehe BUT on that note? the teacher got warning to me and said put it away and I was eating while putting it away and he loked away and smirked like he was thinking of good old memories   Well now this is the dilemma, hes been called into the library by my nosy friend who was the worst one to tell because she is “THHE MATCHMAKER OF THE SCHOOL AND IM CLIENT NUMBA 2” now that’s sad and my other friend told him hehe Elisabeth and he got realllll nervous and fidgety.. recently I think that’s a good sign *sigh* I love him soo much I would take a bullet for him and a knife in the same location.   Don’t know what to do for Valentine’s either.. hmm.. GR8.. Now we’re not really even talking because he knows I like him but he did come to my 4th period. It was like before he was my boyfriend “in secret” because he would wait for me and take me to my 4th period for a while. I want to befriend him first possibly but then I don’t him to see me as a friend only, you know that’s the only thing I’m really worried abou

20090205151354AAAZpPt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why does my Ex boyfriend love it when I talk to him?	Every night after I get home from work my ex boyfriend wants me to talk to him. The only way we can talk is by email so we just send emails back and forth. At first we were talking just to get to know each other better, but now I'm a little confused because I'm not sure what his intentions are. I asked him what he's going to do today and he said that he's going to try helping more people and talk to me. From what he said, I know that he enjoys talking to me. But he's my Ex and he has a girlfriend so I don't understand why he wants to talk to me when he's with someone else. I do care about him more than he knows but I don't want to be with him if he's with someone else. I certainly don't want to be the reason he leaves his girlfriend. What should I do about this?

Like, once, we were watching science fair presentations and they were discussing how saltine crackers taste like cardboard. so I said to the general public, Freddie sitting next to me, BTW, "I put peanut butter on my Saltines," and Freddie turns to me and says "Sticky cardboard" to which we both laughed.   He's made other comments to what I say, and laughs at my jokes, though not too hard, and they're not really all that funny (like once, something in blood which they were showing a diagram of, and it looked like Pacman, and I said really quietly "Heh, Pacman," and he laughed). once, we were talking about blood typing (just the two of us) and he told me about a time they gave him a blood test and they put a needle in his arm and held it there awhile (EWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!)    So, do you think he likes me?   and, do you think I should ask him whether he's going to an upcoming dance (ME: hey, are you goin to the dance? FREDDIE: (either) yeah. ME: Cool. (or, if Freddie says no) ME: Aw, that's too bad. You should come.      so, what do ya think? ASAP please, because the dance is tomorrow, sooo...

20090205152901AAWxfL3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys Flirting With My Gf/No Respect For Our Relationship?	Is it normal for guys to flirt with a girl they know isn't single?       Whenever it happens, it makes me angry. It's not jealousy, but these guys treating our relationship as if it means nothing, and trying to get with her. One made it plainly obvious in a number of messages on  her profile on a social network site what he wanted to do to her, while pictures of us together were nearly directly next to the comments he left.       I know I would never treat a girl like this, but why do they and is it something that is normal in a town/city environment? I grew up in the country and am not really used to the spiders web that some relationships have in towns.

But, whenever I go to swim practice he barely talks to me.  And he also flirts with this other girl.  So is he into me or should I forget about him.  And if he is, how can I get his attention?

20090205153529AAOHU8u	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I get back the girl I love?	I have been with my girlfriend for almost 2 years now and for the most part we have both had an amazing time. At New Year we fell out and had a massive chat about how we felt and she told me she didn't feel looked after by me and she didn't feel protected in our relationship. There have been a few times that I have stood back when I should of stood up for her but for some reason I didn't and I hate myself for it. I wont go into detail but I promised her things would change an I would stand up for her and protect her and make her feel as special as she deserves. BUT the first time we were on a night out together after this I did it again, I let her down big time and I don't think she can ever trust me again. I love her SO SO much and I don't understand why I let this happen and don't look after her. It seems sometimes I cant even stand up for myself let alone someelse, but Im working on it and need to grow up and grow a pair.   I don't know what to do though, I need to change mentally? She says that im too nice and that im afraid of upsetting other people by standing up to them for her but when it comes down to it I would do ANYTHING for her and i mean anything....but then when I have a chance too prove this too her I blow it! Any advice on how to be stronger and start standing up for myself? Then how do I show her that I can protect her and her feel worth it? She knows that I love her and she loves me too its a just a case me not having a quality that she realy wants in a partner....Im determined to have this qualtity though, Im just not sure how! Im willing to do whatever it takes, I really cant live without her!

20090205155047AAVE9eG	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Divorce: how can she keep the dog?? help!?	my mom-in-law is getting a divorce. they adopted a dog before they got married. the dog was for her as a gift and was living the entire time at her house, under her care. the ex never lived full time at her house, as his own house was only a few streets away. the dog's job was to keep coyote's and wild animals off of her property and away from the other animals. when they were splitting up, we asked her if we could have the dog because we have always loved him and wanted to train and take care of him to be a pet. the original agreement for their divorce was to take each of their stuff and separate (they were only married 6 months). so they did.       3 months after the ex is being a jerk and wants the dog just so she cant have it. anyway, the original adoption is in his name and his info. how can we keep the dog? my logic is that if she gave the dog to strangers instead of us, how can the ex track down those people and ask for the dog back... can he legally? also, the dog was a gift and i dont know how that works in divorces. there is obviously no monetary value on this animal we love. im very upset about all this as the dog has become a part of our family now. please help us! thank you!

20090205163020AA8cZDg	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Wedding Website & Gift Registry?? Opinions?	Let me first start by saying, I thinks its really tacky to ask for gifts ETC. I am registered at two different places for my wedding. I am not sending out the registry information with the wedding invitations ( I also find that a little tacky) they will go out with the bridal shower invites, and a link to our wedding website will go out with the Save The Dates. On our website we have lots of information about the wedding, the bridal party, hotel and airfare information, and some other cutesy things, including one page that says where we are registered with links to the stores websites.      I moved to Oklahoma with my fiance and my family lives in Michigan. If they are going to buy larger items off the registry it would be really great if they ship them to our home, because we can't fly with mixers and meat processors.       Do you think it would be in poor taste to put on the website next to where we are registered ,our home address, and find a nice way to word it to have items shipped there. Or should I just ship them from Michigan to Oklahoma my self after the shower?? My only thought with that is, that it will start to get very expense shipping gifts back home from Michigan between two bridal showers and a wedding.      Opinions or other ideas please... thanks!

20090205155806AAxHDfr	Family & Relationships;Family	PLEASE help,, About my child?	I found a loophole in the child support system and need to get your honest opinion about if i should take it or not..When i had my son i was only 17, I was stupid and didn't know what to do.   I had my son in 1998, About 4 months later i found out my girlfriend cheated on me, so i dumped her. I would still try and see my son as much as i could, but she wouldn't let me, I was giving her money every week. I think i seen him about 3 times since we broke up. to find that she moved our son out of state, she went for child support and then she moved away. I always paid support  and searched for him for 5 years when i gave up. I believe that he will turn 18 soon and hopefully look for me. Now 11 yrs later i have 4 other kids to support and due to injuries i have ""mental/physical i have trouble retaining a job. If i take this loop hole i can be free of the courts trying to put me in jail,seizing my bank accounts, suspending my license. and be able to support my other children. Would i be wrong in taking this rout, or should i work my self to a wheel chair or risk going to jail while my family gets thrown in the streets cause I'm the only source of support..

So would you rather be the first to die, or the last in your family?  Well if you die first, than you wouldn't have to go through the pain of watching the rest of your family die and stuff.  If you die last, than it's the complete opposite, you're gonna have to go through everybody else's death, which will be hard.

My husband myself and our daughter live in one house, my brother wife and child in another and my parents in another. My parents always help us out so my husband helps them with the farm work to pay them back. The problem is my brother and his wife get more help than us and dont help out But I dont say anything cuz it would just upset my parents. But the big problem is they dont watch their daughter properly and a lot of the time I have to watch her cuz they just let her wander and its a farm so this is very dangerous. And there is times when my husband working in the shed driving the forklift and she almost runs in front of it. This really upsets me and my husband as we dont want to hurt her and have to live with that. So now when she comes in the shed alone my husband will ask her to go home. To witch she runs off screaming like he did something horrible ( she overreacts for attention) and then my mum will look at my husband like what did you do? And its like she thinks he did something worse. Like this one time they were playing and it was time to take my daughter home so we told her to say bye and to come home their child kept blocking our daughter so she couldnt get home (she wouldnt let her got off the swing) so after a minute or so and the parents were inside and wouldnt do anything my husband just picked her up and sat her down away from our daughter.she then screams blue murder and everyone acts like we hurt her. And her mum comforts her for this behaviour. What do we do I know its not our business what they do but its hard when we have to watch her and she almost gets hurt and then it would be our fault.

20090205160204AA1WC6n	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Need some help figuring this guy out? I'm exhausted.?	Please help, I'm losing my mind with this guy!   Well from the beginning: I used to go to my friends parties about a year ago and I always saw this one guy there, I never talked to him but he added me on facebook.   He would IM me on there quite a bit when I was on, which was weird cause I never actually talked to him and I don't think he recognized who I was from the parties.       Well I was down at a cafe one night and he called and asked if I wanted to hang out, this was around 1am and he came down. Well he came in and he was smiling and so was I. I felt that instant connection. We stayed up till 5 or 6 am there talking for hours about our lives and our wants in the future. At the time he was seeing someone but was talking about how he wanted it to work out but she was getting very distant. We left and he gave me a couple of hugs -friendly way, nothing more- and we've been friends since.       Well his girlfriend decided she didn't want to be in a relationship with him anymore cause she wasn't ready to settle down. So they broke up. I was there for him the whole time and such as strictly a friend. Then as time went on we ended up sleeping together a couple of times. I knew it was nothing to be going crazy over cause I understood we were just friends and he wasn't with anyone else.    After a few times though I told him "You know. I like you a lot and I cant do this stuff with out you being mine, it hurts too much." And he stated "I like you too but I don't want a relationship right now" and I dropped the idea of us and the physical stuff fast and we're still friends.      He tells me a lot that he misses me and stuff and mentions that he doesn't want to hurt me or sleep with me cause he didn't want to lose me. But this is the thing, I talk to him like a friend. I've set my feelings aside for him. I've gone out on dates and told him and he gets jealous. I'll tell him I'm going to sit around and watch movies with someone and he jumps to conclusions and thinks its a date.      He always wants to hang out too. I'm just not sure what he wants here. He's made it clear he wont push the sex thing on me again. And that we can be friends, but he actually gets angry when I go on a date. We had an argument the other night cause he asked why I don't want to see him right now and I told him "because you want to kiss me and hold me, you do it every time, and it hurts." and he said "you make it out to be like I don't care about you" and I go "I know you do, but you don't want me either, you're wasting your time and I don't know why". He puts a lot of effort into talking to me when I'm upset about him or upset in general. More than a friend would. I just don't get why.   I've gotton over liking him, I always will. But I block him out of my mind a lot more now. I would rather have him a friend than nothing at all. I just don't know why he keeps bothering to care about me like that and tell me that if a guy hurts me what he'll do and stuff. Its just messing with my head.      Anyone have advice? What he might be thinking? He knows how I feel about him, I told him. We're suppose to hang out Friday.    10 points to the most caring and honest answer!
20090205161129AAP7XE8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can ya please help(i posted this and no one answered)?	i talked to this girl for the first day and I ask for her num and she said she doesn't know me that much so she didn't want to give it to me.I saw the next day and I was talking to her and she went inside the restroom and I was standing infront of the restroom and we were talking(we talked for about 3 to 4 minutes)she ask for my name and I told her but she didn't get it.She sometimes sees me on the hallway and walk fast or stares at me like 2 seconds and turns away: so I saw her walking in the hallway after school and I called her and she came over, we started chatting and she said her friend thinks am cute, and I said am not interested,.      She was like I can hook you up,and I said I don't like nobody in the skool I only like one person and she looked deep into my eyes.She told me this guy(rodney) that I know likes her but she doesn't like the guy and she even told me where she lives( we talked for about 10 minutes and I walked her to the main entrance)she really pays attention to whatever I tell her and she gives me all the smiles.She even ask for my name and my grade and she said am cool, am not like the other guys,and I was like are we cool and she said yes but I need to get to know you more.       I really like her, do you think she likes me ?Nb; she finally told rodney she doesn't like rodney but she likes someoneelse and riight know she keeps on pointing at me to her friends whenever I see her. does she likes me or what?      She saw me standing next to my locker and she didn't even say hi, she just walked away and she saw me today and I try not to talk to her and she said, now you don't say hi no more and I said I didn't see her, I also said you don't even talk to me and she said because I don't see you. I ask her so whatz up and she said nothing but what about you and I said nothing and she saw her bus and said bye.       does she like me. we didn't say hi or talk for 1 week and she said hi to me today and I ask her can I walk you to class and she said okay and she was like, I you not going to be late? and I said is nothing and whiles we were taking she was holding her necklace and asking about my classes.i finally ask for her number again and she said her parents are strict and dont allow her to talk on the phone andshe said she hasn't seen me ina while, and i was like i was sick and she said i hope u get better.she also said she knows me know since she said she want to know me?plus she said is cool that we talk, should i just be friends with her, go for it or ignore her?

20090205160011AAqa2TM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I don't like him, so why do I feel this way?	We were sitting next to each other in class.  He's a flirt, a big one.  He even flirts with me, and I'm very, very shy, but I do not like him that way, I know I don't.        Today though, he touched me.  He was rubbing against my leg with his hand... I was pushing his hands away from me from under the table, but when I would he'd put my hands in his and hold them, and he kept playing with me.  I've never felt like this before.  I got like a tingling sensation all over my body, and it was wonderful and weird at the same time.  My entire body started to steam up, I think I started to sweat even, even though it was like 60 degrees in there.     What's even weirder is that I long for him now... and the way he made me feel      I know him touching me like that probably meant nothing to him, since he probably does it to a lot of girls, but to me, it meant a little more.. for some reason.      can someone help me? Im very confused with my emotions.

20090205155458AAApJhv	Family & Relationships;Friends	Stubborn and overprotective friends?	I understand friends looking out for you and stuff like that, but my friends do not even ask the guys name when I say I like someone. They just say "you better watch out, it could be another Sean" (Sean wasn't even that bad, we dated for a year and he got a little clingy, that's all).   And I sit with my friends EVERY day at lunch. If I ask them even days in advance if I can sit with my crush at lunch one day out of the week they get pissed off and act as if I had ditched them.   When I do go end up going out with the guy I like, they act stubborn and are not willing to get to know the guy, they just automatically judge him in a bad way.      What can I do to make them not act like my freaking parents?   No, not my parents. Even they handle my relationships better than my friends do.
20090205163649AAL1f6r	Family & Relationships;Friends	Im confused and don't know what to say or do about this friendship?	My friend and I say we're best friends but i don't feel like its true. It seem i put more into the friendship than her. I have to start everything, talking planning everything basically..she tells me shes not the type to start things. And when i do ask her to hang out she can sometimes but she'll never come to my house. I always have to go to hers. She says she trys to hang out as much as she can but i always find out some how that she's doing something other than what she said she was doing. Her priorities she says is her family and shool. That's not a bad thing but i would think that since we're such good friends i would be in some part of her priorities. She says i don't accept her as she is but i feel i do, all i ever ask of her is time to hang out. Im going in the navy in two weeks and still she ditches me.Shes known for a long time about me leaving. And i just found out that just recently shes going with her cousin to look at a college, the week before i leave. When she told me will find some way to hang out before i leave, cause school is her life. Im just confused, cause she never shows emotion.      And no im not stalking, or smothering her.I always say to her dont let me bother you then, she says if it bothered her she'd tell me. Ill see her maybe once in a while. Cuase its up to me to start everything she says. And i get tired of having to plan everything. A few weeks ago i just stopped talking to her to see if she would start up the converstaions and nothing.         I told her we need to talk but i dont know where to start or what to say.

20090205160526AAWAqXC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Complicated Infatuation...?	Ok Ladies and Gentlemen(Looking for a feminine answer mainly but guys,more than welcome) Brace yourselves,for this is s somewhat long situation:      *For privacy's sake all names will be switched!*      I have been best friends with this girl (sally) since kindergarten. We are both 16 now. We are extremely close, but been getting closer lately.   Problem with that is, she had been dating this kid (alex) for two years.   About 3 weeks ago, she had broken up with him for two main reasons.      #1. She had lost feelings for him and didn't want to lead him on by pretending she didn't have something going on in her mind.   #2. She had apparently had a crush on someone else, a week later after found out she didn't like him anyways and that was all.      Now I've talked to her about ALL of this, she had told me a few times that she somewhat regretted dumping her boyfriend,and still had feelings for him. BUT here's where it gets even more complicated...      Within those 3 weeks or so, we have been acting like WE are a couple. We've hung out A LOT. We hold hands, we talk on the phone almost every night, we cuddle when we sit together, and on two occasions we've kissed. I told her about last week I had feelings for her. She said she appreciates me telling her and she might have feelings back. But worried that those feelings were  rebound emotions.      AND NOW: her boyfriend asked her back out, she asked me for advice, why?I'm not sure. But I told her "If we were dating, my goal would be to make you happy, and if going back out with him makes you happy, it will make me happy. It will sting at one point, but if it's what you want, I can't stop you"   She claims I'm the "sweetest guy ever and loves me for that"      She is now going back out with him, and for some reason I can't stand it. I have had so many emotions going through my mind lately. I've lost countless hours of sleep, losing all concentration and I have yet to feel happiness recently.I'm not sure what to do or how to feel.      I'm terribly sorry for the long question/situation. I wanted to give as much information as possible so answerer's can understand my situation.   If you made it this far down THANK YOU VERY MUCH! You don't understand how appreciative I am if you took the time to read ALL of this.    Once again,thank you very much!
20090205155243AAudK2u	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should i get my boyfrind for his 16th birthday? helpp ! its in 10 days !!?	N/A
20090205155138AAbngwJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	URGENT! Please answer A.S.A.P. 10 points to the best answer given.?	OK, so after school, I was supposed to meet my boyfriend so we can hang out and stuff. But, I got side-tracked with the time. I was in the school computer lab with my friends and then the last time I checked the time, it was 5:40. I was supposed to meet him 40 minutes ago! So, I went with my buddy, Sydney, to just prance around the school and guess who I bump into? My boyfriend! He was really pissed off at me. My friend was holding my down because I was running after him to explain. Then when I finally got out of her power grip, I went to talk to him. I was on the ground from struggling so much and he looked down at me and said, "You got three minutes to explain." and as my friend tried to drag me away, I held onto the walls and explained to him. I said: "Well, I did what you asked and what we agreed on! I waited upstairs!" and he said. "All the way upstairs!" And we got into an argument. Now my other friend is suggesting I talk to him over the phone about this but I'm too scared. I know he's just going to give me the silent treatment and it's just going to make me feel as though I'm talking to myself for a whole five minutes or whatever. So, back to the scene: I finished explaining and he just rolled his eyes, picked up his bag and walked off. So, any ideas on what I should do to try explaining to him again or maybe even talking him into his senses even though 99% of this is my fault?

20090205155149AA0UuN4	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should i be friends with her?	she's my bff of course   and she's really nice and funny with me.   but she kinda thinks like she's all that.   and popularity is important to her, which i don't like.   she's really really rude, and disrespectly to people who aren't her bff.   i'll tell her, that it was mean, or that she doesn't need to spazz on people.   but she'll be like,   nobody likes him/her,   i'm just joking.      but really,   i don't think him/her thinks it's a joke.
20090205155158AALWHcM	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How you think this is going to play out?	To make it short.   I ****** up many times, she got tired of me fell out of love.   We loved ea other immensely but now her Rich *** Mom ( who has never been there 4 her since she was 13) came out of nowhere and is telling her to end this rltnshp and brain-washing her. She was leaving home while I was on Vacation and I changed my plane ticket and came back b4 she was gone. She says:    I tried the following:    * begging.   * Crying like a baby.   * trying to make sense out of this.   * showing her that she would loose everything, car, house, and the money I give her to buy crap at the mall.   * Even I found her a room to show her how crappy is to live renting a room in a family's house.    She answered:   * Our sex life is great but..   * I love u like a brother....   * I don't love u anymore....   * I don't want to b w/ you..   * She also agreed that her mother was giving her "advise".      Then this morning we FINALLY spoke openly w/ hearts open.    We agreed:   * to Live 2gether like roommates.   * to give ea other time and space.   * I'm not going to take away her new car and Ph, and she can still live w/ me in a upscale neighborhood.   * and that within a year we may do different ways.     This is the catch, I'm going to use this time to try to really make it up to her, I can't loose her right now without fighting a little..    I know she loves me 4 sure, but she is depressed and going through something, so I just want to let her B herself and truly find out what her feelings truly are. Meanwhile I'll keep everything under control and won;t loose her for ever. I can't afford to do that because she is the only person in this life I really want to be with. I've dated many times b4 but she is the love of my life 4 sure no doubt and we are meant for ea other.      How you thing this is going to play out?

20090205161139AAbY0xq	Family & Relationships;Friends	Ladies, how did i do when writing this girl on match.com?  did i say too much?	hey, my name is mike and I have lived in ___ for nearly 20 years. I graduated in 2004 from the University of ___ and I have lived in ____ since graduation. Even though I went to __ , I'm a big bulls fan. I love to tailgate with my dad and friends during football season and have some good memories of this since I was a little kid! I think its pretty cool you have been to europe. My dream is to go visit sometime. What was your favorite place to visit in Europe?      I liked what you have to say in your profile. I'm tired of going out and doing the whole party scene. I enjoy going out with friends but its not the best way to meet people. I like meeting new people but you meet alot of wrong people this way. Im looking for someone who is honest and trusting. Those 2 traits i value the greatest. Friendship is also important and key for a healthy commitment!       So you like to experience different beer, whats your fav drink and place to have a drink?         *** so how was it too much? i mentioned tailgating bc there was a pic of her tailgating for the same college team i tailgate for. im not the best at knowing what to write. should i be more direct in getting together and meeting?  the girl i wrote is 25

I got home today and my mom is angry with me for going. Asking me like: Why did you go? or saying things like this: I haven't told your father. If this is that serious we need to tell him (My dad really doesn't like me going there, I went there last year and he got mad at me). I don't know what to do!! My mom is mad at me and now my dad will be. What do i do?!
