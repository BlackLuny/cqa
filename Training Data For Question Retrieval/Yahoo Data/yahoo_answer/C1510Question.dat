Please tell stories that happened to YOU not someone else with any experience. Remember, ghosts are real they are not fake or anything.       Let me tell you two stories:      1). My dad's uncle was drivivng in the woods one day in his car with some of his brothers or something, and it was night. Suddenly, behind their car, a white figure started to follow them. The people in the car saw it, and naturally got extremely frightened. My dad's uncle and everyone started to pray to GOD, and said "Om Sainathaya Namah" (we are indian that is why and my dad's uncle was a great devotee of Shree Sai Baba Ji), and as soon as they uttered that manthra, the white figured disappeared so quickly and suddenly.       This is not a ghost story, however it is still a spiritual/miracle kind of story:      2). My mother's uncle or grandfather or someone was riding his bycycle through the woods and was returning home, however int his dense jungle he lost his way and could not find the way back to home. Suddenly, an elderly man appeared out of nowhere, and he too was on a bycicle. He told my mother's grandfather to follow him, and soon my grandfather arrived upon his home! The elderly man had helped him find his way back home. When my mother's grandfather turned around to thank the elderly man, he had vanished. To this day, and forever onwards, our family has believed that the man was GOD himself, or maybe someone of GOD who came on earth to help my mother's grandfather.

I've never partied a lot and when I have, it has mostly been house parties or maybe just hanging out with a group of friends at a bar.  Anyway, I went "clubbing" with a large group of girls yesterday and it was awful.  Basically, all we did was dance and smelly, drunk guys tried to grope us.  I felt like I spent the whole night trying to get away from this strange guy who wouldn't leave me alone.  Also, the germs!  Everybody is all drunk and in such close quarters, ugh.  I hated it and just don't understand the appeal.  I kept thinking how I would rather be at home or at least out somewhere where you can actually hear other people talk and have some sort of conversation.

It's like I'm constantly changing my mind of who I am. One day I want to be a girl, then there are days where I feel like I'd be better off as a boy.

20090307154414AAnGR6m	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Roman Catholic Canon Laws make reference to "Divine Law" -- Is this a higher authority?	This is part of a series of question that have been prompted by previous questions.       In following misty0408's response and reading some of the Canon Laws, I came across this: "Civil laws to which the law of the Church yields are to be observed in canon law with the same effects, insofar as they are not contrary to divine law and unless canon law provides otherwise." It appears from this statement that "divine law" is superior in authority to canon law, or am I misreading the statement? I realize that the statement refers to civil (man-made) laws, but I have to wonder, since divine law is called out, which of the two (canon law or divine law) is the higher authority. Feel free to link me to any statement within the canon law that addresses the question. The statement is the bottom statement at this link:  http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__...

Ich h?re gern Radio in der Nacht. Im Prinzip, spielt es keine Rolle was für ein Lied auf Sendung ist. Das Nachtradio macht eine besondere Atmosph?re. Ich hasse es wenn ich morgen früh aufstehen muss. Ich liebe die Nacht. Ich hasse die Einsamkeit, aber ich denke, dass die Einsamkeit liebt mich.      In unserer Welt passiert es oft so: Vom Anfang an wir lieben irgendetwas nicht, oder wir sind neutral, oder sogar hassen, aber wenn die Zeit vorbei sind, sagen wir zu uns selbst: ’Verdammt I habe das geliebt.’      Ich interessiere mich für Psychologie. Man kann tausende Mathe Aufgaben l?sen, und die L?sung wird pr?zise, logisch und klar, aber die Beziehung zwischen den Menschen, deren Benehmen und solche Sachen werden immer unklar.

20090307153520AA5ykNq	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Did you know that Catholics...?	Catholics make a comparison between The Ark of the Covenant and the body of Mary while she was carrying, and for having carried Jesus. This is one of the reasons why it is wrong to speak against Mary being the mother of God; you would be speaking against God's ark..   Seems to me that this keeps them in an invalid fear of going against Catholic doctrine.       I feel sorry for Catholics, members of Gospel Outreach, JW's, Mormons, Baptists, Pentecostals, Episcopalians, Lutherans, Muslims, Buddhists and all other people who have been indoctrinated and held captive by such doctrines.        Yes, the ark was the place where the priests went to perform religious duties. This was God's will. But God spoke to Moses and the prophets wherever he found them. God was not contained in the ark. Do you think that God was fully contained in the fetus of Jesus as he was forming or was God forming the fetus? Catholics take a verse here and there and make comparisons and then create doctrine with them.       Satan used scripture to tempt Jesus. If a young believer would have been standing there listening, he may have agreed with Satan when he said, “If you are the son of God, throw yourself down. For as it is written, 'He will give his angels charge over you least you stub your foot against a stone' ”. But Jesus replied, “It is also written, 'You shall not tempt the Lord your God' “.      Scripture is misused and misquoted all the time by religious leaders. The Catholic leaders and many others use scriptures to create God in their own image. I will continue to point at it whenever I see it.    this is another example of your Catholic (one plus one equals two) reasoning. Someone came up with this (idea) five or six hundred years ago (I don't know) and since then it has been handed down as truth and apparently swallowed whole by the mass.       God's reasoning is beyond quantum physics. Be led by the spirit not by human reasoning.      I keep hearing the Catholics on here say that we Protestants assume we know your hearts on various matters. Well, I see equal assumptions coming from this same group regarding Mary. I don't know of any Protestant in my circle of brothers and sisters in the Lord who don't recognize Mary as a great figure and a blessed woman just as scriptures say. We know that she said that all women will call her blessed. She was extremely blessed. So was Noah, Abraham, Moses, Joshua, John the Baptist, the apostles...       It looks very ugly, sickening, even grotesque to those of us who have been born again into the body of Christ by the calling of God our Savior (apart from Catholicism), to see the reversal of honor in the title “Mother of God” . By constantly claiming Mary as the Mother of God, you lessen the importance of “God The Father”.   God formed the Holy Child not Mary. God was not in Mary the way a child is when it is being formed.   He was still ruling the universe and it was God who was forming the Child Jesus all along. And when Mary was in her mothers womb, It was our God and Father who was forming her. The same with her mother before her. So the obvious great truth is that God is the Lord, Savior and Father of Mary. Any other claim or chant is ludicrous and heretical.      How often, in any of your mases, do you refer to her as the blessed daughter of God? This is closer to the eternal truth, to a degree that can't be measured.       If you have teachings apart from Holy Scriptures, which explain this odd twist of identities, I have no faith in them. My faith, which was given me by the Lord, is completely spent on him. I am guided by the Holy Spirit into the truth of the Holy Scriptures.      Here's a question for you; If you make the comparison of Mary's body carrying Jesus, equal to the ark of the covenant, as you do, does this mean that we are all, now, equal to the ark of the covenant? Then we are equal to Mary.      Blessed be the name of the Lord MOST HIGH!!!!!!   There is no other!!!!!!   The name of Jesus is above every name, which is named!!!!!!!   Hallelujah!!!!!!! He is King!!!!!!!      Oh wait! But if Jesus is King and Mary is Queen... Let's not go there. And if God is the Father and Mary is the Mother of God and Jesus is the son of God and Jesus is the King and...       As it is written in the Gospel of John; Jesus was in the beginning with God and all things that exist were created through him and nothing was created without him.      Doesn't say anything about an eternal Mary. It says that Jesus is the creator of Mary.   Kinda messes with your Catholic reasoning doesn't it?      Be free of religion! Put your faith in God alone through the gift of faith given to us through and by Jesus Christ. That goes for you protestants and other religious people as well.      So, my question is, Did you know that about Catholics and what do you think?

20090307155007AAzstaw	Society & Culture;Languages	Is 'dramatic sense' comprehensible?	Hello, everyone      I’m not a native speaker of English. I have to translate a passage from Japanese into English. Would you help me translate it?      What I translated is:   “A lot of people say that dialogue is important, but if they think that mere chatting is dialogue, they are seriously mistaken. In order to dialogue, we need a dramatic sense which makes us understand the situation. If two people without this sense discuss a complicated matter, they will start fighting each other.”      I translated a part in the original literally as ‘a dramatic sense’. By the words I mean a sense which is the ability needed in watching a drama, or a sense which enables us understand a conflicting situation as it is in a drama. Is the expression ’a dramatic sense’ comprehensible?  And if there are any mistakes, would you mind correcting them?

He only seems to go for transsexuals and women only.    This is what I thought:       Gay was only liking someone of the same sex and not liking the opposite sex...      Bi was liking both men and women alike...      And straight is only liking members of the opposite sex...

I got a letter from my friend in France and he wasn't supposed to write back in French ( :( ) He was supposed to write back in English so of course when I opened my letter, I was surprised that I could only read a little over half of it.

20090307111919AAUQrWX	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Is the rise in the gay lifestyle a testament to the failure of hetersexuals to sell their lifestyle properly?	On the face of things, being gay is obviously so much better than being straight, but for time immemorial the hetersexuals have somehow been able to sell their lifestyle to the masses. Quite how anyone can be persuaded to give up huge amounts of money and time to bring up children is beyond me. Yet many people do it. This demonstrates that the hetero's marketing machine is very effective and efficient.   So why has it not been working so well of late?
20090227071019AAXUxPX	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Isn't Scientology kind of obviously a scam?

I'm sorry, where does it appear that Scientology is in any way true? Look at all the evidence against it. L.Ron Hubbard was charged for stealing $200 million dollars from his so-called 'church', died in hiding from a drug overdose, which is exactly what his 'church' fought against.

20090227071047AAjOoie	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What's wrong with encouraging the non-altruistic to do good acts with a promise of less time in purgatory?	I'm sincerely interested in why people would take issue with the Catholic church selling get-out-of-purgatory in less time cards in exchange for good deeds, with or without the addition of a donation to the church.      I mean, if you believe in purgatory, and you believe the catholic church is capable of making such a bargain, and you're willing to do the good deeds in exchange for this thing, then what is wrong with it?      I've worked with homeless shelters and food pantries, and I assure you that such places need bodies on the ground and money in the bank, and they don't care if you're doing it out of the goodness of your heart, because your high school requires community service to graduate, to get out of a weekend in prison or because you think it cuts your time in purgatory.

The Daughter of Jerusalem           tosses her head as you flee.  22 Who is it you have insulted and blasphemed?           Against whom have you raised your voice           and lifted your eyes in pride?           Against the Holy One of Israel!     23 By your messengers           you have heaped insults on the Lord.           And you have said,           "With my many chariots           I have ascended the heights of the mountains,           the utmost heights of Lebanon.           I have cut down its tallest cedars,           the choicest of its pines.           I have reached its remotest parts,           the finest of its forests.        24 I have dug wells in foreign lands           and drunk the water there.           With the soles of my feet           I have dried up all the streams of Egypt."        25 " 'Have you not heard?           Long ago I ordained it.           In days of old I planned it;           now I have brought it to pass,           that you have turned fortified cities           into piles of stone.        26 Their people, drained of power,           are dismayed and put to shame.           They are like plants in the field,           like tender green shoots,           like grass sprouting on the roof,           scorched before it grows up.        27 " 'But I know where you stay           and when you come and go           and how you rage against me.        28 Because you rage against me           and your insolence has reached my ears,           I will put my hook in your nose           and my bit in your mouth,           and I will make you return           by the way you came.'        29 "This will be the sign for you, O Hezekiah:           "This year you will eat what grows by itself,           and the second year what springs from that.           But in the third year sow and reap,           plant vineyards and eat their fruit.        30 Once more a remnant of the house of Judah           will take root below and bear fruit above.        31 For out of Jerusalem will come a remnant,           and out of Mount Zion a band of survivors.          The zeal of the LORD Almighty will accomplish this.        32 "Therefore this is what the LORD says concerning the king of Assyria:           "He will not enter this city           or shoot an arrow here.           He will not come before it with shield           or build a siege ramp against it.        33 By the way that he came he will return;           he will not enter this city,           declares the LORD.        34 I will defend this city and save it,           for my sake and for the sake of David my servant."        35 That night the angel of the LORD went out and put to death a hundred and eighty-five thousand men in the Assyrian camp. When the people got up the next morning—there were all the dead bodies! 36 So Sennacherib king of Assyria broke camp and withdrew. He returned to Nineveh and stayed there.        37 One day, while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer cut him down with the sword, and they escaped to the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son succeeded him as king.

20090307112603AAoIkeP	Society & Culture;Etiquette	What do I do about a gift subscription to a magazine I now dislike?	My mother's been giving me a subscription to "Canadian Living" for years, if not decades.  (Similar to "Ladies Home Journal", e.g.)      Until the last year or so, I've found it a really good source of all kinds of ideas for better living.  But they seem to have new editor(s) or something. Now, most issues have things I consider offensive, if not dangerous.  I have written the magazine, giving (middle-of-the-road) reasons for objecting, but have seen no response, either direct or indirect. So, I've given up.       I'd like to write, cancelling my subscription, but I don't know how to go about it. Should I ask for a refund? Should I ask them to send her a refund? Should I tell her at all?      I don't want to be rude to her: her gift started with good energy; it's the magazine & my attitudes that have changed.       But I don't want her to waste her money on a magazine I no longer want. (In fact, the environmental waste involved in receiving anything I don't want is strongly offensive to me.)      I'm tempted to ask her to give a donation to "Changing the Present", a site oriented to people who want to make a gift without generating more junk. Instead, a person makes a contribution to a charity of their choice, in the name of the honoured person, who receives a card saying so. (That was an un-authorized advertisement!)       But I think that telling (or even suggesting) what kind of gift I want from someone (unless they ask, directly) is really rude!      Any way out of this bind?

20090227065509AAyO9H2	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Iran/Muslims leading in medical research/stem cell research. Will supercede USA. T or F?	Iran investing in stem cells      Thirty years after the toppling of the Shah in Iran, the nation is undergoing another revolution of sorts. Iran is investing heavily in stem cell research, and despite researchers working with limited access to laboratory equipment and resources, the country may emerge as a scientific force to be reckoned with in the stem cell field.         Even with their limited infrastructure, Iranian scientists have managed to isolate six human and eight mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) lines over the past decade, and then successfully turn these cells into functional pancreatic, heart, splenic, and liver cells. "It's remarkable that they were able to do what they've done," Konrad Hochedlinger of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital told The Scientist. "They are clearly catching up."      Unlike many western countries, where religious wranglings have hindered the progress of ESC research, in Iran and other Islamic countries research involving embryos is relatively uncontroversial. Islamic law states that full human life begins only after the "ensoulment" of the fetus, which is defined in the Quran as 120 days after conception. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, even publicly endorsed human embryo research in 2002.      -The Scientist Magazine

20090307115216AAGlifX	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Are there clubs or meetings where a single guy can hook up or learn to date?	I am a single guy recently moved here from the South.  Although I am good looking and make descent money, I find myself challenged in the sexual experience department.  Most women in my old area were repressed, marriage obsessed ladies.  There was no dating scene.  People were paired up at a ridiculously young age by social circumstance.  So, I find myself lacking sexual experience and dating graces in Minneapolis.  Is there a club, organization, sub culture, etc that I could join for sex or dating advice?  Swingers clubs don't want single guys hanging around, of course, and craigslist is dangerous.   I used to think that men without female company were losers whose moms kept them around too many comic books.  But, I see there is a cultural divide for me to cross. Women are so independent here and social graces so formal and standoffish.  What do I do? Please no empty advice.  Looking for something a little more tangible.

20090307121848AAyaX0C	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	LGBT: Would you let yourself be someone else's experiment?	I ask because I have a bit of a situation... this guy I know from school basically asked me if I wanted to "do stuff" with him. I'm not sure what to say. I've had offers of sex from "straight" guys before, but I've always said no. But that was mostly because I had a on-off friend/boyfriend at the time.      So normally I would say no, but he is incredibly hot. I mean seriously. I don't know if I could forgive myself if I turned him down! But then on the other hand I have morals... And I'm not really a fan of meaningless sex, but in this case...      Also, no one has ever asked me when we're sober before. It's always been when they're extremely wasted. So maybe that means he's bi or something? Or am I just getting my hopes up?

20090227082702AAQ6lh9	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheists, how do you explain Paul correctly prophesying about Scientology?	As in, Paul said:      "Now the Spirit speaks expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils: Speaking lies in hypocrisy: Having their conscience seared with a hot iron.."            And as you can see, the spirit was right, because at that time, all there was, was Pagans, Jews, and then Christians. Now today, we have all this weird stuff like scientology, and then of course things like Temple Garments, which God clearly doesn't care about you wearing anything, for he doesn't dwell in garments anyway. ^_^         But anyway, how did Paul, speaking with the spirit as he said, correctly prophesy about the religions of today?

So im Bi actually, still in the closet and Loove this guy  'Jay'.        We used to be friends in 10th grade and everything was going good, then he started giving me all this attention and got all touchy feely, blah blah. THEN in 11th grade i started making INTENSE (NOT PSYCHO) eye contact and he kept it until i looked away. He never mean faced me or anything liek that.         So me like a dumb*ss, started playing hard to get and basically ingored him walking to classes, and didnt look at him or anything like that.     Now he does the same and it's killing me. He prolly doesn't care but idk i SWEAR i thought he did, and i wasn't being delusional.       Like two weeks ago he was behind me in the lunch line, he didn't say anything to me till i turned around and said          " You cant talk nomore"??    He said  "No", but then he said " i mean yea" and he was nervous cuz that was the first time we actually talked in a while. =( Then he said "Where's the green at, the weed" idk, i guess to start a convo cuz it was silent for a while lol. Then a friend interrupted us and we started talking to her. So that was that.      Yesterday at school, i left my class and was in the hallway, and he came out his class which is right next door. And we didn't say ANYTHING to each other. We were just looking away. (there was other people in the hall too, but neither of us were taling to them).. He was right in front of me like 7 ft away and didnt say nothing....So [what's his deal]??      [P.S Im ALMOST POSITIVE HE"S NOT A HOMOPHOBE]      So yea what's his deal?? Thanks in advance!! Im in the closet and DONT wanna come out yet till im with him!!

20090307133709AAFysKz	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Im an atheist, can any of u christians help me!?	i need help, my parents are christians, my dad is a pastor and i was a christian till i was about 13. i began to think that religion was a way to make people feel happy, to help them believe that something is wathcing over them when there really isnt. i feel god is like a fairy tale character and heavan and hell are just myths made up by people long ago. i believe a man named jesus probably did exist but he was just one of those crazies saying he was the son of god. i feel really alone, like there is this void in me, i want to believe but i just cant. i need serious help, everyone around me believes in god and are so happy, or seem to be and i just cant, when my dad talks about god i just roll my eyes, what he says sounds ridiculous, he says god loves u and cares about u and everything will be taken care of by him all i have to do is trust him. wtf! i cant! how does he effin watch everyone at the same time, im very logical and scientific, my college major is biochemistry and biomed engineering and there is nooooo way anyone can tell me that there is no evolution or that god created the earth because i know he didnt. what can i do, just accept my atheistic viewpoint and move on, how could i possibly become a christian if im struggling so much?

20090227081220AAm27sp	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What does this verse mean?	23 By your messengers    you have heaped insults on the Lord.    And you have said,    "With my many chariots (it should say horses rather than chariots)    I have ascended the heights of the mountains,    the utmost heights of Lebanon.    I have cut down its tallest cedars,    the choicest of its pines.    I have reached its remotest parts,    the finest of its forests.      27 " 'But I know where you stay    and when you come and go    and how you rage against me.       28 Because you rage against me    and your insolence has reached my ears,    I will put my hook in your nose    and my bit in your mouth,    and I will make you return    by the way you came.'      a) How is he raging against the Lord?   b)  How has he “heaped insults against the lord”   c)  Where does he mean, I know when you come and go and how you rage against me?       32 "Therefore this is what the LORD says concerning the king of Assyria:    "He will not enter this city (product or exchange or socialization)    or shoot an arrow here. (pierce his heart)    He will not come before it with shield (no defense)   or build a siege ramp against it.       35 That night the angel of the LORD went out and put to death 185 000 in the Assyrian camp. When the people got up the next morning—there were all the dead bodies!      1 is destiny ; 8 is wealth; 5 is power (Puts an end to his destiny and power and wealth)       37 One day, while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer cut him down with the sword, and they escaped to the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son succeeded him as king. (Ararat is where the ark of Noah landed after the flood)       Read the entire book if you need the context.

20090307130835AAeqzjf	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Mormons: Did your church lie to us?	In October of 2008, the LDS church while proactively urging all its American members to do all they can to pass proposition 8 in California, restricting valid marriage to only one man and one woman, stated that it is not the church's intention to fight civil unions, only marriage equality, and that the church does not oppose to, as a matter of public policy, the recognition of same-sex civil unions.      Now today, I read that the LDS Church has been disseminating e-mails among its Illinois members to fight pro-civil union state legislation.        https://www.hrc.org/12229.htm       I can't seem to find any definitive proof that this is indeed happening, and I'm curious to know if you have any wisdom to share with us. So far, I can only find evidence that this e-mail has been disseminated by a local Bishop, and not the from the Salt Lake hierarchy, leading me to believe that the church has not explicitly lied to us.      On the other hand, I would think that a Bishop (who functions in the capacity of the official church for at least his ward) should be reprimanded, at the very least, for using a church e-mail service to disseminate information misleadingly incongruous with the overall church's stance to the ward's network of members. Essentially, is he not misrepresenting your church's explicitly stated position of neutrality? If not, how can any of us trust the word of your church's hierarchy?

20090227075724AAzzAZn	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do people say they reject The BIBLE because it is not logical?	Why do people say they reject The BIBLE because it is not logical      Is it logical to believe that nothing exploded and made everything...   Is it logical to believe that everything just happen to be just right, for the galaxies to form...   Is it logical to believe that all life, plant, animal, and people come from random chemicals...   Is it logical to believe that DNA appeared from nothing, that in one generation, there would be 23 chromosomes, and the next there would be 24 with no input from an outside source...   Is it logical to believe that evolution scientist are right about the ages of  rocks and bones, when there is 100% failure on every test were the dates are already known...   Is it logical to reject The BIBLE because it is not logical?      To those that ask if stuff in the BIBLE is logical, no it is not. I freely acknowledge that.   But the BIBLE is not about logic, it is about GOD(YHVH), and human logic does not apply to HIM. If we can modify something we make, why can’t HE modify a donkey so it can talk? As for the snake, The BIBLE says that GOD(YHVH) can understand all languages, and Adam and Eve were perfect, so why assume Adam and Eve could only communicate with each other but not with the animals...

20090227083201AAmUv3o	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What do you think this passage means, Luke 9:49-50?	"Master," said John, "we saw a man driving out demons in your name and we tried to stop him, because he is not one of us".       "Do not stop him," Jesus said, "for whoever is not against you is for you".      What did Jesus mean?      For me, it is clear that Jesus is not even a bit concerned about who you are or what religion you have, as long as you are helping others with the abilities you have.      In my religion, we make contacts with spirits and Christians don't think it is a Christian thing to do, so what about what Jesus said above?

Only at times when people would knock and enter would things bust loose. some invited in were tripped up at the entry way, some were pushed back through the door without my leaving my chair. there were others who once have allowed to open my door, saying it was too cold. Left, before comming in!( i always kept my thermostat at 70 deg. f.)   The reason why I say we, last night John had his first taste of this also.   The cap of a tube of modeling glue was left off, near a thing  which would have ignited it, my inhaler given to me to help recover from walking pnemumia was move from the bedroom to a more obvious place. John doesn't stumble going up our staircase, others are tripped or stumble at our second floor landing!

That question could be misleading...lol....let me explain:   I'm at work (I know Saturdays suck for me) and every so often I look out the window and see this guy who looks like this guy I used to work with Matt. Matt is straight and very good looking and when we had the same whift together we were trouble, inseparable, sparring on the sales floor; typical brother stuff. But today I've been seeing him everywhere and it's not him...it's not even the same look-a-like. It's a different guy every time. Why am I thinking of this guy..it's been like.....ew 9 years??   Could it possibly be fate or whoever graces their presence on screwing with my life to contact him? Bored at work and just curious...a little creeped out too.    Any thoughts?
20090307133849AAKBw31	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Are all Germans like this?	I currently work in Germany where I've been for 6 months and I having a rough time of it. The people at my company, nearly all young or middle aged Germans apart from one American guy and one Spanish girl, are so unfriendly. Even though I have fluent German, nobody wants to talk to me or include me in anything apart from the American guy who is 15 years older than me and not exactly someone who I can hang out with. We went out for a meal at Christmas and some of the people were literally staring at me. Every time I see a colleague in the town they totally ignore me. I am starting to think they are enjoying treating me like this, knowing I am lonely here, and making me suffer. I have enrolled on some evening courses but the people there are all very middle aged. I also find Germans in general kind of unfriendly people (in shops or on the bus etc.). If I had known that it was like this here I would NEVER have come but what with the credit crunch getting a job back home is proving impossible and I can't go home without a job because I have no savings. I hate it here and I'm at my wit's end.

Especially if they are questions by conservatives, QUESTIONING  liberal issues in anyway. I mean the whole point of YA is to ask questions, and.or give answers. Liberals get so upset about any question that may challenge there orthodoxy.Kind of reminds me of some other countries that determine what questions are "appropriate" and which are not. After all liberals have historically been the proponents of free speech, and inquiry.    They  (liberals)were known for the idea   " I disagree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it"    Instead of discussing issues, Libs (or marxists) will sink down to personal attacks, name calling, label throwing, will go off on rants that has nothing to do with your question (even though they may think it does) and will accuse you of terrible things based on a question you asked. If you libs want no freedom of speech or inquiry go to North Korea, or Iran.

Afrikaans is rarely taught much outside of Afrikaans schools and even in an Afrikaner school English as a subject is studied for longer than Afrikaans is. Apartheid is to blame for this. Due to the encouragement on being able to speak Afrikaans in the past many black native people grew to resent the language and therefore stood against it but the complete opposite is happening now and the language is dying, This is very sad and need’s to be stopped now.

Afrikaans and German are also very similar because they both come from the same family of Germanic languages. You can see the similarities easily for example I will say a something in Afrikaans and then In German and let’s see how similar they seem.

Many of us like to complain about being stereotyped or people assuming things about us. but before we judge the person who has that misconception of us, shouldnt we look to see why they may have it?      Take me for example, most people would think Im a white american as opposed to a mexican american. I could complain about how people are "ignorant and stupid" but you dont see too many white mexicans working in the fields or mowing grasses.      or for example lets talk about stereotypes, shouldn't we also look at how many people of our race or ethnic background actually fit them? I mean if 85% of a certain group of people listen to such and such music and we happen to be one of the 15% shouldn't we also realize that they wont come across too many of us?      in other words for those of us who are exceptions to stereotypes, shouldn't we think about how many of us there are in comparison to those who fit the stereotypes? you know before we judge the person who has the misconception about us shouldnt we also put ourselves in their shoes and maybe see where they're coming from?

20090307152401AARS5qz	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Are there religious VIP’s at one end, atheists at the other, battling for control over a puppy in the middle?	I’m using a puppy as a euphemism for society. The analogy I picture is a puppy in the middle of a hallway with its two owners at either end. Both the owners are calling the puppy and they both have some treats for the puppy and it’s up to the puppy to decide which owner it will go to. In this analogy, the two owners represent religious leaders and atheists and the puppy represents the commoners in society or the drooling hordes of yokels or the consumers of products that keep capitalist systems functioning.       This ‘puppy calling’ has been going on for thousands of years and for thousands of years, religious leaders have always won out over the atheists because the puppy is inherently irrational, inherently lazy, prone to fear responses and easily, so easily manipulated. All atheists have to lure the puppy with is science and the reality that the puppy is just an animal, this is a random universe and that the puppy is on its own with no higher power looking out for it. Religious people lure the puppy with promises of heaven, the hope of a fool in a higher power and if these don’t work, there is also a threat if hell to be used as a last resort.      But I think there’s been a shift in the last couple of centuries; I think the puppy is starting to pay attention to the atheists at least for a little longer before it inevitably goes to the religious end of the hallway. The puppy is starting to see that it’s being manipulated by the religious VIP’s and that even though what the atheists say doesn’t make the puppy feel special and loved, it is starting to see that the truth the atheists are talking about can only be ignored for so long. Do you think soon there will come a day when the puppy will come to the atheists?
20090307143815AAjtMFx	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Does the very act of being religious contradict the core principles of science?	Religious people basically believe a bunch of stuff that is without evidence. I wish I could make it sound less condescending for you, dear religious people, but that’s the cold truth as I see it. There is no evidence for your beliefs in gods, sacrificial saviors, angels and afterlife scenarios etc, but you guys believe it is real regardless of evidence.      One of the core principles of science is to never believe or assume something is fact unless there is evidence. In fact, ‘belief’ is a word that scientists tend to shy away from because it carries with it implications of a lack of adequate research.      So, by choosing to believe religious stuff, have religious people chosen to reject science?
20090307144853AAhRK1Q	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Does evolution indicate that the universe is essentially an ongoing chain of completely random events?	In fact, does every discovery made in science indicate that the universe is essentially an ongoing chain of completely random events? Therefore, to be a proper scientist, the simplest explanation is that the universe is an ongoing chain of random events. Even though there’s no evidence to prove it, there’s also no evidence to disprove it but the only alternative to a random universe is that there is some higher power controlling stuff, but this is not the simplest explanation and it carries with it assumptions, implications and complications that create more questions than they answer. So, if a proper scientist is going to believe anything at all about the origin of the universe and the universe as it is now, an ongoing chain of random events is the best belief for that scientist, right?
20090307141721AAJ80lO	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheists: how do you respond when religious people challenge you with, “How do you think the universe began?”?	Do you think religious people have an advantage by answering that question simply with “God did it!” whereas an atheist can either say, “I don’t know,” which implies ignorance and apathy or if the atheist does try to explain it, it’s a very long winded explanation with many scientific terms and philosophical conundrums and during the explanation, the atheist thinks, “Why am I bothering explaining this to this guy? He doesn’t understand me! He’s going to keep believing in his god and his ridiculous book that he thinks his god wrote!”?
20090307142655AA3h8ul	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Does saying “The universe is controlled by laws,” imply that the laws were there before the universe?	You know what I mean? It’s like saying, “Ok, we’re going to make a universe today. We need matter and energy, but before we can throw together these ingredients, we need some laws for them otherwise they’ll just crash and bump into each other and instead of a universe, we’ll just have a big mess.” What’s wrong with saying, “The laws regarding the physical properties of all matter and energy within the universe came into being at the same instant in time as the universe itself came into being, therefore, there is no order in the universe; stuff essentially just happens, not for any reason or to achieve any purpose; it just happens”?
20090307143853AAeJWCy	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Are believers telling me that Christ sent the Apostles out on the Great Commission without knowing the Gospel?

And moreover, Christ was also speaking along those lines (the tree was about to dry up... and "weep not for me but for yourself and for your children.")      But I was told that the Apostles didn't know that the Crucifixion was "good news" until the Holy Spirit zapped them at the Pentecost.      Now hold on just a minute.       Are they telling me that Christ sent the Apostles out to preach the Gospel to all mankind before they knew what the gospel was?

20090307144330AAlxQ71	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, without resorting to using scripture, why do you think a book proves the existence of your god?	This is something I really don't get.  How can a book prove anything without something to back it up, like evidence?  Shouldn't this mean Harry Potter is real?  Why use scripture to "prove" your god?  That proves nothing other than you've read the book.  That doesn't make it true.  If you say "I feel god", well, muslims feel Allah, Hindus feel Ganesha, Pagans feel Freyja, etc, so that's not proof of anything either.

20090307151052AABQpbi	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Doesn't it strike you as odd that God is becoming less and less present?	Back in the Egyptian times, God virtually flunked himself in front of the masses: blowing up cities, making the sky rain fire, turning rivers into blood, killing first borns...      Then he got a little more humble around Jesus' time: turning water into wine (that was great, but doesn't beat a bloody river), curing one person here and there... No big shots that time.      And after that, we got nothing... just a few guest appearances on top of a hill witnessed by 2-3 kids once every 300 years.      Doesn't it strike you as odd that the more educated the masses are, the less likely miracles or strange things tend to happen?      How come these days, you have to rely 100% on faith and not expect God to flood your enemies or miraculously put out a fire? (or stop the ice caps from melting? That would save millions of lives!)      When did God become so cheap on his special effects?      Why doesn't he turn the glass of water in my hand into wine? That would be really impressive and people would believe me... because I don't even drink!

20090307145621AAMLFFv	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Are you just a reader or a does?	There are people who "read" science, and there are people who do    science==the people who "read" science perhaps don't question it. The people who actually do the science question everything--every bit of information that is published==a scientist would love nothing more than to prove other scientists wrong. It's an adversarial system among other things. Basic evolution has survived this adversarial environment for a century and a half without being falsified. Chemistry, biochemistry, paleontology, biology, genetics==all seem to agree with it. The bible hypothesis--well if we look at that with the same eye--we find a book that supposedly we should take literally. There is 0 evidence to support for example a world wide flood it talks about--none. In fact the story looks to be plagarized froom the sumerian epic of gilgamesh which is about a thousand years older than the noah story. We find much of the bible like this--moses coming from the king sargon sumerian myth for example--moses having no historical verification--nor verifiaction of the ten plagues, exodous, or even of the hebrews being in bondage in egypt. If we apply the same ruler to your bible as you require for evolution--then the bible certianly has been falsified--and as so cannot be considered a divine writing--it is in fact fictional--much like harry potter

This clearly goes against what the Bible teaches, so why are they angry if this fact gets pointed out?   Why say you believe in something if you don't practice it?

20090307150759AAa52i7	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Islam and embryology - how was this known 1430 years ago and Aristotle didnt know?	As i research islam more and more from its core text, i am amazed to know that this BOOK of islam was written 1430 years ago before MODERN science.   I just do not understand how this info was known 1430 years ago by Mohammed as these discoveries are recent      (Surat al-Muminun, 12-14)   We created man from the purest kind of clay; then made him a drop in a secure receptacle; then formed the drop into a clot and formed the clot into a lump and formed the lump into bones and clothed the bones in flesh; and then brought him into being as another creature. Blessed be Allah, the Best of Creators!       The above verses about the creation of human beings contain fundamental information from the field of embryology. The description of the womb as ‘a secure receptacle” indicates an important feature that has been better understood through modern science.   This text shows that a human embryo does not come all of a sudden without due development, as was believed since Aristotle until the 19th century. The text also stresses the fact that a human embryo goes through various stages of development, something that applies to all people of all races and generations.   I find it amazing that a book revealed 1430 years ago, can contain info like this which is only a recent discovery (19th Century).   I find this book more believable than the bible and torah as it ties in with science and was unimaginable at the time when it was revealed.   How did Mohammed know about embryology?

20090307141117AAbpkR9	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How come we all were ruined by Adam?	In school, each as an individual starts off with an A (100), and we either maintain that grade or it drops.  Each individual is given freedom until one disobeys, then that one is punished as one and not the the entire class.        Same within society. If someone breaks the law, only the one that disobeyed is punished, not society as a whole.      Then, how come God punished us as a whole? Why don't we all as individuals start off with an A or 100? Does he not have enough "time" to give us all the chance that Adam and Eve got?  We start of with 0 and have to prove and work ourselves to 100 while Adam started with 100 and worked his way down and I guess you could say back up to passing.      Shouldn't we start off as Adam did, it only seems just?

20090307135909AAxoWCg	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Does this sound MODEST or general sounding???? (OPEN LINK!) Thanks "?"?	I want to post it online - Titled - My Semi Professional Life -   If it weren’t for the cut off mark of one page, and my pocket full of white lies, my work resume would be littered with typical full time entry level occupations. At various times I've managed over 50 personnel along with billing and scheduling as a  secretary for a local security company; Cooked & Cleaned House for the elderly, been a waitress, a Subway sandwich artist, a Rite Aid cashier attendant, A Tulare County pre-foreclosure agent, Assisted a private investor in putting together a Huge Workshop Seminar for Real Estate, Worked as an independent negotiator for a Real Estate Brokerage getting commissions off of houses that I brought to him, working retail at the mall as a sales clerk (my sales topped the managers), then finally jumped on the bandwagon with Daniel when real estate was through the roof. I never in my life, believed I would work in this field of employment. I was never taught a thing about real estate by anyone, until I proved that I could help benefit someone financially as an intern or partner. After all, I was just another young girl. One who wasn’t outspoken or sought to be in the spotlight. I read up on plenty of books related to the subject, and felt confident enough to make my first negotiated contract. I remember how nervous I was, made the deal, and the rest is history. I realized around the year of 2006 how Lazy local Realtors were. I realized that there were a lot of potential deals to be made because if the Realtors weren’t making deals with out of state people (trying to get listings) who was? Apparently no one. My first independent job was working with Daniel, buying crappy pieces of land, from the out of state owners, and reselling to local California folks, at higher prices. Back then people were lending their money everywhere so that’s where we got our start up money. It was a good way to get into the business because we were putting extremely low amounts of money up, and getting a fair share back. Of course those days are over, however Daniel and I have still continued to find more and more areas of interest that other people just don’t seem to follow up on. As a team, we work out very well, because we both excel in different areas that the other person may not be good at. Its nice to have started from scratch together. That way, in time, we can go back and look at all the business & financial struggles we’ve come across together as a young couple.

20090307152233AAMGDfN	Society & Culture;Etiquette	How can I be more of a jerk?	I have always had a problem with being more assertive with people and letting them take advantage of me. Lately this one person in particular has been bugging the crap out of me and my family. She is the daughter of the people we rent from and so it makes it difficult to be rude and still feel safe about where we live. She comes over whenever she wants and if we're not home she lets herself in. She thinks she has the right to do so because her parents own the house and have some of their stuff stored here. She has recently volunteered my services as a seamstress to the lady next door so she obviously has had time to tell all the neighbors my business. I can't afford to move right now and am dealing with so many problems in life that having her around makes it even more of a burden. How can I be more of a jerk and quit caring about peoples feelings who obviously don't care about mine?

20090307145704AAcJjAv	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	From a Christian point of view, why do some people suffer more than others?	I know we live in a "fallen world" due to sin, etc., but I still have a hard time understanding why people don't equally suffer.  Many Christians say sin is sin and it's all the same, but no matter what...I still have a hard time seeing stealing a piece of candy in the same way as murder.  Also, I noticed a pattern that many happy-go-lucky Christian leaders seem to be people who've been brought up in  "healthy" way...not so much that they were rich, but that they've come from a basically functional family and were never abused as Children.  Maybe I'm wrong because not everyone talks about what they've been through, but based on the people I've met, it pretty much seems that way.  But if I'm pretty much right, it doesn't sound fair to me.  That means that they didn't face the same challenges as other people to feel the sadness and anger as those who've suffered more.      Please note:  This isn't so much about me.  Well, in a way it is because I'm having a hard day coping with a family member who is an alcoholic.  But, when I'm not looking at my own problems, I have a hard time reading news stories about babies who suffer and are mistreated, people in general who suffer, etc.   Among all the news I've been listening to lately, nothing has made me feel worse than the story about the woman who was mauled by the Chimpanzee.  And, it's not just a story....it's a REAL, TRAGIC situation.

20090307141054AAL1xv6	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Religious issues with my mother and son?	My mother is a Christian, sort of new to it, and has been botherinig me for awhile to allow my son to go to a Children's Group at her church. After a bit of a fight, she let me go along to the Saturday meeting, and I sat in on the class and said nothing, while she was the group aide or teacher's aide or whatever.      Afterwards, we went to IHOP and had breakfast, and she started talking about the lesson and Jesus and asking him what he thought about the truth.       My son is five, and he's rather unwaveringly honest, as kids tend to be, and told her that he thought that Jesus was a copycat, and he thinks that her concept of Hell is "mean."       This upset her very much, I think she was expecting the children's lesson on Jesus and what the coming Easter meant to make him Christian. She railed at me and said that he'd be better off with his (rapist) father than with me, and that I was being a bad parent by letting him learn about various religions, rather than raising him Christian.      I reminded her that she's the only Christian one in our family, and she had been an atheist for most of her life, and then we left because she was greatly upsetting him, and now he says he doesn't want to see Grandma anymore because her god made her mean (he remembers when she was an atheist) and she doesn't love us anymore.      I've tried to explain that Grandma thinks that we're going to a bad place and trying to save him, but he's now convinced that she hates us.       My wife has been trying to calm him down ever since, and I called my mother to see if we could fix it somehow but she won't pick up, and I don't know what to do.      My wife took him out for a walk and to see the horses, but I'm stuck on what to do. I do want my mother to be a part of my child's life, but she crossed a lot of lines, and I don't know if it's fixable.

20090307145139AA20Nqo	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Catholics: What do you think the Priest meant during this homily?	Last Mass, the second Sunday in Lent (March 1st)-      I'm sure that you are all aware of Obama's slogan: "Change we can believe in" (trust me, it relates)      In short, the Priest talked about the Lenten Season and prayer, fasting and almsgiving. He talked about how we are tempted by our indulgences of the things we love and chose to give up, and to strengthen our relationship between ourselves and Christ and to have faith.      At the end of the homily, the priest said these lines:   'Believe, so we can change'      Of course relating to Obama's slogan..      Anyways, what do you think the Priest meant?

20090307141647AA89cBC	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is it truly Monotheism?	I actually have a question that I've been thinking about for a while and finally decided to ask about.   In Christianity, Jesus is said to be the "Son of God,"  yet it is also claimed that God is only one and has no equal. If that is the case, then how is Jesus the Son of God or as some say "God" or "Lord?" Would that not make him God's equal? Would that not make Christians Ditheists instead of Monotheists? If Jesus is the Son of God, then wouldn't that detract from God's omnipotence and make him not so Almighty?      Please keep your answers fairly intelligent. This is a serious question and is not meant to poke fun at anyone.

20090307141232AAkcNVg	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why should a creator think like we do?	The bible, and most other religious myths describe a god that, apart from all the magic powers is basically....      A human being.       Might the god theory be down to the human tendency for projecting our own ideas  and emotions onto everything we see?      Lots of religions think  events like solar eclipses, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions etc. occur because they have somehow angered the gods.       See what I mean, we apply a totally human perspective onto a completely natural process. When something bad happens, with think emotion must have been involved, because that is how things work in our own little lives.      Oh, and there is another thing about humans...  we don't want to grow up.    We want to feel like someone is looking after us, and cares about what we do.    We want to feel important.    We want to feel loved.      The trouble is science has showed us that the reality, is nothing like that. Nature doesn't care what we do, because nature doesn't 'think' at all. It just cold-heartedly carries out the inevitable like a mathematical equation. Outside of our own little solar system, human influence is precisely zero. We're about as important as a speck of dust in an ocean.         We do have a choice of cause. We can keep believing in our imaginary friend to make us feel better about ourselves.      ....or we can grow up, and do something useful.

After I'm done with grad school I'll probably marry my boyfriend, who isn't a Christian, but I am.  I want to hear from the experiences of people who are in a "mixed marriage" and particularly how you dealt with a hostile church and/or Christian friends if you experienced this.  I'm not looking for people to quote the "do not be unequally yoked"; or for every random Christian to spout their opinion about it.  I am specifically asking for people in a marriage with someone who isn't a Christian.  I've got friends who have already hashed over everything you could tell me, so I don't need to hear it from random strangers.  I've come here, because even though all my Christian friends say I would have a horrible marriage, none of them seem to actually know anyone who is married to a non-Christian.  Anyway, any comments from the targeted group would be appreciated, and comments outside of that group will be met with open hostility.  Thanks for respecting me.

I'd like to preface this I've done a few searches on various topics, and all of the discussions that involve immigrants that have come to America (not usually Mexicans/South/Central Americans, that's another story, more eastern european, Indian/Russian area immigrants), seem to have a resentment toward America/Americans.  They refer to us as lazy, fat, stupid, and so on.  Hate our outlooks on the world, hate that we only care to learn one language on average, think we don't care about the rest of the world.      The easiest way to combat their negativity is to ask them why they're here, but that is obvious...$$$$$$$$$.  Which speaks volumes about their character in the first place.  They sacrifice their own morals for financial gain.      I guess my real question is:  Is it envy, or justified hatred?  America has contributed so much, if not the majority of the things we use in the world daily.  How could we possibly be vilified?      Cell Phones, computers, the airplane, air conditioning, refreigeration,  email, THE INTERNET, and countless medical advances over the years that have saved millions of lives around the world.  I don't understand how we are the bad guys, always.  WWII anyone?  You're Welcome.

20090307145301AARPe1i	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	What is the most frightening experiencee you've ever had?	I had just moved into an old house about 3 months ago. It was an old gorgeous Victorian house. But it was true as my mother told me. Over 51 years ago a young girl around the age of 12 killed herself over a unknown mental disease. My mother told me that the family believed the girl was possessed. After that the first night I slept there I found that in my dream There was a young girl. Very beautiful. blond and odd blue eyes she was in my room. But my bed looked different. It was a old bed. The girl was holding a knife and her face was dead and cold. There then was a whisper. A whisper so terrible and cold that it overcome my body with thoughts to awful to describe. She then began repeatedly stabbing herself. I awoke and screamed for the dream being  so real. The next day I told my mom about the dream. She told me it was nightmare and nothing more. When me and my mom were dusting the house the next day I found  small doll under my bed. The doll had a gorgeous chipped painted face. It looked much like the girl in the dream. Then I had realized... Bits of red worn paint like blood and under the bed was more large red stains that smelt so awfully. And a piece of torn paper. When looked at closely resembled the face of a demon. A hideous monstrous face. I threw this away. And The next dream I had was the doll sitting on our couch holding a blade and slowly turning into the girl and large amounts of blood coming from my parents room. As when I walked in sitting on there bed were two monsters. I can't even talk about what they looked like. They plunged for me and awoke sweating and crying. My mom and dad and little sister at my bed side. My mom holding a blade and a doll. She said this is what probably gave me nightmares. The next day I had took evryrthing I found and dumped it in the river. I to this day still have these dreams getting worse and worse each time. I even see faces sometimes...

Me and my bestfriend met two guys at a club last weekend (they are first cousins). they seemed realllly decent.    A week passed, and during that week we spoke to the guys a few times... the guy i was interested in (Leo) asked me to catch up this weekend straight away and when i spoke to him during the week briefly he sounded really keen. the only time me and my friend could do was saturday night.    He told me he would call me saturday morning/afternoon to finalise our plans. He didnt. i sent a msg (around 1) asking if meeting up around 6.30 -7 would be ok for them. I didnt get a reply.   Meanwhile, the guy my friend was interested in (Zac) called her during the day and implied that the 'catch up' was still on. He said that he hadnt heard from Leo though, and that he would get in touch with us when he did.    We travelled into the city and waited. She called Zac a few times during the night and he said he hadnt even heard from Leo and made up a few excuses (Leo had to work until 8, he had soccer). As the night wore on Zac got more and more angry (according to my friend). He never initiated calls to fill us in on what was happening though.   I dont know what to believe and what to do now? nothing was finalised and feel so stupid :(

On Sunday I finally worked up the courage to tell my friend I am bi, she didnt really take it too well, she had not been in contact with me since then (we usually call/text every day) until I saw her today at work. I told her because I was getting sick of her always saying derogatory things about gay/bi people, I asked her "would you suddenly hate me if I was gay/bi" she said yes so I told her I was bi, today she was kind of off with me and when we were chatting about tattoos I asked her about a design and if she would get it and she said "no only dykes get that", I said to her that when she says these things it upsets me and all she says is its the way she is.      We really got on well until she started saying these derogatory things (at one point I even had feelings for her more than a friend), now I feel bad about myself and feel depressed because I am losing one of my good friends, she doesnt want to admit I am bi though as when I told her I didnt like her using terms like dyke etc she said "why?" and I said you know why and she said "what?" so I didnt go into it again.      The really weird thing is other people say that they think she likes me (in that way) as she is always staring at me, looking deep in my eyes, laughing at everything I say, playfully teasing me etc, what should I do? I feel rubbish now that she doesnt like me as a friend. And what makes her dislike gay/bi people so much (she isnt relegious so thats not the reason why)?

I was thinking about mabey becoming one, but I need to get the facts straight first. I'm kinda young (Kinda young teenager) and I want to know. I dont want to just stick to one religion, I want to branch out and try new things before I am dead set on somthing.    Thanks!   ~Megan

I was floating in space and moving toward the sun as a loving energy called me toward it. It was the best feeling I've ever experienced. I'm hoping that someone else has had the same dream.
20090307155209AAeaxzr	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Southern vs Northern Manners?	So, here's the dealio.  My girlfriend is from New Hampshire, and I'm from the mid-west, and everyone's commented on her apparent rudeness and withdrawnness.  She doesn't make eye-contact, she'll walk away from someone when they're talking, and is very reserved and won't say much.  Is this a cultural thing?  I mean, I know what everyone's said about southerners having better manners, but I never really noticed it or understood it.  Are people from New Hampshire just rude compared to people in the mid-west, or is this something unique to her?

20090307155515AAtE0Qs	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Adventist Veiw on Heaven/Hell?	I've been a Seventh-Day Adventist my whole life. I've learned a lot through the years about our views on food/diet and day of worship and other topics. But I've never truly understood the views of what will happen at the end of time. Not exactly what will happen. But, what exactly do you have to do  to get the ticket to eternal life? I know that one must accept Jesus as his personal Savior and they have to do the whole forgiveness, new birth thing, but, do you have to be Seventh-day Adventist? Can you just be a good Christian if you don't believe in the "Seventh-day"?
20090307155835AARbMlX	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Freemason story of Lucifer?	Someone a couple of years ago, who claimed he was a freemason, told me his story of Lucifer falling from heaven.  It was something about god making a mistake, and Lucifer wanting humans to know about it, so god cast him out, and on his fall, Lucifer told us that he loved us.  And God created hell to warp his mind, and the minds of everyone else who thought god was imperfect....   It was something to that extent.  He told it long, and beautifully.  I can't seem to find the story anywhere, and I'd really like to hear it again.  Does anyone know it, or where I could find it.  I doubt it's even a freemason story.  The person who told it to me was pretty crazy.      And please, no religion lectures.   I'm not saying I believe the story, just thought it was fascinating.      Thanks!
