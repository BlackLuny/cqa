XNaEyYqtaa	yes.|`|zdGpaFlfaa	no|`|mQgoqrC9aa	Not even close. And who is that hairy thing he's holding?|`|N7UCCGDDaa	i can definitely see the resemblance. but your friend is really cute, so comparing him to eddie munster doesn't really do him justice. but i definitely see where you're coming from. but your friend is definitely a lot cuter|`|FgsRcuDpaa	Not really..|`|S0XArokKaa	No.|`|vWKQJhwRaa	i think so... :D|`|y5fqvBvUaa	not really.....somewhat|`|XsqQHKk0aa	Not really|`|B83DTe78aa	your name is the answer - it's just you.
AA11946996	Sounds about right, for us anyways. I'm a Gemini/Cancer and full of contradictions. I'm full of it, really, full of feelings and thoughts.  Sometimes I'm shy but mostly I'm not. I didn't know that there were more out there, cool, I guess that makes you my sister.|`|1PdUecpYaa	my bestfriend used to be shy in high school. she's a gemini with virgo moon. and now she's outgoing like a typical gemini. she said it takes time for her to get out of her shell.. but she did.|`|6RMzUa4Saa	yea...wow ive been wondering the same thing lately..im a gemini cancer moon 2 and i am shy until i get to know sumone..then u cant shut me up!!lol...mabey its just a gemini/cancer thing...|`|ZyXpGLl4aa	Lots of shy/ quieter Gemini's.
IXWMIOPiaa	I think that she couldnt get any stupider! And i think it is our business because she is an idol for many young girls and so is chris brown to a lot of young boys and they are both setting a terrible example. Being a celebrity brings with it responsability- thats my opinion anyway.<br>  I really liked rihanna before she took him back and felt sorry for her when i heard he had attacked her, now if he hits her again then i have no sympathy as shes basically telling him its fine to do that.<br>  Women like that annoy me.|`|B2w5MwjXaa	of course it's dumb, any person with any common sence can answer that, but as most girls know, emotions get the best of us. and no one wants to be alone.  i wont lie, if i was in her shoes i would probably have done the same thing, but that doesnt make it the right thing to have done.|`|7jSnPSQJaa	NO because nobody actually knows what happened between chris brown and Rihanna. When we find out exactly what happen then we can determine if Rihanna is dumb. NOBODY knows what happened officially accept Chris Brown And Rihanna.|`|Io7x29vhaa	yes she is &+ he's mine <3|`|y5fqvBvUaa	no cuz who else would date them if they broke up|`|ndXvMLZ2aa	Well, I think it so. He practically beat her up and she forgives him and they get back together again. I know I wouldn't! But I agree with A. It's not really our business what goes on between Chris Brown and Rihanna.|`|AA12382198	I think it's crazy.....but this is what happens when to a lot of women who are in abusive relationships.<br>  <br>  Before this happened she would've told a girl friend in the same situation to leave.......but for some women when it happens to them they believe they will be different.<br>  <br>  It's sad.|`|qSwaXLBeaa	To be honest, I don't think it's any of our business and I don't think we have the right to have an opinion as it's got nothing at all to do with us.|`|zFQi5U5Naa	yes she is dumb as a bag of hammers if he hit her once he can do it again I dont feel sorry for her she is sinking her own boat|`|f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	Yep, I think anyone who goes back to abuse is digging their own grave.
0ffdb9dc23ea4daa66d018dcdabc0a14aa	Here lately I have noticed the same thing. It has gotten really dark and weird the last few episodes. New writers I guess.|`|zBC6n34Naa	We're currently in the 2nd half of Season 4 - Galactica (re imagined) has always been "dark" and "strange."  The human race has been all but annihilated by it's own creations!?  Unicorns and rainbows?!  I think not.<br>  <br>  If it's any consolation, the final two episodes are titled "Daybreak."  <br>  <br>  In summary... it's always darkest before the light.  <br>  <br>  Grammar police:  "Most of it don't make any sense..."  - doesn't - doesn't make any sense.|`|cMsC5a14aa	I like it heck after they found Earth what to do now?? Cant wait to find out|`|IMPh53Ssaa	I know same thing with Sarah Conner Chronicles, Guess they got new writers|`|QXQWDw1qaa	I haven't cared all that much for the recent version of Battle Star Galactica... I prefered the original... but I STILL record the show every week and I have a COMPLETE SET of ALL the GATTLE STAR GALACTICA EPISODES.. and that includes the FIRST ONES.
BKybwvF5aa	I love them both! I've been a fan of Batman way before the Spider-man movies came out, but I love them both! The new Batman movies are the best though. They've actually made them more realistic and they're really great! Batman and Spider-man rule!|`|r9lfDeRmaa	Personally I like the Batman movies more even Begins they just seem more real, the Spiderman movies are just to comical (they're good they're just not my cup of tea)<br>  <br>  I think everyone went to see The Dark Knight after they saw Begins because it was underrated, and Ledgers portrayal of the Joker was the best acting I have seen in 10 years.|`|nxRP9NIlaa	Batman bores me. <br>  i like the joker and hate the green goblin<br>  but i like spiderman outta the 2 :]|`|AA10744842	your wrong ,hun i think batman comes up top in his movies.|`|ftYnOMzEaa	Spider Man<br>  <br>  I honestly didn't like The Dark Knight all that much.|`|c661ffb50a295d702392241cf59b4170aa	I am a huge Batman fan. I liked him when he was played by Michael Keaton and I LOVE him played by Christian Bale.<br>  <br>  I never paid much attention to SpiderMan but I can say that he would have been MUCH improved if he was played by someone other than Tobey Maguire. I understand he's "relatable" and all but I just don't think Maguire is that good of an actor. And the entire franchise hasn't really been casting great actors/actresses. Let me rephrase...it has but the writing has been awful.<br>  <br>  I loved Batman Begins and I loved The Dark Knight. Yes, the Joker was a huge draw but like I said Batman Begins was awesome in it's own right...mainly because of Bale.|`|O2cRo5ipaa	Batman is the ****!<br>  alot of people went to see Batman Begins, and sure  Heath Ledger did drum up some excitement for The Dark Knight, but it wasn't just because he died, it was because the Joker was an iconic character. Heath's portryal did it justice.<br>  <br>  Spiderman has been DRAGGED on, from the first movie it was all downhill, poor scripts and badly acted scenes.<br>  very poor.<br>  <br>  bring on the next batman film, and R.I.P  heath <3|`|a7wao0lGaa	Spider Man has been my favorite hero since I was a kid. The first 2 spider man movies were awesome, but the last one was just horrible. It killed the whole series. The villains are ok.<br>  <br>  The Batman movies have been very good so far. In my opinion, they have been better than the spider man movies. And the villains are awsome. Of course, we still have to wait for the third movie. But so far, batman has been better.|`|HyUE9ON0aa	I agree with you, Batman's villains in the TV series, movies, cartoons for some reason always comeback while Spiderman has a new enemy everytime.<br>  <br>  <br>  You have to admit though, the batman villains are cool.

f02fdd44028e78a86a13cf15a8da31e7aa	I have a problem with motion sickness and have to be VERY choosy in which rides I go on. <br>  I go on the Pirate Ship all the time and I have never been sick. It's just fun. I also like the Ferris Wheel, Gondola, I believe it's called the Escalator?, and other rides similar to these. <br>  I don't like big roller coasters but will go on the smaller ones. <br>  If you've been on the Space Mountain roller coaster then the Pirate Ship will be a breeze for you.<br>  HAVE FUN!!!!|`|381ba6jRaa	I you're not too sure about the ride sit in the middle of the row in the middle of the boat.|`|q8Tkh1zdaa	I would sit in the middle because towards the ends of the boat is where you feel most of the motion|`|v8lSuNQzaa	Once i was on one while i had a migraine and vomited. LOL Sit in the middle for less motion.|`|VJqDtuoPaa	LOL good luck. Its a tummy turner. Dont eat before you get on. If you like that weightless feeling like you are falling sit on either end you will love it. LOL if not sit in the middle and...sorry 4 ya!|`|abx5VNsOaa	In the middle for 1st time,you'll feel less like you will fall out.<br>  I took my mum  when she was in her late 50's on that,we were only 2 on ride,she was cool,i screamed.|`|DbIL3BItaa	The first time I went on one of them, i was right at the top and I was terrified, and vowed never to go on one ever again. But I should point out that I am the world's biggest coward when it comes to rollercoasters XD
wZa3qiSbaa	Aquarius + Libra<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Air + Air = Wind<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Libra is a natural diplomat … and you're a harmless revolutionary, some might say. This blend of energies is wild, but also quite compatible. Libra will absolutely love your zany antics.<br>  <br>  There's a natural romantic connection between you. You’re quite likely to hit it off immediately, and to know that there’s something pretty special going on between you. You are both governed by the air element, which is a plus: you have similar attitudes to most things.<br>  <br>  You could develop some unusual ideologies together. Even leaving aside any social or political ideas, there’ll be plenty of magical moments when you bring your minds together in extended discussions. Current affairs will be a hit topic. And social mixing, which is high on the agenda for both of you, will have to be with people that aren't your normal, run-of-the-mill types.<br>  <br>  Both of you have progressive views about love and marriage, but Libra is probably coy rather than seriously committed to non-commitment, which is what you are. Some Aquarians still subscribe to the hippie concept of free love: freedom in their most intimate relationships. You are both committed to exploring this aspect of your relationship.<br>  <br>  Libra’s explorations may go as far as indulging in some harmless flirtations, but they will fall a long way short of your out there approach, which you’ll want to push to the limits. You want to investigate all the possibilities of freedom in intimacy.<br>  <br>  Perhaps the two of you need to treat this relationship as a casual arrangement for a while before you commit to a serious affair. Once you’ve satisfied your individual needs to explore and experiment with the whole free love idea, you’ll have a much better chance as a couple. With that out of the way, a more traditional commitment will be feasible.<br>  <br>  If you unite with Librans born between 23 September and 3 October, there’s no doubt that transformation, for the better, will take place. These people will inspire you to do your best and become someone important. They feel inspired in the same way by your support for them.<br>  <br>  Librans born between 4 October and 13 October will instantly recognise you as a soulmate, and you'll feel exactly the same. Essentially, you’ll feel connected on all levels. This combination can create a wonderful relationship for the two of you.<br>  <br>  Long-term involvement with Librans born between 14 October and 23 October will be a confusing affair for you. With this combination, although you enjoy each other’s company and you love doing things together, you may never quite settle down into the groove of committed love.|`|6HyFHrfIaa	Yes you are. Be careful because of the age difference. Moving on though, with both of you being Air sign personalities, you are critical but considered puzzle solvers. It's weird because both Libra and Aquarius are attracted to each other yet Libra is more sociable and Aquarius likes the felling of relaxation. Both of you may come off as unemotional or affections of display that are not very sensuous....at first anyway.|`|F51bF3nvaa	why not,<br>  i am a libra girl ,just like going out,having fun ,a air sign and aquarius the same<br>  you should try|`|IqqaA2wIaa	yes it could be good....but in the same town has a chance....long distance wont work...good luck|`|PCAlAoDsaa	Yes you are. Libra and Aquarius are very compatible for each other. I would try it for a couple of months and see how it goes.

L6jKwlyXaa	RaggaSex by Ottomix, maybe?<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DLgITahoog" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DLgITaho...</a><br>  <br>  Edit I have added your question to my watchlist, let me look around to see if i find it.
wZa3qiSbaa	Scorpio + Aries<br>  <br>  Water + Fire = Steam<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Power is the name of the game when a Scorpio and Aries combine forces. How you use this power will determine how much happiness you have together. In some cases a battle of wills is likely, as Aries have just as much fire and purposefulness as you.<br>  <br>  And of course when your elements are blended, you have a very steamy affair. In fact, this can be quite a sizzling relationship once it gets going. You will immediately be attracted to the passionate and sexual side of each other.<br>  <br>  Scorpio will excite hot-headed Aries, and they will boost your desire to explore new possibilities. You’re both strong-willed individuals with unique personalities, so compromise will be important if you are to make a go of it together.<br>  <br>  It seems that sexuality will dominate this relationship. Mars, which rules you, controls the Aries character as well. You have so much in common. However, Aries will find it hard to negotiate and come to an understanding with you, particularly in home life and domestic affairs.<br>  <br>  They’ll want the house to be a centre of excitement and partying, and the destination for an endless stream of visitors. You, on the other hand, being a very secretive and private person, will want your home to be a sanctuary or haven rather than Grand Central Station. This will create conflicts.<br>  <br>  You will be at loggerheads over life perspectives too, because you are both very determined and forceful in your views. You’ll clash intensely. These bouts of rage, when you both try to prove your superiority over the other, will, however, be nicely relieved by kiss and make up sessions. You could well find yourselves infuriating each other just to get to that exciting bedroom aftermath!<br>  <br>  You’ll have a fiery and dynamic combination with Aries born between 21 March and 30 March. They will not take to any of your emotional control games. If you can give them the space they need, your great sexual relationship will more than make up for these other issues.<br>  <br>  Those born between 31 March and 10 April might try to dominate you, especially in work and other professional activities, which will seriously annoy you. This could be a disastrous combo if you don’t like submitting yourself to someone else — and most Scorpios don’t.<br>  <br>  Aries born between 11 April and 19 April are probably best suited to you, because they have Jupiter and Sagittarius strongly co-ruling them. You have very strong emotional and karmic connections with Aries born during this period.|`|TJrRPIFLaa	I'm a Scorpio and my husband is an Aries.  For us it definitely works.  Our chemistry is amazing, and the sex is the best I've ever had.  I admire his ambition and strong will, and he likes my mysteriousness, creativity and passion.|`|pauzBlpgaa	i would say don't pay attention to that stuff. anyone can make it work with anyone, it doesn't matter when you were born.|`|ogRTCBt1aa	i dnt rlly pay attention 2 tht stuff|`|n53BNB8taa	Hi<br>  scorpio and aries good match but try to control your anger (both of you)but don't try to control each other.|`|82niQjyCaa	a starsign is not the same as a person. its just a prediction therefore they are probably not true, just forget about it you will know if your right for each other.

M5HHf6FWaa	yep, I think so.|`|JotdiI3zaa	I am a big supporter of guns and the second amendment. Chris Rock was right about gun control. There shouldn’t be any. There should be bullet control. Price bullets starting at $5,000 a piece, then if someone shoots someone else, you know they deserved it. Especially if the victim has about $50,000 worth of bullets in him. According to Wikipedia T.I.’s felon status stemmed from selling cocaine, ecstasy, marijuana, and while selling drugs he was in possession of guns. In addition, he has numerous probation violations, again selling drugs while in possession of guns. This current bust only included guns, which violate his felony probations again. If Nicole Richie can get an hour behind bars, T.I. is gonna get the book thrown at him, a big thick book, like a dictionary or something really big, and thick. Then after an hour or two they’ll shake the long finger of the law at him again, and tell him he better be good this time.|`|mHlLVsSvaa	Why would he go to jail?

1cfMOZ36aa	its obvious sakura loves naruto, and sakura truly believes naruto is the strongest shinobi in konoha she trusts him completely. and there relationship has blossomed into best friends. they have basically grown up together in a sense. however its not decided yet if sakura loves him like a boy friend...<br>  <br>  <br>  it has been obvious from the begining hinata loves naruto like a boyfriend. i really like both hinata and sakura, but i think sakura would make a happier ending..<br>  <br>  but if naruto got together with hinata they.d have a helluva strong child.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	Well since hinata is not dead, but obviously the kiddy fans can't see that. Naruto will keep fighting Pein, but then he will find Hinata ALIVE. Sakura does not like Naruto that way, geez get over it.<br>  <br>  Edit- Kiddy fan buhahahaha wrong. IM not narusaku nor naruhina.<br>  <br>  Edit- Im not a kiddy fan, and i really could care less about pairings in an anime that is not based around romance. What i hate is people going around spreading rumors when they have no clue if it actually happened. Ergo the kiddy fans.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit- Kishi has but one pairing in this anime, what makes you think he will add more to an ACTION anime, not a romance anime.|`|u5eHNj0taa	both that'll be cool. but he's gonna kick some @$$|`|HhpRxYSLaa	LOL, all the NaruHina fans are saying "WHEN HE FINDS OUT HER FEELINGS HE'S GOING TO START LIKING HER!!!"<br>  <br>  Um...no. Even if Hinata is alive, he won't just start liking her like that. He's human. I hope he still ends with up Sakura, because unlike NaruHina, it's actually had development, and it makes sense.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Hey, kiddy fan below me, in case you can't read the asker said "NARUSAKU fans only", you're in the wrong question.<br>  <br>  REEDIT: Kiddy fan, it doesn't make you a NaruSaku fan even if you aren't a NaruHina fan, so you're still in the wrong question, loollll.<br>  <br>  REREEDIT: This is about proof of the possibility of couples in naruto. It IS A shonen manga but that doesn't mean pairings are out of question. And quite frankly, Naruto has a better chance with Sakura than Hinata, and I am not even a hardcore NaruSaku shipper.
slKPLRLaaa	Well its a question of taste.<br>  <br>  I too find anime stupid such as dragon ballz and pokemon crap.<br>  <br>  <br>  Yet the fans see something we don't and vice versa.|`|hzH75VDXaa	What have you been watching?<br>  <br>  Sure there are many gorey anime, but there are also many gorey movies. Some people enjoy the gore, but not every anime has that.<br>  <br>  As for cat ears, once again not every anime has people with cat ears. Most don't  Every anime has people with cat ears is something I hear quite often and I wonder where people get this idea from since the most popular anime like Naruto and Bleach don't have this.<br>  <br>  As for  sex, well excluding Hentai there isn't much sex to be found in regular anime.<br>  <br>  If there is some, it's usually rated PG13 or R at most, like the kinds you see in television shows and movies. Two people  in bed together, it fades to black. they wake up the next morning.. that sort of thing.<br>  <br>  There are plenty of anime that is based in reality. No demons, monsters, giant robots, Death Gods, etc.<br>  <br>  It sounds to me that either you haven't seen enough anime, or you are just generalizing the way so many people tend to.|`|4bFypdGLaa	sounds like you have only seen hentai, sex anime, not all  anime. I for one have never watched it and still don't let it bother me anymore then any other porn... and why would anyone wanna see bad paid actors banging each other more than drawings... I find it both as pointless.<br>   <br>  And sound like the only other anime you've seen is Elfen Lied... the only anime that fits your description .. cat ears exploding heads so on... but not the sword thing though... and since when has no head exploded in any other Media?<br>  <br>  You clearly haven't seen any or many.<br>  <br>  As for huge eyes.. the simpsons have larger eyes than most anime characters.. I don't know where that Idea even came from.<br>  Homer: <a href="http://www.simpsoncrazy.com/gallery/images/HomerSimpson48.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.simpsoncrazy.com/gallery/imag...</a><br>  Anime character I googled at random: <a href="http://rubenerdshow.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/likecorm.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://rubenerdshow.com/blog/wp-content/...</a><br>  <br>  But to answer your question: I like aime because (keep in mind no anime is alike and I don't liek ALL anime just the once that are good) their original, the animation is good, it has good humor and there's alot of care put into the making them unlike disney is doing.. and no I don't hate american animation. I just think Disney channel is destroying youth. I have 2 baby sisters so I've seen what is does -_-''|`|u5eHNj0taa	its cool<br>  depends on which one you watch try out death note|`|dxqJTXfJaa	First off, anime isn't a cartoon (which is a common mistake). It's a form of animation. It just sounds like you were only exposed to  shonen (guy) anime and hentai (anime porn). Anime's very diverse. My first anime was Dragon Ball Z, when it first aired on Toonami. I was attracted to it because it was different. Then, my friend told me what anime was and I've seen a lot of them. Art styles vary from director to director and if you hate violence so much, why not try shojo (girl) anime. Shojo's mostly love stories, mostly high school romance. Or better yet, you could come on here and describe what show you're into. I can garentee they have an anime on it.<br>  <br>  One major differences between Anime and Cartoons is that (most) cartoon are childish and/or immature. Anime can be like that too, but has so much more to offer in terms of everything.|`|seJcARDdaa	"no offense 2 any1-i just dont care 4 it-i seen some and will never look at it again---<br>  except voltron"<br>  <br>  <br>  UM....<br>  If you can start making exceptions, don't you think there might be OTHERS.<br>  How can you put ALL anime into the same category?<br>  <br>  What you just described as "typical" anime is far from the truth and your idea of it does not at ALL represent most of the anime out there.<br>  <br>  <br>  Try other series before you generalize it all.<br>  There are genres and sub-genres that have absolutely nothing to do with what you say can be appropriated to ALL anime.|`|G9Ek1hS8aa	anime sexy<br>  <br>  i want to see kenny and yumichika get it out <br>  Ikkaku in a mad fit shops off yumichika's stuffed girl with kitty ears head<br>  he declares his dying love for yumichika <br>  kenny is all alone<br>  <br>  <br>  all i know is yumichika has bas taste in men<br>  <br>  badly is so ugh!<br>  <br>  i rather see him with tamaki<br>  <br>  yumichika and tamaki forever|`|a984cQjKaa	you watched the weird stuff.  the best stuff out there is just like movies and tv, only it's animated.  give it another try, watch something like cowboy bebop or deathnote.  it's not all hentai (anime porn).|`|u8WyN7cHaa	i used to be like you....<br>  <br>  till i saw<br>  <br>  <br>  DEATH NOTE!!!<br>  <br>  and i was like<br>  <br>  Jesus H Christ!

Mine however is much different.  Sure some of it is weird, and some of it is crap, but there is also a lot of good stuff.<br>  <br>  Just be you don't like it doesn't mean that everybody feels the same way.|`|6rR7LTl1aa	Congrats, Ron -- you've seen some gorey, moe-laden, and pink-themed anime.<br>  <br>  Be advised that this is barely a fraction of the genres covered by anime as a medium.<br>  <br>  Your analysis would be akin to me writing off all American movies as chock-full of violence, rape, and torture after seeing a mere five movies that happened to contain them.<br>  How does it feel to commit logical fallacy?<br>  <br>  EDIT: Kazura, while I could not agree more with the point you were making, I feel compelled to point out that a troll is, in general, either A) more flagrantly offensive, B) more competent, or C) both.  Ron here doesn't quite make the cut with either.<br>  EDIT2: Jack Dawson, you are correct to note that it is a matter of taste.  However, you appear to be committing the same error as the asker in dismissing the medium on account of a small handful of titles.|`|Hiasgb75aa	It would be best for everyone to not try and feed the troll
FONfnGLaaa	No. I think that people tend to treat better looking people better, but my life would not be better if I were more attractive because people would not be genuine by judging me by my appearance rather than my personality.|`|1d8f9804d5f64e940dfb5d7043f684edaa	nope, id still be  a broke lil bi***|`|l6Jew1qAaa	Personally, no. Not that I am attractive...I am not. My husband says I am, but I disagree. Whatever. I think that our society focuses way too much on physical beauty or the lack thereof; when people don't get jobs or get paid less or get looked down upon or don't get dates or get married or whatever host of ills may befall a person...because they are "unattractive" it shows a serious lack of depth in our society. Who defines what is attractive anyway? And why do we let them? I read a news piece the other day where some crazy designer said Heidi Klum is too fat...come on! Then there was the paparazzi that said the Jennifer Love Hewitt is fat...again, come on! How stupid is that. These women are beautiful, yet someone out there is trying to say they are less than they should be. Our society is becoming sick with these unreachable ideals of perfection and what it means to be attractive. We really should get a grip and just let people be who and how they want to be...just my 2 cents.|`|PNEqnhivaa	I think life would be better as in yyou would feel more confident within yourself however been more attractive does not make the life around you better because life has nothing to do with looks =]|`|AA11605648	yes .

There is no point in waisting time wishing you looked like someone else, because that is never going to happen. The best you can do in life is make the best of what you've got. and personality alters people's perception on your looks automatically-that's important too.|`|fc711dee0348a3fa4c47b0371bd359d5aa	I'm fine with the way I am.  I wish I didn't have to get older however.  On other people though, I find sexy preferable to good looks.  Sexy is something else.  It comes from the spirit.  It's a unique thing, you either have it or you don't.  Perfect aesthetics wont make a difference.  That style is just something that can't be bought.|`|556f6a84a1e72fa5f9fa440c37251fe4aa	Yes, it would.  People have given me crap all my life about being "ugly" and "looking like a goob".

xfguFkDtaa	Hostage (2005) with Bruce Willis. But part of your storyline doesn't quite fit.  You've got the latter half correct. There was a sister AND her younger brother. The first police officer to arrive on the scene was a female and she gets mortally wounded. Her shooter (the meanest and most disturbed of the three young men) does push one of the three guys over a railing to his death below. This same mean guy (played by Ben Foster) writes "BURN" on the one-way mirror in the security room of the house and then proceeds to set fire to the house. Bruce Willis, if I remember right, kills him before escaping with the two kids under a wet blanket or cloak of some sort.  Good movie! A little contrived.|`|BayNRRaVaa	definitely hostage, ben foster is the creepy guy. great movie-you should watch Alpha dog, he's great in it.|`|ad726a6da717706413a791538143fa6baa	Sounds like Hostage to me too|`|AA11081968	sounds like Fear to me with Marky mark and Reese Witherspoon|`|6IGph0K9aa	the movie is indeed "hostage"

So what?!!!|`|0hXKHyDzaa	i dont really think fake fans are people who like one song from a band or whatever.<br>  i can't stand when people listen to a certian kind of music or band or whatever to impress people. it's so annoying.|`|3LEPfzVhaa	It doesn't really bother me...Music is music, you don't own it.<br>  There are a lot of bands on my ipod that I probably only know a few songs from, but I guess I wouldn't call myself a fan, I'd just said I liked them..<br>  As the other person said, fans of Led Zeppelin...I've got Kashmir and thats it, so I wouldn't call myself a fan of them either, I just like them. <br>  I think a lot of people just want to look cool, so say they like bands.<br>  Theres a lot of kids in my school who wear the Rolling Stone logo...And don't even know any songs...<br>  I don't know any, so I wouldn't wear the logo...Simple as.|`|AA10714718	To indirectly quote Cobain, "music will become a tool for young people to socialize and fu**. It wont even be music, just a bunch of sounds." For the most part music has become a fashion statement, free downloads are offered when people buy other items. Music has become a service not an art. I havn't been around too long to know whether it has always been so commercial or not but it is today.|`|QTZd2vVAaa	I completely understand what you mean, Im the same with Fall Out Boy. It is completely fine to like only one song as long as you dont say youre a true fan. i hate it when people say there a true fan when the only know thnks fr th mmrs and dance, dance.|`|IvAJwpjgaa	i see A LOT of posers that "hate" Slipknot and torture themselves into "enjoying" Meshuggah`s "bits" cuz "it`s cool"...gawsh, that`s hilarious.|`|HjZcH6dGaa	reading this made me stupider.|`|dtfkHYpMaa	Stop being a music snob|`|AA11234058	Ok well I don't believe that there are fake fans but different levels of fans. 1st. there is the true die hard fan of the musical group, that follows their tours no matter wat or who else comes along. 2nd is the fan that likes wat they hear and say wow this is amazing, I want to hear more. 3rd is the fan that sees the band's name on a shirt and calls themself a fan. This, however, is the lowest of all the fans. These are the people who don't even appreciate the music but just where the logo.
l1yKSJTAaa	El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Jomer (The Mysterious Voyage of Homer)<br>  <br>  I found it by googling "Homer" "Chili" "Drunk" LOL.|`|uuPJ9xmNaa	It's the one with the chili cook off. It's called "El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Jomer." Season 8, Episode 9<br>  I love that episode!|`|SSeWnDPkaa	It was a chili pepper. Episode # 3F24. Hit the link...|`|AA12130640	I don't remember the name but I saw it the other day. Marge was keeping homer from the chili cook- off and he found out anyway. He though he was tough and tried to eat the worlds hottest pepper but he failed so he drinks candle wax and goes back and eats like 5 of them and outshines officer Wigghem. It was so hot that he started to trip (aka go crazy) and ends up in this fantasy land with a coyote as his spirit guide. Hes supposedly supposed to find his soul mate and he thinks Marge isn't it so he leaves and ends up at the light house. It was called "El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Jomer (The Mysterious Voyage of Homer)" and It was aired January 5, 1997 season 8 episode 162.|`|RplkclzJaa	El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Homer.....and its a chili cookoff|`|vXlrA4oMaa	I think it was called the mysterious voyage of our homer.

It's likely there is other life out there in the universe.<br>  <br>  UFO's = No, because I don't believe aliens have visited Earth<br>  <br>  Ghosts = No|`|svYiQZUHaa	Yes I do. Because I see demon's in so many people that pass me by on the street. I also hear things before people say them. Aliens yes I mean how do you explain all these theories of aliens and area 51 has proof.|`|cgjbw1jKaa	i saw a ufo ..well three actually all at the same time.my friend was with me and we both witnessed it. we werent on drugs either . they were moving really fast and irratically like nothing else ive known on earth.seriously!|`|AA10378030	yes, yes and yes. Always have and I always will. There is more out there than we know or even what we are told.|`|oC038fKcaa	Not aliens<br>  not ufo's<br>  but ghosts.|`|4I70V3FAaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Because youtube is too convincing.|`|iBH7NTl3aa	I work with aliens & a headless woman walks my landing at night moaning hun|`|2GDE5VqKaa	ghost<br>  because i do.<br>  why are you asking this question?|`|cdRDWS3baa	yes.<br>  <br>  well.... why not? we don't have much proof that they don't exist do we?|`|vBIwaQ0qaa	All of the above ; )|`|yqWlt0Q7aa	No|`|mHlLVsSvaa	Yep, because I can.|`|2B6F5Zhtaa	If you mean ghosts as in the sense of a soul left on the earth, possibly, but i don' believe we could see them.<br>  <br>  Aliens, i think it would be wrong to suggest the don't exist, because that would suggest that we are the only Intelligent beings in the universe, and i deem that improbable.|`|HQ4t7JfGaa	i belive in ghost since my granpa  told me this real story it was wonderful yet ******* nigtmares.   how it happen'd was he woke up to go to the bath and he saw this ghost in white goin fast in front of him and he didnt say nottin but went back to sleep lol and the next mornin they found out that the grave behind them was been repraid and theres another one on youtube real ghost videos SO SCARY  search ghost on youtube and then click on view count|`|eYzuxqQaaa	I guess. I want to, because I think that it would be really cool to truthfully be able to say that you either witnessed a ghost, a UFO, or an alien. That would make my day. :)|`|IMPh53Ssaa	aliens yes,  UFOs yes its just means its unidentified, ghosts no|`|YBQHAbOIaa	I believe we all desented from aliens & are just an experiment.|`|324q5sOLaa	Well we cant be the only life in the Galaxy so yes to the first bit and i have seen a ghost so yes to the second|`|2fnFVo2iaa	no way are you kidding me!|`|tJSmhyTxaa	no, because if i did it would freak me out!|`|1d8f9804d5f64e940dfb5d7043f684edaa	yes<br>  because, well why not?<br>  its better then believing in god or accepting jesus christ into my heart.|`|f7qVtYfaaa	i think there is life elsewhere,not humans per se and no, no aliens have visited and i don't believe there are ghosts. i like the idea of these things but let's be realistic.|`|IaK4SRHpaa	I don't really believe in ghosts because I've never seen one.  If I ever did then I would probably start to believe in them.<br>  <br>  As to Alien's and UFO's, I believe they could exist but only because it would seem highly unlikely that we would be the only intellegent beings in this whole universe of ours.  They may not look exactly like us or act like us but there must be other forms of life out there.<br>  <br>  What about you?|`|5fcM3HLsaa	Aliens: statistically they are highly probable. Have they visited the Earth? No. The problem is the extremely large distances between planets and stars, and the law that states that nothing can exceed the speed of light. <br>  <br>  Ghosts: absolutely not. Absurd.|`|RJyhnT8jaa	Yes, because I was abducted by aliens, they extracted some of my sperm to make human-alien hybrids|`|atJxwFssaa	I believe but it is only belief.

Can't wait!|`|3005d3b9180d1ef915398a770d0e19f2aa	I think this entire season has been great - they answer just enough questions before throwing more at you.

And then a few months ago we met at a party and we actually had a real conversation for the first time in years. When she had to go home, I gave her my e-mail and she gave me hers and now we're great friends again.

BfdMSoz9aa	Everyone judges by looks, initially, unless you meet someone over a medium where you can't see them (phone, internet, etc), or if you're blind. But I imagine we all speculate in those cases. Looks are of an importance, which may not be derived from our morals and consciences, but an importance that is sometimes necessary. If one is in a bad neighborhood, you have to trust that people dressed as cops are cops, the the person who delivers your mail is actually delivering your mail, etc. Just like knowing a neighborhood helps one get around, knowing what to look for to avoid danger and for various other reasons is important.<br>  <br>  That being said, when it comes to my friends, we either click or we don't. The longest I keep people around who I'm not sure if I'm interested in spending time with is until we click, or until I can tell that we won't. Doesn't matter what they look like to me. Relationships are another story all together. Also, we can't change people, I don't believe. Its more that we can influence them through our words and actions and get them thinking. But change is from within, I think.|`|doha66YWaa	Yes.<br>  I dont give a drat about appearence.<br>  Im not that superficial.|`|a1pmr73vaa	No,I don't discriminate cartoons.|`|LSXdwRDUaa	Nope.. i dont. i look at everyone.|`|qkcxGJq4aa	no, i dont care.<br>  <br>  but im from maine...<br>  <br>  weathered people aren't considered "good looking"|`|RkQGfiQIaa	sometimes a little bit at first, but once i get to know them idc what they look like|`|SuOfRTXzaa	As long as clean and a good person - what else matters|`|NET9UMSGaa	I do at first...but when I get to know them, not anymore|`|grifjdr0aa	No.  If they are clean and nice that's what I care.

Is that what you meant?|`|Lrr1gSFcaa	She's a good actress, But I can't stand her. I don't think she is pretty, she's skinny and gross, I think she's a freak.|`|CPZe3g74aa	Homerecker|`|AKzHpC1Kaa	Overrated. And what's with her lips?! Did she get stung by a bee or something?!|`|AA12041870	I don't know her personally, so there is no way I can give you a good answer to your question|`|BfdMSoz9aa	For what I know of her, as unbiased as possible.. I think she has some talent as an actress. I don't think she's particularly attractive, though her face has a lot of character which is pleasant when one is used to a more generic-type face. I have no place in evaluating her decisions. I thought Brad Pitt & Jenifer Aniston made a cuter couple but its still not my place to judge. And frankly I don't care a great deal, because in the scheme of my life thus far, Angelina Jolie does not matter. Except when it comes to Hackers, because I absolutely love that movie. Which brings me to my last point, that of the movies she's had a major role in that I've seen, I really liked her acting more before she was a big commercial success. I also like her in the Meat Loaf video Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through, because in it she has an intense presence, and is younger with a more natural and youthful look than her current one.<br>  <br>  Billy Bob Thornton & making out with her brother freaked me out a bit.  I think she'd be much better looking, for the record, if she wore her hair down with less makeup and gained at least 20 pounds.|`|6HyFHrfIaa	Overrated, overexposed, oversexed up, over everything. Just tired of hearing about her. She adopts too many children and should have her OWN kids instead of the three she has now. *Scoffs* I mean, it has gotten so bad with this "obsession" with her that now that lame Octomom wants to LOOK like Angelina. America, what has happen to you? Seriously.<br>  <br>  Every time I watch E!, there is always something with "Brangelina this" and "Brangelina that". Sick of it. Tired of seeing them on the red carpet and their kids.|`|uzZuwtgXaa	Caring, good Mother. Not bothered what the press says about her, she lives her own life.

lpyWVR2oaa	Your overall chart needs to be look at more carefully but in general,<br>  Planets in Sagittarius or the 9th House definitely increase the tendency to be attracted to all things foreign, especially if these planets are personal ones - Sun, Moon, mercury, venus, mars etc. If you have other planets in the 9th House as well, this will be more evident in your personality. Incidentally, I have an active 9th House with Mars in Sagittarius and I simply adore all things foreign, especially where culture and communication are concerned.|`|WNWKDw4uaa	Get your Saggitarius out of my venus!|`|vPeNKLK7aa	Astral considerations and personality characteristics have little or no impact upon partner selection in Christian society.  We're just left flapping around in the dark in the hope that 'the one' that we get attached to is correct for us.  Considerable evidence suggests that this approach is flawed in the extreme.  However, it really helps maintain the absolute myth that we are free and have some choice in our lives.  Then, don't forget, once you're wed, the TV does as much as it possibly can to ensure that you'll not stay wed.  It's a shame that so few people understand this.|`|rAD0mL7Saa	it does increase the chances big time. it also represents other things, but falling in love with a foreigner is definitely represented by it.|`|yINAiYDDaa	Hahahaha....|`|zYRK0lDRaa	star sign mean jack ****|`|Vzk8icbIaa	Yes.

Google it if you don't believe me.<br>  <br>  Maybe off-camera, lol.  But she's 16 and he's 19 and they work together; there is no evidence that can lead to a full-blown accusation of a relationship or kiss.  If you just look at the facts, there is no relationship; just friend love.  Sorry, but they are sexy in bed, but not together ;)  <br>  <br>  They play brother and sister on a show; they CANNOT be in a relationship and expect the show to not suffer.  There's even more proof for you that they aren't in a relationship!  <br>  <br>  And really, the number of 19 year olds that date 16-year-olds is kind of minimal.
k4gD8mzyaa	You might like The Doll Master. It's in the Korean language, but it's still scary and has a hugeee twist at the end. You should love it.<br>  <br>  It's about a group of people who have never met. They all get invited to this house where a china-doll making woman is making a doll of them. Although, like any horror movies, people start to die for un-explained reasons. It's very very interesting and from about 10 mins in, you're GLUED to the screen.<br>  <br>  The Hole!<br>  You MUST have seen this film! If not WATCH IT!<br>  A group of teenagers decide to skip their school trip and stay in an underground room. After their weekend inside they realise they're trapped.

Most people would just pick their favorite & be done with it, but if this is done fairly, I believe you'll see there's only one choice.<br>  <br>  Strength- Spider-Man in his weakest incarnation can lift at least 10 tons; Batman has no superhuman strength: Spider-Man<br>  <br>  Speed- Spider-Man can travel at superhuman speeds; Batman can travel at best at peak human speeds: Spider-Man<br>  <br>  Agility- Spider-Man has reflexes an estimated 40 times faster than a normal human's, & has cartilage & tendons designed to allow for superhuman agility; Batman has peak human reflexes & agility: Spider-Man<br>  <br>  Intelligence- Both characters are highly intelligent, & may have various advantages in certain situations over each other: Draw<br>  <br>  Healing ability- Spider-Man has enhanced healing capabilities that can allow him to heal from brutal beatings & broken bones within a day or two; Batman takes days, weeks, or months to heal from the same level of injuries: Spider-Man<br>  <br>  Miscellaneous superpowers- Spider-Man can cling to virtually any surface without aid of gadgets & has his Spider-sense; Batman has no superpowers: Spider-Man<br>  <br>  Resources- Spider-Man is lower middle-class in terms of resources; Batman is a multibillionaire: Batman<br>  <br>  Gadgets- Spider-Man has his webshooters, Spider tracers, Spider-signal, utility belt, & some specialty weapons & costumes; Batman is hard to dispute as the king of gadgets unless we pit him against Inspector Gadget: Batman<br>  <br>  Vehicles- Comic fans the world over have panned the infamous Spider-Mobile; comic fans the world over love the Batmobile & Batman's other modes of transportation: Batman<br>  <br>       In the end, while Batman is a great character, in a one-on-one battle he's no match for the Amazing Spider-Man.  Spider-Man can avoid the Batarangs, sense the other tricks in Batman's arsenal, & use sheer physical abilities to win this fight.|`|slKPLRLaaa	I think Batman because he has money and technology.|`|xkZcDVbjaa	Definitely Spiderman.

ZNQgd84faa	Not gay, just British. <br>  ...and short guys are good lovers.<br>  go Daniel!!|`|vDGFRACaaa	Harry Potter is straight. I'm not sure which Yaoi fanfiction you've been reading. (Was it 'My Immortal'? It was probably 'My Immortal'. Gay Vampyre Potter, he has sex with Draco.)<br>  <br>  Anyways, nobody kisses the Half Blood Prince. That's why he feels unloved and wants to kill everyone with fire.|`|p5ZJfiIaaa	He doesn't kiss the Half-Blood Prince because he doesn't want to cheat on Draco. Harry and Draco are madly in love and Ginny is just a cover for that...<br>  <br>  :)|`|lC5erarUaa	does he kiss THE half blood prince? no but he does kiss someone :D|`|fwRphNvVaa	the half blood prince is Snape, gay or not harry hates him. so no|`|yig566gEaa	uhh...no...|`|GfDX6UuEaa	Harry Potter is straight. Always been, always will be.
B43x5RF8aa	Yes, it does count towards the films run time. Both the beginning AND ending credits count|`|c661ffb50a295d702392241cf59b4170aa	No, that does not include the credits. It is the film's run time. Next time you're nearing the end of a movie push the "display" button on your remote for the DVD player. It will bring up how long the movie has been on, how much is left, as well as the minute details on that particular chapter. A lot of times the "run time" is listed as "Feature Length" or "Feature Run Time" meaning just the actual movie. Now, the opening credits usually count towards the run time, so if you have a film such as Spider-Man or Charlie & the chocolate factory that does the kind of long introduction opening credits, that is usually counted.

a1c47082c5350245c9dbdf316c0424c1aa	YOUR BIRTHDAY: 4 March (PISCES)  <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Your personal ruling planets are Neptune and Uranus.<br>  <br>  You are extremely methodical in your thought but you must learn to temper your opinion and accommodate other people's point of view. Because you are so hard working, you may tend to exceed your physical capacity. You are prone to self criticism.<br>  <br>  The number 4 is an extreme number, especially in its desire for material success. Do not overemphasise the importance of your worldly activity and accomplishments. There seems to be a matter-of-fact quality to you. Your sense of order and tidiness is notable as is your sense of duty. Don't go down the road of preoccupation with self and exaggeration of the negative aspects your own nature.<br>  <br>  Having strong opinions can overrule the need for you to listen with your heart, not just with your ears. Try to empathise with the other person's point of view. An interesting thing about your destiny is that your concept of success doesn't always necessarily equate with a $ value.<br>  <br>  Give some time to your spiritual and inner life.<br>  <br>  Your lucky colours are electric blue, electric white and multi-colours.<br>  <br>  Your lucky gems are Hessonite garnet and agate.<br>  <br>  Your lucky days of the week are Sunday and Thursday.<br>  <br>  Your lucky numbers and years of important change are 4, 13, 22, 31, 40, 49, 58, 67, 76. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Horoscope for today...<br>  <br>  <br>  Wednesday, March 4, 2009<br>  Pisces (Feb 19 - Mar 20) <br>  You may have a lot going on behind your smile today, yet others might not notice. Even if they ask direct questions, you're likely quite smooth as you evade their intellectual probes. But you still need to pay close attention, for someone may also have psychic tentacles that appear to reach into an address file or a chat box without your awareness. Maintaining a smokescreen is a smart idea if you don't want any intruders digging into your private life.|`|DbNbWQflaa	projo.com has a birthday horoscope half way down,the page in between theother ones|`|UPN3zqq6aa	piscies =]<br>  <br>  x

OdN55phmaa	Yep. I went to Turkey 2 years ago with my family. It took us 7 hours to get from Melbourne to Singapore. Then it was on to another plane for a 12 hour flight to Istanbul.

When i found this happening to me i decided to implement a little discipline. what I did was have a composition notebook. I write the date and then the hours, i wrote the things I need to do and decide to do it, as I went along other things needed my attention so  instead of jumping to do them I wrote them down as  to do. this way i created a to do shedule. My goal was to accomplish one thing at the time. There were also things that i wanted to do and there was a conflict between what i should do and what i wanted to do. so i decided to spare saturdays and sundays for the things i wanted to do but during the week concentrated on what was needed. Take a chronometer and set 20 minutes for anything you are doing. when the time is up then move to something else so this way you are chopping to little fractions your time and wont get bored and wandering off. the main thing is to accomplish what needed to be done. reset to 20 more minutes and move on . Also on saturdays and sundays i timed the things i wanted to do. when breaking down time like that you allow your mind to focus your energy in what you are doing if anything pops up write it down and schedule it don't  just go to do it. Do the same when reading or listening to music, commit 20 minutes only and you'll get a lot of things done. in your notebook make sure to mark the things you've done as accomplished, and pay attention to other scheduled things not finished. what you are doing is creating a business diary that will help you all though your life.<br>  good luck.
AA10345820	Yes, I do. I have a silly, sarcastic, slap-stick style of humor that some people just don't understand. I find that there are a lot of people nowadays  that just never learned to be silly.

CBNC40sDaa	As long as your private actions/thoughts do not harm others, then keeping some things to yourself is certainly a healthy thing to do.<br>  <br>  One of the biggest problems in our society is that too many people think that they have to share EVERYTHING with others.|`|7PDD5NlAaa	Yes I think it because we are scared of the other persons reaction.

They can treat me however they want to, and all I can do is try my hardest to find a job and get the hell out. But I'd never talk back to them, I'd let them know how I feel in a non-confrontational way. Communication with people you live with is key to understanding and respect I believe. You get things around the house done before they have to ask you to, that's a bonus, no one complains if you took the garbage out or mowed the lawn, raked the leaves vacuumed the floors or tidied up a bit. Do things so they don't feel like you're a burden and have little respect for you. If someone see's your trying and ACTING like an adult about things, then they should treat you like one. It's hard for some people though, just have to try.|`|9f8XoDKJaa	That depends<br>  <br>  Maybe you do act that way and need to look at yourself.<br>  <br>  On other hand.<br>  <br>  People need to respect who you are.<br>  <br>  Talk to them about it.|`|hVuPqHzsaa	I would never want to live with my family again, I would rather be brought up by wolves than go through again what I went through.|`|4YnoykD2aa	I'd need rope.

They thought they knew who I was, but who they knew was a child who didn't exist anymore. The best way I had of changing their perceptions was by surprising them again and again by being calm, mature, and decisive!<br>  <br>  They wanted to help me in my time of need, so they were letting me live with them. Their choice. They have a right to revoke that. They couldn't physically ground me. They had a right to deny me access to their stuff (tv or whatever) as adults. I figured that if I were living with a roommate who didn't want me using their stuff it would be the same thing. So I stayed cool and thought to I wasn't being punished, I was living with peculiar roommates. Unless I acted like it was a punishment, it wasn't a punishment. This was a serious head trip for them!|`|rzLGCrlfaa	sorry dude but i couldn't do it i'd live in the back of my bronco and maybe they treat you like a kid because you act like you you know no job no house no money|`|376a0b518236d45e27355ee9bd22da43aa	it just would not happen, if your the kind of person that would let someone treat them like a 10 year old well in my opinion they are treating you like you should be.|`|u2lYbPT2aa	You just have to put up with the abuse...<br>  until you find a way, to run...as fast as you can!!<br>                 xoxo agoodgirl_msj|`|yl6kfpzpaa	I act like a 10 year old anyway|`|OpiJAxr1aa	i can think of living with worse people|`|bJtUNkmhaa	dont let it happen is all|`|530fc5625af617fef3f442bfdc20f598aa	You can only become that age again if you let them, they cant force you to become or even act like a ten year old. You must be calm, assertive and make it clear you are now a grown adult and wish to be treated so.

You are in control of your thoughts and actions.  I do not think that the way someone treats you can cause you to act like a kid again.<br>  <br>  Maybe they are treating you like a kid, because you are acting like one....therefore allowing them to.<br>  <br>  Adults take control of their life.  If you truly have no where else to go then be thankful for your family for taking you in, but you should definetly be an ADULT and sit down and talk to them.  Maybe they do not understand that they are making you feel this way.<br>  <br>  You should respect their feelings because you are living with them, but you deserve respect too.|`|DCkTGSLjaa	dont even put yourself in this situation|`|aWT6XXpLaa	10 would be a few years more mature for me.

dSmoB64Yaa	There were a lot of films that tried to have a bit more gritty realism, more natural Dialogue and stronger subject matter, that appealed to a younger, adult audience, in the late 60s.<br>  <br>  OK, So I'm cheating, by picking some of my favorite films of that era, but  most of them broke a lot of rules, including standards for Dialogue at the time.<br>  <br>  Easy Rider 1969 (One of the first films to feature a large soundtrack of popular rock music. It changed the way film makers approached the use and marketing of soundtracks).<br>  <br>  Midnight Cowboy 1969<br>  <br>  Coolhand Luke 1967<br>  <br>  The Graduate 1967<br>  <br>  In the Heat of the Night 1967<br>  <br>  In Cold Blood 1967<br>  <br>  Bonnie and Clyde 1967<br>  <br>  Bullitt 1968<br>  <br>  Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid 1969<br>  <br>  The Wild Bunch 1969<br>  <br>  2001 A Space Odyssey 1968<br>  <br>  But, yeah, let's not forget some of the method actors of the 50s like Dean and Brando, who starred in movies with heavily scripted dialogue, but they acted in a more improvised style|`|sYqSMmWoaa	"Method" acting first showed up in American film in the mid nineteen fifties, famously utilized by James Dean. Check Rebel Without a Cause or Giant.|`|v2SLmMCyaa	I don't think films from the Golden Age of Hollywood are over-scripted or overacted at all.  I think that was just the style of delivering lines.  You should watch Bringing Up Baby (Howard Hawks 1938)  I think that resembles what you are categorizing as unnatural dialogue.  However, a lot of the dialogue in that film was improvised by Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn.|`|fZEVgFe8aa	Nashville directed by Robert Altman

It looks like suicide because the person dies of too much nitrous, laughing gas. Being a doctor, it looks like an overdose.<br>  <br>  As for Christian, he will have to accept his mistake and cheat on Liz as she can cheat on him. Perhaps Kimber can join in as they are already into threeways.<br>  <br>  I am still thinking the baby is Christian's and not Matt's. I think that is what she wanted to say but didn't.<br>  <br>  Don't be surprised if the honeymoon happens and they come back having figured it all out while Teddy sinks her claws deeper into Sean.|`|mSt1LGfjaa	no darn it i missed it,,|`|vBt5Dp09aa	it was a great episode... i hope christian and lizzie have a great marriage.  but we all know christian very well and he will be out there when they get to italy (italian ladies) a new area for christian to dominate.  <br>  <br>  lol but i hope he changes for the better and becomes a great husband and father for once ;)<br>  <br>  eventually teddy will make sean marry her and then she will kill him to.  i knew she was up to no good since the 1st time she appeared on the show. <br>  <br>  lizzie should of walked down the aisle to kimber and knocked her out right there lmao...

I deleted my accounts -|`|GfG4PfjMaa	Sure, I can agree with you that internet socializing is boring for some people and I can also agree that for other's it's can be exciting, fun and stimulating.<br>  <br>  It depends upon the person.  <br>  <br>  This page for Yahoo Answers is a part of "internet socializing".<br>  <br>  I have watched teenagers on myspace/facebook and boy, I don't see it.  But I have my own "socializing network" within Yahoo 360 and love it.<br>  <br>  I think that it can be exciting and the way to make that possible is to "get in, where you fit in".  <br>  <br>  Some people like the "dating" sites, Some like the "adult" sites.  There are quite a few "educational sites", and another one of my personal favorites is "Second Life", that internet socializing taken to the next level.<br>  <br>  So maybe you haven't found the social network that fits your personality.  Maybe if you went to Second Life or one of the other 3D life mimicking sites, you will find a whole world of excitement that can be fun, educational and exciting.<br>  <br>  And for the most part makes Facebook and My Space dim by comparision.<br>  <br>  And get you some friends to join you.  The more the merrier.<br>  <br>  Learn to create things in SL like homes and there are classes on writing scripts and you will be amazed at all the things you can do and you can join for free.<br>  <br>  The internet social world can mean different things to different people, it's important that we respect other people's right to choose what they like as we want them to respect what we like.|`|lcNPeZOeaa	I agree. its not only boring but also very dangerous. you just dont know the person with whom ur socialising might just turn out to be a serial killer, rapist. psycho, paedophile and what not! im not trying to be very cynical or paranoid, just tryinna be realistic. Cyber crime is increasing by the day.<br>  <br>  before the advent of technology, socialising with friends was so much more fun. now, outdoor activities have been replaced to a large extent by computer-addiction. though its not an extremely huge problem right now, it might just turn into one in a few years!!|`|yl6kfpzpaa	I've never had a facebook account and my myspace lasted about 7 minutes, if i wanted people to know stuff bout me i'd go outside and  yell it at random people till the police come.|`|QCkRRqVwaa	Yeah, once everyone you care about stops talking to you.|`|4SdJxgCraa	ii agree with colin C! .. facebook is addicting and you could waste ur time with it .. but my space..

uCO4ZTAtaa	I think the only judges that should be on American Idol are Randy and Simon...Hello their always right!|`|g5RS83paaa	I have a feeling Paula will be gone next year, last week she was really out of it, it's like watching a train wreck--you can't look away. I hope she doesn't go|`|2ab0f4f84a201bc39a3fb4a1b64db222aa	I totally disagree. I think Kara is one of the best judges.  And i cant believe how they added her just in season 8 and she's an AMAZING JUDGE.|`|3c51ba3982b4a0fa984f838020963690aa	Yep, fourth judge is a crowd.  Go back to the original 3 -- Randy, Paula and Simon -- those three are what have really made American Idol what it is -- along with Seacrest as the host.  It wouldn't be as successful with anyone else in their places.  Other shows have tried and tried with the table of judges and a host -- but no one compares to the AI cast and their chemistry.  It just works.  They need to stick with it, but no, they had to go and ruin it by adding Kara.  No offense to Kara, but ANYONE who'd be added to this group would throw it off and ruin it.  <br>  Problem is -- I heard a rumor that Paula's contract will be up by the end of the year and she may plan to be done with AI.  So Kara may have been a setup to slip in and take her spot anyway.  :(|`|KmC0K59taa	I don't like having 4 judges, but I do like Kara.  Randy has hardly said anything all season.  I like him, but he just sits there.  Kara knows what she is talking about.  You're right about Paula, she's just f'ed up all the time and rambles incoherently.<br>  <br>  So I vote they oust Randy if they oust anyone.|`|PZjmWdW8aa	they should get rid of paula not kara|`|ld1vh7nHaa	do you know what's great about you and your question.......|`|6d718b2ca0424bba8e88fd0bd7a40273aa	I actually didn't mind at first, I like some of Kara's insight but it does drag down the show a bit because it takes a while to get through the critiques. I think it won't seem as bad when there are fewer contestants, but for now it's really noticeable. Also, Kara is ok but I feel as if she tries to hard and though her points are good insider points she does play favoritism too much. So even though Paula can be annoying I think Cara's presence pushes Paula to be more coherent with her critiques. She doesn't just gush she tries to form a an insightful review in that regard I like Cara. So I'm a little torn about the new format. I like it and I don't. We did some kind of mix up with the judging though.|`|MeGehliuaa	Simon is the most honest, but the most negative person I've ever met. Randy's in the middle so I would go with him. Paula is extremely positive, I don't understand why some think that her always having something good to say is bad. Kara actually spiced it up now, I've gotten used to her. I've tried imagining AI w/o Kara, I didn't like it.|`|AA11706809	I think Kara is more insightful than Paula; I hope she takes Paula's place. I agree 4 is too much, but I think Paula should go. She never has anything interesting to say. She's just there so when people do horribly, she can say at least one thing positive. You know if Paula says you did bad, you really did bad.|`|LPgYKc3Kaa	I know, it seems the more judges, the more wasted time listening to all the crap that comes out of their mouths.  I truly like what Simon has to say, although sometimes he can be crass, but all in all he is always right.  Paula, on the other hand, OMG, please put duck tape over her mouth!

Qih2hKqkaa	Yeah, it was a party in the sky.  I've got some really great stories!|`|g2QUNwZzaa	i've never been in a plane before. even still, i dont think im old enough for it to have even been possible for me to smoke on a plane. i'd probably try to sneak one in the bathroom. after all, what are they gonna do? kick me out of the plane?<br>  <br>  this question made me want a cigarette *spark spark* *puff puff*|`|XpKY04Tnaa	Yes! I guess that's why I really hate flying now. I'm still remembering what it was like before all this B.S.|`|Xnx7p7OHaa	Sure did.|`|fA42bQHraa	Yes, the smoking aspect was pretty nasty when I think back on it.<br>  <br>  The back seats of the plane were a smoking area and, combine that with drinking, and you get people smoking a lot of cigarettes in a confined area. <br>  <br>  People did drink more, there was less judgement about it and it could be fun. On the other hand some people would get really stupid and it could be very unfun for the stewards/stewardesses and people that didn't want to get disturbed by obnoxious drunks.<br>  <br>  I like that things are more restrained now because it's less likely that a few people will make the flight unpleasent for everyone else.<br>  <br>  The world was complicated and evil then too, we just didn't have several 24 hour news networks telling us every bad thing that happened everywhere in the world every day.|`|PGFmTbUOaa	Not exactly - but I got stuck on a flight to New York from London on 9/11. We had to land at Halifax, Nova Scotia. Because we weren't due to land there, we all had to stay on the plane for the best part of 10 hours while the Canadians decided what to do with us. <br>  <br>  In the meantime we were given all the little miniatures of spirits we could handle (I held on to mine every time they came around and just put them in my bag) and those who smoked were allowed to at the back of the plane - where the air stewards normally stay to prepare food and stuff (they had no food to prepare because they had to quickly clear it away when we had to make the emergency landing, because the first plane had gone into the tower). <br>  <br>  I remember thinking even then - this is probably the only time I'll ever see someone smoking on a plane and given the opportunity to get completely trashed. But given what was happening - people around me felt the need for it.|`|pR4Hwmpbaa	Nope. I did fly back before they quit giving out every last little thing to "coach" passengers... back before all the 9/11 precautions. <br>  <br>  <br>  I haven't flown in almost 15 years...|`|CPZA5qrGaa	1982 Flew from Bridgeport, Ct.<br>  Peoples air-line worst flight and my last flight.<br>  I don't like close calls especially at that height and at that speed.<br>  I haven't taken to the skies since.|`|HzjeKsDJaa	yes but I haven't flown since 9-11, I remember when we could smoke in our office building and restaurants, ah those were the days|`|AA11777294	Yes those were the days|`|tIGyEDEUaa	yep, sure did.|`|rzLGCrlfaa	sadly no lol i don't think i could go on a 5 hour flight i'd be grinding my teeth down to nothing|`|r8Aar6sZaa	no|`|AA10106002	Yes, and no one died.|`|S1A20Oouaa	Yes, those were the good old days!!!

The fact that I can do that for them makes me feel like I've got something to offer to the world around me and really adds that special feeling to my days.<br>  <br>  I think when you've got a good combination of both receiving that acceptance and giving it to others then you have a good chance of feeling special more often than you don't!|`|e123ba186cea4e32b1880639ba3d784daa	Cheetos.|`|mh5NOsWzaa	funny i do the same thing but my gf think im insulting her intelligence|`|c4ESPPNlaa	A guy I met online.

CvtDsOB4aa	Most Places I've Seen <br>  Will Charge a $1.00 More for Larger|`|8tRY1U2Iaa	I know that sometimes at concerts and stuff, a small T-shirt and an extra-large T-shirt sell for the same price. I usually go for extra-large because you get more for your money.|`|iqZUd5Fdaa	You are right. It would cost a little extra to make, but only a very small amount, probably something like 0.5p, they buy the material in massive bulk, so an extra few inches doesnt amount to much. And yeah they would flog bigger things cheaper as they dont generally look as appealing as the smaller ones and less people are an 18/XXL or above|`|HmqHf3qDaa	the margins for clothing are set by manufacturers,to absorb these costs,|`|mkJ9uzWPaa	Large sizes are more expensive, certainly in all clothing shops I've been in. It may be at sale time they sell the "extreme" sizes off more cheaply but not on the standard every day price.<br>  <br>  I also used to work for a clothing manufacturer and we charged more for the larger sizes. The converse costing argument applies that if we sell 10 dozen size 12, but 1 dozen size 20, there's not only more fabric required for the larger size, but more labour. It takes just as long to set the machine up to lay and cut fabric for 120 items as it does 12.
jcL7gDMKaa	Be patient with him. maybe he is having some problems of his own just now|`|uD1S5dYtaa	There are many reasons he could be acting that way, and none have anything to do with the cusp.  He could have Mercury in Gemini, he could have Gemini rising, he could have a preponderance of air signs, he could have more mutable signs than any other.  Not much can be told about a person just from their Sun Sign.|`|AsLTO8CTaa	i think it has more to do with that gemini cusp bc i too am a taurus and i do have my moods but i tell my bf when im in my moods and he knows to let me be but it doesnt happen often only when im stressed about something|`|QFJ8FGcLaa	maybe it has something to do with how stubborn they are|`|BKrVqOgiaa	Kylie,<br>  Your particular Taurus must have an Air Sign ascending, because "wishy-washiness" is certainly uncharactertistic of Taurus, male or female.   As an Earth Sign, Taurus individuals unfailingly stick to their guns: in fact, one of the innate characteristics of the sign is the trait that some people call "stubbornness", but I prefer to think of as "tenacity".|`|LU0tIFcRaa	Taurus females can be like that too. I'm a taurus, and I am wishy washy myself. We're moody ppl and can be unpredictable sometimes. Most ppl tell me I act like a gemini. But I will tell u this, one min we seem like we're into u, the next min we act like we don't like u,or for that matter know u. We don't really mean to be like though. If we like u, u may never even know it, we stand back and size u up to see what ur made of. So, he could be doing that.

pTERJdzQaa	My question to you is: When have I never been Inspired by Anime?!!!!<br>  <br>  I LIVE FOR ANIME!!!! Anime influenced about 90% of mu life and my Life choices, I have literallt dedicated my life to Anime, I have sold my entire soul to Anime.<br>  <br>  How can you not be Inspired by Anime!!!! There ares om many different Anime with all kind of scenarios that pertain to real life and real life issues and experiences, I have been watching Anime since I was about 2yrs. old, Pokemon was the first Anime that Influenced me, I was watching pokemon when I was being potty trained!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  I first decided to pursue Anime and Manga as a life goal when I was 11yrs old(In 2005), I am 15yrs old now, I hope that I will make it as a Manga author and Anime producer, voice actor etc.<br>  <br>  If I do make it as a MAnga Artist then I am going to make some mind-blowing Manga, and Im going to produce some Awesome Anime.<br>  <br>  Thanx for Asking.<br>  <br>  [Edit] Sorry...I made a critical typing error when I was talking about my age, If you read this answer earlier before I edited it just now, the part where is said that I first wanted to become a Manga artist in 2005, and I said since in was 13 and Im 15, Im meant to say since I was 11yrs old, I made a mistake about the year because it is 2009 and I gain the Idea 4yrs. ago, so I was 11yrs old back then, not 13yrs old. Sorry.....|`|3NLThcMUaa	Well, mainstream general anime doesn't inspire me (i.e. Ouran, Case Closed, Fullmetal Alchemist).<br>  <br>  But works like that of Hayao Miyazaki does. For years I was fascinated with how there's so much detail not just in the characters but backgrounds and overall scenery (Howl's bedroom, the cities and bar of Porco Rosso, the stone and moss of Laputa). It really opened me up to loosening myself as a digital artist and taking on the much more natural painted look.|`|KziEj8zzaa	of course... i mean yes.... first in naruto... i was inspired by the things he said... "Im not going back on my words" (i think that's it i can't get the right words though...)^^ and in prince of tennis "mada mada dane" actually the prince of tennis is the one that made me a tennis player...and you know what? im not good! hahahha but im going to train harder aja! ^^... and im trying to draw my fav anime char.... ^^|`|2xKmEyTWaa	<a href="http://www.naruto-network.net/bleach209.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.naruto-network.net/bleach209....</a><br>  <br>  THE legendary Detective L!!<br>  me and my friends fighting over who will be L|`|huUZvD0Oaa	Yes, I have been inspired by Nodame Cantabile anime.

I have noticed hat sometimes the styles can be too similr and personally when I'm reading comic books I like to see different artists and their different styles of drawing.|`|SLBb7uWgaa	Yeah. It inspires me a lot. Especially Naruto. On how to value friends. How to reach all your goals in life, just believe that you can reach it. <br>  I don't know why, but I can relate myself to an Anime, sometimes it makes me cry and lough out loud.

6HyFHrfIaa	It is relatively easy. It may be a little hard too explain but to hard to actually put it on Answers but it is not as hard like they say it is. You've ever seen a E7#9 chord? This is chord is also referred to as "The Jimi Hendrix" chord. This chord is just (Now I showing you finger wise and where to put the fingers on the fret) you index on the 7th fret-A string, middle finger on the 6th fret-D string, ring finger on the 7th fret-G string and the pinky on the 8th fret-B string. There is your E7#9 chord.<br>  <br>  When playing a F#m, this is super easy. In third position, place your ring finger in the 4th fret of the D string and your index finger will cover the 2 frets of the G-B-High E strings. The F#m will look like this:<br>  ___(F#m)__(A7)___(E7#9)<br>  E------2---------3-------------------<br>  B------2---------2----------8-----<br>  G------2---------2----------7-----<br>  D------4---------2----------6-----<br>  A-----------------0----------7-----<br>  E-------------------------------------...|`|qGh1HhPwaa	Not similar, the same.<br>  A chord is a collection of notes that together produce a sound<br>  You do have to memorize it<br>  <br>  I find it so much easier on the piano|`|UhV82EaXaa	a chord is just a series of notes played together 2 make a chord, if u play piano it shoud be rather simlpe.

WzMM760laa	Cow and Chicken is an Emmy Award-nominated American animated television series, created by David Feiss. The series shows the adventures of a cow, named Cow, and her chicken brother, named Chicken. They are often tormented by the Red Guy, a usually pants-less devil-like character who poses as various characters to scam or hurt them, as seen in the episodes "Supermodel Cow and Part Time Job". The series was nominated for an Emmy Award in 1996 and 1998.[1]<br>  <br>  Like Dexter's Laboratory and other Cartoon Network series from the 1990s, the original pilot appeared as an episode of the series What a Cartoon!. The Cow and Chicken series first broadcast on Cartoon Network from 1997 to the year 2000, with reruns airing prominently on the network until 2004. Late into the series run, the characters I Am Weasel and I.R. Baboon, who were part of the series' recurring segment, I Am Weasel, were another counterpart onto their own series.<br>  [edit] Premise<br>  Cow and Chicken are sister and brother, a cow and a chicken, but who have human parents whose faces are never seen in any episode (although there are references where you can see their shadows of their upper halves). There is one episode when cow is digging in the closet and pulls out what would be their upper halves and refers to them as their science projects. The creators were faced with the question of whether and how to explain this scenario. Sometimes opening credits are cumbersome vehicles for an origin story. David Feiss approached this problem in the series' opening title sequence: Mama had a chicken/Mama had a cow/Dad was proud/He didn't care how. This is all that is ever offered in explanation, though there is one hint in the episode "The Day I Was Born" that Cow is adopted, while Chicken's paternity is unknown.<br>  <br>  Cow and Chicken's extended family consists of various other types of animals, including Cousin Boneless, who is a boneless chicken (unable to walk or get up from the floor); Snail Boy, a snail; Cousin Black Sheep, a sheep; and Sow, an evil pig. They also have an uncle Longhorn Steer, who appears in "Professor Longhorn Steer". The episode "Happy Meat" also showed the ghosts of a pair of Cow and Chicken's ancestors, a male farmer married to a female chicken.<br>  History<br>   <br>  Poster to the Cow and Chicken pilot No Smoking: The Original PilotThe idea of Cow and Chicken first existed as a story that David Feiss had made for his daughter.[2] Feiss was a cartoonist who had worked with Hanna Barbera and related projects since 1978.[2]<br>  <br>  Later, Feiss was called to submit any ideas he had for the series "What a Cartoon!", a series that was comprised of various cartoon shorts from various creators and writers. Feiss submitted three ideas for the series, one of which was Cow and Chicken.[3] Cow and Chicken premiered on the "What a Cartoon!" series in 1995. Although most cartoons in the series had never gone beyond one short, Hanna Barbera had decided to turn Cow and Chicken into full series, following many letters from fans asking for more Cow and Chicken Cartoons.[3]<br>  <br>  The new Cow and Chicken series premiered on July 7, 1997, and ran for 52 episodes through 1999. Reruns continued to be shown on Cartoon Network until 2004. The show also included a cartoon called I Am Weasel as a supporting segment; this segment was spun-off as an independent series late in the show's run.<br>  <br>  Cow and Chick was notable in that a single actor, Charlie Adler, voiced four leading roles of Cow, Chicken, the Red Guy, and I. R. Baboon (much like how Mel Blanc voiced many characters in the Warner Brothers' Merrie Melodies and Looney Tunes series). Other actors provided supporting voices, including Dan Castellaneta (the voice of Earl).

iVNYlCyJaa	Well it certainly doesnt sounds stupid to me. There are very few people who possess the gift that u have. I dont know how astrology has too much to do with it. Coz i see a lot of pisces rising people and scorp sun and they dont have such wonderful gifts. <br>  I read a book written by mark Salem. He had the same gifts as u. Dont worry about these jerks here or wat others say when u tell them. People dont understand such things and so are reluctant to accept it or even help others who have it.  <br>  <br>  It is a god given gift. And 99.99% people who have no such gifts wont understand them. I wish you find a person who can mentor u to develop this exceptional gifts. And yes. U totally need to have belief in this special power of urs. <br>  <br>  u Are a choosen lucky one. All the best.

Sagittarians I have seen first hand do it toooo many times. Kind of sad really b/c apparently Leos are their 'soulmates' and I see the Leos being extremely loyal to the sags and then getting really hurt in the end, whereas the sags just up and keep it moving!

6HyFHrfIaa	Yes. Aquarius people hate, HATE being rejected. Although they may appear calm, cool and relaxed, underneath that "emotionless" personality lies a youthful child seeking enjoyment and relaxation. The whole part with you "not caring" is a definite plus to the Aquarius personality. It is because Airs signs forget more often than the other three and simply move on with that "Oh well" persona. <br>  <br>  However, this girl must've done something REALLY bad.|`|e14b1125c91fafed4795c69469f8b509aa	Yes, it's normal. We are still human after all :) Whenever someone I care about does me wrong it stays on my mind and I go crazy thinking about them and what they did. I don't just detach like Aquarians are said to do and forget about it. Deep down, we're actually one of the most sensitive signs on the inside but we just feel awkward expressing it outwardly. There are so many misconceptions about Aquarians that sometimes, we question our own selves when it comes to feeling emotions like it's abnormal or not usual for us. We feel deeply though and do care just as much as anyone else. We just show it differently but dealing with our sadness or anger in solitude and privacy. Perhaps, that's why people think we're so cold--because they hardly see us cry. We know how we feel though and that's all that counts ;)|`|R2hbZi1Faa	I'm also aquarius and trust me I've been bruised more than once. It usually happens to me when I least expect it and I hold grudges for a very long time after. Usually when I get over it I somehow get stronger, however more careful. I think it doesn't really depend on the sign because every once in a while you'll end up hurt. What you shouldn't do is let this experience ruin the next one.Give yourself some time to heal and don't force it.|`|rAD0mL7Saa	yes. Aquarians actually need love more than you'd think. A typically Aquarias trait is to build foundations and expand on them and feel lost without a solid 'home base".

24UPDIBTaa	First attempt:<br>  <br>  Could it be Silly Symphonies' "The Grasshopper and the Ants" from 1934? See links below.<br>  <br>  From wikipedia:<br>  "Happier" versions of the fable show the ants taking pity and giving the grasshopper some food, on the premise that turning the grasshopper away in his time of need is also morally questionable. A prime example is the 1934 animated short subject produced by Walt Disney. The Queen of the Ants decrees that the grasshopper may stay in the ant colony, but he must play his fiddle in return for his room and board. He agrees to this arrangement, and the ant tunnels become a grand ballroom where all the ants happily dance to the music of the grasshopper, who finally learns that he needs to make himself useful. Notably, this short introduced the song "The World Owes Me a Livin'", which would later become a signature tune for Goofy.<br>  <br>  2nd attempt: I tried looking for old cartoons with bees, and think I may have found what you're looking for. However, it's from 1941, so maybe I'm just further off track here.<br>  <br>  The movie has been released under three different names--<br>  Mr. Bug Goes to Town, Hoppity Goes to Town and Bugville. Any of those ring a bell?<br>  <br>  wikipedia:<br>  "The plot describes the return of Hoppity the Grasshopper, after a period spent away, to an American city. He finds that all is not as he left it, and his good insect friends (who live in the "lowlands" just outside the garden which belongs to a songwriter and his wife) are now under threat from the 'human ones', who are trampling through the broken down fence which prefaces the property, using it as a shortcut.<br>  <br>  Insect houses are being flattened by their feet, and are also often burned by cast away cigar butts and matches. Old Mr Bumble and his beautiful daughter Honey (Hoppity's childhood sweetheart) are in grave danger of losing their Honey Shop to this threat.<br>  <br>  To compound their problems, devious insect "property magnate" C. Bagley Beetle has romantic designs on Honey Bee himself, and hopes, with the help of his henchmen Swat the Fly and Smack the Mosquito, to force Bumble to give him her hand in marriage."<br>  <br>  See more info in links below.

And is still alive through them.<br>  <br>  The next Step of the DCAU, it should have been Green Lantern Corps, a Space Opera with all the Great Characters of the Cosmic side of the DC Universe, (Guy Gardner Rocks), another very interesting aproach Should have been Justice Society of America (with their multigeneratonal cast of characters).<br>  <br>  And, Yes, Marvel attempts Sucks.<br>  But i Like Spectacular Spiderman.|`|PhCGFouvaa	I have asked almost this same question a week ago and here's the best answer from User "Cyber Ninja":<br>  <br>  DC<br>  Green Lantern: First Flight (coming soon)<br>  Superman/Batman: Public Enemies (coming soon)<br>  Teen Titans: The Judas Contract (coming soon)<br>  Justice League: Worlds Collide (coming soon)<br>  <br>  MARVEL<br>  Thor: Tales of Asgard (coming soon)<br>  Planet Hulk (coming soon)<br>  <br>  Although they're all Coming Soon though!<br>  <br>  And also don't missed the Wonder Woman DVD movie, it was released around the same time with Hulk vs Wolverine/Thor.|`|wR8yViaVaa	There's a Green Lantern movie slated for 2011, I believe. I could see an animated series focused around the Green Lantern Corps being at least somewhat worthwhile, though probably geared towards a younger audience as these animated features tend to be, despite the significantly more mature nature of modern DC comics.|`|wZsKG8bPaa	They are currently doing Batman : The brave and the bold.  Kind of a team up deal.  It is set apart from the Batman:TAS and JLU stuff.  More kid friendly.  <br>  <br>  Other than that, look for more direct to DVD movies like we have seen the past year or two.|`|ZfsgIDa0aa	the DCAU is pretty much dead in terms of series'. I'm really certain they're only releasing movies from now on. From what I know there's Teen Titans (not related to the cartoon series), Wonder Woman and Justice League (I'm pretty sure it's not based on the the central DCAU's Justice League. Kind of like Justice League: New Frontier, except modern). Aaaaaand who knows, maybe they'll make a new series.

capSLZQXaa	You can be ANY age to buy any amount of rated R tickets for a movie. MPAA ratings are not law. It is up to the movie theaters whether they wish to enforce the MPAA rating system or not. You can't really complain though, because individual movie theaters' rules vary, and that just may be one of their rules at the theater you went to.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: Purdyflo.......double check your information. MPAA ratings ARE NOT law. A movie doesn't even have to submit themselves for rating(of course, by not doing so, a movie will definitely hurt its distribution).Here's a website about the MPAA:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bigscreen.com/MPAA_RatingsInfo.php#RatingLaw" rel="nofollow">http://www.bigscreen.com/MPAA_RatingsInf...</a><br>  <br>  "Is the rating system a law?<br>  No, the rating system is strictly voluntary and carries no force of law."<br>  <br>  While your theater may enforce MPAA standards, they DO NOT HAVE TO BY LAW.<br>  <br>  Yes, Alcohol and cigarettes are illegal to minors, but adult content CDs, Video Games, Books and DVDs are not(it's entirely up to the seller whether they want to sell them to minors or not, and yes, they could be sued, but the case would hold no water).<br>  <br>  From the MPAA itself:<br>  "HOW THE RATING SYSTEM IS USED BY THEATER OWNERS AND VIDEO RETAILERS<br>  <br>  Motion picture theater owners, who co-founded the rating system in 1968, were the first group in the entertainment industry to voluntarily enforce its guidelines. NATO estimates that the majority of the theater owners in the nation observe the rating system. In the mid 1980s as home video grew in popularity, video retailers joined theater owners in embracing the voluntary guidelines of the rating system. Parents who relied on the rating system found that the information provided by the rating classifications were equally helpful in home video. To facilitate its use, ratings are displayed on both the entire home entertainment package and the videocassettes and DVDs themselves. <br>  <br>  The Video Software Dealers Association (VSDA), which is the major trade association for video retailers in the United States, has adopted a policy which strongly endorses the observance of the voluntary movie rating system by video retailers. "<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mpaa.org/Ratings_Purpose.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.mpaa.org/Ratings_Purpose.asp</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Notice the word "VOLUNTARY" strewn throughout the statement......|`|fB5e1GKraa	if there was a wookie in lee's pants, you'd know it, eyes up son. keep your eyes up!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|WfLWLSXdaa	An R-rated motion picture, in the view of the Rating Board, contains some adult material. An R-rated motion picture may include adult themes, adult activity, hard language, intense or persistent violence, sexually-oriented nudity, drug abuse or other elements, so that parents are counseled to take this rating very seriously. Children under 17 are not allowed to attend R-rated motion pictures unaccompanied by a parent or adult guardian. Parents are strongly urged to find out more about R-rated motion pictures in determining their suitability for their children. Generally, it is not appropriate for parents to bring their young children with them to R-rated motion pictures.<br>  <br>  <br>  Some say you have to be 21 or older to take another person age under 17, but I have not seen it in writing.  <br>  <br>  Hope that helps|`|nhzHUXpVaa	I work at a movie theater. You have to be 17 or with your parent or guardian. You can't just be with some one over 17 or have your parents permission, it has to be there parents. Unlike what the guy said above, It is the law, just like cigarettes and alcohol. There is a possibility that theaters could loose their license because of this or even to the extreme of being sued.  Alot of people get mad about this, but it even says at the bottom of movie posters and in the ads and stuff that you must be 17 or accompanied by a parent or guardian. I guess its so like if your in the middle of a movie and the parent decides the movie isn't appropriate they can make their kid leave. Which I have seen happen. It's dumb I know. I've heard this whole shpeel from my boss many times. I hate having to card people, I feel stupid sometimes. And sometimes I feel bad, like in your situation where some of them can get in and their other friends can't. But sometimes its fun to reject them, especially dumb middle schoolers!<br>  <br>  thesnuff...  Man my boss is such a moron! He always thinks he knows stuff but doesn't! Your right!

AA11025703	The anime ender after 51 episodes and a theactrical movie release. There is also a manga.<br>  <br>  With the Anime/Manga it's not so much a matter of better, or worse, just very, very different. I've enjoyed both quite a bit.<br>  <br>  The Manga is still running strong. I have volumes 1-11 and numbers 13 & 14<br>  <br>  As I understand it there will soon be a good bit of delay for anymore FMA manga in English as the English volumes are coming out so often that they are catching up to the Japanese versions.<br>  <br>  A piece of advice, buy the manga on eBay if you can. I got the first 10 volumes in a bundle for around $40-$60. It is around $107.00 to buy them from book stores.<br>  <br>  The 2 stories are very different. The differences become profound around episode 25 of Fullmetal Alchemist.<br>  <br>  The Homunculi, both their names, genders, and ways of being made are different.<br>  <br>  The Anime was made while the Manga was just starting, so allot of the foundations of the Anime were made up on the fly and aren't the same as the Manga.<br>  <br>  In the Manga atagonist is Father (a more or less) evil twin of Hohenheim, while in the Anime it's Dante a former lover of Hohenheim.<br>  <br>  Pride is named Wrath in the Manga. Wrath from the Anime doesn't exist. Wrath in the Anime is .... revealed later in the series:D<br>  <br>  The differences become profound around episode 25 of Fullmetal Alchemist<br>  <br>  That said, a Second Fullmetal Alchemist Anime series is in development, and supposedly will be closer to the Manga.  Honestly, the could make several Anime, (which has happened before) each being closer to the actual Manga.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Yep, the storylines from the anime is different from the manga. <br>  <br>  Square Enix wrote the script for FMA for the anime.<br>  <br>  The creator created the video game and manga.<br>  <br>  Fullmetal Alchemist was based off from a video game, except the heroine isn't in there and so is a few other characters.<br>  <br>  What's also different between the anime and manga is that the manga has some new characters.|`|ruv8C3DEaa	Yes,it's true.Hiromu arakawa(Genius behind fullmetal alchemist) wanted the anime staff to work independently from her and requested having to make a different ending from the one in the manga(which is still ongoing).|`|4Zj9eYgPaa	The anime is similar to the manga to a certain part of the story. It follows the manga to the 7th volume or so, only changing some minor scenes, but after that point, it's all original work since the author left that in the hands of the production staff. Because of that, a lot of important scenes weren't included in the anime and new ones were made, changing greatly the story, and consequently not including some characters that appeared in the manga. As for the movie, it's completely original, being the characters and the concept the only things that connect it to the manga.<br>  <br>  That's why they are making a new season in April, to entirely follow the original manga story.|`|pCBymUayaa	Yes, there are innumerable differences between the anime and manga.  I don't want to spoil anything if you haven't seen/read one or the other, so I'll just say this:  The manga and the (original) anime are the same initially, but branch apart fairly early on, keeping very few things similar afterward.  The new anime that starts in April will follow the manga plot exclusively and will probably have a very long, sprawling run.  I've seen/read both (granted, the manga is still going) and, personally, found the show to be much more complex, interesting, dark, and better written.|`|SLBb7uWgaa	The difference is that, in anime there's only Hohenheim while in manga there are 2 Hohenheim. Anime is finish but in manga is still going on (I guess it's right). In Manga they added some characters.

uD1S5dYtaa	Although this person seems flighty he/she is a very caring, sensitive, nurturing person. This person takes time to think things through and may frustrate you in the process because of your lightening fast thought process. You are a very active person, but there are times when you wonder if what you do is really what you need.  Even tho' your Sun is in Aries, with Pisces rising you not only appear and project a Pisces its possible that your Sun is in the 12th house which is the traditional house of Pisces.  This gives you a very strong Piscean influence in your chart.

Another one I remember is a girl is hanging naked and she has water sprayed on her untill she is frozen, another one is their is a girl that has to dip her hand in acid to get a key out or her ribs will be ripped from her chest. then The last one I remember is there is a guy in a machine that turns each part of his body untill it breaks then untill it gets to his head then it breaks his neack. yes they all die.

aLIVdFtoaa	I think it was dirt or grease b/c she had the flat tire when she was coming back with the ice sculpture for the wedding and was carrying it in the stroller when Orson picked her up on the side of the road.  I don't remember Wayne hitting her while he had Katerine/Bree held  hostage in the house.
AA11706809	obviously whitney pulled the girl's hair first and that started it.<br>  what the hell makes them bad girls? that was the sorriest excuse for a fight i've ever seen. where was all the boxing? where was the chi-town beat down? they're all a joke. where are they getting these chicks? maybe they had to focus more on looks this season because of the events they participated in.<br>  <br>  it's been said before and i'll say it again, ailea needs her *** beat. she is super fake and phony, and she's dating her dad.<br>  <br>  now the other amber, that didnt fight, she's a straight punk- i don't know how she got on the show. they are wrong for picking on her, but she wont even stick up for herself or her friend.<br>  <br>  edit- lol, i just thought it was funny that we both used the term "straight up punk"|`|DHzwr1braa	I don't remember seeing tiffany pull Amber's hair. I saw Aleia the **** talker pull Amber's hair. Tiffany was trying to get the shoe out of Amber's hand.<br>  <br>  YESSSSSS Aliea is so annoying. she can't fight her own battles and shes a straight up punk. She started talking crap when she found out all the girls had her back.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah and whitney is also annoying she talks to much ****. Amber is actually very nice she tried to make peace with them, but they weren't having it. Amber is a little fighter too, she doesn't take any bs.|`|na8ObA5Haa	i want all of the fab five to go home! they are so lame and annoying! i hate alilea the most though! she thinks she is so hard and scary...and she is the opposite! amber M didnt do anything but dance and they had to start shi* with her because of that? they are straight pathetic! <br>  <br>  Team:Amber show!|`|9FztHceJaa	cookie more than likely or abitcy cookie is the only bad girl someone who never goes down without a fight|`|0UK5mRcQaa	I completely agree! Tiffany is such a bully now. I'm glad we got to see  get try colors though it only took like what two episodes? lol! Aliea is so mental and annoying the "fab five" are not fab at all they are all so immature it's pathetic! I would be happy if any of the fab five goes home the Ambers are the only ones worth watching. The Ambers try like everyday to aologize and be friends with them but their all so mean. Also the fab five talks about how close they are but if it wasn't for the Ambers they would have nothing in common or anything to talk about. Team Ambers!! lol also Sarah and Ashley both looked like fat manatees in the wet body contest. It was funny how like only Tiffany cheerred for them and everyone else was for the pretty girl.|`|Y3MMXpvRaa	This was BULL ****. It is definatley not right to gang up on one person for no good reason. They are all a bunch of big mouth bitches, but are all pansies cuz they cant fight their own fights. I love Amber M, Amber B is okay but too scared. Tiffany and Boston I can not stand!!! And Ashely I hate the way she is so big and awkward, and I hate the weird hair part :-(.|`|SSae4XQZaa	I searched it last night and it told who goes home now it is erased and it said whitney, aliyah, and cookie go home (cookie for being in previous fight too) sounds ridiculous for cookie to be kicked off but thats what it said so we will have to see how accurate it is next week.|`|9JYxTrnzaa	I am sooo mad! I just got to see this episode and i was in shock! I seriously want to beat alliyah the fu*k up!!!! All these chicks claim to be so "bad" why did it takes all of you hoes to the"damage" you did!!! Your all straight up wack!!! Cookie i got your back all day JERZEY BITCHES!!!!!!!!!|`|0e88269d9478a044362d898d8140306faa	boston AKA Whitchney look like a midget . i have never liked her since the beginning. Aliea just need to go. And Tiffany look like an over stuffed burritos. I did not like the Amber's but now i feel for them.<br>  <br>  The fat 5 got to go.<br>  <br>  this season is just lame|`|f1l9DT3Paa	I am so glad Ailea went home. Whitney deserved to go home as well. Ailea doesn't do anything but run her doggone mouth and I think someone needs to <br>  Edit: Beat Her ***|`|lA0GEx3caa	I actually watched it in slow motion and amber put her hand on whitney's neck first|`|qxUNmdd6aa	Hope Im Not A Spoiler But,<br>  Whitney And Ailea Go Homeeeee.<br>  <br>  i wish tiffany went home too aswell as Ashley\<br>  shitttt.|`|BqO5xKLkaa	I think that Whitney, Tiffany, and Ailea should GO TO JAIL. They all ganged up on Amber M and kinda beat her up. Those 3 b*tches think they're so tough and can get away with it. I hope they don't. They're stupid, and obsessed with hating the Ambers. It kinda grosses me out..|`|TiS89hj1aa	That fight was BS Whitney and Aliea are punks one Amber was drunk even though she was holding her own Was it really necessary to jump her???? They both talk so much ish it makes me sick.  I think they both should go home.  Tiffany had nothing to do with the fight and was only trying to break up the fight and get the shoe out of Ambers hand.  Not only should they get kicked off the show I think Amber should press charges against the two loud mouth punks.

Every Sunday morning he would take his 7-year old granddaughter out for a drive in the car for some bonding time. Just he and his granddaughter. <br>        One particular Sunday however, he had a bad cold and really didn't feel like being up at all. Luckily, his wife came to the rescue and said that she would take their granddaughter out. <br>         When they returned, the little girl anxiously ran upstairs to see her grandfather. 'Well, did you enjoy your ride with grandma?' 'Oh yes, PaPa' the girl replied, 'and do you know what? We didn't see a single dumb bastard or lousy **** head anywhere we went today!'  <br>  <br>  Brings a tear to your eye doesn't it. :|`|gbkBJltXaa	A bit crude but funny nonetheless.|`|a1gSZzoyaa	funny stuff

But he's just saying he needs her, and that he doesn't care that she hurts him, but he'll always love her because has a physical dependance on her.<br>  <br>  i think the whole song could be thought about as if written about a girlfriend/boyfriend even though it is written about max, and i think "i need your sway/cause you always pay for it" might refer to someone swaying either dancing or just falling drunk or on drugs, as that would explain why he/she paid for it and he could be saying he needs it because he's addicted or because it is a time when they don't argue and see their friends
ZzqWzFNiaa	The one that jumps to mind, though it may not be my favorite, it would certainly be up there on the topic.<br>  <br>  the Smiths - There Is A Light That Never Goes Out<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INgXzChwipY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INgXzChwi...</a><br>  <br>  I saw you mentioned Oingo Boingo earlier and remembering that brings to mind No One Lives Forever (great tune). Silly as even I think it is (I was young and it was not entirely my idea, long story) I have a tatoo involving that song.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eStq-IvLaXk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eStq-IvLa...</a><br>  -fun little video<br>  <br>  **************<br>  Hi Shades,<br>  It's not terribly interesting, just really wordy, but two friends of mine and I were probably 19 or so and we all decided to go and get a tat together. We had all been really tight since we were in at least second grade and we thought it would be cool to all get the same thing to sort of mark the fact that were all awesome buds and had done this together. So, the two of them were really big Oingo Boingo fans, I've always liked them, not necessarily a "fan" per say, but I'd always been really fond of them and they have those great scull designs which we figured would make a great tattoo design. So, we all got the skull smoking a cigarette from the inside cover of Boingo Alive (I think disk 1, but I could be mistaken, I haven't seen that cd cover in so many years) with No One Lives Forever written around it. At any rate, I always felt a little weird about it because it's not like I was a really big fan like they were (at least not really enough to warrant a tattoo in their honor), but it's more about the moment than the band for me (not really about the band at all aside from the conversation piece portion of it), but it is kind of weird to have a band tattoo for a band that at most I could say I like a lot. Like I said though, that's not the significance for me though. Great tune though, great band. <br>  <br>  To extend it even further (figure I've taken it this far), I find it slightly ironic that when you combine the two parts of the tattoo you end up with a song that I don't really care for. I like the Dead Man's Party version of No One Lives Forever a whole lot, one of my favorites from that record. Great tune, but I've never been fond of the Boingo Alive version. Just a weird little factoid from the world of me.<br>  <br>  ***************<br>  Thanks Shades. The one stain on it is that I had a falling out with one of them about 5 or 6 years ago and we haven't spoken since (not my choice, but it is what it is), but me and the other guy are still really tight. I do count myself as incredibly lucky in that I've been able to hold onto some really amazing friendships over a whole lot of years.|`|dcMq7juHaa	There are some great answers here: Queen, Dream Theater, Oingo Boingo, Blood Sweat and Tears!<br>  <br>  I think my favorite "dying" song is Bat Out of Hell, by Meatloaf<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2Ekho8nU9U&feature=PlayList&p=F0E3D63952649DD7&playnext=1&index=18" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2Ekho8nU...</a>  (lyrics on the video sidebar)<br>  <br>  Warren Zevon wrote and recorded some very poignant songs about facing death towards the end of his life, like Keep Me in Your Heart <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7NQjLZvw44&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7NQjLZvw...</a><br>  <br>  but I prefer the rollicking irony of I'll Sleep When I'm Dead from his first album.

I was about six years old.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwv-DxOPhSc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwv-DxOPh...</a><br>  <br>  The only way that song has changed for me is that I know now we all, at all times, live in the autumn of the year. <br>  <br>  And here are two more which have great meaning to me. The first one is a beautiful song, but there's one particular line, other than the last one, which really strikes a chord with me:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XVVZPefbR4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XVVZPefb...</a><br>  <br>  "Let me bid you farewell, every man has to die..."<br>  <br>  And this second one, which contains in it a thought I have always believed in, that there is a light which never goes out:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INgXzChwipY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INgXzChwi...</a><br>  <br>  Finally, I once heard someone, at an open mic night, play and sing their own composition of one of my all-time favorite sonnets. I wish there was a recording of it, but unless one of his friends was taping something that night, I doubt there is:<br>  <br>  DEATH be not proud, though some have called thee   <br>  Mighty and dreadful, thou art not so,   <br>  For those whom thou think'st thou dost overthrow,   <br>  Die not, poor death, nor yet canst thou kill me.   <br>  From rest and sleep, which but thy pictures be,           <br>  Much pleasure, then from thee, much more must flow,   <br>  And soonest our best men with thee do go,   <br>  Rest of their bones, and souls delivery.   <br>  Thou art slave to fate, chance, kings, and desperate men,   <br>  And dost with poison, war, and sickness dwell,    <br>  And poppies, or charms can make us sleep as well,   <br>  And better than thy stroke; why swell'st thou then;   <br>  One short sleep past, we wake eternally,   <br>  And death shall be no more; death, thou shalt die.  <br>  <br>  ~John Donne, "Death, Be Not Proud"<br>  <br>  It was sung slowly, and he said he made up the melody. I think it's quite possible that we were the only two people in the room who knew the source, because when I spoke to him afterward, he said I seemed to be the only one who knew what he was doing (and also that my mouthing the words along with him gave me away). I wish someone else would make a song out of it--it's in the public domain, for hell's sake!<br>  <br>  (P.S. Sorry if there are typos in the sonnet. I typed it out, mostly from memory, only peeking a few times at my text. I know the words are right, and in the right order, but I may have skipped some of the punctuation, and having typed it, I cannot seem to see typos.)|`|59964d53fa7967029226eb0cf3c34609aa	I can hear David Clayton Thomas singing now...join in with Blood, Sweat and Tears, and follow the bouncing ball....<br>  <br>  ...Don't wanna go by the Devil,<br>  Don't wanna go by the Demon<br>  Don't wanna go by Satan,<br>  Don't wanna die undeasy,<br>  Just let me go naturally........<br>  <br>  ........And when I die, and when I'm dead,Dead and gone<br>  There'll be one child born, in this world to carry on, <br>  To carry on..........<br>  <br>  I'm going to click it up right now.|`|DnWsMhwLaa	donovan- there is a mountain<br>  <br>  great song, being aware of your own mortality doesn't have to be a sad thing- it can be a happy moment on the way to enlightenment.|`|1ViGcF3xaa	Hi Shades!<br>  <br>  You'll love this link<br>  Live for Today - Grass Roots<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnFZsrs32Co" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnFZsrs32...</a><br>  <br>  I love Durante when he says "they don't have a manager, they have a gardener!"|`|4KtPFzz5aa	Eleanor Rigby <a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/b/beatles/eleanor+rigby_10026674.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lyricsfreak.com/b/beatles/ele...</a>|`|qThmcR1Aaa	"Time Stand Still" by Rush<br>  "Who Wants to Live Forever" by Queen<br>  "A Change of Seasons" by Dream Theater<br>  "In My Life" by the Beatles|`|M2Cx9uqzaa	johnny cash - hurt (cover)<br>  <br>  originally by the nine inch nails, but the johnny cash version is better<br>  <br>  I hurt myself today,<br>  to see if i still feel,<br>  I focus on the pain,<br>  the only thing thats real,<br>  <br>  The needle tears a hole,<br>  the old familiar sting,<br>  try to kill it all away,<br>  but I remember everything,<br>  <br>  (Chorus)<br>  what have I become,<br>  my sweetest friend,<br>  everyone i know,<br>  goes away in the end,<br>  <br>  and you could have it all,<br>  my empire of dirt,<br>  I will let you down,<br>  I will make you hurt,<br>  <br>  I wear this crown of thorns,<br>  upon my liars chair,<br>  full of broken thoughts,<br>  I cannot repair,<br>  <br>  beneath the stains of time,<br>  the feelings dissapear,<br>  you are someone else,<br>  I am still right here,<br>  <br>  What have I become,<br>  my sweetest friend,<br>  everyone I know,<br>  goes away in the end,<br>  <br>  and you could have it all,<br>  my empire of dirt,<br>  I will let you down,<br>  I will make you hurt,<br>  <br>  if I could start again,<br>  a million miles away,<br>  I will keep myself,<br>  I would find a way,|`|dFacbjIZaa	Pachendale - Iron Maiden<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c20-fm_WNew1916" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c20-fm_WN...</a> - Motorhead<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFoqtpUFY8See" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqFoqtpUF...</a> You On The Other Side - Ozzy<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_CQcrwgFyw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_CQcrwgF...</a><br>  Dust In The Wind - Kansas<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkbdP7sq0w8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkbdP7sq0...</a><br>  <br>  There's Your links Shades, Happy Wednesday!<br>  Co Faves|`|ld1vh7nHaa	box of rain by the grateful dead...that's what it is about to me, lately anyway. <br>  you have the album so you don't need a link. and shame on you if you don't.<br>  <br>  he's gone by the dead is a good one...you should have europe 72, try that.|`|d02c709e184c7a1f7828d9e3e00c32b4aa	Now THIS question is pretty effing Goth.

The lyrics were childish, and the fact that it has stood the test of time boggles my mind.  They were not the first punk band, they just made it more known.

They didn't even get to release the first British Punk single ~ The Damned beat them to it with the superiour 'New Rose'. <br>  In fact, The Sex Pistols were a forerunner of all the more recent manufactured bands, since they were a 'product' of Malcolm Mclaren and Vivienne Westwood...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  NP : 'Bolero' ~ Ravel {New Philharmonia Orchestra}|`|12QJ9QMRaa	well, since most MEtal Core and Death Core bnands will be as remembered asd the NKOTB in about 10 years I don't have to focus on them...........<br>  <br>  Perse Beat Me to AC/DC....

If someone doesn't fancy me for me then that's that. I wouldn't try to out do someone else. I'd like someone to fancy me because of how I am normally, not because I was competing with someone. If that person couldnt make their mind up I'd say they were never that interested and move on. Plenty more fish in the sea.|`|LrYCJq5yaa	`fraid not....i only seem to lose out.  <br>  not competing saves the pain of rejection.      and not to mention the embarrassment of being seen as "stupid" , ay?|`|rjsfiWt9aa	If i have to compete then he obviously dosnt think much of me, and hes not with it.<br>  <br>  Unless it was some contest to win a date with some celebrity or something like that, haha that would be fun!|`|85e523768f9d3de593f887a99703df6caa	You mean like, if me and another girl liked the same guy, would I go out of my way to try and get him to like me more than her?

Leaving children at the age of 2,3,and 4 home alone for more than a few minutes anything could happen.  That is pure neglect.  I don't believe the laws are strict enough anywhere in the United States for this type of behavior.  Where I live, a very small town, she would be strung up by the town marshal (yes, I said town marshal) we don't have a large police station or even a jail, the town is so small.  Our town is from the old school so she would definitely be in big time trouble here. We don't have much crime in our little town (things like jay walking maybe).  If anything bad happened they would be transferred to next big city which would be Ft Wayne, Indiana, I live in Churubusco, In.  Women that can't take care of their children and be responsible shouldn't have them.  There is absolutely no excuse for leaving them alone at that age for any length of time.|`|ZzyEhSB1aa	I'm in the South East of England.<br>  <br>  My next door neighbour did exactly the same thing but it could have been fatal.<br>  She has 3 children 8yrs, 4yrs and 2 (very young) <br>  When she moved in, I introduced myself to her and her family just to say hi, but she was very distant.<br>  She broke up with her partner and was left to look after the 3 children on her own.  She then began to leave the the children at home alone on occasions.<br>  I had a word with her and told her that I was aware of it and I told her if she really needs help, she can leave the children with me and they can play with mine - she was still very distant and continued to leave the children on their own.<br>  One Friday evening, I could smell burning next door - my neighbour had left the children on their own, they got hungry and decided to cook something. <br>  To cut a long story short, the children had caused a major fire in the kitchen, they managed to get out safely with the help of me and the other neighbours. The mother was arrested and the children were put into social services.<br>  When the police released her - I had a good word with her about what had happened. The children were eventually reunited with their mother after social services could see that she had changed as a mother and that the home was a suitable place.<br>  The happy side of all of this - she has reunited with the children's father and they are living as a family. When my neighbour needed to go out, she would leave her children with me.<br>  They have now moved into a bigger home and we are still in touch.<br>  <br>  These stories are real and they do occur. This incident has a happy ending, many don't|`|sxahupRTaa	Not sure what the law is in Oklahoma but this is a shameful act of neglect. What disturbs me more is that this person was allowed to have 3 children so close togther in age when she clearly should not be having children at all. She needs social services assistance and yes she should face neglect charges. As a father of a 5 year old boy I can't imagine doing what she did....|`|WrZsRICCaa	I don't think people should be arrested for leaving their kids home as that would be playing into their hands by taking said annoying kids away. Best thing to do is make the Parents stay all day in an airport with the children - that would be the worst punishment.|`|rj004nrlaa	yes that's neglect and the children should be protected. They are way too young to be home alone.<br>  <br>  The law in my area would be they were taken by social services and it would be investigated.<br>  <br>  UK.|`|veXsp7v1aa	Yes, thats why I make my kids fake sick when I want to go out. i just drop em at the ER and come back 5-6 hours later. They're usually right in the same sopt I left them.|`|7iwVX51saa	My opinion-  The story is probably half made up to sell newspapers.
ZdpaUoteaa	sorry, I drive a an Audi..........|`|AA10181139	Anyone answering this question would need to see the whole chart to give you any meaningful kind of explanation.<br>  <br>  Mercury is the planet of communication, but it also takes on some of the qualities of any planet or point it comes into contact with. Mercury square a Gemini ascendant ( Mercury RULES Gemini) would have a different explanation from Mercury squaring a Leo ascendant ( Sun -ruled).<br>  <br>  Mercury transits are fast-moving and not usually that strongly noticeable - squares are generally stumbling blocks but they can energise a situation.<br>  <br>  A retrograde Mercury aspecting an Aries ascendant might delay a letter or package, but the Aries response might be exasperation and a move to complain, or the Aries person might say, " Forget it" and move on to a new enterprise during a Mercury square.<br>  <br>  Finally the Mercury position by house  for a square transit could be from the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 9th, 10th or eleventh houses - each would give a different emphasis. 3rd might just be missing a bus, 9th a failure in an examination or test.|`|448d8047868dad85a78f45806967142eaa	it doesnt help, but my initials are ASC :)
J1kJb98Maa	netflix told you they would not be available any time soon (" very long wait")<br>  so you decided to move them to the top of your list? ummmm do you not understand how netflix works? sigh<br>  go talk to kelly lapour she will explain it to ya<br>  edited to add<br>  i do not agree that netflix is a "ripoff"<br>  i was on the three movies at a time and unlimited off the web program<br>  i would on the average get 18 movies a month and that of course does not include the ones i watched off their website.<br>  my local video store ( which is at least a 20 minute drive ) does not offer " a dollar shelf "<br>  my mail comes at 930 am i would get three movies/tv series i would watch one or two that day and throw them back in the mail the same day before the post office closed at 4 pm <br>  ( post office four minute drive )<br>  now after about five months of this i did notice that netflix slowed down delivery to me alottttttttttttttttttttt ( some call this throtling )so i canceled it after seven months ...but it was well worth it for me ...but you cant let them sit around your house you have to get them back in the mail asap<br>  it helps that i do not have tv so i was more inclined to make sure i got my netflix back in the mail asap|`|uPVnqbE8aa	The way Netflix works is that the next "available" movie on your list will be sent to you "regardless" of the order you have your priorities in.  Your list is only a guide for them to understand the ones you want first, but they work their way down that list and grab the next available one, then the next, and the next.<br>  By the way, you should know, Netflix is a rip-off.  You would be far better renting off the dollar shelf of your local video store than with them.  If you calculate the time lost in shipping to and from Netflix to you and then back again, it can cost you anywhere from $3.oo to $5.oo per movie or more.  They are making a killing and it's costing you more than at your local store.  You see,  you are paying a "flat rate" per month, which is the "time" you are with them, rather than for each movie.  In other words, if you rent a maximum of 4 movies per month and are paying $10.oo per month, and it takes 6 weeks to get and return all 4 movies, then you are paying $3.75 per movie to rent it.  They have no late fees because the longer you keep the movie the more it costs you.  The choice is yours.

The right to a free press is what protects the photographer from repercussions. I'm not exactly sure who sets the bar as to what is too risque or not. It all boils down to what is legal and what is not. These guys use poor judgment when posting such pictures, but their judgment is diluted by dollar signs.<br>  <br>  Edit: Yeah, I see what you mean.

For example, simply pressing "A" will type the letter a, but if you hold down either Alt key while pressing A, the computer will perform an "Alt-A" function.|`|xNC1JoPsaa	It stands for "ALTernate" key|`|4Yk53Ly3aa	Good question, I have no clue either...|`|310i8CKZaa	Alternate|`|3FFAIMpLaa	Alternate as in alternate function.
AA10954273	There are only three episodes left, but the final episode will reportedly be up to three hours.  That's plenty of time to wrap things up.  We know that Cavil has a plan that involves Hera, probably because she's the only human/Cylon hybrid (that we know of).  We know Daniel may or may not still be alive.  There's the mystery of what Starbuck is.  They're obviously building toward something.  At this point I hesitate to speculate, but I think they'll wrap it up pretty well.|`|71dc8b0b34bc9146e70f8ed00ac5dfdbaa	I think Starbuck is a human / Cylon hybrid. Her father is the key to the ending. The hybrid than ran the Cylon ship told Kara that she would lead to the end of the human race. She could have meant that Cylons and Humans will fully breed and in the future there will be neither.|`|AA10744842	i do not really like the new battlestar galactica - bad story lines,hun.|`|B5xrYsuxaa	i think the piano player could be daniel and he was starbucks dad OR daniel's consciousness was downloaded into another body and he is now starbuck...<br>  <br>  my main thing is, when anders got shot and started remembering the past (ie: about the final five on Earth) he said that after Earth was destroyed the final five got into a ship, entered a stasis chamber and a couple thousand years later ended up at the twelve colonies only to discover that the humans were at war with the cylons..Anders also said he and the rest of the final five help broker a peace deal that would end the war, the cylons would cease their hostilities in return for the 7 skin job models...ok nice...my problem is, if Adama and Tigh fought together during the first cylon war, how was Tigh already at the 12 colonies before the final five arrived to broker the peace deal?? its a paradox, unless more than one copy of him escaped from earth before it was nuked...OR the final five arrived at earth like ten years before they brokered the truce and thats how Tigh and Adama knew each other back then...im confused lol|`|dYYU2gsKaa	I personally expect Daniel to be "resurrected" in the body of Anders, when he eventually comes around - but I'm usually wrong - and Starbuck must have resurrected somewhere (presumably in some hidden location  -  i.e. the last refuge of the survivors of Earth).  <br>  <br>  If Daniel, then, was Starbuck's father, making her a hybrid, I guess this was enough to allow her to resurrect using the earth-survivors technology (assuming they exist).  <br>  <br>  The idea that a piano, virtually identical to those on (our) earth, could have been invented in the colonies is pushing credibility a bit too far though :)  <br>  <br>  (and if I'm right Starbuck could end up married to her father so you might want to scratch the first bit!)|`|de29070765c097b8f505a737e52df5bfaa	It is science fiction.

They should NOT be showing at 3:30. Exactly when kids are getting home from school!<br>  Here in the U.S. They have a rating system.

RDoVxcgmaa	I know EXACTLY what you mean. Many tabs are not transcribed by the artists themselves. You'll more often than not see "transcribed by...." and it won't be the actual artist. A perfect example was "Walk" by Pantera transcribed as a series of hammer ons for open,1st fret ,2nd fret. The tuning wasn't even correct .Later I got the book where it was transcribed by DIME himself and he actually gave examples of "the wrong way" and the "right way".It's actually open string then 1/2 step bends on the first fret,HUGE difference in sound!!<br>    Unless it's transcribed by the musician it's the transcribers "best guess' as to what the actual notes are. Tabs are a good ball park guide to a tune,but as you found out can leave room for guess work.It's more or less the transcribers interp. of the song. Hope this helps ya..you're not alone !!|`|ysUqQ9Qkaa	You're totally right.  A lot of tabs are flat out wrong to just a little bit wrong.  Tabs are submitted by people who work the songs out by ear, so it depends on how good the person working out the tab is.  Many times tabs are wrong, for example, because they transpose the songs into different keys than it was originally written in.  Then when you play the song it doesn't sound quite right even if it's been transposed correctly because it's still off by whatever the change in the fundamental was.  <br>  <br>  Secondly, I find that a lot of players have a hard time distinguishing between different guitar techniques.  IE. Tab might show a slide up to a certain note, but in the actual song it's a hammer-on.  Little differences like that can change how a song sounds somewhat drastically in some cases.  <br>  <br>  Thirdly, some people simplify the songs to leave out complicated arrangements and techniques while still retaining the core melody of a song.  Sort of  like those "Giant Fake Books" that they have for piano.<br>  <br>  And finally, some stuff is just really hard to write out in tab format.  For example Tom Morello lines get played sometimes by him pressing the instrument cable onto the vibrating strings, or Jimi Page playing with a bow.  There exists no methodology to describe these kinds of events in traditional tab, so some songs aren't even possible to have tab of.|`|4IsbWDNSaa	I can't seem to get your point, sorry.<br>  <br>  I'm a guitarist too. <br>  <br>  If you're talking about losing an interest on a song once you've already played it, i guess you have a point there.|`|ofFGEv9Laa	well u can use guitar pro<br>  then u can hear the tabs.|`|01560ec0c698f8c7ff3f39e65adafb92aa	Because anyone can put tabs up on the internet, even those who have been playing guitar for less than a week.<br>  <br>       There are only certain individuals with the experience and know how to properly tab performances.<br>  <br>       Once you find a tab that you believe is very accurate, it helps to remember that particular name, and search for other tabs by that same individual.<br>  <br>       I was fortunate to start guitar before the invention of tabs, and I had to sit down with a song and laborously figure out the chord changes, and from there...procede to grab a handle on any solo work.<br>  <br>       It made for a better well rounded education.  If your ear cannot discern the difference between say an F chord and a Dm then you should not  be tabbing out songs.<br>  <br>       Plus on solo, lead guitar work...if you cannot tell whether the guitarist is playing a note on the 3rd string, or the 2nd string...you should never tab a song.

I might be going to London at the weekend to visit him outside his hotel, that would be amazing!!<br>  I kinda agree with you, how he should let every fan have a chance of seeing him live, i dont have to worry about that cus i live in England, bu i totally understand your point, but then again he said he wanted to start in London because he feels that the other countries havent forgotten about the child molestation trails, and they still harrass him about it, but he said he feels more welcome in england. I am kinda relieved he is coming to my country because if he had o went to another, i would have sat ripping my hair out because of the fact that he would have been doing a comeback and i cant even see him!!!<br>  <br>  Love you loads x|`|IHUS8wsbaa	I personally think michael jackson should do a world tour. and i agree it is unfair to fans world wide.

He is doing what he thinks he can handle and is doing this to "feel out" his fans and I am sure that if this works he will do more tours.  MJ misses his fans as much as we miss him.<br>  Peace, Love & Happiness|`|e5Uk9jNTaa	It's better for him and the fans to do a world tour|`|nANmDzedaa	Who is MICHAEEEEELLLL?

076b9d27ad5d5f819b3da4ba342506eaaa	Keith Richards- The first blues-influenced rocker to make the modern day rock scene begin. He was the first guitarist to show off drugs, sex and rock and roll.<br>  <br>  Jimi Hendrix- The first shredder. Really no explanation needed. He left this world far too soon.<br>  <br>  Tony Iommi- One of the fathers of metal. This man did many things to helping metal get started.<br>  <br>  Jimmy Page- Again, really no explanation needed. Led Zeppelin.<br>  <br>  Eddie Van Halen- This one may need some explaining. EVH changed the guitar world upside down when he burst onto the scene in the late 70's. The most renown two hand tapper, considered one of the best soloists, and personally, my favorite guitarist. I give credit where credit is due.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: Thanks for this question. This answer just took me up to level 6. Yes.|`|hZegT1raaa	1. eric clapton- if you take into account the fact that he is a master on the acoustic as well as the electric, i don't think there's any comparison...no one else can be deemed a master of both media except clapton<br>  <br>  2. jimi hendrix- the most revolutionary guitarist ever, he changed the way the instrument was played even in the present day...no one has influenced the playing of the instrument more<br>  <br>  3. jimmy page- the greatest guitarist of the greatest musical generation from the area of the world that produced the greatest music<br>  <br>  4. eddie van halen- he was just so naturally gifted, and versatile as well...eruption is all the proof you need to put him on this list<br>  <br>  5. slash- he wrote some of the most memorable pieces of all time and wasn't too bad at playing them either...i don't think he was exactly a standout guitarist but his writing is second to none|`|RVAPQg6Waa	5. Adrian Belew - Imagination and chops for miles, every time I listen to his playing it screws off my head and plops it down on at a different angle... so very left field...<br>  <br>  4. Randy Rhodes - Neo-Classical metal chops and a tone that perfect, it always seemed that he never overplayed, even thought he could have stuffed more in, he had the class and verve to know what was right for the song...<br>  <br>  3. Django Reinhart - Gypsy Jazz genius who through an accident was left with only two fingers on his fretting hand.  Still his style is imitated to this day, swung harder than anyone...<br>  <br>  2. Michael Schenker - Temperamental and hot headed but has the amazing ability to translate it to his playing. originated the lead tone and phrasing Slash would later sell millions of records with....<br>  <br>  1. Richard Thompson - Rock, Jazz, Blues and Traditional Celtic playing thrown through a wood chipper of pure chops, doesn't need volume or effects to sound amazing. Though he's a chop monster his playing is never superfluous to the song....|`|1ViGcF3xaa	Gary Moore - Best Blues guitarist in my mind.  His playing has so much soul he brings tears to my eyes.  <br>  Alvin Lee - Favorite one to watch for rock and blues music.  His fingers move the quickest I've ever seen.<br>  Jimi Hendrix - The pioneer of metal/psychedelia guitar and plays some mean rock & blues too.<br>  Jeff Beck - He can play any type of music on guitar, Blues, Rock, Jazz, Electronica, Metal, Fusion, Swing, Etc.  He's the guitar virtuoso.<br>  Rod "The Bottle" Price - Best slide guitarist I ever heard.  You probably won't see his name on anyone else's list, Lol.|`|RcCJSSMPaa	1. Stevie Ray Vaughan...his guitar SPEAKS to my soul<br>  2. Jimi Hendrix...the guy who set the precendent<br>  3. Mike Bloomfield...amazing<br>  4. Peter Townshend...Anarchy in a guitar<br>  5. David Gilmour...genius<br>  6. Ritchie Blackmore...his riffs HAUNT me<br>  <br>  Sorry, I couldn't stop at five (A.D.D. don't follow directions too well!)  Runners up:  Slash, Carlos Santana, Angus Young, The Edge, Duane Allman<br>  <br>  Great question!|`|4e11GJVZaa	5. Jimi Hendrix<br>  The guy invented a sound and soul that evolved as the modern rock we hear today. This guy pushed the limits of what rock music was. We owe a lot more than kids today realize to Jimi.<br>  <br>  4. Slash<br>  I don't have much of a reason, besides he has wrote some amazing songs and he is one of the few guitarists who have invented their own "style". His fusion of blues rock in metal was a great idea and sounds great.<br>  <br>  3. Paul Gilbert<br>  My first instructional dvd for guitar featured Paul Gilbert. This was the first time I ever saw anyone shred a guitar. It was mesmerizing. His neo-classical virtuoso skills are very obvious and inspired me to want to be a shredder myself.<br>  <br>  2. Kirk Hammett<br>  Kirk had a unique style of leads that helped separate him from other players of his time. As drummer Lars Ulrich put it "It was glad to hear an American guy who DIDN'T sound like Eddie Van Halen". He had a great melodic style and had the speed to match James Hetfield's quick thrashing.<br>  <br>  1. Michael Angelo Batio<br>  This guy is a legend in my book. He is a decent shredder in his own respect. He has a great melodic style, but that is not what makes him so great. In fact, he may be much further down on the list, if he wasn't the only man to wield a DOUBLE GUITAR. He can play legato on two guitars simultaneously, while harmonizing the leads so he is not playing the same thing on both guitars. His ambidexterity alone is an amazing feat, but his overall incredible dexterity and flashy stage moves make him a marvel among lesser guitar wielders.|`|YMkj2QtVaa	1. Slash- everyone thinks that everybody likes him, but he is an excellent blues guitarist<br>  2. Synyster Gates- This is just a personal favorite but his solo in afterlife is the best ive heard of this decade (besides slither- go slash!<br>  3. Nuno Bettancourt- Just listen to Play With Me- Extreme<br>  4. Van Halen- His songs might not be as complex as others, but the defiantly sound great<br>  5. Randy Rhoads- He strummed every note in the crazy train solo|`|76d0f42b082dd7b4403317013a48817eaa	Lil Wayne<br>  CC Deville<br>  Elton John<br>  Robert Plant<br>  Me<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Seriously,<br>  <br>  Stevie Ray Vaughan - Texas blues at its best.<br>  <br>  Eric Johnson - Some of the cleanest sounds I have ever heard coming out of an electric guitar<br>  <br>  Alex Skolnick - Great thrash and jazz guitarist<br>  <br>  Jake E. Lee - Good wit Ozzy, but great in Badlands<br>  <br>  Jimi Hendrix - Not a technical as the first four, but influenced every one.|`|i5YJBqnZaa	Jeff Beck: A Genius with a guitar. The man had guitars crying and wailing long before anyone knew it could be done.  <br>  <br>  Jimi Hendrix: There isn't a thing I could say about him that hasn't already been said.<br>  <br>  Stevie Ray Vaughan: Pure Blues guitar playing at it's best.<br>  <br>  Carlos Santana: So smooth and so sweet. And no one sounds like him. You know his playing within a couple notes.<br>  <br>  Liona Boyd: Classical guitarist extraordinaire|`|qaAW9VN4aa	Sooo many...Jimi Hendrix:why?why not?he was Jimi   Tommy Bolin:was like a butterfly playin a guitar  Slash:the bluesy stuff like "You're Crazy" and "One in a million" unbeatable! Collins/Rossington/Gaines figure that one out...Keith Richards,Joe Walsh,Eddie VH,Terrible Ted , Santana,Jimmy Page,Eric Clapton, Alvin Lee, and I know there's 50 more probably but I got stuff to do.Oh !  and me...|`|uUDNcsyUaa	Joe Satriani - needs no explanation<br>  <br>  Tom Morello - one of the best 'riff' writers ever, incredibly innovative with his techniques and use of effects<br>  <br>  SRV - no one can play the blues like this man<br>  <br>  Dimebag - best metal guitar player ever IMO<br>  <br>  Don Ross - probably the most incredible acoustic guitar player in the world...amazing songwriter<br>  <br>  <br>  There many others who are equally my favorites but these are the first ones that came to mind that are all very different|`|lgMshdofaa	My list is not going to be like anybody elses!<br>  <br>  NUMBER ONE! MATT WINGFIELD: He is so awesome! search him up on youtube, he has all original songs and they are so sweet!<br>  <br>  NUMBER TWO! SUNGHA JUNG: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/jwcfree" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/jwcfree</a><br>  <br>  Number three! Daniel Carson: You can give him three notes and he can create an amazing solo!!<br>  <br>  Number four! Ed Cash: he is  a producer who can play almost any instrument.<br>  <br>  I have a tie for the fifth:<br>  JON NEUFELD<br>  CHRIS TOMLIN|`|71SjVwWNaa	Jimi Hendrix - his style, the way he innovated new guitar techniques, just all around an exceptional guitar player in my opinion. <br>  <br>  Eric Clapton - one of the smoothest guitar players IMO, I play acoustic guitar and if i could be as smooth as him i would die a happy man, the way his fingers walk up and down the neck of the guitar is ridiculous <br>  <br>  Duane Allman - he was such a natural at guitar, whether its slide, electric or acoustic Duane could play it and play it well,<br>  <br>  Robert Johnson - I consider him grandfather of rock and roll, his guitar playing has influenced generations of musicians to the likes of muddy waters, Clapton, Hendrix, and even Dylan...without him pretty much my list of favorite guitarists is blank<br>  <br>  Jimmy Page -  he is one of the most versatile, influential and important guitarists in rock and roll history. Plus Led Zeppelin is one of my all time favorite bands so i'm kinda biased toward Page
5uvTte8Zaa	Good night.<br>  <br>  I have Abigail and Them and I can't tell which one I like better sometimes.<br>  Probably Them with all the hooks and chord changes being so plentiful.<br>  Welcome Home does something to me.

I was born in 1984, I grew up with Jean-Claude's movies, their great and bring back so many cherished childhood memories.

Michael Mann does action movies like no one else, stylish, smart and memorable.

Sarah got hold of Ailea and held her. Tiff  got Whitney off of Amber M, but then Amber M got in Tiff's face and hit her and Tiff went nuts! If you watch it, Amber M actually hit Tiff first, maybe because she was so drunk and didnt know who was attacking her.|`|cV17eVCYaa	I really cannot stand that damn Ailea and Whitney!

FE96lTPLaa	There is no Kal sarp yoga in your horoscope.. All planets except Venus are placed on one side of Rahu and Ketu. As Venus is on the other side. Thus Kal Sarp Yoga is not formed.<br>  You are under the influence of Rahu Dasa since August 2000. Rahu is placed in the 9th house with Venus. Rahu pooja should be got done.|`|PGeAFKYZaa	The given data indicates Vrischik lagnam, Kanya Rashi, Manglik Yogam, Kalsarp yogam a variant/reverse and current Vimsotari dasa of Rahu. Foreign travel is indicated. From astrology point of view it is quite important to have a horoscope matched for marital relationships. it is absolutely necessary to be deeply honest, of good character and conduct and never be with bad company and bad habits including no smoking, alcohol, drugs, bad company and extramarital affairs. As long you are focused on your education and career with persistent efforts you can rise very high in life. Always be very kind to every body especially to your parents, subordinates, poor, disabled, sick and elderly people. Fasting on Tuesdays, visiting Bangla Sahib Gurudwara, to learn and acquire true spirituality with a positive change in outlook and doing service of shoes and reciting Sukhmani Sahib on regular basis is going to be helpful in all walks of life and progress. Absolutely no fish better to have a vegetarian life style. You will be able to see the results for yourself as long they are done with humility and purity of heart. Please use your own discretion, these thoughts are given in good faith.|`|ripG5kr5aa	You have partial (Ardha) Kalsarp Yoga in your Kundali (birthchart)<br>  Kalsarp Yoga is a dreaded planetary combination formed when all the prime planets (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Mars, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn) fall between Rahu & Ketu in the Janma kundali. <br>  <br>  Kalsarp Yoga is said to apply ONLY if ALL the planets are between Rahu and Ketu, if any single planet is outside this region then the Kalsarpa Yoga is cancelled. However a small school of astrologers believes that if only one planet is outside the region of Rahu and Ketu then the person has Ardha or Partial Kalsarp yoga. The impact of the Partial Kalsarpa Yoga however may not be as pronounced as the full Kalsarpa Yoga. <br>  <br>  There will be challenges in your life. Maybe a few more than those that a person who doesn’t have Kalsarp faces, but not so many that you cannot fight. Brave your challenges with tenacity because Kalsarp also gives you inner strength. If you are true to your convictions and struggle with a pure and a determined heart then Kalsarp cannot deter you. <br>  <br>  If there are other favorable combinations in your chart, then the effect of this Yoga will be even more subdued. Remember there are many successful people with full or partial Kalsarp yoga in their charts, so there’s no need to panic.<br>  <br>  Your Kalsarp Yoga Type: SHANKHNAAD<br>  The Shanknaad/Shankhchood Kalsarp Yoga forms when Rahu is in the 9th house of the birthchart and Ketu is in the 3rd house. You may face many upheavals in your life. There will be sudden success, and sudden failures. If you keep working hard, the success will be more than failures and you will climb shakily, but steadily. <br>  <br>  Keep a check on your temper and try to avoid falsehood as it may create even more problems for you. <br>  <br>  Remember, the Kalsarp yoga is not the only combination in your chart. If you have other positive combinations (yogas), there will have a positive impact and the negative effects of the Kalsarp yoga will be limited.<br>  Kalsarp Yoga Remedies<br>  - Worship the Rudra avatar of lord Shiva. <br>  - Wear Gomed and Cat’s eye gemstones. <br>  - Wear a kalsarpa ring. Shaped like a snake.|`|Zyg3trcyaa	091080 1205 Delhi<br>  <a href="https://docs.google.com/Doc?id=d2vnvq8_5141hgmv4rdt" rel="nofollow">https://docs.google.com/Doc?id=d2vnvq8_5...</a><br>  Though u hv Kaal Sarp Dosha but since u r budha elevated so it ll not effect u.

caLPjFI7aa	only way to look for a pro bass tab of that is to get a program called tablature and looking around on google for it.  Google is a useful tool to find things like that you just have to word it properly to get what you need. Most music sheets are all over the internet.

If you had a cd I would buy it.|`|ptzm6nboaa	I'd give it about a 5. Is this the first song you've written? One of the first? Considering that (I assume) this is amateur work - not a bad thing, I'm not insulting - it's okay.<br>  I don't like giving specific examples of "you should change _______ to _______," because I don't like dictating another's work. But it seems all jumbled up and doesn't make a whole lot of sense. I think I get the main point of the song, but certain parts are just, like, "What???" They're confusing. I like that you leave room for interpretation, but the structure and wording need a bit of work. <br>  I've written quite a few songs myself, so I do know what I'm talking about. If you'd like more advice, feel free to email me. <br>  I hope I helped! =]

However, she will go through. She reminds me of Fantasia too much.<br>  <br>  But, last night was so dissapointing. They did not do very well. The only 2 I was impressed with was Jorge and Scott.

T9fxCu50aa	There are three ways that the position of planets are measured.  One is celestial longitude.  This the best known.  The position is measured along the ecliptic (the apparent path of the Sun going around the earth - yes I know it's the other way around), and it is expressed like this. Mars is at 23 Gemini 22. Planets (except the Sun by definition) are not often exactly on this path.  They are above and below it. This is called celestial latitude.  Finally planets' positions can also be measured with reference to the celestial equator, which is the earth's equator projected outwards. This is called declination.<br>  <br>  The ecliptic is at about a 23 degree angle to the equator.  When a planet is beyond 23 degrees of declination, it is considered out of bounds.<br>  <br>  For a more detailed and an explanation of the various meanings try this site: <a href="http://www.mandala.be/declination/pamela.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mandala.be/declination/pamela...</a> Personally, I'm not so sure this is all that important, but others might.

MxCvZAVRaa	You need to raise the action on the e string, it's hitting the fourth fret (giving you an A-flat/G# note) because the string is sitting too close to the fretboard.|`|ce83aaa18b48dd89e8f2ce5b7f9d7885aa	I wouldn't worry about it just being old. Most guitars get better with age. But a couple of questions for you. Is this something new? Did you just change strings? Could be as simple a a neck or bridge adjustment. If you are uncomfortable doing it, take it to a shop. Someone there can tell you what it is in a couple of minutes. Probably a real cheap fix|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	Check for worn frets.  Put a capo between the fourth and fifth frets and see if the string clears frets one, two and three.  If so you need to have work done.  Frets are made of a soft alloy, usually "German Silver" which is actually a solder-like bronze, and do wear with use.  Otherwise you have either neck or nut issues.  See a qualified guitar tech or luthier.  A truss rod misadjustment would not cause this problem and I can not think of any problem that is easily fixed that would.|`|37evQRaDaa	I'm guessing that your E strings plays an E until you try to fret it, and then it plays A flat.  The suggests that either the first 3 frets are low or the 4th fret is high.  Most likely the first 3 frets are worn down so far that when you try to fret them, it actually frets the string at the 4th fret instead.  Sometimes you can file all the frets to the same height.  Otherwise you're looking at refretting the guitar.|`|flU2gf54aa	Make sure the string has a good seat

ZbQ5ucODaa	Everyone I know has been talking about this.<br>  <br>  I am disgusted with the show, lame Chris Harrison the host, and ABC.  I will not be watching any other Bachelor or Bachelorette.  I only would have watched if it was Melissa; however, I do understand its too soon for her.  I didn't care about stupid hot dog Canadian Jillian and am not going to get sucked into all the drama (whether real or staged) again.  The way they strung us all along all season with the Deanna clips only to find it was on the last episode was lame too.<br>  <br>  This season went below the belt and didn't have to be handled the way it was.  Jason did not need to break up with Melissa live on the air, they could have done it behind the scenes and then "updated" america together on the show.  That was beyond tacky - it was cruel.  And the fact that there was a child involved was shameful.<br>  <br>  No more! That seems to be what the majority of my coworkers, family and friends are saying as well.  Chris Harrison look for a new job!!|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	I don't know if I will watch it again or not. I'm kinda undecided on that. <br>  <br>  I don't think Melissa would have accepted the invitation to become the next bachelorette. She refused to even show up for the taping of this episode! She had her heart broken and probably lost her faith in men, that show, dating, etc...She has a lot of "recovery" to do. Dating 25 men just does not fit in well in this picture. <br>  <br>  I thought Stephanie would have been a good choice for the next Bachelorette. She was so nice and honest...she really needs to find someone to treat her and her daughter well.|`|rjlCyhdpaa	No!|`|5b2d9c781d88a27e32aaffc386405fa9aa	I wish there was a way for them to bring back Joe Millionaire!|`|VDpmh2VJaa	I quit watching that show after andrew firestone..lol not sure how long ago but long ago..not worth it none of them ever marry etc..!|`|NqcnAnC1aa	Yeah, I still love the show.  I know a lot of it is fake/scripted, but hey, it's good entertainment.  <br>  I was kinda hoping Melissa would be the next Bachelorette too, but I'm just as happy that Jill is the new one because I think she's awesome too!|`|s76aC4G8aa	I plan on watching Jillians airing of the Bachelorette.  I think that ABC had such an overwhelming response to Jillian that they chose her, you don't know, maybe Melissa declined to go on the show, what with everything being still fresh, even though its been since January that this all really happened.  A lot of people are angry with ABC for this an don't plan on watching ABC anymore, I'm a huge LOST fan and it would take more than this to prevent me from tuning out ABC.  Besides they have all the good shows anyway.  So Jason was a jerk for doing this publically but remember, when you agree to do this show you agree that your live life is now the sole property of ABC, your love life is now public and everything that happens they have the right to broadcast it.<br>  <br>  If you want a more understanding of what actually happened, read Chris Harrison's blog and decide for yourself.  I've given the show a break before chances are I'll do it again, not because of what happened with Jason but because the whole thing is just becoming a bit of a bore, I only watched because I really liked Jason on the Bachelor and was glad when they asked him to be the next Bachelor.|`|VoV7jGc3aa	Yeah I will watch again. What Jason did was crappy and if it really was staged by the producers then ABC is crappy too, but I do like the show and he is just one out of how many others that it didn't work out for. The difference is that he made the heartbreak very public. <br>  <br>  I think Melissa would make a good bachelorette, but right now it is way too soon. It wouldn't make her look too good. Maybe they will give her a show next year when she is over all the Jason drama.|`|AA11452399	Duh, Melissa doesnt want to be the next Bachelorette, and Jill was asked months ago and agreed to it. If people are mad about Jason's decision, thats too bad. Life happens and you need not be so quick to judge what you know NOTHING about. Sure it was a lousy break up, but it happens all over the place everyday, its just not in the spotlight. We cant help who we love, and sometimes people get hurt, but at least when he saw it wasnt right, he made a move to change it before it really was too late. Melissa has moved on, as should you. You have to ask yourself are you so perfect that you can stand in judgement of his decision?? No, none of us can, because we are not in his shoes, and you only know what you see on tv, so lighten up already.Move on!|`|n0WnEIopaa	Yes I will watch it, I love Jill. <br>  <br>  Melissa would make an awful choice, if she could get over Jason in lik 2 weeks, and start going for other guys already, it wouldn't only show she wasn't sincere about him.. <br>  <br>  They have to start taping right away, there is no way she would or should be ready.

But she dreamed that her daughter didn't have to live in this way she is so she wanted to make a good name for women, especially black women like herself. So they never feel worthless and used, but appreciated and honored. She had her daughter leafy while living with her master. Because it was so common back in the day, I will assume that she was raped by her white master and she had her baby, who is like mixed race.When the wife of the Master saw Leafy's yellow hair and gray hair, Nanny had gotten beatings. Nanny suffered a lot for Leafy. She escaped one night when all the slaves got free and she found a place to stay temporary with other freed slaves, but during that time she declined a lot of marriage proposals, because she didn't;t want any man mistreating Leafy. So she moved to West Florida and found some good white people to work for, Nanny and LEafy lived on their yard.janie was born when a school  teacher had taken Leafy into the woods and raped her, when she was nothing but 17. Leafy is not in anyone's life. Nanny takes care of Janie.<br>  So when Nanny saw Johnny kissing all up on Janie, Nanny saw what she thought was Janie's first step down the same path she and Leafy had. Nanny desperately wants to see Janie get married before Nanny dies. Nanny prays to god for a husband for Janie. Nanny thinks Janie is loosening up to men and will become vulnerable woman. Logan Killicks is the man who Nanny feels is like a respectable safe bet.<br>  This seems really creepy because Logan is an older man, and for him to had been asking for Janie, so young as she is, seems wrong. Janie says Logan is not her type, but in the next chapter she ends up marrying him. Nanny wants Janie to have security and be respectable young woman, and Nanny thought Logan was thye man to give it to her. But Janie has these passions, that Johnny Taylor satisfies, not Logan. This issue i think burdens Janie thought the book.|`|53Bndus9aa	<a href="http://img300.imageshack.us/img300/4815/96128689.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img300.imageshack.us/img300/4815/...</a><br>  <br>  hahaaha i was asking a question ...this is my friend...and i swear eddie munster and him look exactly the same ...lol|`|Nipbluclaa	ч :D<br>  Coz im cool [:|`|frwlypDWaa	Fellow researchers, investigating UFO sightings in Puerto Rico in the early 1990's, stumbled upon reports by local residents of a strange, dog-like creation who would attack their prey and suck the blood dry.

We not exactly a "christian country" cuz people in America have the right to practice any religion they please. <br>  Second, we don't worship the contestants. It's just a term. To idolize does not necessary me idolatry in the modern sense. It means to to have very strong admirationn or be very excessive admiration of the person. We don't build statues and worship the contestants' image. For example, someone says Jessica Simpson is their idol. That means he or she is a huge fan of Jessica Simpson, not that this person worships, and devotes his or her life to Jessica Simpson.    <br>  <br>  Idol is really a worldwide franchise based on Pop Idol from the UK. <br>  <br>   American Idol was created by British guy (he once managed the Spice Girls).|`|BH9rZzWMaa	What does it being called American Idol have to do with being a christian country?

hOH33uBnaa	Get a metronome and pick in time. Slowly increase the speed until you cant keep up. This will be your timing point. Practice just below this speed until you can get to the next speed. Then keep doing the same thing faster and faster and one day you will be awesome. The problem with being experienced is that slowing down is boring. But if ya want to get better ya need the discipline.<br>  <br>  Happy Playin'|`|sRsUVW24aa	Well...you see...for speed you need some time of practicing.....you can see some licks in youtube and play them.....but the most important thing is that you do it constantly....hammer on,pull of(legato)are great techniques to learn....and since you are a good guitar player(i mean you know the scales,modes....)you should start learning some blues exercises.....there are many on youtube.....the only unusual thing about you is that....you learned the fretboard first...but i know that all the guitarists first learn the speed than the scales....so you are kind of going in the good way,because speed is something that with practice its easy learnedly.......|`|01560ec0c698f8c7ff3f39e65adafb92aa	I agree with the previous poster...you do not pick each individual note...unless you're doing a Doc Watson impersonation?<br>  <br>       You have to utilize hammer-ons and pull-offs to facilitate speed.<br>  <br>       For a quick easy example...pick your open hign E string...then hammer on at the 3rd fret, and immediately pull off the note back to the open E.<br>  <br>       3 notes, with the pick only coming in contact with the string one time.

It makes sense.
13ef8a5ce4c06ca56c3e52bc29e23610aa	For me it would have to be a tie between Infest and Getting Away with Murder|`|wBVuFu3Baa	Papa Roach surely this guy isn't still around.  I thought he'd been put down!|`|hZcqEmbAaa	Infest!! Definitely<br>  I listened to that non-stop when it came out!<br>  What an album!!|`|0b3fa313a09fd3b8730664822eb4455baa	I like all of them.. "Infest" was an amazing album though. :) love 'em all though. :)|`|sVSjpnTEaa	Infest is the best by far. Their more recent work is good but a mere sequel. Best track Broken Home.|`|QxxSSKVQaa	Infest and Metamorphisis|`|ptzm6nboaa	Infest, hands down. The lyrics are so introspective, yet angsty & angry, and relevant to everyone in at least one point of their lives. The instrumental aspect of the album is pretty good as well - not the best, but it could have been a hell of a lot worse. I would recommend it to anyone, PR fan or not!|`|5fca0f4c855584cef8e997bb6c47f32faa	Love, Hate, Tragedy.<br>  <br>  Music-wise there is no contest.
ef4fdcd84e60e1dac24728288eab23faaa	Yes, without a doubt. That album is genius.|`|7fEVNng5aa	IMO, yes. It's the only Megadeth album that I don't get bored with at some point|`|Lngb8ryFaa	i agree with So Far So Good So What...its more loaded with rockin songs.."liar", Hook in mouth", "502", "set the world afire", "anarchy in the UK", "in my darkest hour"...Rust in Piece doesnt measure up song for song|`|7a29609061cc85b8213f55d1598f7a9aaa	It's the heaviest, or fastest, definately the most thrashy.<br>  <br>  They've had so many different styles it's hard to say<br>  <br>  A true, hard core metal fan would definately say yes it is.<br>  <br>  I'm a bit partial to some of the later ones at the mo, even if they have a smattering of sucky songs on them|`|9hCezzwRaa	That album is a masterpiece at it is the best thing with a Megadeth name on it for sure!|`|fB8ujUVNaa	NO. Peace Sells is a classic.<br>  WAKE UP DEAD PEOPLE!!!|`|8RtWoVWiaa	dude united abominations is the best by far|`|dFacbjIZaa	Yes actually it is. In My opinion that is. Me and a good friend and former R&P Reg have nigh on endless argument about Rust In Peace Vs Peace Sells. But I say Rust IS the definitive Megadeth album.|`|sVSjpnTEaa	Rust in Peace is Megadeth at their best. Although Peace Sells.. Who's Buying ? is equal to it purely because of the mind-blowing impact it had in the late 80s. That and the song Black Friday.|`|8Rwjvzhbaa	Its probably his most well-crafted album, although I kind of personally prefer the rawer, rougher-around-the-edges energy of "Peace Sells"|`|fFq0TYodaa	I would say United Abominations, becuause they finally have 2 good guitarists instead of dave+1.<br>  <br>  rust in peace was ok, but never walk alone... a call to arms is an instant classic :)|`|w02Z4Mnhaa	No. So Far, So Good So What is a better album.  However Rust In Peace runs a close third behind Peace Sells.|`|IBvz3tckaa	very close, but Peace Sells is an all time thrash classic.
6zv7ezTeaa	None.|`|mbY2rtd0aa	The Subliminal Verse Pwns!|`|F6w2bYcuaa	Iowa|`|hZcqEmbAaa	I have to say Slipknot. only cause it was my first taste of them, and caused me to actually fall in love with them!!<br>  <br>  Iowa is flippin great too though|`|w02Z4Mnhaa	Iowa.  That album kicks bottom.|`|caLPjFI7aa	best album is either mate feed kill repeat or self titled.  Both of the greatest albums by slipknot.|`|hYOEQdgnaa	iowa|`|hlKEZAp6aa	i prefer their 2 latest albums (subliminal verses and all hope is gone) but everything they do is ******* awesome. get everything. even get stone sour too! (slipknot are better but stone sour still rule)|`|qsPEclFpaa	I would say Iowa, their self-titled, or The Subliminal Verses|`|DdqiznkWaa	The subliminal verses|`|VYkWzoU8aa	I think all hope is gone is the best but iowa is good to|`|Vo9WWQpnaa	Their eponymous first CD

24e3c53ff3387eb84f27768983042d80aa	I KNOW!! <br>  I wanted to see the film because of Sarah Brightman and because so many people from communities I belong to say it was such a great movie so I rented it. When I first saw it I didn't like the songs very much and didn't like that there was hardly any dialog. As soon as finished watching it I placed back in the enveloped and sealed it. But there was something about the movie that stay inside me that was making me wanting to see it again. I re-opened the envelope and watched, I though a little better about it. Then I started listening to the soundtrack online and I started to like the songs more and I also liked more of the characters, so now I want to buy the film.<br>  My favorite characters are the Graverobber, Blind Mag (of course), and Pavi.<br>  I do think Paris did a nice job, not too different from how she usually acts (the sexiness) but nonetheless it was a nice job.|`|r9lfDeRmaa	Yes that movie was genius, kudos to the person who thought that up. The whole plot to the movie was great along with the songs.<br>  <br>  And yes I was surprised as well that Hilton did as well as she did.

Lelouch died already. Why does he had to live & hide away after all he have done?

Tb3hIDy8aa	You should go on youtube, and other websites so your friends will know that you sing.  Then start singing for friends and family.  Join choirs, and singing groups, and then you will get more feel of harmony.  Do musicals, and sing as much as you can whenever you get the chance.  Then, people will start recognizing you, and if you keep just doing as much as you can, you will be noticed.  Also it is a good idea to get a vocal coach because they will always have opportunities for you to do...<br>  Hope this helps! Good luck! :)|`|So4naGxLaa	Record them and put them on myspace or youtube and it does not matter i you cant sing. I cant but i did it anyway. See what you think of mine.

I pay good money to come to this facility and get abused by Whiplash Wendy...|`|LnVbOi4xaa	Slapped in the face, because it would be over in a few minutes, while you would keep thinking about the names and abuse, and it would torture you for a long time. xD|`|xNC1JoPsaa	I have dealt with name calling and it's less of a mental beat down then an actual physical attack, I would say name calling since the only degradation is in whether you care about those that insult you.|`|rpVQpJA7aa	face slapped|`|bHQpwVlXaa	Name calling|`|e663a3eea9acd94ea0c82d74d58bb3cbaa	I would take the names. Because it wouldnt hurt, I dont care what people say.|`|a9LgRjb3aa	slapped in the face because it would only last for a minute but the name calling would effect you for a long time|`|eJjGy1Zoaa	slapped|`|hvZSKn6Eaa	Can i have both please?|`|4kVTJnyCaa	slapped in the face.<br>  laters
gbkBJltXaa	that redundant! But here's a better one: If there were to be a porn parody of a recent batman movie, it would probably be of the "Dark Knight". The title would be "Dark D!ck", Batman would be called "Bangman", his enemy would be "the Poker", his sidekick would be Swallow, and Harvey Dent (aka two face) would be Harley Dix (aka two ****) and C#ntwoman would join in for a lesbian threesome in place of Catwoman. Enjoy the laugh.|`|OAuMPsynaa	That is a sad state of affairs.!
TAGC3FNOaa	um people that work in shops like that dont wear strap ons or anything...just go normal...
PKsldf8Caa	One thing I've found that helps is just to write your thoughts down in the order that you have them, but make sure that you write them down by lines, not just like you're writing an essay. Then, try to work with them until you get some sort of melody going in your head, then try to mold those thoughts to it. That's how I write a lot of my songs, and it works pretty nicely. As for actual content, I can't tell you what to write. That's the beauty of songwriting. It's your thoughts and no one else's. Besides, I can't write a song and communicate it without singing it :) I hope this helps!!|`|eD2SzJ2Jaa	ima gangster a straight up g?|`|b6Y3sFjsaa	Filled with doubt, down and out, what the hell is this life all about . . . The failings of my family weigh heavy on my heart, but I know too that I have played my part . . . <br>  <br>  Something like that maybe?<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|3JWoodB6aa	well you can start is out by writing "all the time we spent together made me feel so alive. so when i think of you i call you in the night"  if that works for you or if it helped give me 10 points thx and i wrote a song for my gf to and sang it to her she loved it good luck

76740ad28a40658e6b40499a8b2cb447aa	I think Lil and Scott will make it based on popularity (though I love Scott), but the other one is up for grabs. Could be Jorge, could be Ju'Not, I don't know. I'd personally like to see Kristen make it because I love her, but I'm afraid her bad song choice may have cost her (I voted for her 2 hours straight, just in case,though). If so, I hope she comes back as a Wild Card. But I'm pretty sure Lil and Scott will make it. And if not Kristen, I hope the 3rd spot goes to Ju'Not because he is original and he made the song his own, which I feel separates a real artist from a good Karaoke singer. But then again, Jorge is a good singer too,so I don't know. I guess I'll just leave it at Lil, Scott and ??? :p. But I would love for it to be Kristen or Ju'Not.|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	Lil, Scott, and Jorge...but I think Kristen has a good sporting chance, and I actually kinda liked Kelsey too (I think that was her name- the country girl in the yellow dress). That group was the best of all three so far. And it seemed like EVERYONE on the show had more FUN, and the judges were nicer.|`|On5mPAb6aa	I think Lil, Scott, and Jorge will make it through.|`|MdqFclDbaa	to be honest I thought everyone in that group did very bad except for Lil Rounds. I was disappointed!|`|xmdh8iY3aa	I think its between four of them<br>  <br>  Scott and Jorge on the men<br>  Lil Rounds and Felicia on the women<br>  <br>  Ju'not and Kendall have outside shots but I don't expect either to get through.|`|AA12315431	has anyone ever noticed (besides VFTW) that whoever goes last (the pimp spot) always makes it through because people remember them? The producers put people last who they want to be in the competition. it is soooo obvious that it makes me roll my eyes every time. Lets see:<br>  <br>  Danny Gokey went last the first week= made it<br>  Adam Lambert went last 2nd week= made it<br>  Lil Rounds went last third week= we all know she will make it<br>  <br>  Does anyone else see a pattern here? Can anyone deny that this show is fixed? There is no way it is just a coincidence.<br>  other than her it will probably be Scott and Ju'not or Jorge.|`|uC75y83Taa	I like Lil.  A lot!  I think she chose the wrong song, but you'll see that she is excellent. So I like Lil, Ju'not, and either Jorge, Scott, Kristen, or maybe Felicia. I do NOT want Von Smith. (He went first.) :)|`|Qbf4KSRUaa	Jorge actually has the best voice and illegals can vote in this election. He'll be the next Americano idol.|`|AA12370001	honestly stopped watching two weeks ago.  The show is boring and predictable.
18K7ucsEaa	The first line is C, A, E, B<br>  next: B, F, E, (but they may be minor or 7 chords... not too sure)<br>  use the first line chords to reference the others... and you can't really translate the high part to chords, just play that or continue the chord progression.<br>  <br>  <br>  :-D|`|F7YU3FFraa	It's easier for me to read Tabs. Let me explain.<br>  <br>  In the first Measure you posted, the numbers represent the frets that you play. e,B,G,D,A,E are each string, from thinest to thickest.<br>  <br>  So place your fingers on the 6th fret of string 3&4 and on the 4th fret of string 5.<br>  <br>  Be sure to line them up, if they are in a vertical row exactly above each other, that means you play them at the same time.<br>  <br>  Also, if there is no number on a string, that string is not played. A 0 indicates an "open" strum (not frets held down on a certain string).<br>  <br>  Likewise with all the rest.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope I helped.|`|zH1QoTkWaa	It took you longer to type this question than it would take you to play those chords. (if u understood tabs)|`|5xQESoC4aa	I can't translate it, but thats really easy to play. :)
crKEVJi5aa	you can only go 68 SPM sex per min because at 69 you have to turn your a_s_s around.|`|Kg8OJnfmaa	there is no speed too fast to go while having sex|`|mqgS6Dfxaa	68 MPH.  <br>  69 is too dangerous when driving.

p3rnyBoYaa	I think anoop will be back for wild card night.<br>  <br>  My favorite is Danny so far.|`|dSSFrYUxaa	Danny all the way|`|aihogb26aa	I'm not  picking a favorite until the official top 12 is announced. We still have the results show from tonight and the wild card Thursday. Plus, we've only seen some of the singers do one or two performances, and then we've had others who have been shoved down our throats. I'd rather go in with an open mind and give evryone a chance. These rounds have shown us some great singers who were ignored by the show for most of the auditions and Hollywood week (Allison iraheta, Kris Allen, Alexis Grace, Ju'Not, Jorge, etc.). From the beginning, I've liked Anoop (who I think is still a lock to get in through the wild card), but I'll wait and see.|`|EER9kCrTaa	I had no favorites until this round.<br>  Mine are currently Kris Allen and Allison Iraheta. <br>  I like Ju'Not, Scott, Lil Rounds and Felicia from last night. Hope some of them will get voted to top 12.<br>  <br>  Btw, I do think Anoop will get through with wild card. I liked him from the 1st group too.|`|QVY9Fnpoaa	My top 6 in any order<br>  Anoop Desai<br>  Lil Rounds<br>  Matt Giraud<br>  Danny Gokey<br>  Megan Corkrey<br>  Scott McIntyre<br>  <br>  Good thing Anoop, Matt and Megan are now in the Top 13
HOQp0gA7aa	I was going to use Croker too, but I was beat to it (thumb given).

Joe (it's like "Jow", but not)? Diago? Peter? Kyosuke? Stan? Fred? Mark? The Mime? Sven? Johann? Josh? Hans? Trent? Fernando?  Bazza? Fei Long? Pierre? Joseph? Kyle? Black Jack? Ace? Spade (not being racist)? Ink? Contrast? Fade? Shade? Emo Clown (but then again all emos are clowns. Am I right? No? Just gonna leave me hanging? fine. Be an asss.)? Chi (Yin and Yang stuff)? Zebra?

v0Iuceg3aa	Slumdog Millionaire was a great movie about love, crime, and destiny. But I'd say that City of God is more, grittier, intense, realistic, and touches you in a lot of ways. City of God taps into a lot of your emotions and shows you that in life there aren't a lot of easy answers. I wish I could say both are as good as the other, but I'd say City of God is better.|`|rofbhrEeaa	You know what, I watched this video before an hour i think.

cr5TQgmUaa	He was in it from the beginning. His character, Helo, in the Battlestar Galactica miniseries was not supposed to return for the regular run of the show. Audience response to Helo was so strong the producers created an entire subplot for the character in the second series, set on the destroyed homeworld of Caprica.|`|B5xrYsuxaa	do you mean Helo? then yes, he has been on battlestar since day 1 and it is odd to see him on dollhouse (at least for me)|`|dYYU2gsKaa	Had to check imdb.com but Helo appears in the original mini-series with the rank of Lieutenant - he's a Captain in the later episodes (post S03E06).<br>  <br>  A full profile for the character can be found at<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Agathon" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Agatho...</a>

Why would she take him back if he was? She probably hit him and he was trying to defend himself, because there is no way I would take him back if he just "attacked me!"|`|4rFCesSsaa	I think he is.  I saw the photos and he admitted it.|`|CSuEiHgGaa	Awful? Annoying? And i do think so|`|CPLXGc9qaa	if he did rihanna is stupid as **** to take him back ...oh its ok chris if you beat me sensless ill take you back <br>  <br>  <br>  that doesnt seem to make sense <br>  <br>  <br>  maybe rihanna hit her self <br>  <br>  <br>  i dont know i just think alll this is over rated regular people get beat up everyday by there spouses and no one pays attention to them its overrated like how the paparazzi is obsessed with angelina jolie and brad pitt let them live a life without a camera in there face for just once!!!|`|8eeee84248737295c60d88565ceb0559aa	I do.<br>  <br>  "why would she take him back" most women do for some reason.  Look up the statistics.<br>  <br>  He'll be arraigned soon and if he is found guilty it should be looked upon the same as rape.<br>  <br>  Unless its out of self-defense you don't hit women.  A man can restrain a woman without punching her.  Its not difficult, we're physically dominant many times more often than not.<br>  <br>  Its a sign of insecurity, weakness and immaturity when a man feels the need to strike a woman.  Wish he would have done that with someone like me around.|`|gYyW39wTaa	I still love him

gUYcVXMTaa	I would go with Illmatic as the better of the two but both very very good albums which I play on the reg.<br>  <br>  I would go with Reasonable Doubt out of those two!  Dynasty was a great album and had many hits I loved but Reasonable Doubt is up there for me truly one of my fav albums of all time!|`|NzkPEKYgaa	Illmatic > It Was Written<br>  <br>  Reasonable Doubt > Dynasty|`|DSJOxz0Qaa	"That buck that bought the bottle could have struck the lotto"...it just doesn't get any better than that.  I would say for the time and for busting on the scene, Illmatic is my choice.|`|hcbY89Praa	Illmatic, although It Was Written is great....<br>  <br>  <br>  And EASILY Reasonable Doubt, that one isn't even close...|`|7SPe4iRbaa	illmatic not by much BUT i gotta pick it<br>  reasonable doubt....|`|sMgDlW2Aaa	I'm feeling it and dead prez are my absolute fav jigga songs so reasonable doubt, as for nas... I dunno, I liked his I AM cd the most|`|0f43ff2eed25039880a5e743d8087199aa	I love Dynasty more...wait Reasonable doubt...yeah you're right hard to choose.  But doesn't that intro to the Dynasty just get you every time?|`|TJyTAwDxaa	illmatic - reasonable doubt...... c'mon now.
1cfMOZ36aa	even if she does die kishi wont kill her so easily and nerdy. as long as hinata doesnt have a subconscious playback of her life and failures she will live.<br>  <br>  <br>  kakashi also is alive........and will not die just yet if at all|`|ZfsgIDa0aa	Well besides the fact that Tsunade's slugs are no where near the actual battle field, even if Hinata some how survives... SHE'S ON THE BATTLE FIELD FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!!!! Remember how Naruto goes absolutely apeshitt in 4-tail mode (Even hurt Sakura)? What do you think a 6-tailed Naruto will do? Will Hinata really survive a rampaging Naruto, especially in her condition? I honestly hope she lives, I really do, but I don't see it happening.|`|f4ed8d9c313d778ec37048e45a66bd35aa	yeah shes not dead just knocked out she wont die she can't die not right after she finally told naruto how she feels about him that would suck BAD!|`|stYO4Q1Haa	saw some of the spoilers mate Hinata just had the wind knocked out of her thats all. Pain infact never stabbed her. he spared her if you look at page 15 of Naruto in chapter 437 you will see why. just have a very close look okay and you will see what i mean.<br>  <br>  if they killed off Konaha 11 characters they would have done so by now but they haven't killed any. this was one way to raise the suspense because to be honest it was starting to get quite boring.<br>  <br>  team Guy is on there way i also have a feeling that Neji is going to do something important to the story but hey i don't have clue what he will do maybe save Hinata|`|35aa6dcf3de4ecb9aa30d3c58ec123edaa	Well yes she will live rmb the storyline is focused not only on Naruto but the other Konoha 11 characters who are supposed to be the next generation so killing off Hinata is like removing Mickey Mouse from Disneyland. <br>  <br>  Oh and i just saw chapter 438 spoilers and it shows that Hinata is still alive and that branch guy asked Sakura to quickly help Hinata. (hope it's true)|`|3J0utfJXaa	maybe with the slugs yeah she'll be alive, i never thought of that i thought maybe sakura of someone would save her. i put 50/50 that she's alive ^-^ nice theory though!
NegtUpNcaa	Actually, yeah it did happen. If you watch the music video to the very end, it shows a pic of his brother and the date he died. It's really sad :(|`|nAK82h6vaa	I don't think it really happen.Seether is a awesome group though|`|94qW6Y1saa	It did not really happen.|`|CPLXGc9qaa	no no no it didnt happen really it was just an act to go with the song

3YIjKQTEaa	Just seen this movie and I loved it but by the sounds of it you won't. <br>  <br>  If you didn't like the Dark knight, I don't know what's wrong with you;-) but I think that means you won't like it. It is different from most comic book movies, it's definitely for Adults, graphic violence, sex, nudity. But it's a very Intelligent movie full of difficult ideas about the nature of humanity. <br>  <br>  I really liked it but you might struggle, if you're willing to try it though I'd give it a go.|`|P0T4lHKTaa	The watch men will be a big bad *** action movie, i never read the comic books, but i did watch spiderman( and yes they sucked ***) all the batmans( all amazing, especially the dark night) and sin city was ok.

UCq7SjsRaa	When I was 17 I had a boyfriend who was a well known erotica photographer. As part of our personal sex life he took photos of me (they were completely private) and then a year after we broke up I found that he'd published them in a kinky coffee table book!!! While we were taking them I was all fun, but now I've got to live the fact that strangers can look at me whenever they like and it's not a great feeling especially as I've changed my lifestyle drastically. I've also had people at work say to me "Oh, I saw you in a kinky book the other day!" Grrrrr. I wouldn't recommend doing pornographic photos or films just because you're showing a private a emotionally changable side to yourself and you may change your attitude towards the images, but the images remain forever.|`|Y5j2Cr14aa	I am making one now wanna join?|`|wKbRwH3haa	Yeh it was fun, no regrets, never regret anything you do in life!|`|bGyVJ6meaa	How much money are they offering you then, or have you alreasy "sealed the deal"?|`|RS6pMCZhaa	besides falling in the trash i cant remember XD rate me the best for making you not laugh but...chuckle|`|xxDAbVXVaa	haha bit of a strange question|`|Cwn5Eo9jaa	It has crossed my mind many times, but the fact that my tattoos will be noticed by anyone who knows me has made me think twice :)|`|orGvWwhBaa	I never have but I definitely would!|`|8kZUYvhFaa	i didn't actually put in out in public but we video camed it.

AA10356243	It never left, Just the fighting between the NAB (National Association of Broadcasters - Who represent radio and TV stations in Congress) and the LPFM community with major force being helped along by the Prometheus Radio Project people and what is considered interference...<br>  <br>  Basically the NAB wants the LPFMs to hold to Class A broadcast radio spacing (which would knock LPFMs even from trying to come in, in many cities) to a tighter second ajacent frequency (basically spacing the LPFM two stations away from the local station instead of three for instance) with the argument that radios are better these days for selecting one station over another (this was the reason for the hotly contested rules.. older and cheap made radios will have a bad time of picking out the two seperate stations on second ajacent.<br>  <br>  The internet has given a voice to some, but it's hard when you are not found there, radio has the advantage as it  can be carried around with you and most people listen to music or radio in say a car where the stations would help, or even in Hurricanes (Like Brice Phillips WQRZ-LP in Mississippi) where computers are useless.<br>  <br>  So for me, they never left, It just isn't at the forefront everyone thought it would be

Definitely. Have no fear,sir. <br>  Everything else is just a fad but Rock n' Roll stays.<br>  And Great Rock n' Roll just moves along ex. Led Zeppelin,the Doors,Metallica (some people listen to them like their new & just learning about Kill 'em All,Master of Puppets & Ride the Lightening); what I'm saying is there are great songs made by great rock n' roll bands and they will be listened to for years to come.And as long as these songs are around someone will want to be the next Rock N' Roll God and someone will have the gift to be a great musician and thus create more rock n' roll music. Look who came after the Beatles and Elvis and Sabbath.<br>  Nirvana also had an impact and will be remembered for some time.|`|ObeBvtzgaa	There's still a lot of real metal bands around. Also many people (including me) still listen to bands like Led Zeppelin and Guns N' Roses (the old GN'R, not Axl's new band) and they're not still making albums, why wouldn't the future generations do the same?|`|zUi3nIPRaa	what do you mean about to lose ac/dc they died with bon scott|`|5HvdcWvBaa	I bloody well hope SOOOO!!! XD<br>  <br>  And yes, I have no reason to think its going anywhere!! YAY!!!|`|8bmu9lwnaa	Rock N Roll will always be around. You got your great old bands, such Led Zeppelin, Motley Crue, Doors, Grateful Dead, and the latter AC/DC. CD's by those bands and songs will be around, forever. Alot of youth in this generation are starting to appreciate that style of music, even the Jonas Brothers, who have covered songs by Stevie Wonder and The Beatles. But while the old stuff is still excellent, alot of new bands are "head-bang worthy" as well. Alot of new rock bands are "children" per se of the classic rock generation. Bands such as Black Stone Cherry, Foo Fighters, and even Nickelback are the sound of a new style of rock music. Just like rock music has changed in the past, from the rockabilly 50's style to the acid-tripping style of the 60's and the pop oriented sound of the 80s. Rock N Roll will always be around, in one way or another. Except alot of those good classic bands need to stop flirting with the country style, I mean Bon Jovi, and Def Leppard. Also, if your looking for a band that sounds relatively close to AC/DC, i'd check out Airbourne, they are the closet tbing to AC/DC i've ever heard.|`|gJ8F634Haa	I think for a while there it looked like the love of Rock was slipping away (thanks to MTV taking a major left turn) with the newer generation liking rap and hip hip more.  But, now I am seeing a major turn around with kids today.  More and more are beginning to appreciate the talent and depth of Rock and Roll.  When my kids got caught up in the Rap world and my husband and I were like "What the Hell happened".  Now my kids want to learn instruments and have an appriecation for rock both classic and with the new bands.  Thank God!|`|89xzNpVaaa	Yeah, what do you really mean by loosing AC/DC?<br>  Im not sure, but you know i think Rock music took a break now, now its the era for crappy music, just wait its coming. It will be back, mate.|`|eBt2wwkFaa	not in the same way it used to. I'd say rock, as in classic (AKA best) died a long time ago.

So there is obviously still a market for it.<br>  It's the same with John Mayer, there is not an empty seat when he performs.<br>  I am young and don't have one rap song because i hate it.

AA11295282	It really depends on what type of dog you have and what type you are getting. Each breed of dog has a different temperament. If you are getting same sex dogs they will generally have a few squabbles until they find out who is the alpha male/female. Once this is sorted they are usually ok. If the dogs will be a different sex, as a rule they don't generally fight but there may be one or two squabbles. You have to be firm and make sure they know you are the boss. As for jealousy make sure both dogs are treated the same and they will be fine.|`|UFu0h8SKaa	when you bring a new pet in the house you have to treat the old one better, and he needs to be the dominant one. just until they get used to eachother.

Just at first|`|57695d6cd2bdf46926c92c61db0be293aa	not really, keep the new one on a leash maybe, i think.|`|CQX3TAIoaa	Um, your question is in the wrong section. :D<br>  <br>  Anyway, I think you should arrange for your dogs to first meet outside of your home, like in a park or something. That way your dog doesn't feel that her home is being invaded, and she can meet the new dog without any worries of defending her space. (Dogs are territorial remember?)<br>  <br>  Dogs are generally very friendly with one another, and will readily accept new dogs without much of a fuss. Cats on the other hand, tend to go berzerk. <br>  <br>  If your dog is laid back, I don't think there is much reason to worry. But make sure you pay a lot of attention to your old dog, so that she doesn't feel that this newcomer is taking you away from her. <br>  <br>  I can recommend doggy manga for you as well, since we're in the C&A sections :P<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mangafox.com/page/manga/series/859/inubaka/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mangafox.com/page/manga/serie...</a><br>  Inubaka<br>  All alone except for her loyal mutt Lupin, 18-year-old Suguri moves from the countryside to the big city to find a career and a new life!<br>  In her first job at a pet store, she meets an assortment of quirky dogs and even stranger owners!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mangafox.com/page/manga/series/1903/eien_no_with/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mangafox.com/page/manga/serie...</a><br>  Eien no With<br>  With her mom always fussing over her baby brother, her father busy with work, and no friends at school, Hitomi has always felt lonely.

tuvcxnJXaa	Honestly, I've never understood why Sarah McLachlan's 'Fumbling Toward Ecstasy' wasn't on every "Greatest Albums" list coming and going.   That album is EPIC in every sense.    She's produced some good -- even great -- material before and since, but nothing has measured up to that effort.    There's not a bad note on it.   Maybe because it's something of a "mood" album is the reason it's gotten passed over by time.<br>  <br>  Queensryche's 'Operation : Mindcrime' deserves a mention, also.   That album was released at the height of hair band mania, and both the album and the band have taken a huge hit because of that.   It's a masterpiece, and it's only developed something of a cult following.   I feel strongly it should be in everyone's record collection.|`|ME4XWNmRaa	News Of The World- Queen|`|aKBqMLuhaa	Mike Oldfield ~ "Tubular Bells" ....LOL sorry but I have such tortured memories of this album. <br>  <br>  Shooting Rubber Bands at the Moon ~ Edie Brickell and the New Bohemians<br>  Blind Man's Zoo ~ 10000 Maniacs<br>  Eat A Peach ~ Allman Brothers<br>  Fight for your mind ~ Ben Harper<br>  Blues Traveler ~ Blues Traveler<br>  Streetlights ~ Bonnie Raitt<br>  A Long Time Comin' ~ Electric Flag<br>  Indigo Girls ~ Indigo Girls<br>  The Best of Jackson Browne ~ Jackson Browne<br>  Come Away With Me ~ Nora Jones<br>  Graceland ~ Paul Simon<br>  <br>  Just to name a few.....|`|NQ37mnWkaa	Good afternoon Jake :)<br>  <br>  <br>  Mellow Candle ~ "Swaddling Songs"<br>  <br>  Mike Oldfield ~ "Tubular Bells" ; "Hergest Ridge" ; "Ommadawn" ; "Incantations"<br>  {there only seems to be me and Fonzie who ever mention them!}<br>  <br>  <br>  Deke : <br>  It is indeed the best of all of Sarah's albums, especially if you can get the one with the piano-only version of 'Possession', and her cover of Joni Mitchell's 'Blue'...|`|ZzqWzFNiaa	Devo - Q: Are We Not Men?

nRnokrwKaa	I believe that Rock pioneered the 'bad boy' image that is perceived as socially desirable by many young people today. Rock has always been an agent of rebellion, a way that anti-social messages and unacceptable social customs have been vocalised. I believe it can be summarised in the opinion of Jack Black in the movie 'School of Rock', in which he states that Rock is about 'sticking it to the man'; the man in this case being society in general and all of the 'civilised' attributes accepted by it. Modern Rock music, particularly etal in its various forms, provide dark viewpoints on the world and allow a different slant on society and life as a whole from that publicised by more mainstream media, which is often why people see it is subversive to the greater good of society; a viewpoint I disagree with totally. <br>  So while metal provides this dark, almost anarchistic or destructive point of view through its philosophy of dealing with negativity, sub-genres like modern punk, while sometimes focusing on those areas covered by metal (for example, the various disciples of the sex pistols that come about occasionally), much punk relates to the feelings of young people, particularly relating to relationships and social situations. Generally, I believe that Rock is about emotion, whether it be the emotion of loving a woman/man, the emotion of anger or hatred (which are too often ignored completely by other genres, despite the fact that we all feel them sometimes), the emotion of sadness, or the emotion of joy (what's more joyful than listening to a ripping solo!), and provides an outlet for those emotions when followers of the genre listen to the songs.|`|qsPEclFpaa	I really don't think it has an effect on society. It's just something like to listen to. For the people who try to be like what they listen to, they are just stupid. Politicians think its both a distraction and form or rebellion because they wouldn't say it has appropriate lyrics and its to dark or something like that. Music is music, its their chose to listen to it. And its their choice to listen to what they want.|`|bb2c6db52d268375a8f75ea7c3169389aa	I think it has meaning to those who find meaning in it. If someone is inspired positively and it respects others, let them be. <br>  <br>  The idea here though is that people that listen to these genres participate in society. Who can answer that? I know some rockers that want nothing to do with society. It's all choices.|`|qyOXOa8Taa	My mom calls it "angry music" but i think shes crazy. she took my disturbed CD because it was un edited and they were talkin about killing their mom. "stick ur hand in my face again b____. f____ you i dont need this s____. ur a stupid m--f----ho--. F---YOU!!! that kind of thing pretty crazy. i cant to turn 18 she cant tell me wat to listen to then!!!!  yea but i like that music she REALLY HATES IT|`|F5Jms9OBaa	GETS YOU PUMPED!!!!!|`|wOc4Dqllaa	I think that kids who are already rebellious by nature turn to rock music, particularly the angrier genres like punk and metal, and thereby find common ground with other rebellious kids. They feed each other's rebelliousness, so in a way, rock music does cause rebellion. Of course, there're plenty of artists who openly support rebelling against The Man, and kids who admire those artists will adopt their viewpoints and opinions. Rebellious teenagers often grow into adults who defy the social order, so, yes, I do think that rock music plays a major role in society.|`|kP0JGI1waa	its really a creative outlet for society.  whether someone expresses themselves with tearful acoustic ballads or satanic death metal songs.  also, people enjoy listening to music and connecting with others who share the same musical interests.  music can be calming, exciting, or somewhere in between.  rock and metal havent really affected politics, they are more of a way of expresses distrust/anger with them.  (exception, rage against the machine taking the floor at the UN to talk about mumia).|`|cbZdeOSPaa	I think it has a positive effect because Rock & Metal are "in your face" genres which rarely restrict their feelings, in other words, these genres express what many of us think or feel towards society matters and aren't afraid of telling the world about them. It could be thought of as a form of rebellion but it can't be ignored because it reflects the people's dissent towards what politicians or society. In conclusion, Rock & Metal, in all its forms, is a form of expression given by music that reflects the attitude of people towards certain matters.|`|OTFzJbaMaa	i think well i think it does bring a certain amount of rebellion, exspecially against politicians and old school catholic mothers. <br>  but i think metal is looked at as something that is santanic when alot of it isnt. <br>  i hear so many times poeple saying " are metallica satanists"? and " is marylin manson the anti christ" its just kind of ridiculous. <br>  like marylin manson got blames for colembine which is nothing short of abserd.|`|8RflQ9DVaa	I don't think it 'effects' society, I think it is merely a reflection of society and a voice for people that otherwise feel like they wouldn't have a voice if it wasn't for music.

hzH75VDXaa	I don't know what years they are from but here's a list of movies from Japan that I've enjoyed.<br>  <br>  One Missed Call - the original Takashi Miike version, not that bad American remake. They even changed the ringtone, so disappointing.<br>  The Great Yokai War<br>  Princess Raccoon<br>  Maiko-Haaaan - I might be missing an a there. Such a stupid funny movie.<br>  Big Bang Love, Juvenile A -- very interesting movie. It has some really beautiful shots.<br>  Densha Otoko<br>  Battle Royale (pretty sure it's earlier than what you  are asking, but I'm not sure)<br>  Yatterman - I don't think it's out yet. I saw an advanced screening at The NY comicon. I was a little worried, but ti was great.<br>  Letters from Iwo Jima -- yeah Clint Eastwood directed it, but it's still a movie from Japan. And it has Shido Nakamura. Such a great actor.<br>  Noriko's Dinner table -- this a sequel to Suicide Club which is another movie you should watch if you haven't.<br>  Koizora<br>  Godzilla Final Wars -- Bad bad movie, but a good bad movie, you know what I mean?<br>  Crows ZERO  -- the sequel comes out this year.<br>  Waterboys<br>  Tokyo Gore Police -- very freaky movie. It has Eihi Shiina who I've loved ever since seeing her in Audition. Another  movie you should see if you haven't.<br>  Sukiyaki Western: Django -- great film, a western though.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hmmm, my love of Takashi Miike is showing big time.<br>  <br>  I saw in another question that you don't like anime, so I'm not mentioning any anime.<br>  Yatterman is based on an anime though.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  I feel the need to warn you about Tokyo Gore Police.<br>  Watch the trailer. If the trailer makes you think hmm cool, or wow what a weird movie, then ok. Many people will see that trailer and either be completely freaked out, want to throw up, or be completely disgusted.<br>  <br>  Oh and buy the dvds when they come out. I don't mind downloading, as long as you buy the dvds when they come out.<br>  A lot of these movies haven't been released in the US yet.|`|HOQp0gA7aa	I would have given some examples until you mentioned download.  I try to support the original creator's efforts, and as a personal choice I don't advocate obtaining copies of films in violation of the copyright holders rights to payment for their work.

b9wICW1Paa	Both the real John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll, and James Graham, 1st Duke of Montrose, portrayed respectively by Andrew Kier and John Hurt, were much younger than the characters in the time period of the film.  Graham was already a Duke by this time as well, not a Marquess as portrayed in the film.  <br>  <br>  It seems that in fact one of Rob's own men stole the money lent by Graham, as the characters were led to believe in the movie (by Eric Stolz's character).  It is unclear from my research whether the character of Archibald Cunningham existed.
7XM4QJiuaa	I think so.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	Yes it sure does. Lucky is actually treating her like Rebecca not Emily and treating her all freakish and staring at her the way the rest  of the town is doing.|`|AA12315431	I am not sure if she is falling for him yet. I mean she barely knows the guy. I think she just feels comfortable around him because he doesn't treat her like the reincarnation of Emily or stare at her like she's a ghost. I don't balme her for being put off like that.|`|b2f5cc892d9a2ff6d43172b4bb022096aa	I don't know if she is falling for him, rather than just he is the first person to talk to HER and not Emily.  I don;t think Lucky would  try to have a 'thing' with her,  , knowing how it would mess with Nikolas's head, Also,  Lucky has been putting a LOT of effort into being with Elizabeth, his one true love.|`|M1ymLE9Paa	It does look that way.  I think she likes that he treats her like a person, instead of a ghost of Emily.  If the whole town was treating me the way Rebecca has been treated, I'd be a little weary too, and I'd be more receptive to someone who actually seemed to want to get to know me for me, instead of wanting to be around me b/c I looked like a dead woman.|`|ZmGOL8kCaa	Yeah, and I think they'd be cute together. :P|`|5f0111f71db8592710a5d1cb4897be4aaa	yes,,,it looks that way to me too.<br>   I also noticed how her eyes were glued to Sonny too . I just wish Nikolas would stop stalking her so she could see what a great guy he is . I don't see a good outcome IF she hooks up with Lucky. I'm sick of the brother loving brothers girlfriend/wife story lines.<br>  <br>   ( I don't think I like this girl )|`|VAp5ICaBaa	It looks that way to me too and I think it would be great if they got together and then we find out she really is Emily what a great feud that would be between Nikolas and Lucky.|`|39cf945a4e570ec03e0673777fc1d801aa	Looks like she has the hots for Lucky.  Elizabeth won't be to happy about that.

Whether it was the grocery store or stopping at a gas station or just walking downtown.<br>  <br>  Then, one day I was with a friend going through the Taco Bell drive thru and I said "I see this guy with dreadlocks everywhere I go. It's getting kind of creepy" then we pulled around to get our food and he was WORKING THE DRIVE THRU WINDOW!!!<br>  <br>  Then I met this other guy at a party a week or so later and we started hanging out.

j06SPzuhaa	They sneeze.|`|1DT7OUuHaa	Good question.  Most movies can't stop filming because one of the stars has a cold as expensive as their budgets are it would cost a fortune.  Sometimes they'll shoot other scenes that don't have that actor until they get better.  Make-up tricks can disguise red noses and some other signs of a cold.  Sometimes they will build it into the plot especially on a tv show.  I think they take the same meds. though that we take for colds.|`|mzTKLHjxaa	I've always thought about this! I'm actually an actor myself and recently I've had glandular fever, which has completely wiped me off the face of the earth for two months, meaning I haven't been able to attend auditions and the like. <br>  <br>  Actors are like everyone else. If they get ill, they can't work.<br>  <br>  However, there is a little rule-of-thumb in the industry which is if it's "above the neck" (i.e, a head cold, sniffles, sneezes, etc), you're meant to carry on regardless; if it's "below the neck" (chest infection) or comes with chills and fevers, shooting and scenes usually have to get moved around.<br>  <br>  Soaps have it particularly difficult, as all the scenes and schedules are arranged about a week before the shoot, so these guys have to carry on regardless perhaps even more so than film actors, as at least in films you can go off and film other scenes!

I also was mad they did it to Mike.

They showed previews for next week, so watching them you know who is definitely still there.  However, I was soooooo mad when it said, "TO BE CONTINUED" that I wasn't focused enough to watch it.

d02c709e184c7a1f7828d9e3e00c32b4aa	This shouldn't come as a shock to anyone.  Trent is essentially an island, a true loner in every sense of the word.  We are talking about not just a musician but also a celebrity in that virtually nothing is known about his personal life.  Not that it should matter, but I find it amazing how little we know about the man considering he's been a famous person for twenty years.  The only way you can guard your privacy that fiercely is to be super removed from daily human contact.  <br>  <br>  As far as how Trent operates, it shouldn't be any surprise that he works best alone.  He's fiercely independent and doesn't take well to being told what do.  This accounts for his legendary struggles with major labels early in his career.  For all intents and purposes, Nine Inch Nails was never a group.  It's always been a solo act.  The members other than Trent are nothing more than interchangeable parts of a machine or hired guns.  It's all Trent.  NIN is nothing more than a nickname for the real man behind the curtain.<br>  <br>  For the record, I don't think it's strange that he works best alone.  Some people are just wired that way and for us to pass judgment on it would be a dubious proposition.|`|anqIOoQ1aa	My opinion is the same as for Todd Rundgren--it's quite an accomplishment.  Todd has done it MANY times.  The following albums are all TR--writing, playing, producing:<br>  Hermit of Mink Hollow<br>  Healing<br>  A Wizard, A True Star<br>  Liars<br>  Arena<br>  <br>  and half of Something/Anything and Initiation.  (I think there's more...)|`|7sqjaYx6aa	i like all NIN albums|`|12QJ9QMRaa	Worked like a charm up through the Fragile.<br>  <br>  Seems like he had a lot of ideas and thoughts and anger to express.<br>  <br>  And it avoided the ego clashing that destoys so many bands.<br>  <br>  I don't htink it is his approach that has changed... I just think that when you make your name by producing angry music, eventually, as you grow up and mature, you tend to become more introspective, and just can't run on the raw emotions that they did when they were younger and the world was balck and white.<br>  <br>  It is just hard to maintain being psissed off all the time.  I think that is more the reason you see bands liek NIN and Metallica lose their edge...it has nothing to do with selling out, becuase they ar ebeing true to who they are NOW, instead of being like Slayer and trying to pretend that they are still pissed 18 year olds.  (which tends to go from making truly angry music to looking like a cartoon version o fyourself.)<br>  <br>  I can't think of one singel "Angry " musician that has truly kept that creative fire that their single minded self-righteous indignation coupled with simplistic world view allowed them to have in their youth. Not NIN, not Megadeth, not Metallica, and definitely not Slayer.<br>  <br>  Lets face it...getting old kinda sucks, cause you just don't have the energy, or the fanatical fervor you once had.|`|a79b8a93426576f5d2c9cb6a23ba338faa	Some Nine Inch Nails songs are amazing.  If those songs were made by him solo, then he should probably keep going in that direction.|`|NQ37mnWkaa	This, for me, is interesting...<br>  <br>  The only song I know is 'Dead Souls' {and I have literally just found out it's a cover song!}, and I never would have guessed that it was by a 'one man band'. <br>  <br>  <br>  As Migh says, rather like early Mike Oldfield, although he did bring in some guest musicians on his early albums {including his brother}, and on later albums got the people he felt best suited his work, but he was always fully in creative control of the music. I guess it was a bit like a composer hand-picking the members of the orchestra...|`|3e6758fcfd02678034cc2b0ff260959eaa	his approach was good for me... he was a 'man with a plan' imo, not all that uncommon in the world of Industrial/Electronic music... there have been a fair few 'visionaries'- talented multi- instrumentalists in that field... look at Al Jourgensen when he started out with Ministry (well... 'Twitch' era), Steve Stapleton with Nurse With Wound, Jim Thirlwell and his gazillion projects, Boyd Rice and NON, Monte Cazazza etc... it's the kind of music that can be produced by just one artist, though in most cases additional musicians are used in the live setting of course.<br>  <br>  I totally love 'Pretty Hate Machine' 'cos i see it like that, his 'vision'... he had been in bands before, but decided to adopt the 'persona' of NIN and produce his unique work. I have much admiration for such artists... so yeah great 'm.o.' imo lol!|`|48df0ea585c1658be36a46553408d993aa	I think it's a tad bit strange, but look at the results! Amazing music... <br>  <br>  And... what musicianship to be able to play enough instruments well enough to do something like that, not to mention the writing ~ no one to collaborate with, etc.<br>  <br>  The strange part is that you'd have to be quite a loner and into your own head to work this way. Does this surprise anyone who's a fan? I think not. <br>  <br>  I, personally, can't relate, being the "people person" I am... but I'm sure others can, and... it's still produced an amazing body of work. So hey ~ if it works for him, it works for me, 'cause I *loves* me some Trent!!|`|2YHJZwksaa	Looking at his earlier albums compaired to the last 3 releases I would say go back to doing it yourself (if he isn't).

pMDY89KQaa	do you really want to know?<br>  :D<br>  <br>  <br>  It starts out...with 5 geishas in a circle each caressing a black marble surface, then cut to a doll like figure who was on a giant white cloth pattern, her movements were stiff...and manipulated..then she finds something in the cloth and becomes happy.<br>  <br>  then..it cuts to a woman's head that is disconnected from her body, her body is lying on a table. and her limbs and neck are conncected to wires...she awakens and looks around. then it goes to black...<br>  and a samurai is bleeding from the mouth behind a flame.<br>  then it has a really weird weird skinny guy with a face mask thing with holes on it, writhing like a worm...and his eyes were white. he was screaming and writhing........then his face smiles. and flashes of light show a person wearing a gas mask. then the weird guy starts coughing blood or some sort of strange substance. (some other things....happen but cant remember them all.)<br>  then out of the weird guys mouth comes a giant worm. and then another guy pulls out his heart from his chest...it's very vivid.<br>  <br>  then the flashes of light show a theatre.......with weird things happening.<br>  now its back to the geishas this time they have a male in the middle of the black pit........um.....yes...then the theater people start to spin like mechanical dolls. <br>  .the weird guy started to writhe a bit and grope his chest..yadayada.<br>  now the geisha doll that i saw earlier appeared again, and picks some baby heads off a dead tree.|`|WtTUNC8Naa	Everynight that i have my son (since i allow him to spend time with his father, so some nights he spends over at his dad's), i always have some dream about someone trying to take my son. it always involves someone breaking into my house.

qlCHegC5aa	Yes. they do suck more than 98 or 99% of other music acts. Because they: <br>  a. Market themselves as true rock, from the heart, good christian kids, blahblahblah<br>  <br>  and<br>  <br>  b. are everywhere. Other crappy acts at least have the decency to not saturate us with their...crappiness.<br>  <br>  And to answer your main question. <br>  Mostly they know something about music.<br>  They know what sucks.<br>  Mostly.<br>  And they usually offer examples of bands that don't suck.<br>  meaning they know at least something about music.|`|r3vW3zU1aa	I'm definitely not a poser, and Jonas Brother definitely SUCK way more than even 98% of the rest of the rock and metal acts out there.|`|YlCgMDVwaa	That is a lie.

I want three or four chords and the truth. That's not what these self-defeating "indie" bands and so-called "R&B" cookie-cutter singles artists are putting out.<br>  <br>  I will automatically slay the dragon when your band is riding Disney's coattails. Real bands make it in front of any audience. I am open to new music, yet the music I listened to growing up is now called "Geezer" in Rolling Stone. Now you know why I don't subscribe anymore.<br>  <br>  I'm still young and smart. Just not infantile.|`|89xzNpVaaa	No, actually, the people who diss Jonass Bros. are real rock fans,  because most of the people do listen to their crap music. And, just like the first answer, they do bloody suck more than 90% of all music artists.<br>  I think their there is a song of them and called "Hold On", then say about this crap.|`|komayN73aa	if you honestly think 90% of todays music sucks then you really havent looked around have you? theres more out there than whats on mtv and the radio ya kno|`|a984cQjKaa	yeah, and i don't listen to that 90% of sucktastic crap either.

arjB50zBaa	I think that they are all messed up,lol.<br>  With that being said the fab five are absolutely immature,hypocritical, b!tches  who instigate and look like sh!t.<br>  The way Cookie got jumped is ridiculious and I hope she presses charges, Bad girl or not that just aint right.<br>  That Aliea chich is soooo annoying if you ever notice she starts sh!t with mainly Cookie since basically day one and she talks a bunch of crap then acts like she is gonna fight only when someone holds her back. And when someone else does something she just gets a nice hair pulling in....She Sucks and is whack!<br>  Tiffany I think she wanted to be like the girl from last season that left the show early because she was trying to change ( she got a job with Oxygen out of it) and I think that is what Tiff is hoping for but she just really is a ***** and her true colors show.<br>  The new girl, I have nothing to say except for I hope she wakes up and realizes that she is not pretty at all and she is living in a make believe land. <br>  I cant stand Whitney she is just a dumb a** for saying she has morals and then acting that way. If I had to live with her and hear her say something about being from Boston in every sentence I would probably choke her.<br>  Sarah, what can I say besides Whore!<br>  I feel bad for both Ambers but Amber B does talk alot of smack but that is no reason for the way they treat her when they do the same thing.<br>  I think Cookie is the only one I actually like she has stood up for herself and her friend and tried to get along with everyone after all the crap that they have done.....I hope she presses charges.<br>  One last thing, all these girls claim to be bad girls and hard a**es but anytime they have started a fight I have never seen them throw a punch, its all about hair pulling and kicking.....So what makes them bad a**es?  I think look more like dumb a**es!|`|0ebeadfc05507c25a34209b1ae74798aaa	The WHACK 5 need to get their a$$ beat. They are so fake. If I was on that show I would have whoop all their a$$es specialy that fake a$$ ****** Aleya always talking **** but she ain't about to do nothing. REAL BITCHES DO ONE ON ONE FIGHT not no damn group tryna jump people.They always attacking the Ambers. if it was the Ambers who threw their clothes out it would have been war. I am sooooo disappointed in Tiff, she was my fav on the show and now she acting real stupid. I'm soo mad at her and her a$$ needs to go to jail and I hope Amber M press charges.|`|4hnMSeotaa	I hope so, the F**ked up Five need to grow up. They are exactly EVERYTHING they accuse the Ambers of being. The point of the show is to change yourself. hmmmm seems to me the only one really trying to do that is Amber (Cookie) M.|`|a1d7539ac2479c53542542eef301b5dbaa	I normally watch that show because of the fighting!!!!<br>  But how they jumped that girl was wrong that Ailea and whitney girl needs to go to prison.|`|FSoNujAaaa	omg i love that show i really dont like the new girl she such a b**** but i didnt see it last night im watch it today|`|2FNfyxVqaa	I use to like the Fab 5 but in the last two episodes I really do think they are just being big bullies and letting the Ambers get to them for no reason. Yes, I do think the Ambers are SUPER annoying but it is a double standard when it comes to if the Fab five do something and if the Ambers do it it would go to a whole other level. I think they are letting their egos get to them and the fact that they outnumber the Ambers.<br>  <br>  Ailea is the worst of all. She is a little punk that only suddenly gets big because she has the girls on her back. I can't stand her. She is a punk, and fake. She wants everyone to think she's some "BAD girl when the only thing she's bad at is men."<br>  <br>  Ashley. When did she get involved in this whole battle? She needs to stay out of it. <br>  <br>  Sara, she's whatever. <br>  <br>  Tiffani, I am so disappointed in her!! She use to be my favorite Bad Girl but now she's acting really immature. She's obviously the leader of the Fab Five so she's letting it get to her head.<br>  <br>  I really don't think thought that any of them will have to leave the show. The show ends I do believe in like two weeks because Oxygen network has a new show starting at that time slot, so it'll be pointless for them to get kicked. My guess is that the producers will step in and say bla bla bla you can't fight...they might get kicked out and they will end up ending the show all "DRAMATICALLY"|`|TiS89hj1aa	I love the show I watch it every week.  I think the ambers are hilarious especially cookie.  I only like 2 people out of the fab 5 and thats Tiffany and Sarah the other 3 are trouble makers and drama queens.  I think that Aliea and Whitney are going to get kicked of the show tiffany had nothing to do with that fight and was only trying to break it up.

531f08d2bae7afb19dbace61520eb62caa	The easiest answer is that astrology is worthless bigotry. Or somebody forgot to tell them those "facts". Some you can't know when the are born. Like Genghis Khan.<br>  <br>  Both were talented generals and had great loyalty from their soldiers.<br>  <br>  In Alexander's time superstition was widespread. They favored soothsayers and other seers (Oracle of Delphi for example) that performed assorted divination. See link. Possibly astrology was part of it but they looked for signs.<br>  <br>  Even in Caesar's time (hundreds of years later) the same can be said. In Shakespeare's play you have many references to signs and the famed "Beware The Ides of March". Astrology has a place here too. "The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, But in ourselves, that we are underlings."<br>  <br>  Of course some historical reading is recommended instead of speculating. I'm sure you will find that great conquerors are in all the signs.|`|wBTX8lA6aa	alexander the great was a cancer/leo cusp. dont know if julius was,but me being a cancer/leo cusp i find that my leo sign helps me get over the shy sensative side to me,plus cancer is a cardinal sign meaning very competative and manipulative.<br>  <br>  and just look up the description of a cancer/leo cusp and ull see why he was THE GREAT|`|rAD0mL7Saa	they didn't. they actually are very Cancer in nature. Cancer's often hide their sensitive nature beneath a shell. It's a cardinal sign which means it is outgoing. The water element adds emotional aspect to what they do. Both relied pretty heavily on their intuition. I have never in my life met a timid shy Cancer.|`|LRvaTQ9Yaa	wow im a cancer too, its good to knw that they were also cancerians|`|IqqaA2wIaa	wow thats interesting....maybe they had scorpio rising like me...It gives me alot of determination..|`|VHxZuaOfaa	because Cancer is a cardinal sign which makes them great leader cardinals are born leader, they probably had a lot of cardinal signs like Capricorn, Libra, Aries, and Cancer

kZeu2Dyzaa	No. I'm pretty sure that she is a real person and not an image symbolizing anything.|`|562qoBUUaa	I do think so. She's a fresh personality in the position of First Lady, she's got an awesome fashion style, and she's smart, witty, and absolutely beautiful.  She represents a new idea of what the First Lady is about!
b6Y3sFjsaa	It sounds to me that it's about self appraisal and enlightenment from from said self searching. Interesting use of visual imagery and emotional states without using worn out old cliches.

eKVVf0rXaa	First off I'm so mad at ABC Family for not renewing the show. I've been hooked since the first season. And the way the show was going, it could have had another season or 2.<br>  <br>  But I think the show will end with Kyle telling Amanda everything because she saw that tattoo on Nate's arm and will tell Kyles about it.<br>  As far as who Kyle will end up with, I'm not sure. I would have said Jessi, but the Mrs. T caught them kissing-on purpose, and I don't think she wants to "hormonally infused" teenagers living together.<br>  <br>  But I guess: Jessie and Kyle <br>  (even though i'm still an Amanda fan)

But clearly, this song has something to do with Jesus and Mary Magdalene.  Personally, I'm more interested in The Jesus and Mary Chain, but that's a whole other story.<br>  <br>  Also interesting to note that Tori's parents were missionaries way back when so this might have something to do with her formative years.

BUT I would not do anything frivolous and just for pleasure. Like if he ever (which he would never) suggested a threesome, I wouldn't be like, "oh okay honey, because I love you, you can have anything you want!" but if he needed something and it was a matter of life, death, safety, support, I would do anything for him.|`|DsFFjBtOaa	i would for my old bf but i wouldnt have now knowing he dumped me for another girl who he thought was prettier than me. so the only reason he liked me was that i was pretty. but now we are best friends and i would rather that than anything. but to tell you the truth i don't think that other girl was really that pretty. and she is way to tall for him.<br>  <br>  BrIaNnE|`|K70Hkq5haa	Anything within reason.

O9obQqVvaa	no its not you, i really enjoyed it! i thought it was fab when kevin costner swam underneath the sea and you could see all the old ruins of the cities i think it just got a bad name as it wasnt a box office success and as you say was over budget and lost a load of cash. good show though!|`|aIakDSstaa	I liked it|`|9CHjZ8sBaa	II reckon your opinion and public opinion as a whole is the determining factor of whether a film is a success or not, and not box office sales.<br>  <br>  Yes Waterworld wasnt half-bad. Could have made some improvements but still pretty good|`|b9wICW1Paa	I enjoyed it as well - very entertaining.  It had a bit of campiness to it, but I've always enjoyed such films.  <br>  <br>  A very unusual role for Kevin Costner.  And who doesn't love a typical over-the-top scenery chewing performance from Dennis Hopper?  Just because a movie tanks at the U.S. box office and is generally panned by critics doesn't mean it can't be good times around the popcorn bowl.  It certainly was a polished film and didn't have the common complaint of a low budget.|`|432d817139a5e0be18e400a33e0e1908aa	IMHO, it is good entertainment, which is all you can ask from a movie.<br>  <br>  It wasn't a financial flop either - OK, it cost a whopping $175 million and was the most expensive movie until "Titanic", but it earned $225 million dollars.|`|EeGgovyCaa	I thought it was good too. I enjoyed it. I wouldn't buy it, but if it came on t.v I'd watch it.|`|AA10744842	to me hun ,it is really bad movie. why do they make if it was so bad?|`|f2b0c95be6bed0d2e964518f2320d323aa	i agree it wasn't that bad, but when it was made it was the most expensive film made to date, and i suppose the end product didn't meet the input|`|AA11742440	I found it enjoyable but a little silly. I did buy it on video, but haven't watched it now in a few years and probably won't replace on DVD (or blu-ray or whatever is coming next.)|`|xDfPtDboaa	it wasn't as bad as say " Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-O-Rama"|`|bd55bbe169d91db5d80a19a3cfb1c094aa	I never take any notice of film critics I decide for myself and quite enjoyed it.|`|9ebe04169d04d9c952a946440b3ad139aa	I really liked it, I don't know why it was slated at the time, I've seen much worse movies since!|`|nolrBfNZaa	of course it was good<br>  mr costner hasn't made a bad film|`|zovrJ0yXaa	there are far far worse movies out there. its better than any of the saw movies for one thing|`|FyAHNpQbaa	i enjoyed it aswell.|`|WUnBv5Nvaa	I agree Waterworld was an okay film, on reflection that film was ahead of its time considering the current world climate.

RfNatZogaa	metal  is characterized by its heavy sounds that is a crunchy, bass-heavy feel, and you really can't define metal because metal has allot of different sounds both vocally and musically<br>  <br>  on the other hand metalcore is easier to define because is is more specific. metalcore bands do allot more growling than singing some metalcore bands also have screamers. singing is still included in a lot of metalcore|`|abd8afd4f37f3b93deb9751c1b21750daa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNSOWaKL-ug" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNSOWaKL-...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStbvslOxCo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStbvslOx...</a><br>  <br>  you compare<br>  <br>  the first link is for metal songs<br>  and the 2nd link is for metal core songs..<br>  <br>  <br>  hope i helped;)|`|NGHdmQwoaa	Metal music is pure rock<br>  metalcore is fusion (mix of punk/rock its more intense)|`|fkG4cflhaa	Metal music<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal...</a><br>  <br>  Metalcore music<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalcore" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalcore</a>
OgkGsCkvaa	Somewhat.  Now the TV station started in 1981 witj 24/7 music.  In 1999 there were shows like Real World and Road Rules. But they still had video blocks and top 20 video shows.|`|L94XXSO5aa	More than there is now, but hardly any.  They launched MTV2 in 1996 after all of the complaints about there being no music on MTV anymore and said that was to be all music, which did not last long and had almost no music at all after a year or two.  MTV started doing the reality tv thing with The Real World in 1992 and when that succeeded the music started going away quickly.<br>  <br>  edited for clarity|`|zcGLGPGsaa	i think so because i was young then and remember watching music videos before school.<br>  i dont think all those reality shows started till late 2000|`|o5rfI7oUaa	Music television aka mtv|`|iWUAWkNNaa	Some, that's when 'reality shows' started popping up though.|`|XZS5XeK9aa	mtv was made for music

J5zj8dWRaa	(I feel like I'm back in grade school.)<br>  <br>  Mom - It took 13 years of night classes, but she got her college degree.  She had the courage to go back to work after being a stay-at-home Mom for roughly 20 years, while raising 6 kids and serenely dealing with whatever we threw at her and not letting us get away with anything.  : )  She's a breast cancer survivor (9 years now?).  She didn't let it get her down (too badly) even though 2 close family members died of the same thing.  She's dealt with quite a lot in life, but continues on without (too much) complaining...

5c32c20454730c4d102bcfbf98334674aa	She is a sup nice woman, but I do think she had some major Botox and/or BAD plastic surgery. The botox is obvious because she has no expression lines on her face. She is only in her early-30's so I can't believe she has had so much work done. I think she would be much prettier if she looked more natural, without all the makeup.|`|NqcnAnC1aa	Yeah, she was a little weird looking...obviously has had too much work done.  But she is definitely a very sweet girl.  I liked watching her on the show.|`|g5RS83paaa	yes, I think she was botoxed. Have you seen Melissa Rivers? she's starting to look like she's had too much plastic surgery|`|6LxXR61Waa	I know what you're saying. I think she wore way too much make-up and probably had plastic surgery, although it's hard to tell (for me).  She has such a nice personality though.

Dy14VNebaa	yeah i like bloom because shes pretty, mature and responsible!|`|01dfmIjPaa	no actually, my fave is Stella. She's really pretty and cool and she's all about fashion! and sometimes she comes off a bit rude, but she really does care for her friends and at the end of the day, that's what really matters. plus i think her Power of Solaria is pretty cool =)<br>  <br>  Fairy-wise, it's Stella. Witch-wise, it's Icy. I've just always liked her the best out of all the characters on the show since I first watched Winx Club when i was 8!!! I like Icy because she's beautiful, powerful and she's a good leader of her friends, plus she never gives up. She's been defeated 3 years and still, she hasn't given up! =)|`|Nw0FOBFEaa	Ahh, I used to watch the winx club when i was younger but i don't anymore but i remembered that my favorite Charrie was Stella because she had a bad childhood but she was still strong and she restored power to her country and became princess again.|`|BIyJUmM9aa	ugh, no, I hated her when I used to watch it.<br>  I hated that she was all the show was about when their were 5 other girls.<br>  My favorite was Winx girlwas Stella

7R1cVdYIaa	I feel the same way!<br>  My ex boyfriend is a Virgo and he was very irritating when he thought I was purposely trying to make him jealous!<br>  To this day, he calls me and acts like if we're still together and gets bothered if I tell him I'm going to hang out with friends... <br>  Btw, I'm a Scorpio and I'll admit I would be vengenful when I was younger, like in grade school...Now, I could care less! lol|`|BBSRuyNfaa	lol i wouldn say more revengeful because IMO a scorpio is going to get you back no matter what, not so with a virgo, we'll only get you back if we feel it is justified or if we feel you are insulting our intelligence(playing us for a fool)<br>  <br>  The difference between our revenge and a scorpios is that a scorpio's revenge is more typical of most ppl, irrational based off emotion, a virgo will plot and plot the best way to really hurt you and carry out the plan like its the next mission impossible:-)<br>  <br>  Virgo who has tired of the need for revenge, i just get rid of losers now....|`|b25065caf34b81dfca3b01c2d8cc99aaaa	So I am guessing you had a bad experience with a Virgo.

So if it's getting to you...then we done our jobs cause that's exactly the response we want.|`|QZzQdh43aa	mm, i'm a scorpio who had a virgo best friend. i'll tell ya, he was a really violent and vengeful kind of guy. he always seemed to be having some kind of grudge or anger issues. he blackmailed me once just because he thought i was being fake with pictures of things i liked on my myspace, but i forgave him. they can be pretty volcanic|`|AWC9OcQ4aa	No im a virgo and i deffinatly know if theres a problem i either let it go or do the same back to someone else and not in a cheap way and it's your own personal experience with THAT PERSON ! not virgos but with that person.<br>  <br>  and i've have had problems with people and mostly capricorns and i dont blame on the capricorn sign itself so.|`|L39mQJYJaa	Which signs you find annoying is hugely personal, I for an example don't find Scorpios or Virgos annoying. But I do find Gemini very disturbing. So it's impossible to say which is the most annoying!<br>  <br>  My top 3 list of annoying signs would be Gemini, Sagitaurus, Cancer|`|69PoS4sIaa	i dont know about that but i really dont get along with virgos <br>  always trying to correct you <br>  when people really dont give a ****|`|B7WIZdglaa	YES! You're absoutely right. Long story short- I dated this guy for 4 years.. and ended up breaking up w/me and started dating this virgo girl. Ok, at first I WAS immature and spiteful and I did screw w/her a little but... but that was over 3 years ago. I'm sooo over it now, and to this day- she still talks crap about me and tries to screw with me in one way or another.

However, some people consider text language rude, tacky or a sign of someone who can't spell. Others don't understand it. You really wouldn't get as many responses. So any type of internet slang from lolspeak to text to leet should be used sparingly, if at all, if it's important to you to be understood. Same goes for some of the internet acronyms. I've bumped into people who didn't know what "roflmao" or "lol" meant.

Well, to be honest, Left 4 Dead and 28 Days Later have the zombie idea down better than most every other zombie thing out there... thing is, zombies couldn't be literally "walking corpses", they would be some kind of infection that decays parts of the brain causing the human to see any moving, living creature as it's prey, and remove the logic to plot out a strategical attack against it... causing the "zombie" to sprint at whatever the victim is, with no caution to consequence, and devour it.<br>  <br>  What's the chance? Really, really low. A disease like that, completely unnatural (it's never happened before, has it?) would have had to be caused by humans... if scientists wanted to create a "zombie", they could sit in a lab for years with hundreds of human test subjects and eliminate key parts of the brain until the subject acts like a zombie from Left 4 Dead... but nobody has the time, the patience, or the freedom to do something like that. Plus, it has no benefit. If someone tried to create a cure and a "zombie" was the side effect... the cure/vaccination would be so intricate, it wouldn't be possible to create for hundreds of years.<br>  <br>  So to be perfectly honest, a zombie apocalypse couldn't happen for... at least a long time. But, I hope you see, that it is completely possible.<br>  Source(s):<br>  Hey, email me sometime if you like talking about this kind of stuff... tell me what you'd do in a zombie apocalypse.|`|nGNJFyGXaa	walking maggot farms|`|XTWClFLQaa	No dude no...|`|RJblCWqXaa	yes if u touch urself long enough u might summon them|`|IkWcwsj8aa	no. if u dead u dead|`|46a14ceb5e21165137def6a6f8a9df2eaa	By scientists resolving the problem of keeping the brain alive after death then it will be possible.

aKBqMLuhaa	<- Old school Phish fan before they began selling out stadiums in a manner of minutes. I saw them go from a 4,000  Expo to the 14,000 seat Boston Garden in less than 6 months.<br>  <br>  I miss the small intimate shows that had a lot more freedom for exploring the music and expanding their talents on stage. I miss not being able to smoke up the band behind The Stone Church and the Portsmouth Music Hall. I miss not having to worry or stress about weather or not I can obtain tickets to the shows; (that is the biggest downside) and the fact that they tour nationally which cuts down on the amount of times and number of shows they play in N.E. I went from seeing about 10 shows (or multi night stints) (and did some full tours as well) each year to about 3. Also the quality of the kind of people at the shows has gone down hill.<br>  <br>  But I don't let these things get to me anymore. I am there for the music not the people. I am happy for the band to have the mass success that they have had; and (IMHO) they deserve. And if I was going to that many concerts still, I'd have to give up my day job and go back on tour full time selling whatever I could for gas money. I'm too old to do that anymore (unless I had an RV!lol). Now that they are huge they have all kinds of musical doors open to them and I am glad that they are doing what they want. <br>  <br>  I felt the sting of this mainstreaming pretty hard at first, but I had a epiphany and saw things from their view; while my friends were still stewing over thier new found mainstream success, which they were not happy about. I think some of them are still pissy about it, they no longer go to shows.<br>  BTW: Phish still doesn't do music videos and stuff like that, but now I wouldn't mind if they did.|`|d02c709e184c7a1f7828d9e3e00c32b4aa	You're correct in that things are never quite that simplistic.  It would be greatly inaccurate for me to say I hate all music that conforms to the mainstream.  There are some good bands out there that have managed to get famous along the way.  However, there's no denying the sellout factor which likely accounts for the times you hear your quoted statement from above.  You'd be surprised in that the bands actually have more control than you think in terms of being mainstream or not.  They are often like advertisers, trying to maximize profits as well as reach a target audience.  Every so often, you'll get a single like Closer where the artist clearly didn't give a rat's a** about moving units and it ends up reaching the Top 40 in spite of it all.  But this doesn't happen often.<br>  <br>  My opinion?  I try to avoid it overall because many of the bands and their particular styles are excruciatingly boring and painful to endure.  And don't even get me started on radio in the modern age.|`|pTrJ00x3aa	Not necessarily.  When they talk about that they typically mean they signed to a major record label.  You find that phrase a lot with punk bands, because their following are the people who are "anti-cool" but what grates at me is that they're all the same within their little sub-culture.  But whatever, the band is the their career, to stay on a minor label to me is like working at McDonald's and someone offers you a job as a CEO of a fortune 500 company and you're like, "Naw, I am happy where I am at."  It's their job, they should make the best of it.<br>  <br>  Now as for me, when a song goes mainstream I kind of lose interest in it because it is played out the wazoo and every polo wearing prep is singing it.  Kind of loses its novelty.|`|8Rwjvzhbaa	For whatever reason, these days it tends to be pretty dull, uninteresting stuff.    Honestly, how long can the public remain interested in dumbed down rehashes of stuff thats been done better before?  This wasn't always the case- the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, etc. were arguably mainstream, in the sense that they were extremely popular and everybody knew about them, but they were also excellent.  Is it a case of the record companies interfering more with bands creativity, or demanding something thats dumbed down and predictable enough that they know it will sell? Or is it a creative dry spell in rock in general, or a case of the more creative bands going in directions that appeal only to a minority?|`|bJn83u7Oaa	I hate when a band changes its sound.  Green Day, for example, became very pop-rock with American Idiot and got away from what made them famous because the new sound is easier to play.<br>  <br>  Good Charlotte also did it with their new CD Good Morning Revival.  They turned into bunch of wanna be gangsters and completely changed from what made them famous on Young and Hopeless.<br>  <br>  I was a fan of both of these bands before they were really famous.  I don't listen to any Green Day newer than the Warning CD and I don't listen to any GC that's on Good Morning Revival and won't listen to any more GC until they go back to what got them to where they are now.  I understand that music changes with time, but if it worked well enough to make you famous, it should still work now and the loyal fans will always be fans.  To me its not a matter of "Going Mainstream" because that just means that they're songs are popular.  To me, its more of a matter of selling out on your old, popular sound for what sounds good now, leaving all of your old fans wondering why you betrayed them.|`|ef4fdcd84e60e1dac24728288eab23faaa	It dosent bother me if bands go mainstream, if a band is awesome, a band is awesome regardless of how popular they get. What annoys me is when a band changes their image and starts to produce sh1t the more commercialised they get. Classic examples are Dimmu Borgir & Cradle of Filth, both gone extremely flamboyant in recent years.|`|XfCGzHeTaa	People want to feel that they are the reference on a group. When a band goes mainstream, there is no mystery left. You either like them or you don't. When a group is still underground per say, people feel that they know more than you about something.<br>  <br>  Bob to Bill - <br>  <br>  Bob: "Have you heard the new Kerli song (Walking on Air)?"<br>           <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN1oOKD2qsQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN1oOKD2q...</a><br>  Bill: "No, what kind of music does Kerli sing"<br>  Bob: "It's a new techno / Bjork / Pop song"<br>  Bill: " I'll have to check it out"<br>  Bob: "It's pretty catchy and the chick is hot"<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  Bob "Have you heard the new AC/DC album"<br>  Bill "There old"<br>  Bob "There still pretty good"<br>  <br>  (Bill already knows if he likes AC/DC) no mystery left in Bob's music choice.<br>  <br>  I noticed that 80% or more music people are blasting in their cars I haven't heard before and I listen to the radio. <br>  <br>  But I to try to listen to music that's not so main stream.

QZzQdh43aa	Noisy, tense or crowded situations are no good if you have to concentrate between January and March. Working with like-minded people who share the same goal is the best solution. If there is any research to be done, you could find some useful sites on the Internet when other resources fail to provide the information you need.<br>  <br>  What's in Store for Cancer 2009<br>  Another important feature in the skies during February and March is Mars travelling through the finance sector of your chart. Money will be an iffy subject when one minute you seem to be in the money while at other times heavy demands will make quite a dint in your income.<br>  <br>  Also, if you step on someone's toes when discussing or dealing with financial affairs, they will only walk bitterly away. If you need anyone's support or co-operation, treat them with respect and your politeness will pay dividends.<br>  <br>  Cancer’s Forecasts for Mid-2009<br>  Emphasis is on the social sector of your chart mid-2009. This suggests new depths of insight will enhance a friendship or close relationship. It will be easier to get along with people once you understand what makes them tick. You will also have more control over future events by planning ahead and talking plans through with others.<br>  <br>  From mid-June the Sun will be in your sign. In September, Mars is in Cancer. During these months, the willingness to take each moment as it comes means you'll accept the rough with the smooth.<br>  <br>  An extra imaginative outlook and breadth of vision will help you see the potential of opportunities that other people have turned down. Therefore during the middle of the year, no-one and nothing can stop you from pursuing new quests.<br>  <br>  You will say 'yes' to something you would never have thought to agree to in the past. Even if there's some risk involved and someone accuses you of sticking your neck out, if it's what you really want to do, go for it.<br>  <br>  Cancer’s Forecasts for the End of 2009<br>  During the last quarter of the year you will be in just the right mood to get through an amazing number of jobs about the house. You will know what needs to be done but especially if you are a Cancerian student, your flatmates are unlikely to help. Instead, roll up your sleeves and do it yourself.<br>  <br>  Also in the autumn, there is a note of caution that suggests you should not gamble with love or money. Play it safe and relationships will be cemented, not severed. Coupledom brings companionship and admittedly, romance is more cosy than inspiring but this will suit your mood perfectly now.<br>  <br>  Now if, at any time during the year, people interfered too much in your personal business, by November you will be determined to seek independence. Some things are best left unspoken but not so as 2009 ends. With gentle insistence, you will make your mark. Cancer, people will genuinely take what you say very seriously.|`|DbNbWQflaa	will get stronger and rock the world with their mistique, people wont totally understand what is happening with you . they will just think its a looney phase , so keep it to yourself,

cr5TQgmUaa	Spacey is unmarried and vehemently protects his private life, about which very little is known. This generated tabloid press rumors that he might be gay; however, Spacey has repeatedly denied them over the years, for example in Playboy (October 1999), in The Sunday Times Magazine (December 19, 1999) and implicitly in Gotham Magazine (May 2007). <br>  <br>  Moreover, April Winchell revealed, in broadcasts of her KFI show, on her web diary and several other websites, that she and Spacey dated for a while after high school, during a run of the musical Gypsy, and later went to New York together. She and Spacey have remained friends. Between 1992 and 2000, Spacey discreetly dated Dianne Dreyer, script supervisor to Anthony Minghella, M. Night Shyamalan and Sydney Pollack.<br>  <br>  Although Joel Schumacher is gay, why does that have any implication on Colin Farrell? <br>  <br>  Colin Farrell "made his name" on his own.

6dAsdiA5aa	<> Karin<br>  <br>  Seeing how these animes are both contain vampire, the theme of the animes is to break down the wall between humans and vampires. Both animes also involves school life and daily activities. There is some comedy and love interest involved in both animes so if you like Karin, you will like Vampire Knight... <br>  <br>  <> Trinity Blood <br>  <br>  Both have "vampires among vampires'<br>  <br>  <> Blood+ <br>  <br>  it is a vampire anime in a way but a similarity is that the main character wants to be as normal as possible.............can't say much or it might ruin the surprise.<br>  <br>  <br>  <> Fruits Basket <br>  <br>  The characters in VK and Fruits Basket seem similar.<br>  <br>  Both Tohru and Yuuki start out innocent to what's really going on around them, but as the storyline unfolds, both are determined to do whatever they can to help with the situation. (Both characters also have the same voice actor.)<br>  <br>  Also, Kyo and Zero both have the anti-social, trying to be a tough guy and deal with my problems all by myself thing going on. <br>  <br>  <br>  <> Rosario + Vampire <br>  <br>  Both are about Vampires, Rosario + Vampire has more comedy aspects where as Vampire Knight is more serious. <br>  <br>  <> Shingetsutan Tsukihime <br>  Also about vampires and the differences between life and death and how fragile a human life can really be. <br>  <br>  <br>  <> Chrno Crusade <br>  These two great stories share many similarities - supernatural aspect, some comedy, romance, dark atmosphere, and two great stories.<br>  <br>  <> Ayashi no Ceres <br>  These two great stories both offer supernatural, love-triangles and drama. VK is lighter, but has a somewhat similar mood to Ayashi... <br>  <br>  <br>  <> Ghost Hunt <br>  Yuki and Mai do look alike. If you want an in depth angle of Mai and kazuya relationship, watch Vampire Knight, and you'll see what i mean. <br>  <br>  <br>  <> Shugo Chara! <br>  Ok before you call me crazy....trust me for some reason a LOT of people who like one of these like the other. They are not very similar in plot, except I guess with the love triangles you could make<br>  Amu=Yuuki <br>  Tadase=Kaname <br>  Ikuto=Zero<br>  Except Vampire Knight's tones are a lot darker than Shugo Chara's. <br>  <br>  <br>  <> Special A<br>  vampire knight and special A revolve around elite high school kids with the plot focused on romance and comedy<br>  both are reli good anime<br>  <br>  <br>  <> Shakugan no Shana <br>  VK is darker than Shana, but both series have supernatural, action and romance and school-life aspects that will keep you hooked until you get to the last episode! <br>  <br>  <br>  <> Basilisk: Kouga Ninpou Chou<br>   <br>  Both are love stories with a sad atmosphere.

I was only 11 ( thats 1 I can remember ( cant remember the ones b4 )<br>  <br>  FIRST WEIRD KISS - A cute guy I liked ( yr or 2 later  Dropped me home we was outside nd itgot late he said he had to go took mi face in his hands nd kissed me nd RAN !!! down the road nd round teh corner LoooL !!!

Well... it's technically multiple, but let me explain.<br>  <br>  My first kiss was because I was Juliet in the school play.

Well when I pulled back I was horrified to find I had kissed a very ugly toad. Needless to say I ran to the bathroom with all my friends and he waited outside the door trying to get my phone number. My friend finally lied and told him I was sick and they hustled me out of there. I never lived that one down.<br>  <br>  That was my first kiss too btw...
rNmekxLcaa	Who cares?|`|NqcnAnC1aa	I don't know what to believe at this point.  It could all just be some weird publicity stunt...but then again, why would he want to ruin his career??  Maybe they have some sort of weird comeback planned...or they'll send him to rehab so that we think he's all better and then he can restart his music career.  I don't know.  Celebrity scandals seem to be the "it" thing these days.|`|zQcOmhjiaa	reseto i wish u would fite chris brown so he could woop yo ***|`|4472d6c8b8a41746c6129264601312c7aa	If he did, he should be punished but I don't think his career as an artist has very much to do with it. So people shouldn't ban his music when in fact they really like it.|`|sVFtRGBhaa	Yes.<br>  No.<br>  Possibly.|`|b25065caf34b81dfca3b01c2d8cc99aaaa	Yes. He never admitted he didn't. Woman beater!!!|`|w1OG27LHaa	i think he did. i am actaully so shocked that he would do that!<br>  but we never know what happens behind closed doors....'|`|KCpGsN2faa	I think yes, he did. Too much evidence agains him. I would so leave him, I don't know if she will, cuz women in those relationships rarely do, but then again, she ha always come across as a really strong women. I hope and think yes, he will lose his career cuz he has built it up as a sweet, caring, sensitive guy, obviously he is NOT.  America loaths abusive boyfriends and also he beat Rihanna up, everyone freakin loves her.|`|FRMhzFQyaa	he admitted he did,<br>  & rihanna even said she misses chris and is thinking of taking him back.<br>  hes not going to lose his entire career, just a majority of his fans and possibly his record label.|`|AA10236778	Yes he hit her, he admitted it.<br>  No she shouldn't stay with him and get beat up again, are you stupid? No he won't lose his career, it will boost it in certain circles.|`|kqfxu5xfaa	when I first heard this I said, "Are you sure Rihanna didn't beat him up?" I just can't imaging Chris Brown inflicting pain on another individual.|`|gBR5s0f9aa	He deff hit her, & there's a big chance he could loos his career. Radio stations even stop playing his music, & Rihanna would be so dumb to go back wit him.. i really hope she doesnt.|`|8os6wuQLaa	yes. He admitted to it|`|jNHgmIUxaa	yea, i can see him doing it even though it's hard to believe|`|6f758faf93c707c104fe0a2c9b0f855aaa	Yes, he admitted to it. Google "rihanna face." I think that they should let me fight him and we'll see how tough he is when he's fighting a full grown man. I really hate dudes who hit women.|`|yLOsXWmnaa	Yes<br>  No<br>  If he does thats on him
vVka4ZA0aa	They covered the Green Goblin, they covered Doc Oct, and they covered Venom. They'll probably do Harry as the Green Goblin next.<br>  <br>  But the Spiderman movies are horrible and do no justice to Spiderman. <br>  I've read a lot of Spiderman comics, and I have lots of pet peeves about the movie... Like, Spiderman's web shooters were created by him because he's a f@#$ing genius. The over acting is just way too much. And Spiderman NEVER EVER takes his mask off in front of people, except in Civil War, but we all know how that ended.<br>  <br>  In short, the Spiderman movies suck and will only do the MAIN villians like Venom and The Rhino.|`|X45rxI7gaa	Who cares? the Spiderman movies were very corny, and so stupid, honestly those movies are for little kids, and the acting and costumes are atrocious. Spiderman movies can rot in hell and anyone involved in them

ITV will probably show season 3 in the New Year of 2010 (if they haven't gone bust).  <br>  <br>  I read that the show had been recommissioned for, I think, another two series and (if I was the kind of person who downloaded american shows illegally) am/would be looking forward to Season 4 in October.  <br>  <br>  Thought Season 3 was the best so far  :)|`|FEOGM9l9aa	Once in a while on sundays...It's quite rare

Herbie Hancock also has crossover appeal. Flora Purim is cool and Peggy Lee did some disco, after a long career in jazz. You need some transition type songs, ie r&b , pop, disco to jazz.

xhqKLSwCaa	It started because of a girl <br>  Of all wars of history and pre-history, of fact or fancy, the Trojan War is the most famous. The historical event has captured the imaginations of poets and storytellers century after century, and each teller had added something to the tale. Often the accounts given were extremely distorted, often with little or no attention paid to the actual history of the occurrence. The account given in Homer’s Iliad of the Trojan War is a masterpiece, of both mythological fiction and historical accuracy. In this work, many details of the war can be found, represented with astonishing accuracy. Because of their intertwining with myth, however, it is necessary to understand the nature and brief history of the main characters found in it. Several of these, such as Helen and Priam, were actual historical figures, merely enlarged and given grandeur by Homer.<br>  <br>  The Trojan War provides the background for much of both Greek and Roman literature. When Paris handed Aphrodite the prize, the apple of discord, he started the series of events that led to the destruction of his homeland Troy, which, in turn, led to the flight of Aeneas and the founding of Troy. On the Greek side, the Trojan War led to the murder of his daughter Electra by Agamemnon, his own murder at the hands of his wife, Clytemnestra (Helen of Troy's sister), and her murder at the hands of her son.<br>  Unravel these twisted threads with the articles on the Trojan War.|`|8n3NvYQwaa	I think too, by cracker nacker...

a7e4055c3932269f4df1fb95325983ffaa	INteresting question.<br>  <br>  I once worked with a lady who was ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS.  Her name was Bonnie.  Bonnie was treated well by everyone who knew her.  She had confidence and literally brightened up a room when she walked into it.  She has men constantly falling over themselves just to be near her and ALWAYS has dates.<br>  <br>  One day I actually took a good look at Bonnie and noticed that she really was not particularly attractive -- in fact, she was quite homely, but Bonnie ACTED beautiful.  Her confidence, posture and genuine sweetness made Bonnie beautiful.  It had nothing to do with her outward looks.  It had EVERYTHING to do with how she acted.<br>  <br>  What I found about my own beauty is when I when I was younger, I had it and didn't know it.

In this regard, some Geminis also are compatible with Aries.  <br>  <br>  If you want to find out your natal chart or the natal chart of others:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://astro.cafeastrology.com/cgi-bin/astro/natal" rel="nofollow">http://astro.cafeastrology.com/cgi-bin/a...</a><br>  <br>  And if you want to compare your signs to their signs:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cafeastrology.com/articles/signcompatiblitygrid.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cafeastrology.com/articles/si...</a><br>  <br>  :P|`|nxHjSKTTaa	satan.|`|0l88fiUTaa	libra, aquarius, aries, and I think leo too...|`|0jlG2clBaa	<a href="http://www.buzzle.com/articles/which-signs-are-compatible-with-gemini.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.buzzle.com/articles/which-sig...</a>|`|0imjbygmaa	idk why don't you to the astrology part of yahoo and find out<br>  <br>  all i know is gemini's are twins|`|jCeylLsIaa	Aquarians|`|g8QMrSzwaa	aqua|`|L39mQJYJaa	The best sign for Gemini is probably not their other half, which would be Libra. I think that 2 Air signs or 2 water signs or whatever can't have the best potential, They may understand each other the best, but that doesn't neccecarily mean they will have the best life together! The diversity of a such a relationship would be too low, low diversity means less growth of your consciousness. You will learn and understand yourself and the world much better if you have a relationship with someone who is different from you, Capricorns and Geminis are probably a good combination! They aren't to different from each other but they still have much to give each other! My brother is a Capricorn and he function well with Gemini girls!|`|IuUQHinqaa	libra

9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	Well, Yann Tiersen does not write classical music (although he does write piano music - the two are not necessarily interchangeable). Are you sure it's classical music you're looking for?|`|rNqF4gIVaa	Yann Tiersen is not a classical performer / composer, so I doubt if classical is what you are looking for.|`|eez2gtaLaa	Search for Bryan Pezzone.

ce83aaa18b48dd89e8f2ce5b7f9d7885aa	In that temperature it should be fine. If you are worried, when you get to your bible study take it inside, leave it in the case until right before you need it. That way it will slowly acclimate to the surrounding conditions. But really it should not be a problem at all.|`|KkZE2NDYaa	Just about every guitarist I know has a horror story about their guitar being stolen from a car. At the very least, make sure it can't be seen.|`|6HyFHrfIaa	Yes, be very, VERY careful leaving your guitar in the car. Someone might see it and break in and you'll never get it back. Personally, it has never happened to me (Hope it never does!!). However if you do leave it in the car, make sure you have something covering it for protection (From thieves I mean).<br>  <br>  With temperatures, heat will ruin your strings horribly. Rain, if it seeps through (Especially for acoustic) the neck might not sound as well and your frets will rust off a bit, thus making it more uncomfortable to play.|`|SkRJNhuCaa	heat is the prime enemy, with wild temperature fluctuations coming second.<br>  <br>  With those temps, most likely it won't suffer. Come summer, you'd kill it.<br>  <br>  Of course that's assuming it won't get stolen, a very wild assumption.|`|sJNoTGQVaa	well, your guitar wont get wet when its in the car, though, I had a large acoustic electric that I brought into school before in a solid case, it wasn't that bad|`|lgMshdofaa	YOur guitar should be fine in the car, put it in the trunk so if people look into your car windows they dont see it! and are not tempted to steal it. If your guitar is in the car, it wont get wet. also, if you do carry it around with you, just put it on the floor....it shouldn't be too bad :)<br>  EDIT: I just thought of something else! Leave your guitar with like the principle or something, put it in one room of the school the whole time you are there so when you go to leave, you know exactly where it is.<br>  HAVE FUN LEADING WORSHIP! <br>  I hope this helps, Indy|`|MJR4Om7taa	you should be warey about it getting too cold or hot if it's in the car, changes on temprature can knock the guitar out of tune, but if your not fussed about that (can just re-tune it) it will probably be fine in the car provided it's concealed (so people don't steal it). It shouldn't get warped, it's in a car and a case

V9PXzTGoaa	I still listen to the radio in the car, but that's about it.|`|6f4f7d14ae8b69e50ccaf068c55c7152aa	My radio listening is largely limited to my time in the car.    Being in the New York City area, that can comprise of nearly 3 hours per day (1 1/2 hour commute in each direction).    I do have XM radio, so I listen primarily to satellite radio but my wife listens to OTA radio while driving.   We also listen to radio in the mornings over coffee and breakfast for about 1 hour each morning|`|AA10356243	I still listen to radio as yes it does give me the first taste of music sometimes when I haven't researched every new song coming out but is a great form of relaxation and something to listen to while driving or working.<br>  <br>  I know many people who even with the Ipods and such still listen to radio as it would take either a illegal amount of downloads or thousands of dollars to usually equal the song collection of some radio stations.<br>  <br>  Actually I have a habit of listening to mom and pop radio stations that stream on the web to find a lot of my music (as well as some streaming services such as slacker.com) as most of those stations have a bigger variety of playlists compared to major city stations and will play songs that never get airplay elsewhere|`|3hjGkfOgaa	I listen to the radio in my car all the time.  I my office I use my computer to get a radio feed so I can listen to my favorite station.|`|2LYIMahxaa	I do have the radio on in the car. But it is more of a "white noise," or just a sound to help block the sounds outside. The internet is giving regular radio a slow death.|`|AA10652430	Yes. Music and news.<br>  Also the paranormal (Coast to Coast AM)<br>  And then the enlightening (Roy Masters)|`|qxteTM9Kaa	Yes,Christian radio|`|AA10220379	Well, first off, I listen to the Radio ALL the Time in my Car!<br>  Not as much at Home anymore, though.<br>  <br>  Here's what I think:<br>  <br>  People are not spending as much Time to Listen to Anything, accept when it is Convenient for them. The TV has taken over, and Music is being Replaced with the Evening News, for some people.<br>  <br>  People just don't spend Time to enjoy life, like they Should. They try to make the All Mighty Dollar, and that seems to Control their life.<br>  Personally, I will NEVER let Money control my Life! It only Ruins peoples minds!<br>  <br>  Not that money is evil, or anything. People are just Weak in the head these days. They let Crook's sell them on Spending all their Money, and they end up Broke. So, they end up Chasing the Dollar, too make ends meet. Sometimes not even getting there.<br>  <br>  See, the Radio is Technically part of our Social Lives, and it Keeps us Connected to a certain Broadcast Listening area. It also keeps us sane, and Relieves Stress. It also keeps us Informed, and Knowledgeable about what is Going on around us, that we would Otherwise be Oblivious too.<br>  <br>  Another ingredients in making people Neglect their Radio, is the Media.<br>  Yes, even the Radio is a part of the Media, as it keeps us Informed. But the TV has got us thinking that the Media we hear on the News at night is going to be the Same as what we hear on our Radio the next day.<br>  <br>  While this may be True for those that worship Hollywood, it isn't necessarily true for the Rest of us!<br>  We need to hear Music, and for some reason people don't make it a Priority to Listen to Music, and let their Brain refresh. Instead, they let thier Brain's fry, and get stressed-out. It's a Paradox, cause what Keeps people Sane, is what keeps the News-Media quiet!<br>  And when not enough People listen to Music, they can get Bent out of Shape, do Stupid things, and become a Part of the News!<br>  It happens All the Time!!|`|oDz3Y7mfaa	Yes, but I feel like I'm the only one sometimes. I'm the only person I ever see sporting a Sony Walkman instead of an iPod. <br>  <br>  When I listen to FM radio it's mainly to hear classic rock and soul but a small part of the time it's to hear new music. I don't go to clubs or concerts so it's the only way I hear about new music. I always wear my Walkman to not sit in silence and to block out other noise.|`|AA10182327	I love music and listening to the radio is one way to learn about the new music out there. I listen to my local public radio station(wtmd.org) that plays a lot of GREAT music from the classics to most new stuff before it is popular like Lily Allen, Decemberists, etc. Anyway, I listen to the radio in the car mostly but sometimes at home.|`|On57DVlAaa	I still listen to the radio. I got an iPhone and all, but I barely listen to the iPod part. So I play on an app while I listen to the Radio. Lol. Of course I do. But maybe that's just because I am a huge music lover!|`|M8vxlM6laa	My husband and I both listen to the radio daily.  Our local stations play great music from the past forty years and have news and weather updates, too; which we both like.|`|aHu8QyWmaa	I listen to talk show's all day long.

PS0oSoXFaa	Bach is probably your best bet. His "Toccata and fugue in d minor" is extremely famous and sounds very gothic, probably what you're looking for. I would think almost anything for organ written in a minor key will sound this way.<br>  <br>  You should stick to the Baroque period (1600-1750); pianos weren't invented yet, so music was specifically written with either organ or harpsichord/clavichord in mind. Of course many of these pieces are now played on piano, but still, you're much more likely to find organ from then. Plus Baroque *generally* sounds more "gothic"- thicker and more complex.<br>  <br>  If you don't mind that the organ doesn't stand alone in this piece, Albinoni's "Adagio for Organ and Strings" is beautiful- maybe not quite as gothic but definitely dark and gorgeous|`|vsy4QMHMaa	Oh, god this question is great ...<br>  <br>  My favorite and best source for organ music is (can you believe it?)<br>  <br>  ...

They won't stay in tune, and by the time you pay the shipping you could have bought a better guitar that isn't a rip-off.<br>  <br>  If you want to support those crooks, I suppose that's you're business.  If you want close to the quality but at a lower price, look at Epiphones.  They're designed by Gibson, but made at a lower price.<br>  <br>  If you're just wanting something that looks like a Les Paul, then buy a Harmony or some other off brand.

UpmvmPvNaa	I would definitely recommend trying to find a women's barbershop chorus in your area.  It looks like you may be in the UK and I know there are women's barbershop groups there.  You may be able to find a link to them through www.sweetadelinesintl.org. They would be able to guide you to the right source.  Barbershop singing is not the old fashioned type many think.  It is attracting many more young people and all ages participate.  It is truly the best basic vocal training for the least money that I know of.  And you'll have a blast doing it and make life long friends.  What could be better? <br>  Good luck!

67ea71af780ce95553f2ddb1eddee690aa	Some people say it's a reference to a drug rehab center. Some say it's related to the church of Anton LaVey. Don Henley himself was vague when asked the question years ago. Here's a list of commonly told ideas:<br>  <br>  (1) The Hotel California is a real hotel located in (pick one) Baja California on the coastal highway between Cabo San Lucas and La Paz or else near Santa Barbara. In other words, the song is a hard look at the modern hospitality industry, which is plagued by guests who "check out any time [they] like" but then "never leave." <br>  <br>  (2) The Hotel California is a mental hospital. I see one guy on the Web has identified it as "Camarillo State Hospital in Ventura County between LA and Santa Barbara." <br>  <br>  (3) It's about satanism. Isn't everything? <br>  <br>  (4) Hotel California is a metaphor for cocaine addiction. See "You can check out any time you like but you can never leave." This comes from the published comments of Glenn Frey, one of the coauthors. <br>  <br>  (5) It's about the pitfalls of living in southern California in the 1970s, my interpretation since first listen. Makes perfect sense, and goddammit, who you going to believe, some ignorant rock star or me? <br>  <br>  (6) My fave, posted to the Usenet by Thomas Dzubin of Vancouver, British Columbia: "There was this fireworks factory just three blocks from the Hotel California . . . and it blew up! Big tragedy. One of the workers was named Wurn Snell and he was from the town of Colitas in Greece. One of the workers who escaped the explosion talked to another guy . . . I think it was probably Don Henley . . . and Don asked what the guy saw. The worker said, "Wurn Snell of Colitas .  . . rising up through the air."|`|aeba6e037a143502b35f08cbfbbe27dfaa	i believe it was a reference to the state mental hosp. in camarillo ca.|`|dyBMX1hgaa	i saw it on this one tv show. its about a hotel in california that supposedly has many dark spirits that "checked in" but never left.

The imagery is striking, and it has become woven into the fabric of the culture of Western society.<br>  <br>  Don't mistake references for proselytizing, though.   Slayer use lots of biblical references, and they're not Christians.    U2 has used biblical references, they don't profess to be Christians.

Unless someone is looking specifically for your album most people won't be pulled in by simple album art.

3cae1a173ced8370d2a6d3af83b9b006aa	Yes, they wanted it there.  On the first pressings, it's not a hidden track though, but is the last track.  GnR were at a point in their career at that time they could've released ANY kind of album they wanted which is exactly what they did.  5 years earlier, the record company NEVER would've let them put out an obscure punk covers record like that (remember that's the same year Green Day and so-called new punk invasion began and GnR wanted to pay their respects to these bands and that opened up the doors for Green Day, Offspring, Rancid, etc...  to go mainstream.  fyi  :)
ioNTTqKfaa	about 5 mins<br>  <br>  2: It's a great opportunity for them. Yes, they are well known within the hip hop community but they are still relatively underground and unknown outside of hip hop. I'm down with anything that will get them more attention.<br>  <br>  3: I watched his debut. The opening monologue was alright. The stupid skit was terrible. He needs to work on interviews.|`|bribxhsdaa	Not Long...?uestion confirmed "How I got Over" or "How We Got Over" or some jazz like that.<br>  <br>  2. Any obviously talented band are wasting themselves by being a houseband. How to get yourself noticed as a drummer? Play fills when corny jokes are told -_-. Thank god The Roots are already established.<br>  <br>  3. I have no idea what that is. I'm pretty sure Jimmy Fallon got beaten up by Peter Griffin in an episode of Family Guy once. <br>  <br>  As far as the album, I hope the following things:<br>  <br>  1. ?uestion stays on the kit and nothing else. I don't see the point in a talented drummer relying on drum machine sounds...<br>  2. They use F.Knuckles as part of the rhythm section. His grooves are freaking sweet. <br>  3. Kirk and Biddle play some Solo's/interludes. - Biddle is wicked underrated and I often forget how well Kirk can play a solo. (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D671znPDOCU)" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D671znPDO...</a><br>  4. There are no features...Or if any features, They are like elite features.

Unless Jimmy is a die hard fan, then he probably got the network to drop some heavy stacks for the Roots... Or Black just got tired or touring...<br>  <br>  Q3: I havent seen 'em yet, but i've always been a fan of jimmy fallon.|`|9af0VDzcaa	Probably next year and no I don't think that the roots are wasting talent by taking such a confined position as a houseband and about Late Night with Jimmy never watch it|`|wfZhkZO0aa	Hopefully soon.<br>  <br>  I don't think so.  There is a lot of talent wrapped up in the group that is "The Roots".

The Roots are in my "Fresh Air" section of music and I am looking forward to something new!<br>  <br>  I dont know about wasting their talent but I like the fact that they do they own thing!

They should stop reading manga and watching anime online. Its both a good and bad idea. Good because it helps fandom. Bad because no one wants to buy and they think that the internet has everything.<br>  <br>  Its sad.|`|U0FgxEJxaa	I haven't read any of the previous answers, so I apologize if I repeat something.  <br>  <br>  I think the current economic state has taken a toll on Anime, although to what extent I don't know.

And, I have also been checking Manga out like a crazy woman at a nearby branch of the County Library!!  I am very happy that reserving books (how I have gotten most of them) doesn't cost money as it does in the City Library system!  Otherwise, I would be strictly an online viewer / reader.

TpG33NoWaa	We like to think, as we age, that we have grown more discerning with the passing of time.   I very much doubt, however, that this completely accounts for the sometimes drastic changes in our love for particular works.<br>  <br>  When I remember my devout passion for heroic music, I sometimes squirm with embarrassment.    [Much of this embarrassment is simply because I am something of a musical snob, perhaps.]   <br>  <br>  Youthful passions have a habit of wearing out, and as an older people, we wonder what we ever saw in certain works.    Now I am old, I am quite sure that the percentage of music that I love is considerably smaller than once it was.  <br>  <br>  We are told that some characteristics of older people are grumpiness, intolerance, and opinionated ranting.  I realise that I try hard to prove to the world that these characteristics do not live in me, and that I am open to new ideas and concepts continuously, accepting of other people's differing standpoints, and as agnostic about certain issues as ever I was.  <br>   I'm afraid that this is mostly a pose, a veneer.<br>  <br>  Perhaps because I am an organist, I doubt that my devotion to the polyphony of Bach will ever disappear.  The profundity of this man tends to overwhelm me. <br>   To my astonishment, however, my veneration of some of his great organ works has begun to shrink, and I listen to recordings played on neo-baroque organs with a growing distaste for them. <br>   I now see in this type of performance a fake attempt to show fidelity, a fusty rejection of the present, and pretentious cuteness.<br>  <br>  This is such a change from my Bastille-storming days of advocacy of a return to the Baroque ideals of organ design, that I wonder what has happened to me!  <br>   [ People such as myself asked our communities to spend millions of their dollars on this antiquarian fad, and I begin to reject the result we 'achieved'  -   now I am old.   How very embarrassing!]<br>  <br>  As a composer in my younger days, I shared a pseudo-Bohemian passion for electronic music, and spent years in this now-extinct activity.  [I am grateful that much of my output from this time of 'hedonistic delusion' is lost.]      <br>  <br>   'Fads pass, and I am as susceptable to fashion as anyone'.   That is the most likely explanation!<br>  <br>  My present adoration of Britten and Stravinsky has not always been thus.  My passion for Webern and Bartok has diminished over time.  So what !<br>  <br>   How very fortunate we are that the Art we love is so extensive and so varied, able to supply us with joy and inspiration whatever our age.   Even if our concepts of musical beauty change again and again, there is so much available to enjoy.|`|9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	For me, I'm afraid it's Shostakovich. When I was young, then a student, and then into young adult life, I worshipped Shostakovich. I even wrote a thesis on him at university.<br>  <br>  Although there are still many of his works I enjoy and admire, I am much fussier now and I find it hard to stomach some of the works I consider among his weaker ones, such as:<br>  <br>  Cello Sonata<br>  The Limpid Stream<br>  Piano Concerto No 2<br>  Piano Sonata No 2<br>  Song of the Forests<br>  String Quartets 4 & 6<br>  Symphonies 3 and 12<br>  <br>  There are, however, some works by Shostakovich which rate as among the best of the 20th century:<br>  <br>  Both Cello Concertos<br>  The Execution of Stepan Razin<br>  Lady Macbeth from Mtsensk<br>  Both Violin Concertos<br>  String Quartets 5, 8, 9, 10 & 13<br>  Symphonies 4, 8, 10 and 14<br>  <br>  What has happened over the years is that I have become a lot more discerning.|`|NJaZBgDwaa	Well in the last five years I have gone from liking only what was popular on the radio, to the most random classical music.  <br>  <br>  There was a time in my life where I said that I "liked" hip-hop. Now I hate it, I hardly consider it music, sometimes the lyrics are poetry and have a message but I think the message is lost in the delivery.<br>  Three years ago, I started listening to classical music, and then I only listen to opera, namely operas by mozart, Rossini, and Verdi. Then I heard Carmen, and loved it.But since then I have expanded my love of classical music beyond opera. <br>  <br>  I dont think that my taste in classical music has changed much. I will admit that I do like Baroque music more now than I did this time last year, (when I was having a massive obsession with German Romanticism... Schubert in particular!)<br>  <br>  I will also admit that I am not nearly as old as you! (I am sixty years younger than you, man that makes me feel so young and inexperienced!)|`|xcPzZvsraa	The only one would the music of the Strauss family,Blue Danube and the like.<br>  When I first discovered classical music I loved that stuff.<br>  Now,well I'd rather garrote myself with cheese wire.<br>  Why,well I don't know.<br>  Not to be disparaging to this music of course.<br>  <br>  <edit for Del_icio><br>  Arggh! You mentioned the fourth string quartet.<br>  Oh I really love that piece if only for the last few bars which I think are so amazing that it more than compensates for all that preceded.<br>  Or am I confusing it with another?<br>  I will have to go and check.<br>  <br>  <correction><br>  Dohh! as my avatar would say.<br>  I had indeed confused the one with the other.<br>  The other being the rapturous ending of the 2nd.|`|1204e9a4f0121ebac48e7d8f61d56242aa	Yes Alberich, like you my listening habits have changed over time.  I find that I have tended to listen to a lot of one composer at a time and then move on to another until I am saturated with their style.  My tastes have always leaned toward the forms of the symphony, symphonic poem and opera overtures.  I too progressed through Mozart, Bach, Beethoven, and then on to Brahms, Bruckner (with full scores in hand), Wagner, the Russians (Shostakovich and Prokofiev primarily), Elgar, and Ralph Vaughn Williams and others.  Only lately have I come around to exploring in more detail the work of Chopin and Rachmaninov. <br>  <br>  Along the way I have picked out favorite sections or movements that I return to listen to whenever the mood strikes- the first movements of Brahms 4th, Beethoven's 5th, Shostakovich's 5th, the Overture to Die Meistersinger (Wagner), Les Prelude (Liszt), Saint-Saens Symphony #3, and the Wind Serenades of Mozart. I also find that I enjoy repeated hearings of Howard Hanson's "Songs of Democracy", Lenny Bernstein's "Candide" (the overture and the "Make Our Garden Grow"), and Delius' "Song of Summer."<br>  <br>  I still search for new works to listen to, but I enjoy having my old favorites to fall back on when needed.<br>  <br>  Musician, composer, teacher.|`|AA10125474	When I was in my teens, I adored Khatchaturian, especially the Piano concerto and the Gayen Ballet suite.  Now I think it's crap. <br>  <br>  Turn the questions on it's ear, and I would say I used to loath Mozart -- but I grew up and the two have switched places.  So I am like you in that way.<br>  <br>  Do you think perhaps that one must gain a great deal of musical experience before one "gets" Mozart?  I have noticed that many youthful listeners do not like his music.  It takes time to absorb the subtlety of Mozart, I think.<br>  <br>  I think the same could be said of Chopin.  (and really, isn't it pianists who mostly appreciate him?)<br>  <br>  Richard Strauss is also a composer I was passionate about in my youth, but now find long-winded and overblown.<br>  <br>  Unlike you, I have never tired of LVB's music -- and the more I read through his sonatas the more I admire him.  <br>  <br>  Cheers, <br>  <br>  Glinzek|`|PS0oSoXFaa	Oh dear, you're scaring me! I'm one of the few people my age who actually loves classical music (I'm 22), and I hope I never get tired of any of it. I'm still a neophyte, I generally prefer the Romantics, but I've been moving through Bach and love that too, in a different way, and one of these days I'll get to 20th century music. Wagner, though, may take me a while to like... :) I don't doubt his genius, but it's not exactly your everyday stuff!<br>  <br>  This may be a silly question, but have you ever tried other genres of music? Newer stuff? And do you like any rock? I'm not trying to sound like a know-it-all, believe me (you'd know better than I would!), but a lot of music in other genres is great too. Maybe it's not quite as good as classical, but I still love it. You've probably heard the best classic rock songs (like Stairway to Heaven), don't know if you like those... I'm thinking specifically, though, of some alternative rock bands (the stuff that isn't usually on the radio) and, believe it or not, a few gothic metal bands. A lot of them are predictably awful (cheesy lyrics and pop voices, or bombastic music and "growlers", horrors like that), but a few are amazing- they have classically-trained songwriters who aren't afraid to experiment, fronted by opera singers. It sounds like a strange combination, I never thought I'd like metal anything!, but bands like Nightwish (until the last album with their new singer) have some great songs. Even my dad likes them, and that's saying something. He has a classical music collection to die for, over 400 records and 200 CD's, and I don't think he's listened to anything else in years. (Yeah, not everything new is hip-hop and Brittany Spears, thank God!)<br>  <br>  Well, it's worth a shot, it may be something new... Otherwise I can't help you, you obviously know much more about classical music than I do. <br>  <br>  I hope you find something. Interesting question!|`|ec55348158c3fd8764f5daba79c0af3daa	I am a few years younger than you and grew up listening to what we then called "popular" music--pre Rock and Roll.  I listened to cowboy songs (the Sons of the Pioneers) "Your Hit Parade" and didn't give much thought to classical music, although--as a Lutheran--I was exposed to the church music of Bach.<br>  <br>  While in high school I got my first radio job, as a disk jockey (I hate that term) playing different kinds of music, some of which was classical.  I began to develop a love and taste for the music, which grew during my college years.<br>  <br>  Since I have been in and out of radio in the years since then I have continued to be exposed to all kinds of music.<br>  <br>  I find that I have a highly varied range of musical tastes.  Gone are the cowboy songs--but I do like some country music (especially Johnny Horton and Johnny Cash) and have a growing affinity for good Bluegrass.<br>  <br>  I like some Rock and Roll, mainly that of the late 1960's and early to mid '70's.  I like a lot of classical music, including Beethoven, Bach, Mozart, Vivaldi, Chopin, et al, but the list continues to grow as I expose myself to Ravel, Mahler, Wagner and others.  There is so much good music that I cannot become bored of it.<br>  <br>  Frankly there are some modern classical pieces that don't do much for me.  If I happen to hear them on a classical music radio station that's when I usually pop in a CD.<br>  <br>  I consider myself fortunate to have seen a lot of changes in the ways we are exposed to music and are able to hear the music we choose.  When I was a small child music came on 78 rpm records and was all monaural.  I saw the introduction of "binaural" or stereo, 45 rpm records, 33 rpm long play records, reel to reel home audiotape, cassettes, 8-tracks, CD's and the MP3 players so popular today.  I have seen the rise and fall of 4-track audio, and have been a little amazed at the popularity of music videos.<br>  <br>  I have been fortunate on a few occasions to have seen and heard live symphonic performances.<br>  <br>  To me variety is everything.  No, I am not a little child with a short attention span.  And I am rarely bored.  It always amazes me when people dismiss any music as having no merit.  Even the music I dislike has some merit to some person or persons.<br>  <br>  I could write a very long list of music I would just as soon avoid having to listen to, but in most cases I have listened to it and know full well why I would prefer to avoid it.  <br>  <br>  Your question suggests that you are open to music less familiar to you, as am I.  We never dislike music we have liked--it just moves back a little to make room for music we (perhaps temporarily) like more.<br>  <br>  It's not like a teenager who was infatuated with Britney a few years ago and now can't stand to listen to her.  We don't lose our past musical loves when we meet new ones.  But like the teenager we know what we like for right now and that is where we focus.<br>  <br>  Good question.  Thank you for your insightful answer to mine a few days ago.  I'm glad the voters chose it as best answer.  It would have been my choice as well.|`|kPAj0p0Naa	Taste definitely changes - or should I say "evolves"? And it's only natural, since we constantly change who we are. Maybe we should call this process "taste growing" - like we say we "grow" under the influence of everything that happens to us...<br>  <br>  My taste has been expanding. I still love everything I used to love to listen/play, and a lot of others joined in. For instance, as a teenager I couldn't stand Bach and Chopin. Now I frequently play their works - and I love it. Also, "my favourite piano/violin/cello/etc. concertos", "my favourite symphonies" and so on, are exactly the same as 15 years ago. But maybe that's just me... anyway, I'd be terribly surprised to wake up one morning and realize I prefer Wagner to Puccini ;)<br>  <br>  Very good question... best luck|`|rNqF4gIVaa	I have to say... and this may be because I am nothing more than an enthusiastic amateur, that I have not really developed a truly jaded attitude to any of the works of the great composers. I still love Beethoven's Symphonies (I am listening to No.1 right now), but I actively try to avoid listening to any particular work too frequently... this is why I can still listen to the Moonlight Sonata and still be appreciative and moved by its depth and beauty. In an effort to widen my listening, I periodically acquire works that I have previously ignored or irrationally avoided. In recent months I have been exploring twentieth century British composers, a activity that stems from my love and admiration for Vaughan Williams whose music I find positively transcendent.<br>  Even more recently, I have been listening to Howard Hanson's first two symphonies, a little more Shostakovich and a tentative investigation of Stravinsky, who until recently I had decided was not deserving of all the "fuss."<br>  However I musically wander, I still periodically return to those core works and find things about them that I hadn't appreciated before.|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	As one gets older the music that fits one's animas shifts. I should never had considered Schumann in my youth but now I never tire of his cello music. Mahler , I adored in my youth but now deem him an adolescent never really reaching maturity. I shall never tire of Wagner; Ii am constantly finding new marvels in his truly great works. I agree on the Beetroot , excepting the marvellous late quartets and wonderful piano sonatas. Sibelius always has, and I'm very much afraid always will do absolutely nothing for me. Mozart, only the vocal music retains any hold...BUT BACH will always inhabit a special place in both mine and any musician's heart.<br>  <br>  The Russian Opera greats is something I have turned in the last 10 years, attending a Kirov performance of Boris(1869) under Gergiev shall remain one of the most sublime experience in my life of listening to music.|`|70jNDiIiaa	Hi Alberich,<br>  <br>  As usual, you have posed a very interesting question, and one that I've carefully contemplated before attempting my answer.<br>  <br>  I think that generally, my musical tastes haven't changed that much over the decades. I fell in love with Mozart, Handel, Vivaldi, Monteverdi and JS Bach  when I was a kid - now I'm in my 40's, and - well, I'm still passionate about Mozart, Handel, Vivaldi, Monteverdi and JS Bach. <br>  <br>  Over the years, I've collected a few "secondary" favourites like Gabrieli, Albinoni, Telemann, Byrd, Lully and Marais. As for later music, well I've flirted a little with Beethoven over the years (especially his piano concertos) but he never quite made it into my "harem." I even had a short, firey fling with Stravinsky when I was an orchestral bassoonist - intoxicating, yes, but not enough to keep me addicted. <br>  <br>  My tendency is to have "love affairs" with my five favourite men - I "rediscover" them one at a time and I simply gorge myself on him for months on end, often a year. These "affairs" are intense, but then they gradually fade and I'll move on and recycle another old flame for the umpteenth time. (But during these obsessive stages, I still enjoy other music, too, desides my current "heart throb" - don't worry, I'm not THAT obsessive!)<br>  <br>  I've recently emerged from an unusually obsessive year long liaison with Vivaldi, and I'm currently experiencing the heady joy of rediscovering my passion for Handel. I can't get enough of him at the moment! It's fun going through my CD collection and taking all my Handel recordings and putting them onto my MP3 player, so I can indulge myself whenever the time's right. <br>  <br>  But it's always the same five favourite composers, and I love them all equally - but only one at a time.<br>  <br>  Who knows will come next? All I know is that it'll either be Mozart, Monteverdi or JS Bach...<br>  <br>  I don't know why I'm like this. I think that each composer satisfies a certain need in my soul, a facet of my being...that's the closest I can come to explaining it.<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  Hafwen.

This could not only result in you losing your job (almost inevitable) but might even involve criminal proceedings.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I would even delete this question.<br>  <br>  Good luck (and don't do it again).<br>  Steve.|`|YQLTdXhjaa	idk what HR means, human resource?<br>  <br>  if you're saying you were snooping in his things, that's not okay....you don't trust him, if there's no trust, there's no relationship|`|eqKlHSaLaa	You checked the what o.O?..........If i knew what it was i could probably tell you.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	no..don't tell him anything.|`|RQfLKOPQaa	If you think he will find out, tell him, if not then keep it to yourself. on a personal note, if you don't trust him enough, maybe you should find another bf, if you trust him but are just the suspicious type, then maybe you should reevaluate what you're about. I don't think it's healthy having a relationship without trust.|`|f582421fab21195960a57126a91727beaa	No, absolutely not. That's not something some people will respond well to AT ALL. In fact it's would be a deal breaker. <br>  <br>  A girlfriend of mine once wend behind my back to check my bank account balance and grades before agreeing to be exclusive. I dumped her on the spot, and have never regretted it. <br>  <br>  Maybe you were just curious(which is the excuse my Ex gave me), which is understandable to me now, but some people jump to conclusions and make assumptions. So i'd keep it to yourself unless you two have been going out a long time, but i don't get that impression.|`|o0JOTzj0aa	honey, you really should add a little extra detail to ur questions...it's hard to know how to answer.  <br>  <br>  If you found out something massive and bad about him, then tell him, and talk about the issue.  If not, why would you even need to tell him?|`|DfBH8Dr9aa	No just keep it positive.He does not need to know really.|`|QVZDhgAqaa	Same happend To my Girl friend ...

If it was a REAL relationship then there wouldn't be a "too much" of each other. If someone uses that excuse to get some space then to me they are ignorant fools who do not need a partner if they are going to treat them like that.|`|Hzf3QK9faa	One person when I was  young, they didn't know me very well and were being judgmental because they were hurting.|`|YMnTveWuaa	Only when I had velrco mittens on, and there was velcro on the buttplug and dildoes we were using.|`|ojEkgJoqaa	No just the opposite<br>  <br>  They are the one's who are too clingy|`|DfBH8Dr9aa	No but I plan on doing that and them liking it. I need plenty of sensory input.|`|a1pmr73vaa	Restaining order wise YES!|`|XTWClFLQaa	Nope, the opposite.|`|786cdd812ce5aab02a737d9a44746cdbaa	Not that I can readily recall.|`|Mu3UvybKaa	I've been with the same one for so long, I don't recall.<br>  Although he has implied before that he is on too short of a leash.|`|kc1IBYMRaa	I seem to be accused of the opposite more often.|`|BLEYaodFaa	I'm sure in my younger, dating years someone along the line did, but now I'm old and married and I can't remember. LOL|`|eBawQWAbaa	nope quite the contrary,<br>  <br>  i break up with people after 4 weeks cause i think they're to clingy|`|i15KoiJhaa	No one has ever accused me of being to clingy...<br>  <br>  Talking to much, yes.|`|CffRZnv5aa	yes when im constantly getting followed|`|yZnnsxElaa	Nope how about you well maybe lol|`|a6d56e0e2034b084029811b6a6064fdeaa	well my ex bf was..and he said i was the one too clingy..|`|z2DmmhqJaa	Yeah.

WtTUNC8Naa	1. The Bloop:<br>  Throughout the summer of 1997, an ultra low-frequency, unusually lengthy hum was picked up from the ocean.The scientific verdict was that the recording matches that of an animal but one much, much larger than a blue whale, the largest animal known to man. To this day no credible answer has been given as to what, or who, caused The Bloop.<br>  <br>  2. Ghosts:<br>  Believe in them or not, the fact remains that lots of people, with various degrees of conviction, are certain they have seen ghosts and yet science has neglected to examine any connection between this world and the next.While science would argue that it's an irrelevance thousands of amateur societies, paranormal researchers and Yvette Fielding think the truth is still out there.<br>  <br>  3.Yawning:<br>  The yawn is undoubtedly one of the most bizarre and potentially useless human traits that have baffled scientists for centuries.Popular diagnoses include the idea that yawning 'cools off' the brain, that it's a simple psychological reaction to boredom, or even that it's a means of preventing alveolar collapse. In other words - they don't conclusively know why we yawn.<br>  <br>  4.StoneHenge:<br>  Each year, millions of tourists arrive to stand at a distance and wonder what Stonehenge is all about.The stone circle is now widely regarded by experts and historians as a burial site, but it still leaves the visitor to ponder how such an early society managed to carve such a monument so spectacularly and accurately with no industrial tools to speak of.<br>  <br>  5.Dark Matter:<br>  Only 5% of the known universe is acknowledged 'stuff', the bits in between this 5% is what really causes scientists to have sleepless nights as they ponder what this so-called dark matter is.The latest argument is that dark matter is made of 'WIMP' (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles) - but the problems studying WIMPs are numerous: They're immeasurably fast, tiny and basically invisible, so don't expect an answer soon.|`|usIma0vIaa	The Causes Of Homosexualiy<br>  reasons for night mares.|`|WyhUICfjaa	Reality Television|`|86qCUUjvaa	Why zombies exist.|`|ge5x9NHxaa	The existence of God and how man was created.|`|U2NMdf4Qaa	ghosts|`|VNum3TKyaa	Men|`|abx5VNsOaa	Neurotransmitters in Paris Hiltons head.|`|DfBH8Dr9aa	Not really.

xTioPxaVaa	A bar or measure has nothing to do with a guitar per se.  It has to do with music notation.<br>  <br>  I'm going to murder the technical terms, but this will serve for an explanation.<br>  <br>  A measure (or bar, they're used interchangeably), is a way to divide music in sections that are easy to count.  In a band or orchestra situation, is also allows for the conductor to reference starting parts within the music, as in "let's start at measure 234".<br>  <br>  Another useful aspect of measures is to provide an easy way to notate for a section in band to come in after a long break.  For example, if the trumpets aren't supposed to come in for 48 measures into a song, it would get a little tedious to have 48 individual measures with nothing but rests in them (not to mention taking up more space on the page).  There's a special notation that can be put on the music along with the number of measures to sit out that's a lot easier to read.  You still have to count them, but it's not a visually challenging!<br>  <br>  How many beats are in a measure depend on the time signature that the song is in.  The time signature looks like a fraction at the beginning of the music.  The most common time signature is 4/4.  The top number means that there are 4 beats in each measure.  The bottom note means that a quarter note gets one count.<br>  <br>  A waltz would normally be in 3/4.  So, in this instance, it's 3 beats to a measure, and the quarter note still gets one count.<br>  <br>  You'll also see 6/8 sometimes.  This is like 3/4 but with a slower feel.  There would be 6 counts to a measure and the eighth note would get one count.<br>  <br>  Rush plays a lot of songs in 5/4 and 7/4.  There are certain Dream Theater songs that have some really bizarre time signatures, like 17/16 (which is really pretty tough to count).<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you out.<br>  <br>  Greetings from Austin, Tx<br>  <br>  Ken

a1Ngi39Xaa	Thanks for the picture links!!  I love it when Danny comes back on the show for guest appearances.  He was always one of my favorites.  Christine got a little too holier-than-thou for me there at the end before she left.<br>  <br>  I do miss Nina a lot!  She was great on the show.  It would be good for her to be there now with all that is going on with Jill, Esther, and Kay.|`|qAoM2Jp5aa	Yes, I would love to see them come back! I love it when they do the flashbacks too...the pictures are cute.|`|LO3BMobRaa	I do, I miss all the classic couples like: Victor & Nikki, Nick & Sharon, Olivia & Nate Sr., Neil & Dru, Bobby &Brittney, J.T. & Colleen, etc. They don't have couples like they used to. I miss the days when they used to marry for "LOVE", not money, sex, blackmail, fashion statements, or to prove a point. That's what I can't stand about younger viewers that don't know the FULL Y&R history. These couples married for love and went down the middle of the road together. They were so solid that not even infidelity and/or jealous mistresses didn't or couldn't come between them. Plus whenev er they did break up, they always found there way back to each other. That's why I hate that Nick & Sharon are not together, because now they don't have any more "Original" CBS couples.|`|rqwXqmyTaa	Looking at those pictures takes me back!  LOL....I can remember when they called Christine, Cricket!  She hasn't been on in a really long time.

3voM7Gfsaa	Not death metal, not metalcore; not much hardcore in their sound at all. The term metalcore gets applied to so many bands (as does hardcore) that really have no link to it. Just seems 'core' is used as a suffix for any band of an alternative nature at the moment, in the same way that 'screamo' is used by some people to represent any band that has screaming.<br>  <br>  I'd say they were just a metal band. There's a definite death metal influence in there, but you can also hear thrash, melodic metal and a whole heap of other influences. They're not extreme enough to be death metal in sound.|`|tQNF7i7Baa	no ur wrong and right. they r a metalcore band a very good one too but their really not that death to me anyway their vocals and guitar sound too clean and not distorted unlike death metal(awful music)|`|c52F2UnYaa	their aren't Death Metal, metalcore because they have some kind of metal in it mixing with hardcore, they msut have haveir guitars and gutural vocals to be Death Metal|`|F5Jms9OBaa	They are definitely a death metal band for sure like you said they do all the characteristics of a death metal band|`|kP0JGI1waa	they are far from it, here are really the characteristics of death metal:<br>  <br>  1. death growling almost exclusively, with some high vocals but mostly gutteral deep growls, and aild mostly has high vocals and singing (there is almost NEVER singing in death metal)<br>  2. lots of blast beats, which aild does not really incorporate much at all.<br>  3. no breakdowns, which aild has.  the only breakdowns in real death metal are like the one in inveracity's savagely beaten, that chugging slow riff.<br>  4. extremely downtuned guitars, dropped to C,B, or A.  aild is in drop D at the lowest, which is way too high.  aild is not really heavy at all.

FKdvF0VCaa	I also play guitar and I've noticed the same thing. <br>  Here's what I think:<br>  <br>  Nick isn't the best guitar player in the world. He plays rythm. That's the part that's easy and th part that you can always find tabs for. <br>  Kevin is a lot more talented than his younger brother. He plays very well. His solos are pretty difficult. Kevin usually plays lead in almost every song. You'll find that it's more difficult to play his parts than it is to play Nick's. <br>  <br>  So basically, Nick's only okay. Kevin is awsome. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3mPhg2QDKw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3mPhg2QD...</a><br>  <br>  ^ watch and be amazed by Kevin's mad guitar skills.|`|M9EcpbmDaa	yep they can play well!<br>  kevin better than the other two, he is actually really great but doesn't get the oppertunity to show it much!<br>  nick and joe can play aswell but, kevin is the best :}|`|Yazpoadnaa	Yes, all three boys can sing and play guitar very well!<br>  They are very talented.|`|t6k3yoNdaa	I noticed that too. I'm unsure though, Kevin seems to have all the guitar talent.|`|4mIraoy8aa	I believe Kevin can play it well, he does some of the more technical solos...<br>  I think Joe just does the basics.<br>  And Nick is pretty good, but again, nothing ridiculously special.<br>  <br>  When I started learnng guitar, I looked at Black Sabbath books and Blink-182 books. BIG difference. Tony Iommi was a guitar god, and Tom DeLonge was just not. Good, but didn't blow me away.<br>  <br>  They're not the next Santana or Hendrix.<br>  <br>  ************<br>  Edit:<br>  I do think Kevin and Nick kinda play their skills down.<br>  If they were asked to cover a song that had a more technical guitar part, I think they could do it. At least Kevin, Guitar is his true passion.|`|weCMngvLaa	No.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  No.|`|hbxObNPWaa	yes, all them can, realy well!|`|Ibj8FjfRaa	They could play the guitar.|`|eUFsTmlsaa	They play all of their own Instruments...and no that's not as far as their skill level goes maybe that's how they want it to be and it all has to do with the lyrics and the tempo of the song..if it doesn't fit they won't make it sound stupid!...and plus not only do they all play guitar but Nick plays the drums and the piano and joe plays the tambourine and the keyboard so they are all very talented...have you ever been to one or their concerts? they have like guitar and drum competitions between each of their band member and they got some skill...plus Kevin taught himself how to play guitar within a week..but no theres nothing special about them..hope this helps
sc4BtGxGaa	Apparently this same illness covers the inability to TRY to learn to read music, as well.  And as for YA violations - I cannot TELL you how many times I got one for "do your own homework" - when I was part of a SERIES of answers all saying the same thing.  If I went to YA anonymously, to check - the OTHER answers were there - but MINE was the one reported.

P8gGMlbIaa	I've grown very sick of Hollywood and the majority of pinhead in it. Sean Penn is one of them, after getting his award he condemns people that voted for Prop 8 and almost in the same breath praised Obama. Who has openly said is he's against gay marriage, but for civil unions. <br>  <br>  My disgust with Hollywood and it's hypocrisy goes further than that, they condemn the rich CEOs while it's ok for loud mouth celebrities to make millions.<br>  <br>  I've already boycotted Hollywood, I refuse to support Obama's socialist friends. Let them rot and download a bootleg movie if you have to, just don't give these millionaires that have forgotten that we made them that rich any more money. <br>  <br>  It's time for a movie goers revolt.|`|xqrwDmyUaa	What are you rambling about? Sean Penn's birth name is Sean Justin Penn. You make no sense. And Sean and Rourke are very good friends so I have no idea why you think attacking Penn is somehow making things better for Rourke.

9TeE1K3Eaa	I like the idea of Christian and Liz together, but Christian would not be Christian if he were not sleeping with every woman that he can get. The writer will probably have them divorce. <br>  <br>  I have also heard that next season will be the last.  I thought this season was really short.  Was there 13 episodes?|`|e304475cdacf34c924c6fa327c99de8eaa	YES!  Of course we all suspected (hoped) that we wouldn't lose Christian.  I guess we'll see if Kimber is here to stay, although I have to say that it's more than a little creepy that Christian was going to marry her, then she married his son, now she's back to him for the $$.  <br>  <br>  Maybe the show has run it's course?

bbHoF5jsaa	The Plott Hound was officially adopted as the State Dog on August 12, 1989.The Plott Hound breed originated in the mountains of North Carolina around 1750 and is the only breed known to have originated in this state. Named for Jonathan Plott who developed the breed as a wild boar hound, the Plott Hound is a legendary hunting dog known as a courageous fighter and tenacious tracker. He is a gentle and loyal companion to hunters of North Carolina. The Plott Hound is very quick of foot with superior treeing instincts and has always been a favorite of big-game hunters.The Plott Hound has a beautiful brindle-colored coat and a spine-tingling, bugle-like call.

sExo0KD2aa	Well Lost is just a very nice mind game!<br>  <br>  1. Although Ben is a very ambiguous character, I believe that everything he does is for the greater good. He certainly has some history with Widmore but I think Charles is the real bad guy.<br>  <br>  2. Why, yes!<br>  <br>  3. Really a big question and we are waiting this answer from this episode. He was very upset when he heard that Locke knew about the woman who could help them. Perhaps he assumed that since John know such information he must definitely return to the island dead as Richard had said.<br>  <br>  4. We don't know that. He must has taken the place of Jacob (Jack's father maybe? he was on the same flight, in a coffin and he needed something that belonged to father Shephard). We don't know whether he is human or not.

Ben killed Locke because he needed the information he had or he thought Locke knew too much (He was desperate to keep him alive until he mentioned Elouise)<br>  4.

Jack's dad really alive, Locke's dad screwed him out of a kidney - then somehow ended up on the island aswell, Claire's dad is jack's dad, Kate tried to kill her step father, Hurley's dad only came back once he heard about teh money, and Penny's father - charles widmore - used to be on the island. I think all their fathers were on the island before them or something along those lines)|`|H7Fuij30aa	Hooray!!<br>  <br>  1.  I am SO confused.   It would be such a twist if Charles ended up being a total good guy...<br>  2.  I hope so. :(<br>  3. I am thinking Ben is going to have a "good" reason to why he did it tonight or maybe he'll just be like "it was for the island."<br>  4. Probably something to do with the island.  There better be a ton of stuff revealed tonight.<br>  <br>  I loved seeing Danielle so young, did you?  And I was so happy when it turned out Jin was actually alive!

Because of this, they talk to me about they're problems, and are open with their feelings towards me. So they tell me how girls work without me having to ask, And if i do need to ask how girls work, they are happy to answer in return, so that now i understand my girlfriend about as well as i think it is possible for a man to understand a women.<br>  <br>  And also, remember they are human beings, before you do or say anything think how YOU would react, it will be a similar reaction for them.<br>  <br>  And it helps that my girlfriend is friends with these girls too, so they know eachiother :)<br>  <br>  That help?|`|xjd3GKbSaa	be a jackass and then be surprisingly nice. <br>  <br>  i only answered seriously because i f*cking hate all of you.|`|AA10378030	Just as women understand men!!    hahahhahahha righttttttttt..|`|lVIKtbMoaa	STICK YOUR TOUGUE OUT AND WRRIGLE IT.<br>  <br>  They'll get the message;)|`|LSXdwRDUaa	yes there is.

uUzbqGh5aa	Omg!! Now l hope she does find out that she's pregnant since it would be a better chance of the kid being Billy's!|`|AA11369432	He is mesmerized by an older women.|`|IsxB0Qi7aa	I haven't seen that episode yet, but: What is Billy thinking?!? I really had hoped he would at least try to have a relationship with Chloe (for Cordelia's sake), but now you say he's having sex with Sharon again! If she does turn out to be pregnant, I hope there is no doubt it is Billy's, I really don't want to watch another one of those: Who's the baby's Daddy situations again.|`|OBwqjS8maa	Maybe he sees it as a "last hurrah" before he gets married. Either way, I find it extremely gross. I usually like Sharon, but she's really been bugging me lately. She needs HELP. I'm kind of hoping they'll send her to the loony bin, so at least when she comes back she'll be "normal."|`|uVwPykXlaa	mm dont know,mybe she will fall pregnant  this time.and also spoilers are saying nick will not resist tempation from sharon.<br>  maybe thas another drama coming.<br>  WHOS THE DADDY?|`|6c30b5116a79d741042462d73fcdf99aaa	I just hope that Cloe and Jackdon't fine out....Jack may be a devious person, but he never did cheat on Sharon.|`|qWzN3i3Uaa	Thats what i was saying. You would think that they learned their lesson last time but they just don't learn. How does Billy figure he can marry Chloe while he is sleeping with another woman espically his brother's ex wife. And you'd think Sharon wouldn't do that again espically since BOTH of her ex husbands almost caught them last time. Last time they were drunk, this time they have NO excuse i mean come on. They were perfectly sober. I guess this will be one of those times when they wake up thinking "damn i shouldn't have done that........ again"|`|AA10821695	The direct answer to your question Aubrey is, they're in LUST, maybe you did miss something. As much as I like Sharon, she can be a "bit" irratic at times! <br>  <br>  Maybe she will get pregnant along with Lily and then we all can go through the guessing game of whether it's Nick's or Billy's :-)|`|ab2a840460fbbeb0af2b8c4445d4667baa	i am thinking of starting a ob/gyn clinic in genoa city.  with all the unplanned pregnacies, sharon acting like a ho in heat...i can make a killing.|`|kriY76deaa	I think the Billy and Sharon thing was predictable...as far as being pregnant it will probably turn out to be Nicks...|`|4kuWOZowaa	I know right! URGH|`|sVlFl2dbaa	Yea I know, this is crazy right? I was just wondering the same thing.
y8WBcehmaa	No, i loved them both. I thought she was incredible in both|`|02f6e89a635c7219ed21b4ba1e0467daaa	I've only seen Revo. Rd - but I was completely impressed by that movie.  It was a much better movie than "Slumdog".|`|AA10648484	I think she was great but i did not think too great to win all those awards. I think she is just lucky to be sofavorable in critics eyes where there is a big void in good women acting when Julia Roberts is on hold, Halle Berry and Nicole Kidman are hibernating and Naomi Watts is just not making up her mind fast enough.
7fEVNng5aa	Sometimes yes, sometimes no. When I hear Max Cavalera (Sepultura, Soulfly) sing I can tell he's not American, but I wouldn't be able to pick out that he's Brazilian.|`|bb2c6db52d268375a8f75ea7c3169389aa	From what I understand I guess it would be something like this. I know a few other languages and memorization is crucial. I suppose it might be how it is memorized.<br>  <br>  For instance, let's think about normal voice. Do we always talk in a singing tone? <br>  <br>  I would imagine the music is memorized with the accent attached for the performance. Just because you can roll an "r"(french) doesn't mean you have to roll "r's in English.<br>  <br>  Same thing like Korean. The L and R are a similar sound. Looks like a 2 on a calculator in Hangul.<br>  <br>  Just some examples. I have traveled some.|`|qThmcR1Aaa	I listen to The Flower Kings, a Swedish band that sings in English.<br>  <br>  Their singer definitely has an accent. I can think of one song where "horses" comes out something like "orrziz." And their grasp of English idioms is a little shaky at times, too.|`|tQNF7i7Baa	i like opeth and they sound pretty normal to me, listen to 3 libras its a song by some frenchies and is in a accent|`|IBm7rMHHaa	Most times yeah they do just sound normal its usually just a few words they have trouble with that you can hear there accent in  <br>  -let me know if this helps|`|IvAJwpjgaa	some do. but some hire English-speaking vocalists or front men.|`|iEjmCX98aa	yea they have a little accent, but it makes them sound better
oMj8WAHFaa	i never did when did i say that, oh lols, no i still think you love me, of course you do as much as i love you,am i right?|`|5ciDai7Paa	well this is kind of sudden..um..I'm sorry...I guess I never reliesed please forgive me!!!

I'm so heart broken!!|`|knQK17cyaa	cause your eyes are empty and your voice is monotoned and so not full of life.|`|eYzuxqQaaa	because im chuck norris|`|RyYV3aXlaa	don't lie you never liked me in the first place.........it was my money that you were in love with.........|`|SjLDdUh7aa	Because I'm sleeping with your best friend.|`|1d8f9804d5f64e940dfb5d7043f684edaa	because you lost your mind from doing all those drugs|`|lCeboITcaa	because im not your type|`|C6ee83Jbaa	you never loved me in the first place :P|`|DK6kYxmGaa	I don't even know you. lol|`|FXeuwkX0aa	While I am sleeping you take a cheese grater and rub it up and down really fast on the back of my legs.|`|8b976b2f9d559004564384a0e185cc1caa	Because we never met...
fk7ZA9b8aa	feed the emo to the vampire.|`|5j0NgLDmaa	Talk it out with them both. Find out what the subcultures that they're into are about. It's not as weird as you think. I know a girl who claims to be a cutter-Wiccan-Goth-Emo-bisexual-homophob... dresser. Turns out she was really none of those things; she was just saying those things to get attention. She only turned out to be a drunken ****.

Hard to say with any certainty who they are or whom they're working for.  But I hope they're listening because this is some of the best FREE market research they can ever hope to get.  If we're being used as sheep, I'm good with that so long as the labels stop signing bands that sound like Nickelback and radio learns that you don't have to play the same songs every five minutes in order to make money.|`|tuvcxnJXaa	All in all, we're just bricks in the wall...

hQ95u9OLaa	Yes he's a hack.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	I don't think there was anything wrong with the direction in the Charlie's Angels movies.  I think it was a silly plot (blame the writer) and crappy acting (blame the casting director).  At least it wasn't like the obnoxious Bourne movies or the awful Transformers direction where I can barely tell who's fighting whom at any given point and the camera is all shaky to instill excitement - or in my case, nausea.|`|kyEPS7xCaa	First Charlies Angels was okay, second was horrible.  Agreed with second poster.<br>  <br>  Also agree with Transformers comment (Michael Bay) being horrible.<br>  <br>  Remember, these 2 guys came from directing music videos, so that explains why their style is so chaotic.<br>  <br>  Bourne, however, was really good and matched the theme and mood of the movies.  <br>  <br>  For T4, well, after Jim Cameron stopped directing, I am not as interested, anyway.  He may have made that horrible Titanic movie, but his other stuff has been great.  Aliens, True Lies, Terminator 1 and 2, great stuff.|`|d7ad08b207b33f53609b7f36506e5efdaa	Fromt he previes so far, it looks pretty good.<br>  <br>  I thought the first Charlies Angels movie was quite entertaining. Full Throttle on the other hand was hopeless - more of a music video on steroids than a movie.<br>  <br>  I agree with the previous poster- ANYONE is better than Michael Bay and his rapid-panning blurry quick shots that make it impossible to clearly see the action.  He ruined Transformers with that crap.

T85WCEltaa	Being a huge Charlton Heston fan, I knew the classic line 'Soylent Green is people!' before I saw the film, but still found the film had great impact!  It's one of the few films I enjoyed that think should be remade now, with a modern day setting, because there are lessons in there about consumerism greed, dwindling resources, etc., that we may or may not face in the future.

ARlb3XBaaa	No your not reading people wrong.  Alot of people come into your life to serve a purpose or teach a lesson.  Once that has been attained they exit your life.

Then move on and take pride in the friends you have now and the ones you'll meet in the future.

Your assessment is dead-on.  It's fairly gay and dainty.  Think it was because I liked Simple Kind of Life for perhaps five minutes or so.  Once I heard Bathwater, I knew I was in serious trouble.  Those fifteen dollars aren't coming back anytime soon.  One thing for sure with this album was it marked the point where No Doubt stopped being about No Doubt and starting becoming more about the plastic faced Gwen Stefani.  Don't think that solo career is working out too well.  But Gavin is thrilled.<br>  <br>  Persephone! - Agreed.  My heart goes out to the other three dudes who deserved a far better fate than to be emasculated.  Good thing I stopped listening to Saturn.  Was very close to painting my bedroom pink.|`|M1OceGNLaa	It was their best album ever. I love all the songs from it, especially "Artificial Sweetener".

9BkmRT05aa	that's a tuff one im a capricorn female and my son father is a Sagittarius and i can not get a long with him for anything i really do not know why. sagittarius  are too controlling and always wanting to be in control|`|9MRSjkkxaa	Capricorn + Sagittarius <br>  <br>  Earth + Fire = Lava<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Sagittarius has an outgoing temperament, so with this sign of the zodiac you can expect to party—and party hard! They are really quite different from you, but you’ll still find them alluring. <br>  <br>  You’re often regarded as aloof; this is the result of inward-looking Saturn dominating your character. Sagittarius will change that. Many, but not all, Capricorns have a conservative approach to life, and aren’t as optimistic as Sagittarius.<br>  <br>  At first you might be overpowered by their personality, but you’ll soon get into the swing of their easy-going style. Sagittarius will shake you up until you show the other side of your character. This will actually make you feel pretty comfortable and upbeat. <br>  <br>  Sagittarius has a huge need for freedom. They often love sport and anything to do with the outdoors. As you are more reserved and cautious, you’ll need to accept their free-spirited ways into account and realise that this is an essential part of their life. <br>  <br>  You’ll need to educate Sagittarius about money. Sagittarius is interested in spending money … very freely! This could easily annoy you, because you want someone who is as prudent as you.<br>  <br>  The element of fire has a warming, tonic effect on your nature and if you may just want to join in their life escapades with them. By the same token, let’s hope that Sagittarius does not dismiss you as a long-term partner simply because you aren’t quite as effervescent as they are. <br>  <br>  Your sexual relationship isn’t quite as hot and passionate as Sagittarius would like. Both of you will need time to explore what satisfies you. Make sure you let Sagittarius know when they’re making an impact, though. If you don’t, they’ll worry. And if you put aside your ideas and habits for a while, you’ll find it’s worth it. <br>  <br>  There’s a glimmer of hope with Sagittarians born between 23 November and 1 December. They are less fiery, and thus more compatible with you. But make sure you spend time with them and get to know what makes them tick before you commit to them.<br>  <br>  If you join up with a Sagittarius born between 2 December and 11 December, be prepared for a clash of personalities: Mars and the star sign of Aries have a strong influence on them. They need to be right, all the time, and at all costs. <br>  <br>  Teaming up with Sagittarians born between 12 December and 21 December may not be a great idea. It’s certainly better to take it slowly with them. Your compatibility doesn’t seem high, and there could be plenty of stresses and strains between you.|`|DjJwKc9Caa	i'm a capricorn male and i love sagittarius women. they are the hottest sign out there. i gotta say, i agree with the first answerer. cappies are usually boring and prudent, but throw a sag in their way and they'll be as fun and adventurous as them. they say sags and caps are not supposed to get along but i get along with them just fine. i'm not your typical capricorn, i'm stupid, outgoing and hilarious. maybe that's why i'm always attracting sagittarius women|`|FtRogqRbaa	I think you can consider the sun sings (Cap & Sag) first, but mainly you need to keep in mind the MOON signs as well. Consider the sun as the soul - but the moon is the emotions . . . and sometimes that can make a relationship that doesn't sound 'do-able'.<br>  <br>  But on first glance . . . <eek> overly caution Capricorn with a freedom loving, adventurous Sagittarius?<br>  <br>  I dont know . . . lol

Probably not for a very an elongated period of time, the most useful muscles would be the back and legs, not arms.|`|6CQmGs8Daa	Didnt you just ask this question like 3 days ago?|`|KsklH4mQaa	Yup, I body slam my brother all the time ( he weighs like 135 i think) <br>  :D|`|xjd3GKbSaa	try growing some balls before asking a question next time|`|IYacMZCGaa	yes i can :-)|`|1UQ2pzYvaa	for how long?<br>  ... yeah i probably could.|`|GrwWH5XJaa	My girl is 105 and i'm 180.

bBsbuMPZaa	you really just have to relax, when you start to panic or think to much about it you start to sink. just relax and "spread peanut butter" with your arms and ride the bicycle with your legs! OR try the frog swim those are easy ones, if you do the frog swim, if you start to sink lift your butt up dont let it sink...cause you will then follow|`|PpWosZsIaa	I sink like a boulder|`|8b976b2f9d559004564384a0e185cc1caa	To float and swim with the flow, are you really that huge? lol jk.|`|G1lSbvAQaa	Flap your legs and hands and you should stay up... That's all there is to it.<br>  <br>  Just imagine this.  Pretend kinda, that you're trying to stay afloat in water and your pushing down on the water and up off of it so that you stay up.... Sorry I'm really bad at giving out written instructions of physical activites lol|`|9881c718c5d185396cfb435361c21078aa	You must learn to swim at an early age, the Billy Pilgram way.|`|toLCaFc9aa	Relax|`|2ab0f4f84a201bc39a3fb4a1b64db222aa	i just swim, try to distribute your weight correctly|`|7e96535a87be5e466413f7c6ab0e8a7baa	As long as you take a breath, you should be okay, the air in your lungs makes you float somewhat. Try it out in a shallow part of a pool or something sometime, get a lungful of air, go under the water, don't exhale for a while, just stay stationary and you should start to float upwards. <br>  I'm really not sure what the "secret" to swimming is, I just know if I kick while my legs are under me, and keep breathing I'll float.|`|pK1ImhaMaa	Because your body is not "weightless" gravity WILL submerge you a bit at FIRST, but if you just continue to RELAX and ALLOW your body to sink a bit, then within SECONDS, (IF you stay calm), you will "pop back up" to the surface! THE KEY IS TO STAY CALM EVEN IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE SINKING. Calmly paddle your arms and legs, and you will see that in no time...you will be SWIMMING!|`|d503428496b7275f70c66859957bdd07aa	Actually body fat has something to do with how easy you can swim. A skinny person has a harder time learning to swim than someone with a little body fat. <br>  I know this sounds stupid but I actually learned to swim under water (snorkel) before I learned how to keep myself above water. Once you can build enough muscle to swim fast enough you'll come up and eventually will stay up.|`|VXW1XeFsaa	I can swim but I don't like to so I don't think you're missing out on anything fun.  The thing that helped me was remembering to stay stretched out in one horizontal plane and keep my face in the water.  Then just turn your head to breathe as you use the appropriate leg and arm motions.|`|AA11809403	you have to have your body relatively flat.<br>  <br>  wish i could explain better than that.|`|XTWClFLQaa	Maybe you're fat|`|A1zfy4jEaa	laying on a surfboard does it for me. lol|`|9fyi9n76aa	Our human body is slightly denser than fresh water. In order to keep afloat we have to manouver our limbs to create an upward thrust. swiftly push the water down with your limbs keep and bring up with minimum drag. as long as you keep doing it you will be afloat. sea water is slightly denser so you can lie afloat if you balance your body and control breath to keep the face up|`|e3b8b825895e40fb941cd8e7d2ea18a0aa	I don't know because I can't swim either.

6qDhXpWfaa	Nana<br>  <br>  This would be a great romance for you. It's about two girls that are in their 20's. They meet on a train to Tokyo and find out that they're both named nana, are 20, and are moving to Tokyo. One's moving to Tokyo to be with her boyfriend and the other is moving to Tokyo to make it big as a vocalist (she's goth/punk). It sounds kind of lame, but believe me when I say there is loads of romance! =D<br>  <br>  Nodame Cantabile<br>  <br>  It's set in college. It's about a quirky, weird, girl that falls for the most popular guy at her music college. He's cold, handsome, and incredibly talented and can spot her hidden talent too. It's really funny, cute, and sweet at times. <br>  <br>  Honey and Clover<br>  <br>  It's set in college too. It's about a guy, takemoto, who falls at first sight for his professor's niece who's very cute and also looks way younger than she really is. Takemoto, Hagu-chan (the girl), and their friends all attend an art school and it follow them through their love trials and also trials and whatnot. It's really funny, cute, and touching.

956d43fbc612852be9834658deb4139faa	The final episode depicts Sam waking from his coma, only to find the modern world devoid of feeling compared to his life in 1973. He ultimately takes a joyful leap from the top of the police station, returning to the past. Writer Matthew Graham wrote the scene to indicate that Sam is now in the afterlife, but acknowledged that the ending is ambiguous and open to other interpretations, such as lead actor John Simm's belief that Sam may not have returned to the present.  The first episode of sequel series Ashes to Ashes shows Sam's personnel file, which is stamped "SUICIDE".<br>  <br>  In the final shot, the team drives off, with Sam and Gene bickering as usual. Children run past, including the girl from Test Card F. She looks directly into the camera before reaching out and "switching off" the television the viewer is watching, signifying that the story has come to an end.|`|AA10954273	Sam Tyler woke back up in the present.

Bowie stated he was a try-sexual. He would try anything once. Bowie later opted for the "straight" life and now denies a lot of what he did in the past.|`|HEQc83d9aa	Woah what a fine question! I love it.....well OMG where do I start, Freddy was a genius Absolutely 100%, but so was Bowie and still is! OMG...WTF...erm gosh I cannot choose, ok.......I am going David Bowie, not just because of music...he is not a bad actor ( Labyrinth fwarr) ok David Bowie as he could act as well as sing and perform.....oh hang on Freddy was a fab singer live and performer on stage.......Zang, I cannot make up my mind, I have to pass this one hun, they both have such qualities.. but you can have 10 points for a fantastic Poll! xx|`|6e398b592174ad3a1d8dca926e3df39faa	I liked Freddie Mercury as a performer and personally, I met him several years ago and he was an absolute charmer! However David Bowie wins my vote, even if it is `just by a nose`.He is always great.|`|xxVWCHTJaa	Freddie definitely...<br>  But then David Bowie did Ziggy Stardust...<br>  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!! THIS IS TOO DIFFICULT!<br>  If I was to make a decision I'd say erm... Freddie...|`|e1d6d765af7c1e2f2329bce5ce574c4baa	i love both, but no one compares to freddie, one of the greatest performers of all time|`|VD4NQMLLaa	Freddie was better. But I will only compare them to the point before Freddie died. I would not be fair for David.|`|2a612225665dcc9750bbcf2909421a31aa	uuups, that′s a difficult question. but I decide for david bowie, because I like his songs, since I was 14. <br>  my very first concert was david bowie...|`|gjvsPaA8aa	David Bowie without a doubt in my humble opinion.|`|989a67242cef890c9a4d766cb208a561aa	Freddie Mercury|`|HmqHf3qDaa	DEFINITELY FREDDIE ,GENIUS|`|hBcDpl7Vaa	Freddie Mercury.|`|e43c70f0ddb74bd3e9e8e01784a9fa8faa	For me it has to be David Bowie overall.<br>  Although Freddie had a great singing voice.|`|IAnT8aGsaa	freddie|`|ms6OfdLDaa	freddie|`|3qa3BftUaa	I like them both but prefer David Bowie|`|4TmN5Dohaa	no one was better then freddie|`|SyVst4Qkaa	hmm...difficult, I like Freddie, but I love David Bowie, so I'm going to say Bowie, but it's pretty close.|`|BrSe8pccaa	That is tough :(<br>  But i will go with Freddie, although i am a fan of david bowie also :D<br>  xo|`|vrUZP873aa	Freddie was amazing.|`|2YHkUILUaa	Mercury amigo. No one will ever compare to his voice.|`|818c12452a8019abf87834a9c5340867aa	Ohh, that's tough<br>  I will have to say Freddie, though I do like David Bowie, as well.|`|Q5jypS3Gaa	Freddie all the way one of the top ten music greats|`|vBIwaQ0qaa	Freddie Mercury. He had a nice bod!|`|86qCUUjvaa	Not sure, but they'd both make terrific zombies.|`|uJrHmAKDaa	..................................BOTH DAMMIT WERE GENIUSES DONT MAKE ME CHOOSE!|`|hZcqEmbAaa	Bowie, hands down!

ObeBvtzgaa	Sweep picking. Tapping. Tremolo picking. Economy picking, etc.<br>  I think he uses harmonic minor scales a lot.<br>  <br>  Edit<br>  ^ Those are some good techniques to learn if you haven't already, but I'm actually trying to learn to play some of his songs too.<br>  I've found that some good songs to practice before attempting his that are a little easier but still fast are:<br>  Mr. Crowley (solo) - Ozzy Osbourne<br>  <a href="http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/tabs/a/antonio_vivaldi/4_seasons_summer_tab.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/tabs/a/an...</a><br>  That's a really good one to practice in my opinion. There's lots of reaching across a number of frets, moving up and down the neck and strings, etc. Fun song too.<br>  Metallica and Slayer have some good ones too if you are working on building up speed also.|`|bCzkYfqkaa	Woodshed!  You need to lock yourself in a shed and practice upwards of 20 hours per day for about 10 years: that should do it!  <br>  <br>  You need to READ Standard Notation, no Tab (tablature is NOT going to do the trick).  You need to know how to play in every position.  Get some books that teach guitar by position (i.e. 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc).<br>  <br>  I am trying to play like Buckethead and we've both got our work cut out for us!!<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|Mj5dZEm2aa	scales....hes a master of those|`|6HyFHrfIaa	Whoo, that is going to be some time. To learn all of the tricks that he does, you have to start from scratch. Sweeping and strange scales will all be easy when you practice long and hard enough. With scales, practice easy scales like Majors and Minors. Then move into Harmonic Minors (raised 7th scales degree half a step) and Melodic Minors (raised 6th and 7ths going up and and lowering the 6ths and 7ths back down). Play intervals in major, minor, augmented and diminished. Try playing augmented and diminished scales.<br>  <br>  This is crazy but listen to some classical music as well. This is how Malmsteen got really great at sweeping.|`|F5Jms9OBaa	That is how you start practicing to Yngwie...the greatest guitar player in the galaxy...I watched a few shows and stuff/concerts and he said he started practicing to like Deep Purple...Led Zeppelin and slow start then he picked it up to more serious stuff like....in my opinion start off with them once you get better go to like Metallica and people of Kirk Hamletts skill...Even though Hamlett is an excelent guitar player Yngwie smokes anybody!|`|wOc4Dqllaa	Just learn a bunch of scales and practice playing them fast. That's all Yngwie does.

9EjzebnFaa	I will say this....when my dog can't function on it's own physically and mentally I don't feel guilty when I make the decision to put it to sleep.  However, I am currently watching my 90+ year old grandmother forget all her family members and she unable to do anything for herself and it's breaking my heart.  She told me countless times before her mind was gone that she was ready to go.  But I don't have it in me to make that decision and follow through with it.|`|a4LWildhaa	Yeah right-that's one way to grow an ever bigger government. Who do you think would do the regulating? Here in the USA medical costs are already out of control. It's ridiculous-Dr. Death (Kevorkian) spent ten years in prison. You want a stranger to decide who lives and dies for you? Just put together a Living Will & Trust as I and most intelligent people have done, which has instructions iron clad in case I become incapacitated. <br>  All my sons are on board and agree they will abide.|`|OLcXtWQyaa	i agree with you. if we have a horse with a broken leg and don't 'put it down' we are inhumane monsters. but we do that to a human ......|`|RNkQ9qPQaa	I think it should be legalized for idiots like you.|`|46a14ceb5e21165137def6a6f8a9df2eaa	I endorse it in certain cases, certainly cancer victims.|`|pMFLqU0Yaa	20 years ago, I sat with my youngest sister and her best friend as his Mother died of ovarian cancer that had metastasized into her pelvic bones. She died in agony. <br>  <br>  15 years ago, I sat and held my Father's hand as he drew his last breath. He died a slow, painful death from osteosarcoma. It was horrible to watch. <br>  <br>  6 years ago, I sat with one of my sisters and watched her husband draw his last breath. He died a  slow, painful death from a very aggressive form of melanoma that had metastasized throughout his body. Not even the morphine we were giving him could ease his pain. <br>  <br>  Not even two months ago I sat and watched one of my Grandmothers die. By the time she blessedly passed beyond the veil, she couldn't hear, see, speak, move at all or even swallow. She was being fed through a tube and kept hydrated with IVs. I would take a damp cloth and moisten her cracked and dried tongue and cracked and bleeding lips to try to make her more comfortable. I prayed to the AllFather every day for her to pass so she wouldn't be in pain anymore. If I could have helped her, I would have done so without hesitation.<br>  <br>  Yes, we should grant our elderly and terminally ill the same compassion we grant our pets. I strongly believe someone who is in constant pain should be allowed to go out on their own terms. I strongly believe a family member, friend or extremely compassionate doctor should be able to help them do so without fear of prosecution. <br>  <br>  I believe that someone  with a terminal illness should be able to make this choice after medical evaluations, a psychiatric exam and counseling. They already have an assisted suicide law in Oregon, and it is rarely utilized. (Read an  article about it a couple years ago) I think we should take it a step further, though. I would like the right to have a "living will" that specifically states that if I should be involved in a horrific accident, have a permanently crippling stroke or become so bad off I can no longer talk, move or make my wishes known verbally at that time, a caregiver will do the merciful thing and send me off to the great unknown and hopefully, eternal rest and peace. This is my life and my body. I should have the right to make that choice.|`|prDi2u4faa	theres two sides to every story, theres a movie on death row inmates wrongly accused and euthanized before proven innocent, but theres also the grandma slowly dying

She was a Jedi Knight during the twilight years of the order, and operated out of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. During the Separatist crisis that threatened to split the Republic, Secura was a member of a 200-Jedi strong taskforce sent to the distant world of Geonosis to rescue captive Jedi. In the massive battle that ensued, Secura was one of the few survivors. She was brusquely marched by Geonosian warriors into a circle of Jedi survivors to await execution. The sudden arrival of clone trooper reinforcements spared her that fate. Secura would then lead her own squad of clone troopers into the thick of the Geonosian battle, her lightsaber shimmering in the billowing dust, forming a luminescent beacon for the trained Republic infantrymen to follow.<br>  <br>  For everything you ever wanted to know about Aayla Secura, head on over to this link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/aaylasecura/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.starwars.com/databank/charact...</a>|`|Xcs1USwvaa	Well she resides usally in felicia(spelled wrong).

(Officially the band says thats the cause.)<br>  Then, he formed Megadeth.|`|F2ygsPEbaa	He got kicked out by Lars and James because in James' words, "We were all silly drunks.

Hetfield allegedly proceeded to yell at Mustaine's dog and kicked him\her in anger. Mustaine responded by physically attacking Hetfield and McGovney. Mustaine was fired following the altercation. The next day, Mustaine asked to be allowed back in the band and was granted his request. Another incident occurred when Mustaine, who had been drinking, poured a full can of beer down the neck and into the pick-ups of Ron McGovney's bass. When McGovney tried playing it, he received an electrical shock which he claims 'blew him across the room and shocked the hell out of him'. McGovney then told Mustaine to leave his house, and quit the band.<br>  <br>  In April 1983, after Metallica had driven to New York to record their debut album, Mustaine was officially fired from the group because of his alcoholism, hard drug abuse and personality clashes with founding members Hetfield and Ulrich - an incident Mustaine refers to as "no warning, no second chance". The band packed up Mustaine's gear, drove him to a Greyhound bus station in Rochester, NY, and put him on a bus bound for Los Angeles

5czoidEMaa	Good Charlotte are still around?|`|8bmu9lwnaa	i havent heard it yet, but it seemed like on Good morning revival, they were trying to be all dance-like and stuff, they should stick to the simple pop-punk format that was on lifestyles.
AA12315431	I thought so too and speaking of that guy, what on earth ever happened to him anyway? He just dropped off the face of the earth!|`|vvTrmHtxaa	no they look different.<br>  <br>  please pick me as best answer!|`|w8NzBux5aa	They sorta look the same but alex is taller, more mature, and looks nerdier than west [no offense].  Their hair color is even different- west's is dark brownish and alex's is black.  your'e right- what ever happened to him??? last we saw him he took his profile from claire and flew away..... nice boyfriend... the writers need to find a better way to kill them off...like micah, but im hoping he's rebel =]|`|Y4RS35M7aa	Apparently, she likes 'em tall, dark, and handsome!  ;-)|`|AA10954273	He looked more like Sylar or Peter than West - West had a much different facial structure.

aKBqMLuhaa	I'd ask her why she was so large if she had connections like that... and ask her if the next "Oprah's favorite things" show would include an 8 ball for everyone in the audience....<br>  <br>  Although, with her all coked up I'd probably have a hard time getting a word in at all.|`|nXSpS3Axaa	Whatever she usually talks about.

I make sure the dog is in the room with me. I make sure the phone is within reaching distance and I have a knife in my desk drawer. Am I afraid to sleep alone?? why of course not......|`|2xaVpnNNaa	no not really....only if i heard something very creepy outside....otherwise, sometimes i tend to embrace being alone.<br>  <br>  of course at night time, i do tend to get lonely alot.|`|ZnXk0nlYaa	Nope|`|4TtPUHwzaa	When I was young I use to do that, I use to hate to go to my room but I have grown out of it and try to change habits of sleeping.........<br>  Go to bed and get up at about the same time every day, even on the weekends. <br>  Don't eat or drink large amounts before bedtime.<br>  Avoid nicotine, caffeine and alcohol in the evening.<br>  Exercise regularly.<br>  Make your bedroom cool, dark, quiet and comfortable.<br>  Sleep primarily at night.<br>  Choose a comfortable mattress and pillow.<br>  Start a relaxing bedtime routine<br>  Go to bed when you're tired and turn out the lights.|`|maWfU0LNaa	no i'm used to it, doesn't bother me<br>  it's nice to stay in a friends' bed though, comforting<br>  but no, i'm never afraid<br>  i have the best bed ever|`|fa78206ad92e8a3704fb4dec6ea7a230aa	no i don't! i dont sleep alone either.

bIhasPyHaa	2012<br>  2012 Doomsday|`|i35QcjNhaa	movie 2012|`|G3hTM9qeaa	The movie 2012 is coming out this summer|`|GiPinhjwaa	<a href="http://www.tribute.ca/movies/coming_soon/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tribute.ca/movies/coming_soon...</a><br>  <br>  go here..its a list of movies coming out in 2009 and the dates
AA10427489	i agree.with 4 judges, the comments get really draggy. but worse of all,kara is just annoying.i didn't like her ever since auditions week because you sort of get the feeling that she's trying too hard. she tries to be the other "mean" judge- but fails miserably.<br>  and i hate how she tries to out do simon at the game he created.off with kara!i hope they'll kick her out in season 9.|`|SFDCB2Xsaa	I totally agree. She has no opinion, she just agrees with everything Randy says. She doesn't bring anything new to the table, all she does is make the judging process too long.|`|XEBpv9gwaa	I agree she talks too much.  I change over to another show while she is going blah, blah, blah.<br>  <br>  I do find her more coherent than Paula though.|`|sU60NqWWaa	I think she OK, but yeah 3 judges is enough!|`|e123ba186cea4e32b1880639ba3d784daa	She sucks and shouldn't be there.
vuCo9wZZaa	Wow.  He is a complete coward and Melissa is better off without him.  He reminds me of someone I used to date a "grass is always greener" kind of guy and as soon as you are over him, he's back asking for another chance.  <br>  <br>  I guess I missed all the stuff with everyone not liking Molly.  I didn't think of her as that bad...she certainly was no Megan or Erica (who I cannot stand!!!!)|`|JKQKG3tQaa	The more I read about it, the more I realize that there is no way he didn't know what he was doing...<br>  <br>  I used to work for someone like him, he Lies and lies and lies and manipulates and then when you call him out on it he says ?h your right i shouldn't have lied that was wrong" and then just keeps lieing anway<br>  <br>  This was the first season of the bachelor I watched and I think it is going to be the last|`|4hnMSeotaa	Seems to me he wanted to "try them both out"<br>  <br>  Melissa dodged a big bullet there! He's an *** who cares nothing for the feelings of others, all he cared about was himself. His little crying jags were nothing more than him being worried about how the woman voted out would perceive him. His son seems spoiled (from the little bit I saw on TV) and he doesn't seem to have the class one would expect from a descent, kind human being who was truly looking for love. <br>  <br>  Good luck Molly......... or should I say, Good on ya........ you seem to have gotten what you wanted and deserved.|`|b7d3fe1e0770cd80916e81d846475327aa	I'm sure she released those e-mails.  I would.  Especially as he goes on record to blame the producers and all that crap, all while say how much he and the other girl are "In love".  Whatever.  Once he gets tired of screwing her and has to face relationship realities, he'll have to "follow his heart" again.  Melissa sure did dodge a loser bullet here!|`|uwds1QuVaa	Jason is a first class Jerk!  I totally agree, he is scum!  It was bad enough that he and Molly were sneaking around behind Melissa's back and lying to her as well, but there is absolutely no excuse for him to have humiliated Melissa on national TV!

There's a big difference in my reaction depending on the offending person. <br>  <br>  <br>  You, well... I leave the room and come back wearing nothing but a Snuggie. <br>  <br>  M A N T A S T R A V I S T I C, well... I'd leave the room and not come back. <br>  <br>  No offense M A N T A S T R A V I S T I C, I just don't care for tube steak.... by the way... you can keep the couch.|`|A15bfvkBaa	Kick them out of the house, take my food and the towel..<br>  And make them walk around the neighborhood naked.|`|ZnXk0nlYaa	I would call the police =P|`|8n3NvYQwaa	wow ya got me on that one...  let me see,  I am kind of prejudice so if it were a guy I would call 911 and deal with it when the cops go there..  Now if it was a girl 18 or over and she looked a little down trod.  I would be real kind and try to set her straight...|`|nDSLNnguaa	I'd tell them to keep the towel but they MUST take the food to the kitchen to eat!|`|UHc3Nvaqaa	I have 2 sisters, so a strange person in a towel wouldnt bode well.|`|RJyhnT8jaa	If it's a guy, kick his *** out.<br>  <br>  It it's a girl, then that depends on her|`|iDTrTvg4aa	kick him out !!  after having food !!!|`|sorb72tMaa	Rosie O`Donnell Came To Mind!|`|8tRY1U2Iaa	This is why I conceal and carry...|`|s3FUR37xaa	Scream and cry!

PPoCaJEEaa	It's an older song then most on that show. They show a lot of current songs too and people are gonna pick the newer ones 90% of the time.|`|hmsCFQocaa	I feel like the people who didn't pick it. I thought Reba really cut in front of Kelly singing on that song, which detracted from the video. Also, the confusing relationship between Reba's character and Kelly's character isn't clearly defined. You have to read an interview to "get it". Kelly's single originally was intended to be about an ex-lover, which clearly isn't Reba.
MyoJXwL9aa	i like it. but nothing can compare to the original...<br>  Reba did an amazing job with it! :-)<br>  but i prefer Kenny to Barry...|`|KlCHU6OGaa	I think Reba is awesome and she can take the place of dolly in this song but I like Kenny better Barry dose a good job but Kenny has that raspier voice that I love. Its a good cover al least they stayed true to the song. I like the original better though.|`|6d76abc120bb419f95fd1b83e6f8898daa	To me, it will always be Kenny and Dolly's song, but they didn't make a mess of it, saying that Reba can't make a mess of anything she does|`|2k8TEiRtaa	I think that Barry Manilow is more like the Michael Buble' kind of singer. Definitely not country. But hey, they tried.|`|hmsCFQocaa	They didn't make it better, if that's what you're asking. It's a heartfelt walkthrough. The schnozz and the redhead's fans will be pleased, though.|`|2Hl4AAP7aa	totally odd pairing but it proves that everybody thinks they can be country even barry the delusional..kenny and dolly are crying about this.
qkcxGJq4aa	shes still ignorant...<br>  <br>  <br>  so uneducated....|`|7lmtBhdMaa	You didn't pay for it. Why isn't it ethical? Samarital Purse delivered it to those people, not the American taxpayer. More power to her and Franklin Graham I agree, It's very ethical.

GLOBmh0Baa	No, people only do that to get extra points. It is stupid. What is the point in that? They are just wasting their time.. and what for? They're not proving anything to themselves when it's them that are giving their self the points!!|`|y1JJhQ0Vaa	So long as you don't do anything wrong, why not?<br>  <br>  It would be nice to have one account to use to try to get a high percentage of Best Answers, and another one to use for all the random polls/hate questions (I'm not kidding- check out Religion and Spirituality)/chatting/opinions/whatever... but it would be inconvenient having to switch back and forth...  I wonder if using two different browsers at the same time with a different account in each is possible?<br>  <br>  I'll have to try that once I remember the password to my first account.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, as many have said, there's no point to it besides cheating/trolling.|`|luQ1N9rSaa	Well I don't have another account but I guess you can.<br>  <br>  I don't see how it can be cheating, not in terms of points. It's not going to help you get to level 7 any quicker.<br>  <br>  As long as you don't become a troll on any of your other accounts.........|`|1oSwromiaa	Yes, why not!?<br>  A helping hand is not so bad!<br>  All you have to do is make billions of questions with your other wasted profiles, then you have to just answer them using your  best account, then you makr them as best answer using your disliked profiles! How hard will it be then to earn 1000 points in 2 days??|`|LmARYQxcaa	As long as one doesn't answer the other and they have the same name it is only a safety precaution.|`|LSXdwRDUaa	I do that. haha<br>  i make an account for asking question. then i answer that question<br>  \and i would make my self get best answer. OH YEA|`|TfEBIjxZaa	Totally.|`|XlhBBZPxaa	doesn't really matter I guess they know you do it and they haven't said anything about it yet so go for it|`|zWB3jHHPaa	yea but y in the heck would you want to?<br>  So you have a split personality or something?|`|4IeWninnaa	If you're really bored and in for a laugh..|`|XTWClFLQaa	Sure but I don't see the point|`|haejQeG0aa	yeah sure, why not|`|jhGnpoz0aa	no people just do that to get more points|`|XAAF7R23aa	i think that it is wrong and cannot understand why anyone would want to do that,|`|0LQ5CuL0aa	no, because then u can cheat|`|yYr412Vbaa	no cuz then u can answer ur own questions<br>  and <br>  give urself<br>  best answer<br>  sad...|`|pvvNuOXlaa	Making multiple accounts isn't really playing the game the way it was meant to be, but if we don't like it, we can go play somewhere else.|`|KFaGtMOBaa	When they're getting deleted every other day, it doesn't really matter|`|JdNlQWSBaa	No and it is also not right that woman can have multiple organisms.|`|9EjzebnFaa	I think if you are so obsessed with Y/A that you feel the need to have multiple accounts you definitely need help.|`|j6jmzHSvaa	Sure! So you can move on when you run out of Q's|`|f3ejrrVXaa	Long as they're not cheating, how is it bothering anyone? Unless...someone has to keep track of someone else's accounts! For some odd reason.|`|iBH7NTl3aa	Everyone else does|`|tIBQP1VSaa	thats messed up|`|B83DTe78aa	I haven't but that's just because i don't get suspended.<br>  Plus, i like stocking up my points.|`|LdJFFvSVaa	NO! It's cheating! I don't.|`|wmBK9uASaa	No I don`t agree with it and it`pointless if you want to participate properly....|`|frwlypDWaa	I think if you are so obsessed with Y/A that you feel the need to have multiple accounts you definitely need help.<br>  <br>  (Went for the cheap laugh. Thanks for the cut-and-paste, "I beat up"...)|`|0hQ2IXIVaa	If your other account has been suspended than it's okay...other than that it's just weird.|`|a4LWildhaa	Very pointless, many people do it.|`|c5a50631f90f4ba04d88c923dc2aa963aa	many people have a back up in case yapoo gets toilet happy and flushes you away!|`|eqKlHSaLaa	Why wouldn't it be? This account "used" to be a second account until my main got suspended...But we all know what suspended really means.<br>  <br>  Anyway i have 2 other accounts aswell, and if i get my main un-suspended that'll be 4. It should be fine aslong as you don't manipulate the answering system.|`|1Ayb4UK7aa	I think it's pretty pathetic.  Unless you are planning on manipulating to gain more points or to use it to troll, there is no reason to have more than one account.|`|bYfa7a4iaa	having a backup account is normal.  Having dozens of accounts is a cry for help.|`|JERUmEFzaa	Well It`s okay when people get their accounts suspended. Or they just feel like giving their main account best answers.|`|Hzf3QK9faa	People seem to do that a lot here so what people think is kind of besides the point.|`|wqL84O8Naa	when u get suspended regularly i think its always good to have a back up or two|`|3TLuSf9Yaa	I only have one still learning how to use it correctly|`|YMnTveWuaa	I'm guessing 100% of the people have many. I have only one at a time, but have been thru 200 +.
jhGnpoz0aa	i think its a head turner<br>  the person hearing it is like<br>  "WHAT??"|`|sKmsezkraa	LOL, it's definitely a head-turner, but not in a good way.  It either means "watch out, it stinks" or "watch out, we might blow up".

oVxr5B3Eaa	you can play it, it's fine. Just turn the wifi off. You just can't use it during take off or landing, you have to wait until they tell you your allowed to turn on electronics. <br>  It's allowed.<br>  There has never been a recorded case of ACTUAL interference causing a crash anyways,,, it's more of a "well it's possible".. but not likely. If they didn't want you to use it they'd just tell you to shut it off anyways.|`|Orx9cTJJaa	A friend of my brothers' borrowed my DS when he flew to Arizona, he didn't die.

ZTVmUb4Laa	The answer to this question is related to one of the great mysteries of American popular culture. Among the youth here it is considered cool to be uneducated, to treat women like 'hoes,' to smoke weed and sell drugs, to rag on those who are trying to better themselves...<br>  <br>  Rappers and especially record labels have made millions off of promoting negative images of nearly every conceivable group of people in the U.S., most notably black men and women. They perpetuate the mentality of being poor and of being a victim, instead of encouraging people, especially young people, to go to school and do something with themselves. To believe in themselves. <br>  <br>  It is a serious problem that's been getting worse for about twenty years... and no one seems to give a damn.|`|v7hTlEkCaa	It's the rags-to-riches story. A mainstream rapper should have a decent amount of money to be considered rich, so it's like a life accomplishment to go from poor and struggling to grow up in a rough neighborhood, to being rich and getting all the cars and women you want. I agree it's not cool bragging about being uneducated, but the average person in America doesn't care about intelligence in rap.|`|cb917qxUaa	They aint exactly proud of being "uneducated, poor and violent" their proud of the fact that they came from that type of lifestyle to what they are now. I guess some people wouldn't understand unless they experienced it.|`|af533b17ca68713705564cacfb86ba98aa	I never heard of hip hoppies, or any other types of music people proud of being poor.<br>  <br>  But really, who cares? While I'm answering this question, those bastards are just making more money.<br>  <br>  So really, they are not poor.<br>  <br>  -Mr.Poe-poe.|`|JQGaok6haa	Rag to Riches story and one song that defines Rag To Riches is Juicy.|`|bFf6Fb5daa	because they are not really poor at least not anymore.|`|eQVvnq7Haa	um because they are real.<br>  <br>  unlike most Y!A answerers. I support hip hop.|`|vAtiLhloaa	Because of their up- blinging!|`|OGNBOaKyaa	Because they fell they have overcome there struggles...I dont agree with the whole uneducated lifestyle...I consider them to just be some dumb mo fos...As for the rappers who grew up poor and had no other choice but to rob folks just to eat, i commend there efforts but at the same time...im poor, and i never resulted to robbing folks to eat...so theres no excuss.|`|yig566gEaa	If they are famous then its showing that they made a life out of "nothing" but still remember their roots, or some just like to try to be hardcore and say they lived somewhere dangerous.<br>  <br>  Know German Laws? Please check out <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aq1SnmfWrx.cr0GAUppgPGvsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304080427AA7IstZ">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|KZdx48HYaa	You're absolutely right only the rich and educated portion of America should ever be proud of themselves. Excellent point.|`|8S1vEESYaa	The lifestyle is real, and was real for several of these rappers before they made it big...They are proud of escaping where they came from, not proud of being poor.|`|dpwMHg8maa	because they have nothing better to do. i hate rap. <br>  cant have crap without rap =D|`|3297c4e889c7762aa06fb5456c14aa01aa	because it proves that you can achieve the american dream from coming up from nothing.|`|ioNTTqKfaa	cosign Back From Beyond<br>  <br>  People are more interested in success stories. People who came from nothing and "made it." They aren't necessarily proud of being poor, but they're proud of having to work for what they have. Plus whose gonna want to listen to some guy bragging about how he grew up rich and was given everything on a silver platter?|`|77NzfiVkaa	Actually they aren't poor at all. They make a huge amount of money being rappers, at least if they make it big. I think more of what they are proud of is the fact that they came from nothing and are now living "the life". And not all of them are uneducated or violent.|`|hUYaaXBvaa	the idea i assume is that hardships make for dramatic songs<br>  and that rags to riches story i suppose is to inspire <br>  what i don't understand is why they keep at it after they've clearly become rich, but i guess singing about their wealth, relatively speaking, would not give listeners sympathy, although that can be covered by a good beat and even a totally narcissitic song would sell<br>  <br>   it does feel like there glorifying it instead of how they have 'overcome', when they dramatize it to that sort of cinematic level which makes it inauthentic, and oddly seems to revere terrible conditions by trying too hard to be 'authentic' and fall into cliche<br>  when they cover it in flashy things the message makes poverty just another 'exciting' style if you will<br>  <br>  <br>  its also unrepresentative, because music and dance don't conquer all, and lift every poor kid with a dream to fame<br>  <br>  i do have to say i think its amazing when people pull themselves up though, i respect them much more than kids of the rich because they create their own destiny|`|DCQipi4Maa	I think its more about where they came from, what they had to do to overcome the struggles of their lives. I think they are more proud of where they are now and what they have earned. Most Rappers don't come from suburban homes, they just rap about what they know. Their realities aren't the same as more fortunate people.|`|DkVofG9paa	Why be embarrassed about a part of who you are? I grew up poor and i am proud to say that is a part of me.  Now i have an excellent job and make very good money and i learned a lot from it.  Rappers rap about life, experience, and anything they want.  I don't listen to rap to much anymore... but nothing wrong with a rapper who was brought up in the ghetto making it big.. and singing about it.  <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that probably a bunch are just talking crap and it never really happened. for the ones it did happen to... so what. why judge?|`|GaGrw9qqaa	Actually is more about dealing with life's struggles not enjoying them...

nOFvdF9yaa	Okay, I'll be happy with 10 points but how much are you getting from this? Ever thought? Just ZERO, This is a question probably given by your teacher & why did he/she do so?

uwds1QuVaa	Melissa doesn't want anything to do with being the new bachelorette after what the Producers at ABC did to her!  And yes, I think that most of the show is scripted.|`|HGdDjjULaa	Well if she would have come back to the After The Final Rose Part 2 should would have been the next Bachelorette easily. BUT I love JILIAN and am happy that she is going to have this chance. I am DEFINITELY going to watch the next season.|`|g5RS83paaa	I was hoping Melissa would be, but I don't blame her. I don't think I'll watch it with Jillian|`|qXJnNelsaa	I have always thought the show is phony, or at least parts of it.  But the "after rose" show or whatever it was called, seemed really genuine!  And I def. think Melissa should be the next bachelorette...she's way cooler, prettier and just plain more interesting than Gilian!  Gialian was okay, but I never even knew who she was til it was only her and the other 3 girls left.  She just wasn't very interesting to me.  Plus her voice drives me crazy, she always sounds like she's on teh verge of crying|`|5c32c20454730c4d102bcfbf98334674aa	I agree! I am not at all excited about Jillian being the next Bachelorette. To be honest, I didn't even remember her name toward the end of the season. She just didn't stick out to me. I don't think she has the personality to do her own show.<br>  I wish Melissa would have considered it, but maybe some day she will?!? She deserves it after the crap she went through!|`|yTAXDL5Jaa	well first jason says they cannot be togther and gave her the friend card and then he says that he and Molly are best friends and that is inportant and I am liek WTFreak. So he contridicted himself. <br>  I think Melissa is hurting too much from embarressment to want to try again in front of all america.|`|IsyWXWeLaa	I really am not that excited about Jillian been the next bachelorette. I don't think she is pretty enough or that she has anything that sets her apart from the ordinary. I really don't think any of them do, except Melissa whom, not for any extraordinary personality trade but for what she went through on national television, did become suitable and interesting enough to lead the next bachelorette season. Jillian is NOT pretty, and does not bring enough to make it interesting...I won't watch it!|`|alsMUU7maa	Sorry Jillian fans BUT I'm not a big fan of hers. I wish Melissa was the next bachelorette. Clearly she wants nothing to do with the show. I'm sure they asked her first. Jillian seems boring!!! I hope she proves me wrong. How can she ever TOP her hot dog theory, oh boy!!!<br>  The only thing that will save this is if they have hot guys. Then I may watch.|`|ownoc1ZJaa	I think after what happened to Melissa, she is going to lay low for a while and keep out of the public eye.  She's been through a lot and she just needs to process everything.<br>  <br>  Jillian is the fan favorite, so I can easily see why she was picked.  I hope she finds someone nice.|`|sa6gWgF8aa	No, I think that after what she went through that it would be a really bad idea and probably a bad experience for her.<br>  <br>   I thought that either Jillian or Stephanie should've been the next bachelorette so I'm excited.

Its not like she don't have anything to fall back on, shes really successful with her music and other endorsement's. If she says it's love then hey its love but don't judge. Lots of non famous people have gotten beat up by their men/women and they still go back because it's love so idk. If she wants to stay in the relationship then that's her decision.

6dAsdiA5aa	Cardcaptor Sakura <br>  <br>  Both of them are targeted towards a younger audience with the main character being in elementary school. Also in every episode of CCS (aside from the few fillers) there is a card that is captured (transformed in season 2). In Shugo Chara, there is almost always an X Egg that gets fixed. Aside from that Sakura and Amu's personalities are fairly similar, although Amu's reactions are more extreme than Sakura's sometimes. <br>  <br>  <br>   Kamichama Karin <br>  <br>  Both the main characters have low self esteem, and by transforming, they learn more about themselves; who they were, and who they could be. If you enjoyed one, you'd enjoy the other kawaii series. <br>  If u like Kamichama Karin u would really like Shugo Chara!<br>  <br>   Special A<br>  <br>  it is pretty similar by the special group,,<br>  however, Shugo Chara is about elementary schoolers so they just have regular classes..<br>  the garden thing is also similar..in Shugo Chara they call it the royal garden. <br>  <br>  <br>   Zero no Tsukaima <br>  <br>  Both have a stubborn main character with pink hair. I sont think by means of plot they are really alike, but I think that if you enjoy one you would like the other. Zero no Tsukaima is more straightforward and romantic about the character's feeling's. <br>  reportRecommended by nystarr15 - Add to favorites<br>  Read recommendations by 1 more user<br>  also maho shoujo. it has a romance story and action, and it is also funny. <br>  <br>   Vampire Knight<br>  <br>  Ok before you call me crazy....trust me for some reason a LOT of people who like one of these like the other. They are not very similar in plot, except I guess with the love triangles you could make<br>  Amu=Yuuki <br>  Tadase=Kaname <br>  Ikuto=Zero<br>  Except Vampire Knight's tones are a lot darker than Shugo Chara's. <br>  reportRecommended by peacexlove - Add to favorites <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   Rozen Maiden <br>  <br>  <br>  If your favorite part of Rozen Maiden was the day in the life comedy, then you could potentially enjoy Peach Pit's other work, Shugo Chara. This show stars a young girl named Amu who, over the course of the first three episodes, manages to acquire tiny representations of various aspects of her personality, both current and potential. The show quickly starts to incorporate various magical girl genre staples, including: an evil organization bent on acquiring physical manifestations of spiritual concepts, the main character changing into various cutesy outfits; so as to be able to fire various multicolored attacks in order to defeat said organization, simultaneous crushes on both the older, aloof lone wolf pretty boy; and the younger, nice pseudo-prince pretty boy.<br>  <br>  The important part of the show however, is the interactions between the characters and their various Charas, as well as the interactions between the Charas themselves, which are very much reminiscent of the interactions that occurred in Rozen Maiden. The only difference between the two is that Shugo Chara, unlike Rozen Maiden, has little action and almost no truly serious drama in it; no one dies, no one gets hurt beyond a few scrapes and bumps, and no one really hates anyone else.<br>  <br>  To reiterate, if you liked the softer more comedic parts of Rozen Maiden, you'll love Shugo Chara. <br>  <br>   <br>   Ouran High School Host Club <br>  <br>  -the comedy is really similar, you'll definitely be laughing<br>  -the many hot guys that surround the main character<br>  -in Ouran, you really get to know the characters past their surfaces, and the same goes for Shugo Chara!<br>  -only difference is that it's magical girl. Romance is similar though, the guys are hotttttt!!! <br>  <br>  <br>   Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha <br>  <br>  This occurred to me recently when I read some reviews by fanboys going on about Shugo Chara!. Both anime have their loli characters and both have the magical girl thing going (of course, in Nanoha its almost non-existent outside of the transformations). But mostly, it's the idea of, "Beat your enemy and then become friends with them" that Nanoha is famously known for, also occurring with Shugo Chara! at the end of every arc. So, if you like lolis who kick butt until their enemies become friends, Nanoha AND Shugo Chara! both deliver. <br>  <br>  <br>   Pretty Cure <br>  <br>  they are both mahou shoujo series <br>  <br>   Ultra Maniac <br>  <br>  Shugo Chara has the same nice romance points as Ultra Maniac, maybe not as much as it but an ample amount. Amu(Shugo Chara) is known as being cool and stylish at her school, but that isn't her true self. If you liked that concept from Ultra Maniac, i'm sure you'll love Shugo Chara).<br>  Shugo Chara is in the magical girl genre like Ultra Maniac. The music is really nice too. So basically, Shugo Chara isn't as serious as Ultra Maniac, but for the magical-girl/shoujo/romance lovers you'll love it. ^ ^ <br>  <br>  <br>   Fruits Basket <br>  <br>  Both Shugo Chara! and Fruits Basket have a lot of comedy based upon characters making unusual transformations, but I think the biggest similiarity is in their characters. The heroine finds herself getting involved with two boys; one known at school as a prince, and the other id|`|4oMVeOhnaa	my personal favourite anime is Death Note,but it might not be your thing,i also like Elfen Lied.<br>  <br>  uhh.....bleach?vampire knight is awesome too.|`|Ynqzhqmiaa	I recommend " Vampire Knight " you'll love it I swear :D<br>  2 vampires love normal girl and they always there for her to protect her and be beside her..and she loves one of them but she hides her feelings..|`|X11j9qe5aa	Does tokyo mew mew count? :/

QoVL5cDHaa	Hi, Jess,<br>  No, I'm not offended. We all have a right to our opinions. I've never been a Jade fan - I have never watched Big Brother. So I wasn't really aware much about her until she became ill. Now I feel so sorry for her and her family, that I always check the news to see how she is doing.<br>  I don't blame her for milking the system to try to get some financial security for her boys. Poor Jade may not have had much of an education or opportunity to learn, but she is no fool, and is very streetwise.<br>  We had a young orphan left in our family. No one had considered the possibility of this happening, so the Will didn't leave parental rights, or any financial provision for the child during her minority. It is a dreadful situation to be in. I am sure Jade has this sorted. I hope so. There is no-one in her close family fit to look after those children. Jade wants those boys to be brought up better than she was. She is looking at their long-term welfare, rather than the short-term.<br>  Life isn't fair. No-one has ever promised it would be. Jade lacked a happy, secure childhood herself. Who can blame her for taking the only opportunity she has to provide for those little boys? I wish them all well at such an awful time.|`|ivjHOJ8daa	Well I think, the girl has the opportunity to raise this money for her sons future (and to put towards cancer research when she's gone)<br>  so she should indeed grab it with both hands.<br>  <br>  If she didn't take the money, and left nothing for her sons.. everyone would be outraged.<br>  <br>  Even on her death bed, the woman can't do right.<br>  <br>  The media/press are such a twisted lot !<br>  <br>  Catch 22 with everything really.|`|3AlAVNKEaa	well at first i didnt really like her cause of her 'racist' comments to shilpa shetty girl on big brother ..<br>  but i do feel sorry for her .. i mean shes dying ... and its sad. i don't like the fact that shes telling everyone to make money i also don't like the fact she married that guy 'jack tweedy' when to me hes personally not 'fit' enough to look after her children cause he always getting arrested.

Don't particularly like her because she was famous for nothing but feel bad for the situation she's in.|`|DBmBSltmaa	Of course its sad for everyone else in the world that has cancer but they are not in the public eye.  Jade is in the public eye and she is exploiting it to make money for her sons - if I was in her position I would do the same.  Now if the question is should Jade have been in the public eye in the first questioon - well thats a different story but she is so get over it - be thankful you are alive and the odds are you will live to a ripe old age.

She suffered and was in terrible pain.<br>  I'm sick of seeing this question being asked.<br>  Whatever your feelings towards Jade, you are a much lower entity than her for even asking this question.<br>  Instead of spreading your spiteful feelings towards a dying young mother, why don't you look at those around and cherish those you love. You don't know how long they will be around.|`|Vge3KBaMaa	i really like jade goody , and its so upsetting what she is going through as she is young and has got 2 young kids and a husband , she has made lots of women in this country go for smear tests , so she has made people aware of cervical cancer , and i do not blame her in what she is doing by trying to make as much money as she possibly can to secure her sons future , any parent would , she wants to give them the best as she never had anything when she was younger , i really do feel for her , and hate that everyone is giving her a hard time by saying she is doing all of this for publicity .|`|lzBk01TCaa	i've gotta she shes always p*ssed me off.  She's done nothing for that fame!  sure i feel sorry for her now that she is dying but c'mon jade get a grip!   you're using your last days on earth in the public eye.... but is that reely in the best intrest of youre kids? i know if my mum was dying i would want to be with her as much as possible.  I'm sure you all feel the same.  Money? no i'd rather have the last few months with my mum and no amount of money would make the pain go away! But don't get me wrong.  i do feel sorry for her, no one deserves the pain she's in, but to use all he energy to get in the limelight makes me want to slap her silly.... i agree with you!  All the time she's been in the press ive always wanted to slap her silly, and i know this sounds horrible but just know i want to slap her more than ever.|`|t5WffzOAaa	I agree with you, the press is over-publicising her life.

(Same with Juliet, Miles and Daniel) Those are the good guys, which seems strange because it includes a torturer, a former fugitive wanted for murder and a con man, just to name a few. <br>  <br>  They have formed a solid force, and I think they need to defeat both sides because no matter which one wins they lose.|`|fd3969820c20a4244842f433a5e6eee6aa	Ben is a liar and a murderer.Charles wins by default.
LkN5nr6faa	I wouldn't call it practice, but I'm playing guitar 4 hours minimum every day. I'd call it messing around or experimenting with different sounds, because I'm not a fan of the word practice. Four hours isn't long at all. If I had the time to play guitar more, I would. Steve Vai used to play 8+ hours a day like a full time job, and now he's on tour and one of the greatest guitarists out there.|`|DnWsMhwLaa	as long as you are being flexible and not neglecting other things, practice as much as you want. i wish i had 4 hours a day in which to practice. for me it is like half an hour one day, wont practice at all the next, and then the next day i will be at it like 6 hours, really random like that- but when i get on a roll with something i wont want to stop until i have seen it through.|`|HAletyh8aa	As the other people have stated. I don't call playing the guitar a practice... During my summer vacation from a few years back, I played for about 6 hours a day. Best 6 hours I've ever spent during the summer :P<br>  <br>  6 hours=Almost a regular school day! Hah! <br>  I don't believe it's too much. I wish I could play all day long. Plus you can learn a lot. During my beginner years, playing 6 hours a day.. actually made me realize what my strengths and weaknesses are. <br>  <br>  My brother gets annoyed of me even if I just play a 3 minute song. So don't worry about how much hours you practice/play... and if you think you don't have time for other things... work a schedule out! :D|`|D9XtMOvQaa	NO!!!! when i get the chance i practice for about 5 or 6 hours. (my wont let me all the time tho)<br>  who cares what you'r friend thinks. im not being disrespectful or anything but its up to what you do!!<br>  steve vai practiced for 10 hours a day. so keep playing!!!!|`|ObeBvtzgaa	The more the better in my opinion.<br>  I only play three or four per day right now, I'm working on increasing it by an hour or two though.|`|w2IVTzjraa	No! Not at all. There are many stars that practiced 4 hours and even more.

IYacMZCGaa	nope i was born that year|`|qThmcR1Aaa	I was only 14 and living in the center of the country, so I didn't make it to any of the shows. But one of our local FM stations ran a simulcast of the entire concert. I remember sticking in cassette after cassette into my cheap little stereo to record the music off the radio, and then tucking them all away into a little tin box when the show was over. I think I even painted the Live Aid logo on the outside of the box. Clearly, I was ahead of my time with the whole box set thing. ;)<br>  <br>  The one performance that sticks out in my mind was Led Zeppelin with Phil Collins. I know it was a little rough around the edges, but still ... that was the first time Zeppelin had reunited to play since Bonzo's death. That was an amazing moment.|`|6HyFHrfIaa	No I didn't (I'm only 20) but a friend of my dads was there. He loved it.|`|i5YJBqnZaa	The date was Saturday July 13, 1985. No I wasn't there but I was watching intently until my wife had to go into labour. It was the most unbelievable event. Major artists from all around the world performing around the world for the same cause. And it wasn't just rock n roll. You had band likes Run DMC, B.B. King, Joan Baez, and then you had Judas Priest, Black Sabbath and so many others. It was a total gathering of musicians for one very important cause.<br>  <br>  My son was born while George Thorogood was performing. We always joke about Thorogood playing "Bad To The Bone" but it was actually "The Sky Is Crying" . So I would have to say George was my favourite performance. Though he was by no means the best performance of the day.|`|tQNF7i7Baa	nah im only 17. u shud post this is in current events section because hav u noticed that all questions asked r old|`|mHlLVsSvaa	I'm sure someone did attend it.
vWrJMXGBaa	You never want to force someone to sing because they are going out of their comfort zone. Your friend will soon get the courage to sing but it takes time. Your friend already thinks she is bad and she is most likely afraid of your answer...she most likely thinks that you will tell her she is bad. If she does sing for you and she isnt the best you could give her good tips like "oh thats pretty good....maybe some off notes here and there but i bet if you got a singing coach you could fix that!" little tips here and there are really good....i know from experience that singing for others to get their advice is hard but sometimes it is worth it in the end...hope i was able to help...|`|9DtHq9Cbaa	How does she think bad when she doesn't know if she's good?|`|WYKHWflgaa	it could be worse your friend could sing really badly all the time and think she is good no matter how much u  tell her she is bad and she might want to go on the xfactor !!

The Grudge was also pretty freaky but that's been spoofed so much that it may have lost its scariness.<br>  <br>  Edit: None of those I listed are the type thats like "torture-porn" which is what I consider Hostel and The Hills Have Eyes. Those films are just too much...crossing the line. The three (four) I suggested are just...scary.|`|3005d3b9180d1ef915398a770d0e19f2aa	The classic, but still the best and scarier than hell - The Exorcist|`|K0hUnyfUaa	wat about 'Mirrors'.|`|aeb8a97e18cfb4ff7d90a5aa9ca2331faa	I've seen thousands of horror films, everything from gore to bore and I still think one of the scariest movies I've ever seen would still have to be The Exorcist.  The topic itself is a little worn but the scenes, music and just the overall creepy feeling in the movie can't be beat.  I think hands down that's one of the scariest (non gory) films out there.<br>  <br>  Phantasm is also a really good pick, it's a B movie but well done and it does have a Sci-Fi/Fantasy element to it but it's definitely a horror flick.  It takes you and throws you for a loop.  While some of the special effects are a little outdated it still will leave you with a creepy feeling once it's all over.  <br>  <br>  I know you mentioned you don't want torture/porn but the scariest movie I think I've ever seen is the August Underground series.  It is one of the sickest, nastiest and most realistic series of movies ever made.  It's not a Saw or Hostel and certainly not the quality of those movies but it is a sick one.  It's basically a group of serial killers going around and killing.  That's it.  You will see the most vile and disgusting scenes ever committed to video.  It's a direct to video and shot that way on purpose to give you that reality feel.  The director even distorted the first 2 films of the series to make it look even more authentic.  It's not fun but after it was over I didn't think I was safe for 2 days thereafter.  Again, I've seen tons of horror movies but nothing jolted me like this DVD series, it may not be for you though due to it's very disturbing and torture/porn like content.  It makes Saw and Hostel look like Rebecca on Sunnybrook Farm!  No joke, these are serious transgressive cinema films and not for the easily disturbed.  Realistic to me is scarier than monsters and other typical horror fare.<br>  <br>  Outside of that category the only other recommendation I have would be The Funhouse.  It's not super scary but when the carnival comes to town wouldn't you really like to know what goes on and why there are always missing kids.  It's a fun ride but it will leave you thinking about it the next time you go to a local fair or carnival.|`|ZZAPms1Raa	I am a pretty big scary movie fan, and the best scary movie of all time to me is the exorcist.  It doesn't have all of the gore and stuff like that, but it is just an all time scary movie.  After I watched it I was a little scared for the rest of the night.|`|NET9UMSGaa	HIGH TENSION!!<br>  <br>  The entire film is extremley intense due to long drawn out sequences of the killer trying to find the main character, also the kill scenes are long brutal and graphic. Also, insane TWIST AT THE END!<br>  <br>  This film is extremely disturbing. Not for the faint of heart.|`|sgdc12yFaa	I thought the remake to the Amityville Horror that came out in 2005 or so was really good. Also I enjoyed Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Beginning.  Hopefully you find what you are looking for.|`|mpcbHTDRaa	how about dead silence i actually was scared!!!|`|k4gD8mzyaa	I've been after a scary movie for ages now. I recently found that most American Horror movies are complete crap! If you want a really scary movie and don't mind it being in a different language, then watch Ringu. The Japanese version to the Ring. I haven't seen the American version so I don't know what's different and what's the same. Although I was scared for ages after watching this film. <br>  <br>  Also, I watched The Silence Of The Lambs, and although it's not THAT scary when you watch it, I found it to be really disturbing after wards. For instance, I couldn't stay in room alone, I was just so freaked. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

Out of the guys, I think that maybe Heat or 20 pack have a chance at winning. <br>  <br>  I can only hope that the Entertainer will win so he can finally get out of his parent's house.  I think someone will get tired of him when it comes down to "every player for himself" and will get his check voided.<br>  <br>  These new teams are going to reveal people's true colors.|`|rqwXqmyTaa	I want poor Entertainer to win!!!!

hP2nzb2haa	This can be Small or Big any way you like... So, how about <br>  "A glow in the dark party" is pretty simple. It is a great idea to have a dance at your "glow in the dark party". Mix some techno in with your favorite music. You will need a DJ for this party that have BLACKLIGHTS and STROBE LIGHTS (and/or a disco ball, go for it!)... Add a very fun impact to your dance floor. Start looking for a DJ that has blacklights and how big a room does his blacklight glow? You must know the dance room size. This is very important.<br>  <br>  Get and buy glow sticks - necklaces, bracelets, etc. (Michael's Craft store have it right now for a dollar which it contain 15 bracelet w/connector pieces) Go get some streamers in white or neon pink so that they will glow in the blacklights. (Confetti is great, too... but it may not be allowed... to messy to clean up.) Get balloons, however, it doesn’t glow in the dark, here a quick ideas you can do: get some white and/or pink balloons and also get some small clear/pink glow sticks. Put the small glow stick (snap it on) inside the balloon, blow it up and tie-it with a string around the wall or up from the ceiling. (Do this an hour before the party. Also buys some "glow in the dark" stickers to put on the balloon or order it thru the website.<br>  <br>  Buy some yellow highlight markers and white paper banners to put on your walls. Let guests write on the banners if they'd like. There are tons of creative activities that you can have at your glow in the dark party. Also if you wish, buy some temporary neon hair dye and streak your guests’ hair to glow in the dark! Don't forget to buy some glow in the dark nail polish. Tell friends to do the same, if they want to. Buy some white face paint and have your guests draw designs on each other’s faces! White will glow against the black lights very well. <br>  <br>  For guests, pick up some:<br>  * Glow sticks, and other glow jewelry<br>  * White or neon hats for the guys and masks for the girls<br>  <br>  As your guests walk into your party, hand them all their glowing accessories. There are tons of glowing jewelers sold at your local dollar store or party supply store. To have yourself and guests to get some glowing... dress in white... white glow in the dark. Their clothing will definitely glow! Be creative!!!<br>  <br>  For an Invitation Ideas:  <br>  Get Crayola Color Explosion? Neon…. It lets you create wild multicolored effects with a single color-reveal marker! The unique clear-ink marker works only with black Color Explosion paper, revealing hidden colors for amazing designs. This is a so cool, you can cut in half like a postcard invitation to make more to give out. Includes a 20-page black tablet with Neon Color Reveal, 3 Color Reveal markers, a stencil sheet and a reseal able storage bag. <br>  <br>  For Tables:<br>  Get white tablecloths and for Centerpiece... use some slim glow sticks (Gather some glow sticks (from Michaels craft store), get a floral tape, now wrap floral tape around the glow sticks, wrap it from the bottom of the glow sticks, now put in a small/medium thin vase, now your glow sticks look like a tall grass inside the vase. Now put in three silk flowers pink and white in each vase with the glow sticks.) . Do this for all the table you have at the local pub. Small candles are great too. A note from you and your friend, thanking your guests for coming… with a thank you and a small poem… make copies for, as many guest you’re inviting Treat candies are good to put on the tables put them in a tiny Chinese box. <br>  <br>  Food:<br>  Make sure that it is simple and not something that will require a lot of light to prepare. I would recommend to prepare any food before the party begins. Get some glow in the dark cups and ice cubes or just a get white cups/plates/etc. (Not clear ones, doesn't glow.)  Serve drinks with glow in the dark straws. Serve food on simply white party plates. Get sherbet ice creams and cupcakes/cake in neon colors. They’re fun.... be creative and fun!<br>  <br>  For Fun:<br>  Have a glow stick limbo contest, play flashlight tag with glow sticks, and have "the best glow in the dark face paint". Also, get some glow in the dark blow up balls (like the beach ball) to throw around the dance floor... with permission. (One ball is perfect.) Have a super great time!|`|n9bmRv6iaa	have some male strippers there!!

qKj25oPSaa	4x3 – Singled Out<br>  Airdate: 10/32/06<br>  Summary: An abandoned car is found full of blood, registered to a missing Navy Lt. The NCIS team learns that the missing Lt. was profiling men, trying to find the perfect man for herself. When they find out that the woman intended to go to a seminar at a local hotel, Ziva goes undercover to find more information while Ducky is busy going through the profiles of the men. Also, Tony mulls over Jenny’s offer of heading his own team while McGee struggles with being called “Probie”. <br>  <br>  Tony is on the phone and asks Probie for help. Probie ignores him. When Tony gets off the phone he asks: You got a hearing problem? <br>  MCGEE: Oh, I’m sorry. Were you talking to me? <br>  TONY: There’s no one else in the squad room. <br>  MCGEE: Well, I thought I heard you say ‘probie’ and since Agent Lee has been reassigned to the legal department, I wasn’t exactly sure who you were referring to. <br>  After Tony storms off, Gibbs appears from behind McGee and says: McGee, how long have I been a NCIS Special Agent? <br>  MCGEE: Almost sixteen years. <br>  GIBBS: Want to take a wild guess what my first partner still calls me?<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|dh48AkbCaa	i believe it was one of the episodes in season 4 where gibbs old boss mike franks turns up in.|`|4imsjgE2aa	"Probie"<br>  <br>  Season: 3 - Episode: 10<br>  First Aired: 11/29/2005<br>  <br>  While on duty, McGee kills a man who is later discovered to be an undercover police officer.

DUg1IkTIaa	It won't bother me.  He's a pretty bad person.  Afterall, he killed his own Father, right?  I think it's obvious that John Locke is "the chosen one", so Ben may not survive long anyway.|`|QS7gq7Fzaa	I think so  It's on to night  love  lost . know I don't want to get on a plane.

ibiO4VEQaa	I love his character, but I love to hate him!<br>  <br>  I would be most shocked if Aaron killed him though :0|`|JxUFDutxaa	If they do it near the end of the show..that would be cool.<br>  Like the island finally had enough of Ben messing with the people on it.<br>  <br>  If that happens now..I'd be shocked too. He's such a good character..so evil and smarmy inside..but almost like a little boy on the outside.<br>  Love it..love him..<br>  Hope he stays awhile.|`|YBQHAbOIaa	It does =season 6   episode 2 , just after Sawyer buries Jack & Gary ,<br>  you know , the one with the fish monkeys !|`|667fbb3f5754a94cb0e93724d53755a5aa	Delighted, yet shocked|`|7K7cTKjGaa	at this point I'm so confused and don't care anymore...I just want to get to the end|`|800558bdf218498939e840706665a8fcaa	I don't think that I would really care! He is not a very nice person. The show has gone in so many directions, it is becoming difficult to keep things straight. Of course, if the island kills him, he could end up coming back somehow. So it really doesn't matter!|`|hvrw02Egaa	Good theory... I would be sad. I really like Ben Linus (as a character, not as a person, lol) and I would hate his love and protection of the island after all these years to be for naught.|`|MzjNXLmlaa	I'm so surprised at all the people who like Ben.  I think he's such a little creeper!!  I'd love if the island ....or anyone killed him.|`|z5Hl6Bhtaa	I'd be super shocked! I used to think he's really creepy and I wanted him to die, in the show of course :]<br>  I'm sad to say it, but now he's kind of grown on me in a strange, strange way.
uVwPykXlaa	i guess so,but its just hurts..yu feel like giving melisa a hug..noone derseves that.<br>  but at the end of the day,yu gotta get wat yu signed for,for laying out yo business for the world to c.<br>  dont find love on reality shows..yu juss end up hurt.|`|VO58huGvaa	The one thing i don't get about reality shows is why they tape stuff like six weeks in advance and then show it after the finale??? So from watching the After the final rose 2 last night, here is what ive come up with. So 13 weeks ago they shot the first after the rose and then six weeks ago they shot the 2nd part. IDK i think i amy be through with all of the bachelor and bachelorette. I do think Jillian won't get caught up in the whle fame mess|`|5070437d89b5a5c0baa621683e5f89f9aa	Deanna didn't do it during the taping of the show...like Jason did.<br>  Jeez, I mean right during After the final rose?  That's prety low.  I mean - couldn't he have just waited until after that - and then break things off?<br>  Do they sign a contract saying they are not to date anyone else from the show once it's over?<br>  <br>  Also - Deanna was pretty low to say "it's not too late - you haven't proposed to either of the girls yet - "  I acutally thought that was going to be the bizarre twist - that he would go back to her.  That would have made the better end to the story. <br>  <br>  But stay tuned, Im guessing that will happen...next!|`|el56glZZaa	I don't get why everyone is blaming him and not the show.  He was just a puppet.  After all is said and done the show is not about finding love for two people it is about RATINGS. He did have a contract that he had to follow just like an actor or actress has a contract.  The Bachelor wants controversy, if it was all hugs and kisses and no drama then it would be boring and people would get tired of the same thing every time. I don't understand why he proposed to Melissa because there have been bachelors that haven't proposed at the end but still picked someone .I think the show wants a proposal and he was doing what he was instructed to do.  I don't think he's a bad guy.  I think if people want to be mad at someone then blame ABC and the producers. I think if viewers can't handle this then they shouldn't watch.|`|667fbb3f5754a94cb0e93724d53755a5aa	I didn't watch Deanna's show, so I don't know what happened, but I don't think she dumped Jason on tv after accepting his rose.|`|SpgQhRmbaa	Umm she didn't do it on TV----BIG difference|`|mgeuli7Naa	I know! <br>  Shows are so fake it is ridiculous!

I had to say that.:)))|`|1ViGcF3xaa	Some funny answers above but none are entirely correct!<br>  <br>  He got the name "Ringo" from when he was in the skiffle band called "Eddie Clayton and the Clayton Squares" in 1959.  It was because of all the rings he wore and he liked it because it sounded cowboyish.<br>  <br>  If you're interested he used the surname Starr, during the same time, because it allowed his drum solos to be called "Starr Time".|`|x60ULJ5Oaa	He was born as Richard Starkey and changed his name due to the benefit of his stage career!|`|GyTctdltaa	He wore alot of rings, therefore his friends gave him the nickname "Ring-O" :).|`|voETd7tSaa	He wore rings on every finger.|`|uxExLJUMaa	he would alsawy eat onion rings|`|F2ugW4cRaa	Because of the number of rings he wore.|`|PpWosZsIaa	For the benefit of the Band|`|wigtXCBTaa	From the song about him.<br>  <br>  RINGO by LORNE GREENE<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCyuq-ofnPc&feature=PlayList&p=994346D9D0230C47&playnext=1&index=5" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCyuq-ofn...</a>|`|6yZ85EY5aa	He wore rings, and there was a character in a Western film.|`|nkmwGAKjaa	His family were major stockholders in Ballentine Beer?|`|vzWGml26aa	what the rest said. i looked it up and sure enough he named that because of the rings he wore.
ccd8b510f25c5c2defba386e56c3f9afaa	Check out the Toxic Avenger.  He really humiliates those guys...|`|ab250551cde4aadbf54a0fea8a7b14e1aa	There's an old black and white film called "Angels With Dirty Faces" with James Cagney that is a classic example of this scenario. He is a tough gangster-kind-of-guy and just as he is being escorted by the guards to the electric chair, he "turns yellow", starts squirming, crying, and yelling like a baby. It was intentional, on his part, in order to strike fear into the young gang members who idolized him. For Cagney's character, it was terribly humiliating and undignified.<br>  <br>  "There's maximum suspense in the slow walk toward death as Cagney puts on his most stoic, confident swagger—until the final, fateful moment where he turns into a shrieking, pathetic ball of jelly, refusing to face his death "like a man." This display of "cowardice" is unparalleled in gangster movies, and the more Cagney begs and screams, the more we're amazed at how he reduces the hero worship of gangsters to nothing."|`|tuULGJS6aa	One that the producers missed was the demise of the titular character in Ian Fleming's "Dr. No". In the book, 007 dumped tons of guano on him. Guano is bird crap, in case you don't know. Imagine being smothered under tons of that stuff. In the movie, he just sank into the water that had an atomic pile. I guess that the execution of Sir William Wallace (Mel Gibson) in "Braveheart" was the worst I've seen. He was hanged and then cut down and revived several times. Then, his belly was cut open, and his guts were pulled out. Finally, his head, arms and legs were cut off and put on poles around the city.|`|hQ95u9OLaa	In Hostel 2 when poor Heather Matarazzo gets sliced slowly to death by that woman who likes blood dripping on her.

4HuhGUIIaa	Hello Raj, <br>  <br>  Yes, I would say, sade sathi start is the primary cause of unrest. The second phase generally brings about unrest in career and family life, but overall its better than the first and the last sade sathi. <br>  <br>  Rahu Mahadasha is not the cause of your problems. Given the location of the rahu it would bring about health related issues, but currently you are less under the influence of the dasha and more under the influence of Shani (Saturn).<br>  <br>  Sade Sathi although lasts for 7.5 years, its impact for bad or worse is generally felt either first 1 year OR the last 1 year. The actually transit over of Saturn over the natal Moon brings a lot of luck. In you case case, it would bring in creativity amd good times in career and learning.  Saturn and lord of taurus (Venus) are friends, so the impact is less, but Sade Sathi has an impact on everyone, the degree of the impact will differ with the planetary placements.|`|DAmUAmPnaa	You should ask this question to PUNDIT he will tell you what to do to remove Sade sati & Rahu mahadasha.

CWz4M89Gaa	Freestyling in front of people without choking is not something that happens due to you lack of skill.  That is something that no one can help you over come. However coming off the top with quality rhymes takes practice and time but, you can accomplish this with simple methods. For example, Expand your vocabulary, you can write down 1 word and write down different synonyms that mean the same but sound different.  Try making a list of words on a piece of paper and make a rhyme for every word you write down. After that start adding more and more words.  Rhyming is the easy part.  Delivery and flow is probably the hardest part. First start rhyming without a beat. After you have that down, Start rhyming over beats, soon even when you have done for a while you should have your flow game down tight. So even when there is no beat, when you are spitting you still have a organized flow. PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE!!!|`|kLOsPkZNaa	It's not lack of skill. Practice makes perfect but at the same time if you are not confident about what you are spitting then of course you are going to choke. Keep practicing to your self and make sure you do it over beats and acapella. Over time you will get better and when you are rapping in front of people, just don't worry about what they think.|`|1lvyUwo7aa	That used to happen me, simply practice! Do freestlyes in front of just one or two people and keep increasing that number overtime. It is just a matter of time.|`|1qUokeKOaa	u gotta get comfortable aroun ppl spit around some of ur close friends then build up to crowds

plBXp91Daa	Virgo Man & Sagittarius Woman<br>  This relationship does not have a very good chance of lasting for long. The Virgo boy is a real introvert who doesn’t like a lot of fuss around him. Meanwhile you are a bundle of energy who feels that fun (what he calls "fuss") is the whole point of life! He is laid-back in the extreme and his reserved personality will seriously annoy you. He has a lack of courage when it comes to new situations and unfamiliar people. This is made worse when he’s with you, because you are bold and wild and fun-loving and that kind of intimidates him. You will end up looking down on his scaredy-cat, stay-at-home attitude. You’ll definitely be bored. Not a good match for you.<br>  <br>  Sadge girl may feel like class clown around button-down Virgo boy.  Virgo boy is all about getting assignments done on time, and meeting the sometimes impossibly high standards of his elders. You approach the world in very different ways, but both ways are valid.  Don't lose your spontaneity, Sadge. It's one of your best assets and it's the thing<br>  <br>   that drew Virgo boy to you in the first place

bribxhsdaa	T-Pain is his avatar. His Nickname is "Punkass". Avatars go above nicknames. Therefore, T-Pain is a "Punkass"...I hope the guy who couldn't spot that wasn't southern.<br>  <br>  1.You're not discussing Hip Hop. A discussion would be "Discuss the level of quality coming out of the south in relation to the success it's been recieving recently"<br>  <br>  2. People WILL take your anti-south crusade personally based on the fact that as of now, Southern Hip Hop and all the fads associated with it (irritating dances, Auto-tune etc) seem to be bigger than Jesus. <br>  <br>  3. You make yourself look bad by branding a region stupid with poorly constructed arguments:<br>  <br>  - Declaring an entire region stupid then specifying your wife (Of the same region) as the exception to the rule.<br>  <br>  - Begging the question in order to get people to confirm your already established views. "Is the reason the south makes dumb music because the people of the south are dumb" - I assume you know what "begging the question" means.<br>  <br>  4. You have obvious hang-ups about Southern Music/Southern Culture in general that are stopping you from viewing anything south-related objectively.<br>  <br>  FYI, I live in the UK, So I have no particular like/dislike towards the South.

7Sflq2doaa	I really liked it, though I think it would have been better if it two movies, like Karas, so they the could add more depth to the characters or explain the whole magic thing a little better, the quick explanations didn't rally sit well with me.

They think the ShamWow guy is strangely adorable. ;-)<br>  <br>  It has changed all of our conversations about boys. lololol<br>  <br>  They'll say: "I like this boy in my gym class."<br>  I'll say: "Oh yeah? Is he cute?"<br>  They'll say: "Well, he's cute in that ShamWow kinda way,  yknow?  Like you can't put your finger on it but you can't help but be attracted to him."<br>  <br>  ;-D|`|l3k21kTmaa	ok i bought sham-wow and its ok It didn't completely suck up all of the water like the commercial states but it works better then a paper towel and a dish cloth. Its ok, just don't expect it to be a magic cloth!

At a loss for something to say the father replied, "Buddy's legs are pointing straight up in the air so that it will be easier for Jesus to take him by the leg and lift him up to heaven."<br>  <br>  Little Johnny seemed to take Buddy's death quite well. However, two days later when his father came home from work, Little Johnny had tears in his eyes as he said, "Mommy almost died this morning." fearing something terrible had happened, his father questioned,<br>  <br>  "What do you mean Johnny? Tell Daddy!"<br>  "Well", mumbled Little Johnny, "Soon after you left for work this morning I saw Mommy lying on the floor with her legs in the air and she was shouting, 'Oh Jesus! I'm coming, I'm coming!' And, if it hadn't been for the neighbor who was holding her down, she would have gone to Heaven just like Buddy did."|`|wUooHVU3aa	Cops enter a home where a wife lays murdered on the bed, husband sits solemnly in a recliner downstairs.
