AXNkmdbKaa	If you are hearing the brakes squeal then you better replace them now.  It is a bracket designed to make a squealing sound when the brakes need replacement.  The next sound you hear will be a grinding which is the sound of the brake pad steel backing grinding grooves into your steel rotors.  Expensive.  If not too far gone then $100 should cover the brake job.  Let it go to long and it will take $800 or more.  It could need a v-belt if it has any.  They tend to squeal on cranking when they are loose due to wear.  Sometimes they can just be tightened.  If you have only serpentine belts then an ACCESSORY is doing the squealing, most like the alternator.  No way to tell anything about the oil until it gets worse.  Probably should let a mechanic look at it.|`|CFLqziutaa	Pappas07, I had similar problems last year and was glad I got my repairs covered under my extended warranty. extended warranties are cheaper if you buy them aftermarket. <a href="http://www.autoadviceonline.com/Warranty-Quote.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.autoadviceonline.com/Warranty...</a>

You need to know if the base components are still good.<br>  <br>  The option of having it rebuilt is a good one, and may or may not be that expensive.  The problem is to find out what needs repair.  You can take the motor to a rotary specialist and he can disassemble it quite quickly and let you know what's required.<br>  <br>  If the rotors and housings are within specs then it's just the many seals that would require replacement.

brxKFT1Laa	Ok, well congrats on doing so well with stick so far!<br>  C= its hard at first!<br>  <br>  mmm, <br>  Go check your transmission fluid, you might need to get it changed,<br>  im pretty sure its recommended to be changed every 40,000 -  50,000 miles...<br>  If theres not enough or needs to be changed its not properly lubricated...<br>  <br>  If your shifting early or late sometimes the gears wont like it and wont switch very easy as you might notice if your going 40mph and try to switch to 1st gear or if you were to try and switch to 4th at 15 mph.<br>  <br>  Mmm, reverse is always tricky becuase its the complete opposite transition. My car doesnt like to go into reverse easy either...<br>  The trick to getting into those hard gears like your 3rd or reverse if its not one of the things above is to very gently and slowly push the stick into that gear. Since your car doesnt have a Sport or Racing clutch its not able to throw those large gears back and fourth super fast. So even if you feel like you have to push as hard as you can as fast as you can, just take a breath and gently slide it up.<br>  <br>  3rd gear for me is almost like straight up, and it usually just flys into it no problem if i just push up.<br>  but i dont know how your gears are set, like i hvae a Camaro and the gears are not very far apart becuz its  a sports car. but if your gears are far apart then you just have to get used to where it is...<br>  Think about how far apart your shifting and youll kinda realize if your not pushing out far enough.<br>  <br>  Reverse is ten times easier to get into, like itll slide in like butter if your rolling backwards btw, so if your on a slight hill and it wont go in just let it roll a little, is the only other tip...but i dont think nething is broken!<br>  <br>  if all this doesnt hlep then maybe your clutch is going out and needs to be replaced...but hopefully not, cuz thats a big fix! if it, check around and find a good shop that is also affordable, make sure they tell you that if they install it wrong theres like a warranty or something for you to come back for free. Big names like pepboys is good! or a transmission shop good do it!<br>  <br>  Practice driving stick.. the more you drive the better you get, honest!<br>  When i started i thought i was amazing, then after like 6 months passed i realized i was not that good!<br>  So right now what might seem like a problem will eventually be something that you dont even realize!<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!

At 5'5" you may be able to handle a 250F, but it will be very tall on you. If you are still growing consider that also. Just go to a local shop and sit on any of the 250F models, it doesn't matter which since only a pro level rider can even distinguish the differences between the different makes. If the 250F is too tall the next fastest thing that is smaller will be the Honda CRF150R. Since you are asking this question I can only assume you don't have much experience riding motocross bikes in which case it is very important that you stick with a 4 stroke.

RcAofGkIaa	Listen hon, this is going to sound a little harsh, but try to take it from someone who wishes you no harm.  If you're going to drive, you're going to have to grow up.  A driving test isn't a charm school.  If your instructor was a jerk, he was.  It has nothing to do with the driving test.  Also, if he felt you were too close to the mirror, he did.  Don't whine about a technicality or try to weasel out of it.  You failed your driver's test....ratz!!!  But just get determined to try harder and practice more.  Honestly, no one can have too much practice behind the wheel.  You've got not only your life, but the lives of others in your hands.  When you think about that, a little more practice doesn't sound so bad does it?  Trust me, you'll look back on this and laugh.<br>  Awww kiddo, don't think I don't feel for you, I do.  I just don't like to see you focusing on the bad here.  Are there jerk driving instructors?  yup.  Are there nice driving instructors that make bad calls?  yup.

zhJOZhKEaa	When a child can *legally* ride without a booster varies from state to state.  Most of those state laws lag far behind when a child can *safely* ride without a booster.  (ETA: Most experts don't recommend a child be moved *into* a booster from a harnessed carseat until they are at least 40 pounds!)<br>  <br>  To ride safely without a booster the child needs to fit properly in an adult seatbelt.  A proper fit isn't determined by solely by a particular age, weight or height... but those are easier to use when writing laws.<br>  <br>  To fit properly a child needs to pass the '5 step test':<br>  <br>  1. Does the child sit all the way back against the auto seat? <br>  2. Do the child's knees bend comfortably at the edge of the auto seat? <br>  3. Does the belt cross the shoulder between the neck and arm? <br>  4. Is the lap belt as low as possible, touching the thighs? <br>  5. Can the child stay seated like this for the whole trip? <br>  <br>  Children *tend* to pass this test between 8-10 yrs of age and at about 4'9"... but again the *fit* is most important.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|23bgwpD1aa	when the child is 4'10 or 110lbs|`|hFLQras6aa	the child must be above 40 lb
Ip0wplAlaa	Wow, that is tough. I love both BMW and Audi because the engineering is incredible. You seem to know a thing or two about cars. Personally, I would chose the beamer because the a4 isn't a quattro. But I'm looking at it from a performance aspect. I also like the styling of the beamer better (on the outside). A factor you also need to look at is where you live. If you live in a place that you get snow you may consider the a4 for its AWD. Both of the car's interiors are amazing. One thing I like about the audi is the guage in the center that shows the car and gives you "updates" (can't think of a better word). For instance if a door is open it will light up the door and give you a message. It's just a cool feature. But, I would say that the 325i is more comfortable. You will also have less problems with the BMW in the long run (depending on how long you keep it). Both are expensive to fix though.... Anyway I know I typed a lot but I love both of these cars, I'm buying a BMW M3 coupe with the SMG transmission in the spring! So I have definitely done my research. So, in conclusion I would go with the beamer.|`|addaf7237cf3d32190cfc96546e98709aa	Audi.<br>  <br>  Newer, lower miles, safer, better ergonomics, much better fuel efficiency.<br>  <br>  Both cars have similar handling and acceleration and maintenance costs and reliability.<br>  But, they are both very expensive to maintain and fix and both require PREMIUM FUEL and expensive synthetic oils. And both are German cars so they get electrical problems.|`|9b36c8a9cd2a6e74b0258c1980397e49aa	Audi cuz it has less miles, is newer, and u get more gas mileage.|`|MQ6EEG2paa	The Audi is very different from the BMW. Even though I am an audi lover, I would recommend the BMW. Better gas milage, no hesitation while accelerating(turbo lag) and a reputation for better reliability. A test drive is also a must, however to really see how you like both the cars. Good Luck on your car search!|`|lcchJUuCaa	well the audi does have less miles on it but myself the 325i is better looking and has more style.<br>  <br>  but try and test drive each and see which one you like better|`|qMVOV9t4aa	Drive both and whatever one you like more buy it!|`|iBjQR2iBaa	bmw|`|f60f9dd363f9ce088c134896470f9277aa	I would go with the bimmer because the audi is turbo one more thing to go boom and not quattro which is awesome, even on dry roads the handling is incredible. My A6 is great but i think it would be less impressive without the superior handling that quattro provides. and since you are looking at small cars I will asume you are not planning to put the little people in the back therefore go more aggresive and sporty go 325i !|`|vWsElUtGaa	What are you looking for in the cars(performance, style, gadgets). They both have something to offer. The BMW is nice if you want a family car with a little more room and extra gadgets. The Audi would be best for performance, it has tons of mods for it. There style is about the same they both have the same standards for quilty inteiors.|`|JkfZ0IUjaa	i would personaly go for the audi, cuz its a better car, i find audi better to drive than BMW, and hence u spend alot of time in the car, the interior in the audi is better than the BMW, and plus audi is more reliable, also BMW owners tend to drive ther car hard whick does reduce the engine life, but audi's can take the punishment,|`|33lCc8mhaa	how about a nice economical prius? , seriously get the BMW, they are  awesome 2 drive apparently and almost indestructible.|`|Wb1Kwm99aa	The 325 for sure but ONLY because the Audi isn't a quattro..|`|EGKeYd0Waa	go with the audi it has wat less use on it.
AA12261615	try disconnecting the vacuum line that goes to the brake booster and then hit the brake pedal chances are it has a bad booster and its causing it to loose vacuum when you use the brakes on it,if it runs ok with the booster unhooked replace the booster on it,good luck.|`|82465d4152c317efc8046566296310d6aa	You are starting to have a problem with your power brake booster.

cglXxFWKaa	Go to Callahan auto for all your brake pad needs. Car parts made by the american people, for the american people, because thats who i am, and thats who i care about. (tommy boy) just kidding. seriously though try some EBC brake pads they have virtually no dust.|`|904d8796c3e4ff86e9122bd1dd6be562aa	The pads you are referring to are not dust free.  Ceramic pads still create a dust it is just tan or light colored instead of the black color.  Ceramic pads are available for most vehicles from manufacturers such as Raybestos and Wagner.  They are available to you from NAPA, Carquest, and many other retailers.|`|boYnYejVaa	those pads don't exist.  the mere nature of a braking system means there will be dust created as the pads rub the rotor.  now there are pads which dust LESS than usual and there are some that dust with a silverish dust so it seems to not make wheels so dirty but that's as good as it gets.  you can't beat physics.  i use Axxis/PBR Ultimate brake pads.  these are a ceramic/kevlar compound which means that they offer awesome braking performance compared to factory pads with much less dust.  look em up|`|to4eDfOHaa	Any ceramic brake pad can accomplish this. That's all I use for my car and it never gets brake dust. They're a little more expensive but well worth it if you have wheels.|`|wERMPd4Laa	They are called ceramic pads , you can get them at about any auto parts store.|`|0b974c44c4832c6adf69e44a2a906539aa	No one makes dust free pads, but you can buy themm the same color as your rims.|`|690f12091abe29ea8f867d38d36cb339aa	The real questions is whether you really want to use "dust free" pads. Brake pads wear to do their job, and the dust free ones are defeating this purpose. I tried these on my car and they sqeaked and grinded like crazy. I ended up shelling over $60 for the OEM pads that are much quieter and effectively stop my car. Besides, what purpose would it be to have good looking wheels if you manage to total your ride, or hurt someone.
to4eDfOHaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  I'm pretty sure that there is a cross-member under the oil pan. Well, last I worked on one.|`|AA10163923	I have never worked on a BMW but I would guess that the engine will have to be lifted. I have never seen one that did not have to be lifted to get the oil pan off.|`|d0e59c6de6a06b4ffe807dba128322d1aa	As the pan needs to drop straight down you can see what is what by looking at it.|`|8xREzHtEaa	Take a look underneath the car - is there anything in the way that would keep you from taking it off?<br>  <br>  If not, then no.<br>  <br>  If so, then you don't necessarily need to lift the engine, but you might need to disconnect some steering linkage or whatever is in the way.  You will want to make sure to have plenty of clearance so you can put the new gasket in, and replace the pan without having to jockey it around too much.  Use a thin layer of black RTV on the gasket to keep it in place.

It has been a good reliable car, and I have had few problems or repairs.  The body still has no rust!  <br>  <br>  ---HOWEVER---<br>  <br>  If I had to do it all over again, I would purchase a Toyota Camry/Corolla or Honda Civic/Accord.

How many miles per year?  That will let you know how many miles the car must have left in it.  Ideally you should get the lowest miles possible, but this would help you know your upper limit.  <br>  <br>  Your first car should be not very powerful, should handle well, and should be at least somewhat crashworthy, without being too much of a risk to others.  Since you're probably going to be a poor college student, it should be fuel efficient, but that usually goes with not powerful.<br>  <br>  Any of the bottom two (Camry/Corolla for example) models from the following makes:  Nissan, Honda, Toyota, Subaru (lower fuel economy, but with AWD), or Mazda (except the MX-6) should be okay.  Also the Mazda Miata (unless you're really tall, it's quite comfortable.  But you can't recline the seats).  Also the Suzuki Esteem.  (The wagon looks REALLY nice with tint.)<br>  <br>  Also just about any Ford/Lincoln/Mercury in the 2-5k range except the Probe and Contour/Mystique.  I find the Contour uncomfortable...too narrow in the shoulders.  But anyhow, it isn't about comfort, reliability on these is lower than most of Ford's range.  <br>  <br>  As for GM:  Olds Cutlass Ciera (later ones should be no more than a few thousand bucks), Chevy Caprice and Impala/Monte Carlo, Buick Regal. Forget anything else, except for rebadges of these cars.  The Camaro/Firebird are okay, but not as a first car.  Insurance will kill you if you don't kill yourself.  Same with the Mustang, BTW.<br>  <br>  Chrysler:  Dodge Neon after 1998.  That is all.  Nothing else in your price range is likely to be reliable.  <br>  <br>  There might be Saabs and Volvos in your price range.  Those and Subaru will be the safest cars you'll likely find.  <br>  <br>  For your first car, a pickup is not a great idea.  They are the worst handling vehicles on the road, with terrible weight balance, which varies more than any car (loads), they're prone to rolling, and they're generally the least crashworthy vehicles there are, as a class.  SUVs and subcompacts are safer than pickups.  If you don't need to regularly haul stuff, a pickup is probably not the right vehicle for you.<br>  <br>  If you need to haul cargo sometimes, get a wagon.  My mom has hauled sand, and lumber in hers.  <br>  <br>  Good rule of thumb for 80s and 90s cars, expect at least 200k miles out of the Japanese cars on this list, except Mitsubishi which would be a bit less.  150k out of the American ones.  Use that to figure out what you need to look for.  For 5 grand you should be able to find an economy car or a larger american car with well under 100k.<br>  <br>  If it were me and I didn't care about fuel economy, I'd try to find a Lincoln Mark VIII.  Can be had in good shape for 5 grand.  <br>  <br>  If I did care, I'd look for a Suzuki Esteem or Ford Escort wagon. <br>  <br>  If I were looking for the cheapest possible decent car, it'd be any of them with body damage, or the Olds Cutlass Ciera.  Those things are worth practically nothing, but they're one of GM's best cars of the 90s.|`|dcb8aa9b18e4d753414010e9974c3451aa	Toyota Corolla|`|dd6ad429c24b00b8c74ad6b0dba74383aa	I want a lamborgini convertible 4 my 16th birthday!|`|45d524bcbb0d40efd17987fa424b3ddaaa	I would go with a Honda Accord.

OK the first thing to know is that the filling stations tanker under ground is not 100% dirt free so when you fill gas you will get some dirt with it, and over time of filling up the dirt deposit in your tank will increase, so now that you have a good amount of dirt in it and you run out.... this in turn has sucked up this dirt and possibly blocked your fuel line or the pump or the fuel filter or the fuel rail or the injectors if its a carborator the fuel jets .. needle and seat. so check if your getting fuel in to the cylinder to ignite or combust in the cylinder chambers. 2) to check the spark your self.. one at a time UNplug and un screw a spark plug.. now put the plug on the H.T Leeds OK know hold the Leeds and not the spark plug +- 5 to 10mm from inner car body and have a Buddie crank her up you must see a spark as it makes contact with the earth of the body, do this with all of the cylinders Plugs. if its not this then i will need more info... thanks for this question..|`|lKlPuzxgaa	k|`|nL9OOFh4aa	Try doing a tune up.

Since it may not be the fuel injectors (I agree with the above post) they will need to spend some time with the vehicle to find out the problem...and that will cost money. <br>  <br>  But still, I would recommend doing that. Get it out of the way before you have anymore problems that may ruin your trip.

The Explorer is Worth between 2500 and 3500 dollars depending upon the shape it is in and that price is with a good transmission. If you have the ability to put the transmission in yourself you can probably do it for appx 500 to 750 dollars if you get the tranny from a junk yard. If you get a new tranny and have someone put it in you will be looking at about 2000 dollars. Personally i would give him 1500 for the explorer at the most and then have someone put a new transmission  in it for you.

cafe7c84a66c8fdcb3e5f71ee1222ee2aa	I am guessing that you have a drain pan, oil and filters already. You may have to raise both vehicles to get under them Block them up before crawling under them. Find and remove the drain plugs, and drain the oil into the drain pan. replace the drain plug. Now remove the oil filter, you will need the drain pan because the filters have oil in them, Make sure that the surface that the oil filter mates with is clean.Put a small amount of oil on the rubber gasket and install the new filter, once it becomes snug only turn it 1/2''. Fill with new oil, check for leaks and make sure that the level is full. DO NOT OVER FILL.|`|Vlz6HrEEaa	two ways: 1) go to a mechanic and pay him to do it, or 2) jack the front end of the car up, or drive it up onto ramps.  Underneath the front end of the car, find the drain plug on the oil pan, and remove it (you will need a box wrench).  Let the old oil drain into a pan or other suitable container (you can get one at Auto Zone or someplace similar).  Replace the plug, then pour the appropriate amount of oil (check your user manual) into the engine.  It really is easy, if you have the means and time to do it.|`|mPPzC0Ooaa	If you have to ask, You should take it to you local service station and have them do it!

d92UzA2oaa	You can file a first party bad faith lawsuit against your insurance company, and you can sue the person you were involved in the car accident in. If you did choose to do this, most likely it would be best to get the assistance of an attorney. There's no guarantee you would prevail, but those are your options.|`|75b701681e36bd3d8587f81aedde23aeaa	whoa whoa whoa.. slow down here.. theres alot going on here...<br>  <br>  First off... Why did your insurance take so long? Are you saying that you called them day one... didnt start repairs or anything until they looked at it.. and then they just took a month? If thats the case.. yes.. this was wrong....<br>  <br>  Now... im thinking thats not the case.. im thinking you probably wanted to go through the other guys insurance or something at first so they couldnt help you.. or you got repairs before you were authorized (you know you cant do that right? you have to wait until they see it and do an estimate!).. any of these reasons then they had every right not to do anything... because they couldnt! you didnt give them the opportunity too!<br>  <br>  <br>  Now.. the other company doesnt have to accept liability, they have a right to do an investigation and decide accordingly...here is what happens in that case... your insurance pays for your repairs... and then they have a third party come in and here both companies arguments.. and then they pick the final liability.  <br>  <br>  To answer your question shortly.. Yes.. sure you can do a bad faith claim against your insurance.. but honestly.. i really doubt they did anything wrong.<br>  <br>  As far as the other insurance.. theyve made their decision. You need to go through your insurance and let them fight it out.. you cant just "sue" the insurance company... well again.. you technically can.. but good luck with that. Thats what you pay your insurance for.<br>  <br>  Ignorance on your part doesnt mean they did something wrong. Open your eyes for a second and take into consideration that there is a possibility that you are part of the problem.|`|Kw6YxSgoaa	Double check the police report and speak with the supervisor of the adjuster of the OTHER insurance company. Find out if the other person was cited. Ask them why they believe you are 70% Negligent. You can take it to arbitration if you would like. Depending on what state you are in, you could sue the guy that you hit, but I would recommend fighting with the insurance company also. Keep track of every penny that you are spending as part of fighting it. Also, where did you have the repairs done at. If it is a shop that is approved by your insurance, they should pay for the repairs only. (not the rental car that you had during that time) $400.00/day seems excessive for a rental car. Make sure that the rental car company knows that you are having your vehicle repaired through your insurance company. Most insurance companies will only allow 25-30/ day. If you are still unhappy with the decision, then you could sue him directly. If you win, either he, or his insurance company would have to pay up. Good luck|`|7f25735f7922b8509122cca3769e7a64aa	Well yes and no,  <br>  <br>  you did the right thing by reporting it to your insurance were you hurt and did you have to see a doctor?  because if so you have the right to consult with a personal injury attorney. (I work for one) if its just damage that was done to your vehicle then you are better off sueing this person in Small Claims court where I belive you can name both parties the person and the insurance company. Just go to your local county website and browse through their website and find small claims in california you can claim up to 7,500  in damages with out paying an attorney becuase in small claims  there are no lawyers allowed<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|ulGxKf0kaa	If your insurance company paid any damage at all, then they will have to subrogate. (to read more on that go to <a href="http://www.auto-insurance-claim-advice.com/Subrogation-of-Rights.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.auto-insurance-claim-advice.c...</a> ) This means that you auto insurance will have to take them to an arbitration panel to decide who was at fault for the accident. <br>  <br>  If you have a police report citing the other driver for an impropert left, then he probably has more fault than you do. Ask your insurance to subrogate for your damages. This will end up in arbitration. <br>  <br>  If your case goes to arbitration (free to you), then you can ask your insurance to add the bill of your rental car. If they win in arbitration, then they would have pay you back. <br>  <br>  Hope it helps,

Are you planning to use the electric motors primarily or as a helper to the gas engine (like hybrids already in production)? <br>  <br>  Basically, you will need:<br>  <br>  solar panels<br>  a large capacity battery<br>  some form of electric motor<br>  some form of transmission <br>  some form of speed control<br>  <br>  <br>  A good place to start research would be in R/C Cars. Not the dinky ones from Wal-Mart... the competition ones! They aren't solar, but they will give you the foundation of knowledge you are looking for. The basic components of the drivetrain on an R/C are:<br>  <br>  electric motor<br>  speed control<br>  battery<br>  gears<br>  <br>  the speed control will regulate the number of amps sent to the electric motor, which will in turn regulate the number of RPM's it turns. <br>  <br>  The motor itself can determine alot about the performance of the car. The windings around the armature make the difference. They determine how much torque the motor will make, how many RPM's it will turn, and even how smooth the acceleration will be.<br>  <br>  The battery is a major issue. There are many factors involved including voltage, capacity, amperage, ability to cope with constant charging / discharging, and physical size.<br>  <br>  All in all, I say it would be more cost effective to just go out and buy a hybrid. The Honda Insight uses the simplest method, where the Toyota Prius offers one of the best efficiency ratings. If you are dead set on building the car, be prepared to spend alot of cash, and alot of time researching and building.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  [EDIT] For future reference:<br>  <br>  A "car motor" is actually refered to as an engine. A motor is powered by electricity or other means than combustion. An engine is powered by combustion. From the American Heritage Dictionary, the definition of an engine: "Such a machine distinguished from an electric, spring-driven, or hydraulic motor by its use of a fuel."

qbL19IHDaa	if the smoke is a white smoke then you are pretty much screwed.  You may have blown the head gaskets.  Check the tailpipe and see if there is any liquid or severe condensation, if there is then soak it up and smell it.  Sweet smelling then it is antifreeze and the car is done for.  You wont see a leak under the engine because all the liquid is coming out the tailpipe and becoming vapor.  <br>  <br>  Also take a good look at the hoses. If they were driving that fast and hit something it could have split the hose and you would have lost all your fluid like that.  <br>  <br>  Next smack the crap out of your friend for driving 110 on a dirt road.  <br>  <br>  check the fan, check for any wiring that might be loose.

Then wax it two times it will bring back all the luster. BMW has good paint so it should come back fine. You should be able to find Compound at any aotu parts store like Auto-zone. Good Luck.|`|6f41049912ed1c51a7e9c4bf734c341baa	When you say 'the shop', do you mean the body shop, or the detail shop?  Unless you plan on buffing it on a regular basis, I'd recommend taking it to a detail shop and having it buffed out by a professional rather then buy the two different compounds and buffer.  Then, buy some good wax and wax the hood, roof, and trunk like every other week or so.  If it's in the red family, it should bounce back fairly well.  If it's in the light blue/silver spectrum, you'll have a harder time with it.  Unless the paint is actually gone, you shouldn't have to take it to the body shop.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

(ie: what are you willing to spend? Buy quality once or buy crap a thousand times?)<br>  <br>  I would recommend 12" subs as a lot of low end 15's sound sloppy and 10's don't punch. 12's definitely give the best overall sound, response, and range if you are on a budget.<br>  <br>  Infinity makes an amazing subwoofer, as does MTX. Sony's Xplod line used to be good, however I haven't checked them out in a while so I'm not sure what they are up to. However, subs must be suited to a specific taste and then paired with a box that will enhance all of those qualities. If you are looking to create a boom that will make the young smile and the elderly weep, then you are probably looking for a bandpass box. If you are looking for balance in your music consider a High Output box, possibly with the subs offset 90 degrees to each other.<br>  <br>  A great resource, and a place that is always having deals, is: www.crutchfield.com<br>  <br>  They let you match your car make, model, and year so it's pretty helpful.

The only real way to find out if it's the gasket or the head is to remove and inspect. If the gasket shows traces of water leakage or it's really worn in certain areas then chances are good this is the problem.<br>   <br>  The other things to observe are:<br>  If it starts good initially and runs like a champ until it reaches normal operating temperature then starts to run like crap then chances are good you have a cracked head. A bad head will open up mainly when the engine heats up. <br>  <br>  A bad head gasket most commonly does it through out the duration of the car being on. <br>  <br>  Although this is not always the case, like I said, the only real way is to remove and inspect and if it's not noticeable, send the head to a shop to have it tested.<br>  <br>  Good luck

Los números del Renault son superiores en todos los rubros. Ahora que para información de todos el Mini no es BMW y BIB tiene razón, muchos traen motor Chrysler.<br>  Conozco muchos usuarios de ambos autos y hay bastantes arrepentidos de haber comprado Mini y sin embargo no conozco uno solo que se arrepienta de haber comprado Clio Sport. Al final la desicion la tienes tu pero antes de comprar habla con propietarios de ambas marcas, esa es la mejor referencia, si puedes manejalos antes.<br>  Ahora que si quieres un auto para que te volteen a ver como dicen por ahi, comprate un Porsche!!<br>  <br>  BIB, el manejo de un Mini y un Kart no se parecen en nada, ahora si di, exagere!!<br>  <br>  Saludos<br>  Pro 4 Racing Cars - Mexico|`|M8E2Bza9aa	no lo dudes pero ni por un instante mini cooper|`|UqfvvUpcaa	El mini ja unos dicen que ese coche es gay pero es por envidia ademas no les hagas caso es tu descision|`|fbd281888cb1a2f664006f5a3c2e186caa	Yo te recomiendo mas el MINI COOPER...<br>  <br>  El Cooper es un compacto premium por pertenecer a la BMW y el Clio Sport es un compacto deportivo pero NO PREMIUM, por lo que el Clio Sport se queda corto en cuestion de imagen, pues quien maneje uno puede pasar desapercibido y un Mini Cooper por ser un vehiculo poco comun y con una imagen muy llamativa porque tiene mucho carisma no pasara desapercibido, te voltean a ver porque te voltean a ver.<br>  <br>  Pero si tu objetivo es para correr, te recomiendo el Clio Renault Sport, el unico detalle que tendras que tomar en cuenta es que las refacciones de este auto son caritas debido a que este vehiculo es de origen frances.

Ask to see the rebate in your contract before you sign the papers.|`|b4ee911bd65fdf2cdb04f66446b5b31daa	Manufacturers offer rebates or special interest rates.  It's one or the other.   Sometimes the financial institute,(Ford Credit, Chrysler Financial) will offer incentives to finance through them.  Also, sometimes there are extra incentives,(military discount, Farm Bureau member)  that you would have to visit a dealership to find out what you qualified to get.|`|AA11618684	Depends on the incentive program, but typically manufacturer incentives will be an either/or proposition, so you either take the rebate or the low interest rate loan, not both.  <br>  <br>  To see which offer is better in the long run, you'd need to calculate how much money you'd save on the loan using the special interest rate vs. the regular rate you'd qualify for, and compare it to the rebate.  Here's a very simple amortization calculator that you can use to play around with different interest rates and lengths of loan: <a href="http://www.amortization-calc.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.amortization-calc.com/</a> (it's very eye opening to see how the interest paid can explode as the rate & length go up).<br>  <br>  In general, if you have good credit, the rebate will make more sense since you should be able to get a fairly good rate without the incentive.  But if you have bad credit, a low interest loan will save you a bundle in the long run.

Ebay is the worst place to buy cheap cars as you don't have a chance to inspect them-and then you could easily have more in repair costs than you paid for the car...and you still have to to pick it up and drive it home. Stay away from Ebay in this case. Personally, I'd wait and save another thousand or 1500 before I bought a car.<br>  If all you have is a thousand, check the local papers and have it checked out thoroughly before you buy by a good local mechanic. Should cost between 50 and 100 bucks. Even then, it can be a crapshoot. There are very few $1000 cars that don't need some kind of repair and I guarantee it'll be in the shop before long.

t1pd0Yxmaa	There are two reasons for squeeky brakes. The first is they are too low and need to be replaced and the squeek you hear is a small piece of metal called a wear indicator touching you rotor to let you know they are low. The second is the pad are not seating against the rotors flush and you must seat them (you should also do this if you just got new pads). The best place to do this is on a deserted street. Drive for a few minutes not using brakes at all-come to a QUICK HARD stop. What you are doing is heating the pad and forcing to form to the rotor. Turn around and drive a few minutes again with no brakes and repeat-do this 5-10 times and it should stop the squeek. Remember to vote for a best answer|`|oBNc9arMaa	If the brake pads are still good just take some light sandpaper and scuff up the rotors also wash the pads off with brake cleaner. If the little wear indicator (squeal tab) flat metal tab is hitting the rotor replace your brakes.

kaCTvyxxaa	I own a 2001 VW Beetle. I actually just got it back from the repair shop today after I paid $1,030 to get the clutch repaired. In the past year, I've had to replace the clutch, the fly wheel, both driver and passenger side window regulators, the alternator, 2 batteries, the driver seat belt (it always gets jammed behind the seat), brake lights (there's a recall on the lights and mine went out completely and then stayed on forever), the brake pads, spark plugs, and the mass air flow sensor. All of the vw decals on the tires have fallen off. The front bumper has fallen down, because the car is so low to the ground it's easy to hit things. The cup holders suck. Replacement keys are $300 plus the cost to program them. Three weeks ago, I was driving down the freeway and the rear driver side tire blew out and cause severe damage to the back of the car totaling $3,500. I understand that some of these things are just regular maintenance and my car is 7 years old, but for me all of the problems hit at once. Parts are ridiculously expensive because they are German even the after market parts. Never buy parts from the dealer!! <br>  <br>  Really the only thing I like about the beetle is that it's cute, it has ok gas mileage, the oil easy to change, and there's a cute flower holder.|`|0iqu77z0aa	OK I own a 1971 superbeetle. we've put lotsa money in to it. but it is worth owning. most either have stripped parts or problems but tons of them are in mint condition or rebuilt.

FSd1d2Wvaa	I had a 97 neon and probs with the A/C system.  It would occasionally get bogged down when tryin to accelerate, and in slow moving traffic or at a stop, the vehicle would stall, and not start for a few minutes.

c48nm70gaa	I would ask a private mechanic if he would install an oil pressure gage temporally inside your car. From my 45 years of experience you should only actually hear the noise you describe when you completely change the engine oil and can't conveniently fill the new oil filter with engine oil. Another reason may be the oil filter that they are using does not have a built in anti-drainback valve.

5ulYTKyraa	Reasons why I drive a manual:<br>  0) Manuals have a clutch too, not just a shifter.  As stated above, you are controlling an additional parameter, like having a wah pedal on a guitar.  Sure, you can use auto-wah, but it's not as expressive as controlling it yourself.<br>  1) Manuals kick ***!  How can I kick *** with an automatic?  It's pretty hard to.<br>  2) Manuals make you feel more connected to the car.  It's like being "jacked in" to the Matrix.<br>  3) Manuals get better gas mileage, based on the numerous factory stickers/stats I saw when I looked for & bought my current car.  Yes, I know the stickers/stats aren't perfect, but 5 mpg across the board does make some difference.<br>  4) Regardless of how many variables a computer-controlled "modern" automatic like a BMW can control, there's still the "it" factor that humans have.  Otherwise, why would race cars have manuals (for the ones that have more than 1 forward gear)?  Because humans can make a judgement based on instinct, which computers can't do because they don't have instincts.  You can't program an instinct, because it can be any combination of signals. There will always be humans that are "gifted when shifted", and that can make the right decision to shift/press the clutch just a little/etc. when a computer would not.|`|mIpL9ZKEaa	Not any more likely. After awhile you learn how to shift and when to shift without even thinking about it. <br>  The vast majority of the trucks on the roads today are stick shift and they are driven by the professionals. <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|mcJKCEx4aa	AUTOMATIC. . . <br>  because Automatic is easier than Manual|`|PxJXJKCpaa	I've never crashed a car, but having a manual makes you pay a bit more attention to the vehicle.  I've had both.  My truck is a stick.  I can drive one handed while carrying a puppy and smoking.  But then, I've been doing that for years.<br>  <br>  My husband's truck is automatic and I still look for the clutch and stick when I drive his. lol|`|73eb4728618b7c8e1b3a898b23e2f443aa	manual is safer because to have a greater controll over your own acceleration and deceleration.  And in order to drive manual you are forced to pay close attention to traffic to judge your gear shifts correctly.  With auto you just point and click no concentration neccisary.
SOfbIOzUaa	You're only 16. Then you still have a couple years of high school left? Yet you must be working cause you have money for lease payments.<br>  <br>  If you buy a used car for $3,000 or $4,000 will that be with your own money? or is mom & dad going to buy it for you?<br>  <br>  Do you really need your own car? If you have money already saved and have been working and going to school without your own car up until now, why do you need your own car now?  Why not continue saving your money and get your own car later? what I am saying is to consider doing neither, don't lease and don't buy. Wait another year or year and a half when you'll have even more money saved up.<br>  <br>  At the end of the lease will you have money saved up for your next car or will paying the lease take most of what you make? Will you be better off or worse off at the end of the lease? Also remember if you lease you will be limited as to how many miles a year you put on the vehicle.<br>  <br>  If you buy, I would suggest a good used car, like a Honda possibly even with high mileage but well kept and serviced. You shouldn't be in any hurry so keep your eyes open for the right deal.  I bought a used Honda 4 years ago for only $2400 and I have a buyer for it now for $1000.  So in 4 years it cost me $1400. What will you pay over 2 years for the lease?  <br>  <br>  Also, new drivers often are involved in accidents. And the insurance is going to cost a lot more on a new leased vehicle than on a used car that is depreciated regardless of who is paying for the insurance. Have you discussed this with your parents since you say that they will pay for the insurance?|`|EMh3cD7Maa	Leasing is a good way to get more car for a lower monthly payment... If you drive less than the allowed mileage and like to change cars every three to 4 years and don't mind never actually owning a car, too.<br>  <br>  You are at 16, not qualified for a lease. Credit restrictions are more strict than a purchase, and as the principle driver it wont fly!  |`|3MTYGEbWaa	Leasing might be fine for you as it is for a lot of people, including myself, but you need to understand how it works and if you are right for lease before doing it. There's more to it than lower monthly payments. Here's an article that might help:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.firstcarguide.com/lease/basics-of-car-leasing.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.firstcarguide.com/lease/basic...</a><br>  <br>  .|`|328e52056e90a15c3247940d35d04602aa	Well, it would make financial sense to save up and buy a cheap used car. Most of the time, you can sell it later and recoup most of the money. I once purchased a '88 Accord for $900 and a year and 25k miles later, sold it for $700. So it only cost me $200 for a whole year of use!<br>  <br>  Leasing makes sense if you like to trade-in after a few years and don't drive over 12,000 miles a year. Also some banks require a higher insurance coverage due to the risk and also GAP insurance is very very important in leases.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|mGYaT87baa	Very tough question. It can be a good deal, but the devil is in the details. Getting a good lease is harder than getting a good deal on buying a car, as there are many ways you can get blind sided if you don't completely read and understand all the terms of the lease. How many miles do you get? (it's never unlimited). What are the overage fees? At best, it is renting, not owning, and you are stuck with the car for the term, no matter what. 90% of the time, it's better to buy. But I can't be sure without seeing all the details. I you're a young driver, a decent used car is almost allways the best choice. If it's cheap enough, you can avoid collision insurance and save a bundle. At some point, you're going to have to pay for the car yourself, including the insurance, and you might realize it isn't worth driving a brand new car with your own money.<br>  |`|quUiaHeSaa	Some people think so but in my personal opinion only.  I don't like that idea because if you happen to have a life changing event like a health issue that may keep you out of work or death that you have to pay for if the person or persons didn't have insurance, even yet if you or family member losses their job at the time your lease is up you will have some problems because they will expect you to lease another car or give that car back.  Plus you will never be the owner of that car. <br>  <br>  That happened to a few people that I know and it did not go down well at all. <br>  <br>  There are up's to having a lease also.  I myself don't like taking certain risks especially how the economy is going right now.<br>  <br>   |`|bJFJ1l6daa	Well I wouldnt buy an old car because then it will have a bunch of problems and the cost will be expensive to fix it.<br>  <br>  I say go for the lease!<br>  as long as you are only using it for 24 months.<br>  other then that it isnt worth it if your using it longer.<br>  are you only using it to get around or are you  making Bigg road trips?<br>  If  you are then get a new one.|`|183aXCPyaa	I would never do it.  It's like renting.  You have in short-term, indefinitely but it is never yours.  It's much better to take a loan out on a car.  That way whenever you're making a payment it's at least going towards something that's yours that you can resell should you ever change your mind.|`|AA10268382	car leases are called the fleecing of america. It's never smart although allot of people can talk them selves into leasing.

At the end of the contract you own something? or just more poor with no house or a car?|`|AA12089308	Sometimes.  <br>  You'll be saving allot of money by leasing a car, however there is a list of things you cannot do with your car when you lease it.  Even with insurance, I believe that you must pay for any of the slightest damage on your car.. So in all it's much different than buying a car all at once.  I have bought all of my cars, so I don't know the whole scoop besides what I heard when I was thinking about a lease.  Try asking your car dealer about the benifits of it, because knowing them, they won't tell you anything that's wrong with it.  <br>  Good Luck.|`|AVpu9K71aa	It is smart if you are the type of person that always wants a new car.  Leasing would enable you to use a car without sacrificing as much depreciation as you would by buying a new car.  The downside of leasing is that you don't have a car that you could sell at the end of the lease and you have to pay for all the damages done to the vehicle at the end of the lease.  If you don't mind having an older (3-4yrs old) then leasing is probably not the route you want to go.  <br>  <br>  Some things to keep in mind:<br>  <br>  -Most cars lost the majority of the depreciation within the first two years.<br>  -Most redesigned(ie, the new lancer, the new camaro, etc) cars have engineering bugs within the first 2-3 years of their production.
qpP0ypVzaa	First check the fuse.  If everything appears to be working it's probably burnt out.  Those heating elements go after a handful of years depends on the frequency.  If you miss them, take it in.  Usually they're hidden in the upholstery of the seat and hard to get at.  I ruined a seat a long time ago trying to do it myself.

Yes, they will fit but they're the wrong off-set.<br>  <br>  They will probably rub against the wheel arch but even if they don't rub, they'll throw your suspension geometry way out of line.<br>  <br>  Don't do it,<br>  <br>  Andy|`|xnT5bzmuaa	I would suggest that you call the dealership on this kind of question.

Call the dealership!|`|HZ9qmD6oaa	I've tried the exact same thing, and they do fit and turning is ok unless you crank the wheel all the way then there is some rubbing which sucks. I never ended up using them because they will throw off your alignment and possibly do more damage then that. Unless you have no choice I would say don't.

Make sure you sand off all the paint where you ground.|`|vlBA4hfpaa	do not get a ground loop isolater you will lose up to 3db of gain you will need to identfiy what kind of noise it is clicking whinning i found noise can come from cheap rca's, power wire and rca's running together , screwing your amp to metal/should be on a peice of wood/, bad  gounds are  like on the trunk lids or a seat bolt or on a tail light. gound wire should no be no longer than 18"s and scrap the paint off to bare metal and  using a star washer & selftapin screw put as close to frame as possible if noise is still there check radio amp out  sometime there can be a cold sodier  inside the units so let me know|`|nuv7Oys7aa	those 2 answers above are correct but you also need to consider where your power cable is relative to your red/white cable is. if they are ran through the car in the same place this could cause the noise.  the ground for the amp is not the only ground that cause this, most cars are grounded in many places (the engine) and if one is loose or has poor connection you will get this noise
IOvUnrfIaa	when the battery is that dead, you have to wauit a while for jumpstarting after connecting the cables.<br>  <br>  The very small contact area of the cable clamps is not big enough to handle your starters amperage by themselves, so your dead battery must be charged somewhat to help the cables.<br>  <br>  But when car batterys are dead dead like yours (windows dont need much power) it will take a half hour of the other car idling, connected to your battery to get it going again.<br>  <br>  SO, try again, Connect, then wait a half hour before cranking your engine!|`|4u8XHkxuaa	if the battery is completely dead then it will take awhile to charge it back up. hook up the jumper cables and let the running car idle for awhile then try starting your car.

TsMCMn5Taa	although possible, i do not suggest wiring each voice coil to a channel. with doing that each voice coil is not receiving the same signal and could pose a problem in the future.

dff914b94660907c765a86ed107dbe45aa	This sounds bad, but it's ALL ABOUT THE FACTORY.<br>  <br>  The new GTIs are being made in Germany (along with the Rabbits) when for about 12 years or so, they were made in Mexico & Brazil. Nothing against those countries or factories at all (please also see my notes at the bottom), but I've just had bad luck with VWs from these plants). All that being said though, this makes me highly confident that the new German-assembled GTI's will be good cars (and if I had the money, you could bet I'd be buying one!)<br>  <br>  *Stay away from any VW made in Mexico or Brazil from 1993-2005 though (the Mk3 chassis & Mk4 chassis) - some are just fine, but I've had horrible luck!<br>  <br>  *On the other hand, older Mk2 chassis (1985-1992) Golfs, GTIs, Jettas, and Jetta GLIs that are Wolfsburg edition cars (VIN # starts with "WVW" and has tags on front fenders behind the wheelwells) are AWESOME - really reliable, really cool, and still really good on gas.|`|addaf7237cf3d32190cfc96546e98709aa	There are no reliability ratings for the 2006-2008 GTI because they are still new cars.<br>  <br>  The older GTI's had very reliable engines, but they had electrical problems like power windows getting stuck. nissan has the same problems with the 350z.<br>  <br>  But the 06-08 is still new so the cars should not show any problems at an early age.<br>  <br>  200HP Turbochaged 2.0L engine.<br>  0-60mph in 6.5 seconds.<br>  Top Speed estimated of 142mph-146mph.<br>  <br>  It is comfortable and fun to drive and great on gas.

Volkswagen has the highest resale value of any car, which is nice considering i own one. I have a 2007 GTi and absolutely love it. Sometimes it scares me how fast it is. It is so secure on the road, absolutely nothing gets in its way. I am always driving on large interstate, and while other cars are hydroplaning, or getting blown by the wind, i just cruise on through. <br>  <br>  Although it is such a nice performing car, the seats are incredibly comfortable. As for the sound system, here is what i have to say. It is incredibly clear, and crisp. It has good volume and sound. Its not that the speakers arent good, its just that they dont have tons of base for hip hop songs. They are a very good quality speaker though. <br>  <br>  As for milage, i get about 24 city, 28 around town, 35 highway. <br>  <br>  I love it, and will own volkswagens from here on out.|`|73eb4728618b7c8e1b3a898b23e2f443aa	vw's are not reliable they have constant issues .  Check the web for customer reviews and you'll see.  Also look in classified ads most vw's are selling for way below book value for newer cars.  If you want something reliable that gets good gas mileage that will also have some resale value when you're done with it, get a jap car get toyota Honda or nissan. <br>  Good luck|`|HkS0jWIUaa	volkswagen is very reliable and they probably get about 22 city and 29 highway mpgs.|`|YoSVwyglaa	For the record you will hear road noise.

zXty31a8aa	I've always understood that to get good mpg the following applies to air con;<br>  If it's hot, roll a window down.<br>  If it's very hot, roll both windows down.<br>  If your steering wheel's melting put your air con on.|`|jlXPsVfdaa	It depends on the speed you are going. If you are going over 40 miles an hour, the air resistance caused by having your windows down causes you to get less miles per gallon. Under 40 miles an hour, it makes sense to roll your windows down.|`|U24VtSlZaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  the air conditioner has a belt-driven "compressor".  It requires energy to turn the pully with the belt that drives the compressor.  It puts a bigger load on the engine.  The engine makes fewer RPMs at the same throttle setting, so you have to "give it more gas".|`|73eb4728618b7c8e1b3a898b23e2f443aa	yes the a/c puts more stress on the engine causing it to use more gas however most modern cars get better gas mileage with the a/c on than with the drag they experience with the windows down. so its better to drive with a./c than windows down but a/c uses more gas than no a/c with windows up. I hope that helps.|`|4b219236b3b52d63196d3dbe0f6a4d21aa	Yes, when the AC is engaged it puts more strain on the belt/pulley system which adds more strain to the motor.  More strain to the motor requires the motor to run harder, therefore using more fuel.  Newer vehicles are more efficient but you still use more fuel with the AC, though it may be a smaller amount than an older vehicle.|`|gg5Hp2mQaa	Sometimes! According to Wikihow (see link below for more ways to save)<br>  Use A/C only on the highway. At lower speeds, open the windows. This increased the drag and reduces fuel efficiency, but not as much as the AC at low speeds (35-40 mph). <br>  Happy motoring :>)|`|dXW3xD0gaa	For best MPG:<br>  <br>  HWY speed - AC on and window up.<br>  STREET speed - AC off and window down.<br>  <br>  The BEST - AC OFF and window UP.<br>  <br>  I was out today and was just going for a short drive. The above was kind of moot because it was so hot I could not drive with the AC off (which I normally prefer - regardless of cost).<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck...|`|uiw53OT8aa	Using air conditioning does decrease your fuel mileage slightly. Depending on the type of vehicle you drive, this decrease may only be 1 or 2 mpg.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if you were really in danger of running out of gas, your car would have given you an indication. Some cars will give a warning light, others will alert you that you have a certain amount of miles left before you are out of luck. So, unless this was the case, turning the A/C off was unnecessary.<br>  <br>  But, the answer to your question is yes. Use of air conditioning, just like having the windows down, decreases fuel mileage.|`|dtbGeKW7aa	Turning the A/C on does put a load on the engine, therefore using more gasoline. The A/C is belt driven off of the engine. Just depends on the engine how much it loads the engine. 4 cylinders will use more gas, V8's have more horsepower that the A/C will not load it very much.|`|2zbNiSQ5aa	On average, it will reduce your milage by 1 mpg. When you drive with the windows down instead, the wind resistance on your car also decreases the milage by 1 mpg.|`|PLG63hZ3aa	Yes. The engine has to work harder. But do not go with out ac. I did that for a year, because my boyfriend told me that, and i almost died in the summer, especially in southern California.|`|tWkuepePaa	with modern ac's using less energy, the answer I've been hearing and reading is no, and this is just today in the Asbury Park Press.|`|kZUIkpIsaa	No, not compared to the windows rolled down and the wind resistance holding back the car.|`|xocOB40Eaa	oh yeah. it most certainly does. probably 10 - 15 percent would be my estimation
73eb4728618b7c8e1b3a898b23e2f443aa	if the sound is heard when the transmission is engaging (like when you just put it in D) and it drives fine with no sounds its probably just a worn bushing or stabilizer. if it clicks and clunk while moving in drive than it may b cv axles.|`|9fHgwluSaa	It may be broken transmission mount or broken motor mounts.

1dfaef4eac347071e4f72e9b562c343caa	No way. It's long and will take a few hours but run the wires straight from the battery and because its a powerful amp, you will probably need a heavy duty capacitor with that so that when theres a big thump your amp doesn't suddenly run out of power. Again with the high powered amps, they need new alternators with higher outputs as the stock alternators can find it hard to cope with high power amps, But you never know it might still work. Chances are it will work but it will shorten the life of the alternator.|`|42ed0b617069464e77343114e09c7994aa	No if you want a amp in your car it's always the best idea to use thick power cables and the ones in the lighter will to be able to handle your amp... what size amp are we talking about?<br>  <br>  Edit: Yeah your lighter socked will never run it. you will blow your fuse the first time you switch it on...

4XQzATWbaa	Micras are top first cars to own and they are great runners - I bought an H reg for ￡900 several years ago with 34,000 genuine miles on the clock.  Even the Nissan garage told me that the older models are the best ones.<br>  <br>  Yes, it's high mileage but check service history, are the breaks spongey?  There are bound to be a few leaks but as long as these are major, no worries.  If you are only keeping the car for one year, it's a good buy. <br>  <br>  On the test drive listen out for odd noises, squeeking brakes, clunking steering.  Drive along a straight road and gently release the steering wheel, it shouldn't vere across the road.  Try again, but this time, brake gently - again, the wheel shouldn't pull to one side. It's nothing major if it does (usually wheel re-balancing), but you can use this to knock a few quid off the price.  Check tyre tread and the spare, again, if iffy, knock some money off.  You can get new tyres for about ￡20. <br>  <br>  Oh, and please please please buy a crook lock that goes across the steering wheel.  My Micra was written off by someone actually bending open the door  and trying to hotwire it - typically the one time I didn't crook lock it, gah! |`|3SFxfoHEaa	as cars i think the micra is fairly bullet proof. check for service history and consider getting a service done on it. it's a economical car which should last you a year or so  you get your no claims and trade up.|`|F0hx0Xcgaa	I have got a p reg micra. It is not the comfiest of cars for long distance driving but is a great run about for town and short distance driving. I was very lucky with my car. It was immaculate full service history 88000 on clock and cost ￡500. If the car is as bad as you say then i would hang on for something in better condition to come along or spend maybe a little bit more on something in slightly better condition. If the previous owners havent really lookeddafter the outside of the car then prob havent looked after the engine neither. Maybe look for a nother micra in better condition. I love mine xx|`|6b4c067f6a0eea7c4940121f52da28fdaa	The instructor I had while I was learning to drive had a R reg micra. There nice cars to drive (I now have one! only allot newer on a w reg) They were used as lerner vehicles so you need to look for parking dents and the such. The rear brake cylinders do have a tendency to leak so it would be a good Idea to get it serviced and see if they need replacing. Apart from that nothing much wrong with them.<br>  <br>  Going by what you have mentioned it dose seem to be a good buy. The car will last you ages so if I were you I'd keep it  for a good few years build up your no claims and get some experience after (if haven't all ready) pass your test.|`|1dfaef4eac347071e4f72e9b562c343caa	Generally micra's have a really long lifespan, Micra's never had any severe problems in general. However check out the timing chain because on Micra's I think you gotta change them every 160k miles. Also check the rear brakes for leaking.
43e034875740317aeba41024f05380dcaa	don,t listen to all that say you will burn up your brake,s faster...doing it your way is no different than if you had an automatic...an auto does not down shift either...but down shifting in your manual can cause increased clutch & engine wear..engine braking [ as it is called] will increase engine wear...as long as you anticipate your need to stop long enough in advance ..you will not in cure excessive brake wear.|`|73eb4728618b7c8e1b3a898b23e2f443aa	it's fine it's just going to eat brakepads. You generally only downshift to 2nd and than brake in neutrall to a stop just don't put the car into first untill you have completely stopped. Downshifting is just slightly safer because I you need to stop real quick it helps and if you need to accelerate to avoid an accident or something you just have to hit the gas instead of havng to shift and all.  |`|8BalHcmWaa	Well, it won't do any harm. The only thing is that it will increase brake wear. If you downshift, you can use engine breaking in combination with your brakes. Sometimes you don't even need to use your brakes if you downshift instead.|`|IIa4efh5aa	The way you are doing it, you are losing the effect of engine braking when you stop, increasing the wear on your brake pads. Better to gear down as you come to a stop, put it in neutreal at the stop, and back to first when you start off again.|`|pZ9eA5rYaa	Brakes are a lot cheaper than replacing the clutch. Just push in the clutch and come to a stop. Than shift it into first gear. Down shifting puts additional wear on the clutch and gears. I can't figure out why you don't have control when you are coasting to a stop with the clutch in. That doesn't even make sence.|`|AA11922860	who told you you had to downshift like that before you stop? just engage the clutch and hold it to the floor and your out of gear. then when you stop just put it back into first. that way to if the light turns green before you stop and or slow down, all you would need to do is let up on the clutch and your done. and no, if you put it into neutral it will not hurt the transmission.|`|897f9782bd9356ff775df4cf6a07496faa	I prefer to downshift: less wear on the brakes|`|AA11646252	You are fine and a common thing to do in synced trannies.  If you start driving big trucks (larger than 12 tons) or old trucks (60's) orsuch it is safe and common.  do what feels right to you and you will be fine.  The only thing you do not want to do is feather the clutch at lights.  This is where you are on a hill and keep letting out on the clutch just enough to move forward a bit and back in to stop rolling back and forth.  You are doing fine just keep on.  The more you do the better you get.<br>  <br>  rd|`|h7qkIGsKaa	When you engage the clutch or knock it into neutral you are coasting and do not have full control of the vehicle.<br>  <br>  As you appoach the lights gently apply the brakes and change down gears, re-engaging smoothly between each one, 4, 3, 2. Maintain gentle braking for the whole duration until you come to a halt in second gear; depressing the clutch before you completely stop otherwise you would stall. As soon as you come to a full halt, you put it in first ready to pull away.<br>  <br>  (EDIT - it is not 'fine' as people are telling you, it is dangerous)<br>  <br>  You can go from 4th to 2nd if you have cause to slow down very rapidly, but if you have always gone from 4th to neutral you won't have the automatic response - and if the road is wet...<br>  <br>  I have never heard of 'engine braking'.  I change down to stay in control of the vehicle in conjunction with the brakes - not harshly to make the engine race.<br>  <br>  Larry - When you are coasting you are freewheeling, like rolling down a hill.  The gears maintain control over the revolution of your axles and turning wheels, and the weight/tension is maintained between the wheels and the ground.  Out of gear you go light/top heavy and if you brake suddenly are more likely to skid etc.  And an automatic gearbox does not go out of gear as it changes down.  All UK drivers must pass their drivers test in a manual car if they want to drive one.  If you coasted or came to a halt in the way people are describing hear you would instantly fail as not being in full control of the vehicle and driving dangerously.  Any UK driving instructor will tell you that, even if I cannot explain it very well.<br>  <br>  It is a choice of laziness against safety/control.  In the UK the choice is made for us.  Good luck and all the best!

AA10286987	In stock form the black top is MAP sensored so its way more accurate at reading intake air flow than the red or silver tops with the Air Flow Meter. It has lighter engine internals that help the engine rev up faster. The VVT-i on the black top takes engine RPM, Load and throttle position to determine proper cam timing, while the silver top only changes cam timing based on engine RPM. The black top head ports are designed for better air flow. Black top has Individual throttle bodys like the Silver top but the Red top doesn't. The Black and Silver top have 5 valves per cylinder the Red has 4.

You'll notice significantly better sound with a decent amp.<br>  <br>  The equipment you're running is entry-level, so don't spend too much on an amp unless you plan on upgrading. 75-100 wRMS per side should serve you pretty well. If you want to add a small subwoofer, purchase a stronger 4 channel amplifier and bridge the rear channels, or buy a small mono amp.<br>  <br>  Make sure you set your gains correctly, and sound deadening will also go a long way towards improving the sound.|`|73eb4728618b7c8e1b3a898b23e2f443aa	you dont need an amp with a nice head unit just install them and than if you need more do the rear speakers and if that still isnt enough than get an amp.

Then drive to an auto parts store and have your alternator tested. Alternators don't usually knock, so that could be a whole other problem.|`|yQmRUkjQaa	Well, it could be ur alternator, or ur battery dont hold charge any more. I would take the alternator to get it tested, if thats fine. than is the battery.|`|ov4wvUgpaa	Take it to an auto parts store and have it tested,|`|rNoIND1naa	It may be the alternator. First Iwould check the connections at the battery to make sure they are clean and tight. Then put a volt meter on the battery and record that voltage (should be around 12v). Next jump the car and get it running and take the voltage at the battery again. It should have gone up to 14.7 ish. If it does not go up the alternator is not charging the battery. Make sure it is hooked up right and that all connections are clean.<br>  To see if the alternator is bad, take it off the car and have it tested at a Murrays, AutoZone, etc. Most of those places test alternators. Good luck.<br>  The knocking noise was caused by the timing advance geting thrown off as the comuter looses power and car shuts down. Not a problem.

In New York City, though, there's what's known as an oligopoly, which is where a few existing license (called "medallion") holders make it hard for people to compete with them.  The results of this includes fewer available cabs, hence higher fare prices, less service to certain areas of town that may not be as profitable (ie, "the ghettos"), and other things to generally short-change the consumers and potential consumers.  <br>  <br>  One other thing this oligopoly has done is to make it illegal for cabbies to pick up fares outside the city if they had a fare that was picked up in the city and dropped off outside.  Often, the cabbie will charge double because of this restriction, or just refuse to take you outside the border.  <br>  <br>  Because of the high demand though, the free market's enterprising heroes have attempted to pick up the slack of these wannabe monopolist cab companies.  These are the so-called "gypsy cabs", which are generally regular joes picking up extra spending green by working as cabbies using their own sedans and minivans.  The main downside is that most of them don't carry the same insurance as the official, officious cab companies, but if you're flying into JFK Airport, for example, and need to get to New Jersey and don't want to fork over a whole week's pay just for one ride, they may be your best bet.  Or maybe you should just consider renting a car for just one day :-)<br>  <br>  Another alternative for the NYC area of course is the excellent mass transit system its high population density allows.  |`|k1Rtp6w1aa	I Live in California.

naG0cQn1aa	The Mercury has All Wheel Drive. The Buick and Chevy seem to be 2wd. Would that be important for you? If so, go for the Mountaineer.<br>  But I am very wary about a Mountaineer for less than $9k (especially since has all the options). I'd check out the vin with carfax.<br>  <br>  If you're still looking at the Santa Fe, you may also want to check out it's competitors... Chevy Equinox, Ford Escape, Jeep Liberty... They are at the similar price range.|`|a6fd94a2b14c1b138b16e422179ea782aa	I agree with the guy above me. There's something a little odd about a fully loaded Mountaineer for under 10K..... Or maybe the owner just needs the money now. Trailblazers are pretty good, but if it matters, the interior quality isn't as top notch as the Mountaineer's. Mercury is by far the best choice, with the chevy in second.|`|73eb4728618b7c8e1b3a898b23e2f443aa	I seriously wouldnt buy any buick mercury or chevy. they have horrible reliability ratings and are poorly manufactured. the best for the money would be the sant fe or look into 4runners and highlanders. they are much more reliable and you get way more bang for the buck plus some resale value all the cars you listed will be nearly worthless on resale in like 3yrs. the toyota trucks are the best in the biz hands down.<br>  <br>  toyota has opened more factories in the last 10 yrs than any american car co. every american manufacturer has been consistently closing plants over the last 10yrs and sending the jobs to mexico and overseas. most american cars are manufactured overseas now. <br>  but good luck either way <br>  (get the santa fe)
AA11553774	It's not even as difficult as others are making it sound. there is no problem with your bike. This is a common problem. You just have to get used to the bike. It's difficult to gauge at first how hard you need to hit the lever for that half of a click into neutral. Once you find it, it will become more natural habit and you won't have any issues finding it.|`|E0j6mhqhaa	I don't know about your bike, but most Kawasaki's of any size have the positive neutral finder.  When the bike is stationary, you can downshift through the gears and into 1st and you can upshift to neutral, but it's impossible to shift from neutral into second until the bike itself is moving.<br>  <br>  Maybe someone else out there knows if the 250 has the neutral finder.<br>  <br>  My question is, is the bike actually in neutral even though the neutral light isn't on?  There's a little switch with contacts on the exposed end of the shifting drum located behind the engine cover.  If the bike actually does shift into neutral but it's just the light that doesn't come on, remove the shift lever, cover and clean the switch with carb cleaner or some other solvent.  Also make sure the switch isn't loose and is mounted solidly.|`|AA10268382	Ok this is easy...<br>  there are 2 choices.<br>  A) It's you (Dont laugh) and it will come with practice with this bike<br>  B) Shift linkage is out of adjustment, sloppy or needs greased.<br>  <br>  Both are the most common cause of this problem.|`|pzMGK4Keaa	yeah, the other person is right. itll just take some getting used to maybe, if you arent a very experienced rider. im not sure if you are or not. it could just be that, but maybe it is something else. i cant be sure.
73eb4728618b7c8e1b3a898b23e2f443aa	if all your looking for is a motor and you already have the tranny than it doesn't matter. You may have to change the flywheel like you said but it should be fine. People take autos and make them manual all the time and vise versa. You can even run an auto ecu on manual you just can't do it the other way around. They don't make different motors only diferent trannys.<br>  <br>  to add any components that you would need can easily be taken off of your old motor (torque converter exc..) it really no big deal its done all the time I dont think anyone is reading the question correctly.|`|ePFdhsCYaa	Am I right in saying you are looking for a replacement motor for the car and you want to know if an motor for a manual will fit in an auto?<br>  <br>  I have done this before allthough mine was a manual I just needed to change the flywheel with the torque converter and a few other minor components. |`|pZ9eA5rYaa	If you are just switching out the engine It doesn'tmatter bacause you can use the transmission and parts required for the swap.|`|MGHTJx0Waa	Big difference between Auto & Manual! there are now different types of Automatic, some are manual gearboxes with electric gear shift ie flappy paddles on steering wheel. Others are hydraulic ie Vauxhall Vectra, Signum, & Mercedes etc. Its a mater of choice and preference to what you want. If its a little city car you want then chances are it could be semi automatic. All have no clutch.<br>  <br>  You don't want to get into changing gearboxes from manual to auto.|`|65wpOSEPaa	well auto has a automatic clutch, in other words, it changes gears for you.<br>  manual, you are free to change the gears as you wish. By pushing down the clutch with your foot, and changing the gear with your hand using the gear knob.<br>  that's just put simply.<br>  Most men prefer manual as they can control the speed of their gear changes, thus making the car faster.<br>  All racecars use manual.|`|4u8XHkxuaa	there,s a big difference. a manuel has a clutch and automatic don,t. on some cars all you do is make sure the crank has a place for a pilot bearing and bolt up your flex plate and use your torque converter and use your flywheel.|`|LNkBhGdQaa	you may have a bit of trouble with the tranny being you have an automatic since the manual trannies are 5 speed and i believe the autos are 4.when i did a swap on my car it was an automatic motor so i had to put the flywheel and all from my old motor onto the new one to convert it to manual.|`|W1TeAzkNaa	an auto comes in 2 types: STANDARD-you just put it into drive, park etc<br>  <br>  and<br>  <br>  Tiptronic-is still an auto but is like a semi manual because you can change the gears but you have no clutch<br>  <br>  manual you control the gears, and push the clutch to change<br>  
AhFzNifNaa	Probably not, the flywheel is kinda like your brake rotors and your clutch is like the brake pads. You might want or need to get it turned (resurfaced) but chances are you wont. I would pop it off and take it down to an auto parts place (that you trust) and have them check it over for you. If not just make sure there isn't any obvious scoring on it or uneven wear. Then cross your fingers that it's not warped!<br>  <br>  Veedubs rule!|`|qYRdYjGkaa	I second j2b4o's brief but concise assessment.|`|W1TeAzkNaa	it depends how you treat your clutch, but usually no|`|ePFdhsCYaa	The flywheel on a manual car should not need replace and should last the life if the car. It would take a fare bit of abuse to damage i flyweel in a normally aspirated car.|`|bLjGM9yNaa	<br>     Not necessarily,<br>     You should be able to take the flywheel to a local autoparts/machine<br>     shop and have it machined if it is within specs..<br>  <br>      Don't forget to mark the flywheel prior to removal. Use something<br>      that will not come off at the machine shop...<br>  <br>       Good Luck to you..|`|QpP1xJ4Naa	A spare flywheel can save you time in getting the job done!<br>  To put a new clutch in a car without having the flywheel resurfaced is just throwing money away. You also should have a new pressure plate, throw out bearing and pilot bearing.<br>  I just had a clutch done, it was in and out of the shop in five hours. I had a complete kit (flywheel, pressure plate, throw out bearing, and pilot bearing) for the mechanic to put in. There was another car in the shop having its clutch done too. It was still there when I left. It needed the flywheel turned, and the shop that turns them did not get it back for installation.<br>  If you are doing the job, think about how are you going to get to the machine shop and have it turned. Can you do with out a car for a day to two weeks? What are you going to do if it needs a new one. Better to be prepared then trying to find answers with no time to wait.|`|73eb4728618b7c8e1b3a898b23e2f443aa	flywheels are like rotors they need to either be replaced or re-surfaced when changing the clutch. If there is still alot of meat on it you can have it cut but if it's real worn you need a new one. |`|zlPAVkUBaa	Unless you are racing, the one on it should be fine if it isn't scored.|`|4u8XHkxuaa	if the flywheel don,t have any heat cracks then just have it turned down.

'yodog' said retreds, not retards.  a retred is a tire (usually only trucktires now) that the tread was worn out, so using a super glue type trick they quite literally seal a new set of treads to the old sidewalls.  the problem is they sometimes separate and come flying off.  that is the pieces of truck tire you find laying on the side of a freeway...<br>  <br>  now, it's not an equal comparison since the retred process is different than a tire repair and you aren't putting that kind onf pressure on a car tire.|`|1yWdvMrBaa	Yes, if it was patched properly your tire is as good as new.|`|GBSO1Efraa	ask the people who patched it up.|`|Jj6rL7j5aa	Please just go to Walmart and get a new tire, if its a front tire and you have a blow out you could hit the meridian or anything.

73eb4728618b7c8e1b3a898b23e2f443aa	your not doin anything wit 100$ buy if you save you could get some nice coilovers or lowering springs with new struts and springs (unless it has leaf springs) for power you gotta swap but there is a wealth of cheap motors that swap right in look on toyotanation there is some good info there. but seriously 100 aint gonna get you no where.

He's "bench-racing."<br>  Everything else being equal, the Grand Am would win as it's a touch lighter (maybe a couple hundred pounds.)<br>  And, no, they're not race cars but they have plenty of torquey oomph, particularly given their ability to get over 30 MPG on the highway.|`|73eb4728618b7c8e1b3a898b23e2f443aa	hahahaha<br>  its the same car and the same engine. just different body kit and badges. <br>  3.4=3400 <br>  and by the way they are both way slow..|`|naG0cQn1aa	Actually, you should compare the Impala with the Grand Prix. Both have a base 3.4 liter V6. But both have an available 3.8 V6 (the workhorse engine for GM). They both have a supercharged version which spools out 240 hp.<br>  <br>  The Grand Am is a smaller car. So, technically, the Grand Am would be quicker than the base Impala.

Then after the end result -your gonna be sorry you ever took it there...Alot of orange peel, dull, paint on moldings etc.<br>   Find a guy that restores old cars or a painter-these guys moonlight at night to make extra money for their projects. You'll get a better job-- might even be cheaper...and you'll be able to drive the speed limit without all the paint flying off in chunks!

If the timing belt is worn or jumped a tooth, this will also account for the bad rpm, and you could have a leak in the intake system or manifold.  This will also cause overheating, poor acceleration and clicking sounds.<br>    You really need to have it looked at by a professional because of the multiple issues.|`|oyvRHQmaaa	Timing belt or timing chain has stretched, and jumped time...<br>  <br>  replace belt or chain...500.00-900.00 depending on car.....<br>  <br>  <br>  Sounds like thermostat might be stuck closed tooo...|`|kYsm5fs9aa	Sounds like you may have multiple issues.

It has been done before and doesn't require a lot of custom work, its just bolt-on.|`|JwUHCwcJaa	The front bumpers are actually just polyurethane bumper covers. The bolt holes are exactly the same in both models. Same headlights in both models so fitment won't be any problem. You are safe switching bumpers. The Evo IX bumpers are better looking anyways. The VIII has a very close resemblance with some Pontiac models. Just my opinion...|`|IBuKYbq7aa	Yes it will. It is actually a perfect fit. Same bolt provisions. |`|Ftv9Asl5aa	more than likely it will fit theyre very close in design.|`|3DmeIAf9aa	not quite. you will have to custom shape it because its to small

Intake and exhaust will help a bit but an underdrive pulley will probably give you the most noticable gain.<br>  <br>  That other guys is clueless. Tornados don't do anything.

txybihhXaa	There is really no logical reason for this. The coolant temp sensor is in the right lower radiator hose which attaches to the radiator. And it is controlled by the DME (engine computer) which is located in the engine compartment. The convertible top has sensors on top of the windshield and at the back where it stows into the trunk. And it is controlled by the CVM which is underneath the left rear window.<br>  Perhaps it is just a coincidence. And where does it say "out of range",<br>  is it on the dash or on the video display ?<br>  The only common thing for both is the instrument cluster (which is a gateway), thus if it is not just a coincidence, the cluster is going south.<br>  Your problem is not a do it yourself thing. Only a trained BMW technician having a GT1/DIS can diagnose this problem. Do not fall for<br>  self-proclaimed BMW experts. Bring your car to a dealer or to a reputable BMW independent shop (not any shop).|`|Y5DEupmraa	You have a short in your system, or a fuse is blown. Check your fuse block. Also, your sensor leads could be grounding from some reason, causing it to go crazy.
AA12339318	It is NOT better for the car.  The crumple zones protect the PEOPLE in the car.  If parts of the car absorbe part of the impact, they slow the car down slightly before the passengers feel the impact.<br>  <br>  Slower speeds mean less injury.<br>  <br>  Think about the giant airbags that stuntmen use when they fall from a great highth.  The stunt man hits the bag at the same speed he would have had he jumped straight onto concrete.  But the bag "crumples," slowing him down and cushioning the impact.|`|wpgRMjgraa	For protection to your body, its better for an object to crumple rather than having it not and your body hitting it solid......|`|8cee89129dada555e68d08fe2985fbd5aa	my husband has wrecked to dodge ram pick ups the first one he went about 4miles a sleep took out a bobwire fence and went head first in a pond and the air bag never went off, well he just went into a concrete barrier on the interstate 3wks ago and the air bag never went off then either..................We have been told that if the impact is not right where the bar is that holds the gold ball sensors that rols down and tells the other one to go off then the impact did not hit the area |`|73eb4728618b7c8e1b3a898b23e2f443aa	when the car crumbles in an accident it's to absorb as much of the impact as possible. If they diddnt crumble the force of the impact would be delivered to the driver rather than the car. |`|JKQhSGEEaa	if your car didnt crunch up then it would be like hitting a brick wall and all it takes to kill you is a 30mph sudden stop because your organs are still moving and when your body stops your dead|`|pZ9eA5rYaa	The car absorbs the impact not the driver.|`|iiUQzGPLaa	Yes. Think about it, which is better, to have the car body crumple and absorb the energy of impact, or to have the human body crumple and absorb that same energy? Studies with crash dummies indicate that injuries are reduced by having the car body absorb impact energy as long as the collapse does not intrude into the passenger compartment.

4MtR8MLpaa	They are there for the driver to use when the driver understands his needs given the road conditions. As for downshifting no worries as the transmission will make the shift until it is safe for the engine to do so.<br>  <br>  Being able to start on icy roads in 2 or 3 is an advantage as it reduces the chance of wheel spin.<br>  <br>  As you say, keeping the transmission from up shifting creates a braking effect which is nice to have on long downhill roads where the brakes could overheat.<br>  <br>  When pulling a heavy load it maybe easier on the car's engine and transmission to keep it in 3 as the engine may lug if it shifts into overdrive.<br>  <br>  As you say, it gives the driver an option over boring automatic.<br>  <br>  And another reason is they can for very little added cost and it gives them a selling feature.|`|jYy6dDAZaa	The gear selector is for pulling, most auto don't pull loads well in Drive.3 goes  faster than 2 but the auto feature still works it starts in 1 shifts to 2 then 3|`|j6IxZhNlaa	1,2,3 are for you to drive through the first three gears as you please you can change them instead of the box doing it,when you get to the top of your third gear you then can put it into D for the rest of the gears the box has to offer|`|QpP1xJ4Naa	The purpose is just as you describe or in the case of long down grades to limit the top end and use the engine as a brake.<br>  Yes these can damage the transmission.|`|BrodO8UBaa	d=overdrive<br>  3=3rd gear<br>  2=2nd gear<br>  1=1st gear<br>  the trans will only down shift if the governor speed allows it to .<br>  and yes you can hurt the trans if you abuse it by trying to force it to do what it is not supposed to do.<br>  and yes you can shift it like a manual trans without damage <br>  as long as you don't abuse it!<br>  <br>  just remember if you keep a transmission in a lower gear to use it as a break you also raise the temperature of the transmission fluid causing it to burn and break down sooner than it normally would.<br>  the same occures when you stomp on it and keep it from up shifting !<br>  and i would much rather pay to have my brakes worked on than to have my transmission worked on!

c48nm70gaa	It's not necessary to "warm-up" a car sitting in a driveway for the following reasons: Assuming you are using your car's recommended low viscosity motor oil It really best to start your car and drive a mile or two at 30 MPH then at the posted speed limit. <br>  <br>  It's difficult to understand this procedure but the car will use less fuel but at the same time will warm up the coolant and engine oil faster. It's the thermostats job to warm the car's motor as soon as possible to it's maximum value. <br>  <br>  At any outside ambient temperature the faster the engine reaches maximum temperature it will drive off condensation and engine oil blow-by contaminants under normal driving conditions. When a car sits idling in a driveway there's no load on the motor. It wastes fuel, warms up very slowly and doesn't do a very good job of driving off crankcase contamination.|`|73eb4728618b7c8e1b3a898b23e2f443aa	the best way to warm up a car is by driving it. it circulates and warms the oil and other fluids far faster and better than allowing it to idle.<br>  however you shouldn't really take the rpms past 3k on most cars until running temp is reached.<br>  so just drive slow until its fully warmed.|`|AA11661950	Start it up and let it run until the idle speed has been lowered to normal by your car's on-board computer. After that drive slow for the first 2 miles, then drive as you normally do. Letting your car set and idle until it warms up is a waste of time and gasoline. It does nothing for the car.|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	cars motor only takes a few seconds to move oil doesnt need much time at all warming car only long enough to clear window fine but doesnt need or have to be warmed much more than that new or old if your able to get in and go its good just dont hit  highway speed for a minute or two|`|apWnNH3Paa	Yes, My car deserves it. I also don't want to get in a freezing car so I let the car run so I can be warm when it's very cold outside.|`|wOtAIAcLaa	First let me just say that synthetic oil is the way to go in extreme weather.<br>  So, that said, if you have synthetic oil, then all you need is a couple mins to get your car ready. If you want to warm the car so it is nice and warm when you get in then that is personal preference. It wont help the car or hurt it.|`|r8DTmqHLaa	cold weather makes your oil run thicker, so you should let it run for a minute. less problems with synthetic oils 5w30 is best for cold.|`|LSqFxEaJaa	Not Necessary, but will be better for the car in the long run. It would be worth doing if you are trying to take good care of the car.|`|g4XVlvSoaa	Not really, but it sure feels better to get in a warm car!  Drive under 35 mph until it warms up, your vehicle will last longer.|`|e1ec036988398a4d89da52072850d37daa	No.  Usually you should just take it easy until the car warms up.|`|dVQdswtTaa	Mechanically, no, a car doesn't need to be warmed up before driving. <br>  <br>  However, I live in an area that gets very cold, and is near the ocean. I have experienced times when I've driven off in a cold car, and when I topped a hill the windshield rapidly iced over. I had to roll down the window to ease over to the shoulder and wait for the car to warm up so I could see. <br>  <br>  When there is freezing rain, a warm windshield will keep it from building up. Your own breath can quickly frost the inside of a cold windshield.<br>  <br>  While it may be environmentally bad to sit and idle, I think it's worse to die in a wreck because you can't see.
