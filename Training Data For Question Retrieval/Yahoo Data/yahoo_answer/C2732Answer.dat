AA11404742	Sounds more like a hairball.  When cats groom, they swallow some hair.  This accumulates until they bring it back out.  You can minimize this or even eliminate it by brushing them, especially now when they are shedding their winter coat, and by giving them a feline laxative or hairball remedy that helps them pass the hair through their digestive system.  Ask at the pet store, or the pet section of the grocery store got this product.<br>  <br>  And for brushing, I recommend a brush called a Furminator.  You'll be amazed at how much hair you get out of them.  It's not cheap - they're something like $25.  But it helps eliminate that sound of the feline digestive system operating in reverse - usually about 3 AM, when you're jarred out of a sound sleep.|`|inST4SlAaa	it is a hair ball and not a big deal, just disgusting to look at|`|Ow6lKFXiaa	Next time it happens look again.  Most likely you'll see fur mixed with this debris.  If so, than it's a hairball and is normal.  Cats ingest fur when they groom.  As the fur builds up in the digestive tract, it catches food particles.  Frequently this mass cannot be passed out of the system in the usual manner and the cat then vomits it out.  You can cut down on them by brushing your cat regularly. <br>  <br>  If there is absolutely no fur that you can see then take the suggestion from another answerer above and place a sample in a bag and deliver to your vet for identification.|`|1H0vYaJxaa	Have you looked closely at the animals' teeth? I would start there if the cat is missing teeth then naturally it is not chewing its food hence the vomiting. <br>  <br>  Also cats have sensitive stomachs I would look into getting another brand of cat food. Sometimes the cheaper food is better for the animal. <br>  <br>  Keep an eye out for blood, or worms in the vomit and of course if the animal is loosing weight then I would contact the vet. <br>  <br>  I know that my mother's cat, when Penny gets mad it will vomit. Just a fyi|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	sound like hairballs, they look like poop.  next time, put it in a baggie (the vomit, not the cat) and bring to the vet to identify it.|`|84558de0349fa374ed3605ac33e8e36daa	My cat does that sometimes when she ate too fast. It comes up right after she's done eating and it looks like a big sausage of smashed catfood.|`|RkNIs0rSaa	Sounds like she may be eating to fast...  slow her down by controlling portions and Laxatone.. it is a hairball treatment.. if cats get hairballs and eat.. the food won't pass and then it comes right back up.|`|MlQ0GIpoaa	Are you sure they're not hair balls?
39a2d5e9bc3c417cbdc5ba33cb6386bbaa	Those fish aren't compatible.  The gouramis and silver dollars are tropical and need a heated tank.  The goldfish and koi are coldwater.  Koi are pond fish and aren't really suited for a tank.  Silver dollars are schooling fish.|`|eyKx05LKaa	Yes what everyone else said before me.  I just want to also stress that your Silver Dollars are schooling fish.  You should have at least 6 or they will be stressed.  And to reiterate what the first person said, please educate yourself.  These fish are in your care and your responsibility to keep them healthy, happy and comfortable.  Certain fish have certain needs and you need to find out what they are before you purchase them.   Seriously!|`|QrjjiOgTaa	nope. please research your fish. tropicals and goldfish do not mix. and you think 2 koi??? they are going to outgrow your tank.|`|H0fXySX9aa	no they cant gouramis silver dollars are tropical<br>  common gold fish and kois are cold water koi being a pond fish<br>  educate your self please|`|MFZr5yhAaa	goldfish and koi are coldwater species.<br>  SO NO.<br>  <br>  They need their own tank.
1H0vYaJxaa	how old is this animal? animals will loose hair as well as go grey like humans. <br>  I would just keep an eye on her/him and as long as they are still eating and not loosing weight then I would not worry.<br>  You may also want to look at the cats fur and make sure that they did not get into any insects such as mites, fleas. <br>  Check out this link and it may help you. Good luck|`|PAtbjVCoaa	Take her to the vet but it could also be she is shedding her winter coat and getting her spring coat|`|zpwJR60baa	Hi, cat loosing hair, is a sign of kidney failure.  If you have finance problem, I would take it to the local SPCA, they help people with finance problem.|`|KfKr3hUmaa	Take her to the vet. She prbly has mites.
RT8LZy7gaa	If the cats have fleas, they can get tapeworms by injesting the fleas while grooming themselves.  This is VERY common! This is easy enough to resolve and doesn't have to be expensive.<br>  <br>  If the medicine is in pill form, crush it with the back of a spoon and mix it with good smelly tuna (just enough so you know they'll eat all of the tuna) or some other wet food they're crazy for. This is how I got a cat to take antibiotics.<br>  <br>  Checking them for fleas is easy and diagnosing tapeworms is easy. Look on their bellies and see if you see what looks like dirt. Comb some of it out and add a little water. If it turns rusty red, it's flea poop.  <br>  <br>  If your cats have little rice like bits stuck to their bottoms, thats tapeworm segments.<br>  <br>  To get rid of fleas you have to treat the cat and the environment.  Biospot makes an excellent, and cheap, product.  I recommend the spray for the cats (it's like $10 or so), get them good and moist.  This will kill most of the adults on contact or within a few hours.  Biospot also makes some liquid you put behind their heads that lasts 4 weeks to kill anything that jumps on them from the house.<br>  <br>  Last, boispot also makes a room spray.  You need to spray around baseboards and on the carpet. Wash any bedding the cats sleep on. Then vacuum and trash the bag (you'll suck up eggs and adults). Do this every week for at least a month.  Fleas hatch every 14 days or so.  Once the adults die, either by the spray or biting the treated cat, your problem should be resolved in about a month if you keep at it.<br>  <br>  This is the only type of worm an indoor cat typically picks up.  Fleas can get in the house simply by hitching a ride on your pants leg! They're everywhere, especially if you have a neighbor with outside dogs or lots of squirrels around.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  I used the method above for a stray I took in and now he's flea free (except I didnt have fleas in my house - I noticed the fleas on him right away and began treatment before they could jump off him). I now keep him on the behind the neck liquid and a flea collar on him just in case I missed one!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|RMVvU6Vcaa	How did you get medicine for them if they havent been to the vet ? Any over the counter stuff probably won't take care of the issues. You can see if you can get a specific type of credit card for the vet. That way you can pay it off after in low payments instead of having to pay up-front. Worms will make them very sick, and possibly kill them. I would for sure be calling every vet and animal hospital to see what can be done. Remember, they can't help themselves they are counting on their momma/daddy to help them.|`|pC5SWxC3aa	They got contaminated ten years ago, or while in your house. <br>  <br>  You see we as cats and kittens may contract worms in several ways.<br>  <br>  -I can ingest  soil and plant material contaminated with worm ova<br>  -I can be exposed to feces containing worm ova<br>  - I can ingest fleas that harbor worm ova, something that you might have brought into the house unknowingly. <br>  - I could have been nursed by a contaminated mother<br>  - Or I could have been eating a contaminated prey such as mice and birds, while trying to satisfy some human that cant afford pest control services. <br>  <br>  It may also interest and alarm you to know that it is possible for you to ingest worm ova shed by us cats, although the parasites are unable to complete their life cycle within your body. This is one good reason to keep us off your tables and counter tops!|`|j45Q2ipRaa	It is easy for animals to pick up the parasites so don't think there is anything you could have done differently. <br>  <br>  You said that you bought worming medicine for them, but they don't like it.  You could possibly mix it into wet food and make sure each eats there portion each day.  If they aren't eating it, I wouldn't offer them anything else unless it continues.<br>  <br>  With money being tight, there are animal shelters, etc that will provide care for your girls at little to no cost as they sponsor low and fixed income care.  It make take a little looking but I don't know where you are so can't get any direction there.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  Things will work out.|`|HwEdMNmraa	If you can see worms then they are likely to be tapeworms. They look like wriggling grains of rice at the cat's anus or in the litter tray. If they are house cats and never hunt or are given raw meat then the most likely source of infection is from fleas. Buy a worming treatment that kills tapeworms and de-flea the cats regularly.|`|RkNIs0rSaa	Contact your local animal control.  some towns offer low cost vet services.  At pet stores, they sell pills for worms in cats...  and you just follow the instructions and they will go away.  They can get worms from eating a flea, flies, or meat that has gone bad.  Fleas come in on us and then jump off to animals, even if your cat never goes outside... they can still have them.  you will want to get them on a monthly flea/tick preventative.|`|swQz4R2Iaa	If my mums cats need medicine, she forces them to have it. Open there mouth, throw tablet in, hold mouth shut, eventually they will swallow it. Point is, they obviously need the medicine, so a little discomfort for a greater good is definitely better.|`|KfKr3hUmaa	Put the medicine in cheese or grind it intot their food or water.|`|AA12395964	If they didn't have worms for all ten years and never went outside the only thing I can think is maybe there is a mouse or something in your house which either had worms and they ate it... or they (gross i know) ate the worm eggs from the feces of someting like a rat or mouse ???<br>  <br>  <br>  you should really get them to take the medicine and attempt to raise some money for the vet because worms can also be dangerous to humans so be careful and good luck|`|Zd4nUC33aa	Just try and give them the medicine.<br>  It could be cause there bums arent kept clean.<br>  Wrap the pills up in there favouriate food|`|IWbFqtQ3aa	Call an animal rescue group, many of them have resources to help out someone on a fixed income. There are many types of worms that they can get. When I have to give mine medication, I find the easiest way to do it is to crush the pills up and mix them with a little "people" tuna. They'll think it's a cat treat and eat it right up.|`|cSqx1DxKaa	The smart thing to do would be to take them to a shelter where someone who can afford their treatment will be able to take care of them.  But you didn't want any smart comments, so...<br>  <br>  You didn't say what kind of worms they have.  If they have tapeworms, then there are also fleas present.  I do not recommend over the counter wormers, as they are harsh and won't cover the full spectrum of worms anyway.  Wormer from the vet is not expensive.  If you can't afford even that, then I'm sorry but you cannot afford cats period.  What would happen if they needed emergency medical care?|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	im sorry, but they need a vet.<br>  <br>  the only worming that works is at the vets. also, there are many types of worms, vet will determine which one they are.<br>  <br>  call vet, tell them your financial situation, see if they will wait for their money or if they can suggest a shelter that will do it for free.<br>  <br>  there should be services for the disabled in your area that can refer you.<br>  <br>  edit - krennao, good catch. i usually spot them, but this one got by me. i thought it was an adult, disabled person.<br>  i had to go half way though his questions before i saw the "im 16 and my math teacher is fat "question.<br>  which would make him 6 when he rescued the kittens. from the road.|`|AV3YACAZaa	I would call a vet and tell them your situation--ask if they can at least recommend an over-the-counter worm medicine since you can't afford to come in and get a prescription for one. <br>  <br>  You need to make them take the medicine even if they don't want it. They'll fight you for sure :D|`|inST4SlAaa	mix it with wet cat food.  my cats have had worms and i had problems too until i mixed it with wet cat food.  do not use a lot of wet food to be sure they eat it all in one feeding<br>  <br>  i think that people who have rude comments are ignorant.  not every one has money to take them to the vet<br>  <br>  you did a wonderful thing by taking them in and giving them a loving home.|`|2697c1729e017f780327da8beda5c294aa	SInce your in school, you wouldn't have an income, So ask your parents.

7HEZhx46aa	There are no legal requirements unless the bird turns out to be ill with a highly infectious disease that puts all the other birds in that store at risk.<br>  This is why you should NEVER EVER EVER buy a bird from any pet store. Go directly to the breeder and you'll never have any doubts.<br>  Vaccinations for birds are not required, but good breeders will vaccinate against things like polyoma (one of the breeders I got one of my caiques from gives all their birds their first two shots for polyoma virus.)<br>  <br>  People ***** and moan about pet stores getting their dogs from puppy mills, but they don't care where their birds come from. Don't buy birds from places like Petco and they'll stop selling them.|`|qeOlkRM0aa	No. There are no legal requirements for breeders of birds regarding vaccination documentation. Just what vaccinations are you expecting to get papers for?|`|pYF9KnNeaa	Your first problem here is that you got it from a pet store.  And, one of the worst.  You  can never really pin them down about where a bird really comes from because they only deal with bird mills.  Think puppy mill only worse.  Truly reputable breeders will not deal with these large chain stores types of pet stores.  To my knowledge, there is no law stating they have to produce any type of paper work, unless you had the agreement in writing up front, when you bought the bird.  They will continue to give you the run around and have excuses that will last longer than your patience.  You can continue to try but they will reach a point where they will tell you to just bring the bird back and get your refund.  By that time, you will probably be so attached, they know you will not do that.  You best bet is to file a complaint against them with your local Better Business Bureau.  Beyond that, all you can do is learn how to care for the bird the best you can, forget about trying to force them to do as you ask, and make it a lesson learned about this kind of low life pet store.  Now, if they actually gave you the name of a breeder, you will be lucky if it is the truth, and luckier still if you can actually locate them.  I can only wish you luck with it.  If you'd like to post another question telling me what kind of bird you have, I'll be glad to help you all I can with the specifics of it's diet, (it can't live on only seeds), safety issues about toxins in your home and anything else you'd like to ask.
D1beU6MPaa	Being passed from owner to owner is enough to give any dog strong issues. She has never been able to get used to having anyone pay her a lot of attention. I have a lot of experience with dogs and have usually been able to settle a lot of issues through my experience. It is very rare that I would advise anyone to consult an animal behavioralist, but in your case, I think it is well advised. This dog has had no stability in her life, and does not know what you want her to do. With having so many previous owners all giving her different instructions, she is confused. She probably wants to please you, but has no idea of how to go about it. That said, I would contact your vet and see if they could give you some advice or contacts that can help you with these issues. Good luck to you.|`|Rx7wv4JLaa	I highly highly suggest seeing a professional behaviorist, not a trainer. <br>  <br>  I do have a dog with some fear aggression issues that in my opinion are pretty severe. But only a professional can help you.|`|t2M1kXY4aa	You definitely need to find a behavioral specialist to work with this dog.  People here can give you advice (I won't even try), but you need someone to work directly with the dog.<br>  <br>  It sounds like this poor dog was badly abused at some point and has suffered severe psychological damage.<br>  <br>  I HATE to even say this and for all those who WILL thumbs-down my answer, I am NOT recommending this, but sometimes a dog can't be saved no matter how hard you try.  If you exhaust all your options and don't make progress, the kindest thing to do is put the dog down.  Sorry.|`|zeTGmB3faa	This poor dog has really gone through some bad times so thank you for helping her. Since she has issues using the yard to relieve herself, try taking her out every two hours and stay with her while she is outside. When she is done, say "come on, lets go back in". This way she will finally learn that once outside, she is welcome back in the house and may lose those abandonment issues. With taking her out every two hours, the need to feel that she should be punished won't exist and she will start trusting more. The key is consistence and she has  never had it before and is afraid of losing you too.|`|JfBzzXQ4aa	Why is she being punished for going to the bathroom in the house??? Any mistake a dog makes during housebreaking is YOUR mistake, not the dog's. A mistake only happens when you don't properly supervise. Because of this dog's rocky beginnings, this dog is not going to do well with corrections. So......when you do any kind of training with her you avoid corrections, PERIOD! You show her the correct behavior & praise & treat that. Anything other than the correct behavior, you ignore & show her the right behavior. You have to help her learn to trust & teach her what a good dog needs to know. Correcting her when she doesn't understand only keeps her from trusting you on any level. So patient, 100% consistency is what she needs. Then she will learn to trust you. As she learns to trust you she can relax & feel secure in her home, her issues with attention & abandonment will get better & better. Training also helps to build the bond between a rescue dog & new owner. It will help her be a much more confident dog too. As far as playing with toys goes. She may want to play with toys some when she feels more confident & secure & she may never play with toys. Certainly not a big concern either way. She can lead a happy life just playing with you & your other dogs. So start out fresh with this little girl with a new attitude.  Remember she is essentially like a puppy in an adult dog body. She needs to learn everything a good dog needs to know from the ground up. You can teach her. It's not too late. TOTALLY POSITIVE training &100% consistency is how to do it. If you ever feel frustrated with her during training, STOP! Sit down, take her in your arms & give her some loves. Remember it will take baby steps & it won't happen overnight. But your patience will pay off in the end.<br>  Good Luck.

Unless you want to hatch some eggs, remove them from the nest box and put them in a pen so that they can't get back in to sit, but the others can so that they can lay in the nest boxes.

AoSeHXeQaa	The same way you would stop a dog from barking at anything:<br>  <br>  When he barks, get up, and check to see why he is barking. If he is barking at something or someone you do not want him to bark at, tell him NO. (For some dogs, this is all it takes).<br>  <br>  If he ignores you, reach down and touch him firmly on the neck, and repeat NO.<br>  <br>  If he is too focused on what he is barking at to respond, then get a small spray bottle (or even a water bottle), and splash or spray him. Once you have his attention, then repeat NO. After a couple of sessions, you shouldnt need the water any more.<br>  <br>  I am fostering a spoiled chihuahua who attacks the television. All she has to do is see me pick up the water bottle, and suddenly she can hear me just fine :o)<br>  <br>  At the door, it also helps to make the dogs back away from the door, and sit before you open it.

2Ku4DuvCaa	Most likely it would be the terrier. Dogs are predator animals while parrots are prey. Granted, a larger parrot like a macaw would probably get a few good bites in. Or would just fly away. <br>  <br>  My reasoning that the dog would win, however, comes from the fact that dogs and cats have a whole lot of bacteria living under their claws and in their mouths that parrots have little if not no immunity to. Even if the parrot got a bite in and managed to get away, if the dog was able to scratch or bite the parrot (assuming the parrot didn't bleed to death from it), it's very possible that it would succumb to the bacteria and die soon after. Or just die from the shock.<br>  <br>  A bite or scratch from a cat or dog to a parrot, or any bird, is almost a death sentence if the wound is not immediately cleaned and cared for. <br>  <br>  Now have the greatest hope that you're asking this question out of curiosity and NOT because you intend to create those circumstances. It takes a sick, sad individual to do something like that and be okay with it, and I hope you're not one of them.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, I know that such sick, sad individuals exist for a fact because of the condition that some of the parrots we have at the shelter I volunteer for show up in. <br>  <br>  If it's just a curiosity question, then I hope I've been able to answer it thoroughly for you. If it's a question that you've asked with intention to act upon, then PLEASE reconsider. That's a horrible and disgusting thing to do.|`|20ccea7fa7f3ddbfe3a11c22cf8097ddaa	Who would win in a fight between a parrot and a west highland terrier?<br>  <br>  Depending on the bird I think the vet would be the big winner.

bI7wMCJXaa	There was actually a study done that only a very, very small per centage of females interested in equines before and during puberty maintain that interest after the age of 13-14.<br>  <br>  You would be amazed at the effect the environment at your barn will have on you, how you feel about yourself and how you feel about horses. I think you should honestly evaluate what's going on at the barn you're at now to find out what is the root of what's getting you down. Is it because other people's horses seem to be easier/better/prettier/more expensive? Is it because it feels like everyone can ride better than you?<br>  <br>  When looking at barns the type of owner usually dictates the type of people that ride there. I went from a Hunter barn where the owner verbally abused me and told me I knew nothing, to a Western Barn where the owner didn't feed my horse, to a Dressage barn where the trainer was knowledgeable and wonderful. Out of the three the Dressage barn had no snobs. There are $20k and up horses there (I had a little OTTB) and no one looked down on my horse because of his price. My supportive non-snobby trainer attracted supportive, non-snobby boarders.|`|iiNAJfGCaa	I have the same problem over the winter. Cold weather does not equal a want to ride! What helps me is this: every week I sit down and make up a "goal" chart for what I want to accomplish with my horse. It can include anything from getting his mane pulled to practicing flying lead changes. When I write things down I feel more compelled to go out and do them. You can also come up with a monthly training plan for your mare. Set a goal for yourselves (such as entering a certain show) and work towards that goal. Good luck! And ignore those other snobby barn people. They may have "amazing" horses but I bet they couldn't train your mare like you have.|`|m9ypuTViaa	you have to be proud of your horses. dont compare those others to your horse. your horses are special. focus on their improvements. and make friends there if there are any. im 16 too, and i dont ever want to be anywhere except the barn. make some horse friends, or some not horse friends. you need to balance your life out, then the rest will fall into place|`|1uR2zPnEaa	you are SO lucky to have all that free time to spend with your horse<br>  lucky you have a barn to ride at!!<br>   i'm not sure why you would be down? maybe your just growing out of the horse stage? it happens... and then years later people will get back into it. but i for one can't understand WHY or HOW people get tired of horses... but i do know.. when things in life get you down.. you also get dow about horses.. like when i was going through life crisis.. and serious problems .. i never rode once.. i forgot to buy feed for my horses one time,,, and it was just a horrible mess...

YzhZCs3Naa	I agree with the first answer, she looks to be about 5-6 weeks. Gestation is between 57-70 days (these are the early and late extremes). Keep a close observation of her behavior. A few days before she will spend most of her time in her chosen nesting area, making sure her scent is strong in that area for the kittens when they arrive. When she's ready she will become very restless and lose her appetite. When you start seeing this, get ready for kittens :) <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|DEdtNBBSaa	Subject to interpretation, but I think 7weeks is about right.

81675c7bcc2aa81478472216e01229f7aa	DOGS ARE NOT DISPOSABLE!!!  Euthanasia should only be considered if the dog is uncontrollably vicious and all revenues of rehabilitation have been exhausted or when the quality of life is gone.  Many times an aggressive dog CAN be rehabilitated - a yapper can be trained and even a dog that chases can be trained to "leave it".<br>  <br>  Speaking of incontinence, I had a Min Pin that became incontinent when she got older.  She would pee on my bed, in her bed, on the floor - to me, that was not a reason to euthanize.  I got her vet care and she was on medication to help the sphincter muscle.  (I forget the name of the medication)  I also bought pads for her and a new bed for each of us!<br>  <br>  I ultimately had to put her to sleep when she developed a heart condition. (enlarged heart)  But, she wasn't euthanized right away.  She was on Lasix and Digoxen for about a year until her condition became no longer treatable and she was having such a difficult time breathing.<br>  <br>  I want to add that Min Pins were originally bred to hunt.  My children had a couple of hamsters that once in a while would get out of their cage and I wouldn't know where the heck they were at, so I would tell my Min Pin to "find the Bubba's".  She never missed and she NEVER went after them.  She KNEW what "off" meant.  So, I know dogs CAN be trained not to go after other animals even though they might want to.  I also had 2 Cockatiels that she never bothered.<br>  <br>  I understand the overpopulation problem and being that there's limited space, they think the less than perfect ones must die.  However, euthanizing is not the answer.  The answer is making people accountable and responsible when they decide to get a dog.  What I don't understand is the irresponsibility of people that just dump puppies at the shelter because they were too damn stupid to get their dog fixed in the first place or wanted to breed because they think their dog is "cute" or because they dog developed a behavioral problem and they are too damn lazy to put any effort into working with the dog.  Grrr!  If there were not a population problem, the shelters would be more willing to rehabilitate.<br>  <br>  I know it's a very controversial subject and many disagree with me, but I believe in mandatory spaying/neutering for MOST pet owners (not all) and mandatory educational classes BEFORE the adoption.  If people would only take on the responsibility themselves, this wouldn't even be a subject.|`|QnJvJ67uaa	Euthanasia should be performed in only 2 instances<br>  1) When a dog is in unmanageable pain (accident or chronic illness).<br>  2) When a dog attacks a person, not a nip but a pin down attack.<br>  <br>  People have this misty eyed vision of dog owning, that it will all be frolicking in the park and little tommy snuggled on the floor with family pooch.<br>  All is well till little Tommy gets bit because he is using aggressive body language and no -one thought to clamp down on the nippy, boisterous behaviour that was soooo cute when pooch was a wee pup, but now he's 100 lb of dog and little tommy is smaller than him and ..well, you get the rest.<br>  We have a border collie, she has nipped twice.<br>  Once when my son was on the floor with her and rolled over accidental hurting her, and another when a visiting child got on the floor and stuck her face in the dogs face.<br>  Luckily she is a BC and not a bull terrier type, she snapped but never connected, both incidents where not HER fault. She now lives in the barn when children visit, she is getting old and her eyesight is failing, it made her insecure in her role in our "pack".<br>  A modern materialist society has turned dogs and other pets into consumer objects...and if its defective...well they can always take it back..right??|`|fOLO4TNhaa	Euthanasia for health reasons is only necessary when the dogs quality of life is not how it should be. If the dog will not enjoy life, and will suffer thats when Euthanasia is the answer. Plain and Simple and to the dang point!!|`|aCqSF87Raa	In my mind euthanasia is only the answer if the dog's quality of life is poor - either due to medical reasons OR behavioral reasons that can't be worked with or controlled. What this means is open to interpretation but should be diagnosed as "hopeless" by a professional - like a vet or behaviorist. NOT an owner who says "my dog won't potty outside, i hate her."<br>  <br>  So NO: in my opinion dogs should not be euthanized for doing what they were bred to do (border collies chasing and nipping for example.) Any behaviorist would tell an owner that, however not all owners would do that much work for a dog others may describe as "dangerous." In our society at this time, a bite is a bite, and "by law" a dog that bit a child would be condemned no matter the breed.<br>  <br>  Acceptable Situations:<br>  <br>  Medical Problems (that would require heavy medication, extensive medical care, etc for life and may or may not ease suffering in the mean time.)<br>  <br>  Extreme dog or animal aggression (as it's almost impossible to make sure the dog would NEVER be in a situation with other dogs/animals and most regular dog owners would not be able to control reactions.. and it would be a bad idea to re-home such a dog for the same reason.)<br>  <br>  Extreme human aggression (to the point where the dog could not be handled, which means the dog would not get proper exercise or ever be in a loving home.)<br>  <br>  Extreme fear (to the point where the dog could not settle, is always anxious, could not be walked, etc.)<br>  <br>  Lifelong abuse or neglect resulting in any of the above.<br>  <br>  NOT Acceptable:<br>  <br>  "My Border Collie chases the cats." - Dog was bred to herd, should have done your research and prepared for this.<br>  <br>  Poor training or lack of "obedience."<br>  <br>  Minor medical problems like an abrasion or cut.<br>  <br>  Can't afford the vet care.|`|6fbceac9cf90144163110ddd1dbca2b6aa	I think the bottom line is that everybody has their own opinion on when to put an animal to sleep, and in ALOT of cases it's unnecessary. I personally think that the vet should be able to refuse in certain situations. I was once given the choice to ether medicate my cat daily for the rest of her life (she had a heart condition) or put her to sleep. As she was already elderly, hated taking pills and had been blind for a number of years I decided I couldn't put her through anymore suffering and put her to sleep. I couldn't help wonder though, would the same options be given to the owner of a young, otherwise fit cat? I hate to think.|`|rXMTdUg4aa	I can tell you do not agree with euthanasia in these circumstances and I must agree. The fact of the matter is... euthanasia is the answer when the owner of the dog says it is and has the money to pay for it. I've seen dogs put down for incredibly selfish reasons on the owners behalf. Thankfully, most of the time an animal is put down (where I work anyway) it is because the dog is very old and is dieing anyway. In that case... I see nothing wrong with putting an animal out of its misery and letting it drift to sleep. I only wish they did the same for those of us humans with terminal illnesses who wanted to end their suffering.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	Wow,you actually got one sane ADULT answer....how'd that happen here?

S/he can be train or educated or controlled any way|`|6SeWCfUfaa	You're right.  We should just euthanise the stupid, lazy people that drop these dogs off at the shelter instead.  That would solve the problem.|`|3O6CTb3saa	HI  there euthanasia is always a terrible hard thing and it depends on how much u love your dog.  If the animal is in severe pain and nothing helps and its old and cant even move or set up or drink or eat on its own then a person needs to think of making them more comfortable with a forever sleep.  We tend to keep animals here on earth with us longer even when they are miserable because we don't want to let go.  I have even been guilty of that.   I just loved them so much.  If it's dog that has behavioral problems people get other chances why shouldn't a dog?  The Dog Whisperer Caesar Milan can handle any dog with any problem so why cant that animal have a chance?    As u can see i am not for euthanasia if it a behavioral problem as they can be corrected.  Terriers chasing and killing cats and rabbits is the breed.  I have border collies that chase and kill jack rabbits and you know what its ok with me as we have over 5oo jack rabbits this year eating our trees.<br>  Incontinence of a dog can be taken care of as in papers and pads and actually doggy diapers so i guess it depends on how much work u want to put into the dog that was your buddy and pal for many years and true to you the whole time.  Personally if the dog is not in any severe pain i would put up with it but that's me.  Thanks for letting me vent.|`|FQmZLqMdaa	Euthanasia is only the answer when the animal cannot be treateds for it's ailment & is in lots of pain & is suffering.<br>  <br>  As a way of correcting a problem with behaviour it is unacceptable. The idiot owners should learn how to educate a dog before they get a cute little puppy.  They make my blood boil.<br>  <br>  All dogs nip at some time or other so according to that rule all dogs should be DEAD.<br>  <br>  If all dogs that chase/kill cats/rabbits were euthanised we would have no dogs especially Whippets, Greyhounds & racing/lamping & coursing dogs (only racing is now permitted but that is what these breeds were bred for).<br>  <br>  Eccentricity is allowed.  Also being old & senile is also allowed.<br>  People should learn to be more responsible. <br>  <br>  I believe that before people are allowed to keep a dog for the first time they should be made to go on a dog raising course.  This would prevent byb's, idiots who think a cute puppy is going to be a beautiful doggy, the ones who forget to train them at all.....<br>  <br>  I also think that people like the  former owner of my 8 year old Rescued Whippet want KILLING.  How anyone can boot a dogs ribs in, half starve it, race it until it can hardly walk & then over breed I do not know.  However with lots of TLC & attention Bella has recovered she is the most fantastic dog anyone could ever wish for.  I thank them for leaving her running around the streets for weeks on end because I now have a loving, loyal, snuggly dog who I will never get rid of & she is one less in the shelter, but their behaviour is appalling.|`|TRganQA4aa	Euthanasia should in the situations given not be an answer. I have a 13 year old Shepherd/Collie mix that is a dribbler but she checked out at the vet very well as far as her health. She still plays occasionally with my 2 younger dogs and she will roll on the carpet like a young pup sometimes, tail wagging happily so her quality of life is still very much there. If she was in pain and had a kidney issue then I would sadly consider it, but I can clean up after her. Plus if I had to - they do make diapers for dogs - but she is okay with her other bodily function.<br>  <br>  An easily correctable problem is not grounds either. In the case of the Border Collie - a knowledgeable dog person would know that Border Collies (as well as Australian Cattle Dogs) have a high drive to herd and even puppies will nip ankles. This is instinct but with training this could be corrected. Same thing with Coonhounds - I own 2 that I adopted - one because it was surrendered because he had no hunting drive (he lets butterflies land on his nose and sits there looking at them plus the pug next door bit him on the nose and now he is scared of her - if this gives you any idea) and the other was abandoned but I was told a lot of Coonhounds are surrendered also because of their howling. Which would be easily correctable with training as you don't even know I have Coonhounds except once in awhile they get going if they see something (and sometimes I cue them to howl as I like it) but I can get them to be quiet on command. <br>  <br>  I am aware of  many dogs being in shelters because of something that could be fixed and it angers and saddens me - I wish I could adopt more than I have now.|`|cnZlMojUaa	Is euthanasia the answer when an elderly dog becomes incontinent? No if incontinence is the only health issue.<br>  <br>  Or is it the answer when a dog kills a cat or rabbit? No.<br>  <br>  Is an easily correctable behavioral problem grounds for euthanizing a dog of any age, sex, or breed? No.<br>  <br>  How many Border Collies should be euthanized for nipping running children? Or terriers that chase/kill cats and rabbits. How many Pomeranians should be euthanized for barking incessantly, or Boxers for being eccentric? Answer to all the above, no.<br>  <br>  Anyone who is committing to bringing a dog family member into their home must research the breed. Border Collies herd and nip, therefore, not a good choice with small kids. Poms bark. Maybe not a good choice in an apartment complex with cranky neighbors. <br>  <br>  Dedicated behavioral training can help with issues like barking. Some behaviors are ingrained in the breed. These behaviors (herding in border collies, digging and chasing small prey in terriers) should be embraced, but by owners who understand the breed. Giving an appropriate outlet for certain behaviors (such as earthdog trials for terriers) can help eliminate inappropriate behaviors.<br>  <br>  It all boils down to uneducated owners who can't take time to research their breeds or do adequate training to make their dogs good citizens. Very frustrating. Don't euthanize the dog. The idiot owners on the other hand.....<br>  <br>  The one grey area in the questions you listed would be the incontinence issue. If the dog is in good health otherwise, then euthanasia isn't an option. If the incontinence is a result of a critical or terminal illness where the quality of life is gone, then I would consider it OK, but only with underlying additional issues. I have a 13 year old dog--he is deaf. This is not a reason to end his life.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	Euthanasia for behavioral problems should only be a last resort. Not for simple behavioral problems that can easily be fixed. Like and i know this may not be a good example but lots of pit bull terriers that have been fought there whole lives are way to aggressive to  rehabilitate unfortunately most of the owners of fighting pit bull terriers also make them people aggressive so that they will attack police officers who come near because of drugs. <br>  <br>  Border collies only bite children because of the idiot owners who don't realize that they have a high prey drive herding dog. And the dogs who kill a cat are also high prey driven dogs. I know any weimaraner would love to take a chunk out of a cat unless they were raised as them, and yes weimaraners are bird dogs but were originally other game animals including a big cat, they see cats as prey. I know my guys hate cats and would go after one in a heartbeat, but thats mainly because most people let there cats run free in my area. <br>  <br>  Euthanasia in those areas are not the answer. Instead euthanize the stupid owners, or so that it doesnt seem harsh take the dog away and re home simple.<br>  <br>  Euthanasia for health reasons is only necessary when the dogs quality of life is in question. If the dog is not going to have a happy life anymore there is no reason it should suffer. I had to put my old dalmatian down because of severe arthritis, hardest decision ever for my parents but in the end we could see that he wasn't having a good quality of life.
fgxajTiBaa	What a beautiful dog! She's got this big blocky head like a pitty and a fluffy coat how cute is that.<br>  <br>  She looks pretty big already so she's probably a mix of some giant breed. Do you know what the mother was? She looks like maybe a Husky/Shepherd/Saint Bernard mix. Hard to tell though. Maybe some Chow Chow in there too.<br>  <br>  Your mom is extremely responsible for making that deal with her. You're lucky to have such a great parent! Thanks for doing the right thing.|`|fEBOzWeXaa	there is definitely some shepard in her.

They are the only fluffy, thick coated breed that resembles that puppy that has a squirrel tail.

stMcVPCMaa	Jack Russells as a breed are known for having bizarre habits.  Mine does this weird thing where she walks around licking the air for half an hour after every meal.  I've never been able to understand why she does it, but it doesn't seem to bother her any so we've just learned to ignore it.<br>  <br>  Researching online, there's very little info on this kind of thing for any breed of dog.  The closest I could find was a disease that some breeds (particularly yorkies) are prone to, "Portosystemic shunt (abnormal blood flow to the liver)", where the lack of proper blood flow to the liver causes toxins to build up in the body.<br>  One of the signs of this disease are "changes in behavior after eating" or "abnormal behavior after eating".  What that actually means, we can only guess.<br>  Symptoms can include:<br>  <br>      * Abnormal behavior after eating<br>      * Pacing and aimless wandering<br>      * Pressing the head against the wall<br>      * Episodes of apparent blindness<br>      * Seizures<br>      * Poor weight gain<br>      * Stunted growth<br>      * Excessive sleeping and lethargy<br>      * Straining to urinate due to bladder stone formation<br>      * Patient with a shunt may have many clinical signs and some have only a single clinical sign<br>      * Some dogs do not show signs until they are older<br>  <br>  I wouldn't say that your dog has this disease, especially if the only weird thing he does is his leg chewing thing after he eats, but it might be worthwhile to talk to your vet and have a test or two run just to rule it out.  After reading all this, I'm certainly glad to know the other symptoms so I can keep an eye out for them for my dog!  Who knows, I might have a couple tests run on my little girl myself just for my own peace of mind.|`|AOOKr1K6aa	My puppy was constantly chewing her back legs. I took her to the vet to find out she had hookworms. They're about half an inch long and hard to see.. but they can enter through the skin and cause terrible itching and discomfort to a dog. They're also picked up very easily outside. That is only one possible thing out of many though.<br>  <br>  If it's always after eating.... maybe the food bothers him.
6AnuPGD9aa	from experience, its better to go to a company that works with wood with a design or even just measurements.. <br>  <br>  but failing that, an online site offering free postage, try to make sure the viv you go for is:<br>  <br>  a: water resistant. as most reptiles require moisture.<br>  <br>  b: and isn't made of materials such as pine (unless they have been treated to contain the harmful vapors)|`|KUKUYwOeaa	no
4SQx8smEaa	Cali Girl you are wrong Siberian Huskys are not HUGE...that would be the Alasken Malmute. They can reach 100 plus pounds, a siberian husky should only reach up to 60 lbs MAX.<br>  <br>  And neither breed can be strictly indoor pet because they were breed to work...and absolutly love the outdoors.<br>  <br>  Siberians yes are not the easiest to train, but they are not impossible, and they are extremely hyper...blaze is now 3 years old and is still HYPER HYPER HYPER!!<br>  They tend to run off a lot if they get off leash....and when they go they go...Siberian huskies were bred to RUN...they love to run and can run miles and miles a day.<br>  They need a lot of exercise, (at least 2 hours of vigorous excercise daily) <br>  A well exercised husky is a well behaved husky....if they do not get enough and are left alone...they become very bored and very destructive...trust me i have come home a few times with the Holy crap he **** on the wall look on my face....<br>  once I came home and he had my futon matteress shredded...there was fluff EVERYWHERE...he chewed the shoes...pooped in them...and some other things that i can not remember anymore....but that was when he was much much younger...he no longer chews anything apart...except for the occasional pieces of paper that he may happen to find laying around...<br>  O yes and huskies love to DIG...when the are bored they will dig...when they are happy they will dig...when they are sad...they will dig...ya get my point?? But i have managed to break him of that habit..<br>  <br>  Now do not get me wrong he is a wonderful dog now....but his puppy years where pretty stressful, and a lot of work...just as anyother puppy is. He has a very sweet disposition, and loves everyone!! <br>  Siberian huskies are by no means a good gaurd or watch dog...<br>  they are frienldy towards anyone...<br>  The only intention that a siberian husky has when they are running full force at you is to lick every inch of your exposed skin.<br>  <br>  My sibe is great with children and other animals...he loves the cats and the rats....<br>  Sibes do shed a lot...mainly 2 times a year when they "blow" their coat (same thing goes with the malamute, they both have a double coat) 2 times a year...the rest of the year their shedding is moderate.<br>  <br>  I do not know much about Alasken Malamute because I do not own one....what i told you was from my persoanl experience with my Sibe.<br>  <br>  <br>  Holy cow the thumbs down fairy must be on tonight!!|`|WU70UwEWaa	Siberian Husky: <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/siberianhusky.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/siberianhusk...</a><br>  <br>  Alaskan Malamute: <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/alaskanmalamute.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/alaskanmalam...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  I had a Siberian Husky.

They are pretty, but are NOT a pet-there are  serious working dog with extremly special needs. What happens when it cold for you NOT to have the heater in the Middle of winter, but the dog get TOO hot to tolerate the heater being on? These dogs are bred for the cold weather!<br>  <br>  Unless you specifically want a large dog for sledding, carting, weight-pulling, or other outdoor-related activities, preferably in a cold climate, I do not recommend this breed. Alaskan Malamutes were never intended to be simply pets. Trying to suppress their "hardwired" drive to work, without providing alternate outlets for their energy, can be difficult. <br>  '<br>  Frankly, most Alaskan Malamutes are "too much dog" for the average household. This is a serious working dog with tremendous strength. Very few people really have the knowledge, facilities, or skills necessary to manage this breed, or to provide the types of activities that keep him satisfied.<br>  Size 70-95pounds! Also 4km daily walks and loads of mental stimulation as well as 6feet+ fence.<br>  <a href="http://www.yourpurebredpuppy.com/reviews/alaskanmalamutes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.yourpurebredpuppy.com/reviews...</a><br>  <br>  Siberian Husky<br>  For experienced involved dog owners<br>  Size; 35-60pounds<br>  <br>  Who should own this breed?<br>  This fun loving, affectionate, outgoing, breed requires an experienced, committed, stable owner that has educated themselves well on this breed's needs. Siberian owners should be aware of this dog's amazing natural abilities and desires. They should also know that those abilities and desires, if not channeled and use will become a problem. The Siberian Husky attracts a lot of people because of it's beauty. They are also adorable puppies and win people's hearts in an instant. Many uneducated, puppy smitten owners soon find out this is not the breed for everyone. This is a fantastic, but very specialized breed that requires a special owner to be successful.<br>  <br>  Siberian Huskies are high energy. Always look to a dogs historical roots and modern jobs for insight. These dogs were originally bred to run in sub zero temperatures for long distances and still do. Their endurance and desire to go is not the correct match for the average pet owner. But for many Siberian owners, this breed becomes a lifelong passion of the heart and they would own no other.<br>  They need the company of other dogs or of people at all times. If you work all day, or have room for only one dog, don't get a Siberian. Loneliness for this breed equals TROUBLE. A lonely Siberian Husky will display a full spectrum of undesirable behaviors.<br>  <br>  Siberian Huskies have a pretty common trait for digging holes in backyards. If you take great pride in your landscaping efforts, a Siberian is not for you.<br>  <br>  While capable of strong affection for his family, the Siberian Husky is also very friendly with strangers and make poor watch dogs. A Siberian will not alert his owner to strangers. They are usually pretty happy to see just about everyone. Which I see as a positive for the Siberian. An owner is not bothered with irritating barking every time someone enters or passes by his property.<br>  <br>  The breed in general is not good with: Cats or any small animals, rodents, birds or fowl, because of their prey drive instinct. There are of course exceptions, but don't count on it. If you desire to have or currently own such pets do not get a Siberian Husky.<br>  <br>  Siberian Huskies are vocal. They rarely bark, but will whine, or moan, and also chirp and howl. Head held high, they will produce one of the most haunting song like sounds. Now this Siberian song fest may be music to the ears of a Siberian and the Siberian Husky fancier, but the neighborhood may not agree.<br>  <br>  Siberian Huskies shed a lot. When they blow coat in the spring it is a lot like a doggie hair storm. Brushing helps and you can speed the shedding up with a warm bath. But if you don't like fur all over the house, the car, the furniture and if you don't want to match you wardrobe to you dogs coat color, you don't want to get a Siberian.<br>  <br>  Siberian Huskies need a lot of exercise. They have a high endurance level and need a owner that wants to keep up with them. Huskies love to do what they were bred for, so being involved in Siberian Husky sledding, carting and other events or breed clubs is a plus for the dog and the owner. Obedience and agility are also good outlets and activities for the Siberian Husky and owner. They can make good walking/running partners, if the weather is not to warm.They need 2 long walks totalling a minimum of 4km plus loads of mental stimulation!<br>  <br>  Siberian Huskies have a tremendous desire to RUN. But the very first dash that a puppy makes could be it's last. These dogs should never be allowed to run at large. They face too many hazards in today's world: Cars, other dogs, guns, poison, antifreeze. In addition, they can come in contact with diseases: Parvo, distemper, corona, parasites. The clever Siberian Husky can surely add to that list, easily. They also have a strong prey drive. A gentle family Siberian Husky, at large can inflict, death or injury to livestock, fowl, cats, and wildlife. These mis-adventures could cost you some time in court , large sums of money and ultimately cost your dog, it's life. A Siberian, for their own protection, should be kept confined or under control at all times.<br>  <br>  Siberians are escape artists. Some can be contained in 6 foot fencing. Others can clear an 8 foot fence like they have wings. Most Siberian Huskies require completely enclosed kennels to keep them where they are safe when they are not being supervised. Each Siberian Husky varies, but in general this breed is a lot of work to contain. The Siberian is the "Houdini escape artist" of the dog world.<br>  <br>  Unless you specifically want an athletic dog for sledding, carting, backpacking, or other outdoor-related activities, preferably in a cool climate, I do not recommend this breed. Siberian Huskies were never intended to be simply pets. Trying to suppress their "hardwired" drive to work, without providing alternate outlets for their energy, can be difficult.<br>  <br>  To keep your Siberian Husky in, and to keep other animals out, fences should be high, with wire sunk into the ground along the fence line to thwart digging. Gates should have the highest quality locks. Many Siberian Huskies are clever escape artists who will go over, under, or through fences in search of adventure<br>  <a href="http://www.yourpurebredpuppy.com/reviews/siberianhuskies.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.yourpurebredpuppy.com/reviews...</a>|`|n7GOiKC0aa	Malamute is bigger than Husky but Husky is more affectionate with family than Malamute.

If he persues it he has to PROVE it was your dog.  You don't have to prove it wasn't.

Then it will cost him more than fifty bucks in lawyer fees.|`|EdjQnGpyaa	I really don't want to be rude but where the hell do you people come from? It's because of people like you, and apparently some of your neighbors, that wonderful dogs bred for specific jobs with sharper-honed instincts, have bad reps and are put to sleep every day.  Let me give you a real quick lesson on pit bulls, poodles and ALL dogs.  They are predators and pack animals by instinct.  If they are allowed to roam freely and congregate they become predators! In this situation, the meekest dog will become agressive, not unlike human "gang members".  Some dogs, purebred or mixed, are "working breeds" intended for protection, hunting or herding with a more "aggressive" instinct which enables them to do what they were bred to do. Unfortunately, when these poor intelligent, brave souls are taken out of their intended eliment and placed with fools, these mental, and physical, instincts are vented through other means. When allowed to form a pack and prowl, more often than not, it will be at the detriment of a helpless victim be it a cat, dog, adult or child. So whether your dog "thinks he is a poodle" or Dolly Parton while at home, he thinks he's Conan The Barbarian when he's hangin' with his homies.  I would say chances are pretty good that it was both Conan and Kujo from next door that attacked that poor man's little dog.   But that is only my opinion.  In answer to your question "Civily, do I have to give him $50?". Hell no!  Your "civic" duty as this man's neighbor was to keep your dog contained on your property, if only to prevent him from crapping on his lawn.  (Your wanna-be poodle does poo doesn't he or are you also confident that he is void of the instinct to leave his "calling card"?) Leash laws are implemented because irresponsible pet-owners don't have the God-given decency to keep their pets at bay. The fact that you can't prove your dog didn't take part in this bloodbath, which you can rest assured it was, may make you feel "morally" inclined to give the guy $50 because you can't prove he didn't.  A pekingnese against a pit bull would not get the chance to leave many marks.  But then again, the guy is "kind of scummy" and "looks" like a criminal, that "may" have killed the neighbor's dog.  I'm sure that low-life scum only wants the $50 to buy a bottle of Jack Daniels, get pissed and try to numb the memory of his "mutt" being mutilated and the guilt because he was unable to protect him. I bet real estate is real cheap in your neighborhood.  I only pray, for your neighbors' sake, that you're more responsible parents than you are dog owners.  GIVE THE MAN THE MEASLEY 50 BUCKS AND KEEP YOUR DOG SAFE AT HOME!  Due to your irresponsibility you can't prove your dog's innocense and believe me, left to his own devices, he IS capable. You may saving him from the same fate as your neighbor's dog, whether it was being hit by a car  or at the hands of somebody who feels the need to show you how it feels.  Then spend another$35 on a dog-owners handbook and rent "Seven Years in Tibet"...it's all about an arrogant, self-righteous man unable to accept responsibilty and how he learned humility.  Sorry!  You did say you wanted feedback...right?|`|P4yttgPoaa	you dont have to pay the man anything because he needs proof that your dog did it and you can ask probably ask the vet if he brought the dog. you can also check for signs if your dog has been in a fight because most dogs would defend themselves so there should be something to see if it has bben in a fight|`|qapJU3tMaa	Leash law, or not, why are you allowing your dog to roam the streets?  It's just a matter of time before your dog is hit and killed by a car, or seriously injured.  Then you will know what a LARGE vet bill is.  You CANNOT judge a person by their looks.

m1ypmbNKaa	Birds Pick when they eat,your bird prefer bad food instead of healthier food.Like you rather choosing a Hamburger instead of broccoli or salad.Same with those birds you should just feed it pellets it will keep the bird much more healthier and more vitamins.Your bird unfortunately will have to eat when it is hungry.So it will eat there pellets.They are pooping red because its maybe the color of the pellets which cause the bird to poop in that color.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	Birds are really picky eaters and they don't adjust quickly to a change in diet.<br>  <br>  A 100% seed diet isn't healthy for the bird, but they will eat only seeds if they can get away with it.  It's like a person eating nothing but popcorn.  Don't give cockatiels sunflower seeds because it makes them mean.<br>  <br>  There are pellets that come without coloring.  All the ones with colors cause dyed droppings, and they can stain.<br>  <br>  The best way to change foods is to mix in a little bit of the new food in with the old kind, and then each day make it slightly more new food and slightly less old food, until they are changed over.  When the birds get hungry enough, they'll eat.<br>  <br>  You can also offer things like whole-grain bread, corn, and baked potato.  Our cockatiels loved fresh parsley, steamed cauliflower, and broccoli, both cooked and raw.|`|pYF9KnNeaa	V1ragO has given you good information with two exceptions.  Sunflower seeds do not make them mean.  But they are very high in fat and should only be given as an occasional treat, or as a reward when training.  Rule of thumb for Tiels is about 3-4 seeds per day, per birds.  Also, it is not true that when they get hungry enough, they will eat.  Do not count on that.  For the most part, a bird cannot be "starved" into eating healthy foods.  Some will starve before they will give in.  Use the gradual replacement method as suggested but make sure they are eating.  Any time we make a diet change, we must keep track of their weight.  You should get the weight before beginning the change and weigh at least every other day until you know they have accepted the new diet.  If you don't have one, you need a scale that weighs in grams.  Any thing else is not accurate enough for small birds.  You can use the same kind dieters use to weigh their portions.  Mine came from WalMart and I only paid about $20 for it.  If you buy one that says "bird" scale, they go as high as $80 or more and that's crazy.  It it weighs in grams, that's all you need.

They swim to the top for oxygen.  The also are top feeders and will never eat any food on the middle or bottom of the tanks.  These are the best and easiest fish to keep.  And they live a long time.  I have 3 of them in vases and I love them.  I change the water every 2 weeks and feed every other day 5-6 pellets and they are healthy and great.|`|Rdpv91NTaa	you should have both and get aleast 5 gallon for a betta it will make him feel better with an air pump and filter|`|vp0WdER8aa	heck yeah!|`|dJs2s9pfaa	Bettas do not need an air pump whatsoever. They have a labyrinth lung that allows them to get oxygen by breathing air. For that reason you should not over fill your tank with water as they will literally drown. Filters are not necessary either BUT it helps keep your tank cycled and free of waste. Too much waste will produce ammonia and will certain kill your fish.

Situations where hedgehog babies should be hand fed include mom neglecting or hurting the babies, or the mother becoming sick and not being able to care for the babies. I've had a few people ask about whether or not they should maybe hand feed their hedgie babies to improve socialization, but I haven't seen any evidence that hand fed babies are any better or worse socialized than mom-raised babies, and I have seen that hand feeding hedgie babies is a risky endeavor, at best. Many hand fed babies do not survive, despite the best efforts of the caretaker, so it's my opinion that it shouldn't be attempted unless there is no available foster mother and the babies would otherwise not have any chance to survive. That said, here's a list of some of the things we have found helpful when hand feeding:<br>  <br>  Cage:<br>  <br>  We place the baby in a box (shoebox sized) with soft cloth for bedding. A heating pad on low is placed under half of the box, so that the baby can get closer or further from it as needed. It is very important to have the extra heat source, since baby animals can't make their own heat.<br>  <br>  Food:<br>  <br>  We have used either kitten milk replacer (kmr) or goat's milk, both have worked equally well. We typically mix the kmr using chamomile tea to aid in digestion. I have heard of others using lactaid (the people product) successfully, too.<br>  <br>  Administering the food:<br>  <br>  A small tuberculin syringe is usually the easiest way to feed the baby. An eyedropper can work, but the syringe allows more control over the rate the milk comes out at. You can get one from your veterinarian, at a farm supply store, or ask at a people pharmacy for a "tuberculin syringe without the needle." I will usually hold the baby in my left hand (I'm right handed) so that the face is sticking out over my thumb and the body is enclosed in my hand. I put the syringe to the baby's lips and let just a little bit out. If the baby does not start to suckle, I gently use the syringe to open the baby's mouth and let a few drops at a time go in, giving baby time to swallow before giving more.<br>  <br>  How much food to give:<br>  <br>  It seems like the babies have very different amounts that they want or will accept. Remember that tiny babies have tiny tummies, and overfeeding will be just as fatal as underfeeding. Usually I will try to make sure they get at least 2 to 3 mouth fulls per feeding, and I start young babies out on feeding every two hours, or more often if they start squeaking. As they get older, they will be able to eat more and will be able to have their feeding times further apart.<br>  <br>  Stimulating the digestive system:<br>  <br>  This is VERY important. Moms usually lick their babies' bellies to help get the digestive tract going. We have to simulate this by rubbing gently from chin to rectum with something like a damp q-tip or cotton ball. There isn't any "magic number" of times, I usually just make sure to do about 20 to 30 strokes after each feeding, and that seems to have worked out fine. You'll know the baby's digestive system isn't working well if the belly becomes blackened in color and/or hard.<br>  <br>  The baby's poop is bright green, what's wrong?<br>  <br>  Most likely, nothing is wrong. When you give hedgie babies anything other than mom's milk, they get green stools (and sometimes it's really, shockingly bright). As they get weaned on to hard foods, the stools will become a more normal color.<br>  <br>  How do I start weaning them?<br>  <br>  At about 3 weeks old, the babies will start to get teeth. At this time, I provide some ground up dry food that's been moistened with warm water in a low jar lid so they have the opportunity to feed themselves between hand feedings. They may anoint with it at first, but keep offering it. Once they are eating the moistened food, you can then switch to ground up dry, and then whole dry (by about 5 to 6 weeks, they should be able to handle adult food). When the babies are about 3 weeks old, I'll often start adding a little bit of meat-based baby food to the formula to add some variety and some solids to the diet, and may put some in the dish with the moistened food. If the baby doesn't seem to be gaining weight, a high calorie nutritional supplement like nutri-cal or dyne can be added to the formula
2l4pDvwwaa	While it may be safe it would be far from appetizing if you knew what was in it. By products include ground chicken skin & fat, feathers, beaks, internal organs & other goopy stuff.

Remember reptiles are cold-blooded, which means they require an external source of heat such as the sun, or in captivity a 'bulb' to keep them warm and healthy. Mercury vapor bulbs are very powerful and give out a lot of heat and uvb so they are perfect for all reptiles. You definitely need the bulb. it usually costs $50-$70, and you also need to get the actual lamp, make sure it is a large dome lamp, obviously one made for high temperatures such as: <a href="http://reptilekeeping.net/catalog/images/zoomed/deep_clamp_lamp.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://reptilekeeping.net/catalog/images...</a><br>  DIET: <a href="http://www.boxturtlesite.info/diet.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.boxturtlesite.info/diet.html</a><br>  GENERAL CARE: <a href="http://www.turtlepuddle.org/american/boxcare.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.turtlepuddle.org/american/box...</a><br>  ATP CARE: <a href="http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/Care/cs-easternboxie.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/Care/cs...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  After you have read all this you STILL need to think about if you are ready for the LIFE TIME COMMITMENT it requires in owning a box turtle.

I know you're probably excited about the prospect of kittens, but your best option is to have her spayed. Cats can be safely spayed right up until the moment of birth.

eMloBoiXaa	Well guinea pigs usually will give birth after about two months. Seeing them move like that is normal.

Certainly don't worry about how much kicking, it can actually be a very good sign. That goes for any species really. Your moms not worried cause she probably remembers being pregnant with you and watching the lump in her belly roll from side to side and kick and punch her like you were hoping to find a way out through the belly button. the pig has more than one of those little soccer players all smooshed into a tiny space so it will probably look like a party going in inside to she finally gives birth. :D|`|wsLngQ8oaa	No matter what mammal, pregnancy is going to be uncomfortable.

2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	Okay, first of all, ferrets aren't nocturnal, they're crepsecular (come out at dawn [until about 12] and then at dusk [until full dark], if kept to their natural schedule).<br>  <br>  At only nine weeks old, he's just little baby.  They will want to sleep for a long while.  However, it's not uncommon for kits to have coccida (parasite--not a genetic defect like what Marshall's guarentees against).  So, it's best to just get him into a vet for an exam and stool float (this way parasites/earmites can be ruled out).<br>  <br>  Have you thought about softening the food for a bit?  Hard kibble just may be a little too much, right now, especially if he was put on it at too young of an age (common in petstores).  Softening it will allow him to eat more and get more nutrients, without straining his body.  Just two things: offer fresh often (wet kibble can spoil quickly), and you may want to think about changing his food (if he's still on Marshall's) to something better--Marshall's is one of the worst diets for ferrets (too high in fish and plant matter).  Here's a chart: <a href="http://www.mdferretpaws.org/care/food_treats.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mdferretpaws.org/care/food_tr...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|bepZupAfaa	ferrets sleep 18-20 hours a day. they 2-4 hours of out of cage supervised  time to be able to romp around and play. <br>  <br>  have you taken your ferret to the vet yet for his first check up? usually when you take you ferret to the vet for the first visit the vet will give it it's shots and de-worm it. could be that he is getting skinnier or seems like he is  is because he may have worms. this is quite normal in baby ferrets as like puppies they get them from their mothers milk.<br>  <br>  even though he was seen by petco's vet  he wasn't  vaccinated or treated for worms. they just check for a sick animal is all. like runny eyes, diarrhea,or pneumonia. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   hope this helps|`|339NqJ84aa	Don't worry. Thats what a ferret day is, especially when they are baby-baby kits at only 9weeks old. <br>  <br>  Adult ferrets sleep an average of 16-18 hrs a day and their digestive tract is fast, it take about 3 hours for the ferret kibble to be poo'd out.<br>  <br>  I suggest feeding Ferret food NOT cat/kitten food.|`|2WUKnRQyaa	I also bought a baby male ferret from petco, hes about 9 weeks old now. they do have a HUGE variety of medical problems i would call the vet or petstore and talk to them about it. the guy that sold us our ferret wasnt helpful at all, we asked what food he was on and he didnt know he said just grab a bag it will be fine, well it WASNT fine! he started pooping blood and couldnt use the bathroom, we took him back and they took him to the vet he had a really bad intestinal flare up, we get him back tuesday but he had to get treatment for it. you have to take them out and play with them, or they will sleep most of the day, they sleep about 17-19 hours a day. get him some toys for his cage. if hes losing weight he may not be getting the nutrition he needs, i read they can die in a matter of days without proper nutrition. our ferret (mozart) was small, but we've visited him at the pet store and OMG hes fat now lol so make sure hes on the right food and vitamins and what not. they have really good ferret sites if you google ferret care, or ferret information, they give you lots of helpful advice. good luck to you and your lil buddy!|`|ow9j6hdTaa	Ferrets are nocturnal.  Are you sure he isn't playing at night?<br>  <br>  He needs to see a vet, ferrets have a wide variety of medical conditions that can be very serious, also causing weight loss.  Thyroid problems, kidney problems, diabetes.  He could be from a non-reputable breeder.  Did you get him from a pet store? Was it in poor condition?  It could be a parasite, such as worms, if the condition in which he was kept was dirty.<br>  <br>  Please take him to a vet if you're truly concerned about his health.  Otherwise, expect his condition to get worse, possibly to a very sad ending.

Wal*Mart.<br>  -Leash & Collar - $3-8 - there is such a selection of collars all different prices, my dogs was only $3, and they have all different sized leashes, usually around $7-10 a piece. Found these at Wal*Mart.<br>  -Doggie Bed - There are dog beds online for anywhere from $20+<br>  There are dog beds at Wal*Mart too around the same pricing.<br>  -Toys - really, it's how much money you want to dish out here. Your dog should have some rawhide bones that are the appropriate size, and some puppy chews for teething. Balls, ropes, - you can spend a fortune on dog toys, or you can spend a little, it's all up to how much you want to spoil your pet. But, in the start, $10 would get you plenty.<br>  <br>  Total of Supplies = $50-60.00<br>  <br>  Then there are the vetting costs, which there are ways of getting around the HUGE expenses. Petco holds a vaccination clinic once a month in most areas where they give vaccinations for low costs by registered vets. They also do de-wormings, heartworm testing, and they sell discounted flea & tick medication, and heartworm medication.<br>  The website to see if there is a vaccination clinic in your area is: www.luvmypet.com<br>  <br>  Since she is a puppy there is a puppy package for $49.95 - which will give her all the shots she needs to be protected. They can also deworm her if you find out that she has worms. That costs about $15.<br>  <br>  So your TOTAL starting price for a large breed puppy (including healthcare) would be about $100.<br>  <br>  If you choose to get her spayed, which is a good idea b/c it cuts down on urinary tract infections, unwanted puppies, male dogs coming into your yard to be aggressive because they are attracted by her being in heat, and it also reduces her risks of female reproductive cancers. It adds longevity to her life & will keep her from straying behaviors. Your local SPCA can direct you to a clinic or a vet that does low-cost spay/neuter anywhere from free to usually $50-100. At the very worst, it costs $250 at the average vet.|`|AA11992723	the start should be a call to the vet to schedule a wellness exam. you know nothing about this puppy or a vaccine/deworming history? a vet needs to see her asap, as with any new dog, to check things out and make sure she is vaccinated so she is safe to go outside. the cost of the vet depends on your area. preventative care (vaccines, heartworm pill, wellness exams) is the most inexpensive and best!<br>  <br>  it's usually said for everything including possible emergencies, pet owners should be prepared to pay $2000 a year at least.<br>  <br>  anyway. your lab will probably need toys for the usual powerchewer dog. <a href="http://petedge.com" rel="nofollow">http://petedge.com</a> has inexpensive prices but planetdog.com has toys made for tough chewers.|`|PM23RDycaa	You are lucky your parents haven't made you take her back.

How old will you be in fifteen years? Does a dog fit into your plans for the next fifteen years?  <br>  <br>  That's why your folks are upset, because they know they are the ones who are going to be this dog's caretakers, for the rest of her life and long after you have left home.<br>  <br>  Surprise your folks. Get a job and start paying for this pooch.

Been dewormed? Had her vet check? These cost of these things vary on your location and vet. They NEED to be done.<br>  <br>  And she is a purebred Labrador Retriever if she is a 'chocolate/yellow lab mix!!!!!!'. Chocolate, yellow, and black are just colors of the breed. <br>  <br>  Depending on where you shop, items will cost different things. You will need grooming tools (Labradors shed a LOT!), shampoo, bowls, toys, treats, and if you want your Labrador to be a great dog and no devour everything in your house and get fat and lazy, get in to a sport like hunting. Labradors are bred for helping hunters by retrieving and tracking the bird the hunters tracked. So, see if there are any breed clubs or breeders near you that would be willing to let you come with them to hunt. At most pet stores, they sell bird wings, too. Buy a few. Then you can teach her to retrieve it to you. And, you will need to set some money aside to get her spayed at 4-6 months old. Labradors are very overpopulated and we certainly don't need anymore BYB, low-quality Labradors.<br>  <br>  Good luck, but keep in mind that puppies are very expensive, time-consuming, and hard work!|`|vouUQQzBaa	Can't really say, it all depends on the health of the pup and what she needs to have done <br>  <br>  Vet visit (depending on your area. Here in NYC visit alone is $50)<br>  <br>  Vaccination (she'll need all her boosters probably unless the guy can provide records. 4 sets of boosters plus 4 visits + deworming you are looking here in NY at about $500)<br>  <br>  Toys, Bowls and bed depends on your choices<br>  <br>  Spaying will come soon.

YQfEOeStaa	Please don't take a "breeder's" word on the dogs as Answer#1 stated. I work with a boxer rescue and we come across "breeders" all the time who should be thrown down a cliff for animal cruelty. To them their dogs are only a means of making a buck. Make sure you see where the dogs are and how they are raised. See the mom and dad... that will give you a better indication on whether they are reputable or not.<br>  <br>  On to your question. We have 2 boxers. Not only do they LOVE to run with us, we live somewhat out in the country and so we don't even have to run them on a leash. We have one boxer who cannot STAND to have someone go in front of him, so he always has to be in front. He is a year old.<br>  <br>  They also are great for taking on bike rides. We don't allow them to pull us, but they run along side us, and for this we DO use a leash. Boxers have SO much energy, they have one of the highest energy levels of all dogs out there, so whatever you do, please be sure to exercise your dog. A puppy can be trained, so if you want a puppy then don't let the age hold you back. It is a great way to leash train a puppy, too. <br>  <br>  But another option is to adopt from a boxer rescue organization. There are so many out there. I am fostering one boxer right now who loves to run... loves to play and be outdoors with me. <br>  <br>  Good luck and enjoy your dog!|`|C9djEwkfaa	i have two boxers and i tihnk they would be excellent jogging buddies.. like someone else said dont take them out when its really hot out ..but i think a mile would be a nice jog for them mine go out and run the backyard all the time ...and they love going for a walk ..|`|6SeWCfUfaa	A boxer is a great jogging buddy.  You don't want to take them jogging when it's 110 degrees out and 90% humidity, but they are very athletic dogs and love to exercise ... and be with their people.  What better way to do both than go jogging together?<br>  <br>  If you're going to get a jogging buddy, don't get a puppy.  The growth plates on the pup don't close till they're about a year old, so they can't really be a jogging partner until that time anyway.<br>  <br>  I would recommend, contacting a breeders and looking for a young adult.  Many times they'll hold back a few pups hoping one will be a good show dog and, not all dogs are so as breeders determine this, they will often times sell these great young dogs, that are already house/leash trained and might be .. you know, a little shorter than they'd hoped or have an ear off center or something.  Which makes them not a good show dog, but they still make great jogging partners and pets.  And breeders will be TOTALLY honest with you about if they think the dog they're going to sell you would be a good jogging partner or not.|`|n7GOiKC0aa	Boxer has a high energy level so they really need plenty of daily exercises.  Jogging is a good exercise.  Here's more info:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/boxer.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/boxer.html</a>
xYTagSIyaa	I went through this.  I had a lovely cat, and I loved her tonnes.  She went for surgery to keep having tumors removed and had chemotherapy.  On top of the surgery and the chemo, she developed diabetes, so we started testing her blood two times a day and giving her insulin shots.  It prolonged her life by maybe a year.  Her appetite was poor and bore it all, because she loved me so much.  It cost between 4-6,000.00 dollars and all though I loved every minute I had, I know it prolonged her suffering terribly.  Would I do it again?  Wow!<br>  It is hard.  I don't think, I would put another animal through that again.<br>  It caused so much pain and heartache and suffering and money.  <br>  <br>  If it helps, if I had a cat with cancer in the future I would make them as comfortable as possible, as cancer is somewhat painless and treat only for immediate problems that could be resolved, like in your case, if your cat could have its lungs drained and it would not come back, I would treat it, but if I would have to take her in every week to have things drained or sooner, I would wonder if it is causing too much suffering for an animal I loved so dearly.  <br>  <br>  It is my experience not just with the cat I mentioned above, but with a few others I have owned and loved that cats generally don't do well with chemo and or a lot of other medications.<br>  <br>  I also owned a cat with FIV he was given a series of pills to take.  He was such a good cat, he did not fight but took all his 8 pills a day without any problems.  After 1 month he collapsed and went into respiratory failure.  I had another cat with a low thyroid, she was put on thyroid pills, within 2 weeks she went into kidney failure.  I was giving this cat bags of fluid and needles every day to keep her alive.  This lasted a week before she ran into further problems and I decided enough and had her humanely put to sleep.<br>  <br>  I would in the future just make any cat I had as comfortable as possible and put them down when I relise they can no longer be comfortable.  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|TNOQk3Fjaa	Fluid in the chest of a cat is serious some even die drowning from the inside out. Usually though that isnt cancer its luekemia or aids. <br>  Treatments if you have been told it is indeed cancer cost alot of money and your better off calling around.<br>  As for helping the cat it more just buys your cat a few months more in time to live. They can drain the fluid from the chest but I am sorry to say the only way to help your friend is to end her suffering.

Irresponsible breeding is the leading cause of piggies being without loving homes and/or worse. If you don't know what you are doing you could put your pigs in danger of death from birth complications. Make sure you do the right thing by putting them in separate cages or getting two of the same sex. If you must get a male and female and keep them in the same cage, get the male neutered before you place them together.

uJrG1jldaa	I don't think so. In my case I have a female cat that was spayed and she still sprays occasionally.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	in some cases yes and others no depends on the cat best to clean any areas with some "natures miracle" it minizes the smell of urine in the carpets and may stop the cat from marking|`|uctxzjIIaa	Normally yes. Though you will occasioanlly run into a cat who even after it has too much tesstosterone and needs cat estrogen pills to stop marking their territory.|`|LpgbD3WFaa	I agree with both answers.  What you need to do to ensure that your pet doesn't start urinating once it has been neutered is clean all areas in the house that it has sprayed.  You can do this by coating the area where he has sprayed with a vinegar/water mix 1/2 and 1/2.  Let it sit on the area for a while and then soak it up with a towel.  I would repeat as much as necessary. You will want to do this while your pet is at the vet getting neutered so the areas that smell will be gone when he gets back.  This has helped me before in the past.  I have included a link that tells you about the vinegar and water, you have to scroll all the way down to see 'removal'.|`|YzhZCs3Naa	it really depends on how old he is. The older he is, the more likely he is to keep his bad habits. You really should neuter your cat as soon as possible to prevent him from displaying dominant habits. It helps in keeping your pet an a calm submissive state|`|RN1wGlWWaa	In most cases yes they will.  Depends on their age and how long they have been spraying.  And they will be less feisty as the hormones are not in their system.|`|UBxKqdPwaa	Some do and some don't.  One should never wait that long to have them neutered.

gQongGHUaa	you need at least 100 gallons for this setup.  and yes they will torture each other to death, even the big ones in a huge tank|`|AA10332192	Short answer: yes.<br>  <br>  Medium answer: Piranhas while not quite the blood thirsty monsters of the movies, are aggressive and have no problems eating one another and fighting to the death.  Small fish will be viewed as a snack.<br>  <br>  Long Answer: 10 piranhas need space.  You do not mention the size and nature of filtration of your tank, but 6 to 10 messy predators needs space and good filtration.  All in all, piranhas make lousy aquarium pets.  Yes, the are cool, an mysterious, but after you feed a few dozen goldfish, pick up the mess and o constant water changes, they are less fun.  I have seen more returned to the stores and dumped than I care to ever see.  Don't get more until until you are prepared to do justice to the 6 your currently have.|`|QrjjiOgTaa	yes. if the tank is too small they will eat others because they are "stressed" and if they are not well fed they will cannibalize. they will also wean out sick and injured piranhas|`|rQgW7EaLaa	yes|`|W5W29lP5aa	wow your killing them and i agree piranhas do need space the rule for piranhas is that one fish gets 75 gallon and 25 gallon for every other fish.and their cannonballs they will eat other in their tank.also their illegal in states that have warm water so southern states.i think you best keep the 6 you have|`|SOxdyWQOaa	yes they will eat each other and will eat the 1 inch ones too<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  18 years experience with fish|`|SZOMVGBRaa	Yes maybe if you don't feed them enough, that's where most people go wrong with Piranhas. They are not like other fish where you c an feed once a day or skip days and stuff. You NEED to feed them at LEAST twice a day every day 24/7 365<br>  <br>  If you fail to do this they will start to take bite out of each other. How big is Your tank ? Already for 6 Piranhas your gonna need a 125 gallon tank at least, buy 4 more and your looking at a 200 gallon. These fish get huge and if you cramp them too tight its the same result as not feeding enough. I would advise against this move. The fish you already have may eat them as soon as they hit the water as well, no guarantees they make it. <br>  <br>  Good Luck
6SeWCfUfaa	Well, neutering him is a good idea all the way around.  And I'd do it as soon as his testicles are dropped.  If they're down now, neuter.  If this vet of yours won't do it till 6 months, find a new vet.  <br>  <br>  Thought, I don't see a dominance battle with a 14 week old puppy.  What I do see is you confusing the matter by having puppy pads by the door.  That makes it ok to pee in the house.  I also see the puppy viewing using the bathroom in the house as an attention getter.  14 week old puppies typically do not mark.  That's something that normally starts close to 6-8 months when they're teenagers.<br>  <br>  Go back to basics with this pup.  Crate train and train the pup to only use the yard for his bathroom needs.|`|TNOQk3Fjaa	Take away any water left in his bowl after 9 p.m.<br>  My dog had accidents too and thats what her trainer reccomended. <br>  <br>  Also just as your vet said neuter your dog at 6 months it stops him from lifting his leg in the house.|`|9kTejB0uaa	Right.  For starters, I have to pick up on the castrate as soon as the testicles have dropped thing.  My Basset puppies bits were down at around 10 weeks, if not sooner.  NO WAY would I be castrating at that age!!!<br>  <br>  Moving on to what's going on here - this puppy is excited at 'dad' coming home and he's forgetting all the training you have done so far.  14 weeks is still way young for his house training to be solid.  It isn't always the case, but I believe this is what's going on here.  Do you have a crate?  What I recommend is using this - dogs don't normally pee or pooh in their 'beds' and you have to assume he's not going to do this.  After you bring him in, regardless of whether he's peed or not because males never completely empty when they go, put him in his crate.  Leave him for say 20 minutes.  You may need to put him out again when you let him out, but doing this will reinforce what you are trying to get him to do - hold it!!<br>  <br>  I truly don't see this as necessarily a dominance issue.  More a young puppy who needs an extension to his training.<br>  <br>  When your partner comes home, the tempo of the household picks up from the quiet peace of his life with you during the day.  A mistake is entirely understandable.<br>  <br>  And please don't get him castrated until he's over a year.  <br>  <br>  Vets - seeeeesh!!!!  (How many of them actually have a dog, never mind have trained a puppy?)|`|F89MNQheaa	I would go with what the vet suggested but of course that means waiting abit still, every time he pees in the house you could try waving a carrier bag or a bottle filled with rice, thats what that dog trainer woman off c4 did.He is stating his domain infront of your partner and if you are off as you are on maternity leave you need to do it fast as having a 14 week old pup and a baby isnt the best idea especially if it is peeing on the carpet.|`|FQmZLqMdaa	You need to put the dog out of the house for an hour so you can sterilize the carpets where he has done his business.  If he can smell where he has done it before he will keep sinning because he can get away with it.  You need to be very strict & every time he sins he needs to go outside for ten minutes, he will soon learn. He is only a baby but.....  As he grows up his bladder/bowel will get larger & he will be able to hole it longer.  If he does it in front of your partner then he should be the one to put him out.  He will be showing that he is master not the puppy. Getting him neutered may help with dominance issues but it will not resolve the problem totally.|`|QnJvJ67uaa	The dog we had when I was a kid was like that, mum said he was a real angel in the day but as soon as we came home from school he was a nightmare. Your puppy has your attention all day and the when your partner comes home your attention shifts so he tries ot get your attention ,good OR bad.<br>  Get your partner to take over some of the puppy responsibilities like walking and feeding, your pup needs to know his place. when your baby come he will see a small helpless rival for your affections. Make sure he is the lowest pack member, feed him last in the family, make sure he allows you to take food and toys from him without complaint, never let him on the sofa with you etc. and yes, get him neutered it will help a lot :) good luck x|`|YCmveH6laa	Neutering is god option, will stop the wee smell and his terrotorial markings.<br>  <br>  Another option is not to take him to get neutered and let him carry on pee around the house and let oyu guys get stressed out.|`|bbF5lqNPaa	get rid of your boyfriend|`|A5mgh8G2aa	he is marking his territory as your vet said its over dominance i had the same problem with my cat but in the opposite order he was really submissive and loving and affectionate to me (the male) but he would scratch/bite any female person trying to pet him he still does it now but you have to wind him up to cause it so that is understandable we had him neutered but i really dident notice a difference for a good 6 months so be aware that the changes take a long time|`|MKuDawP7aa	Follow these time-tested tips on housebreaking puppies for success. They work for all dog breeds.<br>  <br>  #1. Involve the whole family in house training your puppy. This helps socialize your puppy. It also makes it more likely that someone is available when your puppy needs attention. Children under ten years old will need supervision.<br>  <br>  #2. Make sure everyone follows the same training methods. Any variation will just confuse your puppy. For example, always use the same cue word for your puppy to associate with going to the toilet.<br>  <br>  #3. Give your new puppy the attention it deserves. Frequent accidents means you're not paying enough attention to your puppy.<br>  <br>  #4. Restrict your puppy to a small room in the house until house trained. It should have an easy to clean floor like linoleum. A baby gate is a good way to keep your puppy in the room. Have it's bed or crate in one corner, Water dish in another corner, and feed him in another corner. Make sure he has some chew toys<br>  <br>  #5. Don't punish your puppy after he has an accident. If you catch him in the act - interrupt him with a verbal rebuke and perhaps a clap of your hand.<br>  <br>  #6. Puppies tend to eliminate in the same spot again and again. They find this spot by smell. Deodorize thoroughly if there's been an accident. If he uses the spot again, you probably didn't use enough deodorizer product.<br>  <br>  #7. Reward your puppy when he eliminates in the correct place. Praise him during and immediately after the event. Use an enthusiastic tone. With repetition, your puppy will associate the correct behavior with the reward|`|Wa6pdoVfaa	I can help you out there! I had the exact same problem with my two dogs. <br>  I went to a pet behavioralist and a vet who informed me that a lot of dogs, perfectly normal dogs, have an automatic fear of males. They may not show it in their attitude towards the man but in subtle ways such as the problem ur experiencing. <br>  You are the one who has been around ur pup most since you have gotten him/her so he/she will not fear you. <br>  Some dogs develop an automatic fear of men. <br>  Let your partner feed it in the evening and make sure he is gentle and pets him/her often. A way to a dogs heart is food and love. The dog will not fear a person who gives them thos etwo basic needs. Basically, like a child needs routine, so does ur pup. He will know that u will feed him in the morning and ur partner in the evening, he needs to rely on both of you. <br>  It worked for my two! Hope this helps!
TjLCnxkKaa	Really you need a vet to make that kind of diagnosis, but just in case he does have it you need to take extra personal protections like wearing gloves and no mouth start siphoning as it can be transfered to humans.<br>  <br>   The curvature of the spine would place fish TB on the list of suspects. <br>  <br>  However, did this fish or do any of the others do a lot of scratching? It could be you have a fluke problem and this particular one has been overwhelmed.|`|dJs2s9pfaa	I don't think it TB. At least I've never heard of fish getting this in the aquaria. It more likely due to bacterial,viral or parasite. Try Lifeguard by Jungle Labs. It's a dissolving medicated tablet that treats everything I mentioned above. It's completely safe and non-antibiotic.
O1PpybX0aa	My dog is 4 years old now. I potty trained her by taking her outside often and rewarding her with a treat when she went. In a week she was begging to go outside just to get a treat. I had to watch her to make sure she was going and not just pretending to get a treat. Then I started to cut the treats down to where now she just gets a treat for the last time out for the night even though she will beg for them now and then.<br>  <br>  My dog is healthy and not overweight and the amount of treats she was given was minimal. In the beginning I would break a small biscuit in half and just give her half of the treat each time she did her business.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope this method works as weel and fast for your as it did for me.<br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://www.Best-Dog-Advice.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.Best-Dog-Advice.com</a>|`|PM23RDycaa	Well first off you shouldn't have listened to other people.

pYF9KnNeaa	It can be very difficult to know when a bird is ill because they will mask their symptoms for as long as possible.  It is an instinct because ill or injured birds are chased away from the group as it makes them more vulnerable to predators.  By the time we see symptoms, it's because the bird is too ill to keep up the pretense and it may be too late.  The best way is to really know your own bird's body language, and it's critical that you know what your bird's normal droppings look like.  Sometimes a change in the droppings will be our first hint of a problem.  Any change that lasts more than 24 hours and cannot be accounted for by diet, should be cause for alarm.  Now, for the two things you describe.  First, the beak grinding is a sign of a happy, content bird, usually just before they are ready to fall asleep.  The yawning is for the same reason we do it, usually.  However, they sometimes get a seed husk or something caught in their throat and they will make yawning motions to get rid of it.  If the yawning is occasional, don't worry about it.  If it gets to the point he is doing in constantly, and especially if he makes bobbing motions with his head as if he is trying to vomit, then you should have him checked out.  I hope that eases your mind.|`|o3nNm1iAaa	Hi!<br>  <br>  You just can't tell if birds are sick or not. Your cockatiel has teeth! Mine has no teeth at all. Just kidding. Did you mean your cockatiel grinds his beak? Just have your cockatiel checked by a vet. It's okay if your cockatiel yawns alot and grinds his "beak". He's probably just bored or something.|`|463xvavLaa	It doesn't sound like anything serious, my Senegal Parrot does the same things all the time. Unless you notice that your bird is not eating or drinking regularly, it is difficult to tell if they are sick. Make sure you have a cuttle bone in the cage for the bird to use, it helps grind down their beaks and keep them healthy and they're not expensive at all. Toys, although expensive, are essential to every bird cage, both to keep your bird occupied and to exercise them. <br>  If you notice anything severe however, like your bird plucking it's feathers out or sitting at the bottom of the cage unable to get up to it's perch, then definitely take it to a vet.

It could very well be from not rinsing your substrate thoroughly. Try replacing your filter or rinsing it out. If that doesn't clear up after 24 hours then do a 25% water change every day until it clears. Don't forget to still add your water conditioner as the chlorine and chloramines will kill some of your good bacteria.
463xvavLaa	If you can safely handle your bird then with the help of another person take your bird out of the cage, warp it in a clean, dry wash cloth. Make sure that one person is holding (gently, but firmly) onto the bird around the chest, to keep the wings down by the bird's sides, you don't want to crush the wings. Carefully, turn the bird onto it's back, make sure the feet are sticking out of the wash cloth and with a pair of nail clippers, trim the tip of the nail off. Don't cut it too far down, as you may cut the cuticle and like humans it will start to bleed. <br>  <br>  Usually the whole process is pretty hard on the bird, some that are not used to being handled get really aggressive and start biting and clawing at whomever is holding them. If you're at all uncomfortable with doing this, then take your bird to either a pet shop that specializes in birds or your vet should be able to handle it fairly easily.|`|iJtuhLMTaa	Yes you can safely trim your birds nails.

I honestly don't think any of the commercial brands are all that good for your hamsters so I have come to the conclusion that it is best to buy 3 of the more inexpensive brands and just feed your hamster a small teaspoon of each a day that way he will have a fun variety in his diet even if it is not the healthiest of diets! :O You ulet your kids eat mac and cheese, and gold fish don't you I mean it's not like you feed your hamster ice cream and gummy worms every meal!<br>  <br>  ToYS!! / items<br>  One LARGE SOLID plastic wheel - $4-$5<br>  A den/house $3-5<br>  A water bottle $5-$8<br>  Tube attachments - may come with or be a set of like $10<br>  you can add extra houses and fun things to chew on and climb over by chopping up your UPS or Fresh Direct boxes ... ((i.e. WHY SPEND $14 ON "WOODEN HUTCHES" or "CARDBOARD FLUFF TUBES" WHEN YOU CAN MAKE IT OUT OF CARDBOARD FOR A MORE DISPOSABLE, INEXPENSIVE AND CLEAN OPTION))<br>  <br>  Be prepared to if the occasion arises take your hamster to the vet!! It is your duty as a pet owner and be prepared to spend anywhere from $20-$200 and don't complain I spent $2000 on my hamster plus another $2000 in ridiculous over the top supplies that i totally got ripped off on.<br>  <br>  And that's all!|`|KlDoKDEjaa	about $60 there not expensive.<br>  <br>  about 1- 3 years<br>  <br>  food water cage toys. running wheel<br>  <br>  maybe some tubes for the cage|`|EdN7fkTgaa	Hamster can live up to 3 years.Actually it depens on the type of breed.<br>  Dwarf hamsters can live up to 2-3 years<br>  Syrian hamsters can live up to 3-4 years<br>  Teddy bear hamster live uo to 2-3 years<br>  Sometimes all hamsters who get proper care can live up to 2-5 years.<br>  The things you will need for your hamster is:Small food dish <br>  Water bottle <br>  House - Hamsters need a hiding place where they can sleep and feel safe. This can also can be a little cardboard box. <br>  Wheel -they love to exercise on the wheel. When buying a wheel make sure you put paper in between the bars. (Hamsters can otherwise break their legs.) <br>  Bedding - Never use wood shavings (cedar or pine) for your hamster. They are toxic and can cause both respiratory and liver problems. Two most common and safe bleedings to use are Aspen and Carefresh. ( Anything made from recycled newspaper are safe too) <br>  Do not use the fluffy bedding that is sold in pet shops. There have been cases where hamsters have tried to stuff the fluffy bedding into their pouches and ended up choking on it. Solution: use non-scented tissue paper. Tear it apart in small pieces. <br>  Food - Pellets or Lab block diets such as Kaytee Rainbow Exact are much healthier for your Hamster. You can add small amounts of seeds to their diet for treats. <br>  Fruit/Veggies - You can give your Hamster small amounts of fruits and vegetables on a daily basis. <br>  Altogether it will cost only about $50-$70 if you buy a cheap cage at about $30<br>  Good Luck!<br>  Hope this helps!|`|wsLngQ8oaa	Hamsters generally live 1-2 years.<br>  <br>  They need a Cage, Shavings (aspen) a wheel, a food dish, and either a water bottle or dish (I used a dish because a wet hammy is a majorly bad thing) then food. The initial purchase is obviously the most expensive. Generally cages run about 30 bucks, a lot of the time a wheel comes with it. A bottle can run about 10 bucks, and dishes are about 4 each.

vgWqUcobaa	If this is her first litter and she is a timid mouse, I would leave her alone to get used to being a mom for at least a couple days.  TBH, there is little you can do to help newborn mice if mom isn't caring for them, so letting nature take it's course is really best.<br>  <br>  After she has had a day or two to herself, try to take a peek at the babies when she is out of the nest.  Maybe give her a special treat (I give my nursing mom rats and mice a little bit of egg as a treat to help them out) and while she is investigating that treat take a look.  <br>  <br>  After that first look, let mom's reaction be your guide.  If she moves the babies, trying to hide them, I would leave them for a couple more days. If she seems to be reluctant to go back to them too, you best leave them for a couple more days.  If she just settles in and cleans them after, she isn't as bothered by your presence so you can check on the babies a couple times a day.<br>  <br>  I try to handle the babies by the time they are two or three days old and even before that I talk to them quietly so they are familiar with my scent and voice.|`|c3e32230ba92f78494389ee453f26c8daa	whoever says mother will eat the babies after u touch them is retarded and has absolutely zero experience with such situations, you can handle them on the first day if u wanted too, the mother wont eat them period, i handle newborn mice several times at least once a day to check to see if there getting fed, dont worry, just keep food and water full.|`|pWsbbQ7eaa	Don't touch the little babies or else the mom will eat them! <br>  Um...try only lifting the house to check in maybe a day or so.

dJs2s9pfaa	MelaFix heals open wounds, ulcers, and damaged fins. For extreme cases, PimaFix can safely be used in conjunction with MelaFix. Those two combined regenerate tissue and heal wounds very quickly.<br>  <br>  It is widely available at your LFS,big pet store chains and even Walmart. Just make sure you quarantine the fish you are treating that will save you money on using less meds and help keep your fish safe from the other tank mates. I noticed tank mates prey on the sick and injured fish in tanks. Better safe than sorry=)|`|2E2hHlCgaa	you can add salt.. not the cooking salt tho.... and put some ick pellets or drops in it... just cuz she's sick and also... if you have any slime for their fins... put a drop of them in it.... the slime if usually for rotted fins... <br>  <br>  every time i add water to my fish tank.. (fancy guppies) i always put some salt.. ick drops.. and if i like.. i put some slime in but usually i dont cuz their pretty much healthy.........<br>  <br>  btway.. just watch out incase your guppie is weak and swims near the filter.. dont want him to get stuck on it and die...|`|W5W29lP5aa	salt water will kill it guppies are fresh water and will only live in fresh water as for the dot it's an open cut if you can but her into a ten gallon tank let her be alone add lots of plants in the tank.make sure to only feed her brine shrimp for a few days in the ten gallon as for the swimming issue try adding in fresh water salt if you notice any thing just ask and i'll help|`|h1zWBH4Uaa	yeah, that's definitely really bad. get her some medicated food which will help her regrow the scales... First I would do a water change and turn the temp in the tank up slowly to 86 F and keep it there for 2 weeks after the last spot is gone. Do you have a test kit? If you don't, its really important. Test for ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, GH, KH, pH and iron good luck!<br>  <br>  *addition* do use some melaFix. it is good, but don't get salt since they are freshwater.|`|UbSJPBuNaa	if anything you should try some melafix

ZA5QTj3Zaa	Family B should make extra care the cats don't get out while Family A is fixing up the house to try and avoid the problem.  They should also offer to clean up the pee as a sign of good faith.<br>  <br>  Despite the law, I think that is best to avoid people from getting mad and the cats having to pay (be being poisoned, etc.)|`|RN1wGlWWaa	IMO family B should be keeping their cats under supervision and in their yard/property and not allowing them to roam unsupervised.<br>  <br>  Family A is fixing the house and if it requires open doors, that's not an issue.  The issue is that Family B is not being considerate or responsible by letting the cats out to roam free.|`|IuYekkPVaa	It's never worth falling out with neighbours, so both parties need to find a compromise that keeps everyone (including the cats) happy.  <br>  <br>  Family B could either keep their cats indoors until the renovations next door have been completed, or they could install cat-proof fencing so that their cats can't go into next door's house.  To cat proof your garden you need to have a fence at least 6' high. Around that you put an overhang (1" chicken wire is good) which needs to extend by a minimum of 18". Through the edge of the chicken wire, you thread fine galvanised wire so the edge is taught, but the chicken wire itself is slack. If the cat runs up the fence and grabs onto the wire, it 'gives' a bit and the cat feels insecure and lets go.<br>  <br>  These links have more information and advice on fencing in the garden.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fabcats.org/owners/fencing/info.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fabcats.org/owners/fencing/in...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.woodycoon.com/html/cat-proof_fencing.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.woodycoon.com/html/cat-proof_...</a><br>  <br>  If your budget allows, there are ready made cat-proof fences which you can install.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.purrfectfence.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.purrfectfence.co.uk/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.catfencein.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.catfencein.com/</a><br>  <br>  However, if there are other cats in the neighbourhood then Family A need to buy themselves an ultrasonic deterrent to keep all of them away.

6AnuPGD9aa	are they dead, or frozen?<br>  <br>  it is important..|`|RkK673VHaa	in theory yes, in reality its unlikely most frogs feed by movement,<br>  <br>  also freeze dried crickets have a much lower nutritional value (just incase there freeze dried)|`|h6m94ydgaa	No and they probably would not eat them any way. Its not complicated to feed live crickets you dont even have to touch them. I have 4 green tree frogs and a cuban tree frog and my 4 year old son feeds them.
AA10412922	The same brand I switch over a week,different brand it takes 2-3 weeks|`|a29qiNkvaa	You should have no issue change the food! as long as its the same brand you are feeding now! Merrick made there food so you could change that flavor. I have a dog that has a very sensitive tummy and never had an issue when I changed the flavors.|`|zLfYcM1Eaa	You should still switch gradually.<br>  <br>  Although it is the same 'brand', the fact that it is a different flavor implies that the ingredient/composition may be a bit different. (for example: one  may be chicken and the other may be lamb for a protein source .... or one may use potato and the other may use rice as a carbohydrate).<br>  <br>  And, because of the 'different' food composition, a gradual switch may be necessary to may allow your pups stomach to acclimate to the change, a bit easier.  (Imagine if you only ate chicken and rice twice every day for an entire year ... and then one day you decided to switch to steak and potatoes.  I know that my tummy would be very upset!)<br>  <br>  Of course this also depends on the dog ... some dogs, do not have a sensitive stomach, while others do.  Some dogs can switch "cold turkey" while many others will have an upset stomach and wet-poop for weeks.  So, to be on the safe-side, you should switch gradually.<br>  <br>  You should even do a gradual switch when you go from puppy to adult food (Although the ingredients are the same ... the composition of the food is different... ie. different levels of protein/carbs/fiber etc.)|`|xqp28ETVaa	Due to the fact that the new food has a different set of ingredients - yes switch gradually. What agreed with your dog's tummy from the other ingredient formula may not suit him the same way. And yes, watch for stool changes, vomiting and newly developed skin conditions as these are sign of intestinal distress and allergic reaction.|`|UE4WbmtQaa	no changing flavor is fine. however if your dog's stools become messy or irratic then you might want to go to gradually switching it.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	ALWAYS switch gradually.  Even just changing flavors.|`|AA10206941	It depends on your dog.  But, yes it does apply. If you want to treat your dog every now and then,I inquired a recipe a week ago and my mini pin loves it.<br>  <br>  You have to get a small bowl of dry dog food, add 3 tsp of vanilla extract, 1/4th a cup of grape jelly,4 tsp of peanut butter, and 1 1/2 small dog buiscuts mashed up alot.(i use a hammer) mix it together and my dong loves it!|`|6fbceac9cf90144163110ddd1dbca2b6aa	No, changing flavour should be fine. But if you notice any change in stools or whatever, then change back and do it slowly. I'm sure it'll be fine though.
inST4SlAaa	give him a couple days and see if he changes back to his old self.  if not you probably have to take him back|`|olujacECaa	I'd just take him back to the vets...just to be sure.<br>  Cats try to hid their sickness, and I recently learned that the hard way =[<br>  <br>  When cats start to act strange, you're supposed to take them to the vets immediately.|`|YzhZCs3Naa	it's very hard to diagnose cats as they are experts at hiding their ailments, it's instinct. Have the vet do a fecal to check for parasites and a blood test would be recommended as well to check for more serious issues. FIV or renal failure should not be ruled out without tests being done.
UZYT8eMwaa	You need some sort of heat source to provide the 90F  basking area and 80F ambient temperature.   You will need a source of daytime UVb lighting.  You can provide heat through under tank heaters and specialty reptile heating platforms.  You can also provide a source of heat and a basking spot using a reptile daytime spot light,  infrared or ceramic heater emitter. Do not use a white light at night!

3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	Yes, should be fine.  Rams are peaceful cichlids, and do well in a community tank set up.  Rams will generally stay towards the bottom defending their territory(but not very aggressive), and tetras are pretty much mid to top dwellers.  The only thing that may stress them out is any bottom dwelling fish, like cory cats.  But, my rams had no problems with the cory cats in their tank.  Just make sure there's caves, rocks, plants for the ram to stake out it's territory.<br>  <br>  Rams top out at about 3 inches, depending on the species, so they are not going to eat any type of tetra.....<br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|SZOMVGBRaa	Yes, even Neon's will be too big and fast for him to eat. MAYBE once he grows to about his full 2.5 inch's he might go after really small ones but Neon's grow to 1.5 inch's themselves. Any bigger tetras like cardinals or glow lights are just fine though. I have rams right now with Serpae's, Cardinals and Glow lights so I know it works out just fine. The rams don't even notice them and they are a breeding pair too, so they have a reason to be aggressive but still, nothing. <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|dJs2s9pfaa	There are a ton of possible tank mates for Rams. Just make sure that they require the same water parameters as your Rams before choosing the fish. Cardinal Tetras, Rummy Nose,Cory cats for the bottom,any tetra that is peaceful and can be in a south american community setup will be fine=)|`|stMcVPCMaa	I have three full-grown bolivian rams right now in my tank with neons, rummy-nose, black-line tetras, cory cats, clown loaches, and angelfish.  Everyone gets along great as long as they all stay away from the little 9-square-inch territory each of the two males has staked out.  In fact the rams completely ignore anything smaller than they are like the tetras (unless they have babies, then they keep everyone out of their space).  They are are most aggressive with each other and even then their "aggression" is nothing more than dueling over the best part of the aquarium.  I think they're perfect in a community aquarium where you want a little different personality for a bit of variety amongst all the schools.|`|2E2hHlCgaa	i think the ram will be too aggressive... the tetra's might be lunch or dinner depending on the size....... what kind of tetras do you have..?? some matters.............

3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	You'd have to do it in a separate tank, that's the only way.  The parents and other fish will eat the eggs, and any fry that does manage to survive.  The marble method is how I've always read/heard as well.  The idea is the eggs slip down between the marbles, so the parents can't get to them to eat them.  Then when they're done spawning, remove the parents back to the main tank.  A basic 10 gallon set up would work fine.

It could be something simple like a gastric upset or could be something more serious like pancreatitis - which left untreated can be fatal.|`|Txr7g5xmaa	You should visit an animal Doctor.

SZOMVGBRaa	Ok well mollies and platys will be just like guppy's if not worse, because platys actually have the ability to change sex in a single sex tank and mate. Crazy huh.  Anyways stay away from guppy's mollies and platys, they are like the fisher price of fish keeping, something kids do for their first tank lol<br>  <br>  Here would be my stocking if I was looking for an easy care free tank. First off you need to cycle it out fully before you add the fish. These fish I'm gonna recommend are hardy and easy to keep BUT can't go threw a new tanks cycle. (the first month or so) <br>  <br>  1 Albino Bristol Nose Catfish (pleco)  - Stays small and eats algae VERY well. <br>  <br>  8 -10 Neon,Cardinal or Glow Light Tetras - good peaceful schools. <br>  <br>  You can throw a few cory in too if you like, they are meat eaters though so require a special diet, they don't eat algae.<br>  <br>  Stay away for ADF and Shrimp, they will be a waste of money. ADF are picky eater and need live or frozen live foods. Shrimp are hard to keep alive, but they are cheap so maybe give em a try. <br>  <br>  I would also add a dwarf gourami, they are active and cool looking. Make sure its the dwarf kind though because the regular or large breeds get to be just that. <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you, Hope your niece loves it :  )|`|SOxdyWQOaa	sounds good you may want to wait on the pleco since no algae will be in the tank yet at least a month unless you get wafers <br>  good fish to get<br>  neon's <br>  black skirt tetras<br>  male guppies 2<br>  sword tails<br>  rosy barbs <br>  rainbow sharks are nice to have <br>  <br>  <br>  18 years experience with fish|`|4b127bdc65641a05881903d7090f19c2aa	You'd need a 55 gallon tank to hold all of the fish you mentioned safely and comfortably.<br>  <br>  Corydoras catfish prefer to be in schools of six or more and that's too many of them for a 10-gallon tank.  The general rule to follow is no more than 1 inch of fish per gallon of water and 6 2-inch cories would be 12 inches.  I'd recommend otocinclus catfish instead.  They don't grow to more than 2 inches and they're happy in groups of three.<br>  <br>  Mollies can grow to 5 inches or more so you couldn't have more than two of them in a 10-gallon tank and you wouldn't want to put any other fish with them.  Mollies like some salt in the water and catfish don't so it's probably best not to keep them in the same tank.  I'd avoid the mollies because they'd be happier in a larger tank.<br>  <br>  Here are some possibilities for a 10-gallon tank.  Keep in mind that each line is enough fish for the tank.  I wouldn't combine any of these groupings with any of the others.<br>  <br>  5 or 6 neon tetras<br>  <br>  One betta and three otocinclus catfish<br>  <br>  Five platies (like mollies, they like a little salt in the water)<br>  <br>  Five male guppies, but be aware that they produce a lot of waste and require more maintenance.  I'd go with all males or all females so they won't reproduce.|`|gQongGHUaa	wowowwww hold on a ten gallon tank can have maybe 5 fish at the very most.  Your best bet is to get two neon tetras and another pair of barbs or tetras.  Nothing else will go in this tank, and if it does,  you will have a very overstocked tank on your hands.  in fact 4 fish is a little much.  considering a 20 gallon tank would be a lot more logical.  do a little research and you will find the same thing.<br>  good luck|`|1D8tMCYIaa	Well, first of all you and your niece need to know about the nitrogen cycle and cycling the tank before there are any fish in it will save them of being stressed out. <br>  <br>  Also, remember that a 10 gallon isn't very big. Many of the fish you have mentioned get big like plecos (16 inches) and mollies can get big as well.<br>  <br>  I suggest she stick with the fish that don't get very big. Most tetras need to be in schools or 6 or more. Platys need to be at a sex ratio of 2 females to every male so the female doesn't get harassed. <br>  <br>  Check out the site and read up on it. Ask as many questions as possible there or anywhere that people know what they are talking about.|`|asXq2cFDaa	Ok, so 30 gallon tank, nice size!<br>  make sure she researches how to properly cycle a fish tank, this is VERY important in the long term health of the fish.<br>  Here is how- <a href="http://www.cichlid-forum.com/articles/fishless_cycling.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.cichlid-forum.com/articles/fi...</a><br>  <br>  After it has been cycled, do weekly 25% water changes. <br>  Cory cats need to be in groups, so minimum 4, 6 would be better.<br>  Ghost shrimp would be great, they are very clean and add little waste, you could have 10 or more in there!<br>  Pleco, hhhmmm. You could get some otociunclus catfish. They stay around 1-2 inches and need to be kept in groups. If you want a larger sucker fish, get a bristlenose pleco. They get about 5 inches long and are very peaceful. No more than one as males will fight and if you get a male and a female, there is a high change they will breed!<br>  Albino frogs are actually African clawed frogs, they get quite big and will eat other fish. There are African dwarf frogs, but the tank is a little on the big side for them. They need smaller tanks so you can monitor how much they eat.<br>  If you get guppies, ONLY get males, 3 males would do good in that set up.<br>  Only add 3 fish per week after the tank is cycle, all at once it would overload the bio-load, cause an ammonia spike and kill the fish. :(<br>  Here is what I think a good stocking would be for the 30 gallon.<br>  5 cory cats.<br>  10 ghost shrimp<br>  1 bristlenose pleco OR 5 otocinclus catfish.<br>  3 guppies<br>  6 neon tetras.<br>  Make sure to add them 3 at a time over a few weeks period of time, and good luck with the tank!<br>  Also, here is a pic of an oto cat and a bristlenose pleco, do not get any other size pleco other than a bristlenose or rubber lip, as they oth stay small enough to live in a 30 gallon.<br>  Oto cats- <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Otocinclus_affinis.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co...</a><br>  Bristlenose pleco- <a href="http://flyxaquar.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/bristlenose-pleco.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://flyxaquar.files.wordpress.com/200...</a> (Note-as males get older, they will grow bristles on their face, here is a picture of an albino male with large bristles- <a href="http://okcaa.org/Photo/0711/BNPleco.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://okcaa.org/Photo/0711/BNPleco.jpg</a> )<br>  Rubber lip pleco- <a href="http://www.plantedtank.net/images/fish/bulldogpleco.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.plantedtank.net/images/fish/b...</a> <br>  good luck with your tank!<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:Mickey P, you are right, a dwarf gourami would look great in there!

With everything you listed up there, (excluding the frog), I would say you have room for 6 tetras. These are very tiny but they are schooling fish so get at least 6.|`|uGt4eJUyaa	For a 30 gallon tank those fish and more should be fine. for the sucker mouths get sucker mouth catfish, they are excellent algae eaters. I'd go w/ the platy's as they don't reproduce quite as fast as the others, plus they're pretty hardy. You can still get mollies or guppies just don't buy any females|`|tDP6ru3oaa	For a 10 gallon tank....I would say<br>  -3 guppies (2 girls, 1 boy.)<br>  -4 Neon tetra's<br>  -1 pleco or sucker fish for the walls.<br>  - and a 2-3 pepper corries.|`|prU72N2Vaa	Watch the plecos some can get huge.  Get three otos will work much better|`|W5W29lP5aa	plecos get to big mollies are okay if you keep like 2 i had a friend who keep two but their live bearers though  for my ten gallon i had like 3 female bettas and 6 ghost shrimps and one male betta i had lots of plastic and real plants.but i than got a 55 gallon tank if you want you can keep a tank of mollies.the rule is a 1 inch of fish per 1 gallon so add up your inches to ten gallon does she know how to cycle the tank?neon tetras need a long 20 gallon because their always on the move
nwMBfgcdaa	A little more info is needed.  Age for one.  <br>  Neutering does not affect being territorial, my alpha GSD is neutered and is very territiorial over the house and the car.  <br>  Also, I am the alpha and he is still territorial.  <br>  If someone comes in the house when I am not there to greet them, he takes over.  If I open the door and accept the person, he does not even bark.  He knows by how I greet them if they are ok.  <br>  Some dogs just aren't territorial.  Breed does not guarantee personality.|`|HKNbWjtOaa	he probably doesn't know where the boundaries are. go round the meadows with him telling of grazing land etc and how many sheep he must watch over|`|C1Cobi1taa	Some dogs just aren't, it happens.|`|psMZrXa7aa	You should be in charge of the dog (or pack leader to dogs).<br>  Therefore where you live is 'your' territory and it is your job to decide who is allowed in or not. Your dog will be there to back you up.|`|KuUx34hCaa	more details please is it a male or female & territorial over what need be for I can answer|`|3VO81VDSaa	why would you want it to be|`|PDoWjqFgaa	Exactly what do you mean by "not territorial"? I've had GSD's that would allow anyone to approach if I was around, but would go on defense if taken by surprise, or would be far more protective of my place if I wasn't around. These same dogs were wonderful with cats and other dogs that I allowed, but look out if a stray tried to intrude unannounced onto the property. I noticed my GSDs have been more likely to use their brain--which is why as an owner of one you need to do your best to properly train and socialize your dog. A young, well-socialized GSD may not appear to be territorial or protective, but as he  matures and builds confidence(through training!!!), it should be there.Oh--and my neutered, AKC Utility titled German Shepherd is probably still my most protective dog I've had---and through the years, I've had many.
AA11992723	the clicker is supposed to help the dog pinpoint the exact behavior/position you want. you click immediately when she is in the lay down position.<br>  <br>  you might do better to catch the behavior in the act. when she lays down on her own, say laydown, click, treat.|`|ywoKvBInaa	the way i trained my Pomeranian was have him sit them place the treat a little infront of him and if he didnt lay down i put my finger behind is front paws and pull them toward me making him lay down|`|2eJcaeOPaa	get her in a sit hold the treat in front of her nose and move it down in between her front paws say down and gently push her (*gently*) when she is down say down and "click" give her treat she will soon learn
71i6IjdZaa	Its only about $150 to get him fixed, save up or something hun:)<br>  xx|`|PM23RDycaa	No one is going to do it for free. Call your local shelter to see if they know of any low cost spay/neuter clinics. Also neutering WILL NOT fix these problems. Only consistent training will, so don't be surprised when his behavior will continue after being fixed.|`|rXMTdUg4aa	You never said you couldn't afford to get it done. Do you just not want to spend the money?<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  You haven't responded so I'm assuming your still not in a hurry to do it for whatever purpose. If you CANNOT afford neuter. Some animal shelters will do it for free or they will go based on your income. Call animal shelters in your area to get information. Neuters are not expensive... especially for a small dog like a chihuahua. It should cost you $200 MAX and that should include medications, vaccines if they are not up to date, and an E-collar (cone device they wear on their heads to keep from chewing sutures) if required. Neuter your dog and don't pass him off to someone because he goes potty in his crate. He loves you and is loyal to you... you should be the same for him and help him through his doggy problems.|`|AA11827582	I would try getting ahold of your local Animal Shelters and ask them, especially with the economy the way it is and the need for all animals to be fixed that might know of some where or even be able to do it for you<br>  <br>  I know my local shelters are working together to help the pet owners in our city with getting fixed and helping with alot of medical expenses because the economy is leaving people to have to put their pets into shelters or abandoned them all together and they don't want that|`|8bHuUJczaa	No there isnt. The only way you can get a dog fixed free, you have to adopt a brand new dog from the shelter. If u cant afford to get it done then give it up to someone who can|`|WNsjy5oFaa	if your in the uk and on benefits or low income there are animal charities such as blue cross or the pdsa that will neuter your pet at a much reduced or subsidised fee. <br>  if your elsewhere in the world maybe you could try local animal charities but i think its unlikely you'll get it done completely free|`|cDEWpfMPaa	No place is going to fix your dog for free, but you can get a spay/neuter voucher that will deduct about 50 dollars off the price, which helped me immensely. Sorry to say that I do not remember where I got the information, but I'm sure if you google it for your area, there should be some. The drawback is that you can only go to the clinics listed on the voucher, which is a lot, but mine wasn't listed. On the upside though, where I happened to go was a lot cheaper. So instead of paying about 150 dollars, I ended up paying only 60. It won't pay for it completely, but it does help.|`|AA10496389	You can call a local Vet. Office and ask for a reference on someone that can do it low priced, probably not free.  I'm  from Texas and my city has a free clinic every once awhile for FREE spaying and neutering. You can also call your local animal shelter for information. I say Kuddos for you at least  caring for your animal. So pay no attention to these morons that are telling you to surrender your animal. Why don't "they" take all the animals that people don't take care of according to "their" standards|`|C5YBD3F1aa	Nobody will do it for free, but you could probably find a low-cost spay/neuter clinic nearby. Depends on your area. I know about 20 miles from me there is one and they will neuter a male for $20, to spay a female it costs $30 and $45 if she is in heat.<br>  <br>  Type in 'low-cost spay/neuter clinic [your area here]' in the Google search bar, you might find one near you.|`|qapJU3tMaa	No one is going to fix your dog for free.

463xvavLaa	Tucking it's head under it's wing is perfectly normal, my parrot does this also when sleeping. Also you may notice it standing on one legs while the other is tucked up inside it's body-again normal. But as for the room temp, for birds usually, the warmer the better! If you're at all chilly in the house, then most likely so is your bird. If you're in an area that gets really cold weather you may want to invest in a small room heater or heat lamp for your bird so you don't run up your heating bills. <br>  75-80 degrees is usually pretty comfortable for most birds.|`|BbT2UH3Caa	Yes most likely it is cold. i dont think its scared cuz i have birds and they always sleep with their heads tucked in the wing. well kinda. well i suggest turning up the heat or getting one of those fur houses that prevent drafts and keeps ur bird warm. i have a blue one and both of my birds go in it. only problem is that they poop in there too... lmao|`|LmZQkLS0aa	Maybe you should get another lovebird.  I believe you always should have a mate for them types of birds.|`|pYF9KnNeaa	What is the temperature in the room where he sleeps?  Do you cover the cage?  Is he near any air vents?  What kind of perch does he sleep on.  More information will help me give you my best answers.
ebb288886a8d584fd5d6ddf1d6a43a7aaa	Why are you feeding them different foods?  If it's kitten food for the kitten and cat food for the cat, it would be ok to feed kitten food to the cat until the kitten grows up alittle more. Then feed them both cat food.  Kitten food is more nutritious and it won't hurt your cat at all. At 1 yr, he's hardly more than a kitten himself.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Put one in a room and don't let them eat each other's food.  I only keep kittens on kitten food for about 5 months, then change to adult.|`|eZDoQPg8aa	For a couple of days it won't matter if the kitten eats more of the other cats food and vice versa.  And truthfully, the kitten food won't hurt the 1 year old either.<br>  <br>  Just have the person who takes care of them put some of each out and they'll be fine but I bet they'll be happy to see you!|`|cYuWbvSKaa	Seperate the rooms the food dish is in, or have them eat at seperate times, and while one is eating, keep the other company and keep it occupied and play with the cat, and visa versa.|`|A7XV2K3Paa	I separate mine in different rooms when I am away.|`|f7E4FqVfaa	Have you tried feeding them in different rooms? I put my cats' food bowls in different places and that helps a lot.
dJs2s9pfaa	Oh so you have African Cichlids, my favorite! They need brackish water which is easy to do. Just add 1tbsp of aquarium salt per 5 gallons. They like Cichlid Pellet, freeze dried or frozen  blood worms,tubifex worms, krill (only as a treat.)<br>  <br>   Also get a lettuce clip and attach some romaine or cucumber once a week, that aides in digestion.   www.cichlid-forum is the best it has saved many of my cichlid's lives!<br>  <br>  You should have lots of hiding places such as, texas holey rock,lace rock and caves. Crushed coral is an excellent buffer for them if you don't already have it. They like hard ph.<br>  <br>  As far as forums go visit these: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cichlid-forum.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cichlid-forum.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.allcichlids.com/cichlid_forum_2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.allcichlids.com/cichlid_forum...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.malawimayhem.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.malawimayhem.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.africancichlidforum.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.africancichlidforum.com/</a>|`|SZOMVGBRaa	Well here's my local fish club I belong too, they are great with Cichlids advice and have a Profile section and breeding advice for them. <a href="http://www.gcca.net/fom/fom_article_archive.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.gcca.net/fom/fom_article_arch...</a> Just use the little bar on the left side to scroll threw the site, the page I gave you lists most of the real common cichlids. Most are the scientific names though, just google their common names and it will give you the Scientific ones. <br>  <br>  Also it depends how big the tank is and what kind and type and how many Cichlids you have. You can't breed more than one pair in a certain size tank because of how aggressive they become. Just E-mail me at mic6010@yahoo.com  if you have any questions about that. <br>  <br>  Give me a specific tank size and type of cichilds and chances are I can tell you how to best breed them. Use that site I gave you too, Great resource.|`|QrjjiOgTaa	what kind of cichlids? the diet, water chemistry, and breeding can differ from species to species.|`|3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	First, you need to figure out what types of cichlids they are.  Cichlids is a very broad term, then they're broken down into their area-African cichlids, South American, New World, etc. etc.  Then you have different species within that.  Breeding habits for the most part are the same, some prefer rocks, some caves to spawn in/on.  And, depending on the type, the ph and softness/hardness of the water can affect them breeding.  Just depends on the region/type of cichlid.  Figure out the type it is, then a quick search online will most likely produce a ton of results on the topic for that species.<br>  Good luck!

5PsKGss7aa	Im presuming how you are spelling chihuahua's you are from mexico possibly?Or you are maybe a troll? Well, never the less i'll answer it as I would if this was a real question..<br>  Anyway, they should not be leaving the mom till the minimum of 8 weeks.<br>  I highly suggest you get in touch with a vet as soon as you can.<br>  And when they get old enough,unless you can keep them, re home them for no more then I'd say, like $70 each maybe(Mostly just to cover the vet bills you will have for them).<br>  Later on, before the mom's next heat,get her spayed.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	Um your an idiot. You cant sell newborns its illegal. ChiHUAHUA's can not leave the mother for 12 weeks.<br>  <br>  um the person below me it Chihuahua not guagua or wuawua. <br>  <br>  And small breeds should leave no earlier then 12 weeks.|`|hQQuqyYcaa	First of all, wait until they are at least 8 weeks old to sell them. Also, if you have absolutely no papers, they're only worth about $50-$100. By the way, it's chiWuaWua....learn to spell if you're going to be trying to sell them. AND SPAY THAT FEMALE! We have enough dogs in this world as it is.|`|AA11244754	1) you can't even spell the kind of dog you have? that's just great no wonder you don't know how old they should be before trying to find new homes for them, (try using the spell check feature next time you try to spell the breed)<br>  2) you should've had homes lined up already IF the pregnancy was planned which is doubtful<br>  3) also you can't sell new born puppies since they MUST be with the mother for at the very mimimun 8 weeks! <br>  4) Also do something for yourself such as research it on the internet instead of being lazy and expecting us to do the work for you.  <br>  5) GET HER SPAYED (fixed) AFTER she's weaned them.|`|tY14vbrKaa	Chiguagua!

I know not such breed.<br>  <br>  I do know the chihuahua however.  How much do they cost? Depending where I would acquire the puppy from. Certainly not from a BYB.|`|pwiRMmicaa	dont sell them now!<br>  but they're pretty expensive like about a thousand dollars or more.<br>  but if they dont have shots or papers then you should sell them for at least 250 or 300|`|vITZgKthaa	about 5 dollars :]<br>  <br>  i got my dog for only 5 with an old dude

AA11887983	I would not feed him any more than 6 cups.  That is a pretty large amount of food, and should be plenty.  As for water,  he may not be that thirsty because he has been on iv fluids for support.  So you can offer it but don't force him to drink.  If he is eating, he will be drinking. <br>  <br>  I hope your dog gets well fast!|`|AA11244754	um, try reading the care instruction that you were given when you were paying the bill, if not do the next most logical thing...call and ask.<br>  <br>  this question should have never been posted.|`|vouUQQzBaa	Since he's eating normally and he dislikes water, have you tried to moisten the food? That way he won't get dehydrated either.<br>  <br>  They do need water, instead of syringe you might also want to try with a water bottle or settle a small bowl next to him, but DEF moisten the food.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Keep him on his normal feeding schedule.  Don't force too much fluid, what goes in, must come out and if he's too weak to drink on his own, he's too weak to walk to the bathroom that many times a day.|`|1TooRFX2aa	After my dog had surgery, i let her eat tons of ice. Ice helps hydration but isnt as exhausting as water.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!<br>  && im so glad ur dog is ok!!!|`|FQmZLqMdaa	No give him a little & when it is gone give him a little more.  <br>  Too much food all at once is not good for a sick dog.<br>  <br>  You should make sure he has lots of water available.<br>  If he won't drink it try giving him warm tea with a little milk & sugar, this will be something different that he probably has not had before with a sweet smell & because it is warm will help him improve quicker.  Tea is also good for giving them shiny healthy coats.<br>  <br>  If you are still having doubts or have lots of questions why don;t you phone the vet & seek his expert opinion. Good luck I hope the poor old lad gets better soon.

FkGh0LuWaa	Baby Mollies can hide very well and you may not see any others for a few more days.  Your Molly can have any where from 12-30 fry at a time.  Also for the next 4-5 months she will most likely be having  new fry every month.|`|asXq2cFDaa	ALL those fish will eat baby mollies. Chances are there are more than just one in there, but they are hiding.<br>  Provide lots of hiding places and feed finley crushed up flake foods.<br>  <br>  Edit:Depending on the size of your molly they can have from 20-200 fry. Since they are relatively new, I am also guessing they are around 2 inches?<br>  Probably 30-40 babies.

33PwXUblaa	Well, yeah that is fine but you could give him smaller meals more times a day and that will make it eat slower!<br>  <br>  Also, try making her do tricks for the food!<br>  My vet recomended it !<br>  <br>  What you are doing is perfectly fine!|`|aeXmMKRfaa	Make sure he doesnt have round worm, if not this is totally normal and he will get a belly ache, so feeding him one by one is ok|`|FQmZLqMdaa	You could try adding a little warm water or gravy to his food to soften it & slow him down.  I personally would not hand feed a puppy because if something happened to you or you go on holiday & leave the dog with someone else they would not take the time to hand feed & he would probably stress himself out & gobble it all down in one.|`|WNsjy5oFaa	do you mean you are hand feeding - this will make life harder for you in the long run as the dog will expect you to be feed him all the time. try feeding from a kong or scattering the kibble on the floor. you could also try putting a ball - large enough not to be swallowed in his bowl and that should slow him down as he will have to nudge and move the ball to get to his food. <br>  <br>  i have 2 dogs one was a fussy eater and i went through a stage of hand feeding when she was a pup as i was convinced she would strave to death if i didn't, my 2nd dog is greedy and i did all the above to slow him down and it worked<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|nwMBfgcdaa	You can put something (like a kong or ball) in the food bowl to slow him down.  He has to push it around to get at the food, slowing him down.  There are also special bowls you can by that have obstacles in them to slow down dogs.  You could also add a little water to the food, which is what I do.<br>  I don't know if one by one is a good idea, may take in too much air. <br>  Even spreading them on the floor may help.<br>  I don't know about little dogs, but my three are large breed that are prone to bloat.  One of the causes can be eating too fast so it is important they slow down.|`|AA11316609	Yes, you can do this.  Some dog trainers feed their dog's daily food allowance one at a time by making them work for it.  They give a piece of kibble for each time the dog obeys a command.  It definitely sends the message that you are the one who provides the food.<br>  <br>  If you get tired of this there is a dog food bowl you can buy which has raised bumps at the bottom.  The dog has to work around the bumps to get at the food slowing them down.|`|dWK0B5g3aa	It's fine, although I would suggest for a dog that eats to fast to put a rock in the middle of the food dish, sounds odd but the dog then has to eat around the rock and so it takes more time, it works as well.<br>  I know your dog is little but larger breeds prone to bloat are fed smaller meals and so I would recommend this too.<br>  If your happy with hand feeding then carry on, however the dog will ge used to it and so you could be doing this for around 12 years!|`|7WUvPI8maa	your puppy should be getting fed two times a day. our lab was the same way when we got him. eventually they grow out of it though he still eats his food semi-fast. feeding your puppy the pieces one by one is fine. its also a great bonding experience and you can use it to teach him more tricks. i sometimes do it with our lab who's now about 5 years old just to play and watch him chase after his food.|`|1TooRFX2aa	He's probably very excited... as puppies tend to be.<br>  I don't think feeding him like this is a good idea. I was doing that to my dog too cuz she didn't like the low-fat food. This habit makes your pet depend on you and may cause separation anxiety.<br>  <br>  Every dog is different, so i suggest asking your vet.|`|je09fnkaaa	you may want to put some big rocks in his food bowl to make him slow down, or you can get special bowls to make him eat slower. What your doing may cause your dog to be too dependent on you in the future.|`|LwV2vuOeaa	Maybe you aren't feeding him enough. Feed him what he's supposed to eat and if he chows it down that's fine.|`|pwiRMmicaa	what you are doing is great keep doing it until he sloes down his eating.|`|stMcVPCMaa	Eating too fast can be the beginnings of food aggression (one of the causes of food aggression can be fear that someone is going to take his food away from him).  The dog will eat as fast as possible so he can finish his food before it's taken away.<br>  <br>  Feeding him one piece at a time is probably not harmful in the short run, but it can cause problems in your relationship in the long term (he'll start to think you're his very own special food holder and might refuse to eat if you stop handing feed him).  And, if you think about doing this with him every day for the rest of his life, it can start to seem a bit tedious.<br>  <br>  With similar problems with my dogs, I've tried a couple of methods which worked well for me.  1. Put water in with his kibble, which makes it physically impossible to gulp his food unless he learns how to breathe water, or 2. put a tennis ball in with his food so he has to push it around with his nose to get to the kibble.  Having to push the ball out of the way constantly will slow him down.|`|Rm1u12mNaa	by all means you can carry on hand feeding but this will not stop him eating fast when you have to eventually return to feeding him normally. this is typical puppy behaviour. hw will eat faster if he thinks the food might be taken away from him or if another dog is around , try feeding him in a room and walk out whilst he is eating. this works for my greedy bboxer. it will not cause him any harm!!!!|`|JNFadzqfaa	this all depends on how much you feed him a day, <br>  typically though puppy's do eat fast. I have four dogs myself, and the Welsh Corgis especially eat fast, however feeding him the food one at a time wont change things much, just continue to feed him with the bowl.<br>  <br>  note: if this really worries you I woud consult a vet <br>  I need more info to fully answer the question e.i. are there other dogs, the info you did provide was helpful though.<br>  <br>  P.S. I love dogs too|`|AA11926268	Don't worry about the way he eats. If you feed him this way, what happens when you  have to leave him with someone else? He will not eat. Let him eat fast . My golden finishes her food in 30 seconds. She is 8 years old and very healthy.|`|Iwdrsvpvaa	There are specific bowls to slow your dogs eating, they should help.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://handicappedpets.biz/xcart/eat-slow-dog-food-bowl.html" rel="nofollow">http://handicappedpets.biz/xcart/eat-slo...</a>|`|Qk0RNenmaa	Putting a tennis ball in his food is a good idea. It's good that you are trying to keep him from eating his food too fast, it can cause digestion problems.|`|cfe02e6ae5ad9f610e0881cb2edcb2cfaa	I think this is great.

But you also want him to be able to eat on his own. There is a great product out there for dogs that eat to quickly, inhaling their food can cause alot of problems and possibly bloat (usually in larger breeds) I will post the sit for this dog dish that helps slow down the eating for you dog.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/brake-fast-bowl" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/brake-fast-bowl</a>|`|hKVOw1Sjaa	Do NOT do this and the reason l am saying this is although you have the BEST of intentions and love your dog you will create a dog that will expect you to hand feed all his life,believe me l have had the odd puppy owner come to me with this issue when they are a 2yr old and say why does the dog not eat by himself?<br>   If you did not get a diet sheet from the person you bought your pup from l am not impressed at all as you deserve to have that.At this age the pup still needs 3 small meals a day and if you are at school you will have to somehow organize that pup is fed OR leave a litle dry food out during the day but l do not advocate this either.<br>  A puppy needs an all round diet not jjust dry food as it does not give the pup the proper nutriirion he neads.Try and vary your diet with some raw beef mince l am not talking of top quality here.Pups need bones also not cooked but raw so get some chicken necks and chicken wings or veal shanks but if you give raw chicken necks hold one end so he does not gobble it and not chew.l hate canned food of any description but if you cannot get fresh meat try a really good brand of canned food,Your pup also needs aome non-lactose milk still as this gives  him calcium which he needs for growing bones.Every dog needs a little fat in their diet  that is the chicken wings (raw)If you need a diet sheet contact me and will forward to you one for puppies.<br>     You see people do not realize a puppy needs so much good nutrition  and variety.Think of it this way if you were served the same thing every night would you be happy?l do not hink so although a dog is not a human it deserves a good diet.You can even give your puppy left over vegetables with the canned food or an egg yolk twice a week and the coat witll gleam.<br>  Perhaps this is not what you want to hear but l can assure you do not hand feed.<br>  The other issue is have you wormed the puppy as it needed to be wormed from the tiime it was 2 weeks of age and every 2 weeks after that till 12 weeks o check on this issue.<br>   Why dont you contact  the shitzu club in your are for help and if in the US go to the AKC website and you will find it if elsewhere check your country's controlling dog body.Good luck and stop babying this puppy or you will live to regret it,OKAY!Just read your last added detail whhich was not there with the question.When you give added tthings mix it in so well that he cannot turf it out.On efurther thing l forgot to tell you try some shredded cheese and mix it in well they love this and also a little plain natural yoghurt (just a blob)For good ness sake you are the BOSS not him!!!!!

I would put something thicker over the heat pad also. You can try pinky mice sometimes a different look of food will encourage them to eat.
0dbcab5a78b72d97386463d98eaa4726aa	Dogtra makes the best Electric collars available today. Tritronics is good too, but more expensive. I use the Dogtra 1200 model. It has a range of 1 mile and works in all types of environments. They are also waterproof so your dog can wear it on rainy days. There is a protocol on their use so learn how to use one before putting it on your dog. As for the morons who have no idea what the proper use of an E collar can do for a dog, don't worry about them, they are just acting out their humanic instincts.|`|263d1051d0417e7c3be6b17aef038b6faa	those dogs are very active, and do need the exercise.

If so, and you can't get a reliable recall, then maybe a shock collar may work.  However, the dog still will need to be trained.  If you just think putting a collar on the dog and then shocking it will get the dog to come to you - think again!  If the collar is not used correctly, it will just scare the dog and she will run off even faster.  Then she'll learn if she is far enough away, she won't get shocked.  The shock collar is a tool, but needs to be used with obedience training.  I would contact a trainer who knows how to use a shock collar.  Many of the field dog trainers use them for field work, so someone who trains for the field may be a good start.  Ask for their help.  <br>  <br>  Another alternative is to find a fenced field.  I have Whippets and they can not ever be let to just run, because they will run off.  I've found that school grounds, baseball fields, dog parks, are good safe places to let my dogs get exercise.|`|ae108db02c12ef58e1d75f3c981eba34aa	Shock collars, crates, when did the dog stop becoming a pet.<br>  Put a long lead on him and you run with him.

Just when did a dog stop becoming a pet.|`|FgPZ8Sl8aa	Shock collars, in my opinion, should be used by someone who understands the different aspects of training. And to get a "cheap" one means you will probably end up getting the kind that hurt the dog. There are different kinds of corrective collars and different quality levels for those different kinds.<br>  <br>  I suggest you let a professional train your dog, then you should learn how to keep your dogs training a persistent habit because if you stop training your dog the dog will stop obeying. I also think you have a horrible perception of your pet. I am very doubtful that your dog is dumb, just untrained and disobedient.|`|v31NLs8aaa	Alright, I tryed a shock coller for my dog once. It just made him scared of me.

7WUvPI8maa	yes you do need to get her spayed after this. as far as her giving birth, just watch her for any signs she may have trouble with delivering. but try not to interfere much. your vet could give you some tips on what to do when she does go into labor. but you should really just let her birth on her own.|`|SUs4rN49aa	My cat had kittens back in October.. I wasn't there when she gave birth to them, the mom usually knows what to do. Was there anyone around her when she gave birth the first time? It's usually best to just give her space while she is having kittens.. just check in on her every 30 minutes or so. My cat had 5 kittens and it took her about 3-4 hours to have them all, the first 3 were within an hour, and the 4th was about 2 hours after, and then the last one I didn't even know about until I was going to bed!|`|MmRDzhaHaa	Hello, like you ive had a cats give birth alone twice,only to come home and only the one alive,not sure why, but they may have got squashed when the mother was giving birth and suffocated,as they do move about in their birthing bed,so after that i supervised births, and moved the kitten out of the way when she gave birth to the next,then this never happened again, and the whole litter survived,so i suggest you do this with this birth,but be sure to give privacy after they have all arrived safely, as some cats will reject them if people keep going to look at them,i done all this i have mentioned, and had a healthy and happy mother and kittens!|`|BQEjpIibaa	she might have been to young the first time to have kittens and didnt know what to do so she killed them. some cats do that. my cat just had kittens and only one survived too. the vet said either they were sick or she didnt know what to do. but now that you cat is older she will probably be fine. make sure your there when she has the kittens so if she tries to kill them you can stop them. <br>  <br>  good luck|`|5FZyDonbaa	It's not too late. Cats can be safely spayed right up until the moment of delivery. Call your local animal shelter for a referral to a low-cost vet or clinic.
YIvIVvWFaa	I think it is a very attractive dog! I love the dog's rough terrier look and the feistyness of chihuahuas. I once had a terrier and a terrier mix and, while they were rather stubborn, they were also intelligent and fun to live with. <br>  I'd say, go for it!<br>  <br>  As with people, a dog's hair must grow at a certain rate, so it will always grow back in, but whether it will be ready for the winter will depend on when you plan on cutting it. How about not cutting it very short the first year you have her? Then you can estimate how much cutting you can get away with and not have her freezing in the winter. Of course, there are always cute doggie coats you could use until it grows out enough.<br>  <br>  I like the terrier rough coat, so if she were mine, I wouldn't cut her hair at all, only comb or brush it regularly, unless the summers where you live are so hot that she was suffering. Even then, a certain amount of hair is desirable to protect her skin from sunburn.|`|1tOr2qLAaa	I think she is really cute, I wish I could adopt her. You can have her clipped in a summer cut, and then let is grow back for winter. I think whatever way her coat is she is adorable.

267654029483fa2bb26859cacc5fdc7daa	I have a dog that had a similar problem.  I had a behavioralist come over and help us out.  She called the behavior "shy-sharp", meaning she's really very submissive and nervous, but is so scared by the unfamiliar that she acts aggressively.  I needed to do a lot of socialization work with her and other people. Visitors and anyone wanting to pet her were given a treat and asked to pet her one the chin or chest area and then give her the treat.  I had the dog at heel/sit for this to happen and found that it worked much better with her sitting than standing.  It is going to take time to change this behavior and it shouldn't be punished either.  <br>  <br>  I would recommend at least a consultation with a good behavioralist, contact your local animal control or SPCA for a recommendation.  Pet stores may offer recommendations but they don't always have a personal relationship with the behavioralist or know how they work or reputation.  There was a tragedy from just such a recommendation in South Florida last year, where the dog died in front of his owners.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!  I no longer have any little wet accidents.|`|AA11624248	Sounds like she has fear aggression for children and dogs.  Do not punish her for submissive peeing since she is not able to control it. When you have guest come over give them a treat so give to your dog. But let the dog approach them. Do not stare directly into the dogs eye because that is a challenge of dominance. Do not approach the dog straight on,  approach in a curved path and slowly. Approaching straight on is rude in dog manners and another sign of a challenge or fight. Do not lean over your dog to pet her, another sign of dominance.  Do not pet your dog on top of the head or stomach(sign of dominance) instead pet under the chin and chest area.  To help build her confidence play tug of war and let her win sometimes.|`|a7ef756b743e715b83e727ca94b653ceaa	It's called being 'FEAR AGGRESSIVE'.<br>  <br>  You need to hire a behaviourist.

Your vet can prescribe a drug which increases urethral tone.  That, combined with keeping stress-provoking situations to a minimum, should help her accidents.  Punishments don't work - they'll only make it worse.|`|b3a9cb04f7081dd4a39e0319c3aa3acfaa	The "aggression" you're describing isn't aggression per se; it's actually a fear response -- as is the fearful urination.  It's looks "mean" but it's really born of fear.<br>  <br>  Dogs that didn't get a lot of socialization as puppies have difficulty when they grow up trying to cope with new people and new situations.  That difficulty usually shows itself as extreme aggression or fear.<br>  <br>  There are several things you can do to make your dog more confident and to fear-urinate less often:<br>  <br>  Put her into a socialization class.<br>  <br>  Tell folks to stay out of her personal space; dont step into the dog's space trying to pet or talk to her; let her decide when she's ready to approach them.  (Her barking at people before they meet her is her signal to them to "stay out of my space!".  When her space is respected, she'll be less prone to bark and lunge.)<br>  <br>  If you know guests are coming over, make sure she has lots of opportunities to empty her bladder BEFORE they arrive.<br>  <br>  NEVER punish a dog for fear-urination; it isn't something they can physically control, and your getting angry about it only reinforces the fear.
8accb9ae01507e9d4e1ed55a7caec396aa	according to the Encyclopedia of dog breeds the family the bulldog belongs to is Livestock dog, mountain dog, and Mastiff.|`|c00f0c88fd87eab318a8c216f2ad3825aa	I think its what happened when Yoda bred with a Cabbage Patch Doll.|`|75813b478d17f2b34ca2d7b49c3e0c4faa	I looked it up and found this:<br>  Historians are fairly confident that the Old English Bulldog is derived from ancient war dogs, such as, the old Mastiff or Alaunt. Others believe that the true origin of the breed is not entirely clear. Depictions in old prints show that the variety was without doubt a small Mastiff, with a comparatively long head. The word 'Mastiff' was eventually dropped when describing these smaller Mastiffs, as the Mastiff proper was found too slow for bull-baiting. Eventually, the Greyhound was crossed into the breed increasing the mastiff's speed, without losing the breed's ferocity. This step reduced the Old English Bulldog's size and weight, with the Greyhounds features seen in specimens of that time. <br>  As per - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English_Bulldog#Breeding" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English...</a><br>  <br>  I hope it helped|`|ed7be3452ef860b6c0d5d7f87c114842aa	it all depends on which type of "bulldog" you're questioning about. many different breeds we think are "purebred" are actually mixed to produce what dog is desired by man for work, show, game, companionship.

xqp28ETVaa	Canned food can cause excess calculus buildup on the teeth (looks like a shell on the tooth) and the mouth becomes a bacteria farm! Gum disease sets in and the teeth become loose. The issue now at hand is caring for your dog's loose tooth (may even have more that need to be extracted upon check up). Most likely your Vet will remove that tooth, clean all the teeth, check others for root damage and prescribe antibiotics. Every Vet goes about things a little differently based on each individual case but this is the typical situation in my experience.<br>  There are several forms of "teeth cleaning" agents that can be purchased through your Vet...toothbrushes to additives that are poured into the dog's drinking water. Speak to your Vet about recommendations. Good luck <3|`|eFkdCBjkaa	I'm going through this right now girl  Dry food is much better for his teeth..it helps to remove the tarter.. Do a combo of both.

Es como tú dices son seres vivientes y no deberían venderlos. Pero tenemos que reconocer que ese es el medio de algunas personas para vivir. Pero aquellas  que tienen camadas de perros no deberían de venderlos sino, regalarlos ha aquellas personas amantes de los animales. Ya que se de muchas que tienen animalitos no solo perros sino otros y son maltratados. Pero estamos en un mundo de consumismo y que  a todo le buscan provecho y ganancias.

ZSyzb3Zyaa	not at all. first of all, cats run on 4 legs and ostriches run on 2. they couldn't be anything alike if they run on different amounts of legs.
CS4MVhsfaa	Hi, Jessica!<br>  <br>  Yes, there is!<br>  <br>  It is called "Aquarium Sealant 100% Silicone".<br>  <br>  The brand of this that I carry is marketed by DAP (although it is manufactured by Dow Corning).<br>  <br>  It is specifically formulated to be harmless to fish once fully cured (either fresh water or salt water fish).<br>  <br>  It comes in a tube about the size of a toothpaste tube and can be found in most hardware stores and aquarium shops.<br>  <br>  Hope you found this helpful.<br>  <br>  John H|`|QrjjiOgTaa	yes aquarium sealent you can get it at petsmart and walmart|`|BJGudd52aa	Yes. There is many different grades of silicone available to the DIYer, the specific one you're looking for is one which will bond glass and cure watertight. This is typically either specific aquarium silicone, or a glass silicone rated for aquarium use. Others might work, but I wouldn't be willing to risk it in a tank more than about 12" deep. Personally I use Selleys Clear Aquarium Silicone Sealant, costs about $8 a tube here, and cures fairly quickly. Just give it a thorough wash-out before you use it and you're good to go.|`|qeOlkRM0aa	As others have already said, you need to get silicone made specifically for aquariums. Regular silicone has an anti fungal in it that can harm fish.|`|YEi2DKpYaa	Aquarium Sealant.

4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	Check with the American Holistic Veterinary Medical Association.  They have listings of such practitioners throughout the country.|`|DEdtNBBSaa	Wow, what a loving question. There is a grassroots trend in the US these days of people wanting to minimize vaccinations and antibiotics for their pet medical treatment.  There is a lot of evidence that some of the traditional practices for treating cat sicknesses actually aggravates them.  <br>  <br>  I realize you don't know how old your cat is, but he most likely has some good years ahead of him.  <br>  <br>  That said, older cats are more prone to feline UTI disorders - and our commercial cat food is a big contributor.   At this stage it may prove too challenging to move your guy to a raw food diet, but there are other homeopathic remedies you can turn to to make his life easier.  <br>  <br>  You may benefit from the article I wrote below about using a home remedy for cat's UTI. <br>  <br>  I hope the best long life for your dear feline friend.<br>  Kate
w1lh1INHaa	A nursing cat can get pregnant, so you must keep them separated.  Males are also known to kill kittens in order to make a female more interested in mating.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	YES she can and it would be very bad for her to do so.  Get him neutered now and keep him away from her for 2 months.  Keep him from getting near her now.|`|pC5SWxC3aa	Yep sure can.<br>  <br>  Confine her to another room, and if the kitten is a male only bring it in if it needs to be fed, and be sure and watch carefully.<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  Get her spayed.<br>  <br>  @Suzy Cutes: I did not know of the male cat killing off the offspring just so it can make another one, that is news to me. No male cats for me.|`|yLiOgVEYaa	yes. she can get pregnant. until he or she gets fixed, keep them separated for the time being. keep the male away from baby too. good luck!!
eZDoQPg8aa	It's minerals and salts that are in the water.  As the water evaporates, they deposit themselves in places.  Just take a clean plastic scrub pad and give them a rub; they clean right off.|`|Jtd7kXQSaa	This is hard water stains. You need a water softener. If this is on the out side of the tank you can remove it with vinegar and a new razor.|`|ebb288886a8d584fd5d6ddf1d6a43a7aaa	Are you using a water softner?  It's probably the chemicals left behind as the water evaporates.|`|WqybBIPpaa	mineral build up from water evaporation . your water may have high mineral counts|`|b9c206476271de6c0a321ebe042eb7f6aa	It's hard water deposits, probably calcium carbonate.<br>  Not much you can do about it, and I wouldn't worry too much.
6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	I know we are told not to use bark, walnut shell and such for their substrates because they good ingest it so I would think I would take it off. I use driftwood in mine so no bark there. You are right, they do love to climb. Several of mine hang out on their logs which lead up towards their basking lights all day.
6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	You are remembering that these reptiles are desert reptiles and don't need all that extra humidity in their environments right.  For most animals you give them fresh water each day and knew that going in. Great days, I change the water in 8 aquariums and the cats bowl everyday. Sorry if this sounds like a smart answer but come on. Why did you get something if you aren't willing to properly care for it.|`|6AnuPGD9aa	its something im looking into atm..<br>  <br>  my current design is a plastic box buried but accessible in the back corner of the tank, with a tube connected to a submersible pump.<br>  <br>  i havent done much research into it yet, because i need a new viv first, which i am designing myself..<br>  <br>  but i think there is potential to create a cheap officiant flow of water which can easily be topped up and cleaned..<br>  <br>  <br>  sorry if i was a little vague.. but hope i was helpful|`|Fvh7buJKaa	Well I know this may be rather be expensive but you might want to look into one of those pet water fountains.

asXq2cFDaa	Swimming upside down?<br>  Swim bladder disorder. Fast the tank for 2 days and if it is not better, feed thawed, peeled peas for a week strait. It should get better, if not, feed for longer.<br>  Take the snail out, pull slightly on the trapdoor. It is normal for snails to stay in their shells for long periods of time, floating is also normal for some species. If it opens freely changes are your snail has passed on. If there is resistance and it it hard to open, then your snail is alive.<br>  Good luck, freezing is not a good method, the clove oil method is if worse comes to worse. Add 10 drops of clove oil into aquarium water, put the fish in, add a few drops every few minutes until the fish die.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: PLEASE don't kill the fish! These fish are caught from the wild and deserve the best care you can give them. Try what I said, it should work!<br>  Please, don't euthanize yet, only use it as a last resort, swim bladder easily cured! Please, if you do choose to kill them if what I said does not work, do not freeze, yes that is humane for cold water fish, but torture for tropical fish! Use clove oil! It can be purchased from most drug stores.<br>  <br>  Edit:Oh, ok good! That is what you can do if they die.<br>  But I say try what I suggested. It has worked on a female betta of mine who came down with swim bladder.|`|dJs2s9pfaa	You should research before you get fish. Fish have different water requirements,not all fish are compatible together,different eating requirements, etc. Sounds like they died due to bad water quality. <br>  <br>  You should clean your tank, cycle it for a month before adding any new fish. If you get impatient and want to add fish before your tank is cycled then be sure to change out 25% of your water every 2-3 days until your water is cycled. <br>  <br>  You need all in one test strips to ensure that your tank is at acceptable levels. Once your tank is fully cycled (nitrites,nitrates,ammonia at zero) then you need to just do 25% WEEKLY water changes for maintainence.|`|SccU9zdNaa	Or be honest, and show that you have some real class, and call the petstore, and explain what is going on. They should be able to either direct you to some meds for it, which is better than killing it, or will probably refund your money.<br>  The snail is dead. go ahead and get rid of it.|`|Rm1u12mNaa	flush em and put them out of there misery|`|e880bf3780c6ebc1868c580fec232f00aa	freeze the fish<br>  ugh its lyk sushi talk<br>  lol<br>  <br>  but freeze it<br>  and before you go to the store<br>  tell them it died<br>  and it took time<br>  and leave it in hot water<br>  baggy|`|bDPVRtCNaa	1. Never flush a fish even if it is dead.<br>  2. Do not put the snail in the pond outside. <br>  <br>  I would rarely attribute aquarium failure to bad luck. It's more often caused by lack of effort. <br>  <br>  What size tank do you have?<br>  What is your maintenance routine for the tank?
stMcVPCMaa	I've never seen submissive peeing done in the typical "pee" posture; it's always more like they had no idea they were even peeing until it was too late.  <br>  <br>  It does sound like she's confused about exactly what you're expecting from her for potty training.  My suggestion would be to continue the verbal praise for peeing outside, but discontinue the petting because it's entirely possible that she's thinking petting and peeing go hand in hand, so, not so much that it's OK to pee when you pet her, but more that she might be thinking you're asking her to pee when you pet her.|`|vouUQQzBaa	It's not submission, it's excitement :P<br>  She's happy. Congratz you're doing a good job. She'll stop soon. Don't worry :)|`|aeXmMKRfaa	She is doing this for excitement|`|FQmZLqMdaa	If she always pees in the same place then you need to sterilize the carpet with a general carpet cleaner that has an odour remover so that she cannot smell it.  It could be that because she has done it once in that place then she thinks it is ok.  Again she is still only a young lady& will grow out of this habit.  Try taking her outside ten minutes earlier & see what that does.  It could be that when you reach over/touch her you catch her unawares & she cannot hold it. Accidents happen it could be just a phase of puppy hood.|`|4H45GkQSaa	i have have a almost 8 moth old puppy and when we first got her she piddled. my guess this is what she is doing because she is excited. we got rid of her piddling by taking her out every two hours and having two long walks. one after breakfast and one right before bed. having her on a structured scheduale and a longer walks will help her learn bladder control and hopefully stop this peeing thing which is probably piddling.|`|AA10401377	No matter what it is submission or being happy or scared you must not feed into it. When she does this don't yell or spank her; tell her NO firmly and if you think she needs to go pp take her out immediately but if not just move her away from you then ignore her if she tries to get your attention again. If she doing it because shes excited she'll learn she gets ignored when she dribbles and will learn to not dribble. If when you reach down to pet her and she dribbles when she come to you don't get verbally excitied or playful with her it may be making her do this just don't acknowlege her and SLOWLY warm to her.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	It's submissing peeing ...<br>  <br>  Why are you "bending over her?"  That's probably what's causing the peeing since it's a dominant move.<br>  <br>  Stop petting her when she pee's.  Jump up and down, tell her good dog, throw a ball for her ... stop petting her.  Stop being over her.  And for gods sake, the dog is 16 weeks old.  STOP taking it out every hour.  The dog needs to learn it can hold it longer than that.  And at 16 weeks, it should be able to hold it for 8 hours.  Taking her out at 4 is ok, but ... yeesh.  No wonder she dribbles every time time you touch her.  She thinks life is about peeing every hour.|`|PHOyKsmPaa	Yes, it is definatley submissive urination. Because he is bending over the top of her (showing dominance)  she is showing submission by urinating. It is a way dogs say "you are the boss" . If he approached her at a lower level and petted her under the head (chin) then she probably wouldn't do that.
F27az9NEaa	No, being neutered is a great idea.<br>  So kudos on that.<br>  Neutering a dog doesn't change the dog; neutering with a combination of training can change a dog. Along with positive reinforcement, exercise, and consistency.<br>  <br>  Humping isn't always a sexual thing with dogs. It can be done as a sign of dominance, or due to excitement.<br>  If he jumps up on people, correct him and give him another command.<br>  I would look into some training classes.<br>  Poodles are intelligent, active dogs and need proper physical and mental stimuli.|`|AA11244754	did you vet inform you that all of his sperm won't be gone until like a year AFTER being spayed.  That is the reason he's doing the dams but the reason he's like that with the males is the same reason and a dominance thing.  Also you might try giving him additional training.  Just be patient|`|rSqSxIyOaa	He doesn't do that because he is horny.  He does that in an effort to say he is the alpha of your pack.  I have a female poodle who does the same with my Border Collie.   I'll find her sitting on her back acting like she is bangin her.|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	The mounting and humping he's doing has nothing to do with sex...it is him being dominant.<br>  <br>  Neutering was a good idea.  But dogs don't become "more obedient" from the surgery.  That requires training...and that is YOUR responsibility.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	He's not looking for sex, he's displaying dominant behavior.  Which, would be worse if he wasn't neutered.<br>  <br>  The dog needs obedience training and you need to learn more about dogs.  So, sign up for a good obedience class and ask lots of questions, like this one, when you're there.|`|MuBLsT0baa	its good what he was neutered but you have to train him not to do those things since he was probably so used to it. take him out to exercise and make sure if he does start humping put him in is kennel to let him know you dont like that. but i think he has some pent up energy so i think an hour walk and an hour of play would calm him down a bit|`|FQmZLqMdaa	He does not want sex.  He is showing dominance.  You need to take him to obedience training.  It will be well worth the money.|`|b9BdG5LAaa	my dog does that too! shes a 4 yr, old poodle, and she also had the operation but she still jumps on people. i dont really know the reason either...|`|PM23RDycaa	Well if he was around a female in heat before her was fixed he knows what the smell means. Neutered males can still perform the act they just can't get the female pregnant. The humping of everyone else however is a dominance issue and only training will fix that. <br>  <br>  Neutering never was and never will be a fix all for behavioral problems. Training is. So stop letting him roam and find a trainer to help you with correcting his behavior when it comes to dominance mounting|`|y0cbLn0Yaa	Well, looks like you've fallen victim to the neutering is the magic bullet to cure all bad behaviours.  <br>  <br>  The ONLY way to cure a bad behaviour is through training.  Neutering can assist in extreme cases, but in general, consistent training is the solution to fixing dominance behaviours.<br>  <br>  Neutering is the best way to prevent breeding if you aren't responsible enough to be able to do this through supervision and common sense.
Fx9bxZ8aaa	when it is ready to give birth her gravid spot will turn kind of black or grayish.that's when you need to put her in the breading tank.you might as well already put her in the breeding tank because you never know when she will give birth and it will be safer for her to already be in there.she will also feel safer because with other fish around her she will be scared to give birth and she will hold so that she won't give birth and she can end up dieing.here is a website for reference.oh and guppys do not lay eggs they give birht to live fish.and you will need to remove them or they will be eaten by the mother or by other fish.she will act a bit stressful.she will not be active alot.|`|7L60FeYxaa	You will know when it is ready to give birth when about 28 days is up (average, it can be between 20 and 30) and the gravid spot is REALLY dark. I'd put her in a breeding tank now for her to get used to it so there is less stress closer to the birth.|`|3GEszyaqaa	when i had guppies i just let it do its thing. the baby's will take care of themselves|`|lbyX0GOJaa	wait and see<br>  when the babies com out of the egg remove them so other fish wont eat them|`|Qas05nZraa	wait for it to give birth|`|48b5600abf4e77aa235123b941d79043aa	When you start to see little eyeballs near the vent
z2cysiEhaa	The area around her vent usually swells and bulges. If she is egg bound she'd sit on the floor of the cage and appear to be straining and in pain.There also maybe runny droppings and blood. Egg bound birds need to see a vet ASAP as if the egg can't  be eliminated they can die.|`|dgzbj9ujaa	idk.<br>  it gets really fat??|`|Og1apzLNaa	when its belly is moving<br>  and it makes noises
pC5SWxC3aa	We cats like to do all kinds of tricks, but we wont try anything that stupid unless something is after us, or were a little tipsy and fall by mistake (in which your not suppose to see and make it out to be a YouTube moment cause we have cat skills right.) <br>  <br>  But anyways if we do for some reason slip and fall it would look more like an acrobat performance (rather than something falling to the ground like a laptop) and sure you can watch because you'll see that we would land on our feet and run back up the steps/stairs to try it again if it was fun the first time. Paws!<br>  <br>  <br>  Update--------------------------------...<br>  They can fall all they want in the house and not get injured, bear in mind that cats jump out of trees all the time. They a;mpst always find the easiest way down from high places.|`|cYuWbvSKaa	Well, if they are often abused, they probably are suicidal and jump. If not, they will be perfectly content NOT jumping!|`|KMrclzpLaa	Yes! cats aren't afraid of heights and most animals like a dog would probably be stupid enough to inspect it, plus most kittens are born blind for the first few months, so i would keep the back door shut at all times.|`|yLiOgVEYaa	i'll tell you this, they are not stupid, so they will not jump to the ground. but they are smart, so if they want down bad enough, they will jump down to the first balcony and then to the ground. i never thought my cat could or would make it to the first balcony, but he did.|`|gaxl5kD4aa	well do you think they would survive the fall?<br>  if not, keep an close eye supervision on them when they are outside.<br>  if you feel like you cant, then try to take them to a park nearby you and get them familiar with it, so it can be where they get their fresh air.|`|umEgRb7Vaa	They might not have the depth perception to realize how far up they are, so they might not be so cautious for that reason.|`|x0WZE0i4aa	I doubt they would deliberately jump, but cats do fall.  I've had one fall out of a 2nd floor window someone else left open (thankfully she was recovered unhurt).  One day it might be slippier than they expect due to rain, or windier, or cat 2 could jump up behind 1 and knock them...<br>  <br>  Cats don't always land uninjured.  A broken jaw is a common injury from a fall, and one that won't stop your cat running away scared and in pain.  Best to fence the balcony in (sides and top), or keep them off it.|`|uGIzTttsaa	well i don't know if its anything like my cat i wouldn't risk it. my cats an indoor/outdoor cat and it runs in front of cars crossing the road so i hate it to be outside. so i would just not let them out or if you do be out there with them but you never know they might be smart enough not to jump off a balcony.|`|YCmveH6laa	I would lock the patio door. My cat goes crazy when it comes to jumping, he doesn't even think about the consequences and goes flying and I do mean literally flying across the room!!!<br>  <br>  I wouldn't let my cat go anwhere near the outside becasue I will know he will jump!|`|rU7ZjIHKaa	Yes and no. I mean, cats vary in intelligence just like humans do. However, even if they are smart enough doesn't mean they won't fall off on accident.|`|4VRB5FwOaa	cats are not stupid, dont worry, your cats will not jump even if they see a bird on the balcony.|`|FwZus5tbaa	their not suicidal dodo birds...your fine, their fine|`|JivLAZH6aa	keep them off the proch|`|RsBbrLMoaa	try it out and when their out, just watch them. if one is missing...  well yeah you get my point.|`|ebb288886a8d584fd5d6ddf1d6a43a7aaa	It would be so easy for them to lose their footing and fall.

Be a good mommy and keep them in.|`|BHaIYH4Eaa	depends how trained your cats are, i have at two cats jump off my balcony. but luckly we got them back. keep an eye out on them if you do let them, but i wouldnt let them have excess to it when your not home.:)|`|hzgAeIbBaa	I don't think the would because they can sense how far the ground is, but just to be sure you should keep them away

If you have young kids or have relatives with them that visit none of these dogs are right for you.<br>  <br>  Do not buy mutts from breeders - you can find them at a shelter for lower prices (they will be the same quality: IE no genetic testing, poor backgrounds, etc.)<br>  <br>  As a Maltese owner i can tell you that they are NOT easy dogs: they need daily grooming, professional grooming at $100 a pop every few months, proper exercise and obedience training... and if they don't get that they can become snippy little monsters.|`|vouUQQzBaa	You can't know the health and/or temperament of the last two as they are both mixes and no guarantees there. That, and you are encouraging BYB/puppy millers to supply unhealthy dogs.<br>  <br>  Adopt either at the shelter if it doesn't matter to you whether it's a mix, if you want a purebred go to a REPUTABLE breeder, do research on the breeder of course and get the Maltese (out of your choices)|`|uBFhKXgHaa	Only one of those is an actual dog breed (Maltese). The other two are mutts. There is no such thing as a Cavachon or a Shih-Poo. Just a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel/Bichon Frise mix and a Shih-Tzu/Poodle mix. Mutts.<br>  <br>  Only backyard breeders breed mutts and then tack fancy 'designer dog' names onto them as if they were an actual breed. Please don't support these irresponsible breeders by lining their pockets with your money. If you want a mixed breed/mutt look no further than your local shelter.

Muz6YB18aa	Your main concern should be infection. You should get her to the vet as soon as possible. Dogs saliva is full of bacteria, and breaking the skin is like injecting the bacteria into a wound. Also, a dog bite is quite painful, like shredding the layers of skin and muscle. Your puppy needs her wound to be thoroughly cleaned, and bandaged. The longer you wait, the more the risk of infection. She needs to be put on antibiotics as soon as possible too. I worked at a vet hospital for 5 years and every dog bite that came in the door was ALWAYS treated with antibiotics, even if the bite looked minor and did not penetrate deep. As long as she doesn't require surgery, the bill should not be too bad ie: exam fee, treat and bandage, antibiotic injection, RX for antibiotics. It would be much cheaper to go now, than wait until it is abscessed. That would not only be expensive, but even more painful and traumatic than what she has already been through. Get her to the vet for sure tomorrow. <br>  <br>  Meanwhile, yes you can use a bit of neosporin, after you clean it thoroughly with something antibacterial (don't use peroxide- can hinder healing), vetrap would work best in that area- it only sticks to itself, not her fur. But don't wrap too tight. I have bought it before from my local feed supply store, but perhaps you can find it at pet store. You will need to apply a sterile gauze pad before wrapping it. All of these things will add up, so bringing her to the vet may be a better solution. My vet office sees pets until 7pm.<br>  <br>  P.S. It is instinctual for her not to show you her pain.|`|33PwXUblaa	Like some people alredy said, clean it with water or a disinfectant towel for dogs and try bandaging it with a gauze just so it doesn't get infected or dirty before you get to the vet!<br>  <br>  Make sure you do get to the vet though!<br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  EDIT: not really.....you could put a gauze under and then tie it up with a piece of cloth or something.<br>  My dog got run over by a car and the vet put a special bandage that sticks though so I guess the medical tape would work okay! =)|`|AA11244754	you need to get your pup to the vet because if you don't it can get infected then she could lose that leg which will cost a lot more to have it amputated than just to keep it clean and maybe get a cone collar for her.|`|FQmZLqMdaa	Try bathing the area with a weak salt water solution.|`|2639c3Pcaa	May I ask.. Why did you let your dog hangs out with the 12 weeks old puppy? I'm wondered if your dog bullied the lab and then the lab decided it was enough and bit your dog's leg. When you see two dogs  playing too rough or look like one of them just had enough of playing, it is time to step in and break up the rough playing.  Many owners don't keep a watchful eye on their dogs when they are playing til things got too far.|`|77hvFW46aa	i suggest in the mean time wrapping it up with a bandage or gauze.<br>  anything that will keep it from getting infected or leaking anything.|`|AA11887983	Clean the area thoroughly with warm water and a mild soap, like liquid dial.  You can also apply a warm compress for a few minutes.  Don't give any medications to the dog, because it may compromise what your vet needs to put her on.|`|x8Vgu6acaa	She should go to the vet immediately.  If she needs stitches it is better if the skin tear is fresh.

AA10327148	It is hard to tell which one caused the diarrhea. If it is truly diarrhea, and not just loose stools, then call the vet back, and ask if you should continue feeding that food. S/He may want you to feed him just plain chicken and rice. <br>  Diarrhea is more than 5 loose or liquid stools in a day, and usually before the dog can let you know he needs to go outside.|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	It could very well be the food the vet gave you.  Any time you change your dog's food suddenly, it causes diarreah.  I'm sure your vet had a reason for wanting you to feed it to your dog, I don't know what that reason was, you might want to ask your vet about it.  If the reason was to give your dog something easy to digest, it would have been easier on his system to make him boiled white rice with chicken or hamburger.  Hope he'll be ok.|`|vGH9ghiKaa	Cherish this moment, take lot's of pictures.|`|FQmZLqMdaa	Probably the canned dog food.  If he normally has dry food then the canned stuff is too rich for him.

NA44qrXYaa	I think that a Papillon would be a great breed for her. I have a Papillon and they make great pets. If it is raised around the kids then it should be very friendly and affectionate towards everyone. (Mine is a male, and he wasn't introduced to kids until he was two and he does excellent with my nephew Carter) Papillons resemble Chihuahuas but are much more laid back and do not come with all the problems Chihuahuas may come with. Papillons are also very friendly and will adjust to any of your pets including other dogs, cats, and even small mammals. The only animal that my Papillon is overly excited by is my Cockatiel, he would never hurt her but he just scares her sometimes. I wish the best of look for your friend, and I hope that she finds the dog that she wants! <br>  <br>  Make sure you tell her though, that Papillons are not cheap dogs, and they run anywhere from $800-$1000 on average from a reputable breeder.|`|aeXmMKRfaa	Miniature Dachshund|`|133a80b8f446ced791ae790df571f049aa	A shelter should be able to tell her how a dog is with kids and cats, as most usually evaluate the dog in these situations before adopting it out.

Bella is very low shedding...I could almost say she doesn't shed at all but every once in awhile she will have a little shedding.

8NSh1D4Maa	The average lifespan of an outdoor rabbit is around 5 years.  Indoors, 8-10.  Some rabbits will live well into their teens.  I lost my oldest rabbit last month at the age of 14.  Your rabbit should have several good years left at least if you care for him properly and he eats a proper diet.|`|MtxdBuxoaa	Well, that's hard to do. A healthy bunny with no health complications *should* live to be at least 7 or 8 years old. Many bunnies live up to ten years old, and I think the oldest rabbit on record was 13. It really depends on your rabbit, their genetics and their overall health. Unfortunately, because rabbits can succumb to so many illnesses and injuries, many do not live to see 'old age'.<br>  <br>  At the moment I have an eight year old Mini Rex.|`|iZcHb6Knaa	I would say it's around 8-10 for indoor rabbits that are well cared for.

The thing with this deal is to be very dog on a bone with it.  Dont quit.  If u need to go to the mayor of your city and complain.  There are many avenues u can take.  The thing is not to be vendictive but to keep other animals from being shot or people too.  The best thing is to make sure your animals can never get out and go over there again because this will be an invitation for him to shoot another one.  Good Luck!
rXMTdUg4aa	I don't know how big your dog is in comparison to the bone he ate. Watch him... if he become lethargic, stops eating, vomiting, and not voiding his bowls... anyone of these symptoms, take him to the vet immediately. This would mean that the bone has obstructed his bowls and needs surgery to remove it.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Still watch him closely. Even something as minute as a peice of string can bind a dog up. A bone can be VERY harmful. If he passes that bone I will be amazed! Check his stool everytime he goes.|`|vORwcxhkaa	You can either spend money going to vet when you dont have to or just wait to see if your dog gets constapated or not. If your dog isn't pooping at the normal times that he/she usually does, then take him/her to the vet<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)
vVAwFgcJaa	There is 3 ways I can think about: <br>  <br>  1- wait a month before to add your fish. This is the time required for your nitrogen cycle to establish.<br>  <br>  2- Go to a petshop, ask them if you could buy 5 gallons of water from their tank and buy some of their old filtration media. This way, your tank will be cycled immediatly. <br>  <br>  3- Have a look at the filtration system they sell at madcaptains.com. It work with Tri Base Carbon and Right Now Bacteria. I have used this system for over 50 tanks and it worked 100% of the time. It will also keep your tank free of No3 and Po4 without doing water change for years.|`|gQongGHUaa	give it two weeks of cycling.  twice a week add a small amount of flake food to the water to give the filter something to work with.  also treat the water with de-chlorinator before you put it in the tank.  and yes, 5 gallons is a little tight|`|asXq2cFDaa	Ok, I do not agree with the amount you are keeping, but seeing as you will not listen to anyone tell you different, let me give you some advice, ONLY 1 MALE! 1 male and 2 females, with nothing else!!<br>  here is a good article on fishless cycling. You must wait until it is fully cycled to add a dwarf puffer, and once weekly 50% water changes are necessary to keep water quality pristine.

Check the link out.
7cm4dZVaaa	The pics that I have seen of the top barrel racers, when direct reining, hold the reins at the length that they need them in both hands.  The portion of the rein coming from the horse's bit goes into your hand from the pinkie side, and out between the index finger and thumb, with the reins held in a loose fist.  There seems to be from 6 inches to a foot of slack between the reins.  My seat is not that secure, so when I direct rein a barrel horse, I slide my hand that will be to the inside of the turn down the rein, so that I can tip the horse's head around the turn. I only use one hand so that I can hold on to the horn with the other.
agh18eT2aa	She's not used to living outside, so she has no idea about inside manners.  You will have to teach her.  You MUST correct bad behavior while it's happening. If you do it later, she won't have any idea why you are correcting her.  The panting means it's too hot inside for her.  Dogs like cold, and labs have nice thick fur, so she's burning up.  Panting for a dog is sweating.  She's too hot.  Some dogs are much better off outside.  I think a lab is one of those.|`|c2c3a447ca6a35c94ffed12e17bf8913aa	You can have your vet check for any physical reasons for these behaviors... Rubbing her side sounds like she is itching..

I had a lab that for 13 years rubbed himself along the walls of our mudroom, rolled himself in cow crap during the summer, rolled in dirt from the holes he dug in our backyard, and scratched, bit, licked, chewed, sneezed, snorted, panted, drooled, and later in his years coughed, at least once every day. And you know what, that's what it is about dogs that people love - the characteristics that make them the animals that they are.<br>  <br>  It could be worse. All these characteristics could belong to your significant other. You know what, all these, and WORSE do. You know, at least your dog isn't talking back to you, or witholding affection because you didn't buy her a good enough ID tag.<br>  <br>  Your dog is being a good old dog. She'll die soon & you'll miss it.<br>  <br>  Get a fish next time.
FQmZLqMdaa	You need to spend hours playing & snuggling up so he feels secure.  <br>  He needs to go out every couple of hours so you may have to go down the garden with him.  When you are playing/snuggling get out the treats & practice come & sit.  When he has the hang of that put his lead on & take him out the back door, once he has got used to that move on a little by going out the garden onto the street.  When he has done it a few times he will go willingly but always take a few treats just in case he is reluctant to go.  When you get to the let's walk down the street try holding the lead closer to you i.e. handle in left hand/right (depending on where the pavement edge is) & then halfway down with your other hand so that puppy has a shorter leash & make him walk on the hedge side like this.  After a few weeks he will willingly go along the pavement & love to walk out with you.  He will be scaredof traffic & cars etc., so the best thing to do is to take him out for little trips to the local park so he can make friends with other dogs there & meet people & children to learn socialisation.  He will adjust & you will soon be able to enjoy your walks.|`|dWK0B5g3aa	Time.<br>  That's all I can say really, all puppies hate walking for the first few weeks. <br>  Just take treats and toys with you, maybe a playmate and stick to small spaces, as a large area is much scarier for a little puppy.<br>  When he's older he will probably have the Independence to explore but not until at least 6months, he is only a baby.<br>  Ignore him when he tries to get in between your legs, never pick him up, walk away and don't make him walk for more that 15-20 minutes at a time :)|`|0ZrRRGmiaa	Obediance Class works great for this problem. The teacher will show you all the tricks. We had this problem to but haven't had it since. You need to give the leash a little jerk to get the dog going where you want. When it doesn't want to listen keep giving the little jerk until they get. By no means hurt the dog just let it know your there and in charge. Also, walk at a brisker pace to keep the dogs attention on you. Give it less leash if it runs between your legs and try to keep the dog by your side. Good luck!! I hope this helps.|`|OPgXRcVvaa	I now excatly how you feel. My puppy does that all the time. I LOVE cocker spaniels! What you should do is, bring out one of his favorite toys and let him play with it or hold it. or just put him beside you and try to walk properly. Or just go to puppy training classesm, they will help you a lot!<br>  -Nicole<br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|bqUy7MKTaa	we used treats to get my dog to walk. i think him walking next to you is good though|`|6obGNHenaa	Give your dog some meat treats before you go outside on a walk. Then he'll want more, so he'll follow the treats outside. ( make sure you have a little bag of the meat treats.) for the whole walk, you give him some treats each 10 or 15 min. You have to do that for at lease maybe 2 or 3 month, then he'll get use to it.<br>  <br>  <br>                   Maybe he doesn't poop or pee because he's too afraid. Go see a vet and the vet will explain.|`|lvXL1RjUaa	Since your Cockalier is a puppy, it is going to be anxious and nervous,<br>  and if your using a regular leash then I would switch to a chest harness, it will make him feel more secure. Okay first I would start by luring him out with treats, or sitting down maybe outside the door and just pet him and get him to loosen up a bit and he might come to you. Then eventually when you get him outside, just stand around a bit and walk slowly, prasing and giving treats. With a slow pace he should eventually go to the bathroom ( remember to be patient, this may take some time. ). To get him to walk hold a treat in one hand while holding the leash with the other, let him know you have a treat then hold it in front of him then slowly raise your hand so its confortable for you, so he will stay focused on the treat, he will focus beccause he will want the treat! Walk a little ways with his attention on the treat then give it to him, start the process over again.<br>  Good luck with the training!|`|dcd11iUwaa	you shouldnt be walking her that young,<br>  her bones are still forming and there is no need.<br>  what you need to do is start basic obedience at home.<br>  do the whole sit stay down and when you are BOTH ready attach the leash and use treats to couch her by your side.

BJGudd52aa	I'm actually pretty amazed they're still alive if we're honest. I think the only saving grace that they haven't attacked one another to death is the sheer volume of them - there's no opportunity to establish a pecking order as yet. Not to mention the bioload will quickly have fouled the water, and unless you're doing multiple water changes a day I don't see you keeping up with it...<br>  <br>  In other words, yes, very much so. About the only Cichlid I could see keeping more than one of in a 15 for any length of time would be a Ram/Dwarf Cichlid (which work alright in a pair if you're diligent). Anything else is simply too big, and far too aggressive for a tank that size. Depending on the species I'd be considering a tank at least 4 times that size...|`|gQongGHUaa	wayyyyy to much.  i wouldnt even keep one in a 15 gallon.  cichlids in general need at least 25-30 gallons for a pair.  keeping a cichlid in a 15 gallon is very cramped.  6 is just torture|`|QrjjiOgTaa	ya. even with dwarf cichlids it would be close to being over stocked|`|R7Yjo9xSaa	yes that is WAY to many once they mature they will start to fight with each other and you may even stunt their growth and they could become deformed.. you need a bigger tank|`|asXq2cFDaa	Even with any sort of dwarf cichlid that would be to much.<br>  Could you specify the species?
8i90ov0Gaa	It's not necessary. It is a myth that feeding snakes in their enclosure makes them more aggressive, passed around from beginner to beginner. If you fed your snake in a separate enclosure, every time you go to handle it, it thinks it's feeding time. If you feed them in their enclosure, once they are out, they are calm because they know it's not feeding time. And you can always use a snake hook to pull any aggressive snakes out. Plus, with a snake fed in a separate enclosure, when you reach in to get it out, it is likely to bite you since snakes often go into a sort of feeding frenzy. I have 150 snakes and I feed all of them in their enclosure and can reach in and grab any of them without getting bitten, at least not because they thought my hand was food. I use feeding tongs, so they never see my hand anyway during feeding time. You won't find any professional breeders, zoo keepers, or herpetologists feeding their snakes in separate enclosures either. Here's a link from a reputable breeder saying it is a waste of time to feed snakes in separate enclosures: <a href="http://www.proexotics.com/FAQ2.html#snakes_feedingtub" rel="nofollow">http://www.proexotics.com/FAQ2.html#snak...</a><br>  <br>  Ha! Good one Varanid!|`|7WUvPI8maa	Yes. if you feed the snake while its in its enclosure then you risk having it become "aggressive" because it associates you putting your hand in with food. when you remove them from their enclosure and feed them in a separate one, it teaches them to associate that enclosure with feeding and the other as living. also you lower your chances of getting your hand mistaken for food. good luck|`|2CbfO4jWaa	"misnaming" your so much more patient then me with newbies and these stupid questions that 5 min. of research could answer. i was going to be my typical mean self here! you saved them. ha ha! congrats on reaching top answer my friend!<br>  <br>  edit: "certification in zoo management, 5+ years experience with exotic, endangered, and animals, former manager of reptile store".............HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH... didnt learn much about herps huh?(i couldent resist!! im gonna go get bit by something. j/k)|`|sSJ8zfebaa	never had a problem feeding in their cage-have 16 snakes.i use newspaper on the bottom|`|3t3aVj1Laa	I feed my Boa in her cage, i just change the corn cob bits once amonth|`|YzhZCs3Naa	it's not necessary but a good idea to prevent the snake from becoming 'cage aggressive'. If you feed in the cage, he could eventually associate your hand with feeding time. This happens in most cases, but not all the time. I had 2 Hog Island Boas and removed my male for feeding, but not my female. She never became aggressive. Actually, those two were the biggest hams! I would take the tweezers to their face when they shed and they would even open their mouths for me...they were an uncommon and odd bunch.<br>  <br>  also, bree made a good point with the risk of impaction. feeding in an area without substrate can prevent that from happening|`|5Wuoi5bsaa	I don't but i watch the snake each time it eats just in case he accidentally ingests something. And he hasn't been getting aggressive at all.|`|Jguzosm2aa	Generally, yes. This way you remove the risk of him ingesting any substrate and getting an impaction.

But don't listen to what everyone is saying, do NOT get her spayed YET. Wait until she's done her heat cycle, maybe even a few weeks after then do it. It is dangerous to spay a female in heat because it can cause severe internal bleeding, which can cause death because everything is more vascular during a heat cycle. Wait until she is done, then get her to a vet and make an appointment to get her spayed. For now you can also try leaving a nice bed and blankets around for her, and if she lets you then you can try a little hot water bottle on her, but not all cats will let you do that.|`|5FZyDonbaa	Most likely, she's in heat.

You'd be amazed at what lengths a cat in heat will go to to get outside and get pregnant.|`|ebb288886a8d584fd5d6ddf1d6a43a7aaa	Kitty is in heat !!  Yippes!!  Wayyyyy too young to have kittens.  A visit to the vet is in order, quickly!  If you do want kittens, go to your local shelter and adopt some.  But kitty needs fixed.|`|7LraxHIWaa	She's just in heat and horny looking 4 a mate.

That's not how you participate in any activity with your dog.  The majority of the fun is training with your dog in whatever it is you want to do.<br>  <br>  So, provided your puppy is show quality, find yourself a handling class and take, don't send, your puppy.  Check with any all-breed club wherever you live for classes.  You'll learn how to show her, what kind of show lead and collar you need, ring etiquette, etc. <br>  <br>  But after that, you'll need a papillon person to teach your about grooming for the show ring.  Talking to your puppy's breeder would be your best bet.|`|024lJBZ4aa	Actually, you can enter your dog in the "puppy" class, it's for pups<br>  6-8 months.  It's more for training than anything.<br>  <br>  Talk to your dogs breeder, she should be teach you how to handle your dog in the ring.  You can also find a handling class.  Many obedience training clubs offer handling classes, where they teach your dog how to gait, teach you how to handle, get the dog used to being touched by strangers and for you small breed, how to stand on the table.<br>  <br>  You can visit the AKC at <a href="http://www.akc.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.akc.org</a> to find a training club near you.|`|d2191893763b20a6b077367a131978aaaa	As others have said, the best source for info is the breeder of your puppy.<br>  <br>  You can go to www.akc.org<br>  <br>  search for calendar of events to find a local conformation show and go and watch. You can talk to some Pap breeders there.<br>  <br>  you can also find a listing of clubs on the akc site. Some may offer handling classes. Also there will be Papillon clubs and you can try contacting a member for info.<br>  <br>  Agility, rally and even obedience is very fun.|`|Ei85kgfdaa	Talk to your breeder. If she was sold as a show quality pup then you have a chance in the ring and your breeder will be the one to help you with everything from handling classes to entry fees.<br>  <br>  If she is not a show prospect then you arn't going to get very far and probably waste a lot of money in the end. Try obedience or agility with her instead.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	First of all is she registered with a reputable registry? If not you  will not be able to show in dog shows. Second of all you should try and find classes near you or go to dog shows near you. go to infodog.com to find some in your area. You do know how much a pro handler costs right? lots of money, they get paid for every show they go to for every dog they show, and for every level they win. the higher the award the more money they get.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	I would join a local dog club that has training in show handling.  Call around to different clubs and they will put you on the right track.|`|hrPeoPJpaa	A lot of large training areas have handling lessons in a group or private setting.  I would call around.  Your breeder should also have the information or even be able to help you.  Your dog is going to need a lot of work as are you.  I used to want to show, but found out that it's just not worth the effort to me, but I hope you enjoy it!  It's a lot more difficult than it looks!|`|OPgXRcVvaa	You should start with obedience. Papillon's are really good with that. First start off with sit. Hold a little treat and push your puppies bottom down and say "sit". Then give it a treat. Keep on doing it until it can do it on her own. Your smart i'm sure you can do it. Or just look up puppy training classes and there great. That's what i did with my puppy.<br>  -Nicole<br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	Any intact AKC *FULL* registered dog may enter any AKC conformation event,once it's over 6mons.old.<br>  <br>  If it isn't SHOW QUALITY,it will NOT win any points & will NEVER finish.<br>  <br>  YES OWNERS *CAN* handle their own dogs *&* WIN! The person who says pros are needed must have never had a QUALITY dog.<br>  <br>  A conformation dog must gait on lead,stack & be gone over by the judge,w/out flinching.<br>  <br>  GO & WATCH FIRST!!!! ALL up-coming AKC events are listed! Go watch,have a PRO look at your dog BEFORE you waste your money & time & look like a fool,OK?|`|qapJU3tMaa	Why not talk to your dogs breeder?  Certainly they are showing dogs if they are breeding.  Your dog isn't old enough to show.  You need to hire a professional trainer to show your dog.  Amateurs don't stand a chance in the breed ring.|`|rXMTdUg4aa	Hey! How about you just let your dog be a dog. Find another hobby that doesn't involve you putting your dog through a bunch of needless **** to make you feel accomplished. Spay her and love her.|`|4te7KD1Daa	Bailey G, I haven't had any problems with my papillon.|`|30BC5dBVaa	First you need to make sure your dog is AKC registered. I'm pretty sure if the dog isn't AKC registered you won't have a chance in showing her. If she isn't AKC registered you can get her registered, you just have to have proof of her breeding lines - which means you'd need to contact your breeder. If you can contact your breeder than by all means you should also see if they can give you information or connections to someone who does show papillons -  if they are good breeders they will have connections to people who do shows.<br>  <br>  Your vet may also be able to point you in the direction of someone who does shows, or, may be able to give you information about obedience training for shows, upcoming shows in your area, etc. <br>  <br>  I found the article linked in the bottom of this response too which seemed pretty good, it's from the AKC & is for people interested in showing their dog.
o3nNm1iAaa	Hi!<br>  <br>  Do you have more than one cockatiel? If yes then they are all females.|`|6iCOMx8laa	No male?|`|6VFh61jhaa	Obiously you have female birds and don't have a male. Birds, like humans must have a male and a female to reproduce, and even though there is no male, the females will keep laying eggs, much like chickens. Theses eggs however will be infertiile, since there is no sperm. That is why the eggs are infertile.|`|ShdV8jm4aa	Unless there is a male to fertilize the eggs the eggs will be dead. She will sit on them because that's instinct. Same thing with chickens. We eat their unfertilized eggs, but until a rooster fertilizes them do chicks pop out. <br>  My parakeet does the same thing. She lays about 4-5 eggs every 2 weeks. I throw them away after about a week, but she just makes more! <br>  If you want them fertilized and hatched, get a male.|`|Z9kCzIkyaa	if theres no male.. they will not be fertile.. these unfortunate occurrences happen quite often|`|BbT2UH3Caa	I agree, there has to be a male to fertilize it.|`|YaM8Elxtaa	Are they both female?|`|QB0CnrmJaa	For an egg to be fertile, you have to havea cock, or a male. <br>  <br>  Then the eggs would be fertile and the eggs would hatch in about 2 weeks. But please be careful, newborns are VERY delicate.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
E70A7aqcaa	Truly I don't know.  I have been told, however, that if the orange-ish patch of color on their "cheeks" is bright, it's a male, and if it's colorful but not as bright, it's female.  That would go along with what I know about the birds in the wild.  The male is usually the more colorful and brighter, and he flies better. "Mikan<3N. . ." 's answer sounds more like how you realize the gender of parakeets, which I have a LOT of familiarity with.  God Bless you.|`|Czh1fbQgaa	The easiest way to tell is females will lay eggs. Another, less reliable way is males are more brightly colored. This doesn't work however if the cockatiel is a special color like albino or lutino. Also, males are generally more energetic and like to whistle more. Another thing is a male will probably try to hump your hand (it kind of looks like they are scratching their bum). I have also heard females have white spots on the underside of their wings. My male cockatiel has those though, so I'm not sure thats true. Yes, he is a male for sure.|`|BbT2UH3Caa	well, if it lays an egg, its a female as u no...<br>  idk. sorry i only have parakeets. i can tell u how u can tell if its a male/female for a parakeet, but i doubt its the same w/ a cockatiel...<br>  <br>  the "nostrils" above their beak will turn blue if its a male.<br>  <br>  Male = Blue Nostrils<br>  <br>  Female = Brown Nostrils<br>  <br>  **But remember its for parakeets so it might not be the same for a cockatiel**<br>  <br>  sorry hope i helped...|`|o3nNm1iAaa	Hi!<br>  <br>  If it sings a lot and the orange spot on it's cheek is bright then it is male. If is does not sing all the time, has a faded orange spot on it's cheek, and if it lays an egg then it's a girl.

fBMSIlSIaa	You could get a reptile. Geckos and bearded dragons are pretty cool! Or fish. Really pretty fish. Turtles are cool, too!|`|YyWxPYuKaa	a hamster, goldfish, or turtle|`|9RqmSgFKaa	A tortoise.|`|ywoKvBInaa	a snake awesome pets|`|cDEWpfMPaa	I think you should get a regular female rat. Yes, it has fur, but it's shedding is very, very minimal. Almost unnoticeable. They are fairly cheap, just got to get the cage and necessities. Plus alot of avid rat owners, including myself, will even associate them like dogs. Meaning, that they are very intelligent, friendly and playful. I taught mine tricks and they always greet u when you enter the room. They are very social so two is better, but one is just as good. Definitely recommend, especially if u wanted a dog in the first place. If this is an option for u than I would go to your local library or pet store and get a book about rats to help u out prior to adopting.|`|Cza93x9daa	Well it depends what sort of animals/pets you like. I have two pet rats and their great! (And they don't shed hair at all), or even mice, fish, birds, axolotls (their really cool - their like fish with legs, and I actually want one! - look at a picture of one of google). There are so many great small pets that you could own, so good luck trying to choose one!|`|7WUvPI8maa	hamsters, though, they have fur do not shed and are very good pets that don't take up much space. you can also try fishes or a reptile (turtle, hermit crabs, snake, lizard...)|`|pC5SWxC3aa	Get a hissing cockroach.<br>  <br>  They make cool pets, and you can even take them to school being that they are so discrete at times. <br>  <br>  See:<br>  <a href="http://weblogs.sun-sentinel.com/news/specials/weirdflorida/blog/cockroach-thumb.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://weblogs.sun-sentinel.com/news/spe...</a>|`|AA11767283	i think a cat would be a good one! even though you cant touch it you can actually play with it|`|8vDyvxePaa	try a turtle, fish, or hermit crab<br>  <br>  or a parakeet, they're lots of fun.|`|Rf9eWfCvaa	A naked mole rat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! lol or a tuttle!!!!|`|pbxgYIeGaa	Well i've always wanted a burrowing cockroach... they dont shed much fur! lol|`|Qk0RNenmaa	well, if you're into strange looking pets, there is a hairless kind of rat... You could also get a lizard, snake, bird, turtle, tortoise, fish, or crab. Fish, crabs, turtles and tortoises don't have as much personality as the others do, though (well, at least in my experience)|`|ONFI9GfQaa	You can go for a praying mantis it is an insect but is harmless they can also live about two weeks without food so don't worry if you forgot to feed it.<br>  <br>  Remember though do research before ever buying a pet.|`|m56Ty3zmaa	you could get a goldfish...they easy to take care of...don't take up much space (depends on how big of an aquarium you want)...and they aren't furry...|`|W76Lzh3caa	uhmm a hamster? a fish!!? a turtle?|`|Czh1fbQgaa	You could get a bird! I have a cockatiel and he is the sweetest thing on the planet. Cockatiels are small, inexpensive, don't have hair, are super cuddly and playful, smart, and don't take up much room. Just make sure you do your research on everything for them and buy one handfed. Ones that are not handfed will most likely take your finger off if you try to go near them. My bird is sitting on my lap right now. The only problem is that they do poo alot. Once you are comfortable handling your bird, you can buy a bird diaper from avianfashions.com. Small size generally fits 'tiels.<br>  <br>  OH! even my total dog person parents couldn't resist the charm of little Phelix! My mom even taught him the wolf whistle and he does it every morning to me! And after reading the other reviews, some common answers were hamster and reptile and fish. If you want a fun pet that you can actually love and interact with, don't get any of those.<br>  <br>  I guess if a bird wouldn't work, mice are awsome. I have a mouse and had one before (he sadly passed away). They are actually really sweet and fun. Mine both loved to ride on my shoulder and play in my lap. They also take up VERY little space.
6beL9zycaa	I completely agree with Pretty Kitty.  It is shocking to see how many people are of the mentality "they don't feel any pain"  or "that's how farmers neuter cattle". The treatment of cattle, pigs, horses, etc. in industrial farming is horrific, & if most people saw what went on they would be sickened~ & many would stop eating meat altogether.<br>  <br>  To use the argument that "farmers do it" is the equivalent of saying "my neighbor works on his own car."  Except that the car actually doesn't feel any pain. People need to look at these cases for what they really are; farmers are nothing more than business people, trying to get as much money from their "product" as they can. That means little to NO veterinary care, & desensitized feelings & reasoning with regard to the animal's safety & well-being. Animals become nothing more than your neighbor's car to farmers.  If you don't believe it, watch any video from any animal rights organization. You will see unbelievable cruelty & disregard for the animal, & yes, it is definitely the NORM.<br>  <br>  ALL animals feel pain, just as humans do. All mammals have the same type of central nervous system, using the same type of synapses & pain receptors. To claim that animals "don't feel pain" is pure ignorance & quite frankly requires an inordinate amount of stupidity on the part of the person saying it.<br>  Common sense dictates that they feel pain, it is the key factor in survival's "fight or flight" equation.  This is why they are still used (unnecessarily) in laboratory experiments.  <br>  <br>  Horrendous suffering is inflicted upon animals in the name of "farming," "sport," "science," "breeding programs" (aka: puppy mills, etc.) & "entertainment."  Until people open their eyes & educate themselves, you are going to continue to be shocked by the answers you receive to these types of questions.  <br>  <br>  You did the right thing.  It's a start.<br>  <br>  The bottom line in all of this is greed & ignorance. If you want to get an idea of what these animals go through, hack off one of your own body parts. That's what they feel.  They just have no choice in the matter. The really sad thing is that it really wouldn't cost that much to make it a more comfortable procedure for the animals.|`|yLiOgVEYaa	you did the right thing by notifying the authorities. that is considered animal abuse. i don't know if i would really talk to her family as i'm sure they will find out soon what she did. just be sure to keep up with your complaint so you know the animal will be in good hands and that she doesn't do anything else stupid. she should not be a pet owner. good luck!!|`|yo65rDLDaa	good for you im happy that you did.. whats she was doing is completely wrong. maybe she needs help or just a good friend to talk to.. i think the least you can do is explain why you made the phone call and how her torturing a cat made you feel.  I think she might understand it more|`|mR0gkR5caa	if you are concerned, and she can hurt an animal then she might hurt herself or someone else and maybe you should tell someone. it is better to have her mad at you, then have her hurt or hurt someone or something. good luck|`|5XYlHv6Paa	Do you really care if you lose this lady as a friend???|`|BQEjpIibaa	you did the right thing. that was just cruel!|`|AA11121172	You did the right thing, by contacting a vet.  There will be nothing gained by telling her that you were the one who called, especially if you think she is mentally unstable.  Right now, she will be better off with a friend she can talk to rather than a neighbor who is out to get her.   She might guess, and then you come out with it.<br>  <br>  I would tell the family if you think their relative is mentally unsound, but make sure its a family member you trust and will listen to you.  You don't want a scene, and have a whole family made at you and it won't help your friends situation.|`|ebb288886a8d584fd5d6ddf1d6a43a7aaa	I don't know whether you should tell her or not, but please, keep yourself updated on what the SPCA is doing about this situation. What she did is animal cruelty.  I would also report this to your local authorities. She could be a threat to more than just her pets.  Sounds like she needs professional help in the worst way.  You could file the charges needed to keep her pets safe and any pending threats that could be inflicted on her grandchildren or other loved ones.  She's just not right.|`|Amkmles0aa	THATS OK TO DO THAT HAVE A GOOD DAY|`|AA11887983	As for the cat, he is probably ok.  As the previous poster mentioned,  cats used to be neutered without anesthesia.  I would not do it that way, but a large number of barn cats got neutered that way in the past, and were ok. <br>  <br>  I applaud your concern for your friend and her pets.  When someone is not acting responsible, it is important for other people to step in .  I don't think that you are acting as "big brother" as someone said, because you did express concern for the person as well.  <br>  <br>  You did the right thing.  Now just let the SPCA follow up.  And keep in touch with them.  Maybe you can help the woman get help for herself.  And even if she is not loony,  at least you can prevent further uncomfortable procedures on her pets.|`|eDySIDPQaa	Yes you should tell her, what she is doing is so wrong and she could kill the poor animal in the attempt to do it..<br>  <br>  Let her know now, and also let her know, she could go to jail and be fined for animal abuse as well..this may change her mind, please do it before she kills the animal..<br>  <br>  she needs help now|`|G032Flc3aa	Of course you did the right thing and I can see no reason for you to explain yourself to either your neighbour or her family, she did wrong and needs to be stopped from doing this or another medical procedure at home again, if she thinks she can learn how to do something as easily as that who's to say she won't take it into her head to do any other operation she thinks her cats need.<br>  Yes in days gone by farmers and vets used to castrate young animals without anaesthesia, indeed thirty years ago our vet castrated a kitten of ours in this way, and no doubt some still do, I know it is over in moments and probably has less effect on the animal that a general anaesthesia would have, but vets and farmers are trained either by practise or theory and know what they are about, that doesn't mean the general public should take it upon themselves to do the same.<br>  <br>  The very fact that the Vet's office and the SPCA have taken it so seriously proves that you did right beyond a shadow of doubt. If you do lose her friendship there's nothing much lost there!|`|IuYekkPVaa	I think that you did the right thing and am shocked that so many people think otherwise.  You are right to be concerned for the welfare of her animals and your neighbour's mental state.  Aside from it being illegal, many animal shelters and welfare organisations offer low cost spaying and neutering, so there is no excuse for someone performing this procedure themselves.  If you had ignored the situation, who's to say what other surgical procedures she may attempt to carry out in the future.<br>  <br>  I would have acted exactly the same in your position.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	While your friend may have had every good intention, if she is untrained in doing the procedure, she is in the wrong.  Vets have licenses to perform surgeries and equipment to do the surgeries with.  Neuter is a rather simple operation but that doesn't mean just anybody should be castrating their cats.  Lord help her if she decides to "help" out other people's cats or strays.  She is practicing medicine without a license and that's wrong.  I understand farmers are usually old school and have some experience but no one has any business doing it...especially in non-sterile conditions with no anesthesia.<br>  <br>  You don't really have to tell her you reported her.  You will remain anonymous if the SPCA decides to investigate.  As for your friendship, who knows.  My own dad was angry with me for a while after I seized his puppy he was about to shoot due to needing vet care.  He was about to practice "old school" euthanization.  I took his dog and told him I would report him if he ever got another one.  It cost $40 for the vet to fix the dog up. Dad eventually got over it but is certain I will hold my ground so he doesn't even talk about a dog anymore.  Maybe your friend will do the same.  Sad situation.

I have a Tibetan Mastiff, Great Pyrenees, Caucasian Ovcharka and an Irish Wolfhound and 2 Maine Coon cats.  They all get along just fine.  The wolfhound was raised with cats.  I got the other 3 as adults through their respective breed rescues and have never allowed them to chase or hurt the cats.  After a while they accepted the cats as part of their family and now they greet/lick each other, curl up to sleep together and coexist just fine.

Each dog is different some like cats cause they were raised with them, while other dogs just have such a high prey instinct that it might be impossible.<br>  <br>  You do know that a Guard Dog has to be trained, right?  It is not always instinct.  Besides you have to have control of the dog 100% of the time.  So if he cannot follow commands then it ain't much of a guard dog, huh?  It takes about 4 to 6 months to train a Guard Dog & you need to know all of the commands.  It starts with basic obedience, advanced obedience & the aggression work.<br>  <br>  The aggression work does not start until the dog is about 2 yrs. old.  It has to be mature enough to understand that it is not a game & not to be taken lightly.<br>  <br>  Breed doesn't matter,  it is the training that is important & you need to find a good qualified trainer to do this.  Some times they take the dog into their compound & keep it for about 3 to 4 months & they dog the training & then you come in & learn how to handle the dog the way it was trained.<br>  <br>  If you need a dog just to alarm you when someone or something is in or near the yard just get the dog fence trained.

AA11887983	Train your dog properly.  That means learning to use a leash, not a belt!  <br>  <br>  And crate the dog when you are not home.|`|35f126768433fb7bc9a5037cf6657dbcaa	NEVER hit a pet...i use a penny can to train a dog with works well. lots of love and treats, too. works very well|`|v4vQSzu4aa	Using a spritzer filled with water works well, or the SOUND of a snapping paper in the general room will startle them but not actually hitting the animal what so ever, try these first.  If this continues, your pet might be having some mouth or teeth issues and biting the furniture is easing the pain, possibly.  Usually, such behavior is another problem they are having, but just have no other way to tell you except to attack one of YOUR things.   Be observant and watch you pet, if this persists, you might want to venture to the Vets for some professional advice, I've had cats my whole life and have never experienced this situation before.  I wish you luck and a wonderful weekend!|`|McA6PFUyaa	its a puppy, it will chew on things, anything.<br>  if you smack the dog it will just make it afraid, of you.<br>  give the dog something that you DO want it to chew on.<br>  when you catch the dog chewing on something you don't want it to, say NO!<br>  then give it the chew toy you want it to chew on, and praise it.<br>  blue heelers are very active.<br>  they will chew when board or full of youthfull excitement, or teething.<br>  don't smack the dog. it scars puppies.|`|PmaB839Naa	No belt.

It smells good, it has natural oil for your furniture and your pet hates the taste.  Use a fresh lemon only and squeeze the juice in a cup and put in on the areas your pet tends to chew.  DO NOT HIT AN ANIMAL!!!  If you can't handle him give him to someone that can.

AA10616287	Do you mean the goldfish is in the same room as the oven?  I think as long as the self-cleaning function is not used every day, it should be ok.  Be sure the cover is on the aquarium if your fish is in one.  You might even want to cover the tank entirely as an extra precaution. If the fish is in a bowl, you might want to drape a towel or heavy cloth over the top of the bowl.  (The fish will still be able to get oxygen..don't worry)  The little smoke and ash that results from a self-cleaning oven should be fairly minimal though.|`|TjLCnxkKaa	If your goldfish can use a self cleaning oven you should get a good publicist and make money.|`|z2cysiEhaa	Depends what you intend to do with it.<br>  Can you clarify your question?|`|ZYzhBhgJaa	I'm not certain, but to be careful, I would cover the tank. An employee at a LFS was telling my just the other day that I should not spray any type of cleaning chemicals, like windex, in the same room as the tank, much less near the tank. He told me that he new a woman who killed her fish by doing her nails while sitting near her tank, the fumes aggravated the fish. I have never heard of this, but buying new fish once you have a tank established, and starting over can be pretty costly. Doesn't hurt to err on the side of caution.

But thats because I have them in a proper tank. I have my bettas in separate 2.5 gallon heated and filtered tanks. They are all very healthy.<br>  <br>  When bettas are in bowls, they slowly die. When they dont have heaters, they become lethargic, and slowly die. So basically, you need to have them in at least a 2.5 gallon heated and filtered tank for them to be properly cared for. If you have anything less, you are doing it wrong, and they will die.|`|IrdZKYT3aa	It sounds like he is cold.  Betta fish can TOLERATE being cold, but they don't WANT to be cold.  And just like us, being too cold for too long can lead to a whole host of health problems.  They are a tropical fish after all.<br>  Up his temp to about 80 degrees, this should help to perk him up.  He's basically borderline dormant right now, this in and of it's self won't kill him, but what it can open the door to will.  Being cold lowers their immune system, and not eating well or regularly doesn't help either. This makes them more susceptible to diseases they may have other wise fought off.  Many opportunistic bacteria, fungi and parasites are already present in your water, just waiting for a chance to attack.<br>  You can also add a little freshwater aquarium salt, this helps increase their slime coat, boost their immune system, lower stress and makes the water less hospitable for many bacteria, fungi and parasites.<br>  Best of Luck!|`|AA11449072	If you have him in a small bowl that's not filtered or heated then yes he probably is.<br>  Betta fish are just like any tropical, they just breath surface air.

It's not fair or realistic to expect your dog--especially a working breed --to spend long hours quietly sitting and waiting for your return. By nature dogs are curious and sentient beings; see that she has enough mental and physical stimulation to minimize the impulse to dig and chew.<br>  here's a treatment:<br>  <a href="http://www.mediumurl.com/?r=766215016470107364502242881286" rel="nofollow">http://www.mediumurl.com/?r=766215016470...</a> <br>  <br>  hope this helps.|`|7Rp256IOaa	This is probably a self rewarding activity for her.  As others have said it could be boredom which needs to be addressed.  You could build her a sand box where it is appropriate for her to dig and get that enjoyment.  This could help aleviate some of the boredome.  You could bury toys and treats in the sand box and have her go find them.  This will allow you to not focus on the behavior you don't like, and focus her on the behavior that is acceptable.  And by all means, think of some fun things the two of you could do together to tire her out.  A tired dog is a well behaved dog.|`|HahMElFZaa	My dogs used to dig for gold.

f8370a0d5431dc87bf7c2cb18914960caa	Although it is true that Sharpei's are prone to a number of different health problems, Such as Entropion (condition where the eyelid turns inward), Cherry Eye (the prolapse of the third eyelid) Cancer, Hip dysplasia, luxating patellas { possible dislocation of the kneecap}, And a variety of different skin conditions, does not mean that all will come down with such problems.... All of which can be costly.... I would suggest doing some research and find a breeder with no less than ten yrs experience with the breed.. Ask questions, Do they screen their breeding stock for genetic defects? Have the parents been cleared????  Do they offer a warranty on congential or hereditary defects and if so how long does the warranty last and what defects do they cover {most reputable breeders will cover for a minimum of 5 yrs, others offer their services for the lifetime of the animal}??? Do they line-breed or inbreed???? ( Breed related dogs together)  Which is not always a good thing "when done incorrectly".  Line- breeding {The practice of breeding distantly related dogs together} is often used by experienced breeders to stengthen desired traits. Have the Parents and/or pups been Temperment tested???   At the very least find a breeder who has had several generations of Sharpeis {with solid established bloodlines} bred with no major health and/or temperment issues, ask to see the medical certifications on the parents....  Also if at all possible arrange for a meet and greet at the breeders home.. Check out the living conditions of the animals, do they appear suitable??,  Is at least the mother available to be seen??ask for references" names and numbers of past clients, veternarian offices, etc ".   If you do this and all questions are answered honestly and in detail, certifications are good, and overall quality of care appears acceptable chances are you will be able to aqquire yourself a very health pup and should not have any problems... Just be warned that this DOES NOT guarantee that there will be no problems, it just means that you are less likely to have any.... Remember, Flukes do happen even in the best of bloodlines and nothing is 100% guaranteed.... Hope this helps....|`|4dd1b493eb9feeba46346cf2ec149ad6aa	They are not very nice-<br>  I got bitten once|`|AA11706151	This is a breed that I have NEVER recommended to anyone.

It'll pop up a list of dips, sprays, oral meds and the like to help fight this off.  I've had great success with Happy Jack medications so I suggest looking into those.|`|AA11947327	Yes, you can treat it at home.  Those mites are caused by a poor immune system, poor diet, or neglect.  It he is loaded with worms, then the immune system can't work correctly.  Also make sure you have a good diet for this dog.  Meat should be the first ingredient on the dog food label.|`|bb4c320128a049784f5bc2378c4fb779aa	i am not sure if that is another name for demodectic mange.  if it is, it's the type of mange that is not contagious.  yes, you can treat it at home, but you have to get the prescription meds from your vet.  they should give you a dip that is nasty stuff, so make sure that you wear rubber gloves and a raincoat.  your dog will need to be dipped 1-2 x a week for i think 7 weeks.  they might also give you ivermectin, which is usually a heartworm preventative, but also treats this type of mange.  there are some risks with the ivermectin treatment which are higher for certain breeds, ask your vet about that or look it up online.<br>  <br>  try not to miss any treatments b/c it will come back.  if you have a female, make sure she is fixed b/c when she goes into heat the problem can flare up.  also, there is a genetic component, so you don't want to breed your dog anyway b/c the pups would have it as well.<br>  <br>  some people used to dip there dog in used motor oil.  DON'T DO THAT.  it makes the mange untreatable and is really dangerous for your dog.<br>  <br>  if you were trying to avoid a vet bill, sorry.  i don't think there is anything you can buy over-the-counter.  if there is, your best bet would be at a feed store.|`|AA11928141	Demodex is a mite that is found on all dogs. Some dogs have a bad immune system and react to those normal mites in an abnormal way. The tendency to react to the mites is hereditary and those animals that have the condition in more than one or two small spots should not be bred.<br>  <br>  If your dog has only one or two spots (on the face or feet), it may require no treatment at all except for maybe some antibiotics for a secondary skin infection. This is called "localized demodex."<br>  <br>  If your dog has several large spots all over its body (generalized demodex), it will require long-term treatment (maybe months) under the care of a veterinarian. There are several options with varying cost. Medicated shampoos 2 - 3 times a week, with either a dip (amitraz or mitaban) every 2 weeks or an oral medication (ivermectin). The dogs with generalized demodex usually have to be on anitbiotics for several weeks as well (Cephalexin or Keflex).<br>  <br>  Good luck and call your vet.
AA12260609	I do believe that unfortunately you will have to still pay the bill even though you feel they are neglegent.  After this incident i would look for another vet that cares, unfortunately there are alot of incompetent vets out there and that are out to get your money instead of helping. If you feel they are neglegant contact a lawyer and see what they say, some will do free consultations.|`|AA12052123	More than likely You will NOT get out of paying this bill, at least most of it. I hear these complaints all the time...I work in an animal hospital. The only thing is, we were not in the room with you. We do not know EXACTLY what the vet did say. Or the fact if you were really listening. Or if you understood what he was saying. Allot of owners just sit there and nod...If your puppy simply "jarred" his leg. There would be no reason for a splint...NONE! And the vet would (almost 100% sure) not ask you to come in 2morrow...leg "sprains", "muscle twist", or "jarring" usually take atleast a few days of no activity and possible medication...at least a few days. <br>  <br>  So if indeed this story played out as you say, then go to another vet. Make a stink about the bill in a calm rational way. You may get some compensation. You get more bee's with honey! <br>  <br>  If you go to a different vet, GET THE X-RAYS! So they do not have to take more...|`|614dcf3ac8525574c75f0f59a95e8d5daa	Ummm...best bet would be to talk to a lawyer, see what he or she has to say. Hope it works out for the best for you!<br>  <br>  TDK|`|AA10511925	If you agreed to have services performed, you indeed will have to pay.  The only *possible* thing they *may* take off the bill is the splint that fell off, but I doubt it.  I work in an animal hosiptal, and if a client had a splint or bandage fall off on the way home and they came richt back in, we would replace it at no charge.  We would not refund any money though.  If the client called a day or 2 layer to say it had fallen off on the way home, we would not replace it for free.  "Jarrred" is not a medical term, so I have no idea what you mean by this, did your vet really say "jarred"?  Sprains and strains usually require strict reat, not a splint.  If your vet saw a fracture on the xray, then a splint would be in order.  I'd seek another vet, since you obviously do not trust this one.  Ask for a copy of your xrays (which they most likely will not give you if you owe them money) and see another vet.  See if they would recommend the splint (as in something is broken)-if not you can most likely get out pf paying for the splint charge only.<br>  <br>  vet tech

Do not let her sleep on your bed..  especially above your head.  Have her sleep in a crate in your room so she can see who the alpha is. <br>  2.  Do not let her walk thru the door before you.  You may have to put her on a leash attached to you for 5 - 7 days.<br>  3.  Do not have open feeding..  you feed her when you say..  give her 5 mins to eat then if she has not started///  pick it up.<br>  4.  Do not let her push her head under your hand to pet her.  The alpha demands the others to groom them or pet them upon demand.<br>  5.  Do not let her lick your hands or face to groom you.<br>  6.  DO  get a warm wash cloth and clean her face and eyes and ears.  Alphas groom when "they" want. <br>  7.  No more free treats..  she must sit or lay down or do something to earn her treat.<br>  <br>  At some point she will challenge you for the Alpha position.  I have 6 German Sheps but prior to this I had a very head strong Alpha Maltese Female.  <br>  <br>  Do not push this last issue as you may not need to do this if the subtle ways work...  It will be easy enough to know.  <br>  <br>  8.  If and When she bares her teeth.  Place your hands on either side of her neck (do not choke or circle her neck please) .. and lift her front feet off the floor.  Look her straight in the eyes and growl back at her "do not look away / this is an absolute..  if you do / you loose"..  you may have to bare your teeth too...  Trust me..  she will eventually drop her little paws which will start out being ridged and straight out..  when you can sway her back and forth easily and she has displayed she is giving in ... / then lower her feet back down and shove her away from you...  I KNOW IT SOUNDS MEAN.. But you are the Alpha...  You should, within this 2-3 mins become her absolute Alpha...   Then in about 5 mins call her to you and groom her.<br>  <br>  You now have the tools to work with your little Alpha dog so you can all live a happier life.  <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK<br>  And yes, I am a trainer/ handler of dogs.|`|13dded66b3bbf7efd78d04740e1abec3aa	Are you a member of Yahoo groups? Do a search under canine aggression and there are a few good groups that discuss these issues. Join one of them. <br>  I had an issue with aggression with my BT / Lab mix. First thing is to watch how you correct the behavior. Do not use any scare tactics (rolled up paper, rattle can, squirt bottle, spanking, etc) these will ALL make the problem WORSE.

A dog baring his teeth means that you better back off, or you're going to get bit. The dog can sense that this makes you scared, and so he gains the upper hand. I'd call my vet and ask about this behavior and if he would change if he got into an obedience class.

She said it was really cool cause it ran fast and she stopped to look at it. You can find them under rocks, etc. But be careful don't try to handle it unless you are a professional. Happy spider hunting. ;-)|`|261acc6eb4f0e0c39b9f7ba984093fe5aa	Its not legal to just take an spider from the wild, you could be getting into all sorts of trouble doing that (you could end up with a potentially very dangerous spider in your home!);|`|AA10838924	It IS perfectly legal to collect tarantulas in the wild in New Mexico, except  on public land.  There are several species of tarantula, all in the genus Aphonopelma, in New Mexico, including some which have not been formally classified scientifically yet.  The most common species is Aphonopelma chalcodes, or "New Mexican blonde", a very docile species.  <br>  <br>  Tarantulas are nocturnal, and they are also burrowers.  Typically, they dig their burrows under rocks or logs.  Look for a perfectly round hole lined with thick silk, underneath rocks or other sources of shade/shelter.  The best way to collect the spider is to SLOWLY pour water down the hole, not so fast as to overtake and drown the spider, but enough to make it leave(tarantulas HATE getting their feet wet), and be prepared with a plastic deli cup with a lid to collect it, putting something behind the spider to prevent it from running back to the burrow when it sees you.  AVOID collecting tarantulas that you see out wandering in the late summer and fall; these are mature males who are looking for mates.  They will live only a short time, often just a few weeks after reaching maturity, and will spend that time doing one thing-looking for a female.  They will literally often batter themselves on an enclosure if they cannot get out to search for mates, plus they will soon die.  A female tarantula can live for up to 30 years.  I have a 13-year-old female of a "dwarf" species that came from New Mexico, from the Las Cruces area, and she's a great little spider.|`|ccbb2a2ef1a30e32d9551fe19070d609aa	i used to live in new mexico .. we moved our frig and found one hiding under it|`|diAMW4hxaa	1.) it is the wrong time of year to go tarantula hunting. <br>  <br>  2.) tarantula's burrow in the ground. <br>  <br>  3.) the best time to see one is in the fall (mating season)<br>  <br>  4.) the venom of a tarantula is minimal, much less than a bee and they will not bite unless provoked. They are not the dangerous spiders people make them out to be.<br>  <br>  If you are needing this info for a report, the internet holds a wealth of information. If you are wanting to get one as a pet I recommend not doing it. Let the spider stay in its natural environment.

AA10788045	Mine was the same way....I kept feeding her ahd she would not go to the bathroom!!  Someone then told me the mom cat licks their butts and it makes them go...I was skeptical but wanted my kitten to be healthy.  NO I DID NOT LICK HER BUTT!  But I got a wash cloth (texture kinda rough like a cats tongue) put warm water on it and wiped her butt.  Not sure if it was a because of that but she started to poop.  Also do you have a litter box?  Take the kitten to the box and scoop its front paws in there (that lets them know where to go) Also what you are feeding them is fine...at the time I didn't know any better and was actually feeding mine cow milk.|`|7e354f22d8d8b33cf8efe82443dfb3a5aa	Probably need to dilute the Enfamil a bit with sterile water.

Take a warm washer and give them a tummy rub, belly and sides. gently, or you can use your hands, then stimulate the anus and see if that helps.|`|AA11527215	Normally, kittens will have a couple of firm, yellowish stools per day if they are being properlyf ed. Also after each feeding, you will need to gently massage and stimulate the anal and genitalarea with a sterile cotton ball or piece of gauze dipped in warm water. This will cause the kittento urinate and have bowel movements, and it is very important that you continue to do this forthe kitten until it is definitely using the litterbox on its own, even though most kittens can con-trol their own bowel movements at about 10 days old.|`|cf85fc6dd024c60de9b5cb73ce4250eaaa	Rub their stomachs and anuses with a soft,warm,slightly damp towel.

You can find it at Walmart or any pet store. The Enfamil with iron is constipating the poor little dears. Kittens can't process human baby formula...it could kill them.<br>  Also, to stimulate the kittens to go potty, you need to gently massage that area with a warm, wet cloth. The mother cat usually licks the kittens down there to stimulate them to go.<br>  <br>  Nix the baby formula and go get the kitten formula. It's inexpensive and it works very well.<br>  <br>  Good luck with the little dears!

qoWpn7GWaa	The very first thing you MUST do is this: DO NOT REACT when she bites you, neither positive or negative. If you react, that is what she wants, attention, and if she gets it from biting, she will continue to bite. After she is done biting, put your finger gently on her beak and say firmly, but without yelling "No." Then put her in her cage for a few minutes, and cover it, unless she's scared of the dark, which believe it or not, a lot of birds are.<br>  <br>  There are a number of reasons why she could be biting you, you said you've had her for almost four years and have never gone through this in springtime? Maybe it's mating season in combination with... her moulting? Moulting makes birds very grouchy. If you don't already know what to look for in a moulting bird, it looks like little white needles coming out of her face, head and neck.<br>  <br>  To help her moulting you can give her a bath or a shower or you can mist her with warm water in a spray bottle, make sure you don't spray her, but spray just above her so that the mist falls on her like rain. If your bird lets you touch her head you can also touch her pinfeathers, and if one feels like it's ready to come off you can scratch at it. If it doesn't come off right away, leave it be, these little keratin sheaths are full of blood and removing on that's not ready to come off can hurt her.<br>  <br>  To help with the hormones you should make sure that she's getting a full 12 hours of darkness, and make sure she stays on a firm schedule. <br>  <br>  These two things should help. But if they don't just ask another question, and add that those two things didn't help.|`|7Y2ih47Baa	She could be biting you for a number of reasons. (1) She knows she is going back in her cage and she isn't wanting to and she is letting you know that. (2) She is wanting to mate and they do tend to get a little aggressive during mating season and it is time for that. (3) She is starting to bond more with your husband and is turning away from you.<br>  The screaming could be for more attention or because the mating season and she is getting frustrated.|`|MTscbknIaa	She is  showing her authority, grab her beak while she is below your eye level and tell her no. also make sure that when your putting her to bed that its below your eye level. When she screams put her back on her stand or cage if she already is then cover her cage.

bFNIPzVsaa	When it comes to gravel in fish tanks it 1 pound per 1 gallon.<br>  Which means your safe with putting up to 100 pounds of gravel or rock in the bottom of the tank, just ensure that it is correctly set up on a correct stand.|`|9kceDOTraa	I dunno that's a good question really.  I haven't seen anyone that's measured a tank's ability to withstand pressures exerted on it like that.  I can say basically, the 100 lbs of sand shouldn't be that much of an issue, but tacking on another 200 lbs of rock on top of that, might be.  It's the bottom section of glass I'd worry about, not the stand or the sides, but the bottom piece itself is what will be supporting and directly interacting with all that rock and sand. <br>  <br>  I don't honestly know if this would be safe or not, if it were me, I'd scale the rock back a bit if you already have that much sand.  Mbuna are basically the only African types that really need rocks anyways.  Haps and Peacocks don't typically dwell that low in the tank to get much benefit from the rocks.  You didn't say what type of Africans you have, but if you've stocked up on rocks, I'm assuming that means a Mbuna tank.
znGpjsGjaa	Google poultry hatcheries. Then look for one that has the breed you are looking for.

Rx7wv4JLaa	Small breed of dogs take longer then larger breeds to potty train. This is b/c they have smaller bladders and can take longer to learn how to control them. <br>  <br>  No dog, no matter the breed should not be expected to be fully potty trained until at least 6-8 months old. This again has to do with their bladders growing. <br>  <br>  At 4 months old you should be taking her out every 4 hours..but if she is still going in the house during the day I'd start taking her out every 3 hours. I'd also take her to see a vet and make sure she is health and free of any urine infections. <br>  <br>  She is a small breed , it's just going to take some time. Keep being consistent. When she goes outside lots of praise and maybe even some treats. When she goes inside and you catch her say no and take her back out again. <br>  <br>  You can also check out this link with more info on potty training<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/dog-care/dog-care-house-training-puppies-and-dogs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/dog-care/d...</a>|`|be58a957ec05b08ab61416f8ea457867aa	As a couple of others wrote, small breeds need to eliminate more frequently than larger dogs. At 5 months she probably needs to go every 3-4 hours during the day, so take her out at least that often. When she goes outside immediately praise her and give her a small treat. Crate her any time you aren't able to supervise her so that she won't have an accident.<br>  <br>  Punishment does not work with housetraining so don't use it.<br>  <br>  I would not expect a toy breed to be houestrained any earlier than 1 year of age.<br>  <br>  And, btw, it's shih tzu.|`|KmC0K59taa	We had Chihuahuas growing up.  Remember that tiny dogs have tiny bladders.  The dogs we had were never totally housebroke.  They would pee from excitement too.<br>  <br>  I just got a Golden Retriever and we are crate training her.  She has no accidents while in the crate and after the second day she goes pee as soon as she is in the backyard.<br>  <br>  Make sure your dog is peeing while she is out.  You might have to stand there 10 or 15 mins.  Take her out every 30 mins or so when you are home.  She needs to learn that outside is for potty.<br>  <br>  Chihuahuas are cute and lovable, but be prepared to clean up pee!  That is why I chose a larger breed of dog.

M3jRtq2Aaa	Is your dog bleeding?  Just apply direct pressure until it stops and then get some antibiotics from the vet for him.<br>  Is the other dog hurt badly?  He will need to get some antibiotics too or possibly some stitches if it is bad.  I hope they are both vaccinated.<br>  <br>  Things like this happen.  Don't let dogs run loose.  If both were running loose then it is everyone's fault not just your family's problem. You do want to make sure that he isn't always dog aggressive and never people aggressive.  It is possible they were just playing and not fighting. If they do fight, you want to keep them apart so neither will be injured.|`|nv1zVID4aa	If your dog had access to your neighbor's dog, then the law has probability that your dog bit the other dog.

I'd chain him up or built a kennel area.|`|0fsQdoZSaa	If your dog in fact bit the other dog and "drew tons of blood," your dog would have blood on him.  Also, if your dog was out of your house or yard during the time in question, then its a possibility.|`|9261w62Jaa	Well, if nobody saw it happen then they cant blame it on your dog, just because he is the biggest. Talk to the owners about it. If they sew you for it, you would win, because nobody saw it. Good luck|`|AA10698995	I would say he didn't bite the dog. You would of seen blood on your dog if he had drawn "tons" of blood as you say.   Just because you have the other larger breed in your area doesn't mean that a stray didn't come and do it or someone else's dog didn't do it.  Unless there is proof that your dog bit the other dog, you don't have anything to worry about.|`|GpiRaSvPaa	I dont know?? If no one saw anything and your dog has no blood on it, I dont think there is any way to know for sure. It doesnt sound like it was your dog, I would think he would atleast have some blood on him.

VTUdMfR5aa	For some lizards, walnut shells are too rough (just try walking on them yourself 24/7). Even though walnut shells look attractive as a substrate - seeing a necropsy of a bearded dragon impacted from those shells was enough for me to discourage folks from using them. <br>  <br>  We recommend using seeds as substrate. You heard right - seeds, like the birds eat (millet or flax work well) - smooth and safely edible!!! Just don't use sunflower seeds - the shells can cause problems if eaten. We buy 50lb sacks at the co-op for a reasonable price (less than the shells).<br>  <br>  If his feet look irritated, give him soaks with warm water and a few drops of mineral oil mixed in. Mineral oil can also be wiped onto his feet if shedding skin is stubborn to peel off. You can use neosporin or any triple antibiotic ointment if he has cuts. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|5kFocucvaa	You mention he is not used to being handled-  does he walk on carpet or rugs?<br>  <br>  I've rescued iguana's who were losing toes due to carpet fibers wrapping in their scales and causing infections, interfering with shedding.  It could be that he gets down, or you let him run around, and the carpet fibers are getting on his toes.  The only solutions for that are to keep him off the carpet - get a harness and take him out when it's warm and sunny, or only hold him in the Bathroom (NOT in the kitchen, that creates health risks) or where you have wood or tile floors.<br>  <br>  If his cage has any wire on it, or a wire top, it could be he is cutting his feet on that.  I adopted an iguana from a divorced couple (I felt so bad for her - like the child that neither parent wanted!) who had chickenwire on the front of her cage; she got stressed, tried to claw her way out and cut her toes off, almost half of them before I got her and rebuilt it with Plexiglass (with air holes drilled, of course).<br>  <br>  I love Tegu's but never had one (they're not a beginner pet so don't usually need rescuing).  I saw the picture, he is beautiful and you sound like a caring owner so I hope you get a solution.|`|FTpy9M8raa	might be the walnut shells ....... try something softer|`|8oPiczbxaa	If the skin on his feed is not coming off you need to get it off, which isn't the easiest thing to do on an animal with claws that will cut you! lol <br>  <br>  You are doing the right thing by soaking him, this will help remove the skin.  If you can try using a cotton but/ Q tip to GENTLY remove the skin, but read the animal, if he gets nasty, its because it hurts, leave him alon and get to a vets. i have heard of lizards losing their toes due to skin tightening around them and cutting off the blood sulpply, although the do ok with a toe or too missing its obviously not a nice thing for them.  <br>  <br>  Pics would help, jodi_101uk@hotmail.com if you want to send them<br>  <br>  If the lizard is having trouble shedding, then i suggest you increase the humidity in the tank.<br>  <br>  Oh and just my opinion, please don't use a harness, i can't see how any lizard would find this enjoyable and have seen some nasty wounds caused by them, usually to iguanas, but it could do the same to a tegu|`|aR8UsvoTaa	yeah i almost can gurantee he is not shedding right <br>   cuz what happens is if its not moist enough the skin wont shed off the feet and it will constrict cuasing damage or loss of the toe<br>  and he may be irratated and biting at his feet
nMe35c9Aaa	as the first person said they will not even let you buy the monkey if you do not have ALL of these things ready for it. also you have to take education classes for it. so really if he wanted it and did all of these things and put in the time and effort why shouldn't he be able to have it? <br>  but i wouldn't worry to much there is a bill going to congress or wherever right now that permit regular people from owning primates due to that monkey attack a few weeks ago. and from what i have heard it seems pretty likely that it will pass. when they got the petition signed it was like 350 to 125 so it seems most people are in the favor of people not being able to have them as pets. so don't worry i'm sure this will happen before your friends goes threw the process of getting the monkey.|`|wnnudNp5aa	Take him to a monkey house at a zoo. If the stench doesn't get him to change his mind, nothing will!<br>  My first husband had to get one, too. It was horrible. The little thing was an absolute monster. It bit, and pooped all over. It made my life miserable. I actually wound up leaving him before it finally died. <br>  People have no business getting pets they aren't equipped or experienced enough to care for.<br>  One possibility. Get your friend a book about keeping monkeys as pets, maybe once he reads about all the work that's required, he'll lose interest. <br>  BTW, most girls find pet monkeys to be a turn-off!|`|dNEQmJ6Iaa	The US House just passed a bill to outlaw the ownership of primates by private individuals in this country. The bill now goes to the Senate. Another restriction slapped on Americans by an increasingly authoritarian state.|`|3oCYsQhuaa	Ask him to imagine his room, his house, his possesions all completely trashed ....... because thats what a monkey will do, on the loose inside a house!|`|Qeu7mppwaa	Do some research on all the bad things monkies do. Like focus on all the cleaning and training and how much time a monkey would take out of his life.|`|fAVOsdMjaa	tell him monkeys are dangerous, look up articles on the internet.. such as how one ripped off a womens face.. theres many more than that|`|Z8AhDCWEaa	well, first of all, he can't even buy a monkey unless he has all of these things.  You can find out who he is going to try to solicit, and let them know his lack of experience; they might not sell to him if they think the animal will have a bad home.|`|9p7eUgYqaa	Tell him it legal to keep exotic critters in the united states or what ever country you live in. And also the monkey might have been a wild monkey and that  wild monkeys might have a disease like yellow fever that if he get yellow fever tell him it contagious and he could die from that disease if he dose not go to the hospital.
cY8DgJv5aa	Who's Kurt?<br>  <br>  As for the bird that he fancies..... who knows why he loves them?  He just does.  I love dogs.  I have my reasons.  I'm sure he has his reasons for loving pigeons (or whatever).<br>  <br>  *I'm assuming this is some kind of troll question, but that's still my answer.
FG5NbqO0aa	The whole neighborhood threw a party for my dog when he turned one, and it was awesome. First off, get people together! Invite them, and then you'll be able to plan from there. For Zen's I made a Dog Birthday Cake, using a safe recipe I found on the internet, and a Human cake--German Chocolate (Just make sure the two don't cross!). We all gathered at the park, and someone brought Frosty Paws- which is ultimately dog ice cream. All the dogs got to run and play, eat their special cake, and we even had a frosty paws eating contest. (Our neighbor's dog ate it the fastest). Zen also got presents, and toys from everyone. It may sound crazy, but if your dog is your kid, it's going to be as fun, if not more fun then a child's birthday party.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	While we just did simple cake and gifts, you may benefit by using search for questions at the top of the page.  This question has been asked many times before, and some people had some very interesting party ideas, and games and stuff.  Have fun.|`|bI7wMCJXaa	Your dog is a dog and couldn't care less about her birthday or having a birthday party. if you want to give her a treat give her a chicken leg quarter for supper. Anything else is humanizing your dog.|`|1H0vYaJxaa	you can give the animal dog ice cream and dog cake go to a specialty pet store and they will have all that stuff. But to be honest dogs don't care Just save your money.|`|BO28Mn8haa	i'd invite all her doggie friends and give them a play date. treats and maybe a dog friendly cake.|`|AA10500537	make her a vanilla cupcake  and  enjoy it|`|f5e77b5c7067c9a50f9b069d33657c40aa	never tried that.|`|chdtVwhFaa	ABSOLUTELY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  We gave our litter of puppies their first birthday party.  We invited all the puppies together at a friend's house to make sure they didn't forget each other. It was great. We had happy first birthday hats, natural healthy dog treats, etc., and had a "human" cookout for the people.  I totally understand and it's a great idea. Have fun.|`|KfKr3hUmaa	Doggie Ice Cream. You can make it with grinded ice and peanut butter|`|XIH2oKtJaa	oh. my. gosh.
JrnXCy49aa	Depending on the other dog's breeds, this dog may need outside more than they do. No wonder the poor thing's howling, I would too. Introduce them to each other gradually, and remember they have to work out their own heirarchy, it's not up to you to pick who backs down to wqho. If there is wolf in the dog, don't try and make him do stuff, he'll show you just how dominant he can get over you. Scruff of the neck's a bad idea there as it won't work. It can work if there is no wolf in him though.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  If there is wolf in him, forget about dominating him, friend of mine had a partial wolf, and it would try and attack me, being female, if I wasn't inline immediately. It does not behave like any dog. I had a White GSD, they also have yellow eyes.<br>  If he's sweet, chances are minimal that there's wolf in him, even a small % of wolf makes them almost wild. And they won't listen to a female at all, ever, it's not how they work plain and simple.|`|77412bb9d7b8758e0a32f247da6eaed4aa	Hate to say it, but you should have made sure the dogs got along before adopting.  That being said...  the only way to make this work is for you to be alpha.  unacceptable behavior gets him put on his back by the scruff.|`|7CY98xGJaa	Motherbe... is right, only some breeds of dogs (chows being one) and some dogs due to their personality simply do not get along with other dogs.  I would  follow Motherbe...'s advice and firmly establish myself as the unquestionable alpha "male" over the course of a month at most.  Don't leave the 3 dogs alone together until you are absolutely sure that there will be no bloodshed.  Then be very cautious in doing so.  Do it gradually and stay near enough so that if there is a fight you'll be able to break it up quickly.  If the dog is still aggressive towards your other 2 dogs at this point I'm afraid You'll have to find him another home or risk coming home one day to find it a bloody battlefield.  And I know you don't want that to happen...as you said, they're a part of the family.  I wish you luck.     Thumper_2<br>  <br>  P.S.  You should check out "The Dog Whisperer" on the "Animal Planet" channel.  This guy is amazing!  I believe he has a website also.  You might be able to get some help/advice there as well.|`|hRiBrjXpaa	If the dog is indeed part wolf (most dogs in shelters get this connotation but aren't really part wolf - makes them sound more appealing to some people), you have now opened your home to an untrainable wild animal. Why would you adopt this thing in the first place? You are only contributing to the cycle of breeding hydbrid animals that are miserable because they don't quite fit in anywhere. <br>  <br>  If he is howling, he is doing what he naturally does. Perhaps you should rethink adopting this particular dog. He needs to be in the hands of an owner that can deal with his wild side.
ZJ4IQP5iaa	Dogs feel the cold too, even if they are bundled up in a doggy sweater and slippers.<br>  <br>  The clothing itself may inhibit the dog and keep it from playing. My dog HATES having anything put on him. If we tried to put a sweater on him he would shake and tear and cry until finally giving up and laying down until we took it off. <br>  <br>  My dog also won't play outside or potty (unless he really needs to go) in 20 below weather. He'll just sit on the steps by our door until we let him in.<br>  <br>  A good way to get excersise inside--if you have room--is to throw a toy across a room and get the puppy to fetch it back to you. Chasing a puppy around a room can be fun too, as long as you don't scare the puppy. <br>  <br>  Tug-o-war with a rope or chew toy can also give your puppy a lot of excersise, too.<br>  <br>  If you have a puppy the best way to handle them is to be with them. Go outside and play with them if you want them to get excersise. No matter the weather go outside with them when they have to potty (at least until they're older). <br>  <br>  Dogs tend to get in trouble--chase deer, cats, dig holes, etc.--unless their owners go outside with them.<br>  <br>  Dogs who will stay in the yard and not wander tend to not get a lot of excersise because they get bored. The best excersise for them is to play or walk with them.|`|Z8AhDCWEaa	aww..how cute!  Some good ways to get a dog running around is to play a game of chase with each other.  You can steal a toy, or let one of the pups 'steal' it, and chase each other around the living room. <br>  Playing fetch inside the house is also lots of fun.|`|1H0vYaJxaa	You are the owner so take the dog outside.|`|PhYHZCy4aa	awww. i have 2 jack russell terriors also.<br>  one's a girl who is turning 7 tomorrow and the other's a boy who is 4.<br>  but all jrt are different. <br>  My dog loves baths she loves water..<br>  but my other dog he hates water..<br>  but to answer your Q, I would just say to take it off her and then try going outside.. I have a sweater for my dog too, but it's like a coat, and since dogs have fur maybe they always don't like it..<br>  so try picking them up and taking them outside for walks,<br>  and not wearing the sweater.. see what happens then..<br>  : )|`|AoSeHXeQaa	I wouldnt want to go outside if its that cold, either :o)<br>  <br>  Do you have a treadmill?  You can teach your dogs to run on the treadmill.  <br>  <br>  Two of my dogs are very high energy dogs, and walking is not enough for them, so I also put them on the treadmill.|`|S5Lz35myaa	Sorry, but dog ownership is not just a fair weather venture. You need to put her on a leash and go outside with her.  She will learn that the sooner she goes potty, the sooner she can get back in the house!|`|qapJU3tMaa	Just so you know, it's JACK RUSSELL TERRIER.  No excuse for the dogs not going outside to EXERCISE.|`|4444d48004267fc3c148eb176ef253d8aa	Jack Russels have thin coats and get cold easily, but if that breed doesn't expend its energy you might see behavioral problems.  Teach your dogs to associate going out in the cold with something positive.  Pick out some favorite treats like the little liver kinds, and put them on your pocket.  Get out the leash and give tiny bits to entice them out for a walk.  Continue giving small pieces (not whole) of treats every block or so.  After time goes by and they develop a good attitude about walks, cut back on the amount of treats you give, maybe eventually down to one at the beginning and one after.  You also might want to limit these special treats for just training; don't just dish them out all the time or you're taking away the exciting special factor.<br>  <br>  This also works well for cooperation with baths and nail trims.|`|chdtVwhFaa	I have 4 Lhasa Apsos and they are the same way.  I go outside and freeze with them when they go potty, makes it easier for them.  They won't go off the porch unless I'm there or my husband is.|`|332cfccb16c421b75af99e1e18ff7b45aa	if you have a treadmill you can use that to exercise them one at a time... the trick is to get them feeling secure on the treadmill... Use treats to get them to get on it and keep them on it by keeping a short leash and giving treats.Remember though ONE AT A TIME<br>  Another thing you can do is make them sit  and stay and "hide" a treat where they see you put a treat down and when you release the dog it gets the treat. then once they get the concept you can truly hide the treat and ask them to go find it... This is a great game as it engages their minds as well as gives them exercise... IF you are really motivated you can then teach them to find your car keys by encouraging the dog to pick up your keys and word association and then starting the process over. you can also play hide and seek by aking the dogs sit or down stay and going to another room and calling them and having treats with you ready for when they get to you. this is a great recall exercise and so if they ever get loose they will be more liable to come straight to you for a treat when you call them
muPiBQ3Uaa	Sorry, but Labrador + Poodle = Mutt. No such things as a "Labradoodle." <br>  <br>  The determination of the breed is reliant upon the pure line breed of the sire.<br>  If the sire is a Labrador, and the dam is a Poodle, the resultant offspring are "Labrador Mixes".<br>  If the sire is a Poodle, and the dam is a Labrador, the resultant offspring are "Poodle Mixes".<br>  That is how it is in the real dog world.<br>  <br>  The whole idiotic "designer" mutt names thing is so tremendously ridiculous. All the so-called "breeder" is doing is trying to make money from the ignorant and gullible by selling their bastardized mutts that were the result of not enough supervision of their dog, so it got out and became knocked-up.<br>  <br>  The whole thing is akin to putting Ford fenders on a Chevrolet, calling the result a "Chevord", and saying that it is a better car than the two it was constructed from. Anyone doing that would be laughed out of the country. It is time for all the "designer breeders" to have the same response to their fraudulent claims about their supposed "hybrids".<br>  <br>  Our $.02|`|RN1wGlWWaa	They are MUTTS - not a breed and people use whatever they want to make an expensive mutt to sell to people.  Since there is no standard, no one cares what they breed and you are only lining the pockets of backyard breeders and puppy mills if you buy one.|`|bIaywrBCaa	Mutts, mixed breeds should be $50-$100, no more.

Why pay dishonest people for their unscrupulous breeding practices?|`|aCqSF87Raa	There is no such thing - sorry, but no matter how many people are doing it and how much hype there is about it i will not consider a "mutt" a breed until the AKC says so. And they never will (at least in our lifetime) simply because these dogs do not breed true and you CANNOT predict or create a breed standard.<br>  <br>  That being said you are looking to buy a mutt. There are very few "breeders" of these dogs that do proper health checks or genetic screenings, behavior evaluations, breed at the proper age and the appropriate amount of times, or provide health guarantees and so forth. Simply because these dogs are "in" and people want to make money.<br>  <br>  If you want a "Labradoodle" then adopt one from the shelter - you get the same dog and probably the same quality, just for less money AND you don't support irresponsible breeding of these dogs.<br>  <br>  PS - They are NOT hypoallergenic OR non-shedding. There is only a 50/50 chance of puppies inheriting those traits from the Poodle.|`|kqa9VFrfaa	They use standard poodles for this.<br>   In my opinion these dogs are way over priced. Some genius found out a way to make a quick buck for a mutt.<br>  There are purebreds already in existence for every known use of a dog already. Standard poodles have good personalities, and if I were spending big bucks on a dog I would go for a real poodle than spring for a mixed breed. Then again if U R not handy with clippers go for the lab. These are both lovable breeds. U can get either one cheaper than the crossbred.|`|Bw18seFqaa	its a mutt.. you shouldnt pay no more than what the local shelter charges for an adoption fee..   any more than that is too much.<br>  <br>  All sizes of poodle may be used.. thats no guarantee tho of what size the mix will end up being... even if you use a toy poodle, you could still end up with a large dog.|`|AA12377116	They are mutts. You can find one at any shelter, any rescue group.<br>  <br>  Don't perpetuate this stupid, cruel and waste of animal life by buying these designer breeds.|`|FG5NbqO0aa	Truthfully Labradoodles are just mutts. And very expensive ones at that. the running average I've found is $950, the highest is $1700. <br>  <br>  A Labradoodle is a very smart mixed breed, because both the poodle and the Lab are intelligent, but they have an insanely high prey drive. Lab's were bred to retrieve, and Poodles too- therefore this combination can become easily fixated on small animals. I wouldn't recommend it either, as both breeds are prone to hip displaysia, but I suppose when properly bred, they can be okay. If you want a mutt though- go to a shelter. There's tons of mutts there, and who knows your mutt might become the next big "thing". Good luck!|`|USoSsng6aa	Poodles. Labrador + Poodle = "Labradoodle".<br>  <br>  Personally, I don't think you should get one, they tend to have health problems, for starters, secondly, they usually come from disreputable places, like puppy mills, since "designer dogs" are so popular, people just crank them out and out and charge a huge price for what is, honestly, a mutt dog. They usually cost hundreds of dollars.<br>  <br>  You'd be far, far better off adopting a pet from your local pet rescue groups. Not only are they cheaper, but you'll be saving an animal's life instead of contributing to an overall problem. :)|`|MSKS4h1Iaa	Okay, why does it have to be a "labradoodle?"

You're just asking for a dog with health problems, and they charge ridiculous amounts of money for mutts, generally $400-600.<br>  Please listen to Shofie's advice.  <br>  Mixed breeds can be some of the best dogs, but get them from a rescue group or animal shelter.  You'll be saving a life, and the people there will try to help you find the right personality match for your family.  Buying from pet stores only supports the abuse and neglect of puppy mills.  Most backyard breeders are no better.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't rule out adult dogs either.  Puppies aren't all they're cracked up to be.  You can skip the potty training, chewing, and mouthing periods (sometimes) and you will already know what their personality will be like.  A lot of rescued dogs seem to really appreciate getting a loving home.|`|b0ljuH6Qaa	They mix them with a basic poodle.But they are very expensive and can cost from $300-$1,000!
MKuDawP7aa	You have to first determine the problem before you apply any medication to your fish. While some diseases have symptoms that look similar, they need different treatments obviously. A good practise would be to keep a small quarantine tank on standby, in case you need it to treat your sick fish. Not all fishes are affected at the same time, so you need to separate the sick one from the rest as quickly as possible. Another good practise is to keep common medications handy, so that you can apply them as <br>  and when you need to. Take care not to overstock and do check their expiry dates from time to time.<br>  <br>  Here are some common fish diseases/problems. Learn to recognise these symptoms.<br>  <br>  1. Ammonia poisoning. Fish are seen gasping for air at the surface of the water. This usually happens for a new tank setup. It's part of the nitrogen cycle during which ammonia is converted into nitrates. Most fishes do not survive during the initial stage.<br>  <br>  Remedy: When you are first setting up your aquarium, run the pump and put in cheaper fishes to start the cycle. Another alternative is to put in fish food and allow it to decompose to produce ammonia gas. The whole procedure should take at least 2 weeks. Once the nitrate level in the water is safe, you can then put in your fish.<br>  <br>  2. Lack of oxygen. Fish are seen gasping for air at the surface.<br>  <br>  Remedy: This can be easily rectified by adding an air pump to the tank.<br>  <br>  For more information on setting up a new tank, go here.<br>  <br>  3. Fish fungus. White or dirty white cotton-like growth on the skin. When left untreated, the fish will die.<br>  <br>  Remedy: Change your water every other day. If the situation does not improve, it is best to quarantine the sick fish and treat it individually. There are many ready-made fungus treatments in the market. Just shop around and ask for the right one.<br>  <br>  4. Tail and/or fin rot. Obvious signs are rotting fins and blood on the edges of fins. This is usually caused by bullying fishes and/or poor water conditions. Tuberculosis can also lead to tail and fin rot.<br>  <br>  Remedy: If it is caused by a bullying fish, separate them and treat it with antibiotics (chloromycetin). If it is caused by poor water conditions, change the aquarium water frequently.<br>  <br>  5. Velvet. They appear as yellow or brown dusty spots on the fish. The fish may show signs of irritation and may be rubbing on surfaces in the tank.<br>  <br>  Remedy: Quarantine the fish because Velvet is highly infectious. Treat it with copper at 0.2 mg per litre. Repeat once every few days if needed. Do not prolong the treatment as copper can cause fish poisoning.<br>  <br>  6. Ich or White Spot (Ichthyophtirius multifiliis). It appear as white spots on the body. It is usually caused by poor water quality.<br>  <br>  Remedy: You can head down to the pet shop and get a remedy for it. To help in the treatment, raise the temperature of water to 27oC (80o F) to speed up the cycle time of this protozoa (Ichthyophtirius multifiliis).|`|1gXo8oHtaa	email me and give me more info like what type it is, what do you have it contained in, etc.. my mom is a vet so i should be able to help you<br>  Animadora16xox@yahoo.com|`|njkxZGz6aa	what exactly is wrong with the fish? you can email me and ill try and help<br>  <br>  snydergirl2009@yahoo.com|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	Vets don't treat fish. <br>  <br>  How is your fish sick?

MKuDawP7aa	Discus Diseases and Medications<br>  Posted on Feb 24, 2009 under Diseases Medication | No Comment · Edit <br>  Discus Diseases and Medications<br>  <br>  One thing I have learnt by keeping Discus is that they don’t usually just die for “no reason”. In most cases there is some sign that something is wrong. When I ignored these signs, I lost precious fish. Some of the diseases and parasites I have encountered are described below.<br>  Hole in the Head Syndrome<br>  <br>  This is a disease often associated with Discus, but it also affects Geophagus species, Uaru amphiacanthoides and Astronotus ocellatus. If treated correctly it need not be a problem. I left untreated, it can cause permanent scarring and even death. The most important treatment is heat treatment. Over a couple of days raise the temperature from 30C to 36C. Additional aeration will be required to ensure adequate oxygen supply. This temperature must be maintained for 8 to 10 days for full recovery, however, the temperature must be dropped if the fish goes into stress. In addition to heat, the fish can be given Flagyl (Metronidazole) orally once every three days for the duration of the heat treatment. See next paragraph for the method.<br>  Internal parasites<br>  <br>  Internal parasites in the gut can be assumed, if the fish becomes emaciated or produces white, jelly-like faeces. I have no idea of what species of parasites are infecting our fish, but in most cases heat treatment (as for Hole-In-The-Head Syndrome) and Flagyl given orally cures the fish. To treat the fish, assuming the fish is still eating, soak some live blood worms or black mosquito larvae in a solution of 10 ml of liquid Flagyl to 200 ml of water for about one hour. Then feed the worms or wrigglers to the fish. This treatment can be repeated every 2 to 3 days for 10 days. If the fish is not eating, then the job is a little more difficult. I have had success by removing the fish from the water and placing it on a wet towel and injecting (using a syringe without needle) the medication down its throat. I use a 2 ml syringe and a mixture of 1 part liquid Flagyl, 2 parts of Liquifry (to try and get the fish’s strength up) and 3 parts water. Before returning the fish to the tank wait for the fish to swallow. It is normal for excess medication to be expelled from the fishes gills and mouth. This treatment can be done twice a day, until the fish shows signs of recovery. The treatment of non-eating fish is not always successful.<br>  External parasites<br>  <br>  External parasites come in many types and I am unsure of exact species. However, I have found by symptoms, that there are differences and different medications are required. Basically I have two main medications for use for external parasites.<br>  <br>  * Jungle Labs Parasite clear which I use for fish that are scratching themselves on objects in the tank. I believe this to be skin fluke and use this drug for anything I feel requires mild treatment. Dosage is one tablet for every 40 litres of tank water, repeating two weeks thereafter.<br>  Gill fluke<br>  <br>  Gill fluke is a common disease in Discus and is worth mentioning separately to other external parasites. In adult Discus, it is usually associated with heavy breathing, however, in fry it causes much greater problems. When young Discus get to around 10 cent piece size, gill fluke may become a problem. The parents carry gill flukes in small amounts all the time and if the parents are left with the babies too long, after free-swimming, then the parents can pass them on to the babies. The classic symptoms are heavy breathing, and erratic swimming as though the fish has been bitten on the gill by something inside. This can be accompanied by a spasm and sudden paralysis resulting in the fish sinking motionless to the bottom. This condition seems to be brought on by overcrowding and high feeding rates associated with raising the fry, and can be avoided sometimes by spreading the fry out as they grow.<br>  Bacterial infections<br>  <br>  Bacterial infections can strike Discus the same as any other fish and I have found that two medications are good.<br>  <br>  * The best is Chloromycetin and comes in powder form. The dosage is one teaspoon to 100 litres of water. It is always fast acting and some improvement should be noticed in 8 hours if it is going to work for that condition. A second dose after two days may be needed, but there is no need to remove the previous dose as it dissipates out after 12 hours. It is important to store Chloromycetin absolutely dry and away from light.<br>  <br>  * The other medication is Oxolinic Acid. A stock solution of half a gram of the powder in 500 ml of de-ionised water can be made up and stored. The dosage is 1 ml of the stock solution to 10 litres of tank water. This treatment is only effective on some types of infections.<br>  White Spot and Velvet Disease<br>  <br>  These two diseases are rare in Discus due to the high water temperature (30°C) they are kept at. But if you do happen to get these parasites then heat treatment will cure it without|`|QrjjiOgTaa	what fish and what symptoms?|`|AA11901352	Cuckes are not a cure for anything and won't just make your fish feel better.  Unless you can explain some of the symptoms there is no way we can help since it could be as simple as you are keeping them in the wrong temperature of water, you haven't done a water change to ich.  We need to know what is the problem and what type of fish in order to help.

Rw7gi86Naa	That depends on many things...<br>  - First of all, cats that live indoors live longer, healthier lives. Statistically, the life span of an indoor cat averages twelve to fourteen years, whereas it is only about four years for the outdoor cat. <br>  - Cats need plenty of exercise to stay healthy, (just like us). So play with your cat each day for at least 15 minutes. Find new games, and new toys to keep her interested. If you can't afford expensive toys from the pet store, use your imagination and make your own. Cats love paper bags, cardboard boxes, crumpled up pieces of paper, just to name a few. This will not only strengthen your bond together, but it will keep her active and healthy.<br>  - Your cat should have regular vet check-ups and stay up-to-date on all necessary vaccinations.<br>  - Stress is a major factor which can not only make your cat miserable, but it also can weaken the immune system. Weaker immune system = a sick, unhappy cat. Punishment is a big no-no for cats. If you get mad and yell in your cats face, it will accomplish nothing except your cat will be angry and scared of you. It's not about punishing "bad behavior," it's all about teaching good behavior. You should never “spank” or use your hands in any way to cause pain to your cat. This will only stress her out and cause her to fear you. Our cats should associate our hands with pleasant things like petting, feeding and love, not violence. Stress-free cat = happy, healthy cat.<br>  - Spaying/neutering not only prevents unwanted animals from being euthanized, but it helps your pet avoid future behavioral and health problems. For more information on this subject, please visit this link: <a href="http://www.sniksnak.com/benefits.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sniksnak.com/benefits.html</a> <br>  - What kind of food you feed them also greatly affects their long-term health. Stay away from supermarket brands, as they are loaded with artificial preservatives, flavors and colors. Some say that wet food is best, but I think a combination of wet food and dry food is fine. Stick with the premium brands. An occasional small chunk of meat is fine for a treat but, no table scraps. A cat regularly fed human food will either lose his taste for his own food, or be too full to eat it. Either way, he will lose the essential nutrients, including taurine, which are necessary for cats to survive and thrive. Even the water your cat drinks is important. Tap water is not healthy for cats because it has metals and other contaminants in it. Distilled water or natural spring water is best.<br>  - The lifespan of your cat can also vary from breed to breed. Also, you can take the cat’s genes into consideration. If her parents lived to be 20, then her future is looking bright.|`|f2ebcc6f8692252ee4077de8f0b301a9aa	I agree..typical is 12-20 for a indoor cat..I did a LOT of research before I got my cats, they r sisters and 2 yrs old now, they get NO table food at all and go to the vet twice a year.

4aAhEK9daa	No one can diagnose your cat online.  If you can't afford to properly care for a cat when it has health issues why do you have FIVE cats?  Perhaps you should rehome some of these cats so you can give the ones you have the care they need - not wait YEARS to have an issue looked at.  It could be anything from allergies to a clogged tear duct to a chronic eye infection.  A RESPONSIBLE pet owner would have it looked at.|`|AA11457471	Don't try home remedies on an eye. You could do some real damage!<br>  Trust me on this one.<br>  <br>  Your details imply that you aren't going to take him to the vet unless it's "fatal or really important".<br>  Well, if your cat's been like that several years I'm sure it's not fatal.<br>  <br>  Important? To you or your cat?<br>  If your cat could speak I'm sure he'd ask what's taken so long.<br>  <br>  I don't understand why you'd take in five cats when you can't afford one trip to the vet.<br>  It just makes no sense....|`|1H0vYaJxaa	It sounds as if the cat is playing and hits himself in the eye. Does your cat keep the eye closed for a few days and then he seems fine? My cat does that all the time. All I do (mind you I did take him to the vet and after 75.00 they told me that penny was fine) is take a wash cloth and clean the eye with some cool water unless if it is caked up then warm water. There is not much you can do just watch the animal play and you may be surprised to find out that s/he is doing it to its self. Now if the eye starts to look dry then you will need to take him to the vet because that means the eye has died and will need to be removed. Same thing if they eye is twice or three times the size as the other one.
Ktuf0On2aa	Ciao, allora, il criceto dorato può essere un animale mordace, ed i suoi incisivi affondano abbastanza da farti sanguinare, ma il morso è veloce e non fa troppo male. Sulle razze nane, so che alcuni si fanno maneggiare facilmente, altri mordicchiano. Io avevo i dorati anni fa, e di morso ne ricordo solo uno, dato da una criceta che avevo maneggiato male e che non era ancora troppo abituata a stare in mano.<br>  Se lo prendi adulto ed è mordace, molto difficilmente cambierà carattere, o cmq anche se non lo fosse, facilmente resterebbe selvatico, prendilo abbastanza giovane, e abitualo gradualmente alla tua presenza. Attenzione, i primi tempi potrebbe mordere anche perchè non si rende conto di cosa sono le tue dita, evita di infilarle nella gabbia e attento se gli offri qualcosa da mangiare. Comunque ci sono dei siti che offrono gratis criceti che la gente non vuol più tenere, o magari non ha spazio per la cucciolata inaspettata, chi li ospita ti dovrebbe saper dire il carattere di ogni esemplare.|`|4Msi55gkaa	Anch'io ho avuto un criceto... si chiamava Manolo... sai x l'abilità nell'arrampicarsi...<br>  <br>  Tutti gli animali, se si senton in pericolo, diventano aggressivi e il criceto morde... ma è come un pizzicotto fatto con le unghie... non muori mica x un morso...<br>  Il mio mi ha morso una volta xchè l'ho stretto un pò troppo, ma mi stava cadendo... lì però è stata colpa mia...<br>  Io l'ho abituato a tenerlo fuori ogni tanto e me lo mettevo sulla pancia o sulla spalla e lui zompettava di qua e di la....<br>  <br>  <br>  Ma ricordati, un animale è soprattutto un essere vivente e richiede attenzione, amore e cure.

Yeah, right.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|9gmGhJ5Aaa	This is just my opinion, but it looks like a scam.....I wouldn't buy it.  Go to a local pet store and buy a book there if you want info on dog food, or one of the employees can help you out.   good luck.
AA10029366	No.<br>  <br>  The Siberian was bred to be an endurance sled dog. They were not bred to protect or guard anything/anyone. They were bred to be passed from sled team to sled team, which is why they like everyone. They don't care who their owner is, as long as they are with other dogs and working.<br>  <br>  No well-bred Siberian should EVER be aggressive toward a human being. Anyone thinking they can/should be a guard dog is mistaken.<br>  <br>  They would likely (and SHOULD) fail evaluation for protection training.|`|kqa9VFrfaa	The answer is simply NO. Most dogs need a little training for this. Huskies are wonderful dogs, but not known as guard dogs. A German shepherd would be much better for this. Even a dog from the working group needs guidance. Obedience training is the first step.  If U go to a professional trainer be very careful. Do not pay a lot of money unless U know what U R getting into. A lot of trainers in this area of protection are rip offs. U should never turn your dog over to someone else sight unseen. A reliable trainer includes U in every phase of the training. <br>  The best guard dogs are sometimes smaller dogs that work as a team. Also people do not realize that the best guard dogs should be VERY friendly as puppies, because a fear bitter is NOT reliable when the chips are down. Please read up on this subject.|`|Z8AhDCWEaa	Some dog breeds will. I had a husky/german shepherd mix, and he was always watching out for us, even when we didn't know it.  He would guard our property from strangers until he saw that they were okay, and would also protect us when we were camping out in a tent, but that might have just been the german shepherd in him. Regardless, I know that if anyone really attacked me, he would step in at least a little.|`|AoSeHXeQaa	It just depends on the dog.  I have had two dogs who attacked without training to protect a family member - an American Eskimo, and a collie.  Neither one a breed you would expect to attack :o)<br>  <br>  I would prefer to have a dog who just LOOKS scary, myself. <br>  I had a 120 lb. Rottweiler who would not hurt a fly, but strangers did not come into the yard without checking with me, first.  <br>  That was just fine with me.|`|84558de0349fa374ed3605ac33e8e36daa	I don't know about Huskies but I have an Aussie and she would definitely defend us. And she hasn't been trained for that. One time my husband and I stood at the end of the hallway and there is a mirror at the other end (it doesn't go all the way to the floor) My dog saw my husband moving around in the mirror and thought it was somebody else. She instantly put herself in front of us and barked to alarm us. When I started moving forward, she moved with me, making sure I stayed behind her. She is very smart. My mother in law has a dachshund and he tries to defend her too. He's actually a little too much cuz he won't let anybody near her...|`|020573c2b8f6f31da5d9ac91c3b09ee6aa	i know my ridge back/mastiff would. he's proven himself on 3 seperate occassions.<br>  but my malamute/wolf mix WOULD NOT. simply not in the nature of the "beast".|`|JtYNXoRdaa	I'm fairly sure that a Husky would NEVER help you if you were attacked.  They're not bred for protection or guarding and are pretty goofy, fun loving dogs.<br>  <br>  I know there are stories of dogs naturally defending their people, but I think it's more saving THEIR hide than yours.  Plus, I would never expect my dog to do something like that.  It's MY job to protect HER, not the other way around.  <br>  <br>  So no, I do not believe dogs know how to defend naturally, with no training.  Especially not a Husky.  There may be exceptions out there, I don't know, but I wouldn't expect yours to be one.  :-)|`|IQezKzNEaa	Don't bet your life on it.  While some dogs might prove themselves to be very protective of thier owners, don't depend on your untrained dog to get you out of scary situations.  You are probably less at risk by having a big dog with you; you won't look like an easy target.  You are (or should be) the alpha of your pack, and so she is more likely to depend on you for protection than to think she should protect you.|`|XIH2oKtJaa	i always wondered this too. a dog can sense a persons emotions so would probably know when it needed to attack. i don't think you need to train them to do it. i've heard huskies absolutely love people and would sooner lick a person to death, the same with staffies. so i was never sure whether my staffy would protect me. until some freaky old man came over to me and my sister, acting weird. we were both kinda scared and i think lenny sensed this so he barked at the man, who then left. he never barks whilst on a lead so i'm assuming he felt that we were uncomfortable and gave warning at a level he saw fit. now i don't doubt that if a situation arose where he needed to protect us that he would do so within reason. if you do decide to train her then get a professional involved. training a dog to attack can make the dog unpredictable if you don't know what you're doing. hope this helps.|`|jZGg0gNKaa	Huskies are not known at all to be any sort of attack or guard dog. Although they are "scary" looking to most people. Whenever i walk my sibes most people will cross the road to get out of our way. I don't think you need to worry about being attacked. Lets face it these guys look like wolves.|`|MSKS4h1Iaa	Honestly, as much as I'm sure my dog loves me, he would probably run if I was being attacked. He's a pit bull mix, and he's been a little timid of people the entire time I've had him. You can't rely on a dog to save you, unless you do have it protection trained.|`|atXZpthZaa	yes if you have a good bond, and if the dog really likes you.

The vets wanted to dip and pump her full of all kinds of chemicals.  I researched and learned it was her immune system.  I needed to support her immune system, and the problem would take care of itself.  So... after months of research and feeding her all kinds of supplements (like Vit. C, Vit. E, Salmon Oil, etc.)... I finally read about a raw diet.<br>  <br>  After having the dog for 8 months, I watched her problem disappear in 3-4 weeks after starting the raw prey model diet.<br>  <br>  Please consider this...

It's caused by a mite that lives in the animals skin. Usually this mite causes no harm to the animal, but when the animal gets stressed or has a problem with it's immunity- that's when things start to pop up, such as loosing hair, itching, sores, etc. It really depends on how bad a case your animal has. Sometimes it takes a couple of weeks to see a difference, it took my pup about 3mos to really see a difference,but I had to do the Mitaban dips instead of the ivermectin as my puppy has sensitivities to ivermectin. Your animal may take even longer to get well. But keep up the treatments, there is a light at the end of the tunnel, today my pup has no issues with his skin, absolutely no sign of this problem.|`|uEoWZ37Eaa	Here is some good info for you:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dr-dan.com/red.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dr-dan.com/red.htm</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content.plx?P=A&A=1556" rel="nofollow">http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content...</a><br>  <br>  I hope you've been to the vet.

z6d6k1Ltaa	Kittens very frequently have worms or parasites. Yellow, runny poop isn't normal for kittens. Please take it to a vet. Its good of you to try to keep her clean, but the diarrhea & cleanings are irritating her & its painful. The vet can usually get this cleared up & it won't be very expensive. Diarrhea can cause dehydration & inability to absorb nutrients from food & lead to death, so please get your kitten checked. If it has parasites or worms, it won't get better until its treated. It is young & very delicate, so don't buy grocery store dewormers - they are too harsh & may kill it.Please take the kitty to the vet.|`|VurU6Hw5aa	TAKE THE CAT TO THE VET.

dEZEc1E8aa	It certainly wouldn't cure the heartworm, in fact it most likely wouldn't help anything at all.  If your pup has heartworm you need to take it to the vet's office for a rigorous treatment schedule.  Heartworm will kill an otherwise healthy pup quickly & without much warning.|`|27d2fe79dd9df7b907483b0eb75c1a39aa	Its called bleeding out.  The dog can bleed from every orifice.

It will not work if the worms are already there.|`|20lFo07jaa	It depends on what stage the heartworm infection is in.  It takes 6 months for heartworm infection to become mature, which is why heartworm meds are usually dispensed for 6 months at a time.  This is also why it requires a prescription to buy (at least in the US) because your vet is responsible for educating you on the heart worm cycle, and also ensuring that it is safe to give to your pet (ie current testing negative before dispensing).<br>  <br>  If it has mature heart worms, the heart worm preventative can easily kill the dog - the mature heart worms will die and can cause cardiac arrest, anaphylaxis, and valve blockages, among other things.|`|FhdyUQwGaa	depends on the preventative. Ivermectin (heartguard) causes a quick kill of adult worms, which can be fatal to your dog. Selemectin (revolution) doesn't kill adult worms, it kills them in larval stages, so it isn't dangerous to an infected dog, but it also isn't going to CURE the dog.|`|KAVQ3uJIaa	Well it depends on what kind of prevention was given.  For example if you gave a product called Heartguard to a heartworm positive dog the results can be fatal.  If you gave them Interceptor (which in certain doeses can be used to cure heartworm infestations over a period of 1 - 2 years) the dog should be ok.  Either way it is not recommended that you give a dog heartworm prevention without a heartworm test.  Even the use of Interceptor in certain cases could be life threating.  Please consult with your vet prior to giving any medications to a heartworm positive dog.<br>  <br>  Dogs 6 months of age or younger do not need a heartworm test prior to giving the prevention. <br>  <br>  If you are in treatment please remember that Heartworms live in the heart and during heartworm treatment the worms will begin to die.  Dogs have to be kept very calm and inactive at this time.  Leash walking is a must!  If the dogs become overly excited the worms could accidently be introduced into the lungs causing death during treatment.|`|ttWY0vJeaa	Never give a dog heartworm preventative unless it had been tested and found to be clear of heartworms.

sAUS0wxtaa	What the petstore gave you sounds like carefresh. Thats perfectly fine. Gerils love to burrow and because the stuff is fluffy, you can put quite a bit in without wasting and give it something to tunnel under. <br>  <br>  Stay away from cedar as it has a natural chemical that is toxic to small animals. The debate is still out over whether or not pine is safe. I've used it safely on all of my small animals but because nothing is certain as of yet, I use aspen. Its a little more expensive than pine but sheaper than carefersh. It has no chemicals in it and isnt dusty. So as far as shavings, aspen is the safest bet. <br>  <br>  Newspaper is fine but make sure its a soy-based ink. Im pretty sure that most mainstream papers are soy based but Ive also been told to stay away from pages with color on it because they still have a somewhat harmful chemical in them.<br>  <br>  Paper towels are good too but with these and newspaper, neither are good at absorbing odors. I use the aspen and throw in 5 or 6 sheets of paper towels (less if you have a small cage) and let them just tear it up and make their own nests out of it! Its a blast watching htem work.<br>  <br>  So there are a few options out there for you, but ultimately ist up to you and what you prefer. The other nice thing about aspen is that even when its absorbing the odor, as it gets wet you can smell the aspen, not the urine.|`|AA11860101	It would be best to stay away from cedar and pine.

tPGxPDvBaa	Only wash if needed. You can at this age but very carefully & gently.  Use only a PUPPY shampoo & nothing else.  Towel dry well & for a few minutes only you can dry with dryer on the lowest setting - no hot air. Don't allow outdoors til completely dry.|`|AA12377116	I washed mine at 9 weeks, carefully. In the kitchen sink with baby shampoo. No conditioner, no whitening shampoo, nothing but mild tearless shampoo and warm water. Rinse well and, this is the most important thing about grooming a bichon of any age - you must blow the hair dry while brushing until he is all fluffy and you can comb his hair. If you do not do this last part, and let him air dry, or even partially air dry, his hair will matt, he will start gnawing at the "dreadlocks" that form and this will start sores and skin conditions that will bother him for a long time.<br>  <br>  I started bringing my bichon to a groomer at 12 weeks. The sooner the better. Their hair grows amazingly fast at that age and the groomer will train him right away to cooperate. I would suggest only going to a groomer who specializes in bichons. They have double coats and can be tricky to keep up.<br>  <br>  Also, I remember when my male was about 6 months old his baby coat started to fall out and be replaced by the adult coat. It started with the top half of his body so that, about two weeks into the molting he looked like he was wearing a giant tutu. <br>  <br>  Your bichon will start to lose his baby teeth some time around then as well. You probably won't notice it unless you keep an eye on him, you will see some blood on his lips and most puppies eat their baby teeth. Mine spit it out and my hubby actually picked it up off the carpet before he could eat it.  Sentimental fool that he is, he's nuts for our bichons.<br>  <br>  Good luck. Bichons need to be groomed every 4-6 weeks, and I recommend a pet cut rather than the standard bichon cut unless you have enough time every day to devote to the grooming.<br>  <br>  Besides, a groomer will pluck the hair out of the ear canals, expel the anal glands, trim the nails and brush the teeth so it's all worth it.|`|MRE4T3I0aa	I think it is fine to give him a bath , but if its his first time he will probably be nervous because he doesn't know what is going on.

I use a dish detergant on my dog because the vet said too and they said it helps take fleas off . I don't know if you should use it on a puppy though . You might want to ask the vet .|`|4plr765Yaa	You can actually wash him as often as you like using a hypo-allergenic shampoo, or any other mild shampoo. I am a groomer and some people only have they're dogs washed when they come to see me every 4-6 weeks, which I wouldn't recommend. I think you should bath your dog at least every 2 weeks. Good grooming habits are beneficial to your pets health.|`|1H0vYaJxaa	I would keep a nose on how they smell. Also if they have fecal mater attached to them. Try baby wipes first and if that does not help get the good shampoo (not from walmart or the dollar store go to the pet store) and watch the link below if you have any questions. Oh and don't for get to have all the supplies necessary before you start (towel, blowdryer, nail clippers) good luck!|`|KmC0K59taa	If he smells and needs a bath, go for it.  They make puppy shampoo.  I just gave a 6 wk old Golden a bath and she was fine.|`|kFWZKnq0aa	you should use baby shampoo, and make sure the water is not cold but not hot either just slightly warm. do it in the sink not the tub or outside, and make sure he gets completely dry before going outside. Im not a groomer but when i first got my long haired chihuahua at 8 weeks she had fleas so we had to bathe her. and she was fine, i barely used any shampoo cause of how small she is. so use your judge ment. (hint: if your dogs paws or tummy turn pinkish, its to hott) hope this helps :)

Grass can be picked or you can have the pig outside eating it as long as it's properly protected from danger (like running away, cats and birds).  You can also buy living pet grass or grow it yourself (wheat grass).  They love dandelions, especially the leaves.  White clover is also something they enjoy.  Some plants produce toxic leaves but good fruit or veg, so do some research.  Some plants can be eaten at different stages, like when the leaves are small and tender.  I think the entire pea plant is edible, whereas the tomato plant is not.  Many flowers are edible, like roses, pansies and violets.<br>  Keep researching and you'll find out more does and don'ts.

The Timothy that everyone on this group loves is just one of many types of high quality grass hay.  Any good clean grass hay other than fescue is as good for cavies as timothy (some are actually higher in nutrients).  We buy Coastal Bermuda hay and feed fresh common Bermuda grass from out yard.

I would use a leash, and use your commands and praise him when he does good.  The bladder isn't grown until 6-months-old, and they are not fully potty trained until 1-year-old.  He is probably feeling like he is being abandoned again by going back and forth between homes.  Here are some tips, use what helps.  I use a crate* to potty train with, but only for potty training and then I break it down and store it.  I put blankets and a small food and water dish in the crate.  Dogs don't potty where they eat and sleep.  When they are first little, I only expect them to hold their potty for 4 hours, and then 6 hours, then 8 hours and so on.  So when they are first little, I set a timer or alarm clock to wake myself up at night to take them *out.  I only allow my puppy in the bedroom* or the living room, only one room at a time.  They have to graduate to more space.  If I allow them to have full run of the house, it will overwhelm them.  I take them out the same door each time.  I tie a dinner bell to the door handle.  Do not use a jingle bell as they could get their toe caught in it.  So when they are little, I ring the bell for them, and then open the door to go *outside to potty.  When they get bigger, I take their paw and whack the bell and open the door to go potty.  Eventually getting to the place where the puppy will ring the bell and let me know when they need to go potty.  Dogs want to please you, so it is your job to let them know what behaviors please you and what doesn't.  So when my puppy goes potty, I give her a treat*, and clap, and make a fuss and praise her.  So she learns that going potty outside makes me happy.  If she has an accident, make a disgust sound like “tsst” and take her out right away.  I never yell* or spank* my puppies.  Take them out when they first wake up, after they eat or drink, before nap, finish romping, when their activities change, or when they are sniffing around. Some puppies go pee right away, but may not go poop until 10 minutes later, so wait for the poop.  I have a little play time here, because sometimes I think they are done, and they are not.  Puppies train at their own pace.  While I may have a puppy that hasn't had an accident in several weeks, I don't let my guard down.  I don't expect my puppies to be "fully potty trained" until one-year-old.  If they have a setback, shake it off, and start over.  I only have my puppies in the crate when I am not watching them.  When I am sleeping, cooking, ironing, doing chores, basically when I am not watching her.  All other times, she is out of the crate practicing being a "big girl."  This is the time I train her how to behave in the house.  So we are practicing "no barking", 'no biting", "no jumping", and "don't eat the furniture."  I also have to practice "playing inside" so she doesn't knock over things.  You must keep the puppy in sight when they are little because they don’t know the difference between newspaper and carpet, and you don’t want them sneaking off and getting into trouble.   Some puppies can sleep through the night around 3-months-old, but their bladder is grown around 6-months-old. <br>    <br>  REVISIONS:  <br>  *I use a CRATE to train with.  It is the method I prefer, compared to other methods I have tried.  I noticed that if they are in the crate, while I am doing chores, they are o.k., because the crate allows them to see me and be re-assured.  The crate can also be a comfort when stored in the basement for dogs who live in areas where thunderstorms and tornados are an issue. .  However, use the method that works best for you.....a laundry basket, a cardboard box, a woof-woof house, x-pen, child gates, whatever works for you. <br>  *OUTSIDE, pee pad, litter box, whichever method you are using.   When the puppy is first little, keep the pee pad, litter box near the food and water dish, so the puppy can eat and drink, and then go potty.  You can move it away as they get older.  The pee pad has a scent that smells and initiates potty.  Sometimes a pee pad makes a sound that scares some puppies, so you might want to use a litter box if that happens.  The pee pad allows a puppy to walk around, but a litter box keeps the puppy in one place. <br>  *BEDROOMS, I use the bedroom and living room for training, because it works for me.  Choose rooms that work for you, but watch for rooms that are damp, or drafty.  While my puppies sleep in the bedroom during training, once they are trained, I let them sleep where they want to.  They don't have to sleep in the bedroom forever. <br>  *TREATS.  While I use treats for training, you don't have to.  I like Charlee Bears for training (a little cracker for a little mouth,) I use them for training, but once they are trained, I cut back on them.  <br>  *SOME PUPPIES will go potty in the same spot each time.  Some puppies have to be told to go potty.  A command like "go out" for pee, or "go finish" for poop, might work for you, keep saying “go finish” until the puppy poops.  This is a good thing to train if you travel with your dogs.  By using commands, the puppy won't get confused when you are visiting someone, on vacation with you, or when you get to a new home.  The command will tell them what you want them to do in an unfamiliar place.  You might also want to use a leash method, so the puppy doesn’t sneak off, or for strange places. <br>  *YELLING.  It is not a good idea to "yell" or "spank" your puppy and then take them outside when they have an accident.  They may get confused and think that going outside is punishment.  While you want to correct them, if you are extreme, they may not want to go outside again.  Shake it off, and resume your schedule.  You have to keep it real.  Puppies train at their own pace, but a puppy can only hold their potty for a few hours.  A guide would be 1 hour for each month of age, plus 1 hour, so a three-month-old puppy should only be expected to hold their potty for 4 hours at most.     <br>  SOURCE:  These tips, tricks, and ideas were contributed from many brilliant minds.

The training will take a few months though.I'm not an expert and this might not work for you but it did for us. When puppies are first starting out they don'tt understand that outside is where they need to go. Kennel training has been VERY efficient for me. I have now trained 3 dogs in the past year using this method. We let the dog out every hour, rewarding with a treat when the puppy went to the bathroom. Whenever an accidentoccurredd in the house we immediately let them out and then put them in their kennel without a blanket-since the kennel was also used when we left the house the blanket was in when we left. (Also, do not let them out of the kennel while they are yipping because that tells the dog that they can get out by doing this). Make sure that non-ammonia cleaner is used when cleaning up the accidents. Any more questions email.

A95qI5TGaa	Well, in response to your added detail, I have a list:<br>  <br>  1. You are not a snake, and the relation between a habitat and an aquarium for you would be moving from your home town to being locked into a 10x10 room with roomservice - still sound appealing, only seeing those four walls?  <br>  <br>  2.  I'm so VERY glad to hear, even though I wish you wouldn't keep it, that you are taking the measures to care for it by taking it to a vet.  Parasites are common in wild snakes, and with the stress of captivity, can easily overcome and kill the little guy.  <br>  <br>  3.  rat snakes are not aggressive, really, by nature - however, if you can handle him already without being bit, it is either sick, pregnant, or very full.  <br>  <br>  4.  you are correct that a rat snake requires like care to that of a corn snake.  However, if he's that big, get him a  MINIMUM of a 30 gallon tank, with two hide boxes, a climbing branch, water bowl, etc...  They've been reported up to 8 1/2 ft. long, so...<br>  <br>  6.  As for how often to feed it, first take it to the vet.  They will likely to an obligatory worming (since it's wild) and possibly a blood test/fecal test for other parasites.  This wormer is given with or without food, but they like to see the snake eat within a week afterwards.  Since you got him, give it a week and see if he poops anytime during this.  After he poops, it tells you his system is a)functioning well and b) emptier.   After a week, try offer him food whether he pooped or not, and judge his interest to it.  Depending on his size, large fuzzies or small adult rats would work to feed.  Try frozen, but more than likely you will end up feeding live (him not wanting anything else).  With the larger rats, fresh kill the rodents to prevent injury.  <br>  <br>  Again, I think taking snakes out of the wild is crude - and often ILLEGAL - when a captive bred snake has better appetite, demeanor, less parasites, and are less stressed living in a cage.  But, if you don't return it to the wild, make sure to take good care of him.  Good luck...|`|unRxUIphaa	It should be fed once a week unless it is under weight then u can feed it twice a week until it is up to weight...

cqVIQBjXaa	tadpoles generally spend a lot of their time laying around on the bottom, they are eating algea, so they don't really have to move around a lot. how long have you had these tadpoles? are they in a cycled tank? either way, if you don't have a filter in the tank, you need to do daily water changes to keep down the levels of ammonia and give them fresh oxygen. even if you do have a filter, you should be doing weekly water changes. amphibians are very sensative to water pollutants so don't skimp on the water changes!<br>  <br>  if your tank doesn't have a lot of visable algae in it, you should go out and buy algae pellets for them to eat or get some live algae from wherever you got the tadpoles.<br>  <br>  you do eventually have to give them a place to exit the water, but not yet, usually, their lungs are not formed until their front legs have begun growing. don't manually remove them from the water at any time, they have to be at just the right stage to start breathing air, and when you remove them you are suffocating them!<br>  <br>  this is just the broad spectrum of things, but if you e-mail me with more info, i can help you out more!|`|nVLSmZeNaa	As you probably know, they are metamorphasizing into frogs.  You might want to put a rock in there to allow them to crawl onto something when they have developed enough to breathe air.

Not much help I know...sorry|`|AA10636305	Hope this helps:<br>  <br>  Tadpoles are really just eating machines -- make sure that your provide them with enough food -- canned spinach works well but be sure to rinse it very very well to get the salt out...<br>  <br>  They're not going to do much but hang-out on the bottom... that's what they do in a pond<br>  <br>  You will see them get back legs and eventually front legs.  Once they have front legs they need something, like the  rock that others have mentioned,  they have now changed from having gills (and breathing like fish) to having lungs (and breathing like us).  <br>  <br>  At this same time you'll notice that they have a "frog" mouth at about the same time -- you will need to begin feeding them insects at this point.  They will only eat things that are moving... There are 2 ways to solve this (1) buy live food (2) find something like freeze-dried tubifex worms, wet it and hold it with round-tipped tweezers in front of your froglet and wiggle it a little until they eat it. <br>  <br>  Be careful with what you pick for food -- crickets are a great choice if there's lots of dry land in the habitat -- otherwise they'll drown -- if you feed mealworms you might want to consider crushing the very tip of the head with a pair of tweezers -- they have chewing mouth parts and can bite onto the frog/damage the digestive tract|`|s9OOyEjXaa	i once had tadpoles  and they did the same thing . what i say is that they might be resting or they are just scared and are not ready to swin in their new home

It happens every month. The best you can do is keep her inside when in heat and away from males! The RSPCA or ASPCA does desexing for $15-$50 dollars im sure thats not to expencive! Please get her desexed it pains me to see cats as young as four months getting pregnant every two months!|`|cxc8KEmVaa	I think the cat will stay in heat til it finds a mate.|`|fFuvcXN2aa	up to 4 months...my cat got pregnant had the litter and then got pregnant right away again|`|sNHHFKkvaa	I had a cat who had regular times of staying  in heat. She would last..close to a week if not more. To avoid the crying and so forth  we bought her a pillow and placed an electric heating blanket type of thing. It helped her a lot. Other than that she just braved it out!|`|a1ab90edc46546ca80e3ccdd1bccd6a5aa	don't let her outside unless you want kittens, and heat usually only lasts a couple three weeks. You can also check with your local humane society there are vets who will cooperate with low income to assist with spaying. (If you would qualify for that, you may not be low income, but sometimes the guidlines are higher then you think)|`|mpIiTBVIaa	go to petco or contact the humane society for inexpensiving fixing. please dont let her get pregnant.

You also have to go through an inspection and have all of your ducks in a row when it comes to sanitation, book keeping, and treatment of the animals.  I'd call them and ask about your particular situation to be sure before you pay the $10 to submit your application.|`|geChGvTGaa	just go to their website, its $18 and you can do it over the web.  Bassett person, I think you have the wrong registry!

2yttBrhXaa	A me questo soggetto mi ha sempre affascinato. <br>  <br>  Ai cani  ho spesso fatto il solletico sulla pancia, dietro le orecchie, sotto i piedi o dietro le ascelle quando si mettevano a pancia all' aria per vedere se ridevano. Ho trovato che quando li solletico se ne stanno li sul dorso beati e contenti con la bocca spalancata e la lingua fuori, il problema e' che e' difficile capire se stanno ridendo o no. <br>  <br>  Cmq penso di si. Se per esempio li sfiori nelle orecchie o in altre parti sensibili del corpo con una piuma mentre non se ne accorgono fanno dei grandi sbalzi il che mi fa pensare che lo sentono. <br>  <br>  PS: Quando faccio lo stesso ai gatti reagiscono come i cani quindi penso che lo stesso per molti animali . Il problema pero' rimane che e' difficile sapere se un gatto ride. Specialmente perche' i gatti ridono sotto i baffi e il loro sorriso e' sempre celato dai baffi.|`|83E8caKoaa	E' un po' come per gli umani: c'è chi lo soffre di più, chi meno e chi per nulla.<br>  Diverso dal solletico, poi, è il fatto se gradiscano o meno "grattatine" e stimoli in varie parti del corpo.<br>  Anche qui varia da individuo a individuo (un po' come per le "zone erogene" umanoidi) e solo tu puoi scoprire dove e come il tuo peloso preferisca essere grattato|`|Brqu10Zfaa	Buon giorno, dubito!<br>  <br>  bacio, bambolina|`|HtLWCbFFaa	boh...me lo sono chiesto anche io....forse si...quando gratto la pancia al mio cane lui move la zampa....forse e solletico...o forse solo un'attacco di prurito boh|`|38ow1bVWaa	..eheheheh!....ehehehehehehe!....ehehh!....<br>  Sisi!<br>  Cià!|`|RCw6zQGXaa	non penso perchè hanno il pelo|`|Vuita6Nlaa	nn credo hanno il pelo..gli piacciono di più i "grattini"..|`|b21glKWzaa	Dipende...!<br>  Hanno il pelo,e per questo si potrebbe dubitare,ma...forse se glielo fai un pò più a fondo,un minimo di solletico potrebbero sentirlo ;D!<br>  Buona fortuna ;***!|`|if5tDw9Vaa	si, il mio gatto almeno lo soffre da matti, si contorce tutto, balza in piedi e scappa ;p<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://it.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmNoSouIsDnzyU1P34oNCLHwDQx.;_ylv=3?qid=20071028021204AAVE9BG">http://it.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|pDIu5kvJaa	certo che lo soffrono!! lo soffrono in modo diverso da noi e naturalmente dipende dalla loro pelliccia, ma ti assicuro che se al mio cavallo faccio il solletico nel pancino potrebbe arrivarmi un bel calcione = )|`|umKZXhNkaa	alcuni...i cani x esempio lo soffrono sotto le zampe!nn ci credete?testatelo!sotto la zampa del cane ci sn le ormette...ci sn delle "fessure" di pelo...fategli il solletico li e vedrede cm si contorce!!!!!!!!|`|lzoyN8ESaa	i cani si|`|GDJJtMP8aa	Il mio gatto non patisce gli sculaccioni figurati se sente il solletico.... c'ha il cuoio al posto della pelle quella vecchia canaglia!<br>  ps. io amo il mio gatto =) <br>  <br>  Ciau Cunigliu ;-)

ZyYY6Bttaa	Unweaned means that a baby bird is not weaned from it's mother.unweaned means it can not take care of itself and feed itself.or even fend for itself.an unweaned bird is a bird which cannot live without it's mother feeding it.and yes it dose happen to baby budgies it can happen to any bird wild or demesticated.all birds that are babies and cannot feed itself with help of a mother or foster parent.just like a humane baby.babies can't eat solid food until they have teeth.babies that are unweaned still feed from a bottles are unweaned babies.weaned babies eat solid food without help or force feeding.if you have unweaned baby budgies here are some ways to feed them<br>  <br>  #1.go to a petstore and buy  exact baby bird food.it comes in powdered form.<br>  #2.heat up some water to normal tempature NOT HOT around 98F.take the water and put a few drops on your wrist like for a baby child.<br>  #3.read the directions and put that amount in the water<br>  #4.mix it until there is no clumps of powder in the water.<br>  #5.bend a spoon to act as a funnel.<br>  #6.slightly grab the head NOT tight!<br>  #7.take the spoon and put it to the babies beak and let the baby swallow.<br>  #8.it depens how old the baby is.1-7 days feed around the clock every 2 hours,8-21days every 6 hours.baby budgies are weaned around 21-30 days.put some soaked seed in a cup and each day streatch the feedings and sooner or later you will see cracked seeds on the floor of the cage.I know this was more then what you wanted but i hope this helps|`|wDA6iefDaa	Unweaned means the parents or the breeder still feeds the baby.  When a bird can eat seed or pellets on his own all the time it is considered weaned.|`|eNPYv9uFaa	An unweaned bird is a baby bird that has stopped hand feeding yet ..
