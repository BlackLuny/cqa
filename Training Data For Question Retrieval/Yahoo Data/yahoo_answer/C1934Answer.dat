LzSj90pbaa	Some people are fine with the texting, others are not. There is no way to tell you if its bad, youll have to try it for yourself.  I think it is bad, but i also think all touchscreens are terrible for texting. Touchscreen texting isnt all created equal though. There are two main types in cell phones. Resistive and capacitive. Resistive requires pressure and is what the storm has. It is no where near as sensitive as capacitive.   The phone is very slow and the updates have not fixed this. It is also still glitchey and will crash.  I do not think verizon is even close to the best. They lock many features down on phones and really dont have any phones that make you think 'wow' (in my case that is).  You would be surprised on how well you put this question together. Most people dont even give anything more then a title and nix details altogether.  Out of the phones listed, I would chose the bold. It has a great amount of features, a am oled screen, and is one of the most powerful phones out there.

c12f89f74cdfb1db528f24d3788fc217aa	Dude! The more you reduce the mp3 bit-rate (the number ranges from 32/64-320 kbps) the more songs you can accommodate in one CD. There are lots of mp3 rippers in web using which you can accomplish this. Somewhere in the ripper's options, set the bit-rate value accordingly. At least have the value as 64 kbps for decent sound effect.

No other phone cant compete with internet, email, and other appiclations. No other phone can compete with its MP3 player ethier, since it essenitally is an ipod. However it's storage is rather small compared to other ipod, but much better than other mp3 phones. (8g or 16g). Phone wise it is sometimes limited, there is to multi-media SMS  texting so you have to send picture texts via email which can be annoying. The keyboard is easy to get use to, the screen is really good and the camera is really good too.

Iphone is sure a cult object and i have to. Everybody loves it. Its really cool watching movies and also listening to music. One main problem is, that the battery dies fast. ;)  You Jailbreak the iPhone to install third party application a.k.a all applications, that dont come from apple (i actually think this is the only reason you should buy an iPhone and it is so simple that anybody can do it).  Unlock is so you can use any sim and activat is so that you can use without using a real contract.
3CJAUyqPaa	Any miniDV tape based camcorder with:  1) Mic jack.  2) Manual audio control    Starting lowest:  Canon HV20/HV30/HV40 or Sony HDR-HC9 - All can do DV, DV widescreen, HDV. Small lenses and imaging chips make lowlight capture icky. These are essentially high-end consumer camcorders. Manual controls are accessed through the menu. On the HC9, the ring around the lens barrel doubles as manual focus or manual zoom - cannot do both at the same time. Mic jacks are 1/8" stereo so use of good XLR mics requires an XLR adapter like those from juicedLink or BeachTek.    Canon GL2, Sony DCR-VX2100 - Both are standard definition and do DV and DV widescreen. Larger lenses and imaging chips provide better low light behavior. Lots of granular manual control on the outside of the camcorder. Mic jacks are 1/8" stereo so use of good XLR mics requires an XLR adapter like those from juicedLink or BeachTek. GL2 is a workhorse like the Panny AG-DVX100.    Panasonic AG-DVX100 (a/b) - You know this cam. Workhorse. XLR audio in. Lots of granular manual control on the outside of the camcorder. Standard definition DV and DV widescreen only.    As a film student, you know that handlheld will not provide the steady shots you want - ALWAYS use a tripod or other steadying device. SpiderBraces are fun shoulder mounts.    You will also want a LANC (I *think* all of the above have a LANC port).|`|f068a705d34345ed034504f05d27c713aa	at this point of your career the camera is just a tool.  don't buy anything yet.  keep using what you have.  once you've taken a few classes you'll have a better idea of what you're going to need.  spend what you can afford but don't cheap out.  the majority of video shot is on some type of tripod..., even hand held shots use a steady cam of some sort.  don't discount full size cameras.  the uneducated masses will think that you are better just because you have a larger camera.  it will get you more respect when you bid on jobs.|`|BsV2TQAvaa	Although I can't say anything about specific models I just want to point out that big clunkiness is a really good thing if you EVER shoot without a tripod. The weight of a pro camera has inertia and you end up witha more stable picture than you'll ever get from a small camcorder.
6532e7bb93f79f7b7bbc9eb89e6704baaa	All bluetooth headsets are a little different, but on a lot of them, you have to put them into pairing mode. usually, you hold the button until the light stays lit solid(not flashing) then under accesory settings on your ps3, go to register bluetooth device, then register headset. have it scan for the headset, put in the code (usually 0000) and you're all set|`|hWqVIgPsaa	from the x menu bar go all the way to the left and scroll down and look for accesory settings its there somewhere
bf04eda87a4053f72857e70e26cc077faa	you ue the 55-200 when you want to zoom in further than the 18-55 would let you.  You use the 18-55 when you want more wide angle than you can get with the 55-200.      The 18-200 is an all in one lens so you carry one lense instead of two.  However, they are usually slower (higher f stop) than smaller zooms and usually not as sharp.|`|AA10903893	You use the 18-55 when you may want a wider field of view.    Obviously you use the 55-200 when you may want to zoom in on something further away.    The advatage of the 18-200 DX lens is that you can change lenses less often, and is lighter than standard lenses because they take advantage of the 1.6x EFL change of the smaller sensor.  However, be aware that DX lenses are specifically for the APS-C sized sensor.  If someday you go to a full frame sensor camera (i.e. D3, D300 or upcoming D700) you will not be able to use your DX lens and would have to buy a new one.      The D80 like all Nikon products is a solid mid-level camera.  The only real drawback to the camera is that it is noisy at higher ISO settings (something Nikon suffered with until the recent release of cameras with the new Expeed processor)
AA10903893	Other than making sure no water dried and left drop marks on the lens, unfortunately there is probably very little that can be done.    Unless you camera is of the type that is weather sealed (which I will assume this one wasn't), water damage will probably not be covered under warranty, and in most cases (though not all), the cost of repairing a point-n-shoot camera usually outstrips the cost of a new camera, though you can check with the manufacturer to see if you can have it evaluated and see what a repair would cost (if they will do that without additional charge up front).|`|i5OVORXgaa	Let it dry out and see if that helps... and be more careful in the future, okay?!|`|E478z7XGaa	Hi Andrea.  Sorry to hear about your camera..  The short answer to your question is... No, there is nothing YOU can do.  It is questionable if the camera is repairable at all...  but if it is,  the only one qualified to fix it would be a camera repair tech.   You don't even know how many cameras we get in the shop that have been ruined by being exposed to water.   Most of them, wind up in the big plastic tub of "can't be repaired" cameras.   Your best bet is to take it in to a camera repair for an estimate.    The repair tech will be honest in telling you if you should just spend your money on a new camera.   If you want to take your camera out in conditions that are wet..  or out to the pool or beach...  I would suggest that you buy the cheapest camera you can find... as it definately won't be lasting very long.
AA10903893	The battery is rated to take approximately 200 pictures before requiring a recharge.  Things like using the flash more often, and leaving the camera on while not taking pictures, or continuously using the auto-focus without actually shooting a picture will reduce the number of shots you get before you have to recharge the battery.    Yes you can buy a spare battery.  Prices are approximately $20 or less depending on where you shop.
6489dd6288438d0ac1d6bd81b79f0d8daa	I don't get it...the E410 is a dSLR, so there should be no shutter lag at all.    I agree about the Live View. If you are using the LCD screen to compose you images, then that's probably why it's sooo slow. It's a dSLR...so use the viewfinder instead, and there should be no lag.    If you are trying to shoot moving people/objects you should try using the Sport Mode setting instead...until you learn about shutter speeds etc.    Please persist with the User Manual...read it and follow it page by page to learn how best to use your camera. Just don't bother with Live View at this stage.    The links below might be very helpful to you...I suggest you take the time to read and therefore learn as much about general (and SLR) photography. They will help you to understand about exposure, shutter speeds, f stops (apertures), ISO etc. etc. By doing this, I'm sure you will come to enjoy using your camera a whole lot more...|`|AA10903893	Either "pre-focus" your camera (press shutter button half way down) on a subject of similar distance then (while still holding it) wait for your picture opportunity.  Alternatively you could switch to manual focus so the camera doesn't waste time focusing before taking the picture.|`|4NxXKJBjaa	Turn off the Live View function and compose your pictures through the finder.  Its likely that the time to turn off live view and lower the mirror when you press the shutter is the delay you mean.
u653DtGGaa	thats normal for the older xbox 360s|`|Ao9xL1pvaa	The fan and/or vents are clogged with dust.  This can cause your 360 to overheat (2 red lights in the ring of lights around the power button will come on and your 360 will turn off).  The best way to clean them is to spray compressed air into the vents/fan from below (hold it up and spray into it from below so that gravity will carry the dust out of the 360 and not push it back up into the 360).

ef9e5fcbe388f3790b6831ba142375b9aa	Well midi itself isn't actually a sound file like a .wav.  Wave files store the actually audio information while midi on the other hand midi stores the velocity, pitch and length of the notes and is player through a synth or sample player.  So midi is basically telling the players what notes to play, how hard to play em and for how long.  The problem with converting this to a wav is that you need to play it through a sample player to record it, and the quality of sound depends entirely on the synth/sample player you're using.    I may be wrong but you may need some decent audio recording software to sample and record it to a wav file for you.

Alltel looked good to me. The only way is to break the contract and pay the fine for it.|`|453e5d45c887ce2de9320a9b06ac8835aa	You can get out of the contract, but you'll have to pay a heavy early disconnection fee of somewhere in the ballpark of $150. There is one loophole though that could get you out of the contract without having to pay. If you can find someone with a Photo I.D, and good credit, they can go with you down to the cellphone provider and they can just switch the contract over to that person. So that person gets a free phone, and a no hassle contract, and you get to get out of YOUR contract scott free.

It comes with the high-end XBox360 but you will have to buy the ethernet cable if you only have the XBox360 "core" system.    The PC/Laptop must have Windows XP with a media sharing software installed (which includes Windows Media Player 11) or be a Windows Media Center PC/Laptop.    The PC/Laptop must, of course, have the hardware to connect to any network.  The Presario V2000 should already have a built-in integrated 10/100Base-T Ethernet LAN (RJ-45 connector).    Just connect the Xbox360 to the Laptop using the ethernet cable, one end goes to the XBox360 and the other end to the PC/Laptop.

I think you mean optical input.      Anyway, hooking up the PS3 to the TV is easy.  Just use the HDMI cable.  To get the surround sound on the receiver, use an optical cable from the PS3 to the receiver.  Be sure to change the settings to optical and HDMI in the cross menu bar.    I think you mean TV to receiver because it's kind of pointless to use your TV speakers for sound output.|`|AA10347450	HDMi is for video............only!!! just use the analog cables (red and white) to hook up to surround.

You might be able to find it on ebay but I think the software itself runs around 30 or 40 dollars. The only other way would be getting a friend to use their phone that has a memory card in it and transfer a few songs to you. The razr v3c has limited storage. The v3m (new razrs) have expandable memory. (just a hint...if you file an insurance claim sometimes they will provide you will a new model.

aeKCc53aaa	I agree to Dan, if you really don't want it, Nintendo DS is much cheaper than Sony PSP so you can sell it and use that money for a DS and a bunch of games (or save the rest... whatever you want).  I would also suggest you to try all the features of the PSP before you sell it, you might miss listening to your music or watch movies in your handheld as DS lacks of these features from the box. If you still want to exchange or sell it, go ahead.  Personally I have a DS and Brain Age (along with other games), in here (Mexico) is one of the cheapest games you can find and it's enjoyable.|`|q0ZSzkYpaa	the psp has a bunch of features. if u are looking intro buying a ps3 dont sell your psp. it can be used as a controller for ps3  and can control your ps3 from a wifi hot spot if you listen to your whole collection of music on your psp delete4 them and download new ones right from youyr ps3 same thing with movies|`|2baff63bc38becb1988d7f76c5c3efc0aa	NO, you shouldn't give up your psp you can do so much more with the psp than the ds lite.|`|98dd9c89857f5b0f936290a198749040aa	If you don't like the PSP games then I would sell it and but the DS Lite.

Pl0tZ68oaa	CONTROL REMOTO  Un mando a distancia o control remoto es un circuito electrnico usado para realizar una operacin remota sobre una mquina.    El trmino se emplea generalmente para referirse al mando a distancia (llamado por lo general simplemente "el mando") para la televisin u otro tipo de aparato electrnico, como DVD, HIFI, ordenadores, y para encender y apagar un interruptor. Los mandos a distancia para esos aparatos son normalmente peque?os objetos (fcilmente manipulables con una mano) con una matriz de botones para ajustar los distintos valores, como por ejemplo, el canal de televisin, el nmero de cancin y el volumen. De hecho, en la mayora de dispositivos modernos, el mando contiene todas las funciones de control, mientras que el propio aparato controlado slo dispone de los controles ms primarios. La mayora de estos controles remotos se comunican con sus respectivos aparatos va se?ales de infrarrojo (IR) y slo unos pocos utilizan se?ales de radio. Su fuente de energa suele ser peque?as pilas de tipo AA o AAA.        Uno de los primeros ejemplos de mando a distancia fue desarrollado en 1893 por Nikola Tesla y descrito en su patente nmero 613809, titulada Mtodo de un aparato para el mecanismo de control de vehculo o vehculos en movimiento.    En 1903, Leonardo Torres Quevedo present el telekino en la Academia de Ciencias de Pars, acompa?ado de una memoria y haciendo una demostracin experimental. En ese mismo a?o obtuvo la patente en Francia, Espa?a, Gran Breta?a y Estados Unidos. El telekino consista en un autmata que ejecutaba rdenes transmitidas mediante ondas hertzianas; constituy el primer aparato de radiodireccin del mundo, y fue un pionero en el campo del mando a distancia. En 1906, en presencia del Rey y ante una gran multitud, demostr con xito el invento en el puerto de Bilbao al guiar un bote desde la orilla; ms tarde intentara aplicar el telekino a proyectiles y torpedos, pero tuvo que abandonar el proyecto por falta de financiacin.    El primer modelo de avin por control remoto vol en 1932. Durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial, se llev a cabo el uso de tecnologa de control remoto para propsitos militares; uno de los resultados de esto fue el misil alemn Wasserfall. El primer artilugio dise?ado para controlar remotamente una televisin fue desarrollado por Zenith Radio a principios de 1950s. El mando extraoficialmente llamado Lazy Bones (~para vagos) usaba un cable para conectarse al televisor. Para mejorar el engorroso sistema, se cre un control remoto sin cables en 1955. El mando, llamado Flashmatic, funcionaba enviando un rayo de luz a una clula fotoelctrica. Desafortunadamente, las clulas no distinguan entre la luz del mando y la luz de otras fuentes. El Flashomatic tambin requera que se apuntara el mando a distancia al receptor con precisin.    En 1956, Robert Adler desarrollo el Zenith Space Command (Mando del espacio cenit), un control sin cables. Era mecnico y usaba ultrasonidos para cambiar el canal y el volumen. Cuando el usuario pulsaba un botn del mano a distancia, haca un chasquido y golpeaba una barra, de ah el trmino clicker (chasqueador). Cada barra emita una frecuencia diferente y los circuitos en la televisin detectaban el ruido. La invencin del transistor hizo posible mandos electrnicos ms baratos, que contena un cristal piezoelctrico que era alimentado por una corriente elctrica oscilatoria a una frecuencia cercana o mayor a la del umbral superior de audicin humana, aunque todava audible para perros. El receptor contena un micrfono unido a un circuito que estaba configurado a la misma frecuencia. Algunos problemas de este mtodo eran que el receptor poda ser activado accidentalmente por ruidos que ocurrieran de forma natural y, algunas personas, especialmente mujeres jvenes, podan or las agudas se?ales ultrasnicas. Hubo incluso un incidente memorable, en el cual un xilfono cambiaba los canales de ese tipo de televisores, ya que algunos de los armnicos del instrumento eran iguales a la frecuencia ultrasnica del mando a distancia.    El impulso para un tipo ms complejo de mando a distancia vino a finales de los 70 con el desarrollo del servicio de teletexto Ceefax por la BBC. La mayora de mandos que existan por entonces tenan un nmero limitado de funciones, a veces slo cuatro: cadena siguiente, cadena anterior, subir o bajar el volumen.       Mando a distancia de un televisor Philips de 1978Este tipo de mando no satisfaca las necesidades de televisores con teletexto donde las pginas se identificaban con un nmero de tres dgitos. Un mando a distancia para seleccionar pginas de teletexto necesitara botones para cada nmero del cero al nueve, as como otras funciones, como por ejemplo, cambiar del texto a la imagen (y viceversa) y los controles normales de un televisor: volumen, canal, brillo, intensidad del color, etc. Los primeros televisores con teletexto usaban mandos con cable para elegir las pginas, pero su uso continuado, requerido para el teletexto, indic rpidamente la necesidad de un dispositivo sin cables. As que ingenieros de la BBC comenzaron conversaciones con uno o dos manufacturadores de televisiones, lo cual llev a los primeros prototipos sobre 1977-78, ya pudiendo controlar un mayor nmero de funciones. ITT fue una de las compa?as, la cual ms tarde dara su nombre al Protocolo ITT de comunicaciones infrarrojas.    A principios de los a?os 80, cuando se desarrollaron los semiconductores para emitir y recibir radiacin infrarroja, los mandos a distancia fueron gradualmente cambiando a esta tecnologa que, en 2006, todava es ampliamente usada. Tambin existen tecnologas de radio, como los Sistemas de audio Bose y aquellas basadas en Bluetooth.

So if you have the Guitar Hero Wii drums, you can only use them on the Wii, you can't even use them on the XBox 360 or PS3 (you would need to buy the specific Guitar Hero instruments for the XBox 360 or PS3).    There is no PC version of the Guitar Hero games so they won't work on a computer.

BMConIedaa	Every tree needs the 8 surrounding spaces to be free from obstruction.  If you can't walk around it, it won't grow.    Odds are, you are planting trees to close to each other, or too close to rocks, signs, or the shore.    The easiest way to ensure that a tree will grow is to chop down an existing tree, and plant in the space the old tree grew in.    Imagine your town is a 5x5 grid.  Coconuts only grow in the southernmost fifth of your town.  Cedar trees only grow in the northern 2/5ths.    The season has no bearing on if a tree successfully takes root.  Watering has no effect on tree sprouts.  I have planted dozens of successful trees, and I never watered any of them.    If you need more info, read up at GameFaqs:  http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/wii/game...    or ACC:  http://www.animalcrossingcommunity.com|`|CcJdEaRpaa	put the trees farther apart|`|siAPVQwDaa	I have had the same problem, I plant a tree and after a few days it is just gone. I don't think you can plant any fruit in your town unless it is the fruit growing on the trees. Sell it to Tom for bells. I have the book to this game if you have any more questions, just let me know.|`|6HAO2cw4aa	Seasons don't effect when trees grow. I think they aren't growing because there may already be too many trees in that area. Try spreading the trees far apart and then water them. Also, for the coconut trees, they need to be planted as close to the sand as possible but NOT in the sand. Doesn't matter if there's dirt or snow, they grow in the ground right above the sand.|`|vs3vz6lIaa	well if you plant one then you have to water it for 3 days every day more than twice a day so good luck|`|TB7AyiLiaa	that happened to me too  but i learned you have to chop down a tree and plant the seed in place of the cut down tree  in order for it to grow  sorta  sucks i know  but sometimes you dnt have to do that

The only people who claim this are trying to make money out of false civil court cases or to be controversial.      the radiation used is so low power it cant do any damage and will only go into the top layers of your skin if it did.  (sitting on a mast might have some damage on it but at 30ft the risk is negligible too).    the only real risk form mobile is lack of concentration while using them or driving using them - which can lead to concentration reduced alertness induced accidents.|`|r6OQkyIGaa	They say they aren't.

AA12180617	As for Image quality the LENS matters more than the MPix, for example if the camera  is 5Mpix but it has a pinhole lens (like 95% of phones)  its NOT the number of MPix that determines image quality its the optics and lens..    The bigger the lens the better the image going to the sensor... a good lens (such as samsung Pixon) with a 3Mpix sensor will always have a better picture than a 5mpix with a pinhole lens,  when you compare images on screen you are comparing screens not images...    to really see this print image on a A4 page then see difference.    if the cameras have pinhole lenses then there is NO advantage going from 2mPix to 10Mpix you get same poor quality image just with more pixels and larger file size, thats why many camera default to 640*480 images (0.3Mpix) as the they don't show the problems of the lens..

HekFanRvaa	get a very small desk fan ( i have  a 4" one) and place it beside the PS3 not blowing towards the PS3 (coz it will blow dust in to your PS3) but blowing away to suck away hot air and blow the dust away too.

So the answer is no, there is no way to do it.    -Wiiplay_ds|`|FIL4vngsaa	The only way would be through the PlayStationStore.  Just wait for the real game, or wait for it to come to your PSStore.    I live in the UK and got the Demo from the PSStore! Ha! lol|`|00Dy5ktsaa	It's out now to everyone isn't it?    I'm in Australia and it's on our Playstation Store for free.    almost 1.3GB worth of sweet demo.    And yeah... just make an account if the u.s is behind the rest of the world again.
ddd2b272975c49eb0b349a665e1d92eaaa	Those games you have have online gaming, that's is why you are asked to connect to internet or that the games will need to check if the game is legit or not.    Why don't you check out www.getjar.com, some java games are freeware.|`|NzSA6dmyaa	i dnt understand, these games download from the internet thats where they are on a server somewhere that is connected as to the interent  if u dont have a connection to the net u cant download them because u cant get to them|`|PP8tKxYdaa	no,there may be a few sample games on it
SKkE3fK1aa	IT WILL WORK as long as you use MEMORY STICK DUO or MEMORY STICK PRO DUO as long as they are less than 16GB (meaning 8GB will work).    These memory cards are different fron SanDisk's line-up of SD cards and MMC cards.|`|FQnPwJXQaa	some are compatable but some r not. if you check on the back of the cover of the card u can see if it is compatable
AqLIIyoVaa	did u try resetting...like holding the menu button and the center button at the same time..for like 30 sec. you'll see an apple sign, and its resetted!
FKzZTtw2aa	if you are in hong kong, go to a music store. otherwise i'll share my hong kong account with you. it doesnt have any money in it but there is a ton of free stuff that can be downloaded. click my avatar for my email.|`|1ykhOBLuaa	i doubt if tis available in honkkong
XtVXeHoyaa	Well it should recover. But I do Warn you as MINE DID NOT RECOVER   to have the best chances of recovery take the battery out like you have done and leave it out for about 48 hours. Some phones feature a battery check when you pull out the battery on the back or top next to the battery connector should be a strip if the strip has a pink line across it it could means the battery has significant water damage and may not work or hold a full charge. Another note it should still work as long as no current is passed though the phone I can tell you I know some one who fixes electronics and with a lot of plasma TVs they open them up to find the a clogged with dust so they hose them down with water and let them dry the only concern it the speakers but otherwise it should work was the phone on when it fell in the water? also leave the phone out for 36 hours or open it up and dry the parts your self hope this helps|`|gX0lCfiYaa	Use a hair dryer to air out the phone. Leave it untouched till a day or so. Your phone has like a 25% chance out of 100 that will survive but I would be looking up for a new phone as many phones don't survive water.     Sim card should be fine as I have done the same before except it was the washing machine and the phone died. -_-    You only lost all your contacts numbers because you had it saved to the phone not the sim card, to save it to sims, go to contact options and click save all to sim. May vary between different sim card company.    Good luck and I hope your phone lived. Be more careful next time ;)|`|h7M9cHxhaa	I have friends who dropped their phone into the toilet bowl, or fish ponds. They did ther same thing as you.    Sadly for you, the phone is already 'dead'. It nearly impossible for it to recover on it's own unless it's a miracle.    Your only(maybe there are other choices) choice is to repair it. Which might cost as much as your phone!    You're better off buying another phone.

BMConIedaa	How old is your spoiled br... I mean, young lad?  You don't mention that, which is really the crux of your question.  Is he old enough to know reality from fantasy?  Does he manage his own money well?  Do you bother to play any of his games with him?  Do you even know what kind of games he likes?    I don't know you, and I don't know your son, but based on the little info you've given, I'd say you're already letting him do whatever he wants, and that he'll probably do whatever he wants regardless of what you say.    Its worth noting that NOTHING IS LEGALLY "HIS."  As long as he is a minor and living in your house, you have every right to take away his belongings.  He has no property rights until he's an adult in the eyes of the law.|`|MERgQTRUaa	Yeah! First of all, it is his money. Secondly, the PS3 has the new Blu Ray Player and you can enjoy that too. The picture is incredible!! The PS3 is just like any other playstation but has a much better picture and has the advantage of playing all other Playstation games|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	I say yes, let him get the PS3.  Why not?  It's a Blu-ray/DVD/CD player.|`|xhqKLSwCaa	If he saved his money and bought these items and is selling them then let him learn how to manage it.  I would be concerned if he is selling items he asked for recently asked for and where bought for him and started selling them.  Talk to your son and find out his purpose for selling his items.|`|9roHz7ZTaa	It is his money, so whatever he wants.|`|qv2CtINuaa	He's 10 years old, if he was my son he would not have sold the Wii to start with. He needs to learn to be more responsible with his money. As for him wanting a ps3, how long is that going to last?    If I was you- don't buy him & don't let him buy any more electronics- pointless if he is going to sell them when he gets bored with them.|`|OpCYOra3aa	IF ITS HIS MONEY THAN WHY NOT|`|l9yejFMlaa	well you can't really tell him that he can't get it because he already sold his wii if you didn't want him to buy it you should have told him before he sold his wii|`|yZnumVknaa	Wow.  If he got a PS3 because you can install an alternate OS on it like vista.  I'd say no btw.|`|8G3T0JJVaa	let your kid do what ever he likes he's gonna end up selling the ps3 anyway just tell him to be careful to who he sells his stuff to.
38c6373fd3b19e3800899c623919c0e0aa	The Voyager, by far. I had a Razr V3 for two years and could not wait to get rid of it! Horrible battery life and only so-so signal. Plus, if you do any texting, the Voyager has a full qwerty keyboard too. BIG plus!|`|0cf4Qja5aa	Go Voyager!|`|X7qx3s0Qaa	Voyager! cooler!|`|QscGMFPwaa	OOMG, i had the razor once, and it was a great phone, and I just got teh voyager 3 days ago, so it's not like i have had it for a long time and can tell you, but I LOVE THIS PHONE.  I can go online with it, i can use IM, it's got a full key pad, but I LOVE the fact that you can text on your touch screen on the front too, it's so great, it's so easy.  I think this phone is SWEET. I know a few people that have the NV2 and they love that phone too, which is almost the same, except its not touch screenon the front.  Basically, i love this phone, you never get board with it...it's a lot of fun.  I haven't quite figured out teh camera yet, and you can also get visual voicemail but that cost an extra 2 or 3 dollars a month, but i'm not doing that, but the sales rep said that this phone is better for the internet than any of the other phones besides a blackberry...Good luck, and if you decide to go with it, i think you'll have  made a great decision...FYI, if you do get this phone, be sure to get a silicone case, and some screen protectors, becuase it wll freeze up on you all the time if you don't get a screen protector and it gets scratched...the silicone cover will protect it if you drop it...    As far as prone to damages, if you get the screen protector and the silicone case, you'll be good.  Just make sure to get insurance on it so that if something does go wrong you're covered.  AND i got a $50 dollar rebate on my voyager, so it's only going to cost me 80 bucks, i don't think that's bad considering all the things it does...    YAY, GET THE VOYAGER!
fRUA8QiAaa	yes almost all carriers have pay as you go, You can pick up the Verizon phones for pay as you go at Wal-Mart. Or stores like that that are around you, and then when you need more mintues you can go to the verizon store or to circle k and get more minutes for your phone|`|b2dffdde9d95855452a59a5a7564c914aa	Yes.  http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/splas...    You can buy the phone and then add minutes as you need them.
92502a5afa35da6418b2d432655bcb0eaa	An unlocked iPhone can mean many things.   1. You can use the iPhone with T-mobile instead of just AT&T.   2. You can put different types of software on it, that it would normally be unable to download.   3. You can put windows games on it.   Those are the pros of it    The cons:  1. You can not update your iPhone with new software that Apple might come out with.   2. You can no longer have the Apple 1 year warranty that they promise you.   3. If it is damaged by liquids, you have to go and buy a new one, but if it was not unlocked you would pay $100 for water damage repair.     What is a sim card?  A sim card is a tiny chip that is inserted into any phone that is sold through AT&T or T-mobile. Unlike Sprint and Verizon that use digital networks, AT&T, and T-mobile use sim cards, and that is how you are able to obtain signal to make phone calls, text, or go on the internet. When you have an unlocked phone (iphone, or any other brand) they can be used for either cell phone company.   For example:   The sidekick phone is sold by T-mobile. If you have one that is unlocked, you can now use it for AT&T.     The iPhone is sold by AT&T. If you have one that is unlocked your phone can now work with T-mobile.|`|Jwk7Ib2vaa	Not only can you use the iPhone with any GSM carrier (AT&T, Verizon, etc.) but some people offer services that while unlocking, they will also add things to your iPhone. Be careful who you go to to get it unlocked, you never know what they might be putting on there as well.   Try going to the At&T store personally and have them unlock it for you.  Hope this helps!|`|HmKRbaiIaa	The iPhone runs on AT&T only. Unlocked iPhone means, unlocking it to run on other cell phone networks. A sim card is something you put in your phone which has all the memory and service stuff.|`|8XS7xeiXaa	it means that you can use any cell phone providers sim card in that phone if it is unlocked.    a sim card is what enables you to make calls & it will hold your phone numbers, & such.
86MO7Xwgaa	Maybe there's something wrong with the slot your memory card goes into, there coulb be dust in it or something.
zIjoaj3Baa	A Sidekick can only be used with T-Mobile unfortunately.|`|cdBRWbTUaa	Nope the sidekick doesnt let you hack the network.  Its way lame
86MO7Xwgaa	PLug your phone into your computer, then copy and paste the game form your documents to the applications file on your phone, then it will ask you to install the game when you try to open it on your mobile, and this takes around 10 seconds each game, once its done, you can play the games.

So, when i went back to Europe, i purchased a sim card and a european phone from www.callineurope.com. Their rates are so cheap!  While i was in France, all my incoming calls were FREE and all my outgoing calls to Canada were only $ 0.39/ min! same for text messaging.

7SUwlwp6aa	After doing some searching on this one, most material refers to fast beeping when a battery is inserted/battery test, - 6 fast beeps per second.  6 fast beeps means the battery is in good condition.  I'm not sure why it's not stopping for you, but 5 things come to mind...    1) Perhaps the battery is no good or inserted incorrectly. Have you tried another battery or checked the polarity carefully?  2) Maybe when you inserted the battery, it was loose and triggered off another series of beeps. Happens.  3) See if there is a reset button on the camera... *some* cameras have one and clears the cache.  4) Have you referred to your camera's manual Troubleshooting section? Maybe it's covered in there.  5) Tried contacting Canon technical support? (last resort)    Good luck. Hope this helps.

c7d6dce8aeba6cba85ee582612d34f8caa	I don't believe that phones are specifically made to appeal to one gender.  Now, alot of times a phone will come with various colors, in which case obviously the colors such as pink or purple are going to appeal to the females mostly and other colors such as red, blue, etc. will appeal more to males.    The phone you put a link to looked pretty gender neutral.  So, I think that either a male or a female would be happy with it.  There is only a small bit of purple on it, and not enough to make a big difference to the overall look of the phone.|`|TdNVIKEtaa	Uni sexy phone !!|`|AA11796739	Are you a boy or girl first define it plz...... or both.....        http://advancetechnology.today.com/|`|gX0lCfiYaa	Doesn't really matter.

9uyY6szJaa	the receiver actually changes the voltage in the sat cable when you are changing channels. If you connect both cables together that wouldnt be good I guess :)  What is suggest if you can't spend on a diseqc to try to get a splitter with a switch built in. You can connect up both antennas to it to its two input and connect its one output to the receiver and then change the dishes with a switch on it.  I'm not sure this device exist but it suppose to work theoretically. If it doesn't exist or can't buy I suggest to build one. A few connectors, some wiring, a switch and some soldering.. Shouldnt cost more than a few quids at maplin.

But they can tell you rules. Like no drilling. No mounting the dish on the building. Your patio might not face south either. If it does, I would suggest mounting on a tripod and using flat cable to bring the cable inside the apartment. Call DTV and talk with them.

That may be a cover up for a future release but that doesn't matter in this case.  Point is that mini iPhone is a Chinese knock-off. So do not buy it under any circumstance.|`|459948c9c4124486ce62f73d24b95fe3aa	No, there is no mini iphone, you are getting scammed.  Be smart and buy it through a licensed dealer, like the Apple store and ATT.|`|XorzA99saa	DONT BUY IT! Its not a real iPhone.

AA11256390	As far as I know it's not available on PAYG (yet) but you'll pay upwards of 500 to get it SIM free. Be a little cautious if you see it a lot cheaper. Make sure it's genuine! You will be able to use all the features on it but will have to make sure whichever SIM you use in it has a decent data plan as this is very much an internet phone (WiFi will still be free). I really like this one and am seriously thinking of upgrading to it very soon

BMConIedaa	PS2 emulation on PCs is still very young.  Don't expect to run commercial games well, if at all.    A PC capable of playing any PS2 games would cost several times more than a PS2 actually costs.  You won't be able to find any video card for $150 that will make your PC more capable when it comes to PS2 emulation.    Just get a new PS2.  It will work better than any emulator out there.    Unless you like frustrating yourself.|`|HekFanRvaa	dude... a brand new PS2 is only $120... you actually have an extra money for 1 game...    to run PS2 on PC, you don't need to buy any hardware.. you only need a software and some skills using it.. it's called an emulator. google it..|`|g1JY9qQ5aa	This graphics card should suffice.  http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/...    +     You should get another 1gb of ram.

BhNP2P8Xaa	If your car stereo is capable of playing mp3 files (many modern ones are), then just copy mp3 files to the CD, and the stereo should be able to read and play them.    If not, your burning software should have a "CD Audio" option to burn songs to a CD. That will burn them in the CDA format used by compact disks.    Just remember that CDA allows you to only burn a certain number of tracks, while mp3 allows you to squeeze over 100 files on a standard CD, based on the song length.

More likely, you need to change some of your settings in your router.  To get to your router options, open a web browser and type 192.168.1.1 in the address line.  If you have not set up a user name and password, they should both be admin.  The Xbox 360 can help you trouble shoot this.  If you go to your network settings in your 360's main screen, you can run a test on your Xbox live connection.  The test should tell you if your router settings are keeping you from running optimally.  It should give you instructions on changing your settings, if not go to the 360's website as there should be help there.  Maybe someone knows what settings to change and can post them here.
kBSlNEL2aa	I know this is one that you have looked at already but I think if I gave you a little more accurate advice then it may change your mind.  I don't know if you were told this or if you just watched/played a different game but Elder Scrolls is not turn based.  It is a free-roam action RPG that isn't turn based (I know because I wouldn't play it either if it was...)  Elder Scrolls is a great game, it was one of the first games I bought for my 360, and I still play it today (1 1/2 years later)  So the replayability alone is enough to give this title another shot.  At least give it another try.  I did and it became one of my favorites.  Just a suggestion though.  One more thing it is also a older title so if you dont like it you arent wasting as much money as another title.|`|Rq0Ni0Ncaa	You should really check out Fallout 3.

Xxviy63Paa	The ps3 is smarter, faster, better looking and more charismatic. The ps3 was elected class President and the xbox was voted most likely to die a virgin in the school yearbook. The ps3 can cure cancer, old age, rid your house of cockroaches and mice, and cook your dinner. Sheepherders love the ps3 because it can shear an entire flock of 100 sheep in just one hour.    The xbox 360 on the other hand has single-handedly caused the global recession. It talks about you behind your back. When it gets the red ring of death, it's not a hardware malfunction - it does it on purpose.     There's your fanboy stuff.    Other than that, the ps3 is certainly the more powerful machine.

psZcFbClaa	No. The computer will know that you did NOT play through he whole campaign. There is this glitch called The Dashboard Glitch.    What you do is, get one of your friends to host a campaign on the last level. What YOU have to do is get on your 360 dashboard. He must host, and start a game and then invite you (or you click 'join session in progress). He must invite you ONLY WHEN THE BAR IS STILL ON THE SAFE-ROOM DOOR.     What this does is it tricks the computer. It thinks that he just started it and that you have JUST joined and that you have played through the whole compaign. You will get the achievement but the person who hosted WILL NOT.    AND YOU MUST BE IN A PARTY, ALL 4 OF YOU FOR IT TO WORK.    After that, you play throught he last level and you will get the achievement. (also good for plenty of other achievements).    Good luck.|`|tgT5MAO5aa	Im quite confident that is a negative amigo. The achievement is for surviving a campaign on expert, a campaign is 5 chapters, all of which will require you to survive in for the achievement.
6KJbfAD3aa	The only issue you might have is that if you bought any music from zune you would have to burn those to a CD to remove the DRM.
ada38d40b8a478e4e22c3765f3ad91e9aa	That depends entirely on how you're already set up.   If you already have a cable run into the house, and it's already connected and wasn't cut outside when it was last disconnected, then all he has to do is go in the house to set up the box.   Otherwise he will have to re-connect the cable going into the house.   If you live in a neighborhood where there are little boxes on the ground that distribute the cable to your house or group of houses, they probably cut or unplugged the cable inside the box and will have to re-connect there.
4NhIt64Uaa	first of all, its RONALDINHO.   it has to be the transfer season.. which is like august and january. (there's no guarantee that he will sign with you), but what you do is go to team management and go to transfers. hit search. on the very bottom, make sure it highlights ANY player, not just ones that are open for transfer. you can fill in the other things too like minimum overall rating and position. since ronaldinho's like an 88 or something in the game if you search correctly it should pull up only a few pages of players to look through (if not, you'll have to search through 2000+ pages of players to find him). so when you find him just click A and it should pull up a page that should allow you to offer him a contract.  you can edit the number of years and his salary per game and all that jazz. my recommendation is offer him at least a million dollars (euros, whatever) more than his current team is paying him. basically if you offer him a significantly better deal then he should sign. finish editing your offer, and hit submit bid for player. (for number of bids, put 2 or 3). now that you've made your bid for ronaldinho, you have to play your next game. for most transfers, you have to play a game in order for them to take effect. my suggestion is just simulate your next game. after it's done with the experience and all that crap, if ronaldinho liked your offer, you will recieve a letter in your box saying that "you have successfully signed _____________" (whoever you signed).  if not, you should reconsider how much you offered and maybe raise it. but thats pretty much what you do.|`|tzFkYLGqaa	Turn your cap locks off    email me for more info|`|9rvaMQ0eaa	the only way you're going to get him is by trading.
ZWHZto1Baa	Manufacturers release new tvs at different times every year.  Sony just released their new stuff, but Samsung will be updating their line of tvs in March.  It just depends.  Technology is very fluid and new stuff comes out everyday.  The best time to buy a new tv is when you need one and you can afford what you want.  If you keep waiting around for the "newest" technology you will never get a new tv.  There is always something new about to come out.
WiaMtrnyaa	Um if i remember right i think it is a custom head set for xbox360 i don't now the name tho sorry but if you are trying to look for a different head set that would work i don't think so because IF i REMEMBER right its a custom piece.
Mxe36NZEaa	this should help a bit    "Bluetooth: Dangerous Waves?"  http://www.businessweek.com/technology/c...|`|Xxviy63Paa	If you want to protect yourself from microwave radiation, you need to take a reflective material like aluminum foil and use it to cover up a big cardboard box, completely so there are no cracks or holes. Then get inside the box and stay there.    Microwave radiation in high doses can be harmful. Microwave radiation in low doses is something you've been getting since the day you were born. It is "radiation," but its frequency band occupies the spot right above ultraviolet radiation. Ultraviolet radiation can be harmful in high doses too. That doesn't mean radiation-suit harmful.     Microwaves are not gamma rays or x-rays. Relax.
15c03bf06cee5a4061edb3180eff2867aa	If you wish to upload, you have no other choice.    As the others have said, sorry...u'll have to use a firewire 400 cable to upload video from a miniDV to a PC on VISTA. This is possibly by Vista design...to avoid dropped frames~ video quality affected.    I wud agree to sparingly use USB if the upload process is done with a PC on XP. But still, there wud be possible degradation on video quality, then u'll finally go back to firewire 400.|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	Sorry minidv requires a firewire for download. Look in your manual and you find reference to an ieee 1394 connection.|`|AA11629848	Well Phil G, if you don't want to use firewire try Abracadabra. In MiniDV camcorders the USB is used to transfer pics (photos) not video, if you want to transfer video you must use the Firewire. USB works only with camcorders that record to Hard Drive or Flash memory.|`|x43Pj22Aaa	You can verify the driver by going into device manager but the reason that this is not working for use is because most apps don't recognize USB connections to camcorders other than for transfering pictures.    FYI data transfer with USB is too slow for it to work with video which is captured in real-time, that's why people tell you to use firewire.  You can add one to your computer for less than $30.    Another option is to just use a video conversion service.  Send them your video tape and get it back on DVD, or the digital files to edit.  StashSpace.Com does this for $7/tape|`|BsV2TQAvaa	Ok, then... just use firewire.  Sorry but let me explain. Usually you CAN'T do what your are trying to do.     Many camcorder/still camera hybrids have USB interfaces but only moving digital stills or low rez video clips stored in camera memory.  That doesn't have anything to do with moving video from the tape.     Usually, the only way to move video from MiniDV tape to your computer is via a firewire interface.   Just so you know, Firewire was created specifically for this purpose. USB was created to be a generic cover all interface and is not generally fast enough to move video reliably.      Nowadays, you can buy a Firewire port for your PC easily for under $50 and I promise you wont be dissappointed.

XFQQ0ZtXaa	I would say no.    Firstly, when you buy an iPhone, you are REQUIRED to buy a data plan to allow for stuff like web browsing and IMing. These plans can cost an upwards of $70 a month, so in the long run, you'll be spending more on your iPhone than you did on your PS3.    Second, if you're buying an iPhone solely for the games, then you should stop and save your money. Most of the iPhone games don't come anywhere close to the quality of PS3.|`|zblFCh7Paa	Yes or better yet but a 360|`|BXNqQKSWaa	Definitely, the iPhone is awesome! It does everything, you can get cool games, ipod, camera, etc.|`|1C3e4jCTaa	No way i mean first of all the iphone is way overrated and the graphics on the ps3 are way sweet!|`|aROiy2Gnaa	noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.

kXF6JBFLaa	You need to connect the BDP to the TV with either an HDMI cable or a set of component cables. You cannot get HD quality otherwise.|`|6676eb587e11ff37766d1b47e9cd96feaa	Go into your Menu, go to Picture adjustment and turn up your Sharpness.

Save your money, playstation is making money off people who spend there money on ps home. If I were you I would spend it on a couple games instead.|`|aTS9NoTNaa	You can sneak this :) The only thing they send you is a confirmation email like a kind of receipt so as long as you use your own email address it will be fine. If I were you though I would not waste money on Home, get WipEout hd or Warhawk or something.|`|j430ynCjaa	no nothing will come in the mail and its the same as having a itunes gift card....and grow some balls what would your parents do if they found out you made a PSN name? its free and what the christ could be wrong with it?|`|TEzP4ryAaa	if its a download then you shouldnt worry it will not send anything thats y gifts are so good. i love gift cards use them all the time so parents dont know what im buying aahhahaah.|`|TDScGEgkaa	why dont you just go to a shop nd buy the stuff with out going behingd your parents back and risking them finding owt...
4Pk6VNftaa	What are you talking about?    The analog to digital switchover has nothing to do with HDTV.  All it means is that the over-the-air signals will be changing their format.  As a result, if you use an antenna to receive your TV signals, you need to get a new tuner, commonly referred to as a digital TV  (DTV) converter.  Most DTV Converters cost $40.    To defray the costs of having to buy a the DTV converter, the government is offering up to 2 free coupons per household, good for $40 each, to be used to purchase a DTV converter.  You can go to DTV.org and sign up for the coupons.  The switchover has been delayed until June, partially because the government hasn't been able to send out the coupons fast enough.    If you have a cable or satellite TV subscription - even if you don't have a set-top box - you are not, I repeat, NOT affected by the switchover at all.        HDTV stands for High Definition TV.  This means they have higher resolution than the older standard TV sets.  A standard TV picture is made up of 480i individual lines, whereas a HD picture can have 720 or 1080 horizontal lines.  This allows for much clearer pictures with greater amounts of detail.    TV stations have begun to start broadcasting in HD, but will continue to broadcast in non-HD for quite some time.  Remember how long it took for TV stations to switch from black&white to color, or how long it took for stations to fully support stereo sound?  Yeah, over a decade in both cases.  I suspect it will be at least a decade before stations even consider dropping non-HD broadcasts.|`|b69Gm5fPaa	You DO NOT have to convert to Hi-Def. You only have to convert to digital. The government will issue a coupon for a converter bov if your tv is not digital.|`|IrqClfbcaa	First it has nothing to do with HD it has to do with digital T.V.  Basically if you have rabbit aka stealing someones cable you need a DTV converter box. If i have not explained this well enough go to http://www.komonews.com/about/dtv_answer... The main difference its in the picture its more clear.
OYwpLdoPaa	Two things could be wrong.      The little black stopper piece to the top left of the keyboard is missing or your screen is oversprung.  Did you by chance drop it recently?    Anyway, try tightening down the lcd screen.  If that doesn't help then you will need to remove it and turn the flip mechanism on the back of the lcd assy until the tension is right.    See the guide to help with the removal.  http://www.fixmysidekick.com/how-to-repl...|`|i171LlfTaa	I'd take it into the store, they are usually good with fixing problems, you wont have for phone for like two weeks though.
KyJkTcS8aa	Certain brands of camcorders use interchangeable batteries through their products.  For instance, a Canon XL1 camera uses the same kind of battery as a Canon XL2.  So even though your camera may not be sold at a camera store, you may find that they're selling your battery.  So the best bet would to try a local camera/camcorder store.  Or if you can do it online, then you can find it on ebay (http://cgi.ebay.com/Battery-For-JVC-GR-D... )|`|VC7waL4Aaa	Have a look at the website:  http://www.cheap-camcorder-battery.us  there are three kinds of battery that fit for gr-dvl520u  1  http://www.cheap-camcorder-battery.us/jv...  2  http://www.cheap-camcorder-battery.us/jv...  3  http://www.cheap-camcorder-battery.us/jv...  hope you can find you need one

If you're talking super zoom, you won't find it in a small camera.
