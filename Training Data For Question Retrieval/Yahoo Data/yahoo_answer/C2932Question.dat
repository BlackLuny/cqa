20090222183938AAbaGCq	Environment;Global Warming	Which is a greater threat to Mankind, "Global Warming" or "Frankenfoods"?	20 years ago, the consensus of scientists were warning about the dangers of genetically modified or GM foods and labeled the products as "Frankenfoods".  These products were to cause total crop failure, starvation, end of the world as we know it, blah, blah, blah...        Now the same groups have moved to "Global Warming" warning us that our actions could cause total crop failure, starvation, end of the world as we know it, blah, blah, blah...        Do you think the Frankenfood controversy is a bigger problem than Global Warming, or do you think Global Warming will be forgotten about when the next big issue takes its place?

20090222205105AAIH6sI	Environment;Conservation	Why do people refer to African countries as being over-populated?	Whenever people ask questions relating to Earth's natural resources, people say Africa is over-populated, or that Africans should have fewer children.      But Sudan's population density is 36 per square mile, making it the 194th most densely populated country. This doesn't sound like over-population.      South Africa has 101 per square mile. There are 169 more densely populated countries than South Africa.      122 countries are more densely populated than Ethiopia, with 181 per square mile.      Conversely, the UK has 637 per squaure mile (48th most densely populated) the Netherlands has 1025 per square mile (25th most densely populate)      In fact Rwanda is the most densely populated country in mainland Africa, with 829 people per square mile.
