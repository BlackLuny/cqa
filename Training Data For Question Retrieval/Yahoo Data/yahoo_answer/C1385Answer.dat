I've had friends, good and bad, who have come and gone.I had a very special friend. He and I went everywhere together, Games, Movies, Food places, Hiking, Fishing, Bowling, Work, in short everyplace. I knew this guy for 15 YEARS.  My friend met a girl who he fell in love with during a time I was "indisposed", a period of 2 months. My friend married this girl, had kids, got a house, and made a life for himself. I can't help but think that I was greedy and selfish to resent his life choices. But the true feelings I had were this...I was happy for him. Sometimes you have to let them free if you love them. Not a gay love, but a genuine feeling of tender feelings towards someone you care about. You can't have enough friends. Just don't smother them.

What is the maximum amount of hours you can take of field school? What kind of requirement do they have for lab work? What kind of lab/s do they have? GIS classes? What type of GIS/GPS devices do they use? (Trimble, etc) What type of Anthro-related organizations do they have? (Like an Anthro club or honour society). Also, you should go to the university and talk to Anthro students as they will be more likely to give you insider info that the professors might not know or think about. For example, if there are some professors that specialize in linguistic anth and that's what you want to do make sure that they are good teachers and that you will actually learn in their class. (I have taken courses that I was excited about, but the teachers were just not very good and I ended up disappointed)

c6eae266bb501e0a315d4b3e606f9c99aa	CP is more of a generic term for a number of different disorders.  As you probably know, there are a multitude of causes for CP, which is usually present at birth, but can also occur during early childhood.  Having CP is sometimes associated with lowered intelligence, but not always.  It is not the CP per se that results in lowered intelligence, but the damage to the developing brain may result in both.  If you were born with CP there may be a genetic cause and, in that case, your child would have some risk for also having CP (and any associated mental deficiency).  If you acquired CP during or after your birth, there would be no risk to your child.  So, if the damage to your brain which caused the CP on your right side also lowered your intelligence, neither could be passed on to a child.

AcgDcQG0aa	Yes, there are a lot of similarities between the causes of the Great Depression and the present recession.  <br>  <br>  In both cases, people borrowed too much money to buy various assets such as houses and stocks.  And in both cases many people have defaulted on their debts.  Which has made many banks insolvent and unable to fulfill their obligations.<br>  <br>  But there are some important differences too.  In 1930's, USA was a net exporter of goods to the rest of the world.  And it was a net lender too.  Which means that the position of USA was similar to that of today's Japan and China.<br>  <br>  In the present recession, USA is a net debtor and a net importer.  Which makes its position similar to that of western Europe in 1930's.<br>  <br>  And looking back at history, you will find that the Great Depression of 1930's was much more severe and longer in USA than it was in Europe and most other countries.   A lot of manufacturing jobs in USA were lost, just like Japan is loosing a lot of jobs now.  And the unemployment stayed high for more than 10 years.<br>  <br>  But in 1930's Europe, the depression lasted only 2-3 years.  And their unemployment never went as high as it did in USA.<br>  <br>  Since USA is in a different position now than it was during the Great Depression.  It's possible that the present recession won't last as long in USA as it will in Japan, China, and other manufacturing and exporting countries.<br>  <br>  But it's hard to say whether a coming improvement in the US economy will be permanent or temporary.  The US government is now doing many of the same things Japan did after its 1989 stock market and real estate crash.  It's propping up insolvent banks and companies to keep them from failing.  But these banks and companies remain in deep trouble.  And these companies keep absorbing economic resources from the government instead of producing economic growth.<br>  <br>  Perhaps the US economy will descend into a very long stagnation period without much economic growth but also without some of the extremes of the Great Depression.|`|c62bede4b148ea87fc523aa3f86eab76aa	1 : the great depression was cause not only by the economic situation but also by a freak weather.

The economic situation will come back up, it will probably be as high as it was but under a difference bubble. Just like the .com bubble, the mortgage bubble was next, another will come up.<br>  <br>  #4. economic stimulus plan help. sadly one of the best example is adolf hitler and his stimulus plan he had for germany pre WWII. another that worked was the new deal.|`|fofzdoROaa	1 & #2 The cause of economic slumps in general is greed that is expressed in the speculation of land values. This is common to all of the big business-cycle changes. During the business cycle land is the only quantity whose value steadily rises, whilst due to the laws of supply and demand and the existance of competition, the other manufacturered goods and services are fluctuating between comparatively small limits in their values. Eventually land is so expensive that nobody finds it worthwhile to speculate in and as business slackens the price suddenly drops.<br>  <br>  #3 The buble burst and was unrealistic, but another one will now start to grow for an 18 year cycle. The data on this has been studied by one single school of economic thought, see below.<br>  <br>  #4 The stimulus is not really such a thing because in order to help one fraction of the whole macroeconomy one must take from another. So it will be no use at all. At best, the resulting inflation will postpone the effects of the huge loss of government income, but we the tax payer and savers will pay the price in future years.
EKyO3FF2aa	Yes I do. Women at times use their body to get money, drugs, get out of a speeding ticket, seduce someone, and other things.

Have them do a complete blood check, urine, heart, lung examination, also sign up for a sleep clinic, this could simply be about not getting REM sleep, or sleep apnea. However at your age and your hieght it could be something else, such as hormones or a growth spurt.

This girl is a friend, don't read anymore into it at the moment, but become interested in her. If you tell her how much you appreciate her friendship, she will start to relax and perhaps you can begin asking her questions. Just start with "Why...". Begin asking everyone around you "why..." and "how..."

It is ok to be attracted to different people, but don't consider being like every other loser (beer) to potentially get one.  She is NOT worth that!  I adore quiet men.  Love it when they don't act stupid for attention.  I usually date a lot older guys, because they have passed through that phase.  You keep doing a good job at being you.  Sometimes the smaller churches can be fun and not demanding.  Go on Shoutlife (a Christian Facebook) just to have good people in your life.  Don't worry or try to change- some of us women really appreciate your type|`|hlvdPjeFaa	hey, that sounds just like me. i think too much, leaving very little space for speaking and that's why i'm kinda quiet and don't have too many friends. don't worry about it man. good things always have a way of coming back to you in the end.|`|48BM0yKGaa	Wow that was long!! But I honestly don't think you need to see a psychologist... Do you think that it might be because you were over shadowed by being 1 of five children? Where do you fall in that group youngest, oldest or the middle? There's nothing wrong about being quiet at all. And drugs and alcohol wont make it any better that's just an escape, are you going to drink and do drugs every day just to break out of your shell? If your comfortable being around this girl why dont you try to open up to her more, not saying spill your guts to her but take baby steps. I know it can be hard to have your voice be heard. But eventually you have to do it. Think of it something you want to do and make that your focus instead of always thinking about the things you cant do....|`|AgrVuahYaa	It sounds like you may be suffering from a little depression. DO NOT TURN TO ALCOHOL.  It may loosen you up--but it can also RUIN YOUR LIFE!  Go to the doctor for a check up and discuss anti-depressants.  And don't let others make you feel less just because you don't talk.  The world has need of calm, quiet people.  The girl--who knows!  Somewhere out there, there's a "chatterbox" just waiting to find a gem like you.  Be strong, and be happy being you!  Good luck!  NO ALCOHOL--it'll destroy you!|`|NjzUGZSuaa	Yasamf, don't change who you are for other people. Drinking and drugs will only hurt you ( mentally and physically ). You sound like a very sincere and good person and I am sure there are girls who like your type of personality. I am also very quiet and there have been people through my life that just don't understand and think that I am snubbing them ( though I really like and enjoy people). Just ALWAYS be your natural self and believe that you are a special creation of God.|`|ShgP7NBtaa	Hmm. That sounds a lot like me. However, interestingly enough with the girls at school I know first hand that being too quiet is a plus. The girls are generally attracted to quiet guys cuz they are so mysterious and distant so they want to be able to be that one who gets him to talk and to find out what his life is like. As far as the thinking there is NO such thing as thinking too much. People tell me I think too much at least once a month usually once a week. I say: "If you don't think too much, then you don't think enough". A lot of problems in this world is due to people not thinking enough. As far as the girl at work, I highly doubt she doesn't trust you and if not im sure it's not just cuz your too quiet. Otherwise she would've never talked to you to begin with now would she? Chances are either she just naturally doesn't go around with ppl she doesn't know TOO well. Or (and don't be offended cuz this is only a possiblity) she could just not be into you the way you like her and wants to be your friend or get to know you but doesn't want too lead you on. OR lastly she could have a bf and likes you too and wants you to realize she likes you but doesn't want you to know she has a bf who might have been coming to the restaurant or something. As for your main question. Of course you don't need a pyschologist. Everyone has their own personality of course some people are gonna be quiet doesn't mean their crazy. No drugs no alcahol are a good thing. And it's good to think a lot. People who think a lot are the one whose got technology as far as it is today. But never stress out about one situation. Thats not thinking too much. Thats stessing too much.|`|St6kmJ1laa	wow. thats a breath.. theres nothing wrong with thinking alot.. i do it all the time.. but if you have feelings that you wanna let out maybe you need a psychologist.. there is nothing wrong w/ u talking to a therapist..|`|X6xa3ZNmaa	That isn't a question but it's a life story =)<br>  <br>  You got uts posting that here, but really try to Talk about it with people you know, in a restaurant, the peoples you know ^__^, * i just read a few sentences* but take the girl out to a restaurant, just as colleagues.<br>  <br>  and you might  try i psychiatry if you want to spend all your hard earned cash on that.<br>  <br>  owh w8.... i am now reading the last part, first of all i tough you were like 30 / 40 or something, man you are 18! your life is just beginning, actually it really begins at the age of 21 but what ever. you might be 3 years ahead of the rest ;), go meet some friends, you really should go out to know how that feels, an get drunk to, you really should experience that, and drugs, just use soft drugs once a year. <br>  And no alcohol before work , if they catch you Your screwed, your brother is a softer , not saying you should use a lot of drugs now, but you might can help your bro.

If a quiet mind is at peace that can be desirable. If the mind is busy but lacks confidence, as if to think that you have nothing to contribute, but lots of thoughts, than it can be changed. We can become whatever we desire. "I've always been" is irrelevent, it has no meaning. You have the ability to change your personality, your character, your habits. But you must be willing. Sometimes discovering the reason you are quiet can help with corrective healing. Was it when you were a child, having several brothers and sisters that you were not heard, or possibly called names that made you withdrawal ? Regardless, whatever the situation, forgive, and love, yourself and everyone. You have something to contribute, you have purpose. Yet this impression of you being a  deep thinking person, perhaps inspires me to offer this suggestion. Seek for answers to the questions, or thought that you are having, not the negative thoughts, but the wonderous thoughts. This is too big a subject to answer via email, so refer to the list of resources. When we awaken to the "Self" in us, the God in us, your spirit self which is of God, it is transforming. This awakening can open conversation, because it is of great value. Some of us get bored with trivial conversation or "small talk", it doesn't inspire, or energize. When you discover the inner longing, you will find your place. Conversation will come, but not to be the focus. Understand this, deeper levels of awareness is usually not a majority existance. Typically few people delve into th deep places of the soul, into the deep places of truth. Truth will always lead to the natural state of your being.It will benefit you immensely, but do take action. Blessings Ray

AcgDcQG0aa	I don't think anybody knows the opinions of the whole society.   Because society is not a single person or a uniform group of people but a diverse nation with many different groups and many differences of opinion about various things, including the freedom of speech.<br>  <br>  The constitution is supposed to protect people's freedom of speech even when most people in society don't like this kind of freedom.  But in practice, the constitution can be bent, interpreted, and unenforced in various ways according to the whims of the current government.  And that's why the freedom of speech in USA varies from one government to another and from one period in history to another.<br>  <br>  Suppressing the freedom of speech can make it difficult for people to change their government and the way things are done in the economy.  And if the government and the economy are being mismanaged.   Then people's inability to change things can be very costly for them indeed.|`|fofzdoROaa	This is not a question about economics since the kind of speech that should be supressed varies from individual to individual. <br>  <br>  This kind of speech is the kind that is offensive or likely to embarass the second party, which is not possible to define for the communuity at large.

There were six people in my house growing up.  I cooked my own meals, did my own laundry, and had my own bathroom.  My brothers cooked their own food, same as my parents and step sister so I guess we used a lot of water.  But why in the world would someone penalize families for using to much water, they is plenty of it to go around, lol|`|fofzdoROaa	I suppose that the smaller families use more water per person than the large ones. Of course in total amounts the larger the family the more water used. Provided that the volume of water is measured and the cost of it is in direct proportion to this quantity, that is price per cubic meter is constant regardless of quantity, then the penalty is automatically there.<br>  <br>  But if water is paid for on some different basis other than quantity, then the point made in the newspaper article may have some merit.
NGrOwP9vaa	i don't know what the other person is going on about ,Anyway, 50% of black families are matriphocial in structure, meaning they are female headed. Black children are predominately raised by female members of the family e.g mum, aunties etc. The men of black afro-caribean families are highly promiscuous thus many black children have absent fathers. <br>  White families have seen an increase in single mothers who make up around 20% i think. However the dominant family type for whites is still the nuclear ( ideal, mum, dad and a child/ren) which makes up 37%.  Lol i know this is a lot but my exam was on the family, hope this helps you out|`|9w9Q83tFaa	Sounds a bit racist and political correctness gone mad, do black people have different perspectives within the family and if so how are these affected by immigration?<br>  As far as I am concerned the black people have greater family ties and more cohesion as a family unit than say whites.<br>  For this reason the white race is dying all over Europe because of birth control and abortion.<br>  Further more what shade of black are we talking about here?<br>  No wonder our education system has gone to pot.
AcgDcQG0aa	Yes, I agree that there is a big problem with the way the economy works now.  And something needs to be changed.  It doesn't make sense to continue as before, when things are clearly falling apart.<br>  <br>  But changing things just for the sake of change also doesn't make sense.  The only kind of change that makes sense is where the root causes of the current problems are clearly identified and fixed.<br>  <br>  I think the root cause of the present crisis is too much diversification of investments.  Vast majority of investors spread their investments over tens and in many cases hundreds of different companies.  And for this reason they usually cannot watch closely the companies they own and change the management of these companies, when the management starts making bad decisions.<br>  <br>  A lot of managers and executives of failed companies came millionaires and billionaires out of this crisis.  While the shareholders and the taxpayers are left holding the empty bag.  <br>  <br>  And this kind of thing has to change.  The owners of companies need to take more responsibility for the companies they own.  And one way to encourage that would be to give tax breaks to investors who put most of their money into one or two companies instead of diversifying their investments.  And tax a lot all those investors who diversify their investments a lot.|`|64515c9dd3f1d42fce2093056b18e17aaa	it's all about the dollar with capitalism. but not to worry. the dollar is worth pennies now, and our economic health is flat lining.<br>  <br>  between special interests and politics gone awry, we're in a sad state.<br>  <br>  i'm open to suggestions, but i don't see this improving.|`|fofzdoROaa	Your definition is inaccurate.

WW6G2Pjiaa	That is an excellent question which hasn't been fully answered yet. From what little general knowledege we have it seems dreaming or deep REM sleep is a necessary biological function for all of the planet's fauna. It is a temporary fugue state in which the mind and body balance various chemical processes and allows body tissues time to regenerate from everyday use. As to why this is a necessary function, no one can definitively state, but research does and should continue. When in REM sleep, the brain releases a flood of a naturally occuring chemical called DMT or Dimethyltriptamine which causes dreaming. It is the singularly most powerful hallucinagen known to man and is the very same substance the brain produces just prior to death, hence the report of many near-death experiences involving bright lights in tunnels and visitations from dead relatives. I have no official explanation for the inability of people to remember the experience afterward, but the are a few resources out there that can help shed some light. Again an excellent question and I can only hope you'll  continue to research.|`|48H83SQ0aa	I also find it very strange i belive it is often a insight into the future and when the event we dream about happens we remember for a second and often forget again... other times its just are brain still active while we are at rest. the reason we forget so easily is because right when we wake up are entire real world hits us your alarm goes off or someone wakes u, think about that report or have to use the rest room|`|MbKQ5Xc0aa	hi, there are many theories for dreams for eg brain tries to organize our memory, our hidden motives or some stress. however dreams occur in REM stage i.e rapid eye movement. one of the cycles in the sleep. <br>  <br>  1-to remember thing working memory should be activated e.g the way you remember the new phone number by repeating till you write it down<br>  <br>  2-or it be learnt by experience or practice . <br>  <br>  these thing don't occur in sleep. the above are couple of  reasons|`|AA10554783	A dream is the sub conscience mind at work, it's hard to remember them because they are not in a sequence but scrambled memories put together when a person is in the rem stage of sleep.|`|6dL7UGvfaa	One of the meaning of dream is that it is an hallucinatory wish fulfillment of forbidden desires. It is not remembered because it is a taboo in waking life and for the same reason dreams are in disguised/symbolic form to conceal the unacceptable wishes.|`|RuOTJLyvaa	We have two minds, the concious mind that we use while we are awake and dealing with reality and the subconsious mind that deals with whats inside ourselves. Unless your on a hallucinogenic drug or something the two minds rarely function at the same time so while your awake your sub conciouss is sleeping and while you are sleeping it is awake and active while your conciouss rests. <br>  You would be able to remember your dreams perfectly if both minds could operate at 100% all the time... but that might also make you a crazy person.|`|hlvdPjeFaa	dreams are the work of your subconscious mind. when you're constantly thinking of something, you tend to dream about it. dreams also tend to mix up a lot of things you think about. its difficult to remember because when you wake up you're using a different part of your mind. there're also rumours that when you can't remember a dream, its most likely to come true.|`|1c86c643d856d73261365b03e0ce86d3aa	Mr. Peter is pretty much right about the two mind concept besides the fact that most people on the subject currently agree on three parts of the mind.....long story .......<br>  <br>  To answer ur question....well i really can't cuz the debate still goes on.  The most widely believed  concept is that dreams are a way to uncover suppressed feelings to your own self.  Also nobody has the slightest idea why you can't remember you dreams but it's common knowledge that if awaken during you REM cycle you do remember your dreams because that is when they occur.|`|AA12155794	Dream usually remains in subconscious mind.It comes in the surface when we fell asleep and what we think,desire and come across in day time it reflects in te dream.<br>  When we woke up then we are in reality and our mind starts working,<br>  the episode in dream we forget.
5KNUCGHtaa	I totally agree with you man. If a girl kicks a guy in the groin area its funny to others but when a man grabs a woman by the arms its called battery. I really don't see why they say men and women are equal.|`|YUU6DS3haa	when feminists hurt men, they all laugh about it and spend all day just agreeing with each other<br>  <br>  when men use self-defense from violent feminists, they say men are evil, wife beating child molester rapists.<br>  <br>  its not at all "equal"<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AvF9hiD1Kl1js_b04le8r1jsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304034550AAIjBe8">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  look at NATALY'S response here<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AvbDFPUAaf3l54D3Ioq7qncYxgt.;_ylv=3?qid=20090304025731AAOrJkD">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: i have no quams about kicking a feminist in the crotch.....the only drawback is, my foot would get stuck there|`|yzhm0AzIaa	You know its probably the guys who are doing the belly laughs at those videos.   I really can't name any advertisement that uses this as a tactic to increase sales.|`|O6EqTO6vaa	Because some women think they can get away with that behavior. I don't find it very lady like and if a woman always hits guys, she has some serious issues. =)|`|8s3rMWojaa	Yeah these women are diabolical and full of malice. Their idea of chivalry is that Guys must get beaten up and humiliated by them. And to top it all off they play victim also..........(Applause)|`|66tTuuIFaa	You seem to be forgetting that men also take a certain delight in seeing other men get hit in the groin. <br>  I seem to remember a distinct game play by young men when I was a kid called grabulation. It's where a guy would walk up to another guy, grab his crotch and then pull and twist as hard as he could.<br>  Men also frequently state male rapists and child molesters should have their junk cut off.<br>  <br>  The point is, it's not women or rather it's not just women who openly promote this activity and if you are getting your "evidence" and "statistics" from yahoo answers then you are getting a screwy analysis indeed because this place is home to  trolls and sociopaths who delight in providing shocking and disturbing answers.<br>  <br>  Yes I agree pain and mutilation to the male genitals must stop but you sir are going about it in the wrong way and you're in fact reinforcing the belief that this activity is fun.<br>  <br>  The only time punching/kicking a man in the crotch is acceptable is when you are being assaulted yourself as this is an effective method that allows you to incapacitate the man long enough to make a get away.<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  You're reinforcing it because you are frantically trying to prove your point on an anonymous website to a bunch of deluded psychopaths who think everything in life from murder, to punching babies to kicking men in the testicles is funny. You're offering no plausible solution to this problem, just pointing fingers like any silly old feminist. <br>  You're becoming a borderline fanatic and essentially the way you talk (or type really) says to me and many others than you are about doing anything other than looking at the problem logically and attempting to solve it. <br>  On a side note-it's funny how MRA and feminist movements become the antithesis of what they originally started out at. This might be why I don't hold a high opinion of anyone who willingly aligns themselves with such groups. <br>  It's a known fact men double women in higher media positions. Men just seem to covet these positions more. These men therefore have authority over what is produced and shown on tv so it's reasonable to say these men take some blame in what is shown to others and what makes both men and women believe it's acceptable to assault someone for entertainment purposes. <br>  Setting up meetings with these men first and foremost would go a long way to help combat this problem. Discuss the issues and try to reasonably show them why this is a problem. If that doesn't work you then start protesting incessantly in front of their office. Hand out flyers to people walking on the street. Even if you help just one or two people see the light, you've done a good thing. Meanwhile you continue to educate the average man and woman on how harmful it can be to hit a man in the crotch. It can cause cancer, brake the penis and other severe and often debilitating problems. <br>  Yahoo Answers isn't going to help you solve the worlds problems.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  oh and your instance of "sport" and my instance of "sport" shows how this phenomenon varies from place to place. Which also leads one to believe this isn't as one-sided as you'd like it to be.|`|9679eed4decfc91fdcea2e17ae362313aa	I don't really think its funny when a guy gets hit in the balls. I do not like to see my guy double up in pain if I accidentally knee him there.<br>  <br>  Ive never seen girls laugh at guys getting hit in the balls. I think that is more of a guy thing. my guy friends would kick each other in the nuts. what a bunch of retards.<br>  <br>  If you want to kick a woman in the crotch in self defense if she is sexually trying to molest you and you are saying no I say go for it.<br>  <br>  Just like if a man tries to molest me he is going to get a kick in the nads too.<br>  <br>  objective - can you seriously stop fantasizing about feminists crotches for one second? ... disturbing.|`|f0a3d59262cb942ba6463d8c525a1cd8aa	You're right Twiglets, and moreover, you're brave for standing up and speaking this truth because since it's women who decide who gets to have sex with them, any man who dares to say something women they don't like is routinely punished for it i.e. they tend to leap irrationally to conclude you're a misogynist & maliciously spread the word rather than coolly and rationally recognise that all you've done is fairly point out an inequality.<br>  <br>  Women find this acceptable because they're inherently selfish.  As such, they act like psychopaths when it comes to the feelings of others *where they don't have an interest* e.g. a woman may respond with compassion towards a hurt animal if she thinks it's cute but she'll have it skinned if she wants to wear it's fur.  She may consider a partner's feelings when buying him a birthday present because she herself enjoys buying it, gets personal pleasure from seeing him respond lovingly when he receives it; & she makes a mental note of her 'generosity' in the event the man's gifts, when it's his turn to buy them, aren't up to scratch; but she'll rip his heart out if she chooses to dump him.<br>  Moreover, women have no possibility of ever appreciating the pain a man experiences upon being hit in the testicles; they genuinely have no frame of reference for it and this can incline them to think it 'no big deal' to laugh when it happens.  <br>  <br>  I'm sure you won't be fooled by the 'morally correct' answers from women here.  If you lurk on women's message boards e.g. 'expecting a baby' on the BBC website, you'll get to see how women are casually vindictive and misandric in reality; they make sweeping comments about how all men are stupid, useless, worthless, only think with their *****, etc.  None of these female answerers here will go away and start to speak out against such talk, or against those adverts, or stop casually advocating a 'good swift kick in the balls' here and there. Not to mention that there's not a jot of evidence of a single women, anywhere, doing anything to stamp this out or get real equality.<br>  <br>  Certainly men are better than women morally and intellectually (and by intellectually I mean everything that humans have ever achieved).  In every field of human endeavor men have been so much more successful than women that it's an embarrassment to them.  Ask anyone, man or woman, to name a single female genius.  Most will reply with Marie Curie (who did nothing without her brother) and then they will start to mumble.<br>  Even the rape laws were made and enforced by men - but women generally lack the strength of character to acknowledge the truth of this either.<br>  <br>  N.B. That (apparently) some men seem to think it funny when a man gets hit in the testicles doesn't make it any less acceptable for women to make light of it.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	I can't imagine that most women find that acceptable.<br>  Some perhaps, but most? I don't know about that.|`|abx5VNsOaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nxm6wPon5ic" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nxm6wPon5...</a><br>  2 wrongs don't make a civil right,....and i don't advocate any violence towards either sex,but ,well watch and you will see,lol.|`|fH2Fw4QEaa	You, my friend, get a star for asking an excellent question!<br>  <br>  I really don't know why 9 times out of ten, women or anyone else for that matter would make fun of the traumatizing or misfortune of another.<br>  <br>  I guess it's just the world we live in, but it sure as hell doesn't make it right and I agree that if we men dared to do such a thing or treat them the way they treat us at times, they'd be more than "up in arms" about it.<br>  <br>  Good question.|`|sfn6SpbCaa	Well, it's not acceptable. Call me what you wish; it's more lady like for us to scream, scream as loud and as shrilly as we can. We are not men, so we'd better stop acting like one.|`|oojO4WAraa	Most women DO NOT find battery acceptable.  And what advertisement are you discussing?  I have never seen an ad with a guy getting kicked in the balls.|`|iRKOJhYeaa	You know nothing of the "average woman". The women on here do not represent the "average woman".

There are some guys who want their wives to have the biggest, most visible ring so that other men can see that they are married. So if there are guys who use rings to treat their wives like property I can see why some women would be opposed to it.<br>  <br>  And to Know It All: The movie blood diamonds is not about what is happening in diamond mines today. That move is set about 10-15 years ago, it is not current.|`|00yHUtXuaa	Feminists, like all women, lust after wedding rings. That's why DeBeers pioneered the "right hand ring". It's a ring for women too b_tchy (i.e. feminists) to get married. So they buy a ring for themselves.|`|1pup885baa	I don't know about radical feminists (I don't actually know any), but I know plenty of feminists who happily wear wedding rings.

Your dream may be alerting you to something in your waking life that you are not aware of or that has not yet surfaced. Alternatively, the snake may be seen as phallic and thus symbolize temptation, dangerous and forbidden sexuality. If you are afraid of the snake, then it signifies your fears of sex, intimacy or commitment. The snake may also refer to a person around you who is callous, ruthless, and can't be trusted. As a positive symbol, snakes represent healing, transformation, knowledge and wisdom. It is indicative of self-renewal and positive changes.? <br>  <br>  I am not sure if this is what you are asking.|`|yQdA5rHnaa	symbolically it refers to knowledge
8d8ejHPfaa	Hm.  Well, I'm not sure what to say about the blackness, but when your mind wakes up before your body, it's called sleep paralysis, it happens to a lot of people from time to time.  When you enter REM sleep, your body goes into a paralyzed state, I'm not sure why, maybe it's to keep you from moving around in your sleep as you interact with your dream, maybe that tendency is overruled in a situation such as sleepwalking.  If you come out of a dream too suddenly before your body can catch up, you may feel paralyzed, and people often panic when they don't know what's going on there. There are many websites about sleep paralysis, here's an entry to get you started...<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_paral...</a>|`|kB63WTfdaa	I had the dream of paralysis as well once...arguably one of the scariest cause I thought I was awake.  15 years later I still walk just fine.

AA10696234	Hello, i'm so sorry to hear what you have been through, but to me, you sound like a girl with her head screwed on, despite your difficult up bringing. I think it IS assertive to take the decision not to speak to people who don't contribute anything positive to your life. You don't need the baggage that will come with having a relationship with your mother. Will you get anything positive from it, or will she just drain you emotionally? <br>  Maybe in the future things will change, your mother might change.<br>  But i would advise you to look after yourself, love yourself, give yourself the best chance you can at happiness, value yourself and enjoy your life now and look forward to the future. <br>  As for your brother, if he makes you feel bad most of the time, you don't need him in your life. <br>  You don't HAVE to speak to your family if you don't want to . do what feel right to you in your heart and head. <br>  I wish you much happiness<br>  Take Care <br>  Jo|`|yH7OsFm8aa	You have a reason, and it must be hard on you as well. I think you should get your mom some professional help. As much as you don't wanna talk to her, if you're going to do anything get her help. Not only will it make things better for her, but you too. <br>  <br>  It's all your choice. You sound like you've been through a lot. You'll be okay.|`|ADCbRlbeaa	No offense, but why do you need to ask?? HELL NO you don't have talk to them! That's horrible, I get that your mom obviously needs help but what your brother said was just plain mean and insensitive. Your better off without them, and yeah your mom sounds like she needs help :[ not that, that's your responsibility nessacarily.|`|oojO4WAraa	Your mother sounds mentally ill.  Sometimes to save yourself you have to avoid certain people that, unfortunately, you are related to.  <br>  <br>  Your brother sounds like a jerk.  I wouldn't feel bad about not speaking with him.  He might mature someday and be okay.<br>  <br>  Usually I would say it is irrational no to talk to family members, but maybe in your case it is the best thing for you.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  You should visit with a counselor and talk about this stuff so you can move forward with your life without feelings of conflict and guilt.|`|suPEpuItaa	You don't have to LIKE the members or your family or talk to them if you don't want to.  I don't see how you can live with your brother and NOT talk to him however.  You should see about moving away from him and then you're under no obligation to ever speak to either one again.  Just my opinion, of course.
ewybA08Iaa	Please, is it possible for you and those folks who fear feminism to allay your fears?  I never cease to be amazed by the ignorance surrounding feminism.  PLEASE READ AND ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT. With rare exception, feminists do not seek dominion over males, and or civilization.  Power over is not their goal.  Ya know, so many males are absolute hypocrites when dealing with feminism.  They still seek to be the dominant partner in a marriage support the suppression of equal opportunity for females in the employment market, but relish in the increase of the quality of their life style because of the income of their wife. BUT, they do not want their wife to earn a larger salary than them.  Boys get over it.  We are simply equal.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	I don't want someone to do things for me unless I'm paying them and they're licensed for it. As far as I'm concerned, men should be whatever they want.|`|7LSonIoraa	they would make us slaves|`|AHJZeo8Oaa	What should be the role of man in a feminist world?<br>  <br>  Human.  Like us all :-)|`|nPHCPX1Xaa	we should just continue being better than feminists
wbIEau0qaa	yes, we are<br>  <br>  i have always thought of myself as an intelligent and attractive man. when i date, i was usually the better looking partner, or atleast the more confident, and the relationship usually went the way i wanted. <br>  <br>  then two years ago i started dating the most beautiful woman ever. she challenges my intellect, she is motivated, a go getter, she works out, she is more popular and more indepedent than any woman i have ever known plus every guy she knows has a crush on her. <br>  <br>  at first, i thought i could get along smoothly with this, as now the sides have flipped, i am in her world, around her family and friends and she is the one who takes the lead in almost every scenerio. but i found out, it was harder, and if i really did love her i would have to put more effort into making things work out. <br>  <br>  now, it seems like i'm all out of answers, the relationship has gone from great to poor, to good to poor. so many ups and downs, i feel threatened by her great looks. so yes, she gets hit on all the time but she doesnt have the decency to ignore, becauses shes such a great and nice person inside, she talks to everyone and anyone. shes always re assuring me that i am the only one she loves, but it makes it difficult for me especially when she is totally ignoring me when we are out, atleast thats how i feel, she may not be doing it intentional, but she isnt making things any better by being bliss about it. <br>  <br>  my advice, give your man a little more attention, you dont need to be attached to him but give him more eye contact, give him a physical touch every now and then, and show him PUBLICALLY, he is your man.|`|zXIhB8Ycaa	It's obvious he has a self-esteem issue.  Maybe he has had little success in love before and simply doesn't know how to handle things when he has some success.<br>  <br>  I would recommend the book "The Secrets Men Keep".

Popularity is a H.S. status, It doesn't mean anything in the real world.|`|3FfPHRGtaa	some cliques are real cliques where real friends stick together. i've seen some of my friends do that and they are rather close. but of course, someone will be the most dominant, and someone will feel more left out.<br>  <br>  from what you described, the clique you are talking about is like playing a game. i wont be sure if they are true friends if i were you. some people find comfort in numbers. i have this friend who got 'attacked' by all 3 other members of her clique and that really broke her. so yes, they do betray each other. <br>  <br>  if gossip, bullying and labelling really common in the place the clique is from, then i guess when they have no other targets they target on their own members. if popularity is a big deal there, then i guess that is their drive.<br>  <br>  from where i come from, we dont think much about popularity, but gossip still spread like the way gossip should. if the clique is your clique and they are 'attacking' you, i advise you to get out of there. go find some other true friends.
gLH0gcXtaa	Steer clear away from them until they get professional help. It's the only way they'll get better, and you'll not become emotionally unhealthy from the interaction. Good luck.
nvH62xo5aa	Yes.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	Self forgiveness is important.<br>  But I also think it's important to at least seek the forgiveness of those you've wronged. If they're unwilling to give forgiveness you have to find it within yourself.<br>  <br>  My conscience doesn't allow me to wrong someone without seeking forgiveness. No regrets.|`|P1VXjLPOaa	Guilt is a good quality, to bad it's in short supply. It's an indication that that you know you have done wrong. Most people today no longer feel shame. They are unable to discern between right and wrong. Ultimately, seeking forgiveness is more important than forgiving oneself.|`|9gMQAWBNaa	Everyone has some regrets, if they do not they are likely not people who think and consider and look inside very much. It's important to forgive oneself but difficult in the scheme of things, you can spend your entire life doing so.|`|OhYE3GhKaa	what a great question. my first response would have to be important to whom? when it gets down to shame, it is a good thing if we feel shame if we do something that hurts someone. or do something really skeezie.

I said: ‘I shall make confession over my transgressions*** w75 4/1 p. 212 par. 17 The Voice of Conscience Within ***<br>  <br>  the conscience can become deadened if it is repeatedly ignored or suppressed. The apostle Paul wrote about men “whose consciences are as dead as seared flesh.” (1?Tim. 4:2, J. B. Phillips) Such men, without pangs of conscience, could lie, act hypocritically or intentionally mislead Christians, as Paul said<br>  <br>  Most people have done things they are sorry for and sometimes more than once, the same thing.|`|nUbtafV6aa	maybe im the only one but i've done some nasty things to people and i have nightmares because i can't forgive myself, we try to be good people but at the end of the day we are only human, forgiveness to ones self as well as to others is in my opinion equally important|`|AA11626101	A lot of people need guilt and shame in order to LEARN not to make the same mistakes twice. Some people need more guilt and shame than others.<br>  <br>  No use in forgiving yourself if you haven't learned your lesson yet. If you have, move on.|`|00yHUtXuaa	Agreed, but rather than forgiving yourself (which is an exercise in narcissism), you should seek forgiveness from God and make amends to your neighbor for your actions.|`|9679eed4decfc91fdcea2e17ae362313aa	sometimes not forgiving yourself is a true sign of remorse.|`|9VAnsWYUaa	I'm my own God.<br>  <br>  I don't blame myself ergo I don't have to forgive myself. What happens, happens because of someone's stupidity, and that wouldn't be mine.<br>  <br>  Blue, yes, I'm perfection personified. :-)|`|YQOT68xFaa	I think they are almost equal in importance, with seeking forgiveness being slightly more important. Yes, we need to forgive ourselves. That really is a big deal. But it's even more important to make amends with others that we have hurt. That brings healing to them as well as yourself.<br>  <br>  <br>  Know It All - Really? You're your own god? And you never screw up or make mistakes or do the wrong thing, ever?

Women had things like reticules, and they were far more dainty and feminine than a man's money pouch. <br>  <br>  Men can wear a purse if they like, but since there aren't really purses made specifically for men they'd have to carry a woman's purse, and most straight men don't really want to do that. lol|`|nnwbxPKfaa	Seeing how boys go all the way through college carrying all their stuff in back packs you would think the man purse would catch on.

As a man myself, I don't and wouldn't mostly because I don't like walking around with something hanging on my shoulder all day. I like to move about freely without having to worry about what I'm carrying and what important elements are inside. I don't even use  my wallet, I just carry the two or three cards I need in my pocket.<br>  <br>  The only thing I would need a "purse" for are those man purses that people carry laptops in. But I don't have a laptop. And if I did, I'd try to find something cool to carry it in, like something that made me look like a badass special agent or something. Not like an asexual emo dude with a man-purse. If girls have the options of choosing how feminine their purse looks, why can't I choose how masculine and cool my "purse" looks?<br>  <br>  EDIT: Lets not forget the obvious reason why most men don't use their "right to wear purses" is because both men AND women would make fun of them, and call them gay, possibly get beat up. When a woman carries a purse, especially an expensive or flashy looking one, they get praise for it. If men got the same praise, and it was easier for them to get girls for it, I'm sure more men would carry it.

Ironically, I spend more time in the kitchen than she does.<br>  <br>  I should call the cops on her because she decided that she wants Giallo Ornamental granite instead of a basic Uba Tuba.

The only advice I have is to surround yourself with "good people" and forget about all the other idiots out there. I have a theory that the world is made up of about 98% idiots and assholes. So just try to find a few friends that fall into the other 2% (if you don't already know some) and forget about the rest.

People in general are selfish creatures that don't follow common sense, but at the same time, they are full of good intentions.  Spend some time in charities with those less fortunate, and take a more philosophical approach.  Most people generally don't mean to be manipulative or hurtful - just that they take a different perspective that you.|`|e640e5fc04f1c4da3326c5429e707bdcaa	Good for you for seeking to break out of a cycle. We learn early in life the ways in which we react and act. If those around you have always seen the world as a wonderful warm place, and have supported you fully and you are feeling this way ---then get help. It could be a chemical imbalance. <br>  If you have had a tough time, then you might be reacting in a habitual form in a way that is perfectly natural given what you know. You can change this. I recommend "As a Man Thinketh" by James Allen, and "The Law of Attraction" and 'the Celestine Propecy". It will help get you to a place where you can reframe your reactions because you have a deeper understanding of human nature. <br>  Life Coaches are good at helping people through this, but you can also read and keep a journal to honor your journey. Remember that your life experience holds the opportunity to choose how you react or act, or resist acting. In all the world's imperfection is the perfect environment for spiritual development...in this the world is perfect.

To such ends, it has been wildly successful for the last 2 centuries, but in order to preserve this system, we allow, (tolerate), views that the majority may find offensive.

The shark may also be an aspect of your own personality which exhibit these qualities. <br>  <br>  Sometimes it's not always the symbols in the dreams, but moreso the overall feel of the dream.

PWPLrUFZaa	Years ago two of my friends died in a bike crash. They were both cremated on the same day in towns that were nearly 100 miles apart, one at 11 am, the other at 1 pm.<br>  <br>  Loads, apart from the grief, made me so angry that day that I have often regretted going to either funeral.<br>  <br>  First up, Johnny who was estranged from his foster family and hadn't lived with them since he went into care at 13 (he died aged 20) and upon his death they appeared and took his body to their hometown for the funeral, a town he had never in his life been to. They cared more for his death than they had for his life.<br>  The guy that Johnny worked for had treated him like his son and he was going to arrange for Johnny's funeral to be held locally, but no! the so called family had to interfere.<br>  When I got there these strangers who had disowned Johnny were all sat in the front rows and me and the guy who had looked after Johnny had to stand at the back with others who had known him longer and better than anyone else.<br>  Resentment, not grief was my dominant emotion, and I resented that too.<br>  <br>  Once the service had finished we were all required to overload the cars with passengers and speed back home for Alan's funeral. The irony that we were risking our lives by driving so dangerously to attend the funerals of those who had died in a traffic accident was not lost on us.<br>  <br>  All in all, I felt pretty s##t that day.<br>  <br>  The following night we had our own party or wake and we sat around with guitars and drums and everyone sang songs with tears in their eyes, but with some joy in their hearts that finally we had found someway that felt right to say goodbye to our friends.<br>  <br>  I still miss them.|`|OXxKTM6vaa	Maybe raise money in his honour (a football game for charity or something) & give it to a charity that prevents children/teenagers from hanging themselves/self harming.

zxKCVXPZaa	Emergency management (or disaster management) is the discipline of dealing with and avoiding risks.<br>  <br>  [1] It is a discipline that involves preparing for disaster before it occurs, disaster response (e.g. emergency evacuation, quarantine, mass decontamination, etc.), as well as supporting, and rebuilding society after natural or human-made disasters have occurred.<br>   In general, any Emergency management is the continuous process by which all individuals, groups, and communities manage hazards in an effort to avoid or ameliorate the impact of disasters resulting from the hazards.<br>   Actions taken depend in part on perceptions of risk of those exposed.<br>  <br>  [2] Effective emergency management relies on thorough integration of emergency plans at all levels of government and non-government involvement. Activities at each level (individual, group, community) affect the other levels. It is common to place the responsibility for governmental emergency management with the institutions for civil defense or within the conventional structure of the emergency services. In the private sector, emergency management is sometimes referred to as business continuity planning.<br>  <br>  Emergency Management is one of a number of terms which, since the end of the Cold War, have largely replaced Civil defense, whose original focus was protecting civilians from military attack. Modern thinking focuses on a more general intent to protect the civilian population in times of peace as well as in times of war. <br>   An academic trend is towards using the term disaster risk reduction, particularly for emergency management in a development management context.|`|nVhP1Bteaa	An oxymoron.
8d8ejHPfaa	Hi Denise, yes it is a common dream.  That you are trapped suggests that you have a problem or situation you feel trapped by, and helpless to do anything about.

The breathing becomes deeper and the body becomes paralyzed, preventing us from acting out our dreams, i.e. sleep walking/talking etc. We are subconsciously aware of this during sleep, and therefore this paralyzed state is incorporated into our dreams, which is why we often have dreams where we're rooted to the spot or cannot make sound.|`|AA11626101	It's your subconscious telling you to shut up.<br>  <br>  Seriously.<br>  <br>  At least that's what I make of it.|`|874EAxkfaa	if you are scared enough,you will scream,at least groan.

Khwt4oL6aa	To dream about a former crush, refers to that particular period in your life and what you were feeling. The former crush represents a point in time when you first had the crush on that person.<br>  <br>  To dream that you are having a telephone conversation with someone you know, signifies an issue that you need to confront with that person. This issue may have to do with letting go some part of yourself.<br>  <br>  To see your mate's ex in your dream, suggests that you may be comparing yourself to the ex. The dream is trying to tell you not to make the same relationship mistakes that ended that relationship.<br>  <br>  To dream that you or someone is yelling, represents repressed anger that need to be expressed. If you are yelling and no one hears, then it suggests that you are being ignored.

The Five Factor Model is not a test, per se, but rather a framework for understanding personality.  The NEO-PI-R is the tool for measuring those five factors in individuals.|`|PwqwgQykaa	The FFM is the most accepted model in empirical research, and the NEO PI-R is, as the previous poster mentioned, based on this taxonomy (for articles confirming this, you can look up the authors of this test, Costa and McCrae).  The Five Factors in question can be respresented by different facets, which has been the basis for developing other tests as better predictors or representations of this model.  There are other personality inventories that are also based on the same FFM (i.e. Hogan, Goldberg, TSD in the USAF just to name a few) that may not be as extensively validated.<br>  <br>  The FFM is a theory, while the NEO PI-R is a test, and its research looks into assessing construct and content validity of the other.

c6eae266bb501e0a315d4b3e606f9c99aa	Judiciary Independence is the doctrine which states that the Court System should be separate and independent from other branches of government.  It is important as one of the checks and balances within a government which prevents one branch from becoming too powerful.  So, for example, in the U.S., a president can be brought before the Court.  If the Court was not independent, a president might be able to refuse to follow the laws of the land or to refuse to abide by Court rulings.  As well, the Court System is meant to be independent from the Legislative branch of government.  That way, those that enforce and interpret laws are not the same folks who are making the laws.  Again, keeping the Courts independent from law-making allows them autonomy and credibility.
c6eae266bb501e0a315d4b3e606f9c99aa	Identity is your sense of self as a person.  We begin to develop this sense of self from the time we are born.  Obviously, as we grow up, physical characteristics play a role, but probably more important is how we are nurtured and cared for as children.  Parents have a huge role to play in children's developing identity.  As we get older we often tie our identity to an occupation or an avocation.  We think of ourselves as a psychologist or a musician or a gardener.  The physical self continues to play a role.  We think ourselves as attractive,or fat, or athletic.  Ultimately, identity involves all of these factors as well as a kind of intangible sense of ourselves - the emotional / spiritual / psychological selves that cannot be seen.  As you can see, identity is a multifaceted complicated construct.|`|hlvdPjeFaa	i guess your identity is brought about by factors like: how you were raised, your background, the people around you, genes. once someone has figured out their identity, life would be a rather fun journey. i've yet to figure mine out!|`|R0TBobyGaa	I like this question<br>  <br>  I think a lot of people including myself struggle at times to find a sense of identity. While others find or form their identity quickly.<br>  <br>  The majority of your identity is formed from adolescence to your mid 20's just based on how you were raised...You develop most of your concrete values at this time. <br>  <br>  But I think there have just become such societal norms that people are constantly changing their persona's to meet the needs or certain situations ie work vs home. When we have to do this so often we lose a sense of who we are. Because very rarely are you just being yourself. <br>  <br>  But for the most part our identities can be defined in two groups the people who have big aspirations in life ie president of us, professional athlete...or the people who choose to live a normal lower-middle class life. <br>  <br>  It such a broad topic its hard to explain my views on how one finds their identity.

But I'm answering because that music stuff is pretty much a non-factor, and because I disagree completely with Red's answer (which somehow had a +5, -1 rating when I saw it). Something has to give them the idea of suicide in the first place, but listening to "I wanna kill myself!" all day will never convince somebody to actually do it. Bad influnce? Yes. Primary cause of teen suicide? No. For Red: There isn't a need for that elitist attitude. I don't like creeps in society, especially if they might become a threat to me, but the fact is that suicide is 100% preventable, and these people just need psychological counseling. There's not any problem too grave that they can't escape from, and there are always people to help and better ways to cope than suicide. Problem is, these people don't know it because of a lack of education, friends giving bad advice, or bad support from family. If they were talked to by a professional, then no matter how sad they are, they can become more stable. Having an attitude like this does little to solve the problem and prevent it in the future. Instead of growing up to be killers, if these people were saved, they could invent the next great technological device or give to society in some other way and not take from it as you assume.|`|hlvdPjeFaa	they're unable to control the pressure they receive from school and their daily lives. simple as that.|`|AdIrjmV7aa	Teens go through extreme changes in their lives both physically and emotionally.

I hope this helps|`|Hf94X5Wvaa	Why? Because they're whiney b*tchy little idiots. They think their life is so full of pain and suffering, and frankly, it's good they kill themselves.

I can almost bet that most of these teens are not close to tier parents.And have a hard time talking of issues. I am a white. I grew up in a black environment and a a very poor neighborhood. ( no punt intended I am not racist.)  I watched my brother get thrown in a dog pen, and threw a snake on him and bit him in the leg. I was stuffed in a trash can and rolled me down a ally because I would not try pot.We ran home from school everyday and always in fights.Till one day we were able to go live with are father.My brother and I are still here.I think it has to do more with being lonely. Maybe the lack of coping with other.

7136c946cbc63e37f14db5cd8da4ccd6aa	hey your feelings are natural, at some level psychologically, you obviously see the car as your connection to your father. and having to scrap it makes you feel that you are trying to get rid of his belongings or any sign of him. But you have got to change your outlook of it.<br>  <br>  let me tell you something....<br>  <br>  look in the mirror - what do you see?????? hmm ? you ?<br>  <br>  your father lives on as you - you are from him so he lives in YOU. when you first came into this world, he held you, he kissed your forehead, when you cried at night, he comforted you, held you close, told you "daddy is here", when were a toddler and hobbling trying to stand up, he held your hand, he taught you so much, gave you so much - he lives on in you dear girl, not in the piece of metal that he drove around in.<br>  <br>  YOU - his child - his baby must have meant soooo much more to him than his car or anything else. so if you want to continue his legacy, make sure you live your life to the full, you enjoy and smile and be happy - because somewhere he is watching and nothing will give him more peace than you being happy|`|GJqyVNFqaa	I agree with the people that said take a photo and a little bit of the car and keep them as reminders.<br>  <br>  If your dad was still around I'm sure he wouldn't want to see you driving an old unsafe bomb. I bet he didn't love the car all that much either.<br>  <br>  Sorry for your loss.|`|145c8348c6805dffd8ad539dedd6effbaa	If you can store it, do so.  If not, you need to make a clean break and finally say goodbye to your father.|`|FLgDn3OTaa	I'm so sorry to hear about your dad. I can understand why you must feel bad, but if it doesn't work then it's not going to do much except take up space. Why not keep a part of it that's in relatively good condition (the steering wheel or something) and whenever you think of him or feel like crying you will have something else to remember him by. That way, you can do both at once. There is absolutely nothing bad about wanting to get rid of it- you've done nothing wrong. I'm sure he would be thrilled to know that you loved him so much that you didn't want to get rid of it, even if you did in the end, you love him and nothing can ever change that, whatever you do. I'm sure he would be very happy to know that you'd got yourself a new car, and kept his for so long because you miss him.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|VG2X9Ihkaa	First of all, it doesn't sound stupid.  The car has lots of memories attach to it.  Keep the car for now until you are ready to let the car go.  I have helped my wife with things and situations she was not able to deal with.<br>  <br>  You are not destroying anything of your dad.  My father in law recently passed away and my wife and I are not able to let go.  I have notes, websites, his medications and all details to do with his liver cancer.  I believe when I am ready, I will be able to delete the files of my laptops.<br>  <br>  Some times you need time to deal with your feelings and emotions before you are able to let go of memory.  It might be a good idea, if you can seek some help like counselling.  You would be surprise how you will be able to deal with it and let go and still keeping your memories fresh in your mind.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|2rcCbf88aa	what would your lovely dad have said? Prob "don't be daft" get rid of  the thing! take a photo and have good memories it's only going to get older and rust, try and see it as a car and not your dad's I'm sure he wouldn't want you to be unhappy with it easy for me to say I know god bless you. be happy|`|dqDmJ9NSaa	try to sell it for spares and repairs and that way bits of the car will still be about but on other peoples cars, that's if you don't want it to be crushed. i am very sorry for you loss and couldn't even start to understand what you have been and going thro. i do understand not having a dad around tho cos my dad died when i was 15 of a sudden heart attack and i took it very hard. it must be horrendous having someone take you dad for nothing like that.  you sound like a very strong person, what about taking something from the car before it goes, maybe something that reminds you of you dad? even keep the number plate or something like that, im not sure if you are allowed you would have to ask who ever gets the car? or even if the car has a car jack or something like that you could maybe keep cos your dad may have used it to change the tyres on the car? i hope you get what im trying to say cos i sometime have trouble putting into words what i mean,  i wish you all the very best and stay strong and positive and always remember your dad lives on in your heart. x|`|kqQg7l7Caa	May I start off by saying my condolences, although you menhappenedthis happend 5 years back, it cannot be easy. <br>  <br>  Ok, first and foremost the memories will never fade, what I suggest would be a nice idea is to keep a momento, like maybe the registration plate, or the driver seat, this may sound silly but at least you know that this was his exact seat. You should keep little things from the car that remind you of your dad. Take a few pictures maybe. Once you have done this maybe you should take the remainding parts to a scrap yard but ultimatley you have the key parts of the car that you will never forget. This may not reslove how you feel emotionally but maybe it will be the start of the healing process. Take care.|`|CwNMq7RTaa	Either get rid of it and go through the grieving or keep it and just don't use it.  You're sad because you're giving away your last piece of your father.  It's not unexpected.
KeClkg2xaa	Be careful.<br>  Psychiatrists admit:<br>  - they have no idea how human mind works<br>  - they have no idea what is causing mental illnesses<br>  - they have no cures<br>  <br>  All what a psychiatrist can do for you is prescribing you with drugs that are likely to drive you crazy.<br>  <br>  It is fine if you don't believe me but you can hear it from psychiatrists (even a professor of psychiatry) and psychologists themselves in this document<br>  <a href="http://www.cchr.org/#/videos/making-a-killing-introduction" rel="nofollow">http://www.cchr.org/#/videos/making-a-ki...</a>|`|7Qy385Gtaa	Psychiatrist is a doctor from medical viewpoint and can give you pills, electroshock or brain surgery which are the only methods psychiatry uses. Brain surgeries like prefrontal lobotomy found its place in horror movies where it belongs and is disappearing from psychiatry. Electroshocks are still being given to the people despite no results and serious damage caused to the patients. Modern psychiatry focuses on drugs. Psychiatrists prescribed LSD and ecstasy as medicine in the past and their modern drugs are said to be even more dangerous. Some psychiatrists however may be using alternative methods or psychology but that is not psychiatry. Psychiatry has been using 1) brain surgeries 2) shocks (not only electroshocks but also insulin shocks) 3) drugs. <br>  I wouldn’t play with psychiatry at all - see the vids below.<br>  <br>  A must see new document - story told by psychiatrists, psychologists and other professionals - it CAN save your life<br>  <a href="http://www.cchr.org/#/videos/making-a-killing-introduction" rel="nofollow">http://www.cchr.org/#/videos/making-a-ki...</a><br>  <br>  Alternatively<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPUHUpfDVgY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPUHUpfDV...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHu7Ik36128" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHu7Ik361...</a><br>  <br>  school <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABmVOS0s" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAeABmVOS...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSZ9YTnSkLc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSZ9YTnSk...</a>
vEj7xoBraa	when a woman tells you to be honest don't be because it's a trap. Women often say they want our help they change their minds because they love seeing men suffer.|`|8ldA7Z3Baa	Every single girl or woman I've dated has been the exact same way. I figure it's there way of trying to control the arguement you may be having in order to protect their feelings from being wrong. Some men do this, but definitely not nearly as often as women.<br>  <br>  Like for example, you both had a misunderstanding about something, she points her finger and blames you, but you learn that she was actually 100% in the wrong, and she knows it yet in order to make sure she doesn't feel bad by you feeling you are right, she immediately digs up something that happened a long time ago that somewhat relates to the current debate, and recreates a different story of what actually happened in the past to confuse you. Now you've forgotten what you were going to say to prove her in the wrong, and her feelings are protected while you feel guilty about something you shouldn't feel guilty about. And now she can control you by using your guilt against you.<br>  <br>  My defense against this is to anticipate that she will jump to 'digging up the past' mode when I've just discovered that she is actually in the wrong. As soon as she jumps to the past, I immidiately say to her, "thats cool that your bringing up the past, but lets stay on topic, it's more logical to take care of problems one problem at a time", and proceed to finish my argument. It works every single time but you have to be firm about it. It so less stressful to have to argue about a current topic, and then think about a past topic that was already solved before anyway, and still keep your thoughts in order, and they know that which is why they do it. So simply, don't fall for it. Stay on topic, solve problems logically.|`|9gMQAWBNaa	Women have very long memories for emotionally charged situations.

XIbct4fuaa	They just want a virgin cause they are lousy in bed and they dont want her to know any better.|`|00yHUtXuaa	It's pretty hypocritical for a man to expect his wife to be a virgin when he is not. But that doesn't mean there is no virtue in virginity. After all, it indicates that a woman is not willing to risk pregnancy (and therefore the likely poor upbringing of a child due to single motherhood) for a few fleeting moments of physical pleasure. Of course, they same concept extends to men as well. Our society has become far to careless with reproduction. 40% of all children are now born out of wedlock and we have over 1,000,000 children killed each year in the womb as a result.|`|P1VXjLPOaa	I agree Layla. At one time, women taught their children values and morals. American society depended more on women then men to teach and develop a strong moral compass in their children. Virginity, like several other virtues are no longer valued. It's a shame. In regards to your question. I have never encountered a man who related a woman's virginity to his self-esteem. Is it possible, sure! Is it probable, not likely.|`|9d3779e08741de60c8b3afd027f91e1eaa	Not as a cause, although some men with low self esteem may define a woman's value by her virginity.<br>  <br>  I think it's more that (some) men are born stupid and need to learn things over their lives.  It's not so easy for a man.  They're basically born gorillas ingrained with self survival manners in their genes.  Only when you love, nurture and teach young men do they grow up to be adults.  That's why you still find a lot of crackheads that are full grown but so bloody boorish at age 30+ when they should be men.|`|ceac5e1af44045f0a37db88050efe019aa	It depends on the man.

It's a pretty dated concept with more religious connotations than actual reasons.|`|YQOT68xFaa	Sometimes yes, absolutely. And judging someone's value by their life choices is silly all the time - people have value, whether they live right or not.<br>  <br>   But think about it...if a person's had thirty partners, don't you think it is a fair assessment to say he or she isn't all that pure sexually, or that perhaps he or she is a tad lacking in the morals department?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ADD<br>  Personally I think people should wait until marriage, and ideally only ever be with their spouse. But I know that most people don't live that way. Anyways, there is a difference between someone who's only had a few partners and someone who has had a whole bunch, you know? That's why I used the number 30 - that's kind of a lot of partners, when you think about it.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	I think so.  It's one thing to want a woman who's a virgin, because you're a virgin also; it's another thing to assume terrible things about her because she had premarital sex.  Like I've said before, being a virgin doesn't stop you from being a murderer, a liar, a cheater, a backstabber, etc.  It just means that you're not having sex.|`|GqTSa85daa	I don't know, It was never really important to me whether a girl was a virgin or not.

iUzSlmSbaa	You should definitely go to your family physician.. tell him or her about this problem, in hope that your doctor will be able to get you in touch with the right kind of councellor who can help you to get control over those problems.. , I am not sure if this is ADHD... it could be any number of things.. so you should get in touch with your doctor, he should send you to a specialist who can determine the reason why you feel that way and then you can get help. The not being able to pay attention .. not able to focus for long on one thing.. could be the above mentioned but only a specialist can really tell you what the problem is and once one knows the problem, then a solution to that problem can be found and you can get the help you need to feel better because this is not trivial.. it does matter and needs to be dealt with and you need help ... one day you will go and look for a job, it would be great if by that time you have found the help and to be able to cope with those problems you have.. and have them under control..  it's not your fault.. but don't dismiss them as trivial.. xx|`|AA10510845	People tend to concentrate more on things they are interested in. Apparently, you don't find your school subjects mentally stimulating enough to put your best foot forward.  I'm wondering also, if you have ever been diagnosed with ADHD or  some other behavioral problem.  If not, I would suggest that you see a specialist in this type of disorder.  There are medications that will help you to concentrate and work better in the classroom situation.  I especially recommend this since you indicate you are also disruptive. These are clear symptoms of the behavioral disorder ADHD or Asberger's Syndrome.  Please get the help you need.  Good luck!

I was taught at a very early age that it's rude to stare at people, particularly the disabled.  I can't answer the question why they are staring at you.  Maybe you are just very attractive and they can't take their eyes off you.  Or you may just be hyper sensitive and imagine they are staring.  Sorry, hon, but that's a sign of paranoia to a mild degree.  If it makes you feel any better, most people are self-absorbed in their own problems to spend a lot of time judging or assessing anyone else.  So quit worrying about it, and try to concentrate more on enjoying your life.  Good luck!|`|noU2uKEoaa	On the basis of probability alone it's highly unlikely people are staring at you any more than they are staring at anyone else. After all, why should they?

ApELEov7aa	Dreaming does not occur by what happened that day, or what you are thinking about. When you dream, most of the time you are doing it subconsciously, so you don't control the outcome of your dreams or even the beginning of them. So, in the end it doesn't mean that you don't care about your boyfriend or girlfriend, it just means that you don't control what is going through you mind.

Women do NOT enjoy making porn movies and a closer behind-the-scenes look will show you several reasons why. <br>  In the world of hardcore sex, an average day on the set for a porn actress is a long and tedious process. Women are told to come in around 8 am for makeup but it's only to make sure porn actresses arrive on time to work. Porn stars have a nasty habit of arriving late because they're often hung over from drugs or alcohol from the night before. <br>  After make up, porn actresses usually wait around long hours until it's their turn to do their scene. Some scenes take an hour and some take several hours to film. It really depends if the male actor in the first scene could "perform" or not. It also depends if female actresses have to stop the clock because they can't handle the pain of a hardcore sex scene. <br>  While waiting around, jaded porn performers usually end up in the rest rooms with bottles of alcohol and lines of speed or outside in their cars for a heroin fix or gathered in the back yard with other actors to smoke marijuana. <br>  To add to the mind-numbing process, women are never able to experience sexual pleasure because of the continuous cutting during sex scenes. In the background the director constantly yells, "cut" and the flow of action is interrupted in order to get a better shot, adjust lighting or to wipe up bodily fluids. Repeatedly pornographers stop scenes and ask actors to "freeze" in position during very hardcore sex acts, which causes great physical and emotional pain for porn actresses. <br>  I speak from personal experience when I say to be in the middle of a hardcore sex act with several actors at the same time and told to "freeze" in position for several minutes while lighting or cameras are adjusted is extremely painful and degrading. It's also very humiliating when scenes are stopped in order to wipe up bodily fluids such as semen, feces and blood. <br>  Despite the fact women do not enjoy making porn movies, they continue to lie to their fans and proudly insist they enjoy making porn movies. Of course they do. They get paid hundreds and thousands of dollars to lie because this is their occupation. Porn stars are paid professional liars who know how to "act" and they do it well. In fact, because porn stars spend a great deal time in front of the camera and never step out of character, they usually have greater acting abilities than mainstream Hollywood actors. <br>  I used to brag endlessly to fans and pornographers about my extreme "Italian" sex drive and how I loved making porn movies. I would go on and on about how I needed more and more to fulfill my insatiable appetite. I lied 100% of the time to 100% of the people. Lying is the native language of porn stars because they can't afford to tell you the truth. Not only would it ruin the fantasy for their fans but more importantly, it would ruin the amount of their paychecks. Don't believe porn actresses when they proudly proclaim they enjoy making porn movies. They're ACTING. <br>  <br>  <br>  ad this article.....
9447d6d4627edef320b8495e7ad8a770aa	It's not easy to change from a worried state of mind to a blissful state of mind. It's better to think better feeling thoughts in steps. That said, think about this statement: Change the way you look at things and the things you look at change.<br>  <br>  Think of everything as connected and from the same source. When you do, you begin to look at others as if you are looking in the mirror. You are 100 percent responsible for the experiences you have in your life. Look to yourself when you believe that someone is making you angry. Make a change in your thoughts and feelings. Feelings are your guide that tells you when you are not in harmony with your Source. Your Source is love unconditional and eternal. Be giving and thankful and then all your wants and needs will come to you without effort.|`|vY5HUrQPaa	Yes, I can really do that now, after spending too many years in fear and worry. <br>  <br>  The ability to be happy and not worry depends on what and in whom you trust. Money, leaders, looks, family, job, physical strength, etc.- all of these can be destroyed, die, become lost or fail. <br>  <br>  This isn't about religion, but about having a relationship with God who created all, knows all, and can supply every need. This is the reason not to worry, for it means I can bring every anxiety and problem to God who will solve them and/or help me cope. And He gives peace to His obedient children that no one can completely understand. This peace will control the way I think and feel. <br>  <br>  How does the relationship start?  Ask Jesus Christ to come into your heart, to forgive you of any sin. Thank Him for dying for you so you can have eternal life. Tell Him you believe He's the Son of God who has risen from the dead, and that you'll serve Him.<br>  <br>  Then stay in contact by talking to the Lord everyday, and follow His Life Manual (the Bible) daily, starting with St. John. God's Word can change you from the inside out, change how you see and think about yourself and life. Make friends at a local Bible-teaching  church and tell others about Jesus.|`|661b6942f6dddce43fe2dcb16a5f0068aa	I also get more angry. They don't know what we're going through.

xGb2CBgkaa	Definitely.  The unprecedented expansion of credit and money supply happened during his watch.  In fact, he had a lot to do with it with his low interest rate policies.  He watched for signs of inflation in goods and services.  <br>  <br>  But he chose to look the other way when it came to asset inflation.  Ridiculous.  He saw the asset bubble building in the housing market and did not raise interest rates.  His explanation in the post-collapse period for this oversight was that he didn't expect housing to collapse the way it did because it never had in the past.  Ridiculous.<br>  <br>  Some of his own Fed Governors have been arguing with his about the dangers of credit overexpansion for years.  But he chose to be blind to it b/c he was too busy being Santa Clause.

0d183ab8af4fe4c2164d74294bd981adaa	No I do not believe abortion is wrong, and neither did the men and women of old. Women used herbs as a means of birth control, and those herbs were abortive in nature. <br>  <br>  Women have the ability of becoming pregnant each and every year, and since that is the case, more women would have had tons of children back then. They did not due to the herbs they took. Women only started being forced to become pregnant more often after men started labeling anyone who worked with herbs, as some sort of a witch. <br>  <br>  So now thanks to years and years of male doctors we do not have access to the ancient birth controls women used for years, and many of the plants are now extinct. Now where is our safe birth control? Oh thats right we are persecuted and forced to take chemicals that are harmful to our bodies if we want to prevent a pregnancy.|`|wgZVeLZPaa	I agree with you. I don't think we should judge on a case-by-case basis. People make mistakes and even with the best contraceptives things can happen. <br>  <br>  I think it's responsible to a certain extent, and like I've said before it's not like getting an abortion is a decision people just make like they are choosing what shirt to wear. It is a very hard decision to make, and one that's not done lightly.|`|sfn6SpbCaa	When my husband and I had our daughter we were dirt poor; in addition to that we were raising my son from my first marriage.  We didn't whine or carry on about how we had no money; we did something about it. Truthfully in this particular case he never complained he shouldered his responsibility, as he believed his responsibility is and proved himself worthy of a better position. What I'm saying is no one threw in the towel and gave up without at least trying.

The damage it does to your body on the inside is wow bad!  <br>  but a lot of people state they should give the child up for adoption... i have met a few people from homes... and over half of them have a crappy quality of life!  some even end their own life! <br>    <br>  i must state i don't think abortions should be used as birth control! <br>  <br>  but as for someone i know who had a few abortions she works with kids and to make a long story short as possible the kids if they see her preggo she will go out of business as they will fear that she will not come back after having a kid... now i know there is more to this  than what i even know but why should her mate suffer by not getting laid because of how some proactive human wants to pry their nose into someone elses business!  and say bad things about my friend! <br>  <br>  so frankly i'm pro minding your own business... and people who truely side with highly conversational topics like this have way to much free time and most likely need to focus on themselves a  bit more! <br>  <br>  it's okay not to want to "kill babies" just don't push your views on to other peoples!  that's just stupid! <br>  <br>  again i'm not for or againsted it but i wouldn't never do it!|`|FL67UPPHaa	If you know you can't support a child, then you should be responsible and make sure you don't create one. It's too late to make that decision once you're already pregnant -- as a man, you have to decide if you want a child before you have sex, so why aren't women capable of doing that too?<br>  <br>  It's quite funny when people use nature as their excuse for not being able to control themselves. Humans aren't simply animals, we can all make sensible choices. Lots of people choose to wait for sex.<br>  <br>  There's never an ideal time to have a child, especially financially. But you just have to make the best of it. You may have to cut back a little, but in Western society there is so much financial help available and no one lives in absolute poverty. If you really can't raise the child, you can put it up for adoption. I'm sure all the adopted children in the world are glad they're alive.<br>  <br>  Since abortion is legal, then of course women who have abortions aren't put on trial for murder. But legality doesn't prove morality, and since an unborn baby is genetically and biologically human then murder is the correct term for deliberately ending its life.<br>  <br>  I really don't know why pro-choicers care so much about our beliefs anyway... abortion is legal, no one's stopping you from having one. But that doesn't mean everyone has to agree with it.|`|yWi0gWiBaa	If someone who gets pregnant in the first place has "morals"  then there is something wrong with them.  abortion is wrong because you should not kill a living thing.  yeah it may just be an embryo and blah blah blah but it's growing into a living human being that breaths and has a heartbeat and everything.  abortion is basically murder whether you want to believe it or not.  and do NOT tell people to "stop with this "i think it's murder!" crap" when you ask the question....why do you believe abortion is wrong....IT'S AN OPINION!|`|84gK4XlHaa	I think that we all know people whose parents weren't equip to be parents or who grew up as foster kids or were adopted.  Some of them may even be your good friends or partner.  Ask them how moral it is to kill a child simply because you're not prepared to deal with the consequences of your actions.

Some of these include being stupid, inferior, seed-planting, house cleaner, not career oriented, not a decision maker.

Thankfully, a woman like Michelle Obama is in the White House today, and just as RuPaul says " The era of the bimbo is over."

I've heard people claiming women are better at everything from organisation through to empathy to sport...... the list is almost endless.<br>  The fact is though when people say wither men or women are better at something they are usually highlighting something they, themselves, are good or bad at and attributing that flaw/ability to their gender.<br>  There ARE certain areas which each gender typically excels as both men and women use differing parts of the brain in differing quantities (although the reasons for this are still unclear - it could be social conditioning learned from an early age rather than strictly gender based for example) but it is impossible to identify anything as a gender specific strength.|`|RA7WIdNIaa	Vagina and ironing, not much more.|`|aKBqMLuhaa	just checking out the answers....

Theres reasons for these, and from what I've seen and thought about its less about being brought up that way and more the gender of the brain, as I have seen females who have claimed themselves to have male brains, who excel in physics/maths/IT areas (areas the male brain ussually is better at) but hopeless at languages, and vice versa with men. <br>  <br>  Also when measuring who is more successful, men are more successful...if you are using men's standereds, which often seem like a waste of time.

Dreams are a natural occurrence when you're in turmoil over something as big as a breakup. <br>  In my opinion, your description of your dreams implies that you very much want to please your ex, but have strong feelings about equality too. That's why you're angry with him and hide after he yells at you in the mall. By no rights should anyone be yelling at you for something so trivial.<br>  Your dreams also indicate that you feel that he can be overly controlling, and doesn't take your own personal insight very seriously.<br>  Even though on the game show you were getting the answers wrong, you were still expressing your opinion. He didn't like that, and was mad at you again. In the mall he was mad at you for wanting to do something he himself hadn't suggested.<br>  <br>  Whether or not your ex actually behaves this way is up to you, but in any case it sounds like you're torn between wanting to make him happy and being treated fairly... or at least having more freedom.

You are feeling overwhelmed and out of control in some situation in your waking life. This may reflect the way you feel in your relationship or in your work environment. You have lost your foothold and can not hang on or keep up with the hustle and bustle of daily life. When you fall, there is nothing that you can hold on to. You more or less are forced toward this downward motion without any control. This lost of control may parallel a waking situation in your life.<br>  <br>  Falling dreams also often reflect a sense of failure or inferiority in some circumstance or situation. It may be the fear of failing in your job/school, loss of status, or failure in love. You feel shameful and lack a sense of pride. You are unable to keep up with the status quo or that you don't measure up.<br>  <br>  According to Freudian theory, dreams of falling indicate that you are contemplating giving into a sexual urge or impulse. You maybe lacking indiscretion.<br>  <br>  Falling dreams typically occur during the first stage of sleep. Dreams in this stage are often accompanied by muscle spasms of the arms, legs, and the whole body. These sudden contractions, also known as myclonic jerks. Sometimes when we have these falling dreams, we feel our whole body jerk or twitch and we awaken from this jerk. It is thought that this jerking action is part of an arousal mechanism that allows the sleeper to awaken and become quickly alert and responsive to possible threats in the environment.<br>  <br>  According to biblical interpretations, dreams about falling have a negative overtone and suggest that man is acting and walking according to his own way of thinking and not those of the Lord.|`|jRrFIkTWaa	<a href="HTTP://WWW.STYLISHDUDES.COM" rel="nofollow">HTTP://WWW.STYLISHDUDES.COM</a><br>  We are wholesaler of Nike Jordan and Other Shoes in China.

Don't feel you could've done better- its amazing that you are able to face your fears in the first place. Most people would've just hid away but you didn't.

PDY2F7PBaa	Everybody in history has been colonized at some time or another by someone.<br>  Before Medieval Times---<br>  Ireland was a colony of the early Vikings, and later the Romans, and then other Anglo groups. <br>  England was a colony of Rome.<br>  Italy was a colony of  the North African Moors, China, and later Vikings and Germanic people as well.<br>  France was a colonized by the Moors, and the Basques and the Vikings.Russia was colonized by many groups of Asian people, and later Western Europeans.<br>  Do you think any of these European countries would have had any form of civilization had they not had the outside influences of the Chinese, and the Moors?  <br>  It's just food for thought. Everyone was somebody's colony at some time. Even Egypt and Saudi Arabia were Ethiopia's colony, starting out. Then things just mellowed out.<br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  To Vinyl mesh. Clearly you have a neurological problem.<br>  Colonies do not have to be connected to a landmass in order to be run by a particular group. France had colonies on North America, Africa, and Asia. Last time I checked, France was rather far away from North America. <br>  Colonies are a means of acquiring resources, making money, and making more offspring by procreating with native local women. And Italy was a colony of China, as well as the Moors. Ireland was a colony as well. In particular it was used as a human resource for slave labor in Africa and parts of Asia. Every part of Europe was at one time a colony of Asia or Africa. It's  just history, don't be so uppity. <br>  I'm from Holland, and know that parts of Northern Europe were colonized by various dark skinned, Africans who spoke Semetic languages  thousands of years  ago. That's how I have 1% African  dna, and most people in my town average around 0.0001%. That was back when most of Northern Europe was mostly albino, then mixing occured and made light hair and light eyes  just as viable as brown hair and brown eyes. Some mixing had to occur to get from the albino state to the successful phenotype we have today.|`|AA10505866	If you're asking whether or not modern technology could have been brought to Africa if Europeans had never invaded the continent, took it over by force, sold off some of the population to the Pan-Atlantic slave trade, set up their own governments, and then only left when they were finally forced to, then yes, I think that could have happened. I think that ideas and technology can travel just fine without being led by the barrel of a gun. Colonization did not have to happen.<br>  <br>  Honestly, do people really think that the Native Americans wouldn't comprehend the value of automobiles, or antibiotics, or washing machines if they hadn't been almost wiped out? I think that if the U.S. Government had not hunted them down and sent them to live on reservations, they'd still probably appreciate the television.|`|5PBRR4NVaa	I think it could have.  <br>  <br>  I think you cannot underestimate the pyramids.

Many parts of Africa were in fairly decent contact with people from the levant and arabian peninsula for thousands of years.  trading paths were well worn to be sure.  Africa also contained several very sophisticated civilizations, the libyans, egyptians,ethiopians, and many others, timbuktu was a massive sophisticated city when there were few on the globe.  Without colonization I could see all of this blooming in a totally different way, parallel to the Northern Hemisphere but every bit as vital.  Trade routes are the key, errant tribes who didnt want to consolidate into modern nationstates would be subdued with time and civilization could have become more like the civilizations of the West and far East.  <br>  <br>  Who knows though|`|HltEZkvQaa	@marsha.<br>  <br>  The romans came BEFORE the Vikings!<br>  <br>  By a good few hundred years! <br>  <br>  also, Ireland was never a part of Rome.<br>  <br>  and there's no fcuking way that Italy was a part of China!<br>  <br>  :shock:<br>  <br>  EDIT- <br>  <br>  China never had any colonies in rome, they didn't know much about europe, their maps only went as far as arabia and down the east coast of africa. <br>  <br>  The romans never colonised ireland.<br>  <br>  The vikings came centuries after the romans, Not before as you stated (this is pretty basic stuff, i don't consider myself knowledgeable in history).<br>  <br>  In order for a settlement to be called a colony it must be controlled my the mother state.<br>  <br>  Europeans were all albinos really?

AA10952386	I used to be shy - didn't really open up to people, didn't really talk to people unless I was spoken to - and this was/is deemed a very weak trait. <br>  I personally don't consider shy people inferior, but oftentimes those who are shy are not seen as the types who will be aggressive in life, in general. Shy people tend not to defend themselves in certain situations (I have several friends who are shy and they are taken advantage of because they are not confident).<br>  While shyness isn't a problem and it can be very respectable because the person has their own character and doesn't need to be loud and boisterous, when you're out there in the real world, it helps to be a little outgoing and outspoken.

I hate it when people dont really listen and they just say "oh that sucks"....your feelings probably run very deep and when you are sad and depressed it its hard. maybe one reason people arent able to listen real well to you is the anxiety....its hard to be around people in social settings for you so it might be hard to open up to people and really talk to them....you are probably a secretive person...<br>  <br>  if it helps i really i have been there. or still am. i have General Anxiety Disorder and depression. and i do take antidepressants and some other medicine for headaches i get everyday. but screw the family and friends and go talk to a shrink. (along with a gyn for your baby). talking to a doctor who will listen may help. not sure about medicine with being preggo though. <br>  <br>  disconnect you phone and lose all contact with the ex. hes given you enough problems and probably has helped lower your self esteem. which is why you feel bad and want to disappear. your friends might be confused by how to act around you. they dont want to deal with your drama or yea they just dont care. <br>  <br>  i agree with the whole "But of course, I have no one. I always end up without anyone. And when I finally feel that I have found someone that will just listen to me, I end up losing them anyway." thing because it always happens to me too. i have trust issues so i dont open up to anyone and then i have no one to talk to and then im in this stage of depression right now. and you keep thinking no one understands or ever ill and nothing they do can help. <br>  <br>  but dont give up on everything. you'll have a baby. and then life will go on.|`|UDV2UP7Waa	It's funny that you bring something like this up.

QUITE FRANKLY UR BEING A LITTLE SELFISH, because your preg. its not about you anymore its about the baby. soooo when ur upset or dont want to eat think about what you could be doing to hurt your baby. seriously, then that WILL BE ANOTHER PROBLEM. u feel me? so dont add to them...if u read, u should read a book called," The Complete Idiots Guide to the LAW OF ATTRACTION." this book will help you find ways to get past what it is you see or "think" u see and look for better outlooks in life. and u should get counseling because your hormones are probably driving you wild...chill out. things are never as bad as they seem. i have a family member who lost her mom WHILE she was pregnant and her house and only ate once a day for MONTHS...so yeah, be thankful you have a ruff over your head...u can hit me up if u wanna talk sometime. peace
AA10510845	Well, the best way I know of to make the comparison is to say that infatuation is temporary; whereas true love is permanent.  Infatuation is like a crush or "puppy love".  It eventually wears off, while love continues to grow deeper with time.  The person who is infatuated gets all starry-eyed when thinking of the object of her crush.  He or she will put their best foot forward and do everything they can to impress that person.  The one in love will love unconditionally, even when the person is ill, sweaty, cranky, or obnoxious.  This is the kind of love that lasts throughout the years, is much deeper than mere infatuation or sexual attraction. It's building a life together with a family, having the same goals and ideals.  So I think it's pretty much up to you to decide what kind of feeling you have for this person.  Do you simply daydream about him or her, and have recriminations because he or she is with someone else,  or would you make any sacrifice, no matter how great, for that person?  That will indicate your answer.  Good luck!|`|2Wysnyquaa	dont be in love with someone thats in a relationship,youll be labeled a homewrecker|`|acf19784c47b1f7b60623f6016329936aa	infactuation is when you want to know evrything about a person love is when you already do and become in love with them|`|CqqH12I8aa	infatuation is love, just on a lesser level, i thought.
45d774f93cd8fa9f498a7d7487bd0caaaa	Loneliness may be beautiful, and I can go days staying sublimely alone, and a whole year without ever drinking wine or any whatsoever alcoholic beverage.<br>  <br>  Your own regrettable habit of drinking has sort of got a fierce life of its own, ever ready to grip you and benumb you more whenever you get into a bad mood.<br>  <br>  Thus, let us say that you sort of are about to become the surrendered hostage or victim to the booze.<br>  <br>  What to do? Simply stay away from the boozying bottle! Simply try and do some magic breathing exercises whenever you feel that urge to surrender to the booze.<br>  <br>  Simply go out for a walk, or hike or ride, out into the sun-kissed or gloomy landscape, uphills on a charming scented spring-time path, alone or together with family, or lover, friend, colleague, anybody that will love to go out together with you.<br>  <br>  Also, you might try and go out, alone or in loving company, for a night walk through the safer quarters of your own city or town.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, you might abandon yourself onto a fantastic adventure on the immense glowing shores of your own soul, on the dangerous endless ocean, or flying high through the blue heavens and beyond and yonder, where I would like to join you if you would like the idea.<br>  <br>  With a great glowing impulse from the warm throbbing vaults of your own chest you might resolutely ardently decide that a life wanting some corroboration may be deserving immensely more than just some blunt alcoholic intoxication.<br>  <br>  Thus, from now on, from this very moment on, you might decide and resolutely ardently diligently stay away from that tyrannical and poisonous booze, and while seeking your own sublime freedom you will start working at building up, or lovingly adding to, some more glowing memories for a future. Have a great laugh. Good luck.|`|YseOZhI5aa	take your time and join a club or a active group where you can surround yourself with active happy people. bad thoughts are normal, get used to replacing them with happy ones. like where your going in your future or a place youd like to visit, kids etc.|`|iTS8qJfoaa	Something that will not help is idleness and isolation.

I don't judge but possibly you should visit an alcoholics anonymous meeting in your area.  You will meet other people who will tell you how the deal with the problems of loneliness. The people there don't judge you either.  For me, I have to force myself to go out and talk to friends and relatives. Even though I haven't alcohol in a long time the problem still exists.
AA10729675	Articulated speech.  That is what separates us from the other animals.  We have words, sentences, etc... That brings forth reasoning and more communication, which we use very poorly, but which the animals do not have to that extent.  So it is speech.<br>  Otherwise, we really are not special at all.

GGIvqgPMaa	You really have to be careful about putting too much faith in people. I'm not saying you should never trust anyone, but people are people and make mistakes. I think this is something that most people have to learn the hard way. There are a lot of people in the world that seem like great people on the outside but are truly somebody completely different. The best advice I can give you is to remember whatever qualities that made you look up to that person and still try to aspire to those things, but to be your own person and not try to be entirely like anybody else.
3dT7f39maa	To dream of erotica, represents your sexual desires and your sexual appetite. Dreams of erotica are common dreams if you are approaching you wedding day. This may be due to the intensity of your sexual passion with your fiance. It also relates to the new roles that you will be taking on and the uncertainty that that may bring. If you are recovering from an injury, surgery, grief or illness, then you may also experience erotic dreams. The dream may serve to provide a dramatic reminder of your vitality and liveliness. To dream that you and your ex got back together again, suggests that something or someone in your current life that is bringing out similar feelings you felt during the relationship with your ex. The dream may be a way of alerting you to the same or similar behavior in a current relationship. What you learn from that previous relationship, may need to be applied to the present one so that you do no repeat the same mistake. Alternatively, past lovers often highlight the positive experiences you had with that person.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|t7hFh8STaa	I know that you can interpret dream in different ways.

9d3779e08741de60c8b3afd027f91e1eaa	Sounds a lot like Post Traumatic Stress disorder. I believe love is like war and it affects your same brain cycles.  Sometimes when you love someone a lot it can put stress on just the right parts of the brain and your brain comes to expect it, even if its not normal.  If it is PTS-like, then time and therapy can heal you.|`|YM3jlriXaa	emm hiya x<br>  <br>  like you proberley still fancey him x<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  xxxx<br>  xxxx<br>  xxxx<br>  xxxx|`|YonedWiEaa	your dream suggests that your new bf is much like your ex, or at least he is brainwashing you like your ex did, and you can not see it.  but in your heart you know that you are falling for the same type of person as your ex....|`|AA11707529	you are having these dreams, because deep down, you wonder if you have the right to be happy. He was obviously a troubled control-freak, and you're  better off without him. So your answer is yes -- you deserve to be happy with your fiancee whom you love. <br>  <br>  Next time you fall asleep, tell yourself aloud "I love my fiancee". Then if you have the dream again, you'll have the power to tell him to buzz off.
1TPGdaXJaa	Growing up, I was this way too around people outside of my small, immediate group of close friends. Here are things that helped me:<br>  <br>  - I moved to a new place, entirely on my own. This was a true test, because I was forced to learn how to interact with people, and just talk to people to get things done. It took many years to "come out of my shell", and was very trying, especially during the first year or two on my own. But, after moving to many new places, and being in various settings (geographically), this ultimatley helped build the self confidence I needed. Also, there is something about going to a brand new place where you don't know anyone. I grew up in a relatively small-medium sized town, and in that setting many people your age (people you went to school with, etc.) knew you or had an opinion about you. Moving away somewhere completely new, where you don't really know anyone, gives you a "fresh start" to completely reinvent yourself. <br>  <br>  - In my early 20's, I finally raised the issue about the anxiety I experienced socially to my Doctor. We discussed some options, and I was prescribed generic Xanax. For me, this medicine was a near life-changing experience. I only used it as needed, when I knew I would be in social situations that would make me extremely uncomfortable. Taking the pill would remove all of the anxiety, and allow me to feel "normal" in these situations. And, after being in a situation under the influence of Xanax a couple of times, I realized I could eventually go into a similiar situation without the pill, and feel minimal anxiety. For me, the pill kind of "showed me the way" to not feel anxiety in situations.|`|TIDqJgdSaa	hmm.. its is a hard situation.<br>  go out more dont be alone a lot when your alone ALL THE TIME you will get use to it.<br>  Why dont you look at your self in a mirror ( a long mirror) so you can see your whole self..<br>  go up close to it<br>  and look AT IT and stare at it...until you can comfortable.

9EVcTnUWaa	Ok for me I would make a list of things that I"m good at, those are your stenghts.<br>    <br>  My page would look like this.<br>  <br>  Strengths<br>  <br>  I work well with Children<br>  I know how to help parents get services for their kids with learning disabilites.<br>  I know how to access information that I need.<br>  I have the ability to advocate for my self and people with psychiatric problems.<br>  I have a good relationship with my daughters especially the youngest and her friends.<br>  I have the ability to know what teens need and am able to give it to them, I'm  a Good Girl Scout leader, tutor and mentor.<br>  <br>  Weaknesses<br>  <br>  I can be impatinet with adults<br>  I hate being wrong and can be belligerent<br>  I have to be careful not to be an intellectual snob.<br>  I have to remember to be civil to those who annoy me.<br>  <br>  My accomplishments would be:<br>  I've raised three girls in a disadvantaged area but two of them through school and made sure that they both graduated high school and the middle one college.<br>  I've made sure that all of my children understand the need for school and that my older two are able to take care of themselves even the one who is developmental delays.<br>  I was able to get the correct educational setting for my youngest daughter with learning disabilites.  It's easy with people like my older daughter who's developmentally delayed. Than with my younger daughter who has more subtle disabilites like dyslexia, fine motor skills issues and other problems.  <br>  None of my girls has gotten pregnant before they wanted to, I've been able to help other teens to understand that getting pregnant puts more pressure on them rather than enhance their lives. <br>  <br>  My relationship with my extended family is basically good.<br>  I have good relationships with all of my siblings and my two older children.<br>  I'm very close to my youngest and I have a pretty good relationship with my parents.<br>  <br>  Once you put down in writing these types of things it will help you to realize that not all of your life is bad and that there is a lot of good going on also.  Once you see the areas that you're proud of as well as those you might want to work on it will help you to focus where you want to work in therapy.|`|AA11424994	These are all good answers, but since you did not understand her you need to ask your therapist exactly what she meant by building up your strength... and ask her for examples.

But when I sit and think about it, I have a lot of accomplishments, and so do you.<br>  <br>  Do not make the mistake of thinking that all of your accomplishments are "little," or meaningless.  That is the low self esteem secretly controlling your thoughts.<br>  <br>  Make a list of things you have accomplished. It could be passing a test or helping two friends work out an argument. <br>  <br>  You don't have to be cocky - but give yourself some credit. God doesn't make trash.|`|BmP4o2IPaa	Your therapist is trying to reinforce your strongest positive attributes (maybe you're friendly, hard working, tenacious, musician, volunteer etc.) and de-emphasize your weaknesses.<br>  Basically she wants you to be an optimist, and she wants you to become stronger where you're strong to counter the areas where you're weak.|`|MuQ72xobaa	Your strenghts, e.g. your sence of humour, a good listener.

When I think of feminism the term 'pester power' often comes to mind.

However it has emotional appeal because most men don't want to say no to women, especially when they pitch it as an 'equality issue' - and what guy is against equality?|`|OyEEyIpdaa	No they remind me of communists in America who just want to subvert the whole system without recognizing costs and weighing benefits.

The physical beauty is a mans' choice that may complicate the need further and cause him undue problems but that part is his choice.|`|8722a385a740fd3c165b65c08ed568ffaa	Well, men don't really "love" women--we're just easy to use.<br>  The idea about us being their "weakness" is just a way to excuse men, like "I couldn't help beating her 'cause she didn't look at me the right way" or "I couldn't help cheaitng on her 'cause she didn't comb her hair that day."  Like we have all these powers over them so its not thier fault when they act like retards.|`|fDGPbwdsaa	Most men will change their actions if a woman dear to them requests / demands it.<br>  <br>  Beauty has little to do with it - rather their love.<br>  <br>  Conversely, most women will not change their actions for a man dear to them.|`|vEj7xoBraa	men have no weaknesses.|`|AA10818712	"Well, men don't really "love" women--we're just easy to use."<br>  LOL Speak for yourself...|`|BGNdKvXzaa	Man's primary weakness is greed, his thirst for money, not any quest for knowledge or success.

Don't bottle it up and remember that depression DOES pass. Don't be afraid to ask for help.|`|090Uv4sKaa	Life is harsh. It's cruel, and it destroys us all in the end. The point of it is to be as brave as is humanly possible and batle through - who knows what is in the afterlife, but I reckon it's better than this.<br>  <br>  My life, like yours, is a downward spiral. So much is going wrong for me, I just feel like giving up completely. But I keep going.<br>  <br>  I see life as a test.

A lot of violence, and disrepect. I wish I would have handled it differently, I started crawling into a hole and started feeling the same way you do. My advice is to talk to someone about the problems you are having face to face, a counselor, parent, friend, etc. Don't hate your life because it's not always going to be like this, just keep reminding yourself of that Find ways to handle the anger you are having outside of your home, maybe go for a walk, use the anger as fuel to do something productive. Sitting around and thinking about it constantly without doing something to change it will not help you, I am speaking from experience. It took me years to get over the problems I had. Just keep your head up and focus on your future.

There r so many ppl who dont accept themself & arent even transvestites. Thats actually a pretty normal feeling, but still not good I guess so find a good therapist to talk to & help.

There are groups that can help you to accept you for who you are. Having a strong sense of self is very important if you are going to be different than the majority of people. You didn't mention how old you are, but sometimes age makes acceptance better. <br>  <br>  Ask yourself why you consider desire stupid and ridiculous. Ask yourself why you like women's clothes. You can seek counseling to help resolve the conflict. <br>  <br>  I am lesbian and went through the same strong conflict for quite a while. It takes time to accept that you are not going to be like everyone else and that you are not going to be accepted by everyone. It takes a strong person to stand against the flow and do what they feel in their heart is right. First you need to find out what you feel in your heart is right. Once you know that, you can proceed.|`|joWIgxZpaa	To me, the best thing to do is find a decent therapist/counsellor and work through the issues that are disturbing you.

3dT7f39maa	Dreams are very rarely random, Being chased by animals often reflects a deeply held fear of the animal doing the chasing. However, it may reveal an anxiety about something completely separate from the animal kingdom. In cases like this, it is important to think about what is chasing you and what your experiences have been with that particular animal. For example, if a relative whom you did not particularly like had a German Shepherd Dog, you may dream about being chased by the dog. This may reveal either the desire of the relative to obtain your attention and affection, or it may validate your fears and anxieties about that person. If you often use animal characterisations of people's personalities, this may be particularly telling. (He's a bear, she's a mother bear, he works like a horse, and so on.)<br>  <br>  To dream of an elevator that won't let you off at the right floor means you have let your emotions, or your situation, get out of control and must do something to stop it. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|x5KsrtqVaa	This type of thing has happened to me.<br>  I have had a repeat dream for several weeks.<br>  As soon as the dreams stopped, a week later it actually happened.|`|DlP4ZM0iaa	it could mean alot of things <a href="http://dreammoods.com/cgibin/dreamdictionarysearch." rel="nofollow">http://dreammoods.com/cgibin/dreamdictio...</a>    dreams are not random their you subconsciousness|`|YonedWiEaa	being chased by an animal usually means that you are afraid of something in your life that you can not control or get away from...the elevator suggests the same thing.    there is something in your real life that you can not control and it is bothering you...are you being stalked?......that would answer the dreams if someone was stalking you
DsEEATKSaa	You can count on about 12 years beyond high school graduation to practice independently as a licensed psychologist in most states in the USA.<br>  <br>  4 years: Undergrad<br>  <br>  2-3 years: Master's degree<br>  <br>  2-3 years: Doctoral degree (e.g., Ph.D., Psy.D.)<br>  <br>  time varies: complete your dissertation (how long this takes depends on you - some manage to complete it during the internship year, others take considerably longer)<br>  <br>  1 year: APA approved internship<br>  <br>  time varies: pass the EPPP (analogous to the "bar" for attorneys - a considerable number do not pass this exam the first time around)<br>  <br>  1-3 years: supervised post doctoral experience (requirement varies from state to state)<br>  <br>  After completing each of the above steps, you will be eligible for licensure as a psychologist in most states in the USA.<br>  <br>  A recent study reports that psychologists are among THE most poorly compensated earners among those with doctoral (e.g., Ph.D., Psy.D.) degrees.<br>  <br>  In the USA, psychologists rarely make more than 100k/ year. Though, as in any occupation, the variance is considerable, most psychologists' salaries are between $45,300 and $77,750.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you in your future vocational and educational endeavors,<br>  <br>  ~Dr. B.~|`|9EVcTnUWaa	In order to become a psychologist in the US you need to gain a PH. D in psychology. That is the highest academic degree that you can achieve in the US.  You will need your basic Bachelors degree from college plus a Master's degree and than a PH. D.<br>  Depending on the program that you enter from college, you might not have to get a masters separate from your PH. D. Since you have surpassed the master's requirement when you get your PH.D. it's felt that you don't need to waste the time getting the master's first.  I know a lot of Psychologist and I don't know what "Dr. B" or what ever her name is is talking about.  All of the psychologist that I know make over 100.000 a year.  That's not where they start of course but with at least 10 years experience they make that much.  I will tell you that most of them don't just have private practices they do something else also.  Most people can't afford private practice and insurance won't pay the whole amount of private insurance.  So most of the psychologists that I know work either in hospitals, clinics, schools or other psychotherapy settings as well as having a private practise.|`|QODJNf1oaa	Many of them start at 70,000 annually. You first have to get a bachelors degree (4 years). You can do some jobs in Psychology with a bachelors degree, but you wont be able to be a Psychologist. You have to go on to graduate school, and it will take you another two years to get your masters. Then you can become a Psychologist in most places. Some require that you have a Phd which would be another two years. I would recommend becoming a Psych. major, because even if you decide that you don't want to go on for more school - you can do basically anything with this type of degree. The classes are really interesting and they relate to real life.
s05BJFkbaa	A psychologist earns a 4 year degree in psychology.<br>  A PSYCIATRIST is a medical doctor (M.D.), so anybody who wants to become a doctor has to take the regular pre-medical set of courses. It really depends on you, on how long you are going to stay at the university. If you want to earn a bachelor's degree while taking the pre-medical set of classes, it could between 4-6 years to graduate, but if you just want to take the pre-med classes then maybe 3 years, to do this option you do not have to go to a university, but a community college ( all you have to do is talk to counselor).<br>  <br>  IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED TO GET A DEGREE JUST IN CASE YOU DON'T GET INTO MEDICAL SCHOOL.<br>  <br>  after university comes 4 years of medical school, and then 3 years of residency training in child psychiatry.<br>  <br>  another option is getting a degree in psychology and specializing in child psychology.<br>  <br>  The difference between a psychiatrist and a psychologist, is that psychiatrist can prescribe medicine. Now though, with 2 years of training a psychologist can now do the same.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  You do counsel children who have problems like concentrating in school or behaving bad in school and at home.<br>  <br>  starting out child psychiatrist make $122,000(U.S.) a year and can end up making $170,000 a year (VERY GOOD PAY)|`|ZfsgIDa0aa	Earn a lot as a general psychiatrist... about a million or 2 a year, depending on how good you are. A psychiatrist is a doctor, so you have to go through med school before you can specialise in anything. That means cutting up dead dead bodies at uni, learning all the different medications, seeing and cutting open patients as an intern doctor before you are finally registered as a doctor. THEN you can go on to specialising into psychiatry by taking the coarse and learn psychiatry. But yes, there is a lot of counselling and talking to people about there problems, but most the time it's going to be the more insane people. From the chronically depressed, bipolar, to the criminally insane, split personality people. Psychiatrists aren't really people you see when you have a "bad dream", that's a psychologist's job.

That's what girls are made of.|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	I think they can.  If the criticism goes to sexism, then it is coming from a man predisposed because he is not aware of how to make the criticism unladen with the error.<br>  <br>  Many men can criticize with no implication of sexism or bitterness.|`|aKBqMLuhaa	If he is being critical by using sexist comments or a bitter tone to his voice, a woman must call a spade a spade.<br>  This seems to work both ways. Men tend to call women feminazi's when they say anything critical of men. <br>  Its just one of the many male/female role plays.|`|8722a385a740fd3c165b65c08ed568ffaa	Probably for the same reason a woman can't criticize men without being called a b****, a cu**, ovebearing, dominant, a man hater, frigid, or just bitter.|`|vEj7xoBraa	because women can't handle the truth,and therefore they will call men sexist for that.|`|AA11707728	Because the biological imperative supports telling a woman what to do.  Women are just naturally not good at deciding for themselves the best way to do something.  Since its not something they can control, fix or change, criticism is pointless and causes them to feel bad and inadequate without allowing them an outlet for improvement.<br>  <br>  If your women are not doing what you want, whose fault is that?  Try telling them what to do, in a calm, respectful, supportive, but firm manner.  Guidance, not being overbearing is what is called for here.  Start out small and work your way up to larger things.  You might be surprised at the results.  Women WANT this from men.  But because of brainwashing from popular culture, many do not know that's what they want from their men.  That same brain washing teaches men to demand their woman be an equal partner in everything and pull her own weight with the decision making.  Yeah...that's just not realistic and it's not normal for 99% of women.  So men are constantly pissed off by all the things women do "wrong".  When in reality, they are the ones who are slacking off at the responsibilities inherit in being a man.|`|fDGPbwdsaa	This is called a typical double standard.<br>  <br>  Feminists think they have a God-given right to demonize, not just criticize, men in general - yet a man who criticized just ONE woman is a sexist, a misognyst, a this, a that, the other - and then they start ranting about castration and death.|`|3d2dbfe624a4971313c2e9183de21b00aa	i assume the same reason why a child would stomp his feet when a parent tells him to put away his socks! <br>  <br>  your being told something you didn't want to hear or do! <br>  and remember women are emotional!  so watch how it is presented and you may have a better outcome!!!<br>  <br>  for every action there is a reaction right! <br>  it's the chance we all take!|`|muHctmaGaa	To a degree, it is sexist to make specious claims against women as a group when you are responding to the conduct of individuals.|`|9679eed4decfc91fdcea2e17ae362313aa	You shouldn't be criticizing people.

Just saying...|`|QQQ36jMOaa	Criticizing A woMAN is fine.  It means your criticizing an individual for individual behavior.  However, criticizing an entire gender and generalizing them all is both ignorant and does reek of sexism.  I can easily criticize an individual man, but I would never make vast negative generalizations about the entire male gender.  There's a difference.  One must remember that women, like men, are individuals and should only be held responsible for their individual actions.  You can state that the women in YOUR life may act a certain way, but that doesn't mean ALL or even MOST women act as such.

Don't think about things, just do them. Get up and dance in front of the school. Talk really loud. When your talking and you think you're talking in a good enough volume, start talking even louder for the hell of it. Throw a paper ball at someone, anyone, randomly, up close, preferably in their face, then just run. Start going on roller coasters.<br>  <br>  Basically it's like the saying "throwing someone into the deep end". Instead of slowly testing the waters and eventually climatising to the temperature of the water, just jump in.

Don't get me wrong, every time you do these things, no matter how small, it is scary but theres a certain 'rush' or 'high' you get from doing it. I'm still afraid to do something simple like talk to girls, but when I do I get that rush.

AcgDcQG0aa	I don't think there is an optimal number.  Because people don't play games with nuclear weapons.  They do it for real.  And they won't abide by the rules of any game, when they have an opportunity to cheat or take advantage of others in some way.<br>  <br>  Perhaps the optimal number is the number that's sufficient to deter a nuclear attack from others.  But this number will vary depending on what the other competitors decide to do.
xybbsDZNaa	Proper jealousy. Sounds to me like a lady who hates her life, and therefore thinks it is okay/necessary to mock women who like their lives without the traditional marriage/babies, etc. You should let it slide, rave about your good nights out/in, and watch as her remarks get more snide the more you rave about your happiness. <br>  <br>  From a child-free household myself, i get these comments so often, "you just don't understand what it's like to be a parent", etc... no i don't, because i choose not to. And do you know what, that's okay!! <br>  <br>  Stay calm, don't let her bother you. She's only jealous.<br>  :)|`|MvC6n3DWaa	She is rude and has issues with the fact that you do not have children. She must feel she has some sort of special knowledge now that she is a mom. Low and behold. I am a mom, are you honored to be in my presence? Sorry, I could not resist! <br>  <br>  The only suggestion is you could pull her aside and tell her that you have felt some tension when issues regarding children have come into the conversation. Tell her that you respect her decision to have children and are certain that she is a great mom. However, your decision to not have children is not due to ignorance, lack of education or regard for the little ones. Tell her you would appreciate it if she could be considerate of how her statements come across as she would never intentionally hurt anyone. If that does not work, the next time she does it, burst into tears while saying "why do you always have to bring that up? Don't you know that I have no uterus?". That should put her in her place!<br>  <br>  :)|`|paerqxfMaa	She could be a little jealous - you are "fottloose and fancy free" and she is tied down with a couple of rugrats.  It happens.

KYCyj3nkaa	A Level Psych? lol. <br>  <br>  Errm when you are stressed your stress response system is activated (corticosteroids, adrenalin, noradrenalin etc are secreted).  In order for the stress response system to work effectively, your body must shut down other systems, e.g the digestive system and the IMMUNE system - this can make you more prone to illness,  (can't believe I remembered) - But to answer this kind of question you must discuss purely the evidence for and against the stress and illness link using examples of research. Explaining the stress response and immune system would be a good introduction.  You could then move on by saying:, a study to support this theory was carried out by..........<br>  <br>  Its all about positive correlations between amount of stress and illness there are so many studies which demonstrate this.<br>  <br>  Studies to search on google which might help:<br>  <br>  Holmes and Rahe's SRRS<br>  <br>  Friedman and Rosenman's Type A personality<br>  <br>  Kiecolt-Glaser - exam stress on students<br>  <br>  ...theres loads more but they are the ones i can remember.  Remember to use arguments for AND against though.|`|QFG0yu24aa	there is a lot of evidence that cortisol suppresses immune functioning by e.g. slowing the reaction of T cells and B cells to viruses. <br>  <br>  note that this occurs main with chronic (long term) stress, but short term stress e.g. dangerous sports can actually give the immune system a little boost.

Once you've done that, all you need is a push in the right direction. The first thing you have to do is break your bad habits so that you can replace them with new ones. Rehab is very good for this because you can recover under professional care in a safe, temptation-free environment. Once you've rid yourself of those bad habits, it's time to make new ones. Do you have any hobbies that you may like to pursue, such as painting, music, art, writing, anything creative? Those creative outlets will help you express your thoughts and feelings in a nondestructive way, and will give you fun things to do at the same time. Secondly, you have to make new friends who aren't as much into drinking/smoking etc. as maybe your old friends were (unless your old friends were not) and then you won't be exposed to it all the time and therefore tempted. Thirdly, if you're looking for thrills, nature is the best place to go. Camping, hiking, backpacking, snowboarding, surfing, sailing, skiing, etc. are all good things that will give you great adrenaline rushes and will be much more rewarding than drinking and smoking. Hope this helped!!!|`|RNG1cT8saa	find something that makes u feel alive but isnt illegal or hurtful - like legal street racing, skydiving, bungee jumping etc. - since there's nothing better than "feeling alive" it will be quite hard to get rid of the addiction.

It is cool that they are spreading metaphysical concepts to mass markets. But what you see is all the secret is is focusing on the positive and manifesting that . We manifest whatever we choose . But what you are choosing to manifest may not be the best thing once again .I am not trying to say that what you are doing is wrong by any means . But I am saying that congratulations on the ability to manifest and that selflessness is the greatest manifestation. bless you .

wgZVeLZPaa	I think men are emotional; they just show in different ways like aggression, anger or even masking emotions by being sarcastic and making jokes.<br>  <br>  The same goes for being sentimental. We just show our emotions and sentiments in different ways.|`|9VAnsWYUaa	Women are encouraged more to show their true emotions.|`|0d183ab8af4fe4c2164d74294bd981adaa	I think women are, because they are allowed to be and everyone expects this.|`|1HfLkTrdaa	I would say despite the stereotypes of women being more sentimental and emotional, in reality, it's the men who are.  Moreover, the men have often attempted to use that emotionality and sentimentality in order to control women!<br>  <br>  Why would I say that?  <br>  <br>  Well, I base this on my studies of literature, music, art and the humanities...and also from personal observation of 48 years on Earth lol.<br>  <br>  For many centuries, it was the MEN who wrote and controlled the publications/promulgation of the books and histories of Western Civilization, and women's works were usually and consistently suppressed and discouraged.<br>  <br>  If you read the various literary works that comprise the literary canon in most schools and universities, you find they are full of romanticism and sentimentality ...this includes books and movies as diverse as the Bible to the Crusades Era "Chanson de Roland" to "Tristan and Isolde", to Dantes "Inferno" to Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet" on down to the 1915 film "Birth of A Nation", the 1942 film "Casablanca" and even the 1997 James Cameron epic film, "Titanic".  <br>  <br>  If you ever study classical poetry, you'll find it was the men who tended to wax sentimental and romantic about male/female relationships moreso than the women.  The very flowery sentiment in the poem "Come live with me and be my love" was penned by Christopher Marlow, a male poet.  When it came to romance and sex, the women poets were considerably more realistic and even a bit more negative as evidenced in the poems, "The Disappointment" by Aphra Behn and also in the poem "On Monseur's Departure" by Queen Elizabeth I.  The so-called "Virgin Queen" was known to be quite emotionless in most of her dealings. It's ironic that she would be so because her father, King Henry VIII was a man of high passions, who wrote love poetry and songs like Greensleves to woo her mother, Anne Bolyn, but then heartlessly beheaded her because of his emotionality which was often expressed in jealousy and anger.<br>  <br>  Even in more "modern" poetry, men tended to be the 'peacocks' as it were with more verbose and flower-y works...whereas women tend to be more concise and a hit the nail on the head style when writing.  Compare Emily Dickenson to say, Walt Whitman, and you'll see what I mean.<br>  <br>  In fact, it was often the extreme sentimentality of men that lead them to channel it in destructive ways, such as the starting of wars and also in the rise of secret societies such as the Ku Klux Klan just after the Civil War.  Another reason why the 1915 movie Birth of A Nation was so extremely popular despite it's racist theme. DW Griffith was known to be a romantic and sentimentalist and he knew how to tap into those emotions to sell movies to people who despite several decades passing still were feeling the sting of defeat from the Civil War. <br>  <br>  In terms of music, most of the most romantic and sentimental of operas were written by men. Those operas played heavily on emotionality, especially when it came to sexual jealousy. A good example of that can be seen in the jealous and cuckholded clown in Ruggero Leoncavallo's Pagliacci as well as the jealous matador Don José  in Bizet's Carmen.<br>  <br>  Many of the modern "romantic" and "sentimental" pop songs that both men and women have recorded were actually written by men and marketed to women.  <br>  <br>  An example of this?  <br>  <br>  A top 10 song from 1982, the almost embarrrassingly maudlin and sentimental  "I've Never Been To Me."   It was recorded by Charlene, but originally written by two men, Ron Miller and Kenneth Hirsch. It was originally written from a man's point of view...an old sea captain advising a young man to avoid the mistakes the older man made.  The words were then re-tooled as being woman who regretted her freewheeling lifestyle and is advising a bored housewife to be thankful for what she has and voila, you've got a so-called "women's song."   <br>  <br>  I liked this song back in the day, mind you, but when I look back and think about it in a sense it's really seems a marketing insult and somewhat sexist! Consider this: what in the hell would a man really know about ANY woman and her feelings about not becoming a mother, someone who allegedly "sometimes get to crying for unborn children that might have made me complete?"  That whole the message of "if you as a woman actually go for what you want out of life, then you pay the price in loneliness and childlessness..." and we all know that's a lot of bull...but yeah, it still struck a chord/nerve with many young childbearing age women at that time. that song is a perfect example of using emotion and sentimentality to control someone else's future actions and choices. It's not much different than those 18th Century "epistolatory" novels used for that same purpose such as "Pamela" or "Virtue Rewarded" by Samuel Richardson<br>  <br>  At any rate, women (especially poor and working class women) for the most part were too busy with the day to day tasks of running a household and childbearing/parenting that they didn't really have the "luxury" of looking at their assigned tasks with any sort of romanticism or sentimentality until at least the 20th Century, when women began entering the workforce and had more discretionary income...that's when men began widely marketing the "romance novels" and the Hollywood movies to women.  <br>  <br>  Also, if you read any of the diaries of the pioneer women who traveled Westward in the US during the 19th and early 20th century prior to WWI, you find them starkly unsentimental compared to similar diaries that the pioneer men were writing at that time.|`|fk8Lz10Aaa	men hide it<br>  women show it<br>  but i think from everything ive heard women lol|`|vEj7xoBraa	you're 12 years old aren't you?|`|sN8aqb95aa	completely depends on thier attitude, and how they have been brought up.

IlSGU9Yzaa	I think mental pain is worse because wounds heal, but if you destroy the mind the whole body goes with it. Even the dirty home can be classified as mental harm because it causes great anxiety. I've had experience with being very hury by a loved one that almost caused a suicidal responds and i also had to live in a dirty home against my desires for 8 months and it drove me up the wall. A broken arm for example will hurt for a few then its  ok|`|afI03mJXaa	I would say that physical harm and being hurt would be worse because it is a physical act towards someone. That is more traumatizing then a dirty environment. Being physically harmed can effect a person mentally when it comes to a relationship, friends etc.. It can cause erratic behavior towards others as well as whether it be joining a gang, becoming sexually active at a young age, doing drugs, getting in trouble with the law or dropping out of school. All these effects are caused because of physical harm or abuse towards themselves or others that they have seen. Having a dirty environment can cause a person to have bad hygiene or be messy at home and can cause problems when it comes to a relationship being that the person their with may not want to be with someone who is dirty and messy. Good Luck|`|G4pmbc0Qaa	I would say physical and verbal abuse is worse than a dirty environment. People need security on a very basic mental level. In fact, security comes second after food water and oxygen on the scale of needs. If you're in constant danger not only physically, but you're also dealing with threats and verbal abuse, which damage self esteem, another basic need, you're going to be a worrisome, troubled individual. Cleaness is a luxury and while we're use to it (for the most part) in civilization, man can live without soap if that's all he's ever known, and live quite happily.|`|Pwh9bDdKaa	dirty environment i guess, because you can shake off what people say easily.

YzoLa5Uuaa	The MBTI is a good tool, but everyone's personality is variable and changes depending on the situation. Personality tests tend to do a really good job of highly specific but ambiguous results (sounds counter-intuitive, but make sense if you have read a lot of personality "profiles"). <br>  <br>  It is important to recognize that everyone uses thinking and feeling throughout their lives-- whether I like to admit it or not as a strong "Thinker", I do have emotions and weigh them accordingly when making decisions. The idea of T vs F is which one you use more consistently. <br>  <br>  The jobs that they list should not limit you in what you are interested in. If you like accounting, it does not matter if you are an ENFJ, and ISTP, INTJ, or any other combination. You may have more tendencies to get bored with a topic, but if you like it, no personality test should stop you. <br>  <br>  Especially since you are on the border between two, you can try and differentiate between which one you more closely identify with. But for some people they "switch" often (especially if they are within 5 points of the middle line). <br>  <br>  If you have any other questions about the MBTI, feel free to send me a message. I have read far too much information about it over the past few years.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.
