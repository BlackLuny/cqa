Neither my husband or I receive health benefits through our jobs.  We need to find affordable health insurance and can't seem to find much.  We have a family of 4 and most companies seem to be charging more than $400 per month...and that's with a high deductible.  Is it normal to be that high?  Do any of you pay for your own insurance?

Everyone knows the economic state we are in and how we can blame it on shark lenders (and also some greedy homeowners who bought out of their means).      Yes, houses have plummeted in price and value, but there is still a plethora of houses that have been sitting on the market for almost a year, and it seems that homeowners and real estate agents are still asking too high of a price for anoynoumous, nothing-looking houses in an anonymous suburb.  I even think $150,000 is way too much for a house that is less than 1,650 sq ft.      If banks are losing money by letting these houses sit, how come they just don't sell houses, for like $1,000 or maybe even less?  We'd get more buyers that way.  How come that can't be done?

My boyfriend recently filed his taxes, claiming our son, and was expecting around $4000.      Although he has been making monthly payments per an arrangement with the courts, he owes a lot in back child support for his 2 other children.  We were looking at one of his statements from the child support office, and it seemed to indicate that they will take his tax refund.      We are wondering if this is correct and if so, will they take it all?  We have been awaiting the refund - we really need it.  Of course he does want to take care of his back child support - but it doesn't seem quite right that they would take all the money when some of his refund is due to his claiming OUR son, for whose expenses we really need some of this money!      He called H&R Block, who prepared the return, and they said no, child support will not take the money.  But I don't know that I trust their response.

I've been getting depressed because rent is so expensive and I was thinking, using bank calculators that I won't be able to buy a first home either. Then suddenly I realised if I rented out at least one good quality room I would be able to afford quite a reasonably priced house. I also realised that if I had more than one room to rent, the flatmates could pay entirely for the payments and I'd have the spare money for the costs of owning a home. Would a bank allow me to borrow and then rent out rooms to cover the costs?

I resigned from a job where my co-workers were just such wicked, gossiping people.  They were ignorant about other cultures, too.  I left on my own free will but I am just so angry I let them get to me.  The Director of the program didn't even ask me why I was leaving.  She, in my own perception, probably thought I was leaving because I was getting married.  Either way she had some favorites too in the group of girls that were gossipy.  They talked bad about clients, our director, secretary and just obnoxious about those who didn't have money.  I am glad I left and have no regrets.

When I arrived home the other night from work (about 5:45 p.m.) and after pulling my car into my garage and closing the garage door behind my car, I heard someone knocking on the garage door.  I re-opened the door, and a woman in her late 70's was standing there on my driveway.  I said yes?  The woman said her dog was in my garage.  I said what?  She said that her dog was chasing after my car because it looked like her husband’s car and she believes her dog is in my garage.   I said “there is no dog in here.”  Then, she said “there he is over there” (the dog was in my back yard with his leash still attached).  She walked toward her dog on my gravel driveway and fell down.  She was in a sitting position on the ground, but she was unable to get back on her feet.  I tried picking her up but her large dog (I would estimate around 90 lbs.golden retriever) kept jumping on me.  I finally was able to get both my arms under her arm pits and lift her while I stood from behind.  She was very quiet and didn't say anything.  I handed her the leash which was still attached to the dog and she walked away with her dog.      I was quite shaken, as I am sure she was too.  I feel bad.  Everything happened so fast and I immediately had gone into the house to call my husband, that I didn’t get her name, phone number and don’t know where she lives so I can’t contact her to see how she is.  Do you think I should contact my home insurance company?  And, does she have a slip and fall case being that she came onto my property unvited and knocking on my garage door, rather than coming to the front door?  Any legal info. would be welcomed.  Thanks.

I live in the bay area, and me and my husband make close to 90k a year. I have my degree, he does not. We are newlyweds, and live in a one bedroom apartment, with no kids.

20090227125042AACM3Gf	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	I need legal advice.  Should I pay for services not rendered?	My heater broke down 12/21/08.  When the technician came to fix it I told him what was more/less wrong with it from what a friend had adviced me.  It took the service technician 1.5 hours to tell me that my friend was correct.  The technician did not fix the heater but simply made it run for some time.  He asked me to call when it broke down again and that he would send me a bill in the mail.  A couple of weeks later I call to let him know it broke down again.  At this point I had not yet received the bill.  He shows up and tries to fix it again without changing the broken part (mother board).  Again he leaves and again it breaks down.  This goes on until 01/18/09 and he had shown up 4 times without fixing the problem.  The last time he showed up he was drunk and told me he would come fix it on 01/19/09.  The technician doesn't show up so on 01/20/09 I call another technician who comes and fixes it in 30 minutes.  On 01/27/09 I get a bill from the first technician who is charging me $146 for his services.  I write back informing him that he never really fixed anything and that I had someone else fix my heater already.  On 02/23/09 I receive another bill from the first technician threatening to sue me if I don't pay the $146 and put a lien on me.  How could I handle this situation legally?  Should I pay $146 for something he didn't fix?  I've called around to get legal advice but nobody wants to even hear it when I tell them the amount is just $146.  Please advice...

20090227130317AA1jQ74	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	How would you handle this situation in an interview?	I will be graduating in a few months and am going through interviews with several companies. I recently completed an internship that wasn't really an internship, it was more of them having me do the work of an entire department for free. I was interning in public relations, usually in an internship you learn from someone. This company had no PR employees at all, I interviewed with them and they opened the department with me. They told clients I was "one of their many PR employees" and my title was 'public relations supervisor' to anyone outside of the company. In reality, I was the only one doing all of the PR work (press releases, contacting media, ect) When i left they told me that if i applied to any of their competition (fellow ad/pr firms) i shouldn;t reveal my work load because their competition would make them look bad. I was pretty furious but i dont burn bridges so i didn't argue. Well my resume explains that i was their sole PR employee and Im worried that it may come up as an interesting question when people call them for a reference. Im worried this company will call me a liar and say that i didnt do the amount of work i did- that i worked under some other PR person to protect their reputation. How would you address this to a potential employer? it cant come across like im talking crap about my boss, but i dont want them to think im a liar. any ideas on how to handle this best?    thank you

20061130020244AAFHWab	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment	Tips on how to not let my workmate's attitude affect me?	Ok here's the deal. I started working at my job about a month ago, so I'm fairly new. I work with this girl who has worked there a long time. Well, lately she's been in a pissy mood all the time, and I know it's because she hates her job and wants to quit. But she takes it out on me, like everytime I ask her something (which is a lot of times because I'm new but I try to cut back as much as possible because she gets pissed off), or even if I take my break she gets this sourly annoyed look on her face and sometimes doesn't even answer me. When I said goodbye tonight she ignored me... so what are some good tips on dealing with her? I don't want to act the same way she does because that would make me as bad as she is acting.

20090306161524AAUhiK2	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	How can I recieve subsidized housing in an emergency situation?	I have a fifteen month old son and six months pregnant, and I rent a mobile home. My son has been sick and it hasn't gone away. I was curious so I took a look around and I realized  my living room floor was wet I thought I must of spilled something. The next day I looked again and there was some thick white furr or something growing, so I asked my father to take a look and he said it was mold. He knows because my baby brother's lungs collapsed when he come from the hospital because of the mold. He legally died. I don't want that for my son or the unborn child. I have never applied for section eight or anything but I need to move out as soon as I can and I am not finacial okay to go get any place. Thank you

20090306162622AA10efH	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	How does a couple rent an apartment for the first time?	I'm 18 and my girlfriend is 19. We plan on leaving our parents' homes in Southern California to move to San Francisco. Right now we both work. I work at Daphne's Greek Cafe making $8.50 and hour. And she works at Target making $8.00 an hour. We want to move out before the end of the year. We both have no credit history. And apartments in San Francisco are pretty expensive. I was looking online at apartments from $500-$1500 a month. Per paycheck I make about $350 and my girlfriend makes about $400. We get paid every two weeks. How much would we have to save up before we move out? Apartments I found that I liked were $800. Is that too much? We're both going to find new jobs out there. I go to a community college right now and plan to go to a new school up there. Can you tell me how I should plan financially to move out? And don't tell me we're too young or anything like that, this is what we're going to do. We may be young, but it's what we both want; to start a life together.

I know that after the  bubble burst housing prices declined and interest rates went up. People with sub prime and adjustable rate mortgages started to default at high rates which caused the crisis. What I don't know is why the bubble burst. Apparently housing prices had been steadily going up since WW2. How did the housing market loose its strength all of a sudden? Anyone know?
