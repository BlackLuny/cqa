Swo8Xk1Baa	dont liten to the other girl. there probably ARE some. theres a couple girls in my 8th grade class that started working at a resterant when they were in 7th grade. its true, there is equipment they cant handle, so they were paid to be busboys, er, girls.     call around for some family owneed resteraunts and ask. good luck!|`|rijndrSQaa	None.  McDonald's will hire you at 15, most other places until your 16.  There's a lot of equipment you can't legally handle when you're than young.
m9MTQQlyaa	Pat's and Geno's are the tourist cheesesteak capitols and use that cheese whiz crap. a REAL Philly cheesesteak has white American cheese on it (although i have had them with Provolone which may be just a hair better if you like the stronger cheeses). anyway. D'Alessandro's on Henry Ave in Roxborough has a fantastic cheesesteak as does the East End Tavern on the corner of East Street and Cresson in Manyunk. alot of local pizza shops in the Northeast make a great cheesesteak, too.|`|fTjG1KGLaa	a place called Gino's. it the BEST cheese steak in the world!|`|VDpmh2VJaa	it's geno's the one across the street is good also.The two best places are kaddy corner.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geno's_Stea...    here is their menu you can pick before you go..http://www.genosteaks.com/home1.html

LkDgsxGbaa	I've been a server for 25 years and I have put up with some very bad behaviors.  Name calling, threats, temper tantrums (from adults), lying, every form of rudeness known possible.  I watched Primetime "What Would You Do" last week and I got a very good answer to this question.  In one scenario, the show had a woman berating her nanny, loudly, in public.  The show wanted to see if anyone would stand up to this bully.  Afterwards the reporter talked to a psychologist and other people in servile positions about this phenomena.  It appears that there are certain people who, when they feel they are in position of power over someone who can't fight back, lest they lose their job, will become monsters.  According to the psychologist, these people are actually, mentally and emotionally immature.  These types of people actually look for situations where they can bully and fight with others.  It gives them a false sense of superiority.  I used to tell everyone, that I felt, some customers actually come into restaurants because they want to find a place where they can act badly and mistreat people without immunity.  I was kidding, but it turns out, that what I have been saying, as a joke, is actually true.  After years of serving, I have found a job where my boss, doesn't cater to such behaviors and when, these types of people, try this in my current job, they quickly learn it will not be tolerated.  I will never return bad behavior by sinking to their levels.  I will be polite and firm in letting them know that if they persist I will not continue to serve them and it is very possible that they will be removed from the restaurant. If these types complain to my boss they are told in, no uncertain terms, that his servers have the right to refuse service. These personalities are very easy to spot and he will usually ask these people to leave and not come back. These types of people, not only bother the restaurant staff, they upset other diners.  In the past I have had other tables, tell these pests, exactly how they feel about their treatment of me.  There are very well-adjusted people who will not sit idly by while someone is being mistreated, unjustly.  These kind souls are what have made my job a joy and why I still continue after 25 years.|`|f4uYkNwkaa	hmm...|`|maSqXCdEaa	one of the problems I have with customers is when they complain because the service is slow not even taking into consideration that we are short handed or have a packed house    the other is when you hand them the food (either through the front counter or drive-thru), you say "Thank You" yet they don't reply and just drive off or walk off    there are more, but they're mostly every day problems people are familiar with handling|`|4MxCAm6gaa	I feel your pain. These people are everywhere. just remember that these people actually don't even like themselves. we are the better people and they are the lesser beings.......smile|`|pg5AHNcdaa	Yea, some people are just plain rude. They treat us like that, but how would they expect to be treated at their workplace?  I try to treat people I don't know with common respect. Say please, thank you,etc. I don't toss money, talk and place an order, or look down on others. Why should we waste our precious time flushing the toilet?  It's too funny to let others see our junk.|`|9kKgasQcaa	Maybe the people just want to see you stress or see if you can win a tip. Some people are just disgusting and don't know how to act around people. They should show some respect for those who help and not give them(you)crap. Or maybe they aren't doing too well where they live or in their family. They just wanna show their anger and inconsideration to you.|`|DQt3drsaaa	Well, you are in the "people" business.  You are going to encounter, wherever you go, people who aren't nice or considerate.  And a "server" really gets its name from "servant."  If someone couldn't use their cell phones in a restaurant, business would really slack off.  Put up with it, or you're in the wrong business.|`|sJUCJO7Waa	Some people think that their server should be bending over backward for a good tip while others really don't know they are being rude.  I waited tables a country club and you wouldn't believe how snoby and rude the rich people there are.  A lot of people aren't used to eating at restaurants or they may be kind of shy but usually they don't mean to offend you.  When you have customers like this, just give them the service you would any one else and maybe they'll get over themselves.|`|wwlesm5haa	Most of the time its because they have never worked in your position before. ANYONE who has waited tables before has an unspoken respect for you because they know how strenuous the job can be.  I believe that the wave of technology (cell phones, texting, instant messaging, etc.) in our society is killing peoples' ability to have the proper social etiquette to respectfully communicate with others. Its disheartening but, also it makes you appreciate the kind and generous people that ARE still out there.  WOOOSAAAH!!!  Tomorrow will be better! :)  Good Luck.|`|znlHfkkCaa	They prolly think they are better than us because we are in food service. But don't let them get to you because it's just a paycheck it doesnt define you as a person. Oh yea how bout the ones who order their stuff wrong then get upset when its not what they wanted!|`|nlhRlYQvaa	because there ill manerd and so respect for other and think there better then anyone else|`|jfNDo6Beaa	tell me about it, i work at a mcdonalds in a westfield and some of the customers are mean as but the old people are sweet they say thank you and smile at you when you give them there coffee [=    i absolutely hate it when they are on there mobile phone!!!! your trying to take their order and there taking their time and you have 6 other people in line! god    and i hate the people who think your the scum of the earth and talk meanly and get annoyed when you take 4 minutes getting them their meal!      ah well the happy customers always cheer me up [=
k4f7HG8waa	I've got the perfect place for you and your boyfriend!     Ever heard of Zenkichi in Williamsburg? Worth the trip to Brooklyn, believe me.  The menu is Japanese, the restaurant has bamboo, low lighting and mirrors and.......private seating with bamboo shades. The waiter is summoned by a secret button in the booth.     You and your boyfriend can enjoy your meal and each other in total privacy.     You've got to make a reservation!

You will never eat Mickey D's poor excuse for syrup again.|`|JfVxCDb7aa	LOL   Good one    There "delicious" syrup is almost certainly the standard in the fast food industry, so you'd perhaps need to go thru a distributer.|`|maSqXCdEaa	dude, all syrup taste the same and are mostly made using the same ingredients|`|WqkhDIVKaa	Burger King--couldn't resist.

41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	I think sometimes their ingredients just aren't very fresh.  I have the same problem.|`|8tdlP1rOaa	hmm interesting...  maybe its the Subway you're going to???   or maybe it's wut you order that doesnt agree with you.  cause ive got no problem with it|`|n1D90COxaa	love subway and I get all the veggies and I never have a problem.|`|ERP0L3i8aa	Hi Cades Mom - More roughage from salad Is possibly giving the trots.|`|tDKuTKG5aa	I bet you get that way with more foods than from Subway.  There is obviously more to what is going on than blaming it on Subway food.  You should see a doctor about it.|`|nlhRlYQvaa	it could be what you ate trying getting somthing differnt or mixing it up|`|RmNCJ52Laa	You may have an allergy to one of the ingredients. Have you tried eating at one of their competitors? I was told recently that all there meats are actually turkey meat and that they are flavored to taste like ham, roast beef. I don't know how true that is, but I get the same way with McDonald's food.|`|6J5mQWj0aa	i think that its just what ever ou are getting that is making you that way not every subway is like that|`|33e51f7799d322ea5299d7f32d67155caa	The first time was a fluke and now you have psyched yourself out, so that stress is causing your stomach problems.  Just kidding.  I have no idea, really, but I wanted to respond to the reply that it is all turkey and flavored to taste like ham or roast beef.  My husband is allergic to turkey and eats a subway club without the turkey all the time (ham and roast beef) and has never had a reaction.|`|Jp56X1RZaa	Because you eat to many cookies....|`|MxhNzW7Oaa	I had Subway last night for dinner!! I got the Chicken Bacon Ranch with hot sauce! Yumm!!    I think it's the hormones that made you sick. Maybe baby didn't agree with something that was on your sandwich. Or maybe they have tainted veggies. I'm not sure but don't eat it no more so you won't feel poopy.

Jp56X1RZaa	call them and speak to a manager|`|JfVxCDb7aa	yes they do, but expect to get charges extra, or have the order not come out right, be sure to double check the platter before you leave the drive thru.|`|gaXUIduMaa	Ask them if they have a vegetarian version of the platter with cheese instead (like the enchilada platter)  If you ask it that way, you might get it at a lower price.  Generally, if they have the ingredients, they will make it for you.  The only question here is if you have to pay regular price.|`|8WqTvPBbaa	just ask|`|ACaCgLkKaa	they might, every place is different on their orders|`|NLxcfGplaa	I don't know but it sure looks good I might go get one yum!!|`|58i4acBGaa	i imagine so.....you have to remember that if food services want good business they have to learn to be flexible and meet their customer's demands not matter what the need.....|`|QikvnTnqaa	I would guess they would. I don't work there, but I know I've done some "interesting" substitutes for customers before.    Just remember, it's a fastfood place. They will do just about anything special about there food for a price. They may not charge extra, or they might add a buck or two. :)|`|dM8EyL6caa	yes, but you will still have to pay full price for it. Enjoy!!!!|`|JAdNkzENaa	i know for a fact they will do this|`|nlhRlYQvaa	i dont think they would let you|`|saeYdZleaa	ask|`|tDKuTKG5aa	Yeah, I would assume they would allow you to place that order.

On the Dollar Menu, you can get the McDouble.  It's two patties of meat and one slice of cheese.  The Double Cheeseburgers are now $1.29.|`|nlhRlYQvaa	i think they either made it cost more not take it off|`|Oextrh4iaa	no.|`|XNxihzf0aa	its still there|`|HhJPFaEAaa	ZP is right. In order to cut back on cost, still sell it for a buck, and make a profit, they removed a piece of cheese. So obviously they can't call it a DOUBLEcheese anymore, hence the new name McDouble. As far as I'm concerned it's the same great taste, and just as filling, with a little less fat. Cheese is the worst part of the burger!|`|saeYdZleaa	no  they just replaced it with the Mcdouble.  Its the same thing except with one piece of cheese instead of two|`|yYbp9hSLaa	Hmmm..okay you're weird. Anyways its a dollar twenty five and it's been a buck twenty five for like 5 years now. haha|`|4JsyBlZsaa	its an extra 19 cents for the second piece of cheese|`|b4SRMFMyaa	Yes ours are $1.29  now|`|BqZkRfv0aa	they changed the name to the mcdouble and added one less piece of cheese. you can pay the extra cost for the extra cheese, but if you want the closest thing to the original with the original price, get a mcdouble.

bru2xnlRaa	I am glad you posted this question. I have lived in the Sacramento Area all of my life and never heard of this place. A group of 20 friends (me included) meet once a month at a chosen Pizzaria and eat pizza, drink soda or beer, and then rate the restaurant. Our ratings are based on ambiance and pizza. So far Mary's Pizza Shack has scored the overall best. This gives gives us another restaurant that we must try.     So I tried to help you by googling for information. I read how other persons rated this Pizzaria. I read Zelda's website. I couldn't find any special notice about the crust of their pizza, and I couldn't find their recipie for you.     My thought would be to ask them for the recipe. Since you say    " I'm guessing they closely guard their recipe " I will assume you haven't asked them. Call or go in and ask.     Here is their contact info:     Zelda's Original Gourmet Pizza  1415 21ST St   Sacramento, CA 95814  (916) 447-1400   Worth the wait:  The Chicago-style deep-dish pizza is legendary, and so is the service.|`|yYbp9hSLaa	When I typed it into recipezarr.com, I got a few recipes for Zelda's food like fettuccine, but I couldn't get any recipe for the crust.

AA12068233	First, youll need to raise between  $200,000 - 500,000 capital. There will be about a $25,000 initial franchisee fee. Go this website for more information.     http://www.subway.com/subwayroot/Develop...    As to what youll make, your profits will be about 15 - 20% of total sales. Generally, youre looking at 25% labor, 25% food cost, 25% rent/utilities, and a  5 - 7% franchisee + national advertising fee.     If your store does $15,000 in sales a week, your profit would be about $2,700. $140,400 a year. Thats not bad.
