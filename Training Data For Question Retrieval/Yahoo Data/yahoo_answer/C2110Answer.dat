FE8zgE46aa	By using search only you can make about 3-5 Swag Bucks per day.<br>  <br>  The good news is there are lots of other ways to make Swag Bucks.  Probably the best is getting some friends to sign up with your referral link.  You can also keep your eyes peeled for Swag Codes, promotional codes that give you an extra Swag Buck or two.<br>  <br>  Don't give up.  We kept at it and after a couple of months we have gotten enough Swag Bucks to get $65 in Amazon Gift Certificates.  All for searching like we normally would every day.<br>  <br>  If you'd like tips on maximizing your rewards or more info about Swag Bucks check out the blog:<br>  <a href="http://weloveswagbucks.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">http://weloveswagbucks.wordpress.com/</a><br>  <br>  And if you're reading this and haven't signed up yet.. use our link and start with 3 SwagBucks:<br>  <a href="http://swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb-register&rb=289285" rel="nofollow">http://swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb-register&rb...</a><br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|6o4iqjPgaa	i dunno but if u findout let me know... aslo do u know how to use them?|`|AdBWPrK2aa	Well there is no "cheating" or fast way. The swag bucks website does states that there engine only rewards "regular use". I suppose the best way to earn faster is to refer people.<br>  For example if someone clicks on my link and signs up for an account, I get 1 point(buck) for ever point they earn( up to 100 points).<br>  This is my refer link: <a href="http://swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb-register&rb=389113" rel="nofollow">http://swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb-register&rb...</a><br>  You also get "bucks" if you shop with them. I believe for every $5 spent you get one free "buck". You can also enter these "lottery like" events they have. They usually cost one to five "bucks" and you have a change of wining 100, 500 or 1000 "bucks" depending on which lottery you enter.
d645e3c1f0da82127be8455d37dddb8faa	no its a phishing scam after your details - if you responded they would be asking for bank details next|`|0bckNgILaa	No, it's not legit. Do not reply.

8NHJG469aa	if you really love her you are going to love her the way she looks. because you seem more worried about her legs and body than her.|`|uLV4GMIWaa	she's a cheerleader..therefore, she uses her legs a lot, you cannot avoid her muscles there being thick. you cannot burn off muscles. once it's there, it's there. if you like long, slender legs, find another girl. 2 years is a long time. one can develop muscles by then. ask around at gnc, they'll tell you the same thing.<br>  my boyfriend has the same situation, his calves are huge.<br>  <br>  so, no, there is no diet or work out. if you want her, you'll just have to accept her firm legs.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	A True Love is happy no matter how the other person looks.  <br>  You cannot reinvent someone.|`|suPD7c3gaa	If she was a cheerleader, she had firm, muscular legs, not just "thick" legs.  Don't try to mold your gf to your liking.  Nowhere in your details do you say this is something SHE wants to do.  It seems to be about what YOU want.  And you're right... it's impossible to give advice without knowing her body type.  And yes.. it not only sounds  shallow, I think you know it IS shallow, or you wouldn't have made that comment.  How about you love her just the way she is? If she's short, her legs aren't going to be long and slender.  When/if she wants to change the way her legs look, I bet she'll figure it out all by herself.  If she's the athletic body type, she's probably perfect.

53FA3PSNaa	Yahoo does not have a photo site any more they closed it down over a year ago. I do not even remember what the name of it any more.
7u77AiBjaa	JPEG is the format of the file. On the image file name's extension, you may see .jpg, .jpeg, or .jpe. If you have saved the image to your computer and want to add it to your Personal Photos module, open the image in a photo-editing program. <br>  <br>  Microsoft Paint is on most Windows computers with Microsoft software in the Accessories programs section.<br>  - Open Paint, then open that image file from within Paint.<br>  - Click the File Menu, and choose "Save As". In the File Type dropdown area of the pop-up box, choose JPEG<br>  - A box will pop up regarding quality, choose OK<br>  - Choose a location to save the image and click "Save".<br>  <br>  Now, you have the same image saved but as the proper file type - JPEG. The other issue, depending on where you want to use the image in 360, is file size. For backgrounds, the size has to be 250KB or lower. For other areas, it can be 5MB and lower.<br>  <br>  - Click your "My Page" link at the top of your 360 space<br>  - Click "Edit Profile/Personal Photos" over the empty picture frame<br>  - Click "Browse" and upload photo into an empty field. Then click one "use as primary" radio button on the right before saving (if you've uploaded more than one image).<br>  <br>  You can't upload more than 4 profile pictures (this includes an avatar). Make sure that you are following the 360 Personal Photo guidelines here: <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/guidelines/guidelines-06.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui...</a> .|`|53FA3PSNaa	You must save the picture to your computer before you can upload it to 360. Go to the site where the picture is, right click on the picture. A box will open select Save As. Another box will ope asking you where you want it saved. Most people save them in My Pictures.

Y!A owns all of them.<br>  <br>  You can only delete questions that you asked, and you can only do that while they are still 'open'. Once a question is in 'voting' or has been resolved via a Best Answer being chosen, the question belongs to Y!A and is in their database forever (or until they start archiving old Q&As anyway).<br>  <br>  To delete your question while it's still open, go to the question page, pass your mouse over the pencil icon in the toolbar below your question, and click Delete Question.<br>  <br>  :o)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/answers/ask/ask-76322.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/answers...</a>|`|673739cc8cf9ce9f1a5e007efbd067bcaa	No matter if you deleted your account once a question has gone into voting or has been resolved you cannot delete the question.

1ac3781b361a0972a1980084331b52c5aa	To encourage participation and reward great answers, Yahoo! Answers has a system of points and levels. The number of points you get depends on the specific action you take. <br>  <br>  While you can't use points to buy or redeem anything, they do allow everyone to recognize how active and helpful you've been. (And they give you another excuse to brag to your friends.)<br>  <br>  Levels are another way to keep track of how active you (and others) have been. The more points you accumulate, the higher your level. Yahoo! Answers recognizes your level achievements with their special brand of thank you's!<br>  <br>  And finally, as you attain higher levels, you'll also be able to contribute more to Yahoo! Answers - you can ask, answer, vote and rate more frequently.<br>  <br>  For more information about points and levels in Yahoo!

dcWN4v6Jaa	The point of getting higher levels is that you get more privileges. When you get to level 2 you can rate (thumbs up and down). Here are a couple of websites to help. You can delete your answer by clicking the delete button in the small print to delete it. In order to comment you have to go to a resolved question. Then find the comment button. Click that. Type in your comment. Then click submit. There aren't any rewards when you become a top contributor or go to the highest level which is 7. You can send a user a message if the person allows it. You can check by clicking on their avatar. To make a avatar you go to your profile and click on "Edit My Info". Then scroll down until you see the options for the avatars. Click on "Edit My Avatar" or something like that in the blue print. Then a page should come up. Then you make the avatar. Return to Yahoo Answers and go to the Edit My Info page and select the last one as your avatar. <br>  <br>  HOW TO CHOOSE BEST ANSWER FOR YOUR QUESTIONS<br>  <br>  1.

S5H0NmEWaa	Unless the mail was sent by registered delivery, or the sender obtained a proof of posting certificate, then there's nothing you can do. You might well complain to the post office but unless the item was tracked, it could be lost. <br>  <br>  When you consider the volume of post which is delivered each day on each postal route, it is a pretty remarkable service. That's why it's important to make sure that, when you want to send or receive something particularly important, you should make sure it goes by recorded delivery or one of the other methods which means you can check up on it. Sorry.|`|b1znvwnJaa	Do a swapsie. :)|`|GGAgxzJNaa	You can call your neighbors and ask them if they have your mail, or just hope they bring it to you.

Firstly make sure that the person who sent it has sent it. The only other thing I can think you can do is just go up and down the road and see if anyone has had your mail. Saying that though, if they had it, they should have posted it through your door. <br>  <br>  There is a village about 8 miles from mine and it has the same road name as the one I live on.

So if they (and I was) were using it, they could move their files before the March 30th deadline.

To become a Top Contributor, keep these things in mind ??<br>  <br>  ?? Choose a category ??<br>  <br>  ? Pick a specific sub category of all the categories you see to the left of the page. For example, if you are good in science and mathematics, you do not receive a Top Contributor's badge for that category but for its sub categories such as Chemistry, Physics, Math, etc. <br>  <br>  ? You can have a badge in up to three categories which will show under your badge on your profile as well as your id card, which is what you see when you scroll over an avatar.<br>  <br>  ?? Answer a lot of questions ??<br>  <br>  ? Answer many questions in the category that you choose. I would say 25 Answers per week should be a near minimum.<br>  <br>  ? Make sure you mostly answer questions you think you will receive Best Answer to. You need a certain percentage of Best Answers and the more you answer without thinking about this, the harder it will become to get a Top Contributor's badge.<br>  <br>  ?? Best Answer Accumulation ??<br>  <br>  ? Your answers should be to questions you believe you will receive a Best Answer to. Try to answer those questions that have very little or unknowledgeable answers because that gives you a better chance of receiving Best Answer.<br>  <br>  ? The Percentage of Best Answers needed is 10% in the category.<br>  <br>  ??Activity & Contribution??<br>  <br>  ? When you gain the Top Contributor's badge, you have to constantly be on the site.  However, you do not have to not have a life as many people say. Simply 1 hour a day would probably be enough.

Users qualified for the badge will receive it on Monday Morning 12:00 AM California time.<br>  ?
