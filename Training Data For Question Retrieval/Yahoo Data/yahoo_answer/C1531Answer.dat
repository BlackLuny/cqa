kykmpr0Caa	my mum was a warden at elderly housing for 17 years, she had to go round to each bungalow 3 mornings a week to make sure the residents were all ok, if there was anything they needed reporting for repairs etc to the council. the other days she had an intercom in our house and could call each house and talk to the residents   to ask the same basically. <br>  <br>  she used to help them if they were ill and had no family to help out, collect prescriptions etc, done xmas meals for the ones on their own. <br>  <br>  if you didnt want her to call you just had to ask, but she was always there is you needed her. its nothing like someone watching you all the time, where did u get that idea from??|`|df089a1d7acdbf674fc91dddc4748277aa	The warden is like a caretaker, he as no enforcement authority but he can if you fail to live within the rules of the complex report you to the owners, normally they keep out people who should not be there and make sure the occupants keep the place clean and tidy.
de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	I worked in a mask factory as a painter and we used lead based paint, very toxic, they gave us cheap flimsy paper masks which did nothing (years later I was diagnosed with cancer) and there were dozens of latex masks on spindles and we had top paint each one, we did mostly monsters, e.g., Frankenstein, skulls, etc using an air brush. We had regular visits form the FBI because criminals used out masks in the commission of crimes and they would check our customer lists. Once we had a group of transvestites who performed at a club in Miami order 100 pairs of latex breasts, that was funny, painting nipples all day. You had one set of clothes to wear to work and that was it because anything you wore got destroyed, so stiff with paint they stood up by themselves and no way to clean them. I worked the 7-30 shift and we got 20 minutes for lunch, and after every shift I went home and coughed up paint. I think we made about 2.75 an hour.|`|U7sBZKUuaa	Ice delivery. 14 to 16 hour days rolling all over MS and LA in a truck that wouldn't break 40 mph if you dropped it out of an airplane, with no AC, all for $6.50/hour.|`|v1JBAwSTaa	Lifting rolls of carpet weighing 60lbs- 250lbs up flights of stairs then placing them in certain rooms for 6 months straight, although i didn't "lift" the 200+ pounders i carried them on my back nonetheless i was earning $500 a week in cash, and also got ripped in the process.

UjWlvh1naa	I AM BIRACIAL IN MY 30'S, AND ALL MY LIFE ONLY BLACK MEN APPROACH ME,,, SO WHATS UP WITH WHITE GUYS??? ITS OK, ID PROBABLY DENY YOU ANYWAY!|`|K2UspSHAaa	Have to agree with first answer.<br>          I think it's more the white guys not wanting or being somehow intimidated of mixed  and black women.<br>       I imagine that most mixed girls are attracted to both black and white, since they ARE both black and white.<br>          Plus, black men tend to be very very attracted to mixed girls... and women like to feel very very attractive.|`|Dm3AHmG5aa	Good question? But Nicole Richie is biracial and she has a white man. I really think biracial people would date either or, I have a friend that is biracial and her man is white. I can't say that it has much to do with the community though I was thinking that, but my niece who is 10 lives with her mother in a predominately white community, she likes black boys, but her brother likes white girls. I think my niece identifies more with her black family than my nephew does, she wants to come over every weekend that she doesn't have something planned as opposed to my nephew. I live in a very integrated neighborhood though, not just blacks I know most would assume that. So I would think that it has alot to do with what race they identify more with, it has nothing to do with complexion because my niece is very pale with sandy brown hair, her brother looks like a light skinned black boy, my children are mixed, not with white though(native american), but they like blacks, except my 14 yr old daughter she likes hispanic boys! Go figure!|`|WqZYpMwnaa	Yeah!

Maybe seeing it would be a good thing for her.  It might help her to become more tolerant, which I think is really what the movie is trying to do.|`|HUrLVofYaa	This is tricky. I can only suggest that you tell her a convincing lie to make her not want to go.

4db07412ef2c09f8393cb86bf7e153deaa	It depends on what you mean by "work".  Has it been shown that people praying on their own have had a slightly better recovery rate on some illnesses?  Yes there was one experiment like that, but the same exact study showed that meditation on a "positive" word produced the same results.  So it didn't prove the power of prayer so much as the power of a positive attitude.<br>  <br>  As for proof in praying for somebody else or praying for a specific wish, it's almost impossible to get a scientific control group going for that.  How do you gather people who have the same exact disease and roughly the same recovery rates, and only have half of them being prayed for?  Even if you did this, there's no guarantee that nobody else in the "B" group has a family member praying for them.|`|UinOWcMUaa	Yes -- It has changed my life :) God also works out of the Scientific realm -- so even if it wasn't documneted... it would still be true !!|`|a03839710389585e6d78d6e01faf9f91aa	Wow do you want scientific proof of imaginary friends too?|`|dl97DmmYaa	There was one issue of the Reader's Digest sometime in 1998 and they photograph a human brain while in the act of praying or meditating and the result is marvelous. There is a significant change in the mind's area of peace and tranquility similar to sleep when one prays.  Prayer heals the mind of stress and help release chemicals necessary for repair at cellular level.  Cancer patient who opted prayer theraphy heals faster than those who opted from medicine alone.|`|9c7c4192016169baf847ee7ae4705422aa	This is how prayer works.  It does not work from a person to a god.  What it DOES do is work on a person to person level.  Stop considering it prayer, actually, as this is a religious-derived term.  Instead, call it communication.  Since science likely won't be able to explain it even remotely in a couple hundred years I imagine, it will most definitely never be realized for it's true extra-sensory capabilities while we're kicking and screaming.<br>  <br>  Since I only have a way of explaining religiously, here it is.  The direct level of awareness you place into a person of yourself, be it installing knowledge or aspects of you for their consideration, you effectively become their god for as long as they hold that level of awareness.  Now, how much awareness and how strongly they can hold onto the same is something that cannot be quantified or explained at this time without distorting it using religious definitions.  Like warp speed in Star Trek allows you to go long distances, you are limited in what you can do during that time, like moving in a straight line.  The religious definitions have the ability to explain slightly (e.g., using the word "prayer" for example) but you can only go in one direction with it (the direction of the religion).<br>  <br>  Let's say Person A makes Person B aware of something, either intentionally or non-intentionally.  Person A catches Person B's attention while Person B is talking to Person C but makes Person B think that Person A isn't aware of it.  Person B then mistakenly thinks it has an indirect bit of leverage over Person A in that they think they can comehow bring this type of subject up in conversation with A and A will have no idea that B knew.  This is the act of becoming aware.<br>  <br>  Are you with me so far?<br>  <br>  Person A is now Person B's temporary "god" until the feeling of awareness fades.  That awareness "mutates", on a moment by moment basis, from one form to another especially if Person B were concentrating on it.  The doors of communication are now open between A and B.  How much and to what extent I have no idea as each person is different; something that religious folk cannot grasp or comprehend since they are striving to be "like-minded".<br>  <br>  This type of thing happens all the time in bars and night clubs.|`|UWKF7x4faa	Quite the contrary - for some odd reason patients who know they are being prayed for do WORSE|`|oihouY7Naa	No, I don't see how mumbling to yourself can make things happen.|`|pOP0Jt0Qaa	It's been scientifically documented that it doesn't.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/health/2002901053_pray31.html" rel="nofollow">http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/he...</a>|`|b0qKOoBRaa	I have the right to "waste" my time however I choose.

We all get our choice, mind your own.|`|7d49ddbf3b36edeb5a77c20235621a44aa	prayer has been not shown to work but meditation on the other hand holds a very nice place in the medical scientific research field with tested benefits from higher intelligence ,lower blood pressure , and increased longevity.|`|ggjSKphZaa	Yes it has but it has been proven NOT to work.<br>  <br>  Although, as atheist as i am, it sometimes feels good to pretend there is someone who will listen to you.  So ill say its comforting at most.|`|bVHnNqzBaa	Maybe because it is comforting.|`|lXCwInawaa	You don't need a study. I figured out that prayer, and God were fake when I was six.
4ed827eb3f1fda02dd912b12c28bcd7baa	wow that is a really good question. Usually when someone uses the term "History repeats itself, they are not referring to the histories of individuals, but of the greater society as in historical events, kings and queens, wars, that kind of thing. <br>  <br>  For example, Hitler was fully aware that Napoleon's downfall was invading Russia and having his troops bogged down in the Russian Winter, but somehow he felt it his destiny to invade Russia and he met exactly the same fate. So in this instance, we can say that History repeats itself. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately history does repeat itself because as a people, we can never seem to rise above our own greed, selfishness, hatred, blood lust, and desire for power. These lead us to play out the same scenarios over and over again. <br>  <br>  On a personal level, I think it is much easier to change. In fact, there is only one thing you can always change, and that is your MIND. So you may not be able to change society, but you can always change the way you behave. Which means you have the power to make sure that you do not repeat your past mistakes. The secret to this is to simply acknowledge your mistakes. But don't dwell on them or beat yourself up about them. Simply ask yourself in a non-judgemental way, "How can I make sure I never make this mistake again?" then write down 5 different strategies to keep you from making the mistake.<br>  <br>   For example, let's say you were reprimanded at work because you were half an hour late. You were late because you were looking for your car keys. If you don't take any action, you will surely loose your car keys again. But if you ask yourself, "How can I keep from losing my car keys again?" and then you come up with solutions (Put them in the same place every day, hang them up in a special place, etc) So there you are.|`|T4kc0bQmaa	Well I guess it does happen, coz I've seen a lot of my mistakes repeat many times. And also others. But don't worry, coz the second time you'll know just how to react to your mistake. Experience does count|`|6DFhlt4daa	Proverbs: History repeats itself <br>  <br>  History, we know, is apt to repeat itself.<br>  [1858 G. Eliot Janet's Repentance in Scenes of Clerical Life II. x.]<br>  History, it is said, repeats itself. ‥Few but are reminded almost every day‥of something that has gone before.<br>  [1865 H. Sedley Marian Rooke III. v. i.]<br>  History tends to defy the familiar aphorism; whether national or personal, it seldom repeats itself.<br>  [1957 V. Brittain Testament of Experience 11]<br>  Maybe history repeats itself—but I have to have facts.<br>  [1971 A. Price Alamut Ambush xiii.]<br>  <br>  Express oneself in the same way or with the same words, as in Grandma forgets she has told us this story before and repeats herself over and over, or This architect tends to repeat himself--all his houses look alike. A well-known version of this idiom is the proverb History repeats itself, first recorded (in English) in 1561. For example, Her mother also married when she was 18--history repeats itself.

4jyAH75vaa	Really interesting point.  Except that I don't think that many fundamentalists would be content to coexist with the world-at-large.  The fundamentalism movement today seems more interested in forcing their beliefs on the rest of us via laws, constitutional amendments etc. than to simply live peacefully among themselves as the Amish.|`|90b77bbefba2eb318173c23604ffe4d2aa	Once can only wish and hope.  Sorry, that is not being very loving of me.  I have a lot of respect for the Amish. I must work harder on being kinder to those other folks. It is just that it is so hard not to judge those who are judging everyone.|`|fM7yNf8oaa	As America becomes more secular it's going to drive them more towards it, I think. I could totally see it happening.|`|tugre5sFaa	Hopefully.<br>  <br>  Hopefully they'll turn their backs on the all that evil science has given us, such as the printing press, TV, and computers; thus we'll never have to hear their nonsense again!|`|lXCwInawaa	If it means they'll start living in their own communities, I'm all for it.|`|PWankIUpaa	Let me ask you a question? <br>  <br>  Do you not understand that to be a Christan means to follow Christ Jesus Teachings ? <br>   To follow some one means that some one has to lead. <br>    Jesus Leads His people and those who go their own way are NOT following Him. <br>     He has said exactly what He Means and He has set his Laws for Life down in the Holy Word of  God.<br>    He has stated in Many places not just the Revelation to John that anyone who changes the Word of God or adds to it is under His curse! He states this in Isaiah, 2 Kings and several others in both the old and New testaments.  <br>  <br>      Some how you and liberal so called Liberal and Evangelical Christan's believe that you can change the Word of God given by His Holy Self? <br>  <br>       Since when did you become greater than God?  I think you forgot to tell Him  !  There are NO more Revelations from God ,no Prophecies that are New Revelations from Him, When He said it is finished and that to add or take away from His Word , His Revelation of Himself <br>  was to put You under a curse how do you justify this to your self! <br>  <br>      You Cannot serve God by calling His Word  a lie which is what you are doing by trying to give it meaning that it dose not have in its text! <br>  <br>       God is the Author of the Holy Bible not mankind and it is not open to any interpretation by any man! <br>  <br>       He tells us that He we can depend on it to be His Word Infallable and Inerrant.  He has set the Standard  and He has set it as Absolute! and He has preserved it as His Holy Word. You ignore His teachings when you try to impose your self over His word and you have lost His teachings!   <br>  <br>      How can you claim to be Chrisitan if you are not willing to accept Him as your Lord and His Word as the Truth that  He gave you to Follow ?  These are questions you need to answer for your self before you go putting others down for doing What He tells us to do!|`|WX1b747Iaa	One major difference is, the Amish keep to themselves as much as possible, they aren't evangelical. No matter how small the fundy population dwindles down, they'll never get the message to shut up about their faith when people say they clearly aren't interested.|`|AT4idiuPaa	I do not know who you mean by fundies, but the knock on your door guys should go and isolate themselves and start the new world now. Please!|`|Xcri5qeTaa	I don't think many fundamentalists will be willing to give up their lifestyle, the laws which protect their freedoms, etc. Some might isolate, but I think that would be only in the thousands.<br>  <br>  Currently, there's been a lot of effort by US Protestant groups to Christianize the country by pushing their religious beliefs into law and public schools for children in their early teens or younger.<br>  <br>  The push back has been strong, and, honestly, the more they put themselves out there, the more people leave them.|`|4db07412ef2c09f8393cb86bf7e153deaa	I sure hope so.  That would make the internet MUCH more enjoyable.|`|U7sBZKUuaa	They won't watch TV but they have websites? Most of the fundies I have known have the latest home theaters, PCs and such.|`|oTSB5BITaa	I don't agree with your analogy at all, and you have major misconceptions of Amish culture. <br>  <br>  As I see it, many  Fundamentalist are border line radical where the Amish are not that way at all. The Amish do not home school their children, they have their own schools which their children attend. They celebrate many holidays, like Christmas. They do not reject all aspects of modern culture, and they do not separate themselves from society. The Amish do NOT live in separate communities (why do so many people think this?). <br>  <br>  I live in an area with a very large old order Amish population and interact with them on nearly a daily basis. They are active in their communities, and typically are humble, friendly, nonjudgmental people (unlike you). I am much more comfortable around the Amish than I would ever be among Fundamentalist.

It is impossible to answer because there are so many different things that influence how evolution progresses, and those factors can't be predicted before they happen.  What we will evolve into is impossible to define because assuming that we do evolve into a new species, that species does not yet exist, and thus cannot be defined.<br>  <br>  And there is always the chance that we won't evolve at all, but will just go extinct.

As a rule Yeshivahs do not require undergraduate study and the length of time required to complete smichah can vary dramatically between Yeshivahs as can the syllabus.  At one extreem you get some Yeshivahs in Chabad Lubavitch where as long as the person has grown up in a religious home and attended a Chabad Lubavitch school, smichah can be obtained in as short a period of time as 1 year (part of the reason so many men in Chabad communities have smichah).  Most Orthodox Yeshivah's Rabbinical programme is between 5-7 years for smichah (an example of a seven year Yeshivah syllabus for smichah is Tels Yeshivah overseas or Yeshivah Gedolah here in Johannesburg).

How very foolish!<br>  <br>  God gave us sufficient cause to follow Him.  <br>  <br>  Jesus said that if you REALLY want to know if His words were from God or not (implying the existence of said God), then "OBEY  THESE COMMANDS, and you shall know!"  (I believe He was referring to the Sermon on the Mount, starting in the 5th chapter of the gospel according to Matthew.)<br>  <br>  God said, "If you seek for me, you will find me, if you search for me with all your heart (with a humble and honest heart) and I will be found of you, says the Lord."<br>  <br>  He said that He would reveal Himself to the humble; but that He would hide Himself from the proud, the arrogant, the skeptic, the scoffer, and the mocker alike.<br>  <br>  Jesus also said that the ONLY reason people reject Him is "because their deeds are evil, and they love darkness and hate the light!"  (HEY!  Jesus said it, not me!")<br>  <br>  So, there is no excuse for skeptics.  The only reason ANY body EVER does not believe in God is because they don't WANT to believe in God!  They don't want to follow God's moral standards.  They reject Light and Truth, and they rebel against God's rightful authority.<br>  <br>  And while they won't admit it, they KNOW when they've broken God's Laws.  God's Law is written on their hearts as their conscience, and they have no excuse!<br>  <br>  NO!  God will NOT forgive the skeptic.  But yes, God will continue to love them in their insane and foolish ways.

If you're really, specially lucky, you'll know someone who will even meet you when you get there, 'cuz you've already been conversing with him on-line.  You're quite good friends, in fact, and he's a great guy.  You should know:  you've been IM friends for two or three years already.<br>  <br>  Do make sure you arrive with no money.  This could turn out to be a very important part of your career development.<br>  <br>  If you have no IM friend to rely on, just hang around the bus depot when you arrive.  Try to look as if you have nowhere to go.<br>  <br>  Sooner or later, some nice, friendly guy will strike up a conversation with you.  Maybe he'll even take you to a burger joint for a meal. He'll ask you lots of questions about yourself and be real interested in you.

It'll be the least you can do for him, after his generosity, right?  And maybe he even loves you for real, if he wants you as his girlfriend and all.  Don't be surprised when he buys clothes and little gadgets and electronics for you, too.  Maybe you'll even be grateful enough to have sex with his friend, too.  And other friends.  Funny how his "old" girlfriends keep re-appearing, too, and hanging around.<br>  <br>  But don't object when he sometimes seems to be having sex with them, too.<br>  <br>  And then he tells you one day how much you owe him for all the money he's spent on you since you came to town.  Or you object to sleeping with yet another of his "friends," and that's when he breaks the bad news.  <br>  <br>  Yup, he was keeping tabs all along.  You might object that you thought he was making a gift of it all to you, but he'll quickly set you straight.  <br>  <br>  Naturally, you want to pay him back.  Naturally.  He'll look like he wouldn't allow it even if you didn't, besides.<br>  <br>  Naturally, he has a few suggestions for how you can pay off all that debt.  Some of them involve getting some of his "friends" that you sleep with to give you cash in exchange for the sex, so you can pay him off.  Or maybe he'll show you the sexy things he'd really *love* to see you wearing -- and wouldn't it be fun to model them not only for him, but for all the "friends" visiting in this club he knows of, or owns.  Of course, long before now, you've realized that there is no point in *not* following his "suggestions."<br>  <br>  Congratulations!  You've embarked on your career as a prostitute!

Escort services, for instance. Also, many times women will go to strip bars and indirectly pursue payment for favors, and many post in local newspapers under the guise of massage services.<br>  <br>  As for strippers, they just get a license, go to a club, try out, and if they can shake it good enough, they get hired.|`|GPznIhzMaa	Easy-- they join an escort service or walk into a strip club and ask if they're hiring. They can also seek out Red Light Districts.
VGij9p0Taa	My mums half Jewish her father was Jewish and died when my mum was 15. She isn't Jewish though she brought us up to be Christians but the Jewish faith is semi influenced within my upbringing! Even though I'm a Christian/Catholic. <br>  Anyways I wouldn't approach them in the street as they'd probably take it offensively however if you interact with other Jews maybe help at the synagogue (their place at worship) offer to do voluntary work in a Jewish community you could this way build a relationship, with someone. However, if you ask someone of the Jewish faith politely about their faith etc I'm sure they would take offensive but like it that someone of a different culture is taking an interest I'm sure they wouldn't judge you. It's your life and I wouldn't worry about they way the dress. My Jewish family are very nice people apart from one, lol. <br>  I hope this helped in some way!|`|DvZdB66maa	Visit a jewish synagogue for a service.

2h8tqOeFaa	Firstly Jesus died and rose after the Crucifixion, but i know this wont make you believe so i'll jump on your wavelength to convince you.. <br>  <br>  Do you believe in the paranormal? and if so what do you believe it is, <br>  <br>  have you ever had a paranormal experience as in seen something that seemed like a ghost or something that cannot be explained that frightened you? <br>  <br>  if not then have you ever been scared to walk through a graveyard at night by yourself or would you ever stay in a known haunted house by yourself.. <br>  <br>  If any of the above has ever affected you in anyway then you believe in life after death, if they honestly haven't then i would challenge you to do just one of the above and prove that it would not affect you..<br>  <br>  One more thing, if you do ever see what we call a ghost then you may or may not have just seen a dearly departed because only through God can the departed reveal themselves to you.. <br>  <br>  If this so called ghost tries to put fear in you in any way shape or form then you may have just seen a messenger of evil which is a demon in disguise, if this ever happens to you then if you pray in the name of the lord Jesus Christ it will go away immediately so don't worry..<br>  <br>  So try it, go spend a night in a known haunted graveyard by yourself and tell me if you saw something scary, but if you think you'll be scared i advise you not to do it..

Christ was only the first of a great harvest of those who will be raised to life again. Physical death came through one man, Adam, to whom we are all related. But all who have been adopted into God's family through faith in Jesus Christ will be given new life (1 Corinthians 15:20-22: 20 But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. 21 For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man. 22 For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive). Just as God raised up Jesus' body, so will our bodies be resurrected upon Jesus' return (1 Corinthians 6:14: By his power God raised the Lord from the dead, and he will raise us also).  <br>  <br>  Although we will all be eventually resurrected, not everyone will go to heaven. A choice must be made by each person in this life, and this choice will determine the eternal destination. The Bible says that it is appointed for us to die only once, and after that will come judgment (Hebrews 9:27:  Just as man is destined to die once, and after that to face judgment). Those who have been made righteous by faith in Christ will go into eternal life in heaven, but those who reject Christ as Savior will be sent to eternal punishment in hell (Matthew 25:46:   “Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.”).<br>  <br>  Here's a story of someone who spent 90 minutes in heaven.  It's not WHY we believe, but it's something to think about.

Some Roman Catholics (including this one) abstain on Wednesday, eat meat if we choose on Thursday, and abstain on all Fridays in Lent. I don't like meat that much, so it's not uncommon for me to go all three days without touching the stuff.<br>  <br>  Orthodox Christians usually observe much more stringent rules of fasting throughout Lent. You'd have to ask a Greek or Russian Orthodox believer, but I know that there used to be a long list of foods that they gave up all throughout the Lenten season.<br>  <br>   I moderate a small online prayer group, and I post Lenten recipes. Some of the ones from the Greek Orthodox cookbook are REALLY stringent.|`|415b73f4e9911495575d995988a025aeaa	Catholics are required to both fast and abstain from meat on Ash Wednesday, the first day of Lent.<br>  <br>  On each Friday of Lent until Easter, Catholics are required to abstain from meant for the day.<br>  <br>  On good Friday, Catholics are required to both fast and abstain from meat.<br>  <br>  To abstain means to refrain from the consumption of the flesh of any warm-blooded animal. However, fish, eggs, and dairy products are permitted.<br>  <br>  Fasting is defined by the Vatican as partaking only in 1 regular sized meal and 2 small meals.<br>  <br>  Bear in mind that these requirements are only the minimum.

rv2Iy1Y7aa	This sentence calls for the ablative absolute.  It translates as "Porcis alitis a lanio in tabernam a eo ducebantur (ducti sunt)."|`|7GWENFgIaa	porci a lanio alati in tabernam ab eo ducti sunt<br>  <br>  ----<br>  <br>  "a lanio": ablative of agent, "by the butcher"; goes with "alati", described next.<br>  <br>  "alati": "having been fed"; perfect participle of "alo, alere, alui, alatus" (to feed). Used here as an adjective modifying "porci"; note how it agrees in both number and gender (i.e. masculine nominative plural). Recall as well that perfect participles are passive ("having been"). Compare with the perfect passive conjugation "ducti sunt", below.<br>  <br>  "in tabernam": note the use of the accusative with "in" to indicate motion, i.e. "into"; if it were ablative ("taberna"), then it would indicate location, i.e. "inside".<br>  <br>  "ab eo": "by him"; another ablative of agent; eo is abl. of "is" (from "is, ea, id"); this one goes with "ducti sunt", described next.<br>  <br>  "ducti sunt": 3rd pers. pl. pass. perf. of "duco, ducere, duxi, ductus". Note that, like "alati", the participle agrees with the plural nominative "porci", and, since it's plural, we need "sunt" to complete the conjugation.<br>  <br>  * the ablative of agent is always used with perfect participle adjectives ("alati") and perfect passive tense verbs ("ducti sunt") to specify who/what is doing the action to the subject of the sentence ("porci").<br>  <br>  * The above translation follows conventional Latin word order, i.e. verb at the end. To further clarify the sentence, here it is in English order.<br>  <br>  porci alati a lanio ducti sunt in tabernam ab eo<br>  <br>  -----<br>  <br>  Without getting into too much detail, note how the participles "alati" and "ducti", can be used as adjectives or verbs. Consider this rearranged example:<br>  <br>  porci in tabernam a lanio educti, ab eo alati sunt<br>  <br>  the pigs [having been] led into the store by the butcher were fed by him
MirV9kSsaa	yes muslims can ''pray'' at home or at the mosque,no specific room just a clean one (using a prayer rug is optional,muslims can pray on any floor just that the prayer rug is always clean)<br>  <br>  before we pray we must clean ourselves by performing something called ''wudu'' which is basically washing ur hands,mouth,nose,arms,face,head and feet 3 times,in order to be clean when praying to God.<br>  <br>  after that we face ''Qibla'' which is the direction of the Ka'ba in Mecca.<br>  and then we start our prayers.|`|AORcLwTNaa	pray while having wudhu. look it up on google, its basically washing our hands, mouth, nose, face, arms, hair, ears, and feet. the whole process takes 30 seconds. theres no specific room, but the area has to be clean. and women must wear the headscarf, if u need help specifically email me|`|ou20w5sCaa	Bismillahi Rahmani Rahim - In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful<br>  <br>  Hello.  Well, Muslims are obligated to pray five times a day.  We can do this wherever we are, be it the mosque, work, out at a park, or at home. <br>  <br>  In order to be ready for prayer, we must have first "ghusl" and then "wudu".  Ghusl is a full bath that you must take after having marital relations, or for women when her montly period ceases or when the post-natal bleeding ceases.  After that, for each prayer you should have wudu'.  This means we wash our hands, arms, face, head, and feet before prayer.  We don't have to do a new wudu' for each prayer, but we do if we go to the bathroom, pass gas, or sleep deeply.<br>  <br>  After we have made our ablution, we must be sure we are dressed correctly.  Men must cover between the navel and the knees, and it is better for them to wear a shirt of some kind.  The fabric must be loose and not see-through.  Women cover everything but face and hands.  A lot of women keep a special prayer outfit handy so they will always have something easy to put on when the time to pray comes.<br>  <br>  We pray facing the "qiblah", which is the direction of Makkah in Saudi Arabia.  This qiblah depends on where you are.  For instance, in the eastern US, my qiblah is northeast.  We try to find the qiblah immediately when we move into a house or apartment so we can be sure we are praying in the right direction.<br>  <br>  A lot of Muslims pray on a prayer rug, though this is not required.  You can pray on carpet or bare floors as long as the area is clean.  You pray facing the qiblah, and you have a "sutrah" or barrier, in front of you so no one walks in front of you while you are praying.  If the husband is home, he leads everyone in prayer.  A mother leads the women in the house and her small children.  An older son would act as prayer leader if his father is not home.<br>  <br>  There is no specific place one must pray in the house but a lot of Muslims like to set aside a room or a place in a room that is free of distractions such as pictures and electronics.  It helps you concentrate on your prayer.<br>  <br>  The prayer itself has a particular formula of words and movements, and we pray five times a day.  The first prayer is before dawn, the second just past noon, the the late afternoon, then the prayer just after sunset, then the night prayer.  <br>  <br>  In addition to the five formal prayers, Muslims can "pray" informally anytime, asking God for our needs and praising Him, and it is not necessary to have wudu' to do this.  It is our habit to have good words on our tongues instead of bad words. <br>  <br>  That's about it for the formal worship.  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  May Allah guide you to the best in this world and the next.

dc00e6f724cc094e75dc0475843d0e44aa	Christ said many things when he lived here upon the earth.  He taught us what we should do to inherit eternal life.  It was very clear what was expected of his followers when he walked the earth, including: "There shall be one faith, one baptism...."   <br>  <br>  Yet, there are so many different Christian denominations upon the earth today, with differeing and sometimes totally conflicting doctrine, that it seems there is no longer "one faith, one bpatism" any more.<br>  <br>  So what is a person to do?  What is a sincere seeker of Christ supposes to do to learn of the true doctrine of Jesus Christ, the one that he established?<br>  <br>  The Bible is a source.  Yet, it has had so many translations into different languages, many doctrines are changed from one translation to another.      (I have studied a Korean translation where many who passages of scripture are left completely out of the Korean Bible----how can ALL of its truths be in there if that is the case). <br>  <br>  When Christ was upon the earth, he established a church with PROPHETS.<br>  <br>  See Acts 15:32<br>  32 And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.<br>  <br>  NOTE:  These men were upon the earth AFTER Christ.   So it is incorrect by the BIBLE, that when Christ said, "It is finished," that there should not be any more prophets.<br>  <br>  <br>  Ephesians 2:19-20<br>   19 Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;<br>    20 And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;<br>  <br>  <br>  Prophets were part of the church that Christ established, with Christ being the "chief cornerstone."<br>  <br>  <br>  Ephesians 4:11-12<br>   11 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;<br>    12 For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:<br>  <br>  <br>  How are we edified and perfected in Christ?  <br>  By being taught by prophets and apostles!!<br>  <br>  <br>  ITS ALL IN THE BIBLE that we need prophets.<br>  <br>  There is a church today, that is organized in the same manner that Christ established the church in his day.

God hasn't lost power else he wouldn't be God anymore.<br>  2.  He doesn't want to speak to us, he doesn't love us anymore.<br>  2A.  Unacceptable.  God loves his children all the time, unconditionally.<br>  3.  We don't need him anymore so he doesn't have to speak to us.<br>  3A.  Preposterous.  We need him now more than ever.<br>  This exchange took place at the beginning of world war II.  I think today it is equally relevant.  That is why the heavens are open, because we do need Him, He does love us, and He is perfectly willing and able to speak to us and give us direction via prophets.<br>  Revelation is available to all who seek it for themselves and their respective responsibilities.<br>  Prophets are responsible for all the inhabitants of earth.  Thus revelation for the benefit of all the inhabitants of earth is given to them.|`|AA11713693	Well I am from a religion that has prophets.

Unfortunately most will use this as another excuse to bash Mormonism and our church. Even if I were not LDS  I would say that Prophets make sense. God gave his first children prophets in the beginning and I know he would not deny us, his younger children, the same privilege. God is the same yesterday, today and forever. His methods of communicating with us would not change, nor would He cut us off. <br>  <br>  Edit to "Question Mark":  the passage you are referring to in the Bible is in Revelations. If you have studied Bible history, you would know that the books of the bible are not grouped in chronological order. Revelations was actually written before many of the other books. So that negates your argument. <br>  <br>  To "SexIsOnFire":  You are an idiot!!  That has never happened in the LDS church.

zZxX5PXBaa	Are you aware that what you've quoted is about 50% Bible and about 50% commentary from some individual?<br>  <br>  If you want to see the passage in a modern translation you can try this link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2019%20;&version=31;" rel="nofollow">http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?sea...</a><br>  <br>  You can change between a number of different versions  using the menu near the top.<br>  <br>  I'm a bit puzzled by some of the commentary, frankly. It's very eccentric. For instance, in v. 33 the commentary says 'To lie with the father, is to disclose intimate secrets about this person that they want to capture.' This is,nonsense. To lie with, in this passage, simply means to have sex with. They had sex with Lot, their father, and they both got pregnant.<br>  <br>  Read the passage and think about it as you'd read any text. The girls say 'There's nobody around to have sex with'  ... they add the bit about preserving the family line. It's true that preserving the family line mattered very much to people in that culture, it's also true that someone who is desperate for sex will look for anything to justify whatever they do to get it. The bible is like any other text, it has subtext.<br>  <br>  Two girls, no young men, Dad's a drunk, but not so drunk he can't get an erection. Very quickly we have a code for 'let's sleep with Dad' and that code is 'let's preserve our family line'. And do you seriously believe Lot had no idea at all what was happening? Don't you think that 'he was not aware of it' might mean something closer to 'He pretended not to know'? If I were writing a story like that, I know I would be very inclined to say 'And Lot had no idea what had happened', but I know I would be expecting the reader to have the wit to recognise the sarcasm.<br>  <br>  In the wider story, both the Moabites and the Ammonites are constant enemies of Israel, much later when the Israelites take possession of the promised land. The story of Lot functions in the Old Testament mainly to show why Moab and Ammon should be such vile nations, being born, as they both are, of incest and lust. About the only bit of your commentary that is anywhere near the mark is the bit about the cave having the connotation of an animalistic life. Lot chose the prosperous ground, and the pleasures of 'civilisation', and ended up in a squalor and depravity that most animals would be ashamed of.<br>  <br>  With a considerable sense of irony, later in the Old Testament, the book of Ruth reintroduces Moab, in the perso of Ruth, the Moabitess, who returns to Israel with her mother in law, after Ruth's husband has died. And she eventually marries Boaz, who becomes her 'kinsman redeemer' (the role which Lot is shown grotesquely caricaturing) and becomes part of the family line that leads to Christ.|`|macZI2dzaa	Your interpretation is quite interesting, but it seems to have nothing to do with the text of Scripture.<br>  Note we do not know what age the daughters of Lot were, a good guess is that they were both in their 20's.<br>  The fact that the two daughters named the sons they bore through their father provides an interesting study in the names.  <br>  Moab literally means 'water' (implied 'seed') of the 'father'.  Moab was literally from the 'seed' (semen) of Lot, the daughter's father.  The name mocks the father.   Ammon means 'from my people'.  Again this is mockery of Lot.  Indeed Ammon was not just 'from my people' but incestuously "from my father".  <br>  Both the Moabites and the sons of Ammon were the enemies of Israel.<br>  Truth is God actually saved a Moabite woman and placed her in the line of Christ, so I seriously doubt the name means stingy.  Read the book of Ruth (only 4 chapters) to see God's grace to a helpless woman of a cursed people.   God provides a kinsman redeemer for any who will step out in faith toward God. <br>  I recommend a serious, grammatical and historical interpretation of Scripture.|`|lEPGcFqFaa	In actuality, the name moab means "son of the mother's father" and Bennami means "son of my people" and Ammon means "inbred".  These incestous sons proved to be a thorn in the side of Israel with a very limited future.|`|Ne9rXERpaa	Exactly what it sounds like.
fbb856fb364e1969ae9d33b1092a6feaaa	Look up www.teacch.com<br>  <br>  I used to work with children and young adults with severe autism and challenging behaviours. They need 1:1 support, routine, structure etc 24/7. Children with autism are not best placed in generic special needs schools as these do not cater for the nature of the disorder. <br>  What is your brother using to communicate (e.g. PECS)? And what medication is he on? There are a lot of successful behavioural approaches to managing autism. I've seen varying outcomes of children with ASD on medication... some positive, some not so positive.<br>  You need to provide your brother with structure from the moment he wake up to when he goes to bed. Things like picture or photo schedules can let him know what place he needs to go to next e.g. bathroom then kitchen. Then you have worksystems which are also mini-schedules of what you would want your brother to do in that location e.g. wash hands. <br>  You also need to think about antecedents to periods of distress; are there specific things or situations that cause your brother to become distressed and aggressive? Can you do anything to prevent these from occurring? Also, how do you respond? Most children I worked with were best calming down with space, no eye contact and no verbal communication. There are huge sensory issues too. <br>  <br>  There is so much to suggest that I can't possibly fit it all on here. Please do look at the TEACCH website. I've done some of their training and it really is fantastic. There are also lots of schools set up to provide education specifically for children with autism.|`|a04dbf9b8ee50b469c5a723cd1169d72aa	I know in the US at least your best bet is to call your county's department of human services.

They will be able to sit down with you and your family and help you figure out what the best situation for your brother and your family is.

kVcy1VRyaa	I'm not entirely sure how to convince him- everyone's different.

After all, you have nothing to hide do you?|`|K6cHlzAkaa	yes you should be mad; plus you can't convince him your'e not a cheater-he has to draw his own conclusions. why? b/c you tried already. wait for him to grow up and stop snooping or get out now with your dignity intact.|`|FpMS47sXaa	This is my advise.<br>  <br>  Delete the texts and pics (if there are any) and stop texting this person. Your bf is more important than some random guy, right? Then do what you can to prove to your bf that you are not cheating. You have to regain his trust.<br>  <br>  Should you be mad? <br>  To me, no. I look at it this way, if you are in a relationship with someone, there is a level of privacy your fore go. If you don't want anyone being suspicious, don't give them any reason to be.<br>  <br>  You could turn this whole thing around on him and tell him that if he did trust you, he wouldn't have looked through the phone. But, seriously, after 15 yrs of a relationship I can say that it will be a losing battle. Just admit you did something that caused him to be suspicious. Admit the mistake and move on from it. That is the easiest and best way to resolve this problem.|`|OqviBejiaa	If you have to convince him you're not cheating, you probably shouldn't stay together. He needs to trust you. <br>  <br>  The fact that he went through your phone shows he was suspicious before he ever saw those texts.

If you're flirtacious, then perhaps you could stop being a flirt.  But, in general, I don't think you can convince insecure people that you're not cheating.|`|7nHuDxivaa	It is an invasion of privacy, but you have to be honest with yourself and him if you are doing anything to give him the suspicion.<br>  <br>  If the messages were inoccent and you have nothing to hide you should be fine.|`|R9fsNpYPaa	Well you should interduce the new random guy to him to make him feel like he's overdramatic feeling of him thinking you are cheating on him.|`|eGtZXgRHaa	1) Well, yeah you can be mad he went through your phone.<br>  <br>  2) He should be mad that you didn't talk to him about this guy in the 1st place.<br>  <br>  3) If you're really not cheating on him, then he should trust you... If you feel like he doesn't believe you, then talk to him about it. At least he'll know you care about his feelings, and he'll see you're not scared to talk about this (which would be kinda suspicious if you were...)<br>  <br>  Good luck with your lover ;)

If you're giving it up as a ritual because that's the way things go, then you might as well not give it up because your sacrifice is meaningless. But if you're really giving this up as a way of fasting and bringing yourself closer to God, then more power to you.<br>  <br>  I would say try and make a substitution for coke and chocolate.

db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	Previously Jesus mentioned that He came to earth for judgment. But in John 8:15 He mentioned that He passed judgment on no one. What did He exactly try to say?<br>  <br>  The greek word in John 9:39 for judgment meant he came to make a decision about those who are for God and those who are against God.

Of this [good news] I Paul became a minister.<br>  <br>  Yes the good news about Jesus Christ was preached in every nation of that time.Jesus sent out his disciples by twos teaching them what to say.<br>  (Acts 20:20) while I did not hold back from telling YOU any of the things that were profitable nor from teaching YOU publicly and from house to house.<br>  Jesus said at Matthew 24:14And this good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come.<br>  <br>  (Matthew 28:19-20) Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit, 20?teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded YOU. And, look! I am with YOU all the days until the conclusion of the system of things.”<br>  <br>  This was a direct command to his disciples today that Good News about the Kingdom of God is being preached in 236 lands and nations in hundreds of languages all around the world,in fact the whole world has been covered with the good news of GOd's Kingdom that he taught us to pray for (Matthew 6:10) Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth.(Isaiah 65:17-25) “For here I am creating new heavens and a new earth; and the former things will not be called to mind, neither will they come up into the heart. 18?But exult, YOU people, and be joyful forever in what I am creating. For here I am creating Jerusalem a cause for joyfulness and her people a cause for exultation. 19?And I will be joyful in Jerusalem and exult in my people; and no more will there be heard in her the sound of weeping or the sound of a plaintive cry.” 20?“No more will there come to be a suckling a few days old from that place, neither an old man that does not fulfill his days; for one will die as a mere boy, although a hundred years of age; and as for the sinner, although a hundred years of age he will have evil called down upon him. 21?And they will certainly build houses and have occupancy; and they will certainly plant vineyards and eat [their] fruitage. 22?They will not build and someone else have occupancy; they will not plant and someone else do the eating. For like the days of a tree will the days of my people be; and the work of their own hands my chosen ones will use to the full. 23?They will not toil for nothing, nor will they bring to birth for disturbance; because they are the offspring made up of the blessed ones of Jehovah, and their descendants with them. 24?And it will actually occur that before they call out I myself shall answer; while they are yet speaking, I myself shall hear. 25?“The wolf and the lamb themselves will feed as one, and the lion will eat straw just like the bull; and as for the serpent, his food will be dust. They will do no harm nor cause any ruin in all my holy mountain,” Jehovah has said.With that I heard a loud voice from the throne say: Rev.21:3,4“Look! The tent of God is with mankind, and he will reside with them, and they will be his peoples. And God himself will be with them. 4?And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore.

Those who are spiritually blind have their eyes opened through obedience to my gospel and shall see the things of the Spirit. Those who think they can see in the spiritual realm, but who do not accept me and my gospel shall remain in darkness and be made blind to the true spiritual realities.'   <br>  <br>  'In rejecting me as the Light of the World, ye are showing a lack of spiritual discernment; your judgment is warped by carnal and worldly things. But I am not like you; I do not have the spirit of murder and bitterness in my heart, nor am I judging you on the basis of hate or envy or unbelief-for all these things pertain to the lusts of the flesh. Yet if I should judge you at this time (as I shall at the judgment bar) my judgment would be true and just, for I would judge on the basis of true principles given me by the Father who sent me and whose Son I am.'|`|ARUinuP7aa	Question 1. Jesus was speaking of spiritual blindness. Those who will believe in Him though they were blind they will begin to see,and those who will not believe in Him though they have a little understanding it will be taken from them that they may become blind spiritually.<br>  <br>  People judge one another by human standard. Jesus never judge anyone by human standard. His judgment will come later but it is divine judgment.<br>  <br>  Question 2. Though Jesus was talking to His disciples at that time, the preaching of the gospel to all nation can be accomplished by the succeeding followers of Christ until the end of time.<br>  <br>  God bless you.|`|TOBYij3Qaa	Joh 9:39-41  <br>  Christ came into the world to give sight to those who were spiritually blind. Also, that those who see might be made blind; that those who have a high conceit of their own wisdom, might be sealed up in ignorance. The preaching of the cross was thought to be folly by such as by carnal wisdom knew not God. Nothing fortifies men's corrupt hearts against the convictions of the word, more than the high opinion which others have of them; as if all that gained applause with men, must obtain acceptance with God. Christ silenced them. But the sin of the self-conceited and self-confident remains; they reject the gospel of grace, therefore the guilt of their sin remains unpardoned, and the power of their sin remains unbroken.<br>  <br>  Joh 8:12-16  <br>  Christ is the Light of the world. God is light, and Christ is the image of the invisible God. One sun enlightens the whole world; so does one Christ, and there needs no more. What a dark dungeon would the world be without the sun! So would it be without Jesus, by whom light came into the world. Those who follow Christ shall not walk in darkness. They shall not be left without the truths which are necessary to keep them from destroying error, and the directions in the way of duty, necessary to keep them from condemning sin.<br>  Mar 13:9-13  <br>  <br>  Enduring Persecution<br>  Jesus' first caution to "take heed" involves the disciples' reading of the time and signs of religious cultism, social violence, and natural disaster. As traumatic as these events may be, the disciples are urged to avoid panic because they occur in each human generation and are preliminary, not final, signals of the end-time.<br>  Suddenly, Jesus shifts from a large, cyclical view of world events to the immediate, personal situation of the disciples when He says, "But watch out for yourselves" (Mar_13:9). The disciples must have been rocked at their roots to hear that persecution in their lifetime is to be a timely sign for coming destruction. In the days ahead, they can expect five signs: (1) persecution by the Jews; (2) witness to the Gentiles; (3) filling of the Spirit; (4) betrayal by families; and (5) hatred from the public.<br>  Persecution by the Jews. Betrayal and beatings at the hands of fellow Jews await the disciples. The hidden tragedy is that their betrayal will be perpetrated by the Sanhedrin, whose sacred trust is the preservation of justice, and that their beatings will take place in the synagogue, which is supposed to be dedicated to the love of mercy. The prophecy has a familiar ring to the ears of the disciples. Three times in the prediction of His own Passion, Jesus says that He will be "delivered up" into the hands of men, specifying the chief priests and scribes who are pledged to see Him die. In His prophecy of the disciples' passion, Jesus brings them into the "fellowship of His sufferings" (Php_3:10), a role of highest honor.<br>  Witness to the Gentiles. Betrayed, arrested, arraigned, condemned, and beaten by Jewish authorities, the disciples must also watch for the sign of being brought before the secular authorities, rulers and kings of the Gentile world. Jesus adds the beautiful phrase, "for My name's sake" (Mar_13:13), as the code of identification between Him and His disciples during the time of persecution. Later on, this thought, "for My name's sake," will be on their lips as they take lashes, face lions, hang on crosses, and burn at the stake. Jesus, however, does not prophesy the punishment that they will receive from the rulers and kings of the Gentiles. Rather, He foresees the privilege the disciples will have to testify before these authorities as a means for preaching the gospel to all nations.<br>  We do not like to think that persecution is a major vehicle for proclaiming the gospel, but it is. Peter, James, John, and Andrew will prove the point themselves in the Acts of the Apostles and in the unwritten history of their missionary ventures and martyrdom. In all the classes, seminars, conferences, and congresses I have attended on the subject of world evangelization, no one has ever proposed "Proclamation Through Persecution" as the strategy for fulfilling the Great Commission. Of course, persecution cannot be planned, but the evidence keeps coming in that it is the Christian's most effective witness. We were visitors to South Korea in the early 1970s during the time that 125,000 soldiers sealed their new-found Christian faith in baptism. Anxious to find out why revival fires burned so brightly in the Korean church, I asked a pastor "Why?". Without hesitation, he explained, "You must remember that our people are less than one generation away from martyrdom." Few, if any, Christian families in Korea were missed in the martyrdom of the 1950s.<br>  Across the world, it is estimated that 60 percent of those who profess the name of Christ are under persecution. While the other 40 percent have the knowledge, wealth, and technology to proclaim the gospel to all nations, time and eternity will|`|qyoXSdPCaa	To answer Mark 13:9-10 You must read the whole chapter not just pick out certain verses.  You will come to understand that it was not the death of the apostles of Jesus that is spoken of but the destruction of Jerusalem. <br>   The Jews, in rebelling against the Romans, and in persecuting the Christians, were hastening to their own ruin. Setting both God and man against them; see <1 Thes. 2:15>. This is a prediction of that ruin which came upon them within less than forty years after this:  The destruction of Jerusalem.<br>   The church-rulers shall inflict their censures upon them; They would be delivered up to the great Sanhedrim at Jerusalem, and to the inferior courts in other cities, and would be beaten in the synagogues with forty stripes at a time, as offenders against the law which was read in the synagogue. It was nothing new, through the treachery of its officers, to be turned against some of its best friends.<br>             Governors and kings would use their power against them. The Jews had no power to put them to death, they used the Roman powers against them, as they did Herod against James and Peter; and they would be put to death, as enemies to the empire. They should resist even through torture.             <br>   They were to comfort themselves with the work they were called to do by spreading the gospel, and should carry on and prosper, against all opposition which they should meet with in it (v. 10); The gospel shall, for all this, be published among all nations, and before the destruction of Jerusalem (not the death of the apostles of Jesus) the gospel would go forth into all the earth; not only through all the nation of the Jews, but to all the nations of the earth." It is comfort to those who suffer for the gospel, that, though they may be crushed and borne down, the gospel cannot; it shall keep its ground, and carry the day.<br>  <br>  <br>  As for John 8 and 9: Matthew Henry's Commentary has to say the following.<br>  <br>  “Because they were unjust and unfair towards him, intimated in this: "I judge no man; I neither make nor meddle with your political affairs, nor does my doctrine or practice at all intrench upon, or interfere with, your civil rights or secular powers." He thus judged no man. Now, if he did not war after the flesh, it was very unreasonable for them to judge him after the flesh, and to treat him as an offender against the civil government. Or, "I judge no man," that is, "not now in my first coming, that is deferred till I come again," <Jn 3:17>. Prima dispensatio Christi medicinalis est, non judicialis-- The first coming of Christ was for the purpose of administering, not justice, but medicine.<br>   3. That his testimony of himself was sufficiently supported and corroborated by the testimony of his Father with him and for him (v. 16): And yet, if I judge, my judgment is true. He did in his doctrine judge <Jn 9:39>, though not politically. Consider him then,”<br>  (from Matthew Henry's Commentary)|`|UITfm0fjaa	Q 1 - Notice John 9:39 never actually says that Jesus judges.

The one thing that is clear and has not changed is the actual WORLD it's more than we are able to grasp.|`|lEPGcFqFaa	As far as John 9:39 read the following scriptures in this light.  The scripture states where there is no knowledge, sin is not imputed.  Though Jesus stated "HE" came not to judge(after the fashion of men" yet HIS comming set the stage that men could be judge for and in righteousness.  Christ judgement is set for a future time(not long now).  He did say those that believed not were condemned already.  As far as the blind, Jesus was speaking of spiritual sight, not natural.  So those who accepted Christ would/could be able to "see" spiritually whereas the rejectors though highly religious and thought they could see(as they were the purveyers of the law) when rejecting the giver of the law,Jesus, remained in their carnal position and though having a knowlege of the law according to the word, yet remained spiritually blind, not understanding the meaning of the word.  As far as Mark 9, HE was simply warning those and those to followed who would uphold and preach the truth that they also would be rejected and persecuted.  It is written that you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free.  But the truth,Jesus, is diametrically opposed to the carnal thought of man so man makes a choice and most of the time the choice is to keep what the have and reject the truth. In this manner many false religions have arisen.  The gospel must be preacched unto all nations that having been given the truth, they then are subject to judgment as to what they do with it, accept it or reject it.  You see it is also written that "every nation which forgets God, shall be turned into hell.  Other scritptures reveal that the light(Jesus' truth) would go forth into all the world so, as it is written, man is without excuse at the great judgment.  This began to occur with Paul's missionary journeys and continued in mass with the dispora cause by the persecution of believers at Jerusalem and is still happening today in the world  and as in many places the preaching of Christ is banned and the those carrying the message are persecuted and killed.  You perhaps read a few months back how in india two missionaries were killed and burned. These will stand among God's martyrs for as Christ died for what he preached, by the hand of man, so He warned would all that lived G€odly in C€hrist Jesus would be persecuted.  God bless.|`|ywvYFQ0daa	Qs. 1<br>  The coming of Jesus did bring final judgement to the world. People would now be judged based on whether they accepted His message or not. That was part of his purpose.<br>  <br>  However, he had not come to pass character judgements on people, the way the Pharisees had been doing. Their "judgement" was condemning people for simple things. Jesus was not judging people in the same way. He accepts people no matter what. That is still different from him ultimately having to judge everyone at the ressurection.<br>  <br>  Qs. 2<br>  Verse 9 is Jesus warning the disciples that this would happen, and that they should prepare for it. With verse 10, Jesus is summarizing what would happen - first, spreading the gospel, then arrests and trials. After verse 11, Jesus continues to remind them of other consequences that will come - family quarrels and hatred.

Specifically, the symbols of the stars, the moon, and the sun are used in describing the next life (1 Cor. 15: 40-42 and other places). Is it a shock to find the same symbols on some LDS temples, given that the temple is about preparing us for the next life? Further, in Revelation 22:16, Christ refers to himself as "the bright and morning star," and for early Latter-day Saints, the morning star symbol referred to the coming of Christ and His millennial reign - a perfectly appropriate symbol for the temple. For documentation, please see the excellent article by Matthew Brown, "Inverted Stars On LDS Temples," available at <a href="http://www.fairlds.org/pubs/Stars.pdf," rel="nofollow">http://www.fairlds.org/pubs/Stars.pdf,</a> 2002. This article also shows that stars, including inverted stars, were used by early Christians as valid Christian symbols. Inverted stars did not become associated with the occult until after the time of Joseph Smith, as Brown documents. The symbol of the star - whether it has five or six points - and the pentagram can be used for good or evil purposes. The fact that Satan worshippers have given evil meanings to the star, the broken cross, the goat, the moon, or whatever does not make the symbols inherently evil.<br>  <br>  Similarity in symbols does not mean similarity in meaning. The cross-like Ankh symbol was used in pagan rituals of Egypt, but that does not make the symbol of the cross something pagan (though we prefer not to use the cross to remember Christ, wishing to focus on his victory over death through the Resurrection). If I walk into a cathedral and see a cross, it would be silly for me to condemn the Catholics for promoting pagan Egyptian rites with that symbol. The same applies to those who see stars, moons, or suns on the Salt Lake Temple.<br>  <br>  Another helpful resource discussing starts (and also the issue of the name Lucifer for Satan and his connection to stars) is found in the story of René A.

Women should feel honored that they are called by the true God to cover their heads before the Lord. The reason for this is that the hair of their head is their glory and they are thus restricted from manifesting their glory before the Lord. Men, on the other hand, with the exception of the clergy, are strictly prohibited from covering their heads while in the presence of the Lord in the Blessed Sacrament.<br>  <br>  "But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of a woman is her husband, and the head of Christ is God. Any man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head, but any woman who prays or prophesies with her head unveiled dishonors her head—it is the same as if her head were shaven. For if a woman will not veil herself, then she should cut off her hair; but if it is disgraceful for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her wear a veil.<br>      "For a man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man. (For man was not made from woman, but woman from man. Neither was man created for woman, but woman for man.) That is why a woman ought to have a veil on her head, because of the angels....If any one is disposed to be contentious, we recognize no other practice, nor do the churches of God." (1 Corinthians 11:3-10,16) <br>  <br>  When I see muslim women with their heads covered and dressed modestly, it pains me to think of how these women are outside the true Church and yet they behave as should those women who style themselves as Catholics yet adopt every vanity (oftentimes to please men) in immodest dress and unbecoming fashions.<br>  <br>  When I see a muslim woman with a headcovering it only serves to identify to me that this woman and the man with her are grievously in error regarding the true worship of Almighty God--Who is one God in three Divine Persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.|`|Hr2tnZtqaa	You are a strong person and it will take people like you to change these outdated traditions.

This check is far more stringent than even the government mandated health checks and any internal disease that would have killed the animal makes it unkosher even though the meat may be safe to eat.  Halaal does not include the same checks<br>  2) Jews do not eat the hind quarters (if the sdame restriction applies to Halaal my apologies, to the best of my knowledge it does not.)<br>  <br>  Therefore while Muslims can eat kosher meat, Jews cannot eat Halaal meat.<br>  <br>  As for clothing- no, it does not need to be clothing.

fdMKpXCHaa	If you don't have sexual feelings towards her, or any woman, I'd say you're not a lesbian.  You almost sound A-sexual.  That said, I'd say what we have here is a case of infatuation.  Infatuation is the state of being completely carried away by unreasoned passion or love; addictive love. Usually one is inspired with an intense but short-lived passion or admiration for someone.<br>  <br>  Infatuation is a common emotion characterized by unrealistic expectations of blissful passion without positive relationship growth or development.  In the case of infatuation, there is more often than not an obsessor and an object of desire (generally unattainable).<br>  Your case sounds more emotional than sexual.  I hope this helps you understand things better.  Good luck.|`|W545hqrpaa	sounds like a lesbian to me. go girl!!!!!!!!|`|92a39160b5f170df4b5ef1729f3b2395aa	Out of curiosity, what kind of signs has she given you that lead you to believe she is flirting?|`|P2kL3apWaa	Please just breathe. The things you need to know are this :<br>  <br>  Not everyone realizes their sexual orientation when they are young.<br>  <br>  It may be simply a crush.<br>  <br>  Being involved with someone who's married is extremely difficult add to that she is a co-worker and you are setting yourself up for disaster.<br>  <br>  You don't have to figure this out in a day.  Give yourself time to process what you are feeling.  Look back over your life and take an inventory of any other crushes you've had.  Is there anyone this woman reminds you of ?<br>  <br>  It is possible you are a lesbian, but it's also possible you haven't met the right man yet.|`|osj100xeaa	Ok....first of all, I think you're bisexual based on how you described your feelings upon seeing/interacting with her and your past attraction to men. Being bisexual means that one has the capacity to be attracted to persons of both genders....though not necessarily in the same way or to the same degree. You may prefer one gender over the other. There is nothing to be ashamed about. Everyone's experience is different. Some people realise this at a very young age and others, when they are older. <br>  <br>  I don't think your feelings are of adoration or admiration especially since you've been feeling this way for 7 months and u feel butterflies in the tummy and desire intimate affection with her...(tho not sex). But you can be attracted to someone and not desire sex with them initially.<br>  <br>  I think that you'll need to acknowledge these feelings as a normal reaction, as part of who you are and try to deal with any feelings of shame or fear that are bothering you since this is your first crush on another woman. <br>  <br>  What concerns me the most, though, is that these feelings that you have are for someone is married with children. Even if she is bi or gay herself and is interested in you too, she still has a lot to sort out, especially with the responsibility of two young children. Of course, I am not saying that a relationship in the future is not possible for both of you. Just that she would need to take things slowly and deal with them carefully. <br>  <br>  I would suggest that you try to establish a friendship with her at this point. Invite her to hang out if you wish and get to know as a person. During that time, you'll be able to decide if you want a relationship with her....and her kids or not and you should also be able to sense, in that time, if she is also into you. If you sense a mutual interest, then I would suggest that you all have a talk and discuss the best way to handle things as I would not want to encourage cheating on her part.<br>  <br>  Wishing you the best!

tg89r7ZJaa	The world of the 19th century was radically changed by revolutions in America and France. The ideas of democracy and equality rippled throughout the Western world and the colonies of the West. The 20th century began with a revolution in Russia, leading to revolutions in China, Cuba, Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia, a Cold War, and a nuclear arms race that affected every part of the globe. American author John Reed, in Russia during the revolution, called it Ten Days that Shook the World. And though Communism came to an end in 1989, the world is still dealing with the repercussions of the 1917 Communist Revolution. <br>  <br>  It was V.I. Lenin who led the communists in the 1917 revolution. Lenin's given name was Vladimir Ilich Ulyanov and he was the 3rd of 6 children born to a well off family. His path to revolution started when his older brother was executed for plotting to assassinate the czar. Following his brother's execution, Lenin went to study law, but he was expelled after one semester for instigating student protests. Lenin did enroll at another university, where he continued to pursue his law degree and his new passion, radical politics. Lenin was greatly influenced by the book What Is To Be Done,? written by Russian author N. Chernyshevsky in 1863. He also discovered the writings of Karl Marx. By the mid 1890's Lenin had resigned his law practice and decided to pursue revolutionary change in Russian society. His new belief system included the following:<br>  <br>  that the rich abused the poor and that they should help them <br>  that anybody making a profit was abusing everybody else <br>  that everybody was equal <br>  that government should truly represent the people <br>  that the Russian government supported a system that kept the huge majority of Russian people in misery and therefore it should be overthrown <br>  In order to get the Russian people to support the Communist movement, Lenin promised three things. He promised to pull Russia out of the war. He promised to give land to the peasants, something the Provisional Government never did. And lastly, he promised to give control of the factories to the workers and the Soviets. Besides winning over the people, Lenin had several other things to do in order to gain control of Russia. In March 1918, he signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, ending Russia's involvement in World War I and surrendering much of Russia's resources. Lenin then told Trotsky to take 50,000 skilled men into battle. This "Red Army" marched across the countryside attacking what was known as the White Army, an unorganized group with members fighting separately for different causes. <br>  <br>  The Reds fought under the banner of providing everyone with land. The Whites fought to return the country back to the rule of the tsars. The Reds won in 1921. <br>  <br>  The Civil War ruined Russia's economy. During the War, Lenin initiated War Communism. Under this edict, the state seized most factories. All surplus food was taken to the government, which then distributed it among the laborers. No selling, buying, or trading was permitted during this time. Because of this, many farmers and laborers starved. Production went down and all foreign trade ceased. The number of people working was cut in half. A huge percentage (approximately 33 percent) of Russians died. <br>  <br>  Lenin died in 1924. The next powerful leader to arise in Russia was Joseph Stalin. He quickly realized that Russia was behind the western world and would have to modernize to compete on the world stage. The economy was the key. Therefore, he started "Five Year Plans" to increase the economy.|`|ggQLK1Mqaa	Yeah, bc there's like NO information on this anywhere.<br>  <br>  Seriously, try a library.

Plain and simple.<br>  <br>  I question my beliefs at times as I read the Bible.  But that is a personal thing between me and God.  If you attack someone with smug, arrogant statements, whether about religion or any other subject, all people will respond defensively.  <br>  <br>  Jesus slashed the Pharisees, Sadducee's, Scribes and Lawyers and called them blind, serpents, false teachers and went on the offensive against false religion and the puffed up religious leaders - and they were speechless in response to Him - because He spoke the absolute truth and they could not handle it.<br>  <br>  The Bible says to stand boldly for the faith against false teachers and heretical beliefs. It says to be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, for your labor is not in vain in the Lord.<br>  <br>  So this is probably why atheists, agnostics and performance based religions (Catholics, Protestants, Muslims etc.) get put out by the fact that Bible believing Christians will stand their ground on their beliefs and refuse to back down.  They should not be calling other people liars, that is not polite.  They should be kind in expressing their view, but never back down for clearly revealed truth in the Bible.

But yet the Lord tells us in the Bible, that if you are single and cannot  controlled your self because of  our  natural nature, of desires and needs, one is better off getting married and that way you are free from burning in hell , meaning  do not   commit sin's of the flesh  fornication and adultary.        .Obviously not everyone can follow a celibate path. Unificationists in fact recognize that celibacy is not the ideal way of life. Marriage and family are necessary. However, both today and historically, the family has failed to represent the full ideal of spiritual and physical love. Is it possible to unite the spiritual path to God with a fulfilling marriage?....Unificationists argue that we now live in a time when the spiritual potential of the man-woman relationship--lost originally through the Fall--can be realized. Today, for the first time, it is actually through marriage that we can fulfill our highest spiritual potential.<br>  <br>  In contrast to the current low social status of marriage--as evidenced by the existence of prenuptial agreements, "no-fault" divorce laws and widespread cohabitation - the Unificationist approach emphasizes that marriage is an institution of infinite spiritual potential. It is in the love between family members that the love of God can be most fully known. The different experiences of love in the family, as a child, as a spouse, as a parent and finally as a grandparent disclose the diversity, depth and vastness of God's love.

He finished the work His Father sent Him to do, namely carry out the atoning sacrifice for the sins of mankind.<br>  For behold, this is my work and my glory to bring to past the immortality and eternal life of man. Moses 1:39.<br>  He accomplished the first part by conquering death through his resurrection.  He accomplished the second part through his atoning sacrifice making it possible for us to overcome the second death or the spiritual death of being separated from God's presence.  The ultimate loving sacrifice defeats ultimate evil, thus His work was finished in the flesh.  His work will continue in His glorified state until the earth itself is presented in its glorified state after the millenial reign.<br>  Mankind needs His presence and His words, as much or more so now than ever before.  His work nor that of His prophets is not done, but rather his earthly, mortal ministry was done; a limited scope to the interpretation of that statement.|`|97f3e02ea0c61fb5033e4520729f2781aa	The atonement was complete.

More precisely, it was Jesus’ transformation of the Passover sacrifice of the Old Covenant into the Eucharistic sacrifice of the New Covenant. I learned Scripture teaches that the Passover sacrifice of the New Covenant began in the upper room with the institution of the Eucharist, not merely with Jesus being crucified on Calvary, as I was taught and had been teaching. In Jesus’ mind, his Eucharistic sacrifice as the Passover lamb of the New Covenant was not finished until Calvary. In sum, Calvary begins with the Eucharist and the Eucharist ends with Calvary. It is all of one piece.|`|51fe01ef6db0c1bd743afcb3e7a2e1ffaa	Calvary really began in the Old Testament Passover being celebrated in the Upper Room, when the Eucharist was instituted and the Passover Eucharist of the New Covenant really isn't over until Calvary, when He says, "It is finished."|`|dc00e6f724cc094e75dc0475843d0e44aa	It means that the great atonement was completed.

So, perhaps I will believe in the 3 fold law more as I look into this new seed in my psyche, this understanding of some form of cause and effect. . . action and reaction.|`|ZmdIlkpQaa	I certainly believe in the law of returns, but I've been skeptical of whether it's literally threefold or not.  I have seen plenty of examples, over my many years of how what we give out, we get back.  I don't think that the Law of Returns applies only to Witches.  I strongly suspect that it applies to everyone, but some people choose to ignore the idea, and others are simply ingorant of it.  It's a concept which resides in a lot of our underlying culture, in fact.  If you want to be forgiven, you have to forgive.  If you want to be loved, you have to love (yourself first).  Curiously, I have seen a demonstration of a threefold return, but perhaps it only appeared that way to me because I didn't know how manipulaitve and negative this person had been.  I only know that she had been cruel and manipulative and had actually tried to curse my and my two Loves, and she had three rather severe negative events happen to her within a very short span of time, and each seemed directly related to the negative energy who had tried to put on us.<br>  <br>  The result of my experience and belief is that I treat people the way I would want them to treat me, and I try to be helpful and pleasant and cheerful.  Whether I fear a karmic backlash or not, it's a fine rule of thumb for living, and I do find that I reap what I sow.

He may be able to find smeone willing to work with you during the service to help you with the prayers and keeping your place in the documentation (some siddurs, like the one we use at the synagogue I attend, Mishkan Tiffilah, can be a bit confusing to a newcomer).<br>  <br>  BTW: I know you'll be welcomed because I attend synagogue regularly -- despite being an atheist.<br>  <br>  So go, experience, broaden your horizons, and enjoy.|`|DHtCzpNUaa	No you don't.
1lRlNIelaa	As a Greek pagan and with knowledge on our myths I assure you that they are in no way religious texts, declarations of faith or true stories or religious/theological theories. They are plain fictional stories intended to pass a message by portraying that era's most well-known figures, the Gods and heroes. Those of us who believe in those Gods do not believe that Zeus for example, wields a thunderbolt and he'll zap you. We rather believe that he, as a powerful and perfect in human sense, energy entity, powers up the physical laws that cause the storms and thunders. I personally tend to believe that the ancient people, even if they believed in Zeus hurling thunderbolts, they had correctly found his sphere of effect just not in a logical/literal way but a fictional one. Believing in those or any other of the Old Gods is not illogical. In fact I dare say it has more logic than others since pagan religions tend to gracefully unite belief and science. So, in the question what are gods and what they do, we (at least I) pagans answer: they are energy entities of great power responsible for fueling the world's physical "laws". Because science cannot tell us how and what makes the laws going on, our beliefs come and fill that gap. Note that we acknowledge the possibility of being wrong and that Gods may not exist. Though we have our fanatics as well...|`|E5BJ7REzaa	Read the first of the Ten Commandments!

That is why European countries have low teenage pregnancies, whereas the US rate is shameful - they talk about sex and recognise that people are going to have it. Since you can't stop people having sex it may as well be safe sex - or would you rather the unwanted pregnancies ended in abortion?<br>  <br>  If you want to teach abstinence then stop whining about it and go and teach it yourself.

That is all HE is,..now that may seem a little profound.. but in time, I have learned this..even when HE ordered the death of large groups of people, History has shown us that their nature was dangerous, poisoned and sick.. even the animals were killed because of disease..if you had to protect your children from your sick family pets, and death was the only answer , then you would protect your family..GOD sees certain situations this way.. HE sees what we cannot, and we learn to trust HIM and HIS judgement over another choice.. but HE allows us to choose everytime..that is another expression of HIS love..we should not serve HIM out of fear for any reason, but because we trust HIM..<br>  GOD manifested HIS love towards us in that while we were sinners CHRIST Died for us...what does that mean? it means that sin destroys, either us or GOD.. satan could not understand the Plan of Redemption, because it involves sacrifice..when you are the ALMIGHTY, why would YOU have to die? it is a definition of love that is undefinable...but definable, in the Sacrifice that GOD made for us.. and why?? because of LOVE,, the kind that only comes form GOD...|`|r36a0v2laa	God loves everyone just the same!

We believe that they are three seperate and distinct holy, glorified, eternal, immortal beings with the Father and Son having bodies of flesh & bone.  The Holy Ghost being a personage of spirit.<br>  <br>  We do not believe that they are somehow this cloudy united spiritual conglomeration that mankind can't really understand,see, feel, that are without body, parts or passions  which is basically the trinity...<br>  <br>  The God of all that we worship and love is our literal Father in Heaven who loves us and knows us better than anyone else.  We pray to Him through His Son, our Savior & Redeemer, Jesus Christ - who is our friend and Lord.|`|WyICbuPqaa	Classic Trinitarianism is not just that God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost are made of the same essence, but that this essence is non-material.  The closest thing to this "essence" is thought.<br>  <br>  The LDS church rejects the classic view of the Trinity in three ways:<br>  1) They believe that spiritual matter is also matter, just finer.<br>  2) They believe God the Father and Jesus Christ to be spiritual beings with physical bodies.  Their physical bodies are said to be glorified and perfected.<br>  3) The Holy Ghost does not have a physical body, but is a personage of spirit.  The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are three separate beings who are united in purpose.|`|FyLfEPv0aa	82% of Christians believe that in the Trinity God the Father and Jesus Christ are not actually the same person but 2 beings with the Holy Ghost being the 3rd.<br>  <br>  If that's your definition, then yes we agree.<br>  <br>  We refer to that as the "Godhead" (a phrase first used by Paul in Acts) yet as more religions are rejecting the illogical notion of a mysterious God proclaimed by the Dark-age Christians they are aligning themselves with us in a way that while we use differing terminology the definition is identical.|`|3bc6709f9978822792e144f5259dd14baa	About 20% of Christians in the USA are "non trinitarian Christians".  Mormons fall into this group.<br>  <br>  Mormons believe that God, Christ, and the Holy Ghost are all separate beings that are perfectly united in their purpose.  <br>  <br>  The Bible says that Adam and Eve became "one flesh".  Christians don't believe that they literally morphed into one being that was "not one but two and not two but one".  Similarly, Mormons understand the Bible this way regarding the divinity of God. <br>  <br>  Additionally, if Joseph Smith is truthful in his account, we have a first-hand account because he saw them both as two separate beings.  We encourage everyone to pray to God and find out from Him via prayer if this really occurred or if Smith was lying.  <br>  <br>  Generally speaking, Jesus Christ was the one referred to as "God" in the Old Testament.  This has created some of the misunderstanding.  Try reading the Bible with this persepctive and see if it makes more sense or less sense.  <br>  <br>  Imagine someone found a bible, but had never heard of Christianity.  Lets say that they believed it and accepted it to be true.  It's hard to imagine them reading the Bible and interpreting "God" to be the same as "God's son" and vice versa.  It's hard imagine them believing that Christ was praying to himself and pleading with himself.  If it was so "incomprehensible" it seems that the authors of the Bible would have identified God in such a way.|`|0qhRIKpSaa	Mormons read the Bible in John 17 where it describes how Jesus is one with God the Father. They aren't physically one, but they are one in heart and mind. Jesus prays that his followers will be one in the same way that he is one with God.|`|TzY9vkinaa	We believe in the Godhead. The father, son, and the holy ghost are all separate beings.|`|2zgv89OQaa	While Mormonism has historically rejected the doctrine of the Trinity it has in recent times tried to express their own concept of the tritheistic (i.e., three-being) "Godhead" in terms of a "Trinity". This is done by saying that there is a "triunity" in the Godhead. This unity is in their power and purposes, however their unity is not in the same substance or essence of their being (i.e., Trinitarian theology).|`|Kwfo0aRvaa	"With a regard to true theology, a more ignorant people never lived than the present so-called Christian world."<br>  - Prophet Brigham Young, Journal of Discourses 8:199<br>  <br>  "The Christian world, so-called, are heathens as to the knowledge of the salvation of God"<br>  - Prophet Brigham Young, Journal of Discourses 8:171<br>  <br>  "What is it that inspires professors of Christianity generally with a hope of salvation?

They were known respectively as the Church of the Lamb of God and Babylon.

We believe they are separate and distinct beings.  At no time is the Father the Holy Ghost or the Son the Father.  The best description of the trinity I heard was a Lutheran pastor who said he was similtaniously a father, a son and a grandfather depending upon who he was addressing.  One one level that is fine, but going deeper we know that God sacrificed his Son, not himself.  <br>  <br>  Paul wrote that Jesus was the 'express' image of the Father.  The word express in this case means exact.  He was making a very basic point that they are physically alike, as much as any father and son.  <br>  <br>  <br>  1 John 3:1 Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not. <br>    2 Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.|`|q0gRmHlUaa	The problem with the Trinity doctrine is that even mainstream Christians disagree on what the term actually means.  If you're referring to the actual Nicene definition then no, Mormons do not believe in that version of the Trinity doctrine.|`|6DmsiLGbaa	No, we don't, or at least not by the standard definition of the Trinity.

This visually based delusion is closely tied to the good-bad, day-night, either-or delusion. Phenomena are spectral in nature and all life is inextricably connected.<br>  These concepts are intellectually realizable, but overcoming the power of visual input requires mental discipline that is obscured by the clouds of concepts which people use to lead their lives. The mind needs cleaning and training before it is strong enough to overcome visual conditioning. That kind of mental strength and clarity can best be achieved by consistent use of the LDK.<br>  Life Decryption Key<br>  Short Version<br>  By Generalist 02-09<br>  <br>   Life often looks like a secret puzzle or an encrypted message, especially when we are facing problems. We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.<br>  The first is to decide if we want to control our lives, or want to rely on an outside force. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects.<br>  <br>  The question naturally occurs, “What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?”<br>  <br>  Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the Japanese words Myoho.  Why use Japanese words? The concept originated in Japan and can’t be expressed so succinctly in another language.<br>  <br>  Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.<br>  <br>  Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is. <br>  <br>  <br>  The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life and exclude nothing. <br>  <br>  This formulation, used with focused intention, serves as a life decryption key to enable anyone to see the relationships that exist between good concepts and harmful ones<br>  The way to use it is to add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This is spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together to close the energy circle and focuses the mind-brain-body on the essential realities.

AA11297267	I can't tell you why other people answered the way they did -- I'm not a mind reader.<br>  <br>  I suspect part of it would come from your opinion not being supported by most of the scientific community involved in climate research.  For example, you stated that temperature increases CO2 and not the other way around...that hypothesis has been shown to be incorrect (you're right that temperature increases *can* increase free CO2 in the atmosphere, but there's not a direct relation, and it's well established that increases in CO2 *do* increase the temperature.  So your statement was half-right and half-wrong.  It's what you were half right about that has most climate scientists worried -- as the temperature increases FROM human-cause CO2 increases, that *could* cause even more CO2 to be in the atmosphere, creating a runaway greenhouse effect that's self-reinforcing...and that would be very bad.  But it's human-caused CO2 increases that kicks off that whole cycle, so your statement gets wrong the root cause).<br>  <br>  There absolutely *is* good, honest debate in the scientific community about both the cause of global warming and the best way to respond to it (or even IF we need to respond to it).  There's really no longer any debate about whether or not global warming is happening, as you said.  Good honest debate is healthy for science, and often serves to drive more research so that we understand the whole thing better.  I don't think anybody's ideas should be dismissed out-of-hand.  However, you did make several statements that are not supported be evidence or that have strong evidence to show they're wrong...so if you're going to make such statements, you need to back them up to show why they're right.  That's how science works.<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|y2VcJ0t8aa	"...insulted by the answerers...." - welcome to R/S.<br>  <br>  The faithless live to insult others.

On the contrary, it is known as a feedback and a contributor.<br>  <br>  Glad I could help.  At some point alarm is warranted.  There is much growing concern in the science community (not Al Gore or media, but actual scientists in climatology and relevant fields).  I can understand why some alarmism would give people pause.

WHY WON'T THERE BE? with all these increase in green house gases... and it's sad that we are hastening the increase in global temperatures...<br>  <br>  and it's pretty clear with the kind of weather too now... i do not know if changes are noticeable in all parts of the world but here in my place... januaries and februaries and decembers are supposedly just about cold days... weird though that it rains a lot now, it's still cold but 2 or 3 days of rain is usually followed by like 2 days of pure hot sunny days which i do not expect on these cold months... and it is just this year and the december that passed wherein there is frequent raining and then sunny hot days and frequent rains again... weird... climate change for sure...<br>  <br>  and the greater the global temperatures increase, i believe crazier the weather and the climate itself will be!!! with the so much unexpected changes in the weather's status and severity... which can affect vegetation and animals and thereby humans because we are all interconnected in the food chain...<br>  <br>  i have heard about this global warming thing when i was like 5 or 6 but it is just now that i am 21 and had graduated college and doing nothing recently, that i actually see this issue as some BIG DEAL...

They are building it out of defiance of their place or status in the world and want to be as God. This is similar to Ezekiel 28 where Satan (the prince of Tyrus) says that he wants to be like God and leads a rebellion against God. That is what these men did, they are rebelling against God.

And the chief of the nine choirs of angels are fallen. "Of the choir of Seraphim there fell the three first, to wit, Lucifer, Beelzebub and Leviathan, who did all revolt." <br>  <br>      * Beelzebub is the lord of Dark Places, people say that he was the angel of Germs or Plague.<br>  <br>      * Asmodeus is of the same order. He continues as a Seraphim to this day, that is, he burns with the desire to tempt men with his wine of luxuriousness.<br>  <br>      * Samael (Some texts have Samael as Satan's true angelic name instead of Lucifer)<br>  <br>      * Semyazza was the leader of the fallen Grigori (meaning "Watchers" in Greek).

He tempts men with idleness and sloth.<br>  <br>      * Verrine is also one of the Thrones and is next in place after Astaroth. He tempts men with impatience.<br>  <br>      * Gressil is the third in the order of Thrones.

Not really wrong, but very definitely rude.<br>  <br>  I dont recall any of the 10 Commandments (which are OT anyway) saying that thou shalt not criticise or deny god - unless it is in the context of worshipping a different deity or taking gods name in vain. But then these are the ten commandments which modern Christians have modified to suit their own ends anyway.<br>  <br>  Theists regularly openly condemn atheists for their lack of belief - atheism is not a belief structure, is the absence of belief in a deity.<br>  <br>  Christianity and Islam have a doctrine that encourages the faithful to ensure there is only one belief system. Judaism and Monotheistic Hinduism are somewhat more tolerant - although Thor only knows why.<br>  <br>  The secular democracies of the world today have largely been founded on enlightenment values and have established (written or otherwise) codes that restrict governmental imposition of one religion over others. This is what generally means freedom of religion - it is not the prohibition of any particular religion.<br>  <br>  Scripture rarely supports a rational argument, unless the argument is about what a particular translation actually says.|`|QC7vlfPPaa	Ridicule, but don't slander.

(this even could be more).<br>  <br>  So my advice to you is to make sure and be good and loving and faithful so that you attain the highest degrees in Paradise so yo can get what ever is in your mind. (if you attain the highest understanding as an educated person knowing what you want then it will be seeing God in Paradise more than one time and you will have no time to think about anything else) but if you are a faithful with a simple minded then you count how many virgins yo would wish to have, that is ok.|`|dPJr1Lbmaa	Why do you seem hell bend on showing your ignorance continuously?<br>  Silly boy!

The next day came news of the mass suicide of members of the Peoples Temple. Horror came in degrees as San Franciscans learned more than 400 Jonestown residents were dead.[110] Dan White remarked to two aides who were working for his reinstatement, "You see that?

Witnesses heard shouting between White and Moscone, then gunshots. White shot the mayor once in the arm, then three times in the head after Moscone had fallen on the floor.[114] White then quickly walked to his former office, reloading his police-issue revolver with hollow-point bullets along the way, and intercepted Harvey Milk, asking him to step inside for a moment. Dianne Feinstein heard gunshots and called the police. She found Milk face down on the floor, shot five times, including twice in the head at close range. Feinstein was shaking so badly she required support from the police chief after identifying both bodies.[113][note 8] It was she who announced to the press, "Today San Francisco has experienced a double tragedy of immense proportions.

Their numbers were estimated between 25,000 and 40,000, spanning the width of Market Street, extending the mile and a half (2.4 km) from Castro Street.

They have been written, according to tradition, respectively by Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. They are placed at the beginning of the New Testament and comprise close to half of it. <br>  <br>  Encyclopedia Britannica notes that none of the sources of his life and work can be traced to Jesus himself; he did not leave a single known written word. Also, there are no contemporary accounts written of his life and death. What can be established about the historical Jesus depends almost without exception on Christian traditions, especially on the material used in the composition of the Gospels of Mark, Matthew, and Luke, which reflect the outlook of the later church and its faith in Jesus.<br>  <br>  Educate yourself on anything you use in guidance of your life.

VxozKUcCaa	Most mythologies are trying to explain our own existence (life, death, rebirth <if any> and our purpose while we are here.)  The underworld(s) in mythology is to explain what happens to us after death and why.  It is all part of the attempt to explain the grand scheme of things and what we are to do with our time here and how we should conduct our lives while we are here.
D6gY17qeaa	This is completely false; the reason the Maya noted 12/21/12 was not to mark the end of times; This date actually markes two things; It markes an end to a cycle which is related to a cycle that occurs in space; It markes the time when our solar system will align with our Galactic Plane. <br>  <br>  This cycle is constant and we move threw the plane every few thousand years or so. Remember that the Maya where the best astrologers in history until modern times, and thier calander is based strickly on astrological movements and events. However this date is incorrect because according to astrologers, we have already moved through the Galactic Plane with no incident. Many people feared that this would cause unstable conditions in our solar system or even earth. Some scientist believed that passing threw the galactic plane would cause our axis to shift or maybe cause asteroids or comets to become unstable and make their way to earth.<br>  <br>  Don't believe all those books and websites, they'ree only trying to sell books to people who have nothing better to do.|`|motz4Y14aa	Are you thinking you are going to live eternally?<br>  <br>  Every one is going to get his end of days, aka, DEATH<br>  <br>  Some get it by the trigger, some by cancer, meteor, exam results. . . .|`|6yiBCu7Eaa	it's ridiculous.<br>  honestly, there's always a new "end of the earth" date, and life always goes on.|`|d9e9d3a2969f4661e295d7b587567511aa	"it's the end of the world as we know it.." great you got me singing this song now. thanks.|`|CPObbqfsaa	No its just a completed cycle. dec 22 will be the beginning of the next cycle.

Astronomically this day is significant as well, as our solar system's planets are supposed to align. I think many people find this as either a hopeful or fearful time, depending on their beliefs. Personally, as someone who doesn't subscribe to organized religion but believes there are forces out there, I expect to see some radical changes. If you look at how unsustainable western lifestyle is, the increasing resistance of antibiotics, pollution, species extinction, nuclear proliferation, ect.. There are plenty of opportunities for a massive change that would affect the way everyone on this earth exists.<br>  Personally, I embrace it, because I think the way we live now is pretty short-sighted.|`|LuN1unJ3aa	It just the end (or as close as we can figure) to the long count Mayan calendar.

If people actually took the time to study the Mayan beliefs the would realize that they Mayan didn't believe that the end of the earth would occur on this date, just the end of our current cycle.  The Mayans believed that the earth has passed through several cosmic cycles and this date just marks the end of one of these cycles.  If the Mayans actually believed that the world would end on this date than why did they create symbols to represent dates which will occur after Dec 21, 2012.  The only reason the Mayan calendar abruptly ends on this date is because it is the end of a cycle.  This cycles end was so far in the future for them that they saw no need to start another calendar.|`|RhDPB70Baa	It means there's going to be a party at my house, and likely many other places.

A minimum of 5-6 years and also one year in Israel, especially to develop a relationship with Israel and familiarity with Hebrew as a living language<br>  <br>  5. Graduation or ordination is essentially the same kind of ceremony with various kinds of certification or diplomas. <br>  <br>  6. Some Seminaries or yeshivot also require an internship to gain some practical experience<br>  <br>  7. Some movements require a new graduate to start with a small congregation in order to learn all of the various elements of congregational or institutional life before moving up to a large congregation, UNLESS one takes an assistant position in a larger congregation which is much more narrow in function.<br>  <br>  If you are interested in any particular movement or ordination, please write them for their details.|`|V2Rl90PEaa	You go to school to become a Rabbi(a Rabbinical College).

NQ37mnWkaa	Easter is basically a Christianisation of the Pagan celebrations of Ostera. The origins can still be seen in many ways, such as Easter Bunnies and Easter Eggs ~ it was a fertility festival, and rabbits / hares were sacred to the Goddess Ostera. <br>  <br>  The date of Easter Sunday is always set in the following way :<br>  First Sunday after the first full moon after the Spring Equinox. <br>  <br>  This is why it moves ~ though the Spring Equinox is always the same, it all depends on when the full moon falls...|`|0vmQNf0oaa	It does not.

Just look in the bibleJohn 3 (New International Version)<br>  <br>  John 3<br>  Jesus Teaches Nicodemus <br>   1Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish ruling council. 2He came to Jesus at night and said, "Rabbi, we know you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the miraculous signs you are doing if God were not with him." <br>   3In reply Jesus declared, "I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again.[a]" <br>  <br>   4"How can a man be born when he is old?" Nicodemus asked. "Surely he cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb to be born!" <br>  <br>   5Jesus answered, "I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit. 6Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit[b] gives birth to spirit. 7You should not be surprised at my saying, 'You[c] must be born again.' 8The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit." <br>  <br>   9"How can this be?" Nicodemus asked. <br>  <br>   10"You are Israel's teacher," said Jesus, "and do you not understand these things? 11I tell you the truth, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony. 12I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things? 13No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven—the Son of Man.[d] 14Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, 15that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.[e] <br>  <br>   16"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,[f] that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 17For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. 18Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son.[g] 19This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. 20Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. 21But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through God."[h]<br>  <br>  John the Baptist's Testimony About Jesus <br>   22After this, Jesus and his disciples went out into the Judean countryside, where he spent some time with them, and baptized. 23Now John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water, and people were constantly coming to be baptized. 24(This was before John was put in prison.) 25An argument developed between some of John's disciples and a certain Jew[i] over the matter of ceremonial washing. 26They came to John and said to him, "Rabbi, that man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan—the one you testified about—well, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him." <br>   27To this John replied, "A man can receive only what is given him from heaven. 28You yourselves can testify that I said, 'I am not the Christ[j] but am sent ahead of him.' 29The bride belongs to the bridegroom.

To do so, seems rather arrogant and misguided to me.<br>  <br>  As a Christian, I believe that I have a right-standing with God only through faith in Christ.  There was no way that I could hope to earn God's favor...what could I possibly do?    The gospel message is that eternal life is a gift from God, through Jesus....by faith in Christ, a person is able to KNOW that they will be saved.  <br>  <br>  Who is going to hell (i.e.- an existence/separation from God)?  Those who willfully reject the gospel message and treat God's grace with contempt.<br>  <br>  In between the two above extremes, there are a lot of people who have not heard the message...do not understand it...or whatever.  What is their eternal fate?  That is between the individual and their Creator, and only God knows.<br>  <br>  God has created us with a free will. In that sense, he has no "forced expectations" for your life. You are totally free to chose your own path. However, God has called for you to seek after him in love and faith. Faith is simply a response to God's love. What does God want you to do in this life?

UmjJmYsjaa	The year 2012 comes from the Mayan Calander which ends exactly in December 12 2012. I've been reading on it and some archeologist think that the Olmec were the ones to originally come up with the Calendar because of the of the numerical writing on the calendar. (they look like dots and slashes)<br>  <br>  The Aztecs had the thought that we lived in a cycle and at the end of each cycle destruction would arise. We are currently in the 5th Cycle, according to them, i forgot the name of it. But thier mythology is weird, hard to follow, and thanks to the Catholic Church for burning Aztec writing after Columbus, because Archeologist have little to go by except a book called Codex Chimalpopoca, Popul Vuh and others.<br>  <br>  Funny thing is that i read an answer somebody gave for this. If they could predict the end of the cycle, or end of the world, Why couldn't they predict thier own destruction or end of civilization?<br>  <br>  If you're Christian this will help:<br>  <br>  (Matthew 24:36) “Concerning that day and hour nobody knows, neither the angels of the heavens nor the Son, but only the Father.<br>  <br>  That day and hour, when you read Matthew 24: 3 you'll know that they are talking about Armaggedon, - "While he was sitting upon the Mount of Olives, the disciples approached him privately, saying: “Tell us, When will these things be, and what will be the sign of your presence and of the conclusion of the system of things?”<br>  <br>  Nobody knows not even Jesus himself, only God.<br>  I hope that helps :D|`|yj3GT7jOaa	It will be intensely dark followed with small indications of illumination growing intensely brighter until you will be able to see without a flashlight.

The Mayan calendar ends in the year 2012... Many people have taken that to mean that due to the accuracy of the Mayan predictions that the world will end on Dec. 12, 2012. Some in the scientific community have brought out that in that year the Sun of our solar system lines up with the center of the Milky Way and that they believe this will cause some events here on earth.<br>  As for myself I dont buy any of it, I am a Christian and believe Gods word in that only the Father knows the day of the end of days.

Drosnin also states in his book that the Bible code only predicts possibilities.<br>      * The 2006 book 2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl by Daniel Pinchbeck discusses theories of a possible global awakening to psychic connection by the year 2012, creating a noosphere.<br>      * Riley Martin asserts that Biaviian aliens will allow passage aboard their 'Great Mother Ship' when the Earth is 'transformed' in 2012.<br>      * Terence McKenna's numerological novelty theory suggests a point of singularity in which humankind will go through a great shift in consciousness.<br>      * Dannion Brinkley, in his 2007 book, Secrets of the Light, a follow-up to his 1995 bestseller Saved by the Light, predicts "that by the year 2012 humanity will experience unprecedented mental and spiritual transformations, coinciding precisely with the Earth's passage through great physical upheaval" (Brinkley 96).[25]|`|sWvbwfLPaa	Most likely it is related to one of these event:<br>  <br>  1.

NrjGBiV2aa	It should be read imaginatively|`|wB3AbJyLaa	Christians who accept the Bible's authority agree that the primary goal of Biblical interpretation is to be understood by his audience. This has always meant interpreting a text according to its literary genre. For example, when Christians read Palms they read it as poetry. When they read Luke, which claims to be an eyewitness account, they take it as history. See Luke 1:1-4. Any reader can see the the poetic imagery is to be read as metaphorical. The difficulty comes in the few places in the Bible where genre is not easily identifiable, and we aren't completely sure how the author expects it to be read. Genesis 1 is a passage whose interpretation is up for debate among Christians, even those with a high view of Scripture. I personally take the view that Genesis 1 and 3 relate to each other the way Judges 4 and 5 and Exodus 14 and 15 do. In each couplet one chapter describes a historical event and the other is a song or poem about the theological meaning of the event. When reading Judges 4 it is obvious that it is a sober recounting of what happened in the battle, but when we read Judges 5, Deborah's Song about the battle, the language is poetic metaphorical. When Deborah sings that the stars in the heavens came down to fight for the Israelites, we understand that she means that metaphorically. I think Genesis 1 has the earmarks of poetry and therefore a song about the wonder and meaning of God's creation. Genesis 2 is an account of how it happened. There will always be debates about how to interpret some passages, including Genesis 1. But it is false logic to argue that if one part of Scripture can't be taken literally then none of it can be. That isn't true of any human communication.|`|BDSC8R3Aaa	No, bubbles. The Bible should be read with the explanation of a priest well versed in its knowledge.

Generally, every living creature prefers to be alive than dead. So each creature (and species) does whatever it needs, to survive. The human species is exceptional, in that way. It is the most self-destructive. When any other species acquires additional space and food, its population increases and conflict within the population decreases. When people acquire additional space and food, they try to acquire even more until they reach a point where someone will kill them for space and food that they cannot use. To prevent that from happening, people try to kill as many "enemies" as they can before the enemies kill them. So, in the case of human populations, acquiring greater resources for survival is the direct cause of the death of greater numbers than would have been possible with fewer survival needs being met. Either way you look at it, human beings tend to be self-destructive -- either they destroy themselves when they have enough or they die because they do not have enough.|`|rJ8kLGgkaa	As any biologist can tell you, we are not the most valuable.

The only thing that makes humans dominant is that we can determine consciously what species or group of humans will live, and which will die.  In order to keep the peace between humans, we have given humans clearly defined limits about what they can do, what property is "theirs," etc.  <br>  <br>  Some humans have tried to give property rights to animals, by establishing wilderness areas, wetlands, etc.  But these set asides are always being challenged by other humans who want to make money off the area.

wB3AbJyLaa	It is legitimate, though, to ask: How can we know the Bible is divinely inspired? The Bible declares that it is the Word of god, His communication to humanity, so He certainly would give us evidence that it truly is His Word. The fulfilled prophecies, the amazing consistency, and the many scientific statements of the Bible provide evidence that it is supernatural origin. We will look at some examples, and then we'll consider what it is gives even more credibility to the reality of God and the inspiration of the Scriptures. Unlike other books, the Bible offers a multitude of specific predictions, some thousands of years in advance, that either have been literally fulfilled or point to a define future time when they will come true. No other religion has specific, repeated, and unfailing fulfillment of predictions many years in advance of events over which the predictor had no control. The sacred writings of Buddhism, Islam, Confucius, and so on are all missing the element of proven prophecy. These kinds of predictions are unique to the Bible. Only one who is omniscient can accurately predict details of events thousands of years in the future. Limited human beings know that the Scriptures have a divine Author: "For I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like me, declaring the end from the beginning, and from the ancient times things that are not yet done." Isaiah 46:9,10. In addition, the Bible declares that prophets must be one hundred percent accurate, no exceptions. If anyone claimed to be speaking for God and prophesied event didn't come to pass, he was proven to be a lair. The writings of Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses are littered with false prophecies, so we know can whether they are written by men or by God. The Bible's sixty-six books, written between 1400 B.C. and A.D. 90, contain approximately 3,856 verses concerned with prophesy. For example, the Scriptures predicted the rise and fall of great empires like Greece an Rome in Daniel 2:39-40, and foretold the destruction of cities like Tyre and Sidon in Isaiah 23. Tyre's demise is recorded by ancient historians, who tell how Alexander the Great lay siege to the city for seven months. King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had failed a thirteen-year attempt to capture the seacoast city and completely destroy its inhabitants. During the siege of 573 B.C., much of the population of Tyre moved to its new island home half a mile from the land city. Here it remained surrounded by walls as high as one-hundred-fifty feet until judgment fell in 332 B.C. with the arrival of Alexander the Great. In the seven-month siege, he fulfilled the remainder of the prophecies in Zechariah 9:4 and Ezekiel 26:12 concerning the city at sea by destroying Tyre, killing eight-thousand of its inhabitants and selling thirty-thousand of its population into slavery. To reach island, he scraped up the dust and rubble of the old land city of Tyre, just as the Bible predicted, and cast them into the sea, building a two-hundred-foot-wide causeway out to the island.<br>  <br>  Following are a few examples of incredible scientific facts that were written in the Bible, hundreds, even thousands of years before man discovered them. At a time when it was commonly believed that the earth sat on a large animal or a giant estimated around 1500 B.C., the Bible spoke of the earths free float in space: "He hangs on the earth on nothing" in Job 26:7. Science didn't discover that the earth hangs on nothing until 1650. The Scriptures tell us that the earth is round: "It is He who sits above the circle of the earth" in Isaiah 40:22. The word translated circle here is Hebrew word chuwg, which is also translated circuit or compass depending on the context. That is, it indicates something spherical or rounded, not flat or square. The Book of Isaiah was written between 740 and 680 B.C. This is at least three-hundred years before Aristotle suggested, in his book "On the Heavens," that the earth might be a sphere. It was another two-thousand years later, at the time when science believed that the earth was flat, that the Scriptures inspired Christopher Columbus to sail around the world. Matthew Maury, whom lived from 1806 to 1873, is considered the father of oceanography. He noticed the expression paths of the seas in Psalm 8:8, written two-thousand-eight-hundred years ago, and stated, "If God said there are paths in the sea, I am going to find them." Maury then took God at His word and went looking for these paths, and we are indebted to him for his discovery of the warm and cold continental currents. His book on oceanography remains a basic text on the subject and is still used in universities. Only recent years has science discovered that everything we see is composed of things that we cannot see, invisible atoms. In Hebrews 11:3, written two-thousand years ago, Scripture tells us that the things which are seen were not made of things which are visible.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	It's not an argument, it's an experience.

But so few people want to see what is right there in plain sight.|`|Rn4GXoJAaa	Here are 14 reasons I came up with when I was debating the LDS missionaries:<br>  <br>  2.1.1. Verified By History/Archeology<br>  2.1.1.1. Abraham’s home city of Ur was excavated by Sir Leonard Woolley.<br>  2.1.1.2. Solomonic cities such as Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer have been excavated.<br>  2.1.1.3. Isaiah 20:1 was challenged by critics because they knew of no king named Sargon in lists of Assyrian kings. Now Sargon’s palace has been recovered at Khorsabad, including a wall inscription and a library record endorsing the battle against the Philistine city of Ashdod.<br>  2.1.2. Verified By Fulfilled Prophesies<br>  2.1.2.1. In Zechariah 8:7-8, the prophet said God would bring the Jews from exile back to their homeland (Israel) and that they would be able to live in the city of Jerusalem again. This prophecy has been fulfilled more than once. About 2600 years ago, Babylon destroyed Jerusalem and took many Jews as captives to Babylon. But many Jews later returned from Babylon. The Jews rebuilt Jerusalem but the city was destroyed about 1900 years ago by the Romans. The Romans killed more than 1 million Jews and forced many more into exile. And, the Romans banned Jews from living in Jerusalem. More than 1800 years passed before the Jews had control of Jerusalem again. They reclaimed control of their ancient capital during the Six Day War of 1967.<br>  2.1.2.2. Daniel 9:25: Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times. This includes a mathematical prophecy. As we have noted in previous articles, the Jewish (and Babylonian) calendars used a 360-day year; 69 weeks of 360-day years totals 173,880 days. In effect, Gabriel told Daniel that the interval between the commandment to rebuild Jerusalem until the presentation of the Messiah as King would be 173,880 days. The commandment to restore and build Jerusalem was given by Artaxerxes Longimanus on March 14, 445 B.C. Jesus entered Jerusalem on April 6, 32 A.D. When we examine the period between March 14, 445 B.C. and April 6, 32 A.D., and correct for leap years, we discover that it is 173,880 days exactly, to the very day!<br>  2.1.2.3. In Isaiah 45:1, the prophet said God would open the gates of Babylon for Cyrus and his attacking army. Despite Babylon's remarkable defenses, which included moats, and walls that were more than 70-feet thick and 300-feet high, and 250 watchtowers, Cyrus was able to enter the city and conquer it. Cyrus and his troops diverted the flow of the Euphrates River into a large lake basin. Cyrus then was able to march his army across the riverbed and into the city.<br>  2.1.3. Verified By Its Unique Structure And Unity<br>  2.1.3.1. Although the Bible is composed of 66 books, it contains no contradictions or internal conflicts.<br>  2.1.4. Verified By Its Endurance Against Attacks<br>  2.1.4.1. The Scriptures have been attacked by various groups and nations all through history. It continues to be attacked today. The question is, “Why are people so afraid of the Bible?”<br>  2.1.5. Verified By Changes Lives<br>  2.1.5.1. The Scriptures have changed countless lives, past and present. Countless men and women have died for their unwavering convictions of what it says.<br>  2.1.6. Verified By Jesus Christ On Every Page<br>  2.1.6.1. Throughout the Old Testament, Jesus Christ can be found boldly displayed on every single page. For example, in Genesis, Joseph foreshadows Jesus Christ in over 100 different ways.<br>  2.1.7. Verified By Its Scientific Accuracy<br>  2.1.7.1. Dinosaurs are referred to in several Bible books. The book of Job describes two dinosaurs. One is described in chapter 40 starting at verse 15, and the other in chapter 41 starting at verse 1.<br>  2.1.7.2. 1Corinthians 15:41 says that stars differ from stars in glory. All stars look alike to the naked eye. Even when seen through a telescope, they seem to be just points of light. However, analysis of their light spectra reveals that each is unique and different from all others.<br>  2.1.7.3. Job 26:7 describes the suspension of the Earth in space.<br>  2.1.8. Verified By The Accuracy Of Manuscripts<br>  2.1.8.1. Ignoring spelling-oriented (orthographic) changes and similar small differences, the Dead Sea Scrolls match the Hebrew text behind today’s Old Testament, in spite of the passage of over 2,000 years (where one would expect errors to creep in).<br>  2.1.8.2. The New Testament’s earliest manuscripts date from 25-50 years after composition, and there are about 5700 extant manuscripts. Compare this with Thucydides, which only has 20 known manuscripts, the earliest of which is 1300 years removed from the original. Or Homer’s Iliad, 500 years removed from the original.

History documents their fulfillment. (Isaiah 13:19, 20; Daniel 8:3-8, 20-22; Micah 5:2) Although not a science textbook, the Bible is scientifically accurate. It contains facts about nature and health that were written thousands of years before scientists were able to reach similar conclusions.—Leviticus 11:27, 28, 32, 33; Isaiah 40:22.<br>  <br>  <br>  Jehovah God is the Creator. (Revelation 4:11) He is without beginning or end, and he is almighty. (Psalm 90:2) Jesus, on the other hand, had a beginning. (Colossians 1:15, 16) Referring to God as his Father, Jesus said: “The Father is greater than I am.” (John 14:28) Jesus also explained that there were some things neither he nor the angels knew but that were known only by his Father.—Mark 13:32.<br>  <br>  Moreover, Jesus prayed to his Father: “Let, not my will, but yours take place.” (Luke 22:42) To whom was Jesus praying if not to a superior Personage? Furthermore, it was God who resurrected Jesus from the dead, not Jesus himself. (Acts 2:32) Obviously, the Father and the Son were not equal before Jesus came to the earth or during his earthly life. What about after Jesus’ resurrection to heaven? First Corinthians 11:3 states: “The head of the Christ is God.” In fact, the Son will always be in subjection to God. (1 Corinthians 15:28) The Scriptures therefore show that Jesus is not God Almighty. Instead, he is God’s Son.<br>  <br>  The so-called third person of the Trinity—the holy spirit—is not a person. Addressing God in prayer, the psalmist said: “If you send forth your spirit, they are created.” (Psalm 104:30) This spirit is not God himself; it is an active force that he sends forth or uses to accomplish whatever he wishes. By means of it, God created the physical heavens, the earth, and all living things. (Genesis 1:2; Psalm 33:6) God used his holy spirit to inspire the men who wrote the Bible. (2 Peter 1:20, 21) The Trinity, then, is not a Scriptural teaching.* “Jehovah our God is one Jehovah,” says the Bible.—Deuteronomy 6:4.|`|zAfKvhW4aa	Education is a must before you choose your path of guidance:<br>  <br>  Source of information about Jesus in Christianity<br>  <br>  Christians take their information about Jesus from the Bible, which includes the Old and New Testaments.<br>  <br>  These contain four biblical narratives covering the life and death of Jesus. They have been written, according to tradition, respectively by Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. They are placed at the beginning of the New Testament and comprise close to half of it. <br>  <br>  ENCYCLOPEDIA BRITANNICA<br>  notes that none of the sources of his life and work can be traced to Jesus himself; he did not leave a single known written word. Also, there are no contemporary accounts written of his life and death. What can be established about the historical Jesus depends almost without exception on Christian traditions, especially on the material used in the composition of the Gospels of Mark, Matthew, and Luke, which reflect the outlook of the later church and its faith in Jesus.|`|R8yiNPfzaa	You cannot claim the bible is true as whole. Everyone knows that the bible consists of bits and pieces gathered from the Jews as well as new texts that were written after Jesus time. Think of the bible like this, if I took a scientific book with true proven information, and I copy it and I included as chapters in my book and I added other information that is totally wrong or have no scientific basis, then I cam to you and said, look my entire book is true coz it contains so many “fact” and “proven science” in it, would you believe me? Would the "true" prophecies that contained in the bible prove the entire bible was inspired by GOD?  No I don’t think so. <br>  <br>  What you have in the current bible are some truly inspired words of GOD copied through the Jews prophets such as Moses and so on,  you also have some true teachings of Jesus through his disciples, you also have the man manipulated parts from the Jews (and others) to make the bible say what they wanted to say, such as justifying wars and killing of women and children, and it also contains totally man words who presented their own thoughts as it was GOD words such as "saint" Paul who said he was inspired by the “Holy Spirit” and he wrote punch of stuff for you, like:  1 Timothy 2:11-12:<br>  "11 A woman must quietly receive instruction with entire submissiveness. 12 But I do not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man, but to remain quiet.” As if GOD the creator do not know that in the future there will be many female teachers who not only teach, but do great job in teaching (AA).  Most of the Christian Doctrine is attributed to "Saint" Paul some way or another coz almost all the other books in the New Testament was influenced by his writings (He was the first to write and was very active it passing his thoughts everywhere, and surely he had many followers who believed him). I believe many of the bible words were inspired by GOD, but what you have today as the bible is not pure words of GOD and definitely this current bible is not what Jesus taught to his disciples as a whole, it may contains some traces but not every teaching in the bible is true teaching of GOD. Sure since the bible contains some words of GOD we would expect it would contain true prophecies and some scientific fact, but the true test is that if it was totally words of GOD it should not contain errors or manmade words. The same test is valid for my imaginary “scientific book”, it may contains some fact, but if there is a single proven mistake, then my entire book is not true as scientific book.So which part of Christian doctrine is based on “true GOD word” and which part is based on manmade words, you figure it for yourself or you can ask Bart Ehrman for help. Peace.

Perhaps such a woman could work as a meter-maid, or dispatcher, or clerk but she would not deserve to be called a peace officer.

Before entering your apartment whenever you comes home, tap your head against the door 3 times, and click your teeth while turning the knob 5 times then you may enter and that scares all the bad spirits or ghosts away.  If you want good luck with money, keep a sack of pennies beside every trashed can in your apartment and this will bring you much luck with money, if you want loves place an inflated condom on top of your refrigerator, this will absorbe the vibes of love and bring you more love than youve ever dreamed.. good luck with your superstitions!|`|0XR15Dbuaa	Play lots of Elvis' music when you first move in.

While everything is energy, this is an affect of God's laws, not God, in that since. What is within refers to the fact that the Higher Realms or Kingdoms are accessed within oneself, that at every one we have a Indwelling reality of our Being that dwells at that level. It is only spoken as "within" because that is the only means by which one can travel there, through the portal/channel that has been further developed, which connects that level to our level. <br>  <br>  People pass through a tunnel to enter the reality of their Higher Soul Self, which is a Being of Light and the mind of God is at the core of our being. Onions have layers, this is how this is but much more, we have a cosmology of Being. Anyone that has been drawn into Higher Being they know these things.

I see the Mercy of God clearly in the Old testament, He gives a promise of Hope in Christ, He shows authority like a Father that loves his children as ones that don't don't!<br>  He saves and directs his people to goodness teaches how a person should live and act, Of course some kids just see the hand, but never understand what's behind it. It's always LOVE.|`|AA11723247	God had every justifiable right to send Adam and Eve to Hell for eternity...end of story.  But rather than show His face to Adam and Eve after the original sin, which would have resulted in their death, His voice moved through the Garden.  Rather than send them to Hell, He sent them out of the Garden, and even killed an animal, thereby giving Adam and Eve clothing made of fur.<br>  <br>  Moving further...Moses payed to God to walk with Him into the Promised Land, but God declined.  God said that if I went with you, you would surely die.<br>  <br>  This is all about love.  The Bible is a love story between God and man.  Everything in the OT points to Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  What you see in the OT is love and the justice of God.

UmjJmYsjaa	Actually no. There are alot of people that get the bible but are not Christians. There are alot of Scholars that dedicate themselves to study ancient manuscripts but they themselves are not relgious.<br>  <br>  Some Christians will say no, that you have to be one. but how many Christians follow the bible? How many self proclaimed christians ignore Acts 15:20?<br>  <br>  (Acts 15:20) but to write them to abstain from things polluted by idols and from fornication and from what is strangled and from blood.<br>  <br>  Idols - The Cross, Virgen Mary Statue<br>  Fornication - I dont even have to give an example for this one<br>  and how do Christians abstain from what is strangled and from blood? They dont and just completely ignore this bible passage. Dont listen to Christians.<br>  <br>  If you want to understand the bible the Study it. I can give you some Pointers one where to Start, and i encourage you to use different bible versions.

I would much prefer someone with an open mind to read and study the bible, before drawing conclusions.

Mind you, that's what made me leave the church...|`|Z03nSGhEaa	Can you truly understand the Bible, yet not be a Christian? Well, I've got an idea: Lets see what the Bible really says & means concerning that:<br>  <br>  2 Peter 1:20 <br>  Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.<br>  <br>  Ok, so what does this really mean? <br>  A.) Every time an individual tries to read & understand the Scripture they will fail??? (Because it is done in private) ???<br>  Or perhaps<br>  B.) Any group of people who get together to understand Scripture can??? (Because it is not done in private... perhaps if the group is large enough)???<br>  These answers are foolish so far... So then what does it really mean, if we are to really understand it, then we must understand what is truly meant by the writer... let's keep trying:<br>  Perhaps it means:<br>  C.) Perhaps people who call themselves Christians who get together can understand the Bible every time??? <br>  As you can see, this one verse can have a lot of different meanings & can be twisted, or misunderstood (Even by those professing to be Christian... Even by true Christians, if they interpret it presumptuously based on what seems to sound fitting & good... because people can be presumptuous. <br>  <br>  Ok, so what does the author really mean by this verse:<br>  <br>  2 Peter 1:20 <br>  Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.<br>  <br>  How was it intended & how was it written?<br>  <br>  2 Peter 1:21 <br>  Because the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.<br>  <br>  When Peter wrote this, he did not write it "privately" (by the will of man) <br>  Peter wrote it being moved by the Holy Ghost... & he intends it to not be read privately (by the will of man)<br>  He is telling the reader that it is to be interpreted by the Holy Ghost who knows the true meaning & intention of what was written... Which he says is the only way to truly understand certain things, telling the reader there is no other way to interpret these things. <br>  <br>  So, I'd say unless you can truly understand that first, then you can't truly understand or interpret the rest of Scriptures either.<br>  <br>  So This is what the Bible says... Hopefully we can truly understand this at least.|`|ac7a16ae718a21dd251655a703176688aa	No.<br>  Churches are filled with people who do not understand or comprehend the Bible yet have some form of belief.<br>  So HOW could a non-Believer?<br>  <br>  To your additional details,<br>  No there is no short-cut to a Life in Christ and His revelations, so why not get on that narrow road with us, when your heart is ready and you are truely sorry for sinning against God... and God alone?|`|8rbQBaIeaa	That's funny. The thing is, I wish there was a decoding method....The bible is so hard to not only understand, but to interpret. This is why I go to Church, the Pastor has the training to "decode". I don't know. It sounds as if you aren't interested in Religion, so I'm not sure how you could unless you bought some books or got online to the sites that explain it better...Good Luck and God Bless|`|y2VcJ0t8aa	I do not think it is possible.<br>  <br>  The Bible is intended for believers, if you want to call it a secret decoder ring, go for it.

The Bible is a map to that path. You may understand that map and even follow it. However, you may choose to name the path something else. You may decide, also, that having truly understood the map and where it leads, you choose not to go there or even to the path that leads there. And, of course, you may understand the path, follow it, and you may also choose to believe that re-naming the path is the same as destroying the path. Whatever choices you make, most people will disagree with most of your choices most of the time.|`|t8JlnuqFaa	No|`|AypSdbwzaa	There are some keys that help unlock some of what the bible has to say.  The bible actually tells people what its symbolism means, if they are paying attention.  The trick is whenever you come across certain words, you substitute the key word and you get a deeper understanding to what the bible means.  Only a small percentage of christians have ever tried this, hence, much confusion about what the bible means.<br>  <br>  However, it takes years of study to find these key words.  I have a list with over 900 entries, I could e-mail it to you if you wish.|`|92373c108e6ba225edeef58fe8d9e131aa	I understand your frustration. Christians in general love that line of argument because there's no way around it. Yes Im an atheist and yes I believe the bible is hokum after having read the whole thing(which is more than many/most christians can say) and no my lack of holy spiritedness has nothing to do with my calling shenanigans.|`|2rCZbaEIaa	tough question<br>  I would say yes and no<br>  as a litterary text, yes its understandable<br>  as a religious text, I don't believe so  because you really have to understand the holy trinity as well as the rising of Jesus by the holy spirit that fills you with the "knowing" that what you read is from God, that Jesus was wise beyond comprehention because of Gods presence.....if you are not Christian, and do not believe, you will have a terrible time "understanding" the information given to you.<br>  <br>  It took me a long time to go from understanding the logistics to understanding the feeling.  Once you do understand the feeling, your reading experience changes.|`|osZ5zVEDaa	What I have been taught over and over is that it is not studying it to reveal the true meaning of the Bible to us, but rather having Faith.

They want to talk about other things. Just as you want to talk about yours. <br>  <br>  If you want to discuss the greatness of YOUR god and YOU religion, find an online group for just that. These people don't want to hear your preaching (for the most part) when they follow a completely different religion. How would you like it if I came here and told you all about the word of (another God) and that it was right and the truth and you should follow it and your a misguided soul for following God who isn't real. <br>  These people have the same rights as you. Just because you've picked ONE thing thing to follow, doesn't mean everyone needs to pick the same.<br>  <br>  <br>  Of someone comes in looking for a bible verse, that's fine, answer it. But if someone comes in looking for something from a DIFFERENT religion or a more general question, that's not open ground for you to preach to them that they're wrong. That's the spot for someone who knows the honest answer to tell them, like you undoubtedly would with the bible verse. If you don't know the answer, it's not an invitation to convert. It's your spot to step away.|`|CrNrqvQFaa	It's not a Christian Forum. It never claimed to be that. Religion and Spirituality is a Question and Answer board for anyone of any faith or lack thereof.

740fffb14b811dc8703cc4da93076b24aa	If it's apple cider vinegar<br>  <br>  You've undoubtedly had that burning feeling in your throat at some time or another. It was once called, "Acid Indigestion." But if you describe the feeling to your doctor today, he or she will tell you its "Acid Reflux." To get rid of that raw, burning sensation in your throat, you might reach for Mylanta, Tums, or another over-the-counter medication. Although there are only minor side effects associated with these drugs, they can interact with prescription drugs you're taking. The next time you need soothing relief, why not try these homemade treatments for Acid Reflux instead?<br>  Your stomach naturally contains powerful acids. They're the chemicals that help digest foods, beverages, and medications that you eat and take orally. Your stomach has a lining that protects it from the acid. However, your throat doesn't have this same protection. So, whenever the valve that keeps the acid inside your stomach fails to work properly, and the acid rises up into your throat, you get Acid Reflux. <br>  If you wonder why the burning sensation can feel so painful, one of the acids that's always present in your stomach is hydrochloric acid (HCl). Hydrochloric acid is used in many industrial applications, that's how powerful it is. After you've eaten, your stomach churns out even more of this acid in order to complete the digestion process. <br>  <br>  One of the best homemade treatments for Acid Reflux is plain old apple cider vinegar. Stir a teaspoon of vinegar into six ounces of tap water. Drink this mixture during a meal to help avoid getting an attack of Acid Reflux. <br>  Or, drink this apple cider vinegar/water mixture after a meal when you feel the burning sensation start. It's not clear why one acid will help cancel out another acid, but the most important factor is, that it works. <br>  <br>  Or, you can mix baking soda in tap water and drink it instead. Use a teaspoon of baking soda and an eight-ounce glass of water. Stir the soda in well, then drink the mixture down. The baking soda will neutralize the excess acid in your stomach and bring fast relief to your Acid Reflux. <br>  <br>  Another homemade treatment for Acid Reflux is to try eating a banana at the first sign of the burning pain in your throat. Eat the banana slowly and avoid drinking any beverage for about an hour. This tropical fruit should bring you relief in just a short time. <br>  <br>  Or, if you prefer, then eat a half cup of pineapple or drink the juice. Pineapple contains Bromelain which is a group of enzymes. These enzymes aid the digestive process and support healing. So you can see how the Bromelain in pineapple can help cure your Acid Reflux. <br>  <br>  Along the same lines as eating certain fruits to ease the pain, eating the juice of a raw vegetable can also help you. The next time stomach acid gets into your throat, make yourself a homemade treatment that can't be beat. Wash eight to ten red-skinned potatoes. Then, leave the skins on, but grate them. Place the grated potatoes in a piece of cheese cloth and squeeze the juice out well. Drink a half cup of the red potato juice as a treatment for Acid Reflux. <br>  <br>  Raw potatoes and their juice is also beneficial if you suffer from stomach ulcers. <br>  <br>  If you suffer from Acid Reflux occasionally, then these homemade treatments can probably help relieve the pain and burning sensation. However, if you suffer from Acid Reflux on a regular basis, consult your doctor for a professional consultation. Acid Reflux that's left untreated can lead to more serious medical problems. <br>  <br>  Drinking apple cider vinegar and water is one of the best homemade remedies.<br>  <br>  The Bromelain enzymes in pineapple aids in digestion and promotes healing.The juice of red skinned potatoes helps soothe the burn of Acid Reflux.An estimated 10 percent of the American adult population suffers from Acid Reflux every day.See Acid Reflux in Action at <a href="http://www.gerd.com/intro/noframe/gena_shk.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.gerd.com/intro/noframe/gena_s...</a>|`|1d5df825c672e9f3cbcad75a42a030ceaa	There is no cure.

Whether you believe in God or evolution it does not matter, neither one intended for the human body to each such wonderfull foods as fetuccini alfredo or other simialarly rich foods or drink such fine things as beer, or other alcohoclic beverages.  Pastuerized milk is also another cause of ARD I have heard about.  No matter how you look at it our bodies were not designed to handle this kind of intake.  Some other causes of ARD that I have heard about but it's very rare is through the ingestion of geneticaly altered vegetables...you may have heard of them before, flavor savor tomatoes but they ended up causing lesions in some womans stomach so they took them off the shelves but there are other products with these types of vegetables floating around out there.  Sometimes it's something as small as how you mix the foods you eat, for instance when you eat meats your body needs to produce acid in order to break down the proteins, well when you eat starches your stomach needs to release a more base stomach acid in order to break down the starch, well when an acid and base mix, they create water...well when you eat meat and potatoes lets say, you are mixing a starch and protein and so in some people their stomach goes haywire and overproduces acid and burns the hell out of the persons stomach and throat so you get ARD and ulcers.  This is something you need to tell your doctor you want to work together to get rid of, go over your diet, do tests, experiment, just adress the problem and not cover up the symptoms.  Sometimes you need to push your doctor to do his job but do not take no for an answer, I know someone who had ARD to the point where it caused esophagial(spelling?) cancer.

TTjkE0Wcaa	The issue concerning any church and its practices should be “Is this Biblical?” If a teaching is Biblical (taken in context), it should be embraced. If it is not, it should be rejected. God is more interested in whether a church is doing His will and obeying His Word than whether it can trace a line of succession back to Jesus’ apostles. Jesus was very concerned about abandoning the Word of God to follow the traditions of men (Mark 7:7). Traditions are not inherently invalid…there are some good and valuable traditions. Again, the issue must be whether a doctrine, practice, or tradition is Biblical. How then does the Roman Catholic Church compare with the teachings of the Word of God?<br>  <br>  Salvation: The Roman Catholic Church teaches that salvation is by baptismal regeneration and is maintained through the Catholic sacraments unless a willful act of sin is committed that breaks the state of sanctifying grace. The Bible teaches that we are saved by grace which is received through simple faith (Ephesians 2:8-9), and that good works are the result of a change of the heart wrought in salvation (Ephesians 2:10; 2 Corinthians 5:17) and the fruit of that new life in Christ (John 15).<br>  <br>  Assurance of salvation: The Roman Catholic Church teaches that salvation cannot be guaranteed or assured. 1 John 5:13 states that the letter of 1 John was written for the purpose of assuring believers of the CERTAINTY of their salvation.<br>  <br>  Good Works: The Roman Catholic Church states that Christians are saved by meritorious works (beginning with baptism) and that salvation is maintained by good works (receiving the sacraments, confession of sin to a priest, etc.) The Bible states that Christians are saved by grace through faith, totally apart from works (Titus 3:5; Ephesians 2:8-9; Galatians 3:10-11; Romans 3:19-24).<br>  <br>  Baptism: In the New Testament baptism is ALWAYS practiced AFTER saving faith in Christ. Baptism is not the means of salvation; it is faith in the Gospel that saves (1 Corinthians 1:14-18; Romans 10:13-17). The Roman Catholic Church teaches baptismal regeneration of infants, a practice never found in Scripture. The only possible hint of infant baptism in the Bible that the Roman Catholic Church can point to is that the whole household of the Philippian jailer was baptized in Acts 16:33. However, the context nowhere mentions infants. Acts 16:31 declares that salvation is by faith. Paul spoke to all of the household in verse 32, and the whole household believed (verse 34). This passage only supports the baptism of those who have already believed, not of infants.<br>  <br>  Prayer: The Roman Catholic Church teaches Catholics to not only pray to God, but also to petition Mary and the saints for their prayers. Contrary to this, we are taught in Scripture to only pray to God (Matthew 6:9; Luke 18:1-7).<br>  <br>  Priesthood: The Roman Catholic Church teaches that there is a distinction between the clergy and the “lay people,” whereas the New Testament teaches the priesthood of all believers (1 Peter 2:9).<br>  <br>  Sacraments: The Roman Catholic Church teaches that a believer is infused with grace upon reception of the sacraments. Such teaching is nowhere found in Scripture.<br>  <br>  Confession: The Roman Catholic Church teaches that unless a believer is hindered, the only way to receive the forgiveness of sins is by confessing them to a priest. Contrary to this, Scripture teaches that confession of sins is to be made to God (1 John 1:9).<br>  <br>  Mary: The Roman Catholic Church teaches, among other things, that Mary is the Queen of Heaven, a perpetual virgin, and the co-redemptress who ascended into heaven. In Scripture, she is portrayed as an obedient, believing servant of God, who became the mother of Jesus. None of the other attributes mentioned by the Roman Catholic Church have any basis in the Bible. The idea of Mary being the co-redemptress and another mediator between God and man is not only extra-biblical (found only outside of Scripture), but is also unbiblical (contrary to Scripture). Acts 4:12 declares that Jesus is the only redeemer. 1 Timothy 2:5 proclaims that Jesus is the only mediator between God and men.<br>  <br>  Many other examples could be given. These issues alone clearly identify the Catholic Church as being unbiblical. Every Christian denomination has traditions and practices that are not explicitly based on Scripture. That is why Scripture must be the standard of Christian faith and practice. The Word of God is always true and reliable. The same cannot be said of church tradition. Our guideline is to be: “What does Scripture say?” (Romans 4:3; Galatians 4:30; Acts 17:11). 2 Timothy 3:16-17 declares, “All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting, and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.”|`|AA10192697	I love these questions.<br>  <br>  1. A bishop had several apparitions of Mary, one with Jesus and her, and she told him about future wars and gave him the rosary and prayers for the faithful to use for our future. The bishop met with the Church several times and proved that he truly saw and heard her. The Church then adopted these prayers from her. By the grace of God and His power, Mary can appear to people.<br>  <br>  2. Jesus gave His authority to the 12 Apostles to hear confessions, anoint other men to be priests, to baptize people, to anoint the sick, etc. These are the 7 Blessed Sacraments that the Church holds and given it by Jesus Christ Himself. It's in Acts.<br>  <br>  3. Lent isn't biblical, neither is Christmas nor Easter. There are celebtrations that the Church holds dear to celebrate the life of Christ.<br>  <br>  4. Intercession through Mary - Jesus' first miracle was done by her request. He said it wasn't His time and she said it was. Acts 1:14; <br>  1 Timothy 4:16; Hebrews 4:16. I can even intercede for you. I can pray for anyone and everyone earth just as the souls that are in Heaven can prayer for us. Only God answers them.<br>  <br>  5. Mary's assumption was prefigured through Enoch's assumption - Genesis 5:23-24; Rev 12:1-2.<br>  <br>  6. the Holy Papacy - Acts 1:20 states "for it is written..May another take this office."   Matthew 28:19-20 "Go and teach all that I have commanded you."   Acts 14:23 Paul and Barnabas appointed presbyters (priests) for them in each church.  Ephesians 2:20 shows us that the church was built on a foundation of the Apostles and prophets.  Jesus appointed Peter to be the first leader of the Church, His word on earth. Every pope after Peter (who was called a bishop at his time) is his successor. Jesus gave authority to Peter and gave him the authority to pass it to the next leader.<br>  <br>  7. Before the Bible was written and put together, the Hebrews/Jews held onto scripture orally. The followers of Christ held onto Hsi word orally. That's why the Catholic Church follow oral and written tradition today.<br>  <br>  The word "trinity" isn't in the BIble but there is proof of Him all over it.<br>  The word "perpetual virginity" isn't in the Bible but there is proof of her forever lasting virginity through the Bible.  <br>  <br>  Anything else?|`|h5q89E3Haa	Are you serious?

Don't forget to rip out the five chapters that contradict what you are doing. <br>  <br>  Get other people together to study it, implement it in your life, get the people who you study it with to implement it in there lives. <br>  <br>  Oh, don’t forget to get your official marine corps manual concordance, so you can look up words and phrases like “simper fi”, “Iwo Jima”, “Helmet”, “Grenade”, and “Honor”, etc.  And ask yourself what these words mean to you lol lol lol lol ... lol<br>  <br>  Now does this make you guys marines? <br>  <br>  I think not.<br>  <br>  You are missing pretty much everything that it means to be a marine. You haven't had the training that they have done for years you don't have the history -- the understanding of what it means to BE a marine as passed on from the founder of the marine corp to his first lieutenants and on down through the ranks through the years – the direct link to the founder of the marine corp. and writers of the manual, nor do you have the word of mouth testimony (those unwritten instructions that the founder himself – who by the way did not write the manual -- passed on to his first lieutenants, things the marines have been doing for years), nor do you have the true meaning of what the manual says. Because, of course, outside of the marine corp., the manual is MEANINGLESS.<br>  <br>  People who belong to bible studying fellowships who believe in the doctrine of solely scripture, scripture first, scripture only -- sola scriptura are no more Christians than are the people who got together to study the marine manual are marines. <br>  <br>  Now that you and your friends have studied the marine corp manual. Go out in front of a marine corp. recruiting station and as people walk in hand them a tract from the manual and get them to come join you. Go to a marine corp. camp and do the same thing see if they will join you marine corp. manual studying fellowship. But don't call yourselves that. Call yourselves, "marines". Go to the veterans day parade and hand out tracts from the manual there, and tell them to come to your marine barracks. Let people know that you have the way that all they have to do is study the manual with you and they too can be marines.<br>  <br>  Oh yes and erect marine corp. manual studying colleges and graduate what?<br>  Experts in misunderstanding the marine corp. manual.<br>  <br>  And OHHHH yes don't forget to call yourselves not just marines but "heroes(saints)", because after all everyone who is part of your marine corp., manual studying fellowship is a "hero(saint)", after all the manual says that doesn't it? Forget about honoring real marine “Heroes(Saints)” like Colonel Louis C. Plain and Gunnery Sergeant John Basilone; or Gunnery Sergeant Donald A. Levesque (RET); or Marine Cpl. Jason Dunham ... etc.; for after all the manual tells us not to do that, right?<br>  <br>  Then, go up to a real marine (if you dare) tell them what you are doing, and ask them what is wrong with it?|`|Bq0gqw7qaa	The list is too great, however if you adhere to worshiping on Sunday and not Saturday you already retain a non-scriptural belief established by the Church.

But when he comes, the Spirit of truth, he will guide you to all truth. He will not speak on his own, but he will speak what he hears, and will declare to you the things that are coming. (John 16:12-13)<br>  <br>  Therefore, brothers, stand firm and hold fast to the traditions that you were taught, either by an oral statement or by a letter of ours.

(2 Thessalonians 3:6)<br>  <br>  I praise you because you remember me in everything and hold fast to the traditions, just as I handed them on to you. (1 Corinthians 11:2)<br>  <br>  The Catholic Church does not use Holy Scripture as the only basis of doctrine. It could not. The early Catholic church existed before and during the time that the New Testament was written.<br>  <br>  There were hundreds of Christian writings during the first and second centuries. Which New Testament writings would become official was not fully decided until about 400 C.E.<br>  <br>  Catholics believe that the Holy Spirit was guiding the early church (and is guiding the church today) to make the correct choices about things like:<br>  ? The Holy Trinity (which is also only hinted at in the Bible)<br>  ? Going to church on Sunday instead of Saturday (which is actually directly against one of the Ten Commandments)<br>  ? The Communion of Saints<br>  ? Which writings include in the New Testament?<br>  <br>  Things that are even more modern like<br>  ? Slavery is bad. Slavery is never declared evil in the Bible. This was one of the justifications for slavery in the Confederate States.<br>  ? Democracy is good. The Bible states that either God should be the leader of the nation like Israel before the kings or kings should be the leader, "Give to Caesar that which is Caesar's." This was talked about a lot during the American Revolution.<br>  <br>  This second source of doctrine is called Apostolic Tradition. <br>  <br>  Do Christians who do not allow the continuing guiding force of the Holy Spirit to make their beliefs more and more perfect, still endorse slavery as Colossians 3:22 commands, "Slaves, obey your human masters in everything"?<br>  <br>  For more information, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church, sections 80 and following: <a href="http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt1sect1chpt2.shtml#80" rel="nofollow">http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt1s...</a><br>  <br>  With love in Christ.

A better question might be if societies Judgement is the only one we value.

Then, he has to order appropriate tests to monitor the progress of the patient and make decisions based on those tests.  There are multitudes of problems patients can experience during treatment and he has to know how to recognize those.

For they're no different than cells or much any other organism that works in a unit. A heart cell by itself will not beat, but when touching other heart cells, beats in unison. Thus people have a natural tendency to feel as though what you feel is what they should be feeling, and if those two aren't aligned something isn't right. Such being the reason why panic spreads and yawns are contagious, not to mention why crowds such as church congregations always seem to judge their bodily behaviors upon the consensus of the crowd. Now if someone isn't responding either they're an alpha of the group, meaning the one leading the actions, or the creator of the pulse so to speak, then either that is the case or, that they may usually be lead to believe that  there is something wrong with the incompliant one mentally, simply due to the fact that it's so innate and natural to do, almost like a principle of the universe. They may believe that they cannot comprehend the actual occurances of what is happening around them. This may be done out of fear of the group as a whole, for everyone gets their feeling of self worth as a whole from the people around them, truly, unless they themselvse truly are the Alpha person. The pulse. The self sufficient factor that is immune to all other forms of criticism and idea around it besides itself, which leads the rest of the group to whatever end. Innately, most all strive for that place. Mainly males. It seems to be hardwired into their brains for that. All in all, you'll live up to what your true place is. If you're through and through sure that you know what you're doing, there isn't a person, place, thing, or idea that could sway that judgement from you.

3d91f74d21cd6924a5e638e35f32cb2caa	Irshad Manji was disowned by her own mother for writing her 'book'. It was such a pile of crap that she recently changed the title to "The trouble with Islam TODAY". She wrote a book critical of Muslims across the world but her title was so inappropriate that it seemed as if she had written a book critical of Islam. She is of insufficient scholarship to critique this great religion, but any monkey could see the problem with corrupt leaders, petty criminals, uneducated thugs, etc etc. She failed to distinguish between the teachings of Islam and the wackjobs that call themselves Muslims. If she had half a brain she wouldn't have made such a mongo mistake with the first words of her book.<br>  Better luck next time.<br>  These people who leave Islam definitely have issues with themselves. Irshad's dad used to beat her mom, and then force Islam on them. Hmm, no wonder she's a lesbian. What I can't figure out is why she still bothers to call herself a Muslim.|`|AA10117437	Thanks for the recommendations.  I will check them out.  I am a Christian but I am interested in Islam.

2a746239500bd3fe73de1ca918bcf2adaa	I think you have put up with your problem long enough and that you have tried "the nice" approach already. I am thinking that you don't need your neighbor to feel that you had anything to do with calling the authorities for their assistance in noise reduction, so You might enlist the aid of someone else. One of the other answers mentioned asking the other neighbors if they were having a problem with the noise and that's a good idea. How about letting the noisy ones get themselves in trouble. How about advertising anonymously that they are having a party starting at midnight on a small poster and posting it at the supermarket and other places so that many people start coming and let your noisy neighbor have to start turning people away for crashing their parties. I am sure that they will not be willing to have uninvited guests come over and continue the party after they want to stop. It may take a few days but a few drunks sleeping it off in their sofa  the morning after might get them to stop. Put on the poster to come on in where the noise is and they will be there. Just a thought as this will eventually bring the authorities to the door to stop the problems and lets the authorities explain to the noisy neighbors that they have too much to lose by continuing their late night activities.|`|1f3b471d5810bc7fd40d10cf16368fc5aa	Every time it happens, knock on their door and kindly ask them to lower their volume.  When they don't lower it, feel free to call the cops to take care of it.  Several occurrences of the cops knocking on the door should take care of it.  Just make sure that you always ask them politely first.<br>  <br>  If it continues, you might also go to the landlord and see if there's anything they can do about it.|`|e163d852e64292b026150884c8aac74aaa	Asking them politely and calmly is always a good place to start.  Other try using earplugs to help you sleep through the noise.  If it is really unbearable and they're uncooperative, why not call the police and ask them to intervene?<br>  <br>  I've had many problem neighbours in the past, and I've had to resort to some really vindictive things to relatiate.  But that's really not worth it.  Just gets you really wound up and uptight.|`|ffe2a6d582f6501dc9c374c681d261bfaa	question-are they up all night and then sleep in the next a.m.?If they do, you can be particularly noisy some mornings when they are trying to sleep-maybe your neighbors will help if they are being bombarded by late night noise too-could also record them and let them hear(early) how much noise they actually make-calling the cops would be a last resort-too many loonies out there now!
a5767b9d3fa9f65d8bcc32645b625fb5aa	I think the christians responding to this question have just missed the point entirely.<br>  <br>  Here we go with you saying `Yes but I know God sent Jesus to save us, he told us so`, and yet you completely ignore that other religions have their own beliefs, also coming from God.<br>  <br>  You feel you are right because you know this from God, but other religions also know this from God too.

I have been doing so for some time now.  I still believe that I am a part of GOD's People.  I still believe that HE created all things and that HE is THE ONE who set this earth in motion.  We are not HIS PAWNs but an extension of HIS WILL.  I also believe that there are a number of other people that believe they have found the "truth" in their religious beliefs.  I always attempt to look at every belief without predjudice.  It is not always easy.  Thank you for this opportunity for others to express themselves without your being too negative.

There is no looking out side the box for salvation, that kind of Doubt, wavering, faultering is just what the enemy seeks in us. So we Christians who are mature in the written word of GOD, stand our ground & pray for those who are looking elsewheres. That they won't be sodomized by the devil & burn in hell.

One of them is quite blatantly labelling atheists as stupid morons for their disbelief another is saying they feel sorry for those who haven't "found" Jesus. So these are people who routinely insult and patronise anyone who doesn't buy into their creed-in other words moral degeneracy and personal inadequacy are prerequisites for being a conservative Christian. They're scum and I hate them with an absolute vengeance.

Dont talk about you spells,"know, will, dare & be silent is the motto. In case you have any dobts, it is fineto ask for things for yourself. Nature is always balenced , however. Give and be genorous and work magic for those you loveand for the earth in generel. Also, this is very important,If you know and believe it will work, that is 90 pecent of the work done and clence the room you do your spell in with salt and incence.

Put this into 2 cups, pour a little boiling water over it and allow it to cool Now you have to get the person with the bad habit to blow in tothe straw into the cup of water, they must emagine the habit being blown out of them in to the cup. keep blowing an till you feel rid of you. use the other cup to anoint the person with the habit( they can do it them selfes) on the part of there body most asosiated with the habit( eg: if he/she uses needles, you would put it on there arm vains) after you finnish your spell, poure the 2 cups in to the earth.|`|8527a78a7589f57cfc3a7e4e4457d185aa	Casting a spell will not rid a person of an addiction or give them any backbone.

Help him/her achieve fullfilment with any form of love..If you succeed even in the slightest degree,you will have started a great change and open a bright future of hope ahead. It may be harder than it seems,but remember :believe in yourself. Your friend needs you,and he/she is lucky to have you..And you are lucky to be given a chance to be that friend..Look for answers not in spells,but in the amazing power within you,and within him/her. Follow Love,it will not let you down.It will give you both strength and guidance. Good Luck,and God Bless.|`|465a326fbe4694a84993784ebf15140daa	First I would get their OK before you do any of that.<br>  Then a divination to see if it has a high probabillity of a good outcome is reasonable.<br>  If both of those pass - THEN you might try your healing spell.|`|2577f0992ce02aa0bade7b777b040d17aa	Perhaps you may wish to try to check some healing centres in your area; for example, Reiki healing.

9e71236ddd91a1ac14a12c704616491caa	Yes, of course property rights are a legal fiction invented by the human mind.  They are incredibly useful, though, because they set rules that dictate how humans should treat property with respect to each other, so that humans don't kill each other over who gets to eat the banana.|`|9BeUbORtaa	Yes. There's no such thing as a natural right. The 'right' to private property only exists when there is an authority which can guarantee that right. Moreover, it is a socially contingent one - not only non-human animals, but many human societies have no concept of private property, or very different ideas about possession to those which prevail in Western industrialised late-capitalist economies.<br>  <br>  It is at least questionable whether the pursuit and unlimited accumulation of private property is the best way for a society to operate, but we have become so accustomed to it that it is difficult to admit that there might be alternatives.|`|SXoxEkfPaa	yeah, laws and ethics, as well as the entire civilization.. are inventions of the human mind.<br>  don't listen to sociologists and the like baffle about "the origin of power" and blah blah.. the truth is<br>  monkey kills monkey<br>  dead monkey's relative kills the killer monkey<br>  monkeys kill each other and their population dies off.<br>  therefore<br>  no monkey is allowed to kill another monkey<br>  and the rest goes from there.|`|n55igpCUaa	Everything we interpret and put into "our own words" is an invention of the human mind.

0341a5f4a7f0251c27ed7bf8a89a6c6daa	Seventh Day Adventist have 28 fundamental beliefs<br>  <br>  1. Holy Scriptures:<br>  The Holy Scriptures, Old and New Testaments, are the written Word of God, given by divine inspiration through holy men of God who spoke and wrote as they were moved by the Holy Spirit. In this Word, God has committed to man the knowledge necessary for salvation. The Holy Scriptures are the infallible revelation of His will. They are the standard of character, the test of experience, the authoritative revealer of doctrines, and the trustworthy record of God's acts in history. (2 Peter 1:20, 21; 2 Tim. 3:16, 17; Ps. 119:105; Prov. 30:5, 6; Isa. 8:20; John 17:17; 1 Thess. 2:13; Heb. 4:12.)<br>  <br>  2. Trinity:<br>  There is one God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, a unity of three co-eternal Persons. God is immortal, all-powerful, all-knowing, above all, and ever present. He is infinite and beyond human comprehension, yet known through His self-revelation. He is forever worthy of worship, adoration, and service by the whole creation. (Deut. 6:4; Matt. 28:19; 2 Cor. 13:14; Eph. 4:4-6; 1 Peter 1:2; 1 Tim. 1:17; Rev. 14:7.)<br>  <br>  <br>  3. Father: <br>  God the eternal Father is the Creator, Source, Sustainer, and Sovereign of all creation. He is just and holy, merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness. The qualities and powers exhibited in the Son and the Holy Spirit are also revelations of the Father. (Gen. 1:1; Rev. 4:11; 1 Cor. 15:28; John 3:16; 1 John 4:8; 1 Tim. 1:17; Ex. 34:6, 7; John 14:9.)<br>  <br>  4. Son: <br>  God the eternal Son became incarnate in Jesus Christ. Through Him all things were created, the character of God is revealed, the salvation of humanity is accomplished, and the world is judged. Forever truly God, He became also truly man, Jesus the Christ. He was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. He lived and experienced temptation as a human being, but perfectly exemplified the righteousness and love of God. By His miracles He manifested God's power and was attested as God's promised Messiah. He suffered and died voluntarily on the cross for our sins and in our place, was raised from the dead, and ascended to minister in the heavenly sanctuary in our behalf. He will come again in glory for the final deliverance of His people and the restoration of all things. (John 1:1-3, 14; Col. 1:15-19; John 10:30; 14:9; Rom. 6:23; 2 Cor. 5:17-19; John 5:22; Luke 1:35; Phil. 2:5-11; Heb. 2:9-18; 1 Cor. 15:3, 4; Heb. 8:1, 2; John 14:1-3.) <br>  <br>  5. Holy Spirit: <br>  God the eternal Spirit was active with the Father and the Son in Creation, incarnation, and redemption. He inspired the writers of Scripture. He filled Christ's life with power. He draws and convicts human beings; and those who respond He renews and transforms into the image of God. Sent by the Father and the Son to be always with His children, He extends spiritual gifts to the church, empowers it to bear witness to Christ, and in harmony with the Scriptures leads it into all truth. (Gen. 1:1, 2; Luke 1:35; 4:18; Acts 10:38; 2 Peter 1:21; 2 Cor. 3:18; Eph. 4:11, 12; Acts 1:8; John 14:16-18, 26; 15:26, 27; 16:7-13.) <br>  <br>  6. Creation: <br>  God is Creator of all things, and has revealed in Scripture the authentic account of His creative activity. In six days the Lord made "the heaven and the earth" and all living things upon the earth, and rested on the seventh day of that first week. Thus He established the Sabbath as a perpetual memorial of His completed creative work. The first man and woman were made in the image of God as the crowning work of Creation, given dominion over the world, and charged with responsibility to care for it. When the world was finished it was ``very good,'' declaring the glory of God. (Gen. 1; 2; Ex. 20:8-11; Ps. 19:1-6; 33:6, 9; 104; Heb. 11:3.)<br>  <br>  7. Nature of Man: <br>  Man and woman were made in the image of God with individuality, the power and freedom to think and to do. Though created free beings, each is an indivisible unity of body, mind, and spirit, dependent upon God for life and breath and all else. When our first parents disobeyed God, they denied their dependence upon Him and fell from their high position under God. The image of God in them was marred and they became subject to death. Their descendants share this fallen nature and its consequences. They are born with weaknesses and tendencies to evil. But God in Christ reconciled the world to Himself and by His Spirit restores in penitent mortals the image of their Maker. Created for the glory of God, they are called to love Him and one another, and to care for their environment. (Gen. 1:26-28; 2:7; Ps. 8:4-8; Acts 17:24-28; Gen. 3; Ps. 51:5; Rom. 5:12-17; 2 Cor. 5:19, 20; Ps. 51:10; 1 John 4:7, 8, 11, 20; Gen. 2:15.)<br>  <br>  8. Great Controversy: <br>  All humanity is now involved in a great controversy between Christ and Satan regarding the character of God, His law, and His sovereignty over the universe. This conflict originated in heaven when a created being, endowed with freedom of choice, in self-exaltation became Satan, God's adversary, and led into rebellion a portion of the angels. He introduced the spirit of rebellion into this world when he led Adam and Eve into sin. This human sin resulted in the distortion of the image of God in humanity, the disordering of the created world, and its eventual devastation at the time of the worldwide flood. Observed by the whole creation, this world became the arena of the universal conflict, out of which the God of love will ultimately be vindicated. To assist His people in this controversy, Christ sends the Holy Spirit and the loyal angels to guide, protect, and sustain them in the way of salvation. (Rev. 12:4-9; Isa. 14:12-14; Eze. 28:12-18; Gen. 3; Rom. 1:19-32; 5:12-21; 8:19-22; Gen. 6-8; 2 Peter 3:6; 1 Cor. 4:9; Heb. 1:14.)<br>  <br>  9. Life, Death, and Resurrection of Christ:<br>  In Christ's life of perfect obedience to God's will, His suffering, death, and resurrection, God provided the only means of atonement for human sin, so that those who by faith accept this atonement may have eternal life, and the whole creation may better understand the infinite and holy love of the Creator. This perfect atonement vindicates the righteousness of God's law and the graciousness of His character; for it both condemns our sin and provides for our forgiveness. The death of Christ is substitutionary and expiatory, reconciling and transforming. The resurrection of Christ proclaims God's triumph over the forces of evil, and for those who accept the atonement assures their final victory over sin and death. It declares the Lordship of Jesus Christ, before whom every knee in heaven and on earth will bow. (John 3:16; Isa. 53; 1 Peter 2:21, 22; 1 Cor. 15:3, 4, 20-22; 2 Cor. 5:14, 15, 19-21; Rom. 1:4; 3:25; 4:25; 8:3, 4; 1 John 2:2; 4:10; Col. 2:15; Phil. 2:6-11.)<br>  <br>  10. Experience of Salvation: <br>  In infinite love and mercy God made Christ, who knew no sin, to be sin for us, so that in Him we might be made the righteousness of God. Led by the Holy Spirit we sense our need, acknowledge our sinfulness, repent of our transgressions, and exercise faith in Jesus as Lord and Christ, as Substitute and Example. This faith which receives salvation comes through the divine power of the Word and is the gift of God's grace. Through Christ we are justified, adopted as God's sons and daughters, and delivered from the lordship of sin. Through the Spirit we are born again and sanctified; the Spirit renews our minds, writes God's law of love in our hearts, and we are given the power to live a holy life. Abiding in Him we become partakers of the divine nature and have the assurance of salvation now and in the judgment. (2 Cor. 5:17-21; John 3:16; Gal. 1:4; 4:4-7; Titus 3:3-7; John 16:8; Gal. 3:13, 14; 1 Peter 2:21, 22; Rom. 10:17; Luke 17:5; Mark 9:23, 24; Eph. 2:5-10; Rom. 3:21-26; Col. 1:13, 14; Rom. 8:14-17; Gal. 3:26; John 3:3-8; 1 Peter 1:23; Rom. 12:2; Heb. 8:7-12; Eze. 36:25-27; 2 Peter 1:3, 4; Rom. 8:1-4; 5:6-10.)<br>  <br>  11. Growing in Christ:<br>  By His death on the cross Jesus triumphed over the forces of evil. He who subjugated the demonic spirits during His earthly ministry has broken their power and made certain their ultimate doom. Jesus' victory gives us victory over the evil forces that still seek to control us, as we walk with Him in peace, joy, and assurance of His love. Now the Holy Spirit dwells within us and empowers us. Continually committed to Jesus as our Saviour and Lord, we are set free from the burden of our past deeds. No longer do we live in the darkness, fear of evil powers, ignorance, and meaninglessness of our former way of life. In this new freedom in Jesus, we are called to grow into the likeness of His character, communing with Him daily in prayer, feeding on His Word, meditating on it and on His providence, singing His praises, gathering together for worship, and participating in the mission of the Church. As we give ourselves in loving service to those around us and in witnessing to His salvation, His constant presence with us through the Spirit transforms every moment and every task into a spiritual experience. (Ps 1:1, 2; 23:4; 77:11, 12; Col 1:13, 14; 2:6, 14, 15; Luke 10:17-20; Eph 5:19, 20; 6:12-18; 1 Thess 5:23; 2 Peter 2:9; 3:18; 2 Cor. 3:17, 18; Phil 3:7-14; 1 Thess 5:16-18; Matt 20:25-28; John 20:21; Gal 5:22-25; Rom 8:38, 39; 1 John 4:4; Heb 10:25.)<br>  <br>  12. Church: <br>  The church is the community of believers who confess Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour. In continuity with the people of God in Old Testament times, we are called out from the world; and we join together for worship, for fellowship, for instruction in the Word, for the celebration of the Lord's Supper, for service to all mankind, and for the worldwide proclamation of the gospel. The church derives its authority from Christ, who is the incarnate Word, and from the Scriptures, which are the written Word. The church is God's family; adopted by Him as children, its members live on the basis of the new covenant. The church is the body of Christ, a community of faith of which Christ Himself is the Head. The church is the bride for whom Christ died that He might sanctify and cleanse her. At His return in triumph, He will present her to Himself a glorious church, the faithful of all the ages, the purchase of His blood, not having spot or wrinkle, but holy and without blemish. (Gen. 12:3; Acts 7:38; Eph. 4:11-15; 3:8-11; Matt. 28:19, 20; 16:13-20; 18:18; Eph. 2:19-22; 1:22, 23; 5:23-27; Col. 1:17, 18.) <br>  13. Remnant and Its Mission: <br>  The universal church is composed of all who truly believe in Christ, but in the last days, a time of widespread apostasy, a remnant has been called out to keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. This remnant announces the arrival of the judgment hour, proclaims salvation through Christ, and heralds the approach of His second advent. This proclamation is symbolized by the three angels of Revelation 14; it coincides with the work of judgment in heaven and results in a work of repentance and reform on earth. Every believer is called to have a personal part in this worldwide witness. (Rev. 12:17; 14:6-12; 18:1-4; 2 Cor. 5:10; Jude 3, 14; 1 Peter 1:16-19; 2 Peter 3:10-14; Rev. 21:1-14.)<br>  <br>  14. Unity in the Body of Christ:<br>  The church is one body with many members, called from every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. In Christ we are a new creation; distinctions of race, culture, learning, and nationality, and differences between high and low, rich and poor, male and female, must not be divisive among us. We are all equal in Christ, who by one Spirit has bonded us into one fellowship with Him and with one another; we are to serve and be served without partiality or reservation. Through the revelation of Jesus Christ in the Scriptures we share the same faith and hope, and reach out in one witness to all. This unity has its source in the oneness of the triune God, who has adopted us as His children. (Rom. 12:4, 5; 1 Cor. 12:12-14; Matt. 28:19, 20; Ps. 133:1; 2 Cor. 5:16, 17; Acts 17:26, 27; Gal. 3:27, 29; Col. 3:10-15; Eph. 4:14-16; 4:1-6; John 17:20-23.)<br>  <br>  15. Baptism:<br>  By baptism we confess our faith in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and testify of our death to sin and of our purpose to walk in newness of life. Thus we acknowledge Christ as Lord and Saviour, become His people, and are received as members by His church. Baptism is a symbol of our union with Christ, the forgiveness of our sins, and our reception of the Holy Spirit. It is by immersion in water and is contingent on an affirmation of faith in Jesus and evidence of repentance of sin. It follows instruction in the Holy Scriptures and acceptance of their teachings. (Rom. 6:1-6; Col. 2:12, 13; Acts 16:30-33; 22:16; 2:38; Matt. 28:19, 20.)<br>  <br>  16. Lord's Supper:<br>  The Lord's Supper is a participation in the emblems of the body and blood of Jesus as an expression of faith in Him, our Lord and Saviour. In this experience of communion Christ is present to meet and strengthen His people. As we partake, we joyfully proclaim the Lord's death until He comes again. Preparation for the Supper includes self-examination, repentance, and confession. The Master ordained the service of foot washing to signify renewed cleansing, to express a willingness to serve one another in Christlike humility, and to unite our hearts in love. The communion service is open to all believing Christians. (1 Cor. 10:16, 17; 11:23-30; Matt. 26:17-30; Rev. 3:20; John 6:48-63; 13:1-17.)<br>  <br>  17. Spiritual Gifts and Ministries:<br>  God bestows upon all members of His church in every age spiritual gifts which each member is to employ in loving ministry for the common good of the church and of humanity. Given by the agency of the Holy Spirit, who apportions to each member as He wills, the gifts provide all abilities and ministries needed by the church to fulfill its divinely ordained functions. According to the Scriptures, these gifts include such ministries as faith, healing, prophecy, proclamation, teaching, administration, reconciliation, compassion, and self-sacrificing service and charity for the help and encouragement of people. Some members are called of God and endowed by the Spirit for functions recognized by the church in pastoral, evangelistic, apostolic, and teaching ministries particularly needed to equip the members for service, to build up the church to spiritual maturity, and to foster unity of the faith and knowledge of God. When members employ these spiritual gifts as faithful stewards of God's varied grace, the church is protected from the destructive influence of false doctrine, grows with a growth that is from God, and is built up in faith and love. (Rom. 12:4-8; 1 Cor. 12:9-11, 27, 28; Eph. 4:8, 11-16; Acts 6:1-7; 1 Tim. 3:1-13; 1 Peter 4:10, 11.)<br>  <br>  18. The Gift of Prophecy:<br>  One of the gifts of the Holy Spirit is prophecy. This gift is an identifying mark of the remnant church and was manifested in the ministry of Ellen. G. White . As the Lord's messenger, her writings are a continuing and authoritative source of truth which provide for the church comfort, guidance, instruction, and correction. They also make clear that the Bible is the standard by which all teaching and experience must be tested. (Joel 2:28, 29; Acts 2:14-21; Heb. 1:1-3; Rev. 12:17; 19:10.)<br>  <br>  19. Law of God: <br>  The great principles of God's law are embodied in the Ten Commandments and exemplified in the life of Christ. They express God's love, will, and purposes concerning human conduct and relationships and are binding upon all people in every age. These precepts are the basis of God's covenant with His people and the standard in God's judgment. Through the agency of the Holy Spirit they point out sin and awaken a sense of need for a Saviour. Salvation is all of grace and not of works, but its fruitage is obedience to the Commandments. This obedience develops Christian character and results in a sense of well-being. It is an evidence of our love for the Lord and our concern for our fellow men. The obedience of faith demonstrates the power of Christ to transform lives, and therefore strengthens Christian witness. (Ex. 20:1-17; Ps. 40:7, 8; Matt. 22:36-40; Deut. 28:1-14; Matt. 5:17-20; Heb. 8:8-10; John 15:7-10; Eph. 2:8-10; 1 John 5:3; Rom. 8:3, 4; Ps. 19:7-14.)<br>  <br>  20. Sabbath:<br>  The beneficent Creator, after the six days of Creation, rested on the seventh day and instituted the Sabbath for all people as a memorial of Creation. The fourth commandment of God's unchangeable law requires the observance of this seventh-day Sabbath as the day of rest, worship, and ministry in harmony with the teaching and practice of Jesus, the Lord of the Sabbath. The Sabbath is a day of delightful communion with God and one another. It is a symbol of our redemption in Christ, a sign of our sanctification, a token of our allegiance, and a foretaste of our eternal future in God's kingdom. The Sabbath is God's perpetual sign of His eternal covenant between Him and His people. Joyful observance of this holy time from evening to evening, sunset to sunset, is a celebration of God's creative and redemptive acts. (Gen. 2:1-3; Ex. 20:8-11; Luke 4:16; Isa. 56:5, 6; 58:13, 14; Matt. 12:1-12; Ex. 31:13-17; Eze. 20:12, 20; Deut. 5:12-15; Heb. 4:1-11; Lev. 23:32; Mark 1:32.)<br>  <br>  21. Stewardship: <br>  We are God's stewards, entrusted by Him with time and opportunities, abilities and possessions, and the blessings of the earth and its resources. We are responsible to Him for their proper use. We acknowledge God's ownership by faithful service to Him and our fellow men, and by returning tithes and giving offerings for the proclamation of His gospel and the support and growth of His church. Stewardship is a privilege given to us by God for nurture in love and the victory over selfishness and covetousness. The steward rejoices in the blessings that come to others as a result of his faithfulness. (Gen. 1:26-28; 2:15; 1 Chron. 29:14; Haggai 1:3-11; Mal. 3:8-12; 1 Cor. 9:9-14; Matt. 23:23; 2 Cor. 8:1-15; Rom. 15:26, 27.)<br>  <br>  22. Christian Behavior: <br>  We are called to be a godly people who think, feel, and act in harmony with the principles of heaven. For the Spirit to recreate in us the character of our Lord we involve ourselves only in those things which will produce Christlike purity, health, and joy in our lives. This means that our amusement and entertainment should meet the highest standards of Christian taste and beauty. While recognizing cultural differences, our dress is to be simple, modest, and neat, befitting those whose true beauty does not consist of outward adornment but in the imperishable ornament of a gentle and quiet spirit. It also means that because our bodies are the temples of the Holy Spirit, we are to care for them intelligently. Along with adequate exercise and rest, we are to adopt the most healthful diet possible and abstain from the unclean foods identified in the Scriptures. Since alcoholic beverages, tobacco, and the irresponsible use of drugs and narcotics are harmful to our bodies, we are to abstain from them as well. Instead, we are to engage in whatever brings our thoughts and bodies into the discipline of Christ, who desires our wholesomeness, joy, and goodness. (Rom. 12:1, 2; 1 John 2:6; Eph. 5:1-21; Phil. 4:8; 2 Cor. 10:5; 6:14-7:1; 1 Peter 3:1-4; 1 Cor. 6:19, 20; 10:31; Lev. 11:1-47; 3 John 2.)<br>  <br>  23. Marriage and the Family:<br>  Marriage was divinely established in Eden and affirmed by Jesus to be a lifelong union between a man and a woman in loving companionship. For the Christian a marriage commitment is to God as well as to the spouse, and should be entered into only between partners who share a common faith. Mutual love, honor, respect, and responsibility are the fabric of this relationship, which is to reflect the love, sanctity, closeness, and permanence of the relationship between Christ and His church. Regarding divorce, Jesus taught that the person who divorces a spouse, except for fornication, and marries another, commits adultery. Although some family relationships may fall short of the ideal, marriage partners who fully commit themselves to each other in Christ may achieve loving unity through the guidance of the Spirit and the nurture of the church. God blesses the family and intends that its members shall assist each other toward complete maturity. Parents are to bring up their children to love and obey the Lord. By their example and their words they are to teach them that Christ is a loving disciplinarian, ever tender and caring, who wants them to become members of His body, the family of God. Increasing family closeness is one of the earmarks of the final gospel message. (Gen. 2:18-25; Matt. 19:3-9; John 2:1-11; 2 Cor. 6:14; Eph. 5:21-33; Matt. 5:31, 32; Mark 10:11, 12; Luke 16:18; 1 Cor. 7:10, 11; Ex. 20:12; Eph. 6:1-4; Deut. 6:5-9; Prov. 22:6; Mal. 4:5, 6.)<br>  <br>  24. Christ's Ministry in the Heavenly Sanctuary: <br>  There is a sanctuary in heaven, the true tabernacle which the Lord set up and not man. In it Christ ministers on our behalf, making available to believers the benefits of His atoning sacrifice offered once for all on the cross. He was inaugurated as our great High Priest and began His intercessory ministry at the time of His ascension. In 1844, at the end of the prophetic period of 2300 days, He entered the second and last phase of His atoning ministry. It is a work of investigative judgment which is part of the ultimate disposition of all sin, typified by the cleansing of the ancient Hebrew sanctuary on the Day of Atonement. In that typical service the sanctuary was cleansed with the blood of animal sacrifices, but the heavenly things are purified with the perfect sacrifice of the blood of Jesus. The investigative judgment reveals to heavenly intelligences who among the dead are asleep in Christ and therefore, in Him, are deemed worthy to have part in the first resurrection. It also makes manifest who among the living are abiding in Christ, keeping the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus, and in Him, therefore, are ready for translation into His everlasting kingdom. This judgment vindicates the justice of God in saving those who believe in Jesus. It declares that those who have remained loyal to God shall receive the kingdom. The completion of this ministry of Christ will mark the close of human probation before the Second Advent. (Heb. 8:1-5; 4:14-16; 9:11-28; 10:19-22; 1:3; 2:16, 17; Dan. 7:9-27; 8:13, 14; 9:24-27; Num. 14:34; Eze. 4:6; Lev. 16; Rev. 14:6, 7; 20:12; 14:12; 22:12.)<br>  <br>  25. Second Coming of Christ:<br>  The second coming of Christ is the blessed hope of the church, the grand climax of the gospel. The Saviour's coming will be literal, personal, visible, and worldwide. When He returns, the righteous dead will be resurrected, and together with the righteous living will be glorified and taken to heaven, but the unrighteous will die. The almost complete fulfillment of most lines of prophecy, together with the present condition of the world, indicates that Christ's coming is imminent. The time of that event has not been revealed, and we are therefore exhorted to be ready at all times. (Titus 2:13; Heb. 9:28; John 14:1-3; Acts 1:9-11; Matt. 24:14; Rev. 1:7; Matt. 24:43, 44; 1 Thess. 4:13-18; 1 Cor. 15:51-54; 2 Thess. 1:7-10; 2:8; Rev. 14:14-20; 19:11-21; Matt. 24; Mark 13; Luke 21; 2 Tim. 3:1-5; 1 Thess. 5:1-6.)<br>  <br>  26. Death and Resurrection:<br>  The wages of sin is death. But God, who alone is immortal, will grant eternal life to His redeemed. Until that day death is an unconscious state for all people. When Christ, who is our life, appears, the resurrected righteous and the living righteous will be glorified and caught up to meet their Lord. The second resurrection, the resurrection of the unrighteous, will take place a thousand years later. (Rom. 6:23; 1 Tim. 6:15, 16; Eccl. 9:5, 6; Ps. 146:3, 4; John 11:11-14; Col. 3:4; 1 Cor. 15:51-54; 1 Thess. 4:13-17; John 5:28, 29; Rev. 20:1-10.)<br>  <br>  27. Millennium and the End of Sin:<br>  The millennium is the thousand-year reign of Christ with His saints in heaven between the first and second resurrections. During this time the wicked dead will be judged; the earth will be utterly desolate, without living human inhabitants, but occupied by Satan and his angels. At its close Christ with His saints and the Holy City will descend from heaven to earth. The unrighteous dead will then be resurrected, and with Satan and his angels will surround the city; but fire from God will consume them and cleanse the earth. The universe will thus be freed of sin and sinners forever. (Rev. 20; 1 Cor. 6:2, 3; Jer. 4:23-26; Rev. 21:1-5; Mal. 4:1; Eze. 28:18, 19.)<br>  <br>  28. New Earth: <br>  On the new earth, in which righteousness dwells, God will provide an eternal home for the redeemed and a perfect environment for everlasting life, love, joy, and learning in His presence. For here God Himself will dwell with His people, and suffering and death will have passed away. The great controversy will be ended, and sin will be no more. All things, animate and inanimate, will declare that God is love; and He shall reign forever. Amen.

We all have a natural tendency to be comfortable with people that are like us and to feel uncomfortable with people that are not like us. In an of itself, this is not a terrible thing in that it is easily rectified by expanding one's experience in the world. <br>  <br>  Racism, on the other hand, is prejudice supported by the fundamental institutions of society; education, media, government, employment, the justice system, etc. Racism is not easily rectified. It erects almost impossible barriers to success for those on the receiving end of it. Worse, those barriers are all but invisible to those who are not the targets of it. As a pervasive cultural mechanism, racism does not provide an easily identifiable target for opposition. It's not a surprise that victims of it might treat all members of the non-target group as symbolic of their oppression. Not a helpful inclination, but an understandable one. <br>  <br>  So, I guess I'd say that the two persons in your hypothetical conversation are not racist, merely human and prejudiced. It is the barrier of mistrust between them that results from the institutional racism that pervades society.|`|3p2IBMlVaa	A racist is a racist. They are so stupid and culturally shortsighted they do not realise that different white peoples, and black peoples have warred and discriminated with each other right through history, all over this planet.<br>  <br>  I've heard East Africans discriminating against Nigerians. I've witnessed African shop owners discriminating against English born Africans. I've witnessed racism between Jamaicans and Africans.<br>  I've experienced discrimination and violence between English and Irish people.

Look at the coon images of blacks on TV, look how we are treated. KATRINA anyone? Our real history is not even taught in school, they would rather have us beleiving that all blacks were slaves from africa. We come from kings and Queens. If you are not of color( I am from mixed heritage) then you have no idea of what it feels like to be black in a country 400 years deep in slave money. You have no idea of what it feels like to grow up as a black girl with only white dolls to play with, believing that black is dirty, and if only I were white then I would be beautiful. You have no idea of what it feels like growing up and only seeing images of white people, and only seeing negative images of blacks. You have no clue of the lasting psychological effects that slavery has had on black people( light blacks versus the dark blacks, that is mentality lasting today ask any black girl about that issue) But on a higher note, I believe that we are free, always have been, but it is up to us as a people to get educated(another stereotype is that we are all dumb) about our true roots.

I dont see people as in the color, but as people. But, black people need to realize that all white people are not racist, and white people need to realize that all black people are not racist. Same goes for all the other 'colors' out there. You cant just group all white people or all black people or all brown together like that, because there are good and bad of every race, color, gender... etc.<br>  I think I speak for all, or most white people when I say this: <br>  I am sorry that years ago "our people" enslaved your people... It wasn't right... and blacks were treated horribly. I get that... and there is no way to justify it... But, I am only 20 years old... I, personally had no part in that... so why am I being blamed for it? Just because I am white? Thats just as racist.

Case in point - Chinese 'dragons' were originally made up of the different animals represented on tribal banners.<br>  <br>  The classical, western idea of the dragon probably came from dinosaur fossils.|`|AA12384132	They were very real.

Many dinosaur and flying reptile fossils can help explain where many stories originate. Komodo Dragons (and the extinct Megalania) with a bite that kills (and probably feels like it burns) also seem to fit a dragon.

Think about this: dinosaurs roamed the earth for millions of years. Their bones are scattered all the way from North America to Asia. Surely, early mankind (being agrarian-or farmers) would have dug up these prehistoric beasts and not knowing what they were assumed that they were the remnants of a beast whose relatives may still be lurking in the jungle,forest, etc. But then again, I suppose there are real dragons.

Se sei rimasta stupita di alcuni fatti narrati, di vicissitudini puramente umane riferite a casi come quelli che citi, devi pensare che sono la cronistoria di avvenimenti dell'Antico Testamento, cioé la prima parte della Bibbia, che si riferisce ai periodi antecedenti alla venuta di Gesù, quindi era giocoforza descriverli in maniera realistica, per far capire a che punto l'umanità era giunta prima che fosse illuminata dalla luce del Cristo Redentore. Per quanto riguarda se sia opportuno o meno consigliare la lettura della Bibbia ai giovani, beh ti dirò che in effetti la Bibbia è un libro per adulti, però non la vedo così sconvolgente per i giovani, gli stessi giovani che guardano tutti i giorni i TG, che riportano violenze ben più atroci.

For example, there are cases where young women who have been raped are intimidated by family members to commit suicide to keep from shaming their family, or husbands will throw acid on their wives faces because the women had the audacity to make eye contact with a strange man.

Also, according to Islamic Law, women have the right to own property, operate a business and receive equal pay for equal work. Women are allowed total control of their wealth, they cannot be married against their will and they are allowed to keep their own name when married. Additionally, they have the right to inherit property and to have their marriage dissolved in the case of neglect or mistreatment. Also, Islam does not consider woman an "evil temptress", and thus does not blame woman for the "original sin". Women in Islam participate in all forms of worship that men participate in. Actually, the rights that Islam gave to women over 1400 years ago were almost unheard of in the West until the 1900s. Less than fifty years ago in England and America, a woman could not buy a house or car without the co-signature of her father or husband!<br>  <br>  Islam is winning Western women admirers despite hostile media coverage It is even more ironic that most British converts should be women, given the widespread view in the west that Islam treats women poorly. In the United States, women converts outnumber men by four to one, and in Britain make up the bulk of the estimated 10, 000 to 20, 000 converts, forming part of a Muslim community of 1 to 1.5 million.|`|d82fcb6de9ce28d93513b91d4bdf93b2aa	I know several Islamic feminists.

Her message was the type that more believers in Islam need to get across when their fellow believers commit barbaric acts.  Unfortunately, there is not enough of this type of coverage so the view many of us in the West have of Islam is of a barbaric and brutal religion.  She actually chastised her fellow Muslims for taking the Pope's message out of context. I say "Way to Go" to her for her opinion which was actually intelligent and not based on rhetoric from the clerics.  <br>  <br>  Why does it seem that most of the protests and barbaric acts from Muslim protestors are always at the prompting of their clerics?  Can't they think for themselves?  What is the hidden agenda that these clerics have?<br>  <br>  As to the question, I think Islamic feminist is someone believing in Islam who is also a proponent or activist for women's rights.

331444a2b76e68eeff0a4ce275773130aa	Great question!  Very metaphysical in nature!  So how would I answer it?<br>  <br>  The now is a combination of your personal perception and how you process external and internal stimulus.  It is a highly creative sphere that can not only influence your personal action, but it can also impact your environment and personal reality.  And what do I mean by that?<br>  <br>  Once information, stimulus, has been processed, it is your choice how you react and act upon it.  This is the creative nature of the now.  No two people will react or act on the exact same stimulating influences in the same way.  Ultimately, through your personal choice, through your ability to create that choice and act upon it, you are creating your reality.<br>  <br>  This is very powerful - yet most do not understand on any significant level just how powerful it is.  Your choices, your creativity, you action, create your world in the "now."  Ultimately, reality is within the now but what that reality might be is ever changing depending on your creative choices.<br>  <br>  Would you like an example of just how powerful thought is?<br>  <br>  I read about an experiment that was done recently (unfortunately I can't remember the source right now) where they took two identical plants, grown in the same type of soil then placed them in two different windows facing the same direction and getting the same sun exposure.  The only difference was, one plant was in one room while the other was in a completely different room.<br>  <br>  Each day at the exact same time, the two plants would be watered with the same filtered water and in the same amount.  They also received plant food once a week at the same time and same amount from the same plant food source.  So, what was the experiment?<br>  <br>  As the plants were attended to each day and at the same time of day, the experimenters would speak to one plant telling it how hideous it was.  How totally useless.  How worthless it was.  At the same time and in the other room, the next plant was told how beautiful it was.  How lovely.  How blessed they all were for being given the opportunity to be in the plant's presence.<br>  <br>  The only difference in care was the thought expressed towards the plant through speech.  And two weeks later, both plants looked very different.  The one that was harassed and told how worthless it was, withered and looked near death while the other plant, the one told how wonderful it was, flourished.<br>  <br>  You create your own reality within the now.

When you see an avantage to be gained, be it Affirmative Action, women rights, immigration, or celebrityism. This is more an issue of caste and money. Same as many American are treated when they go to other foreign lands where they bring the factories and the jobs(and usually reap most of the money). And when you have a commodity that is of importance to powerful friends, you know you have a back up(think Iraq war I) It is unfair but the people with power and money are seen different. Davey Jones of the former Monkeys said "when you have everything, people want to give you more. But when you have nothing, no one wants to give you anything" That is why the Paris Hiltons and Tomcats will be allowed to cut you in line or get the best table 96% of the time. People like being around rich and powerful people because they will meet other rich and powerful people. and maybe catch a crumb falling from their table(which will be worth way more than that on you and I) Think Brandi. She rear-ended another vehicle where the driver later died. You think she will see jail time? She may not even loose her license. What if that were you or I? He should not get special treatment, as well as many others.

Does this mean white people take advantage of the situation in the US?  Or is it a question of power, those with power have influence over those who do not. People of all races get special treatment all over the world, and I'm not saying they should.  But I do think you should not consider this an "Asian" thing.

Lawrence maneggia le sensazioni del lettore usando la lingua altamente descrittiva e dando risalto al movimento costante delle regolazioni e le azioni mentre accadono. La distorsione di tempo è realizzata by means of rallentando le azioni e gli eventi, permettendo al processo ed alle relative implicazioni di prendere la precedenza sopra l'atto in se. Quindi, “nel Crucifix attraverso le montagne,? Lawrence usa la tecnica defamiliarizing di distorsione di tempo trasforma l'operazione semplice del fieno di riunione comprendendo i particolari e la lingua attiva. Ritardando la sua prosa giù così precisamente, Lawrence ricrea l'atto semplice di fieno di sollevamento, aggiungente un elemento di importanza ai movimenti ed alle sensazioni coinvolgere. Questo rallentare delle azioni ha un effetto generale importante sul lettore perché dà risalto al centrality dei sensi e comincia ad informarlo di ammirazione del Lawrence per l'enfasi italiana sulla sensazione e sull'emozione. Le descrizioni come “chiusura intorno se? e “alla carne attiva? generano un movimento continuo ai livelli multipli. I contrasti nella descrizione servono da indicazioni sensual per il lettore, danti risalto all'azione di costante letterale dell'eccedenza di sensazione.|`|20f11946572090e62ba6566affad1cf7aa	e tu pensi che noi dovremmo tradurre tutto ciò?!... di solito i traduttori per questo si fanno pagare!!|`|6720a2e4a09fd7d2da468bdcf103838faa	maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa 6666666666666 fuori???<br>  Assumiti un traduttore....|`|b536c8e14ed51cfe62ac9ab8ee215f46aa	Spiacente, non mi piace quello che dice.<br>  G<br>  <br>  P.

Lawrence inoltre influenza le sensazioni del lettore con un linguaggio altamente descrittivo, ponendo l'accento sul costante spostamento di ambientazioni ed azioni nel momento precedente al loro compiersi.<br>  <br>  Con la tecnica della dilatazione temporale, Lawrence riesce a far analizzare meglio l'evento e le sue consueguenze così come avviene ne "il Crocefisso dall'altra parte delle montagne", dove viene descritta la raccolta del fieno attraverso l'utilizzo di dettagli e l'impiego di forme attive di linguaggio. Grazie al  rallentamento puntuale  della sua prosa, Lawrence, non solo ricrea il semplice atto della raccolta del fieno, ma pone in primo piano i movimenti e le sensazioni legate alla raccolta. Questa tecnica pone al centro dell'attenzione del lettore i sensi e le emozioni così come avviene nel linguaggio enfatico italiano tanto ammirato da Lawrence. <br>  Descrizioni quali "tutto chiuso in se stesso" e "carne viva" riescono a ricreare un movimento continuo su livelli diversi. I contrasti, se presenti nella descrizione ed in quanto prevalenti sull'azione, diventano ulteriori indizi sensuali per il lettore.<br>  <br>  <br>  vedi un po' se va bene.|`|e91fcc1ca2ae100471dc75cd6ab9357daa	Lingua attiva abilita efficacemente lo scrittore a lento in giù eventi.

La distorsione di tempo è realizzata da vuole dire di slowing in giù azioni ed eventi, mentre abilitando il processo e le sue implicazioni per prendere precedenza sull'atto stesso. In "Il Crocifisso Attraverso le Montagne", Lorenzo usa così, la tecnica di defamiliarizing della distorsione di tempo trasforma il semplice compito di raggruppare fieno incorporando così precisamente dettagli e language.By slowing attivi la sua prosa in giù, Lorenzo ricrea il semplice atto di alzare fieno, mentre aggiungendo un elemento dell'importanza ai movimenti e sensazioni coinvolsero. Questo slowing in giù di azioni un importante effetto complessivo ha sul lettore perché enfatizza il centrality dei sensi e comincia ad informarci dell'ammirazione di Lorenzo per l'enfasi italiana su sensazione e l'emozione. Descrizioni come il "ultimo tondo stesso" e "carne attiva" crea un movimento continuo su livelli multipli. Contrasti nella descrizione servono come indicazioni sensuali per il lettore, mentre enfatizzando sensazione su azione letterale.

Do not get discouraged for you are right and they promote evil.<br>  We have been mocked and ridiculed as Christians from the bebginning of time. Here are some scriptures that may help you understand they test of your faith.<br>  Joy in Trials<br>  1:2 My brothers and sisters, 4  consider it nothing but joy 5  when you fall into all sorts of trials, 1:3 because you know that the testing of your faith produces endurance. 1:4 And let endurance have its perfect effect, so that you will be perfect and complete, not deficient in anything. 1:5 But if anyone is deficient in wisdom, he should ask God, who gives to all generously and without reprimand, and it will be given to him. 1:6 But he must ask in faith without doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed around by the wind. 1:7 For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord, 1:8 since he is a double-minded individual, 6  unstable in all his ways.<br>  <br>  1:9 Now the believer 7  of humble means 8  should take pride 9  in his high position. 10  1:10 But the rich person’s pride should be in his humiliation, because he will pass away like a wildflower in the meadow. 11  1:11 For the sun rises with its heat and dries up the meadow; the petal of the flower falls off and its beauty is lost forever. 12  So also the rich person in the midst of his pursuits will wither away. 1:12 Happy is the one 13  who endures testing, because when he has proven to be genuine, he will receive the crown of life that God 14  promised to those who love him. 1:13 Let no one say when he is tempted, “I am tempted by God,” for God cannot be tempted by evil, 15  and he himself tempts no one. 1:14 But each one is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desires. 1:15 Then when desire conceives, it gives birth to sin, and when sin is full grown, it gives birth to death. 1:16 Do not be led astray, my dear brothers and sisters. 16  1:17 All generous giving and every perfect gift 17  is from above, coming down 18  from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or the slightest hint of change. 19  1:18 By his sovereign plan he gave us birth 20  through the message of truth, that we would be a kind of firstfruits of all he created.<br>  <br>  Living Out the Message<br>  1:19 Understand this, my dear brothers and sisters! 21  Let every person be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger. 1:20 For human 22  anger does not accomplish God’s righteousness. 23  1:21 So put away all filth and evil excess and humbly 24  welcome the message implanted within you, which is able to save your souls. 1:22 But be sure you live out the message and do not merely listen to it and so deceive yourselves. 1:23 For if someone merely listens to the message and does not live it out, he is like someone 25  who gazes at his own face 26  in a mirror. 1:24 For he gazes at himself and then goes out and immediately forgets 27  what sort of person he was. 1:25 But the one who peers into the perfect law of liberty and fixes his attention there, 28  and does not become a forgetful listener but one who lives it out – he 29  will be blessed in what he does. 30  1:26 If someone thinks he is religious yet does not bridle his tongue, and so deceives his heart, his religion is futile. 1:27 Pure and undefiled religion before 31  God the Father 32  is this: to care for orphans and widows in their misfortune and to keep oneself unstained by the world.<br>   <br>  <br>   Please see scriptures below.<br>  Psalm 1 1 <br>  1:1 How blessed 2  is the one 3  who does not follow 4  the advice 5  of the wicked, 6 <br>  <br>  or stand in the pathway 7  with sinners,<br>  <br>  or sit in the assembly 8  of scoffers! 9 <br>  <br>  1:2 Instead 10  he finds pleasure in obeying the Lord’s commands; 11 <br>  <br>  he meditates on 12  his commands 13  day and night.<br>  <br>  1:3 He is like 14  a tree planted by flowing streams; 15 <br>  <br>  it 16  yields 17  its fruit at the proper time, 18 <br>  <br>  and its leaves never fall off. 19 <br>  <br>  He succeeds in everything he attempts. 20 <br>  <br>  1:4 Not so with the wicked!<br>  <br>  Instead 21  they are like wind-driven chaff. 22 <br>  <br>  1:5 For this reason 23  the wicked cannot withstand 24  judgment, 25 <br>  <br>  nor can sinners join the assembly of the godly. 26 <br>  <br>  1:6 Certainly 27  the Lord guards the way of the godly, 28 <br>  <br>  but the way of the wicked ends in destruction. 29 <br>  And others experienced mocking and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment.<br>   <br>  (0.85) Luk 22:63 <br>   Now 1  the men who were holding Jesus 2  under guard began to mock him and beat him.<br>   <br>  (0.82) Mat 27:41 <br>   In 1  the same way even the chief priests – together with the experts in the law 2  and elders 3  – were mocking him: 4 <br>   <br>  (0.77) Act 2:13 <br>   But others jeered at the speakers, 1  saying, “They are drunk on new wine!” 2 <br>   <br>  (0.68) Job 22:19 <br>   The righeous see their destruction 1 and rejoice; the innocent mock them scornfully, 2 saying,<br>  <br>  (0.66) Mar 15:31<br>  In the same way even the chief priests – together with the experts in the law 1 – were mocking him among themselves: 2 “He saved others, but he cannot save himself!<br>  <br>  (0.62) Mat 27:31<br>  When 1 they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe and put his own clothes back on him.

But we are called to submit to our husbands the same way that we submit to Jesus.  Now the reason that I submit to Jesus is because I love him and I know that he loves me and has my best interests at heart.  It makes it a little easier to submit to someone who loves unconditionally and want whats best for you.  However men are also called to love there wife as they love themselves.  If he loves you the way that he should then he won't take advantage of your submissive nature.  Just remember that God didn't call for you to stay with someone who is abusive.  I would continue to pray for his salvation and be a light of Christ so that you can encourage him without starting arguments with him.  Umm as far a sex is concerned I believe that the marriage bed is not defiled so you should be able to explore each other sexually guilt free.  If he loves you he will compromise on making sure you are comfortable and satisfied in that area.  Good Luck and God Bless|`|49683857dcf4b2b1a5b611d4a3446459aa	I think many people have taken the word submit to an extreme. They forget that it also says "LIKEWISE",, husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church. Its is not a boss, subordinate relationship. Even Christian husbands completely misuse this doctrine to be domineering and dictatorial over their wives. This is not at all what God had in mind for marriage. It should be looked at more of a pilot,copilot, relationship. A husband that is viewing his role properly, would never want his wife to have sex with him, if she were not also wanting it.  You need to only surrender to God, and a marriage is never meant to be a slave/owner type relationship. Be a good example to your husband, but the bible does not command you to be a doormat, or a sex-slave. There are some really good articles/audios on this. Go to "oneplace.com". There are topics indexes and you should be able to learn more. Best wishes.|`|d9a0cd857c2e51d13d74349b6efefcf8aa	You should only submit if he is willing to be Christ like in his leadership.

They are considered a satanic cult by many americans.|`|sPDOMTTjaa	Here are a few ideas that you might run with:<br>  <br>  -The pilgrims first came here for freedom from religious oppression<br>  <br>  -America has "In God We Trust' on our money<br>  <br>  -The Pledge of Allegiance- "One nation under God with liberty & justice for all....<br>  <br>  -The concepts of liberty, justice, etc. were taken directly from the BIble<br>  <br>  -Our laws here in America were taken from the Bible. For example, laws on how to handle such things as murder, the death penalty & rape can be found in the book of Deuteronomy. For a more detailed explanation on this, see the link I provided below. <br>  <br>  -Also, God sent Moses to free his people from slavery in Egypt. So, this should tell us that God is against slavery & oppression but pro freedom. Have you ever saw a communist country/government succeed & produce a happy people? No nation has ever been as blessed as the United States, and Christians have no doubt that this is not only because of their love for God, but because our nation adapted it's laws & principles directly from God. This would make God an American.<br>  <br>  **Note- Don't get me wrong, I'm aware of the problems America is facing now & that a lot are most definitely not acting Christ like. What I am saying is, that the country started out w/ the right idea & has managed to somewhat maintain atleast one group of people that have followed this path since then.**<br>  <br>  -Hope this helps; & if not, please let us know more on what exactly you're looking for. I don't understand the 'thumbs-down'; I think most(not all)were honestly trying to help. <br>  <br>  **Re: wicca- The answers were that most think that wicca is a satanic cult. This is true. Most do. It would be false if that person said that they knew for a fact that wicca was a satanic cult. Someone cited a few cases that wicca had 'won'. That's great, but it would seem most have never heard about any of that in their entire lives.

Read his sermons and "Letter from Birmingham Jail" and see how he argued. He invoked God's moral law and Scripture. He called white Christians to be more true to their own beliefs and to realize what the bible really teaches. He did not say "Truth is relative and everyone is free to determine what is right or wrong for them." If everything is relative, there would have been no incentive for white people in the South to give up their power. Rather, Dr. King invoked the prophet Amos, who said, "Let justice roll down like waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream," in Amos 5:24. The greatest champion of justice in our era knew the antidote to racism was not less Christianity, but deeper and truer Christianity.

It is true, you can't really some one you've never met, but you can love someone you've never seen - ask any blind person.<br>  <br>  God wants to interact with us and participate in our lives, for some it's a bit more conspicuous than others.  The evident the contact, the greater the possibility of love blooming.|`|vtTUn0zcaa	Guess that's why they say love is so blind..|`|osZ5zVEDaa	I will say yes that Love without meeting someone is possible on two counts. The first being my Faith in God. I know from your phrasing that you may not feel any love coming back or perhaps have learned to tune it out, but most with faith tend to agree that they feel something that fill up their being coming from what we believe to be God when we open ourselves to him. <br>  <br>  Now could this just be a release of some brain chemical that tricks us. Well I am sure anything is possible, but that is where the Faith part comes in. <br>  <br>  Okay onto 2nd part. My first love was an internet love. We met online, fell in love online, and then only after 9+ months did we meet. When we met we were already in love. I had not met this person face to face and for all I knew this person could have been a 59 year old Dude who was a serial killer. I just had Faith and we were in a wonderful relationship for nearly 2 years. Now we have both moved on, she is Married and so am I. We are both good friends and I wouldn't trade it for anything. None of that would not be possible without a little Faith.

I don't believe that there is any etiquette about these things, but if two people are sharing one space and one person is using another... it doesn't make sense for the couple to have to pay extra. <br>  <br>  If there should be a differential in the RENT, it should be because of the extra space that the food takes up and the extra time spent in the shower (etc) - for rent I would say 60/40 is fair. <br>  <br>  With utilities, that should definitely be split 3 ways - no exceptions.|`|sJuwdIHSaa	if everyone is sharing the utilities and food then is should be divided into threes.  One time i lived with two other men.

Good luck.|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	I have friends who are in a poly-amorous situation where there is a husband and wife who have included another woman into their lives. They all sleep in the same room and share the same bed. They split their bills 3 ways, which includes rent, utilities, car payments, and food. To be honest, it's the only fair thing to do unless one person of the couple didn't have a job and other person within that couple was financially supporting him/her. Then, it would be fair that the 3rd only had to pay half the expenses.

How can a sane person *not* look down upon a group whose primary message is "God hates fags", and whose pet activities include picketing funerals and making inexcusably vicious and hurtful comments? They came out and said that some murdered Amish schoolchildren deserved to die.

Why don't you look in the mirror and any your own question.<br>  <br>  Mormons don't practice polygamy anymore people.  People routinely forget that Mormons stopped the practice over 130 years ago.  But oh...when the show Bog Love is discussed around here, everyone is happy as can be about polygamy.  <br>  <br>  About prop "H8" dont you people even care that CALIFORNIANS and six other states voted that day to hold up traditional marriage.  And CA did it twice.  If you or gays have a problem with that, move to connecticut or Massachusetts where they allow it and don't have propositions.  Their laws are made up by judges.|`|9m2LvlWdaa	Probably because they know a thing or two about said cults.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Because they are false teachers.|`|ItjUfDplaa	First of all ... Westboro Baptist Church isn't even a religion, it's just a radical hate group that seeks attention by protesting at soldiers funerals and getting their kids to hold up hateful signs at busy intersections. They're hated because they're hateful, and by the way, you're not a member of your church, so you're obviously a homosexual, so they would hate you too.<br>  <br>  As for Scientology, most people don't hate it, but most people think it's just weird and bizarre. In my opinion, every religion is bizarre, but Scientology is just ... really bizarre.<br>  <br>  And the Mormons, well they're hated by some gay people in California because they were behind Prop 8 which made gay marriage illegal again in California. It's just ironic because the only reason the Mormons fled to Utah was because they were being oppressed by Christians in the east back in the day, so it's ironic that they're now the one's doing the oppressing (or at least, supporting it). Some people also dislike them because their religion was originally supportive of polygamy, but now they deny that, and the FLDS is an extremist Mormon group that supports it and sets up weird polygamist towns in rural parts of western North America.|`|ZmdIlkpQaa	I don't look down on Scientiology, because I don't know enough about it to dismiss it.  It's simply not for me.<br>  <br>  I am upset with the Mormons for several political stands they've taken lately, most especially the huge funding they poured into the Prop 8 measure in California.  Again, the religion itself is something I don't fully understand, but is clearly not something I believe in.  I've no problem with those that do believe in it, except for their tendency to come around trying to sell their faith to me.<br>  <br>  Westboro Baptist is another matter entirely.  The members and the doctrine are hateful, deliberately cruel and hurtful.  I would not shed a tear if the membership were killed or injured in a bus accident or if their church buildings burned to the ground in an "act of God" type disaster.  They've a right to their opinion, but just like the Aryan brotherhood or the KKK, their opinions are disgusting in the extreme, and their behavior makes them little more than beasts.  I have volunteered twice to provide an honor guard for fallen Marines and their families because of these so-called people and their liturgy of filth.|`|S1Q1mVgJaa	Because if a Christian would ever take a goo hard look at any of those religions then they would see just how crazy there own is.

Christ tought love and WBC seams to stand for everthing but love. It feels like more and more churches are throwing away parts of the bible for it to say what they want it to.<br>  <br>  Scientology is just a brainwashing, money-making scheme.- and explain how almost any other religion is different.<br>  <br>  And the Mormon Church follows the teachings of a polygamous, false prophet.- false to you, rember that Jesus was called a flase prophet and was put to the most cruel way they could think of.

2de0b79e82da7f529f88b7bd06230c4faa	- I have blue eyes & I do have something to share with you about this, I also am touched day & night, I've seen spirits, & I have Crazy dreams as well. Forcing myself to wake up when I'm in deep sleep as well cause I did'nt like the "yuck" as I now call it. I like to dream cool stuff in my dreams, but yea, 3 or 4 times a night comes the yuck. I've heard it as being called - Being caught up in the spirit. <br>  What can I say, But to give it to you straight, after my grandma's spoke to me reguarding this issue (spiritual matters) I quickly learned about spiritual wickedness in high places, manifestations, touches so bold you look, Crazy. My Grandma's advised me to run to Jesus Christ & Share everything thats been going on with God & that the spirits were subject to his authority& command. So I did just so, I invited Jesus Christ into my heart & life, Jesus is so radical, I went to a bible teaching church & I learned who God was & I found out that He Loved me & that He garded over me when I slept, Sooooo comforting to know that God can kick ANY spirits butt. Since then, ummmmm, spiritualy everything got real mellow when I sleep. Ummmmm, when I'm awake, trip on this, now, I don't get any more hick-ups, or bloody noses, as very often before. The touches remain however, But the touches are not cold they are my body temperture, I've grown to think they are Jesus' warm hands & His taps are reminding me that he loves me . . . <br>  This scripture story is one of my favorite ; ACTS - 19:11-20.<br>    I'm microw, I just prayed for you . . .|`|716a08fdb977fc217a3df1f7525dc4c6aa	Well this sounds like someone making this up.. is it a joke????<br>  I have read that People used to be more in touch with themselves and the spiritual side... that people used to be able to travel out of thier body to other places in the world. we are supposedly made up of two beings but can't remember the names... sorry.... I never knew what to believe... if it was a tale made up many many years ago or if it was really so.... If it is so ... then well you are a Prodigy and be thankful for your gift... I would have to say you would be on your own and You would need to find your answers when you have your out of body experiences.|`|76ea3a562a33cdae910d9e4983afb205aa	Since your being apparently has a more than natural state as you describe, you probably will not be able to deny its expression.  Perhaps you can learn to exercise more control or discipline in experiencing it.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes the stress of career and life, or even the stress of trying to fight the experience can strengthen its manifestaion or frequency.  You should explore this in a monitored environment with carefully chosen people that you trust to guide your efforts.<br>  <br>  You might search out some universities that have a Parapsychology research program.  They could recommend books to read, or offer other services, or maybe let you network with people sharing such dreams.|`|91d4fbc3c75e4f7b862432c431187afcaa	Friend, after reading your story, There is true out of body experinces, but to have as many as you have & for as long, It is none other than a trick of satan, Because I look at several things your stated, The amount of times it happen, & able to talk to spirits even while you are awake, & then the spirits having cold hands, & also the one spirit that wanted to show you something, & then he changed his mind & ask you can he show you now, That is all a trick of satan, The cold hands is a dead giveaway, Cold represents death, But not of the body, but of the soul, That is satan ways.Yes the bible does say that satan ministers or angels can transform themselve into an angel of light.  But Friend don't be scared, satan can not harm you unless you fall for his tricks, You don't say if you claim to be a Christian, If you are not Then allow God to come into your life through the Blood of Jesus Christ. there is your true help. you can also get help by talking to a doctor, Or a pastor. If you give your self over to God, Then those experinces will not be as frightening. I have never had a out of body experince, But I have had dreams & they came to pass. Just the other night, I was dreaming about something, all I know was that I was after something, My wife woke me up,Because she thought something was wrong with me. She said I instantly started breathing real fast, as if I was jogging or running after something, but she just wanted to make sure I was OK. My wife knows if she sees me moving in my sleep that I am having  a dream, she nevers wake me up, because she knows if it is a dream from God, that I will be ok, & I can tell her the dream after I wake up. But the other night, she was concern because of my rapid breathing. Friend don't be scared.|`|35cd78158e164157d810e7b52896914baa	Perhaps you should be checked for the schizotypal personality disorder or bipolar for psychotic symptoms.|`|697fd39fe706cfb25781dae353fd72c3aa	Not everyone in the world is like you.

This happens to people who dream too much and also people who loiter too much in the hot sun where there jasmine plants and betal leaves plant. <br>  <br>  Example:<br>  Tom is a 14 year old boy.

Dialects are the particular things you say based on your region, socio-economic group, culture, religion, etc.  <br>  <br>  People who speak a particular language usually make particular mistakes while speaking another language.  They try to speak the foreign language like it's their own language but with different words.  So they pronounce things wrong, they forget which pronouns to use, they put things in the wrong order, stuff like that.<br>  <br>  Like, say, when I'm speaking Spanish, sometimes I forget to use the reflexive pronoun on certain verbs, or I use the temporary "to be" verb instead of the permanent one.<br>  <br>  You just listen closely, and you learn to hear the mistakes speakers make from a particular group.  It takes practice--I studied linguistics in college, which helps, but I was good at accents and dialects and stuff before that because I paid close attention my whole life.<br>  <br>  But it doesn't always work--there was this chick I worked with who was from Romania, and everybody (me included) thought she was Hispanic (couldn't tell from where) but she wasn't at all.  It's just that the way she spoke English sounded like she originally spoke Spanish.<br>  <br>  And BTW, anybody can speak any language.  We all have our prejudice for our own languages, but it's possible to learn any other language if you start early and work hard.  If you try late in life...good luck!  You'll need it.

e3e6e5b5145e6aed3ff96a161f0f920faa	Hi:<br>  <br>  Most of the time, it helps to see images to get ideas for me, so it may be difficult to get ideas from just text.  For me, the mosaic flower pots sound interesting.  You wouldn't even have to go for full blown mosaics with grout - you might try just getting some of those glass marbles that are flat on one side, and getting some of that silicone adhesive and stick those around on the pots - they are really pretty.  You could even get just plan window glass and stick translucent marbles on it, and wrap the side with copper tape and prop it in a window for a nice sun catcher.<br>  <br>  If you can make interesting shapes, you can also get air dry clay, and use cookie cutters or other shapers and roll the clay out, make your shape, apply any texturing you might want to the top of the clay.  I saw leaves made this way, with PearlEx mica pigments applied to them, and the leaves were rounded over the pots to dry and then attached with silicone glue.  You'd probably need to seal the flower pot and then apply the shapes.  A sealer would probably need to cover the shapes too since the air dry clay won't hold up to water or outside conditions.<br>  <br>  You might just go and browse a crafts store, you never know what ideas you might find there.  Also, if you want to see interesting glass related crafts, check out Delphi Glass - it's mostly stained and fused glass items.  Also, check out the artists community wetcanvas - membership is free and there are currently 94,000 members worldwide.  You might get some ideas from there too.

60c45179db766ab4d432c813d32b3402aa	la Bibbia si contraddice, è scritta dagli uomini e forse qualcosa può essere in bilico tra verità e realtà, ma spesso sono le morali di cui ne dobbiamo trarre conseguenza, non leggere come se fosse un giornalino o la recensione di qualcosa.<br>  <br>  La Bibbia è sorpassata e non capisco come tanti prendono spunto sola da essa quando c'è un Vangelo che soppianta tutti e tutto con la frase detta da Gesù:<br>  Ama il prossimo tuo come te stesso.<br>  <br>  Mettere in pratica questo racchiude tutto il senso della Parola e dei racconti biblici.|`|8237444cfc18a433408addbdab788b47aa	sono daccordo con Giuseppe r,bravo|`|15307a652e657b963caff04544c3e322aa	Penso che vi siano delle varie contraddizione. <br>  Dalle prime pagine del Vecchio Testamento trapela vagamente che, ai suoi inizi, l’umanità probabilmente viveva nutrendosi in modo vegetariano. Dio non consigliò agli uomini il consumo della carne dei loro compagni della creazione, bensì le piante ed i frutti, (Genesi 1, 29-30). Tuttavia, poco dopo, quella stessa Bibbia annuncia un messaggio terribile e crudele: “Il timore ed il terrore sia in tutte le bestie selvatiche e in tutto il bestiame e in tutti gli uccelli del cielo. Quanto striscia sul suolo e tutti i pesci del mare sono messi in vostro potere. Quanto si muove e ha vita vi servirà da cibo” (Gen. 9,2-3). Si suppone che Dio abbia detto questo, tuttavia, sappiamo nel frattempo come è stata redatta la Bibbia: in un processo durato secoli, nel corso del quale preti e funzionari di corte trascrissero testi tramandati e vi inserirono concetti propri. Più tardi, una selezione di questi scritti fu “canonizzata” e definita “Sacra Scrittura”. La tradizione ecclesiastica ritenne giusto presentare agli uomini un Dio irascibile e sanguinario che, in ogni immaginabile occasione, pretendeva un’enorme quantità di sacrifici animali, come “profumo soave per il Signore” (Lev. 3,5) e per il benessere fisico della casta sacerdotale, che mise in atto quest’affare sanguinoso, traendone profitto per la propria stessa esistenza.|`|c3b5da6dfe9ba562dba1b857761166d4aa	la Bibbia è stata scritta in periodi di tempo successivi e molto lontani fra loro.è molto complessa e sembra contraddirsi in molte parti.ma non si deve porre come base per costruire Religioni che NON ,ripeto NON ,hanno avuto esplicito MANDATO dal Dio della Bibbia!IL Dio della Bibbia ha costituito un POPOLO  non una Religione ! Yahweh degli Eserciti è Capo Politico Universale , POLITICO  non religioso. Egli guida con mano ferma lo sviluppo dell'Universo creato col Big Bang  e delega a miliardi di collaboratori la Colonizzazione dei miliardi di Pianeti abitabili che ha creato. Ma per quanto riguarda l'amministrazione spicciola del creato se ne interessa solo in maniera del tutto marginale! Dio non vive la nostra vita e non sà nulla di noi individualmente , del resto come potrebbe. Gli abitanti intelligenti dei Pianeti adatti sono miliardi di miliardi ! un numero quasi infinito! Ecco perche non si deve tenere in alcun conto la Bibbia nelle parti profetiche  o in quelle parti che sembrano dare comandi agli uomini di costituire Chiese! Sono superate e non corrispondenti oggi alla volontà di Dio . Dio detesta le Chiese costituite! Le odia in maniera totale! Egli ha messo nel DNA di ciascuno di noi la Sua legge naturale , basta quella! In attesa che i suoi Delegati arrivino  sulla Terra e sistemino le cose in maniera soddisfcente ! ciao.|`|f402c72ec65f49566728718ee6568244aa	Ha detto bene.La Bibbia infatti dice tutto, ed il contrario di tutto per cio' va capita bene e tenuto il messagio supremo, che e' amore rispetto e basta, a prescindere dal colore, religione, credo.<br>  Purtoppo esistono persone che usano la Bibbia vome strumento per odiare, tirando fuori dei versetti al proprio piacere. Credo che  intendeva questo. Non voleva offendere la Bibbia. Era solo per dire che va capita.Credo di aver capito.<br>  Infatti questo lo dico sempre anch'io quando vedo che si usa male.<br>  Quando vedo che si tirano delle frasi per offendere gli altri.<br>  Perche se uno parla con la Bibbia in mano, non si finirebbe mai per questo punto qui'.Per cio' credo va capita e tenuto il messaggio, senza usarla come un arma contro il prossimo.Come fanno molti religiosi di tutte le religioni con i loro sacri libri.E' il mio pensiero.|`|oC6kJZK6aa	La Bibbia presenta caratteristiche secondarie diverse in alcuni punti, come gli  indemoniati guariti da Gesù che non si sa quanti fossero.<br>  La domanda è: ma è davvero importante? Che Gesù ne avesse guarito uno, o 3 o 5, o 1.000.000 cosa cambia? Gesù ha scacciato dei demoni!<br>  Il messaggio biblico della salvezza e dell'amore di Dio non cambia in tutta la Bibbia ed è sempre valido.<br>  E così con ogni diversità minore: non cambia il significato della Parola, ma secondo me (SECONDO ME) serve a dare comunque a chi non crede un motivo per non credere, così che se un credente è veramente interessato alla Verità, la impari, ma se cerca soltanto una scusa per non credere, la trovi. In questo modo tutto dipende ancora da noi e queste incongruenze agiscono da "filtro". <br>  Questa è solo una mia idea.|`|0435054c5a15f209d53eb78e0c2ee8bdaa	Ti faccio l'esempio di alcune apparenti contraddizioni:<br>  <br>  ? Chi vendette Giuseppe in Egitto?<br>  <br>  Genesi 37:27 dice che i fratelli di Giuseppe decisero di venderlo ad alcuni ismaeliti. Ma il versetto seguente afferma: “Ora passavano degli uomini, commercianti madianiti. Perciò [i fratelli di Giuseppe] tirarono su e fecero salire Giuseppe dalla cisterna e vendettero Giuseppe agli ismaeliti per venti pezzi d’argento. Infine questi portarono Giuseppe in Egitto”. Giuseppe fu venduto a ismaeliti o a madianiti? Ebbene, è possibile che i madianiti fossero chiamati anche ismaeliti, con i quali erano imparentati per via del loro antenato Abraamo. O forse dei mercanti madianiti stavano viaggiando con una carovana ismaelita. In ogni caso, Giuseppe fu venduto dai suoi fratelli, per cui in seguito poté dire loro: “Io sono Giuseppe vostro fratello, che voi vendeste in Egitto”. — Genesi 45:4.<br>  <br>  ? Quanti israeliti morirono per aver avuto rapporti immorali con donne moabite e per aver partecipato al culto del Baal di Peor?<br>  <br>  In Numeri 25:9 si legge: “Quelli che morirono per il flagello [mandato da Dio a causa della loro condotta malvagia] ammontarono a ventiquattromila”. L’apostolo Paolo invece dice: “Né pratichiamo la fornicazione, come alcuni di essi [gli israeliti nel deserto] commisero fornicazione, solo per cadere, ventitremila d’essi in un giorno”. (1 Corinti 10:8) Forse il numero degli uccisi era compreso fra i 23.000 e i 24.000, così che entrambe le cifre sarebbero accettabili. Comunque, il libro di Numeri indica in modo specifico che “tutti i capi del popolo” coinvolti in questo peccato furono uccisi dai giudici. (Numeri 25:4, 5) è possibile che questi “capi” colpevoli fossero 1.000, cifra che, sommata ai 23.000 menzionati da Paolo, darebbe un totale di 24.000. Benché a quanto pare le vittime dirette del flagello divino fossero 23.000, si può dire che tutti e 24.000 ne furono colpiti in quanto morirono tutti per decreto di Dio, in conseguenza del Suo avverso giudizio. — Deuteronomio 4:3.<br>  <br>  ? Dato che Agag era contemporaneo del re israelita Saul, non è anacronistico che molto tempo prima Balaam abbia menzionato un governante amalechita con questo nome?<br>  <br>  Verso il 1473 a.E.V. Balaam predisse che un re di Israele sarebbe stato “più alto di Agag”. (Numeri 24:7) Nessun ulteriore riferimento ad Agag viene fatto fino al regno di Saul (1117-1078 a.E.V.). (1 Samuele 15:8) Non si tratta però di un anacronismo, perché “Agag” può essere stato un titolo reale come quello egiziano di Faraone. Può anche darsi che Agag fosse un nome proprio comune fra i sovrani amalechiti.<br>  <br>  ? Chi spinse Davide a fare un censimento degli israeliti?<br>  <br>  In 2 Samuele 24:1 si legge: “L’ira di Geova si accese di nuovo contro Israele, quando uno incitò Davide [o, “quando Davide fu incitato”, nota in calce] contro di loro, dicendo: ‘Va, fa il conto di Israele e di Giuda’”. Ma non fu Geova a indurre il re Davide a peccare, perché 1 Cronache 21:1 dice: “Satana [o, “uno che fa resistenza”, nota in calce] si levava contro Israele e incitava Davide a contare Israele”. Dio disapprovò gli israeliti e quindi lasciò che Satana il Diavolo li facesse peccare in questo modo. Per questa ragione 2 Samuele 24:1 sembra indicare che fu Dio stesso a farlo. Fatto interessante, la traduzione di Joseph B. Rotherham dice: “L’ira di Yahweh divampò contro Israele, così che egli permise che Davide fosse spinto contro di loro, dicendo: Va, conta Israele e Giuda”.<br>  <br>  ? Con chi si sposò Caino? (Genesi 4:17)<br>  <br>  Si potrebbe pensare che dopo l’assassinio di Abele siano rimasti sulla terra solo il fratello omicida, Caino, e i genitori, Adamo ed Eva. Ma Adamo ed Eva avevano una famiglia numerosa. Secondo Genesi 5:3, 4 Adamo ebbe un figlio di nome Set. Il racconto dice: “I giorni di Adamo dopo aver generato Set furono ottocento anni. Nel frattempo generò figli e figlie”. Perciò Caino sposò una delle sue sorelle o forse una nipote. Poiché allora l’umanità era così vicina alla perfezione, un matrimonio del genere evidentemente non esponeva la prole a certi rischi come oggi.<br>  <br>  ? Come si possono conciliare le cifre diverse degli israeliti e degli uomini di Giuda relative al censimento di Davide?<br>  <br>  In 2 Samuele 24:9 si parla di 800.000 israeliti e 500.000 uomini di Giuda, mentre in 1 Cronache 21:5 i combattenti di Israele sono 1.100.000 e quelli di Giuda 470.000. Le forze regolari al servizio del re consistevano in 288.000 soldati, divisi in 12 gruppi di 24.000 uomini ciascuno; ogni gruppo prestava servizio un mese all’anno. C’erano poi altri 12.000 uomini al servizio dei 12 principi tribali, per un totale di 300.000 effettivi. A quanto pare la cifra di 1.100.000 uomini menzionata in 1 Cronache 21:5 include questi 300.000 uomini già arruolati, mentre 2 Samuele 24:9 non li include. (Numeri 1:16; Deuteronomio 1:15; 1 Cronache 27:1-22) Per quanto riguarda Giuda, sembra che 2 Samuele 24:9 includa una forza di 30.000 uomini dislocati come osservatori lungo il confine con i filistei, non inclusi invece nella cifra fornita da 1 Cronache 21:5. (2 Samuele 6:1) Se teniamo presente che 2 Samuele e 1 Cronache furono scritti da due uomini con mentalità e scopi diversi, possiamo facilmente conciliare le cifre.<br>  <br>  ? Chi era il padre di Sealtiel?<br>  <br>  Certi passi indicano che il padre naturale di Sealtiel era Ieconia (il re Ioiachin). (1 Cronache 3:16-18; Matteo 1:12) Ma l’evangelista Luca chiama Sealtiel “figlio di Neri”. (Luca 3:27) Sembra che Neri avesse dato sua figlia in moglie a Sealtiel. Dato che gli ebrei usavano riferirsi a un genero come a un figlio, specie negli elenchi genealogici, Luca poteva correttamente chiamare Sealtiel figlio di Neri. In modo analogo Luca parla di Giuseppe come del figlio di Eli, che in realtà era il padre di Maria, moglie di Giuseppe. — Luca 3:23.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ? Da quanti uomini Gesù Cristo espulse i demoni che poi si impossessarono di un grosso branco di porci?<br>  <br>  L’evangelista Matteo parla di due uomini, mentre Marco e Luca ne menzionano uno solo. (Matteo 8:28; Marco 5:2; Luca 8:27) A quanto pare Marco e Luca richiamano l’attenzione su un solo indemoniato perché Gesù si rivolse a lui e il suo caso era più notevole. Forse quell’uomo era più violento o aveva sofferto più a lungo sotto il possesso demonico. è possibile che solo quell’uomo volesse poi accompagnare Gesù. (Marco 5:18-20) Descrivendo una situazione sotto un certo aspetto analoga, Matteo parla di due ciechi guariti da Gesù, mentre Marco e Luca ne menzionano uno solo. (Matteo 20:29-34; Marco 10:46; Luca 18:35) Non c’è contraddizione, perché le tre narrazioni hanno in comune la presenza di almeno un uomo con quelle caratteristiche.<br>  <br>  GIORGIO 1769: quello che dici è una prova che l'autore della Bibbia è Dio,  non coloro che l'hanno scritta. E' stato Dio a far in modo che la sua parola giungesse fino a noi.<br>  Sai che nel Medio Evo chi aveva una Bibbia rischiava di finire al rogo. Molti ci sono finiti. Perché hanno rischiato e perso la vita per un libro? Non parliamo poi dell'armonia interna della Bibbia: dall'inizio alla fine sviluppa lo stesso tema: Il Regno di Dio che rivendicherà la sovranità universale di Dio.<br>  <br>  FEDERICO P <br>  a proposito dall'apparente contraddizione di cui parli:<br>  alcuni anni fa, una società di liberi pensatori di New York chiese alla Watch Tower Society di mandare due oratori perché parlassero al loro gruppo su argomenti biblici, richiesta che fu accolta. Quei dotti si attenevano alla massima latina falsum in uno falsum in toto, secondo cui l’argomento che risulta fallace in un punto lo è anche nell’insieme. Durante l’incontro, uno di loro sfidò i testimoni di Geova sull’attendibilità della Bibbia. Chiese che si leggesse ai presenti Genesi 1:3, e ciò fu fatto dalla Traduzione del Nuovo Mondo: “E Dio diceva: ‘Si faccia luce’. Quindi si fece luce”. Con sicurezza egli chiese poi che si leggesse Genesi 1:14, e anche questo passo fu letto dalla Traduzione del Nuovo Mondo: “E Dio proseguì, dicendo: ‘Si facciano luminari nella distesa dei cieli’”. “Alt”, disse lo sfidante, “che cosa sta leggendo? La mia Bibbia dice che Dio fece la luce il primo giorno, e di nuovo il quarto giorno, e questa è un’incoerenza”. Quantunque asserisse di conoscere l’ebraico, gli si dovette mostrare che la parola ebraica tradotta “luce” al versetto 3 era ’ohr, mentre la parola del versetto 14 era ma’òhr, che indica un corpo luminoso, cioè una fonte di luce. L’erudito si mise a sedere sconfitto. La Traduzione del Nuovo Mondo, con la sua fedele coerenza, aveva avuto la meglio, a riprova che la Bibbia è fidata e utile.<br>  <br>  Spero di aver dissipato i tuoi dubbi.

Di che colore era il mantello che Gesù indossava il giorno in cui morì?<br>  <br>  Secondo Marco (15:17) e Giovanni (19:2), i soldati fecero indossare a Gesù un mantello di porpora. Matteo (27:28) parla invece di “un manto scarlatto”, dando risalto al rosso. Poiché porpora può indicare qualunque colore che includa sia il rosso che il blu, Marco e Giovanni concordano sul fatto che il colore del mantello aveva una tonalità di rosso. I riflessi e lo sfondo possono aver conferito al mantello sfumature diverse, e gli evangelisti menzionano il colore che li colpì di più o che era rimasto più impresso a coloro dai quali ricevettero le informazioni. La lieve differenza rivela l’individualità degli scrittori e dimostra che non si erano messi d’accordo sulla versione da dare.<br>  <br>  ? Chi portò il palo di tortura di Gesù?<br>  <br>  Giovanni (19:17) dice: “Ed egli, portando da sé il palo di tortura, uscì verso il cosiddetto Luogo del Teschio, che in ebraico si chiama Gòlgotha”. Matteo (27:32), Marco (15:21) e Luca (23:26) dicono invece che, ‘mentre uscivano, Simone di Cirene fu costretto a prestare servizio perché portasse il palo di tortura’. Come afferma Giovanni, Gesù portò il suo palo di tortura. Nel suo racconto condensato, però, Giovanni non include il particolare secondo cui successivamente Simone fu costretto a portare il palo. Non c’è quindi nessuna discordanza fra i racconti evangelici a questo riguardo.<br>  <br>  ? Come morì Giuda Iscariota?<br>  <br>  Matteo 27:5 dice che Giuda si impiccò, mentre Atti 1:18 dice che, “cadendo a capofitto, si squarciò rumorosamente nel mezzo, e tutti i suoi intestini si sparsero”. Mentre Matteo sembra indicare la maniera in cui avvenne il tentato suicidio, Atti ne descrive i risultati. A quanto pare Giuda legò una fune al ramo di un albero, si mise il cappio al collo e tentò di impiccarsi saltando giù da una rupe. Sembra però che la fune o il ramo si sia spezzato così che egli precipitò e si sfracellò sulle rocce sottostanti. La topografia dei dintorni di Gerusalemme mostra che questa conclusione è ragionevole.<br>  <br>  Che atteggiamento assumerete?<br>  <br>  Quando nella Bibbia incontriamo apparenti discordanze, è bene ricordare che spesso versioni fornite da persone diverse sembrano contraddittorie, ma si possono facilmente spiegare o comprendere. Per esempio, un uomo d’affari può inviare a qualcuno una lettera che ha dettato alla sua segretaria. Se gli venisse chiesto chi ha inviato la lettera, direbbe che è stato lui. Ma poiché è stata lei a batterla a macchina e a spedirla, anche la segretaria potrebbe dire di avere inviato quella lettera. Similmente non c’è contraddizione fra Matteo (8:5) che dice che un ufficiale dell’esercito andò da Gesù a chiedergli un favore e Luca (7:2,?3) secondo cui l’uomo mandò altri in vece sua.<br>  <br>  Ulteriori prove....=)

be0eeaa0579d900b9661f58300533430aa	Yes... God matters hundred percent in the study of religions. Why?<br>  <br>  Talking of Jesus Christ... he gained enlightenment because he walked the path of God. Enlightenment cannot be gained by any human being unless one travels the spiritual path which leads directly to the kingdom of God (aka Baikuntha in Hinduism).<br>  <br>  Mahavira, Gautama Buddha, Jesus Christ and Prophet Mohammed... all gained enlightenment for they wanted to reach the kingdom of God for ever. They all knew that going to the kingdom of God was a one-way affair. Having reached the kingdom of God... a point of no return they knew it was the end of the journey forever!<br>  <br>  Kingdom of God can only be reached when our soul (aka atman in Hinduism) liberates forever from the cycle of birth and death and leaves the earthly abode for ever.<br>  <br>  Every spiritual person (here we need to understand that not every religious but only spiritual person) has only one goal of life... search for God and reach for the kingdom of God at the earliest. Mahavira, Gautama Buddha, Jesus Christ and Prophet Mohammed... all reached the stage of salvation (aka moksha in Hinduism) within their lifetime.<br>  <br>  Having gained enlightenment Jesus Christ preached the Wisdom to the community. He developed a mass following that was termed as Christianity. And thus was born Christian religion. 423 years before Jesus Christ came Gautama Buddha. Having gained enlightenment he also preached the Wisdom of the sacred scriptures to the masses. This led to his having a large following and the religion was termed as Buddhism.<br>  <br>  Those who travel the path of religion need not necessarily be interested in gaining enlightenment and then salvation within their lifetime. But every spiritual seeker has only one goal of life... gain enlightenment and finally salvation at the earliest.<br>  <br>  Religion helps one live the physical manifested life in a harmonious manner. It develops a community feeling amongst all. It strengthens the resolve of humanity to achieve the best in life. Had religion not been there... it would have become difficult to differentiate animals from human beings. Religion helps maintain this crucial balance.<br>  <br>  Religion also reminds us that there is someone above all human beings... the power of God! It is this power of God that dissuades human beings from doing the wrong!

However, we are all aware of the fact that each religion, society and culture from the past and into the present has had a different name for God and has given him different attributes or qualities. This does not mean there really are different Gods. There are only different concepts of what God is held by mankind. Much of these different concepts are regulated or have been developed due to the culture and society form which they originate.<br>  Without God or a Supreme Being there would be no inspiration for religion. Take away the veils that have been placed over God by mankind and it would be shown that the basic beliefs of religion are the same.<br>  <br>  For more information visit, <a href="http://meta.euleesway.com" rel="nofollow">http://meta.euleesway.com</a>|`|ffa536b8f85fd05c8d52d57caeda20f5aa	I can't give you notable arguments from theologians, but I can tell you what I know from studying  religion in Catholic school.  We had to take a course on world religions and during that course we talked about different cultures behind the religion, ceremonies, rituals, traditions, and a little about what their gods were called, a background story, etc.  But we never really discussed why they believed, and we didn't do that learning about Catholicism either.  So in my opinion, people haven't placed too much importance on him.  They'll fight to spread their religion, or die in his name or simply use him as an excuse to claim superiority (ex, Crusades, Inquisition) but religion as a whole rarely sets out to live in his example.  And if you see it being done, it's bc it was that person's personal choice.|`|4770ec96b00c277a1052a824b2656201aa	Your question is a little ambiguous.<br>  <br>  The study of religion is not theology, which is:<br>  <br>  1. The study of the nature of God and religious truth; rational inquiry into religious questions.<br>  2. A system or school of opinions concerning God and religious questions: Protestant theology; Jewish theology.<br>  3. A course of specialized religious study usually at a college or seminary.<br>  <br>  A person who has no religious convictions at all may study religions, and for that person God wouldn't matter at all in their pursuit of knowledge.<br>  <br>  A person in a religion that is unconcerned with the existence of God (Taoism, for example) may study religions, and for that person God wouldn't matter at all in their pursuit of knowledge.<br>  <br>  A person whose religion doesn't include the God of the Abrahamic religions may study....well, you get the idea.<br>  <br>  I'm really not sure what you're asking for.<br>  <br>  But if what you are looking for is works by important Christian theologians, a good place to start is here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://people.bu.edu/bpstone/theology/theolog.html" rel="nofollow">http://people.bu.edu/bpstone/theology/th...</a>|`|e3f076ffc3524fd3a59f9050154f6707aa	Of course God must be related to the religion, because only God's religion is true, not like others man-made religion / God.<br>  But until now not many people believed that there is only One God, the Almighty, Allah.

UmjJmYsjaa	Question 1: How could God produce light on the first day if the luminaries were not made until the fourth day? (Genesis 1:3,16) [w04 1/1 p. 28 par 5.]<br>  The lights were already there, but luminaries in 16 give an indication that it was from an earthly perspective, when the lights were finally visible on the earth surface.<br>  <br>  2. What is suggested by the fact that Jehovah did not tell Noah to subdue the earth as he had told perfect adam? (Genesis 9:1) [it-2 p. 1095 par. 6]<br>  Unlike Adam, Noah was imperfect and could not Subdue the earth. Subdue by definiton means  to conquer and bring into subjection which Noah could not do.<br>  <br>  3. On what date did the Abrahamic Covenant go into effect, and how long does it last.? (Gen 12:1-4) [w04 1/15 p 26 par 4: w01 8/15 p. 17 par 13]<br>  Jehovah’s covenant with Abram that “all the families of the ground will certainly bless themselves by means of [Abram]” apparently went into effect when Abram crossed the Euphrates on his way to Canaan. This must have been on Nisan 14, 1943?B.C.E.—430 years before Israel was delivered from Egypt. (Exodus 12:2, 6, 7, 40,?41) The Abrahamic covenant is “a covenant to time indefinite.” It remains in effect until the blessing of the families of the earth and the destruction of all God’s enemies have been accomplished.—Genesis 17:7; 1?Corinthians 15:23-26.<br>  <br>  <br>  4. What proves that Nimrod and those who followed his lead failed in thier goal to make 'a celebrated name for themselves'? (Gen 11:4) [w98 3/15 p 25]<br>  Well Nimrods original name is lost. Nimrod wasnt His name but it was given to him due to the negetive meaning behind his name, which means. 'a mighty hunter in defiance of Jehovah.'  The rabbinic writings derived the name Nimrod from the Hebrew verb ma?radh′, meaning “rebel.<br>  Since mankind today does not know his name gives an indication that he did not succeed.<br>  <br>  5. Since Lot is called a "righteous" man at 2 Peter 2:7, why might he have offered his daughters to the perverted mob? (Gen 19:8) [w05 2/1 p 26 par 15-16: w04 1/15 p 27 par 3]<br>  Lots knew what had happen to Abraham and Sarah in Egypt and how Jehovah had protected him and his wife. The two men that were in his house were angels and so Lot could have known that no harm was going to come to his daughters. Also, his daughters were engaged to two men of the city and the Mob and Lot could have known that nothing would have hurt them, and Jehovah did indeed protect them.<br>  <br>  6. Since godly husbands should care for thier own, how could Abraham send Hagar and Ishmael into the wilderness? (Gen 21:10-21: 1 Tim 5:8) [w88 2/15 p31]<br>  Jehovah told Abraham to listen to his wife. Sarah was afraid of Ismeal. Ismeal was making fun of Issac, but not the way we think of it, Sarah feared for her sons life. Ismeal was maybe in 19 while Issac was only 5 years old. This ridicule was more serious than what it sounded. Abraham knowing that Jehovah is wise and righteous knew that Jehovah had a good reason to say 'obey your wife'. Abraham did provide the Necesities for her, and Jehovah also promised that a nation would asrise from Ismeal.<br>  <br>  7. What lesson can we learn from Eliezer's effort to do things Jehovah's way in finding a wife for Issac? ( Gen 24:14,15, 17-19 26,27) [w97 1/1 p31 par 2]<br>  Eliezer had to put forth much effort to do things Jehovah’s way. We too may find that conforming to Jehovah’s standards is not always easy. For example, it may be hard to find employment that does not stifle theocratic activity, a mate that is God-fearing, associates that are upbuilding, entertainment that is not debasing<br>  <br>  8. What was the meaning of Jacobs dream in which he saw angels 'ascending and desending on a ladder'? (Gen 28:10-13) [w03 10/15 p29 par 1: it-2 p189]<br>  . God’s angels were ascending and descending on the ladder, and a representation of Jehovah God was above it. (Ge 28:13) This ladder with the angels upon it indicates the existence of communication between earth and heaven and that angels minister in an important way between God and those having his approval.<br>  <br>  9. (I think you've answered this one already) I'll still post what w04 1/15 p. 28 par 7 reads.]<br>  In ancient times, the fruit of the mandrake plant was used in medicine as a narcotic and for preventing or relieving spasms. The fruit was also credited with the capacity to excite sexual desire and to increase human fertility or aid in conception. (Song of Solomon 7:13) While the Bible does not reveal Rachel’s motive for the exchange, she may have thought that the mandrakes would help her conceive and end her reproach of being barren. However, it was some years before Jehovah “opened her womb.”—Genesis 30:22-24.<br>  <br>  10. How is Jacobs example a good one in resolving personal disputes? (Gen 33:3,4) [g82 2/22 p. 19 pars. 8-10]<br>  In reading the account in Genesis chapters 32 and 33 you can feel the tension build as these feuding brothers prepare to meet; Jacob with his flocks and children, Esau with his band of 400 men! Murder is doubtless in Esau’s mind. Yet Jacob is determined to make peace. He humbly makes a gesture of friendship, and what a gesture! Hundreds of valuable goats and sheep and many cows, camels and bulls, delivered by Jacob’s servants make up the peace offering. Imagine Esau’s surprise upon seeing this display of generosity!<br>  Yet peace would cost even more. Face to face with Esau, what does Jacob now do? “And he himself passed on ahead of them and proceeded to bow down to the earth seven times until he got near to his brother,” doing this as if he were acknowledging someone superior. The effect? “And Esau went running to meet him, and he began to embrace him and fall upon his neck and kiss him, and they burst into tears.”—Genesis 32:13-15; 33:1-4.<br>  The lesson? In a personal dispute, there is something more important than who is “right” or “wrong.” It is important that peace be restored. So, when you’ve had a disagreement, ask yourself, “Am I seeing matters from his point of view? Have I handled matters in a Christian way? Am I willing to be humble? Can I be the first to say, ‘I’m sorry’ because of having caused someone else some embarrassment?”<br>  There’s a saying, “Sorry’s just a word.” But it is a powerful word. Try being the first to say it.—Matthew 5:9, 23, 24.<br>  <br>  <br>  PS: i fixed question 3

283tO9j9aa	If they still prefer sexual activity with another adult over porn, there's no problem. If the stuff they watch is just consenting adults (and humans only :P) and nobody is seriously hurt, there's no problem.<br>  <br>  Porn is a way for people to explore their fantasies without approaching their partners about it. Maybe they're embarrassed about something that turns them on, or they like to think about it but wouldn't do it for real. It doesn't mean they want a partner that looks like a porn star or that does all sorts of nasty things.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't consider watching porn to be abnormal or cheating. If it makes the other person uncomfortable a compromise can be reached, such as not watching it when the other person is around.<br>  <br>  Personally I don't like porn, the genitals are scary and the people are all ugly.

4b498f6e980fdc467d4a25698cc860f1aa	They are a great thing.  As somebody mentioned, what God has joined together cannot be pulled a part.  Now if God hasn't joined something together, then it shouldn't remain together as if it were joined by God.  Since the Catholic Church is the Bride of Christ, has the Keys to the Kingdom, and has the Holy Spirit, then the Church has the ability to discern, both by rationality as well as via the Holy Spirit what God has and what God has not joined together.<br>  <br>  That simple.  Praise be to the God who is still with us and leads His Church!  Else how could we know anything about God if He was not speaking to us?|`|AA11232725	I don't know about what Catholics consider to be justifiable to annul a marriage. All I know is that Jesus said what God has joined together let no man put asunder. The only exception Jesus made for divorce was marital infidelity. In 1 Cor 7 Paul said that if two believers can't get along they should seek to be reconciled and remain married until they do. I don't find anything in the Bible about an "annulment" of marriage.|`|26896be25b9fe83bcef7859a07b98f01aa	weeeeeellllll.... I've heard it said that it is far too easy to get an annulment in the Catholic Church in the United States.  I don't know what I think about that.<br>  <br>  The deal with annulments in the Catholic Church that makes it different from a "simple" divorce has to do with the sacrament of marriage.  That is a sacrament that is to be administered to a person only once in his or her life.  An annulment states that the original marriage (and therefore, the sacrament) was never valid, meaning that a key requirement or assumption was not present.  The idea is that if someone entered falsely into a marriage contract, the "innocent" party was not to be penalized for it.|`|0ad687dad9fee7ff3d8108550155e675aa	huh??????????????|`|2f8636add4ecffe37c8b83a78023a6a8aa	Not to offent any Catholics but I was one for 20+ years.

Then its DIVORCE, not annullment.|`|AA10117437	Yes!!!  It's ridiculous.  If you have enough money, anything's possible.

31158bc52a61a1292ced49abe58c3317aa	Good question!<br>  <br>  Neither... If I had a son or daughter that was doing wrong, I would not accept it as that would be condoning it, which is wrong. I wouldn't disown them either. I would love them, help them anyway I could to go down the right path, and even if they didn't, I would still love them. <br>  <br>  It's the same thing in our communities. I do volunteer work downtown with prostitutes and we try to let them know that we still care about them, that they are still loved, regardless of what they have chosen to do. We emphasize that we care about the person, the 'work' we do not agree with and will do what is needed to help them off the street, but we make sure they know they are cared about as people first, their work (prostitution) is an action not WHO they are. <br>  <br>  Love the sinner, hate the sin - and it's not always easy to actually put this into practice, trust me on this one.<br>  <br>  Through love and caring you will reach more people and help more people than by any form of violence.|`|37c1a9d0c658d42150fd75ead241de49aa	Hi! Would you throw away a dirty clothing or a dirty cup? I bet you don't..right? What you would do will be to wash it and then reuse it again.....I'm sure. Because it is the dirt that you want to discard and not the item. Well.....same to a human being. It is the deed that we should abhor and not the person. However, everyone of us will have to be answerable for our own deeds and actions and at the end of the day, we will be accountable for it therefore, we can only educate and admonish our wayward child, sibling or friend. There's nothing we can do if her/she chooses to become a black sheep but as long as we have done whatever we can to correct him/her, we have done our duties. We cannot change anybody's mindset if he/she doesn't want to make changes. The only way we could do is to live by example and hopefully he/she will come back to senses one day. Just a sharing......|`|462b78f4311608808a5064e9afb784d7aa	It would definitely depend on the level of respect.  It would take a lot for me to disown a child of mine, I really can't even comprehend it because I've never experienced anyone disrespect me to that extent.<br>  <br>  As for the religion context, it's like that old saying "love the sinner, hate the sin" - I think I would try to help the person.  If it comes to the point where I have to choose between helping a person out or saving my own sanity or sense of self-worth, that is when I have to stop but until then I think that it's definitely worthwhile to try to help someone through.|`|9bca00f3677f151769fea9a33560f34eaa	Jesus said to love one another.

But there were 2 of them on Pine street just down from Capitol Hill.  Only went to one of them.  It was good.  Then there was this really old one down in pioneer square.  Sorry my information is not more up to date.<br>  <br>  Are you in Seattle now?  I would think you'd be able to get information like this from all the free gay literature that is usually in coffee houses and gay bars.  Or get the yellow pages and look up "sauna" or "bath house".  A city like Seattle also would have a pink page directory.  Or check out the gay fun maps.  Just googled it.

52c6efd2a28acae483cd9a08949f7789aa	no, cursing has become part of everyday language.|`|73e47ce81b818b107ccb331b5ee0ff7baa	People curse to make them selfs look cool or to be noticed or they are hiding something about themselves and putting up a front<br>  I think it is not very professional|`|AA10117437	When I hear people curse I think "uneducated".  Of course, I curse all the time when I'm mad, but some people do it for no reason.  The words lose their effectiveness, then, and it seems like you are just too ignorant to think of real descriptive words to explain yourself.|`|e94efd5f05b010302880af91107220b5aa	People curse for the sake of getting rid of anger without exploding and breaking stuff.  It's a shame that they curse in front of others, but that's the toll it takes.  We simply pass on our anger to others because we can't handle it all on our own.  Of course, this changes with time, but it always seems to return also...that's what I think about it.  If we couldn't curse, I think the world would be a lot worse that it is now.  Still, it's up to ourselves to prevent it from happening.  I don't curse nearly as much as I used to, but I didn't stop completely.  To be honest, I don't think I ever can.  Something in the future is going to upset me, and I will probably curse about it.  Hope that helps!|`|ea86620ea71c0681d3083efe527f9358aa	Yeah they do!<br>  <br>  It's uncultured, uncivilized and unbecoming of any person. They speak foolishly with foolish words like water that flows from of a stream. That should give you an idea of what kinda stuff their minds are filled with!|`|4dd05b256bb73e7c41de13fbf41d05e6aa	The bad words are simply part of my vernacular.  I don't do it to impress my friends (since many of them refuse to curse at all).  And I try not to go overboard (I refrain from cursing in front of small children).  But is the occasional "damn" or other obscenity really that bad?|`|AA10832373	It depends on the situation. If the person's with other friends then they might think cursing would impress them. Sometimes it's just where they grow up and what vocabulary is used around them. Personally, when I hear someone cursing I think less of them. They might think it's cool, but it just makes them look bad and, like you said, stupid.|`|AA11200941	some of them, yes. peer pressure is the common reason.|`|AA12118082	Many do, as a way to "boost their ego".  <br>  <br>  I think it sounds stupid if you don't know the person and they are just "cursin" away.<br>  <br>  I know when I am with my 2 brothers though, we curse up a storm with each other (just not in front of the kids, we know better), it's just our way of talking with each other.  <br>  <br>  But to curse in public in general conversation is really rude, unless a safe drops on your foot or something...SH*T!!|`|AA12309059	Yeah- It does depend on the situation. If you are really mad, then it is because you are mad. If you just throw a few f words in here, and a h word in there, it's to make yourself look cool, which makes you sound completely idiotic.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	I think people swear because they aren't intelligent enough to think of properly descriptive words.
d5491f278e41eb08d6e9a671f7b7426faa	Why dream? Heavenly planets and hellish planets, as well as the Spiritual World are described in great detail in authorized Vedic scriptures of India. We do not have to dream to know what heaven and hell is like, we just have to find authoritative scripture or well-informed person (bonafide spiritual master) and read or hear carefully. <br>   have read about heaven and hell in Srimad Bhagavatam<br>  (you can read online at www.srimadbhagavatam.com, but I warn you that it is a very huge literature)|`|0249163da787200d3d72b053ece5a8cfaa	please visit these site and listen to people who have seen the reality of hell... www.freecdtracts.com<br>  look for divine revelation of hell and 23 minutes in hell.

2021c62da959fb83b78dad453cdce43aaa	From what we've been told, the people you see advertised on SDC are real, but may not be very active in the lifestyle.  <br>  <br>  What happens is SDC asks for permission from the people they think are really sexy to put their pictures up on the website. Consent is given and the pictures of the sexiest people are put up.  But those people may not stay active in the lifestyle, but the pictures and profiles are still available.
818cb06a54ddea43accdd20cff54cd3faa	pastor is comparable to the word shepherd.  a pastor guides and protects, by definition.  (teaching counts as guiding.)  a minister has a particular mission to accomplish.  a person who feeds the poor but never says a word about his religious beliefs is as much a minister as one who teaches.<br>  <br>  according to the bible, all christians should be ministers, but not all should be pastors.|`|4f50278773e4443646825a8545edb997aa	It depends on your denomination.  In Metropolitan Community Churches we believe in the priesthood of all believers, so, we would say that everyone is a priest and has a ministry (so, is a minister).    As for those who have professional occupations serving a community of faith, depending on the denominaiton they might be called a pastor, a minister, a priest, father, reverend.... it's kind of a long list!|`|f270975bf7535e5bfb366969331c422faa	I really dont know, however as long as The Word is spread and taught that is what is important.  Christ is all & in all......Be strong in the Lord.   God Bless|`|2bdabfd9bca2058f05ca541d6832273eaa	Hello. There is a slight difference. The word "minister means servant,it is a latin word. A Pastor is a minister of the gospel who has been ordained into the office of a Pastor.<br>  A minister on the other hand ,might not have been ordained in the manner the Pastor was.<br>  Every child of God is a Minister.

An example would be;  I went to the club and everybody and they grandma was there.|`|51050875b91801da8f93f163a0b76467aa	It just means a lot of people.|`|7d631c01cf0e5633e2dfbfb918c6300faa	I always said everyone and their brother, its better you should use that instead.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  A whole bunch of a lot of people|`|86aaa4351421f3bd66346839d535868faa	Its an exsevive amount of people.

A Metropolitan Community Church (www.mcchurch.org) or an Open and Affirming United Church of Christ.  OR, join the local chapter of the National Gay and Lesbian Task force or the National Center for Lesbian rights... all of these are, in my opinion, better than a bar!

Then the gentliles who began to follow Jesus didn't like the Jewish regulations, so, they split off.  That began a long history of the  followers of Jesus splitting over and over again, often over things Jesus said nothing at all about.
4f50278773e4443646825a8545edb997aa	Political Science (the science of politics) must take into consideration the population that politics serve.  In a nation where there is, even a large minority of people who believe in one theology or the other, polititions must at least appear to hear them (or lose).   In the United States Christianity in various forms has formed the values of many, many people (even those who do not go to any church).  Therefore, the science of politics, demands that we at least listen to those voices, and perhaps even afford those voices some power, in order to maintain our own.
4f50278773e4443646825a8545edb997aa	Gay<br>  Much commentary about this adjective referring to homosexuals exists, mostly having to do with usage. Our concern here, however, is etymology and two mistaken notions prevail. The first is that gay, meaning homosexual, originated as an acronym for Good As You. The second is that it is of relatively recent origin, dating only to the late 1960s. Both of these ideas are in error.<br>  <br>  Many, believe that gay came to mean homosexual only in the late 1960s with the Stonewall riot and the rise of the gay rights movement. This is not the case. The error these people are making is confusing the adoption of the term by the heterosexual community, and thus the English language as a whole, with its origin. The term is in fact much older, being used by homosexuals to refer to themselves with certainty as early as the 1920s, and possibly as early as the 1860s.<br>  <br>  Lighter gives the earliest usage cite as a 1922 quote from Gertrude Stein's "Miss Furr & Mrs. Skeene" which appeared in Vanity Fair. It is uncertain, however, if Stein's use of gay in this case is a reference to lesbianism or to the [then] conventional sense of gay meaning happy:<br>  <br>  They were ... gay, they learned little things that are things in being gay, ... they were quite regularly gay.<br>  The first unequivocal written use of gay to mean homosexual is in 1929, in Noel Coward's musical Bittersweet. In the song Green Carnation, four overdressed, 1890s dandies sing:<br>  <br>  Pretty boys, witty boys, You may sneer<br>  At our disintegration.<br>  Haughty boys, naughty boys,<br>  Dear, dear, dear!<br>  Swooning with affectation...<br>  And as we are the reason<br>  For the "Nineties" being gay,<br>  We all wear a green carnation.<br>  <br>  The penultimate line refers to the 1890s, which were commonly called the gay nineties. In general usage, this appellation had nothing to do with homosexuality, but in this context, Coward clearly uses it as a double entendre. <br>  <br>  Gay appears again in 1933 in Ford and Tyler's Young & Evil. In 1938 in the movie Bringing Up Baby, the character played by Cary Grant, when asked why he is wearing women's clothing replies, "Because I just went gay all of a sudden." In retrospect, this is obviously a joke intended to slip past the censors. In their 1941 book Sexual Variations, Gershon Legman and G.V. Henry cite gay as a slang term for homosexual, which indicates that it was in use for some time prior.<br>  <br>  Lighter also indirectly cites an 1868 song by female impersonator Will S. Hays titled, Gay Young Clerk in the Dry Goods Store. The lyrics do not explicitly link the word with homosexuality, but they can be interpreted that way, especially if sung by a man in drag. Then again, that may be reading too much into the lyrics. You be the judge:<br>  <br>  It's about a chap, perhaps you know,<br>  I'm told he is 'Nobody's beau,'<br>  But maybe you all knew that before,<br>  He's a lively clerk in a Dry-Goods Store.<br>  O! Augustus Dolphus is his name,<br>  From Skiddy-ma-dink they say he came,<br>  He's a handsome man and he's proud and poor,<br>  This gay young clerk in the Dry-Goods Store.<br>  OK, so gay was definitely in use in the 1920s, and perhaps earlier, but how did the term come to be associated with homosexuals? Several possibilities exist, but the acronym for Good As You is not one of them. <br>  The most likely explanation is that it derives from gaycat or geycat, a slang term for a tramp or hobo who is new to the road. Gaycats were commonly in the company of older tramps, implying a homosexual relationship. The term, according to Lighter, dates to at least the 1890s. Gaycats were employed as lookouts while other hoboes committed crimes. The OED2 cites the 1935 Underworld & Prison Slang by N. Ersine as defining geycat as a homosexual boy. The origin of gaycat is unknown. Green, however, says a gay cat was a tramp who offered sexual services to women.<br>  <br>  Another possible origin is the late nineteenth century slang usage of gay to mean promiscuous. A gay house meant a brothel. This sexual sense of the term could have become associated with homosexual promiscuity and the heterosexual sense lost.

5c9011543d498dda04d1562813072559aa	I'm not sure of the exact number of translations there are out there. Yes, the different Bible translations can be confusing—but I hope you won't give up. The Bible was originally written in the ancient languages of Hebrew and Greek, and I'm grateful for the dedicated translators who have made it available to us in modern English. Our language has changed over the years, and that's one reason for new translations. God wants us to understand His Word, and a good translation can help us do that. God told His prophet to "write down the revelation and make it plain" (Habakkuk 2:2).<br>  <br>  A good translation should be both accurate and easy to understand; take time to sample some of them by reading the same passage in several different versions. Your pastor or Christian bookstore should be able to help you choose the right one for you. In this column I usually quote from the New International Version, which is the most widely used modern translation.<br>  <br>  No matter which translation you use, however, the most important thing is your attitude. Do you see the Bible as God's Word, and are you listening to it with an obedient spirit? The Bible says, "Do not merely listen to the word. ... Do what it says" (James 1:22).|`|ccd7788c2b6d6cd815972a1872ff350caa	There is only one that is the True word of the living God and that is the King James Version Bible....The Holy Spirit authorized Bible.|`|0fa7a57282521e79beb8d78571a64f9eaa	Quote by Michael Shermer that there are "more unique copies of the bible than there are words in the New Testement."<br>  <br>  Editor of Skeptic Magazine and he knows what he's talking about.|`|12fec527239b3a8848cb6e90e29ad468aa	Hard to day.

AA12226501	Swingers are people who are in a relationship but have sex with others. However, they have the consent of their partners so that it isn't considered cheating. <br>  As a single female, you could be sexually involved with one or both of the partners if you're unattached or you and/or your partner could be sexually involved with one or more other people with consent if you are in a relationship.<br>  I'm sure that the common definition of a swinger must have changed since the word was originated, and there are still differences of opinion as to what exactly constitutes being a swinger.|`|2021c62da959fb83b78dad453cdce43aaa	I got most of this information from Wikipedia and it is all correct.  We have been swinging for about 6 years now and we really enjoy it.  If you have any other questions, please feel free to IM or email us.  We'd be happy to help.<br>  <br>  <br>  Swinging activities can include (but are not limited to):<br>  <br>  Exhibitionism: having sex with a partner while being watched. <br>  <br>  Voyeurism: watching others have sex (perhaps with the above mentioned partner). <br>  <br>  Soft Swinging or Soft Swap: kissing, stroking, or having oral sex with a third or fourth person. This may be in the form of a threesome or group sex, or partners may literally be swapped. <br>  <br>  Full Swap: having penetrative sex with someone other than one's partner, which is the commonly understood definition of swinging (though not necessarily the most common type). <br>  <br>  Group Sex: An all inclusive term for activities involving multiple partners in the same vicinity. <br>  <br>  Typically, swinging activities occur when a married or otherwise committed couple engages with either another couple, multiple couples, or a single individual. These acts can occur in the same room (often called same room swinging) though different or separate room swinging does occur. Sex on these occasions is often referred to as play.<br>  <br>  While the vast majority of swingers are heterosexual couples, a major part of Lifestyle activities are bisexual in nature. A large portion of female swingers, while they may or may not identify as bisexual, are interested in female-female sexual contact. Male-male contact is very rare, and usually frowned upon at a Swing Club/Party.<br>  <br>  Female bisexuality and bicurious is extremely common in both the urban and traditional swinging scene and tends to be the norm amongst participants. No studies have been conducted as to what percentage of swinging women who define themselves as bisexual would be open to romantic as well as sexual relations with both genders.<br>  <br>  Male bisexuality is less common in the swinging scene, but is becoming more common and more accepted. More openly bi men and bisexual couples (male-female couples where both partners are bisexual) are appearing on the scene. Whether this is due to increasing acceptance in the scene or greater numbers of men "turning bi" is open to discussion. Depending on the club or social situation, male bisexuality among swingers may either be frowned upon, or openly accepted.<br>  <br>  The acceptance of singles at swinging events varies from geographic area to geographic area. Some swinging 'clubs' have a policy of allowing only couples and females, but most do allow single men on selected nights. Single females are often admitted at reduced admission price. Parties and private events may differ, however, and are often restricted to couples or couples and single females only.<br>  <br>  The reasons for this vary. Most (but certainly not all) of the people who pay to participate in swinger events are male-female couples and most swinging couples are more interested in interacting with other couples or with single women than with single men. Thus, swinger events strive to achieve a balance between male and female participants or have a (usually slightly) larger number of females than males.<br>  <br>  A common complaint among swingers is that single men change the tone and nature of event. While outright hostility towards single men is rarely prevalent, an abundance of single males is rarely looked upon favourably in any swinging context. When single males are permitted their numbers are usually limited by high entrance fees or stringent membership requirements.<br>  <br>  Some swingers oppose the involvement of any singles of either sex in swinging because of the fear that they might split existing couples. While this might be a fear of some new couples, couples who have been part of the "Lifestyle" for some time report that the only way a couple can "split" is when one of the couple is looking outside the primary relationship. This is not the norm in a swinger relationship.|`|0a3fcceae753705cedc09eee5cc03459aa	A Swinger is Bi-Sexual.

When only love exists in your mind then that is all you will be able to spread.|`|4ad6a7f470fb8f4bdec1b570b581496baa	First let me say that I agree completely with the point that we must all learn to accept eachother's religion, beliefs etc.  The hatred is unacceptable and will probably lead to the end of humanity in the future.<br>  However, although your point is well taken, I think you are looking at society-not religion.  Fundamentalists are in every religion but it is the society of today that allows/helps them to become terroristic (yup, thats now a word!).  It is not the religion itself-only the people of today.  I think that every religion-besides Satanic worship- (just to let you know, I am NOT referring to paganistic worship-only satanism- aka worshipping evil) is basically good. Any one who believes is only trying to find faith and hope in something other than ourselves. It a way to have the strength to go on in the hardest of times.  That is what spirituality is all about.  <br>  I think that the problems you are talking about is not due to the religion, therefore, but the society.  We use religious beliefs against eachother, when in reality, all religions stem from eachother.  Islam accepts Christianity-and Christianity accepts Islam-the believers however, do not accept eachother. The actual religion has nothing to do with it.  Allowing Fundamentalists to interpret thier religion in what ever suits them best for the time being or for what ever cause they want to justify is what makes for problems. <br>  People just need to get an education and help extremists become rational-whether the extremists are Catholic, Christian, Wiccan, Jewish, Muslim, etc.  It doesnt matter-we all just need to take responsibility for our own beliefs and not try to justify them with a religion.|`|901006221c760c0f1503f16c175a228aaa	I could not agree with you more.  <br>  <br>  The old testiment is used by both sects.  In Islam, Abraham is Ibrahim, but they are the same.  It seems that the two groups are split decendants of a once unified line.<br>  <br>  It reminds me of a fued, like you would have in the backwoods of kentucky that has carried on for so long that they have forgotten what they are fighting for, they just know they are fighting.  And since they grew up only knowing the fight, it is hard for them to imagine a peace.<br>  <br>  Having wide experience with many religions.  I learned Christianity from my mother, and Islam from my father.  I learned Bushism, Hinduism and Shintoism from frieinds and reading.<br>  <br>  The one thing that is a golden thread through all is that we should love one another.  In order to get there we need a common goal for the world to focus on.<br>  <br>  And since it is inevitible that this planet will be inhabitable someday, maybe we should come togehter in a unified effort towards the colonizatoin of space, and the continuation of the human species, after all if we don't want to work together we all prescribe to die togetther.|`|9b5c4d1fa255bc5fac5ffbde9e537805aa	Good advice...|`|f88bfaf37d4981e794d0a5a9f77656edaa	Love without truth is not love|`|f8f68be88ac6b89b69dc613644fcf2fcaa	I am a Christian (Roman Catholic).

You have to stereotype, I hate how people try and make that a bad word.  You judge and stereotype all the time, and, if you physically can't, you're diagnosed with autism.|`|f2df44c8c9660c07d1cda8426cf487c1aa	people judge them because the term "emo" has been stereotyped. just like how pirates are hook-handed greedy assholes in the same way that emos are depressed dramaqueens. black is dominant in emo dress but patterns are acceptable as long as they're either black/white or red or just really really "deep". <br>  but no matter how you dress just remember: you're not a true emo unless you cut yourself and listen to sad music.

Honestly, I prefer the old way of doing things and would "honor" the wedding couple when they formally announce their marriage. How they were married is of little significance.<br>  <br>  If, after a weekend of heavy hoo-haas, they pop in and announce they got married, say "congratulations" and let it go at that. If they plan a reception, or send formal announcements....reciprocate with a gift.

I suppose that's a more enticing name than "The guy with lots of lumps on him".  At one time he had a loose piece of flesh dangling from his upper jaw (or lip) that looked something like a tiny trunk, but it was surgically removed before he started his sideshow career.  A pamphlet sold at his how claimed his deformity was caused by his mother being frightened by a circus elephant when she was expecting him.  Now it's believed he had a disease called Proteus syndrome.|`|eac07219937a4c20a727e50b1277b787aa	because he was a side-show in a carnival, and that's what they called him (half of him looked like an elephant, i guess... like, big hand, big foot, non-human face..)

They are not true.  I fell for the lie myself and spent 8 years being miserable and hating life.  You are not gay.  You must speak this truth over yourself every time these feelings surface.  I have come through it and my attractions toward men have returned and I'm so much happier.  It is overwhelming to feel that way, but you have to fight it.  Don't let yourself believe the lie or it will eat you alive.|`|5db661aa7c4e9f42fa8139651a98c24caa	The last question is most telling:  "How do I decide what to do with my life?"<br>  <br>  Listen - your feelings (desires) follow what you give your attention to.  Medical science and psychologists and many gay people think just the opposite....that you give your attention to what you naturally desire.  (Hence the assumption that people are "born" gay or they are that way "naturally" and can't help it.)<br>  <br>  Horsehocky!  If you want to be straight, start thinking about girls and give them your attention.....if you want to be gay, then think about men in a sexual way.  (Thinking about having sex with other men doesn't come as naturally as you think though....why is pornography such a "norm" in gay circles?  Because people have to literally PROGRAM themselves to be gay!)  <br>  <br>  However, being homosexual is a highly risk lifestyle that usually leads to early demise....(think AIDS here).  There is also a lot of social stigma even now....although the greatest conflict you'll have won't be from the people around you who can't accept you "being gay"...it will be the conflict within yourself since you're basically having to deaden yourself to the way God created you naturally....to be attracted to the opposite sex!<br>  <br>  People get really mad when I tell them they have the freedom to choose and how easy it is to change their desires.  But that sounds very freeing to me, and I would much rather realize that I truly DO have freedom and choices in my life....including sexual orientation, rather than having those things imposed upon me and then told I have no other choices.   In other words, I'm saying you can be the victor, or the victim in your life.  BUT YOU GET TO CHOOSE!<br>  <br>  SO, to answer your original question:  How do I decide?  You just give your attention in the direction you want your life to go in.  The desires will follow.  Choose wisely, it's the only life you got!  But isn't it great to know you can truly make it WHATEVER YOU WANT IT TO BE???????????????/<br>  <br>  Wishing you all the best -|`|1c898821ebce454e5d358837f41c158eaa	"(Thinking about having sex with other men doesn't come as naturally as you think though....why is pornography such a "norm" in gay circles?

Fantasising about men comes naturally as heterosexual fantasising. Where the hell are you getting your ideas from?<br>  <br>  Why do you think porn is such a norm for heterosexual men? <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  And markie darl.

If you hit your thumb with a hammer when great aunt Edith is in the room what do you say? It's probably going to be a minced oath. <br>  <br>  They are usually, although not exclusively, religious in nature and date from the days when it wasn't acceptable to use the name of God, Jesus or other religious notables in everyday speech. To mince your words, or mince matters, means to choose words so as not to offend anyone. Some example are 'Jiminy Cricket' (Jesus Christ), 'dagnamit' (God damn it'), 'for Pete's sake' (for St. Peter's sake).|`|69198150fe437ac3d5f5dcdddb89de6caa	Howzat? It's a cricket for God's sake.

sxUMWkOnaa	The literal meaning I don't know it's description is a rolled up piece of parchment on which is written a paragraph of the shma (from the torah) and which is repeated by Jews twice a day and affirms our belief in God. It is placed inside a holder and fixed on the side of the doors in a Jewish household. It's purpose is to be there and in return God will protect for obeying the commandments|`|AA11665182	I can tell U this Its nothing holy about it. and it doesn't deal with JESUS|`|AA11690977	The Mezuzah is a peice of parchment with a prayer written on it, placed in a box, and the box affixed to the door post.  When passing through a doorway with a mezuzah, some Jews touch the mezuzah and kiss their fingers, as an expression of devotion to Torah. This custom originated as a result of a story brought down in the Talmud where a convert to Judaism converted a number of Caesar's soldiers to Judaism.|`|PaCpvX5maa	Kum by ya my Lord, kum by ya<br>  Kum by ya my Lord, kum by ya<br>  Kum by ya my Lord, kum by ya<br>  Oh, Lord kum by ya.<br>  Someone’s crying Lord, kum by ya<br>  Someone’s praying Lord, kum by ya|`|AA11439912	On the doorposts of traditional Jewish homes (and many not-so-traditional homes!), you will find a small case like the one pictured at left. This case is commonly known as a mezuzah (Heb.: doorpost), because it is placed upon the doorposts of the house. The mezuzah is not, as some suppose, a good-luck charm, nor does it have any connection with the lamb's blood placed on the doorposts in Egypt. Rather, it is a constant reminder of G-d's presence and G-d's mitzvot. <br>  <br>  The mitzvah to place mezuzot on the doorposts of our houses is derived from Deut. 6:4-9, a passage commonly known as the Shema (Hear, from the first word of the passage). In that passage, G-d commands us to keep His words constantly in our minds and in our hearts, by (among other things) writing them on the doorposts of our house. The words of the Shema are written on a tiny scroll of parchment, along with the words of a companion passage, Deut. 11:13-21. On the back of the scroll, a name of G-d is written. The scroll is then rolled up placed in the case, so that the first letter of the Name (the letter Shin) is visible (or, more commonly, the letter Shin is written on the outside of the case). <br>  <br>  The scroll must be handwritten in a special style of writing and must be placed in the case to fulfill the mitzvah. It is commonplace for gift shops to sell cases without scrolls, or with mechanically printed scrolls, because a proper scroll costs more than even an elaborately decorated case ($30-$50 for a valid scroll is quite reasonable). According to traditional authorities, mechanically printed scrolls do not fulfill the mitzvah of the mezuzah, nor does an empty case. <br>  <br>  The case and scroll are then nailed or affixed to the right side doorpost on an angle, with a small ceremony called Chanukkat Ha-Bayit (dedication of the house - yes, this is the same word as Chanukkah, the holiday celebrating the rededication of the Temple after the Maccabean revolt against Greece). A brief blessing is recited. See the text of the blessing at Affixing the Mezuzah. <br>  <br>  Why is the mezuzah affixed at an angle? The rabbis could not decide whether it should be placed horizontally or vertically, so they compromised! <br>  <br>  Every time you pass through a door with a mezuzah on it, you touch the mezuzah and then kiss the fingers that touched it, expressing love and respect for G-d and his mitzvot and reminding yourself of the mitzvot contained within them. <br>  <br>  It is proper to remove a mezuzah when you move, and in fact, it is usually recommended. If you leave it in place, the subsequent owner may treat it with disrespect, and this is a grave sin. I have seen many mezuzot in apartment complexes that have been painted over by subsequent owners, and it breaks my heart every time I see that sort of disrespect to an object of religious significance. <br>  <br>  For more information about mezuzot or to purchase valid scrolls for a mezuzah online, visit the S.T.A.M. website.|`|e9ac3f47dd3d413181661caa41c44562aa	That's the thing that hangs on the door, right, and has the torah passage on a little scroll?<br>  <br>  I think that that's supposed to remind people leaving/entering the house that they should heed god at all times and it is kind of like the passover blood.

WJD3bVH0aa	Actually, only the "aka" in Akamaru (赤丸) means "red". "Maru" means "full, perfect, circle", but was also used in the names of Japanese warships, so it's become a name ending.<br>  <br>  As for Deidara, it seems that his name is derived from a mythological Japanese character named Deidarabocchi, a giant who carried Mt. Fuji on his back and created lakes with his footprints. There is no guarantee to the exact meaning of the name "Deidara" (デイダラ) or "Deidarabocchi" (でいだらぼっち), because every source I found only wrote the names in kana. Kana can have meaning, but there is no way to be sure of the meaning unless the name is written in kanji.<br>  <br>  I'll link a couple interesting (English) sources, and hope it helps. :)|`|ttZWvp1qaa	akamaru means red circle. not just a red.<br>  <br>  about deidara...<br>  other poster's ans is good.<br>  deidara bocchi is just a name.<br>  express the image of huge, gigantic

WJD3bVH0aa	I have no idea what people are answering with... maybe they're using Babel Fish or something?<br>  <br>  There are a few different ways to say "ask out". The most common one has the word "date" in it:<br>  <br>  [person]をデートに誘う<br>  [person] o deeto ni sasou<br>  <br>  So "ask him out" would be "Kare o deeto ni sasou", or "Kare o deeto ni sasoimasu" in polite speech.<br>  <br>  デートする (deeto suru) is pretty direct - you can ask someone デートしてくれますか? (deeto shite kuremasu ka?) - essentially "Will you go on a date with me?"<br>  <br>  There's also 招待する (shoutai suru), but this is more in the sense of inviting someone somewhere, not necessarily on a date.<br>  <br>  デート (deeto) is really the only word used for the noun "date".|`|AA10754087	Well here's the regular English alphabet.<br>  <br>  Aigansuru kare-o rusu. Hizuke, kazuke, o:se, and de:tsu all refer to the dates you all go out on whether it's boys dating girls or girls dating boys. De:to means to date and nengappi, nendai, and natsumeyashi all refer to the calendar dates because the Japanese word for year that's so close to nengappi and nendai is nendo, but I say it as toshi anyways. I believe that de:tsu can refer to both by the way because it sounds more like date in English and don't forget the date fruit.

Today, some of the prejudice still lingers -- some straight men are turned on by two women making love because ultimatly he sees it as for his pleasure - he owns, has dominion, over all women. women making love does not threaten his power.   Gay men having sex is (to some staight persons) a man giving up his power and acting like a woman, like a subordinate.  A man giving up his power is a sin, a woman using her sexual power while a man is watching is sexy.   UG|`|a9059da34713cf1fa2b13f04a97e06c1aa	It's because two women together aren't seen as a couple.

Basically, American society was started by men, about men, and for men. I don't need to give you the history lesson about women's civil rights I'm sure. It's obvious that masculine ideas and concepts have dominated our society (that men should be in control, women should be submissive). Because of these feelings, it has always been assumed that a man should be the strong one in a relationship and a woman should be the "weaker," submissive one. <br>  <br>  When two women are in a relationship, the idea of a "strong man" is thrown out of the window, mainly because no male is present. To be sure, it might even be comforting to see if there is somewhat of a masculine woman, because it relieves men to see that some women want to fit the role of the man, i.e., be more like men.<br>  <br>  But, when you have two men together, there is the pre-conceived notion that they are both engaging in anal sex, which is true for a majority, but not all homosexual relationships. Thus, when straight men and women (who have traditionally thought of love as "between a man and a woman") think of one of the men as being a receptive, submissive partner (especially within the anus, which many people think is gross to begin with), the straight people think of the relationship as disgusting. As said before, for two reasons:<br>  <br>  1) Anal sex is thought to occur, which is unsettling to many<br>  2) Furthermore, a man is a willing receptive partner, which further disgusts some and is also seen as an outrage to many men, their belief being that ALL men should be the active, strong partner in a relationship<br>  <br>  In essence, people just think it's baffling when there's a lesbian relationship (How do they actually do it?), whereas many think gay male relationships are revolting because of a combination of differentiated gender roles and sexual acts.<br>  <br>  Hopefully this has helped you, sorry if I seem a little incoherent.|`|EIrdLq6Zaa	I believe so. There still is unfortunately a stigma attached to men  together in public, especially if they're older. Everyone has seen two women dancing together, sitting at a restaurant together, walking down the street holding hands even kissing or showing public affection. It rarely turns a head; however, two men doing these would get  stares, comments even name calling. Take these comments back a number of years.<br>  <br>  If you saw a black and white mixed couple they got the same reaction from both races. We've come a long way but it is more acceptable now than it was years ago.|`|ibbz6NrVaa	Women a generally more acceptable than men. Be they gay, lesbian or heterosexual. t

e855599e3cb6ff96d617e5c785648ac2aa	La risposta più logica e sensata è questa:<br>  La Bibbia insegna la dottrina della creazione ordinata di Dio, il che significa che Dio ha fatto ogni creatura "secondo la sua specie": Egli creò le varie specie e poi li lasciò sviluppare e progredire secondo le leggi da lui stesso stabilite. La distinzione tra l'uomo e le creature inferiori è implicità nell'affermazione che "Dio creò l'uomo a sua immagine".<br>  La teoria dell'evoluzione si oppone alla creazione ordinata per specie, perché essa insegna che tutte le forme di vita si svilupparono da una sola forma e che le specie più elevate si svilupparono da quelle inferiori; ad esempio: ciò che una volta era una lumaca è divenuto un pesce evolvendo in un rettile evolvendo ancora in un ucello, per farla breve, ciò che era una scimmia è divenuto un essere umano.<br>  La teoria è la seguente: Nel passato più remoto apparvero la materia e l'energia, come e quando la scienza non lo sa. Tra la materia e l'energia apparve una cellula di vita, da dove nessuno lo sa. In questa cellula vi era una scintilla di vita: da questa cellula originale hanno avuto origine tutte le cose viventi, dai vegetali all'uomo, il cui sviluppo è stato controllato dalle leggi inerenti. Queste leggi, unite alle condizioni circostanti, spiegano le varie specie venute in essere e che ora esistono, l'uomo compreso.<br>  Secondo questa teoria vi è una continua e graduale ascesa dalle forme più basse di vita alle più alte, fino a raggiungere l'uomo.<br>  Ora quando  leggiamo che Dio ha fatto ogni creatura secondo la sua specie, significa che Dio le ha fatte incapaci di formare varietà di altra specie e che Egli ha fatto ogni specie distinta e separata, ha messo tra queste come una barriera; cosicché, ad esempio, un cavallo non si svilupperà mai in modo da produrre una razza di creature che non si possano più chiamare cavalli.<br>  Qual è la prova attraverso la quale si possono distinguere le specie? Questa: Se gli animali possono riprodurre una feconda progenie, essi sono della stessa specie; altrimenti, no. Ad esempio, i cavalli e gli asini sono di specie diversa, perché, sebbene incrociandosi essi generino il mulo, un mulo non può generare un'altro mulo e produre così una specie di muli. Questo fatto si oppone alla teoria dell'evoluzione, perché mostra chiaramente che Dio ha messo una barriera ad impedire che una specie si sviluppa in un'altra.<br>  <br>  Concludo con la dichiarazione del dott. Coppens:<br>  "Sebbene gli scienziati lavorino da molti anni esplorando terre e mari, esaminando i residui fossili di innumerivoli specie di piante e di animali ed impiegano tutto il genio inventivo dell'uomo per ottenere, e perpetuare, nuove varietà e razze, non hanno mai potuto mostrare una sola prova decisiva dell'avvenuta trasformazione di specie. Gli animali sono oggi quelli rappresentati sulle piramidi, come quelli mummificati nelle tombe d'egitto e come erano prima che lasciassero le loro forme fossili nelle rocce. Molte specie si sono estinte, se ne sono trovate altre delle qualli non sono stati trovati esemplari molto antichi; ma non può essere provato che una specie si sia evoluta in un'altra".|`|4a45d3d10c5bd1cc9a0cf9e908341568aa	per primo volevo ringraziarti della domanda, posta finalmente in maniera intelligente e costruttiva, forse un po arrogante, ma di grosso impatto!<br>  per risponderti...è vero non conosciamo cosa ci sia stato prima del brodo primordiale, ma sappiamo quello che c'è stato dopo; lo stesso big bang è stato solo ipotizzato, dal rilevamento di radiazione di fondo e di sciami di particelle elementari sparpagliati per l'universo (che ancora non sappiamo se statico o dinamico, o se ancora in espansione o implosione)...non sappiamo molte cose, abbimo molti buchi nella nostra conscienza, ma ci stiamo impegnando per colmarli....e poi se sapessimo gia tutto ci sarebbero un sacco di ricercatori a spasso...<br>  ancora complimenti per la perspicacita!|`|9bd483ed26228f2d38b057882dbdfe6eaa	A parte il tuo tono, in verità un poco sprezzante e a mio avviso poco educato, vorrei ricordarti che se Atene piange,( e nemmeno tanto) Sparta non ride: l'esistenza di dio, cosa di cui tutti i credenti sono assolutamente certi, non è ancora stata dimostrata.<br>  A differenza della religione, la scienza è dinamica, si evolve per sua natura. In essa, cioè, una teoria è valida fino a quando non se ne trova una migliore, ossia una che spieghi il fenomeno preso in esame in maniera più approfondita di quella precedente.Questo nella religione -per ovvi motivi -non accade. <br>  Se tu hai una teoria migliore di quella di Darwin, nulla ti vieta di esporla; ma la devi anche dimostrare. Affermare che la natura, il cosmo, l'universo abbiano origini divine è una ipotesi: che però -come sai - nessuno ha mai dimostrato.<br>  Difatti, tutte le religioni sono accomunate da due cose: tutte dicono di essere la sola ad avere ragione, ma nessuna porta le prove.<br>  <br>  per parlare poi del big bang, che tu hai accennato qui, e per farla molto breve ( visto che di certo puoi trovare testi che trattano questo argomento in maniera molto più dettagliata di quanto stia per fare io adesso), tu poni una domanda lecita, ossia:cosa c'era prima del Big bang.<br>  A questa domanda ti si può rispondere in due modi:<br>  <br>  "Prima" non c'era niente...non ha senso chiedersi cosa vi sia stato prima, perchè il tempo è nato con il Big bang. Chiedersi cosa ci sia prima del tempo è una domanda assai simile a quella che parecchie persone si facevano tempo fa, ossia "cosa faceva dio prima di creare il mondo?"<br>  La risposta che si dava a questa domanda, però, evidenzia una concezione della culture profondamente diversa da un vero atteggiamento scientifico, che per sua natura è aperto.<br>  difatti, la risposta più comune era: "preparava l'inferno per coloro che fanno domande simili".<br>  <br>  la seconda risposta a questa domanda   -cosa vi fosse prima delò big bang, lo ripeto per comodità - è un pò più articolata, e mi auguro di essere all'altezza di spiegartela.<br>  Dunque, il Big bang è una grande esplosione...quindi una grande decompressione.<br>  Molte teorie affermano che l'universo alterni fasi cicliche eterne di Big bang (esplosione e quindi decompressione) e Big Crunch (pressione)..non so se mi sono spiegato bene.<br>  <br>  Senza poi scomodare l'astrofisica, questa idea era comune -anche se espressa in termini molto diversi - persino nell'antichità.<br>  sicuramente avrai sentito parlare di Parmenide, l'oscuro filosofo greco che affermava la celebre ed apparentemente incomprensibile frase: "L'essere è e il non essere non è".<br>  <br>  Ora, se al posto di "essere" tu sostiuisci uno dei sinonimi che il termine greco "eon" ( che non posso scrivere in greco qui, purtroppo) ha tra i suoi significati, ossia "spazio", avrai che la frase può essere resa come."le propietà dello spazio sono immutabili" Vale a dire -ad esempio- che un triangolo per quanto grande o piccolo sia, avrà sempre gli angoli che assomati danno 180 gradi.<br>  E se al posto di spazio, sostituisci uno dei sinonimi di "essere" ossia "materia" avrai un concetto -comune alla fisica quantistica - che la materia è sempre esistita. Inoltre, per usare un concetto della fisica quantistica, la materia altro non è che energia, e la nostra corporeità è illusoria.<br>  <br>  questo concetto è ancora più difficile da afferrare, ma posso farti un esempio:<br>  <br>  Supponi di non avere mai visto una matita. e supponi che io sia ora davanti a te ed inizi ad agitare una matita molto velocemente davanti ai tuoi occhi.Ora, tu -non avendo mai visto una matita - se provi a passare attraverso quella specie di "muro" che pare prodursi dalla velocità del mio movimento, potresti pensare che esso sia solido e largo, perchè andresti sempre ad urtare un tuo dito contro la matita, che però non vedresti perchè si muove velocemente.<br>  <br>  gli atomi -per farla molto, molto semplice, sono come la mia matita, con la differenza che anche loro sono pura energia, e la loro corporeità è data solo dalla velocità. per questo, non si può sapere contemporaneamente dove sia un quark -una parte di un atomo - e  a quale velocità vada.<br>  <br>  Mi rendo conto che l'argomento è molto dificile, ed io di certo  non sono uno sceinziato come Einstein dotato delle qualità necessarie per spiegartelo; ma forse sono riuscito a farti vedere qualcosa.<br>  <br>  Inoltre, mi pare che queste teorie siano più valide e comunque più documentate di quanto ad esempio troviamo nella Bibbia: in essa vi si afferma che dio creò il mondo e tutte le specie così come esse esistano ( il che è falso) nel 9000 a. C. ( secondo calcoli basati su di essa ed effettuati da alcuni teologi, calcoli che però sono falsi, perchè la terra ha 4,5 miliardi di anni).<br>  <br>  E' insomma grazie alla scienza che -come diceva Galieli, provando e riprovando, siamo riusciti ad andare avanti con la comprensione dell'universo. Ed è indicativo il fatto che Galilei venne condannato all'abiura dallo stesso uomo che mise a morte Giordano Bruno per aver affermato che l'universo è infinito: sto parlando di Roberto Bellarmino, dottore della chiesa, santo, inquisitore ed assassino.<br>  un esempio-fra i molti nella storia- di come la religione abbia da sempre avversato la conoscienza.saluti.|`|ULr07fktaa	non lo so.<br>  <br>  ps: è inutile che spolliciate, aspiranti scienziati e ferventi religiosi: nessuno di voi lo sa per certo. Nessuno. Le "teorie" (il tempo che si crea col big-bang, il big crunch etc etc)valgono quanto i dogmi. Il bello dello scienziato, caro il mio provocatore da 4 soldi, è CHE HA DEI DUBBI E SI PONE DOMANDE, il che non vuol dire che abbia le risposte ma è già più avanti di te che stai fermo sulle tue convinzioni infondate.|`|ad6559518ee7ea2663bbb774b8106390aa	Il problema dell'inutile accanimento fra religione e scienza va trovato nella premessa che impostiamo all’inizio del nostro dibattito.<br>  <br>  Se parto dalla premessa che esiste un'entita' sovrannaturale, onnipotente, cosciente, e quindi in possesso di intelligenza, volonta' bonta', amore, compassione, desiderio che esisteva prima dell'esistenza della materia e dell'energia e se affermo di essere certo che tale entita' debba necessariamente esistere per spiegare l'esistenza dell'universo e della vita in esso, allora seguo il pensiero mistico-religioso che si basa sulla fede.<br>  <br>  Se parto invece dalla premessa che per essere intellettualmente onesto devo spiegare tutto quello che mi circonda secondo le leggi imposte dalla natura e quindi secondo l'osservazione sperimentale, seguo il pensiero dello scienziato o dell'investigatore.  Lo scienziato non e' cosi arrogante da SAPERE la conclusione di tutto A PRIORI, per mezzo della fede.  Un investigatore di un un crimine non oserebbe dire tu sei colpevole perche’ Dio me lo dice!  Lo scienziato si limita a parlare solo di cio' che e' evidente ai sensi e quindi dismostrabile per logica.  La logica, per essere valida, non deve mai contraddire la realta' dei fatti. Lo scienziato e l’investigatore onesto se non ha prove non le inventa.  Dice semplicemente che non puo’ rispondere a una domanda se NON C’E’ SUFICIENTE EVIDENZA.  Solo cosi si arriva alla giustizia e alla verita.’<br>  <br>  Le emozioni come i desideri, le speranze, la fede possono farci credere tutto quello che vogliamo.  Possiamo credere in cose contradditorie e fantastiche con le emozioni, ma non possimo farlo con la ragione logica.<br>  <br>  Ecco perche' lo scienziato e' tipicamente intellettualmente piu' onesto del religioso.  Il religioso e' vittima delle sue emozioni, VUOLE CHE LA REALTA’ SI ADEGUI ALLA SUA FEDE.<br>  <br>  Dire che l'universo ha uno scopo e che noi siamo la cosa piu' importante in esso e che una divinita' si preoccupa di noi e della nostra vita, non ha nessuna correlazione con l'evidenza dei sensi e con l'osservazione scientifica dell'universo che l'uomo ha fatto fin dall'inizio della civilta'. Sono belle parole frutto di speranze, sentimenti o desideri ma non di realta' osservabili. Per questo che tra il creazionismo e l'evoluzionismo c'e' un abisso invalicabile. Un concetto esclude l'altro.<br>  <br>  O Dio e' un essere sovrannaturale e puo' fare qualsiasi cosa, qualsiasi miracolo, anche contro natura, o Dio e' un concetto privo di senso e uno puo' benissimo sostituire quella parola con natura, realta' esistenza. <br>  <br>  Il concetto di Dio implica coscienza, volonta', emotivitita'. Chi ci crede pensa che Dio si arrabbi se noi non lo ubbidiamo, che Dio si compiace se facciamo quello che Egli vuole da noi, che Dio ci protegge, si occupa di noi e che ha una relazione cosciente con noi. Se crediamo, gli parliamo e Egli ci risponde nelle nostre preghiere.<br>  <br>  La natura, invece, non ha coscienza. La natura e' indifferente a noi. La natura segue leggi precise e prevedibili. Non ci sono miracoli, ci sono solo cause ed effetti che con lo studio e l'onesta' intellettuale possono essere comprese ed usate a nostro beneficio. Come Francis Bacon disse, se vogliamo comandare la natura dobbiamo ubbidire alle sue leggi.<br>  <br>  Chi dei due e' piu' intellettualmente onesto: chi ASEERISCE che il sovrannaturale esiste senza averne le minime prove o chi accetta di affermare solo cio' che puo' comprendere con la sua mente senza mai osare di contraddire le leggi della natura?|`|fae755a103e48959ee7ab6a1f71e3542aa	La differenza fra uno scienziato che dice che prima del bigbang c'era energia e ke questa è sempre esistita, rispetto a uno che dice ke cè Dio da sempre e ke è sempre esistito è ke entrambi non dicono nulla ma il primo almeno non ti obbliga a credere nelle sue ipotesi che non fa passare per dogmi.|`|4Z0FoZZWaa	ma come???da dove ha origine???da dove inizia???Inizia da un mucchio di gente che non ha niente da fare nella vita che sprecare tempo a capire perché siamo qui invece di vivere la vita al presente senza pensare al passato e che oltretutto manco si può limitare a tenersela per se e per i suoi amichetti geniali,ma deve per forza comunicarla a tutto il mondo,così che poi lo mettono sui libri,e noi dobbiamo studiare cose assolutamente inutili che non ci serviranno a niente solo perché a loro non andava di fare una partita a carte ma preferivano capire da dove nasce tutto e cos'è tutto etc. etc. etc....|`|FsgEVAThaa	uao.

WZ6IBVyeaa	Discourse means conversations, arguments or speeches.  Basically, it's any communication between two people or peoples.  It can also mean an institutionalized way of thinking, eg two books about guerrillas, one refers to them as "freedom fighters" the other as "terrorists",they are written from two different ways of thinking. <br>  So I think your sentence means that the book expands on the Japanese way of thinking about it's colonies & colonial people.|`|yUIeiQI1aa	In that sentence I believe it means thoroughly exploring ideas and experiences of the colonies.

Che viene lavata...<br>  Per loro è come una azione che ha generato il resto del male (ogni peccato a partire dal primo genera ripercussioni, una sorta di inquinamento dell'armonia collettiva...o qualcosa del genere, nn ricordo dove l'ho letto!)...inoltre sia quello che gli altri peccati sono visti più come "malattie" che come "macchie"...la differenza qual'è? Le macchie si lavano, le malattie...si curano!<br>  <br>  Ovviamente queste dispute teologiche nn tolgono che il peccato sia una cosa gravge e spesso intenzionale, sia chiaro!<br>  <br>  Ma per gli Ortodossi, cosa succede?<br>  Essendo che il peccato nn è una "macchia" nel senso del termine, ma una malattia o cmq qualcosa che opprime...il discorso cambia...teologicamente parlando.<br>  <br>  Se Maria ha definito Gesà "mio salvatore", vuol dire che nn era proprio esente da peccato, nemmeno quello originale...sempre per loro, ti sto dicendo, sebbene la loro argomentazione mi piaccia di più come coerenza logica...<br>  <br>  Oppure si! Ma era sempre stata una opinione teologica...<br>  Un ortodosso è libero, appunto per ciò che ti ho elencato, di crederci oppure no (un cattolico, grazie agli ultimi Papi prima di Luciani, Wojtyla e Ratzinger, NO! Perchè è Dogma!)...cioè o che è stata già preservata dal peccato originale, o...che ne sia stata purificata dopo da Dio stesso!<br>  In entrambi i casi, secondo me, la santità di Maria nn viene calpestata in alcun modo, nn credi?<br>  E poi mi chiedo, davvero tutte quelle apparizioni sono autenticate come Mariane?

Se noi guardiamo nella Parola di Dio compare una situazione analoga dove Dio è intervenuto prontamente! Sara non poteva avere figli, ma li desiderava tanto. Dio ha dato una promessa ad Abramo, che nonostante la sterilità di Sara avrebbe concepito un figlio. Sono passati anni, Abramo a vissuto momenti di sconforto, tanto che aveva pattuito con la moglie di concepirne uno con la serva. Il figlio con la serva lo ha avuto.... ma guardate bene nonostante tutto Dio gli ha dato un figlio legittimo con Sara! Uno ora mi può dire, ma questa è una storia biblica di 100.000 anni fa.. io rispondo, che Gesù sulla crocei è venuto per spezzare ogni maledizione. Se credi in Cristo con il cuore e lo dichiari con la bocca , che è il tuo signore e salvatore ogni maledizione è spezzata!

Ormai, come in tutte le cose, anche la maternita' e' diventata un desiderio da soddisfare ad ogni costo, e non si e' piu' capaci di ammettere che ogni tanto qualcosa non si puo' avere. Voglio, voglio...e' la mentalita' corrente. Anch'io penso che se la Natura ci rema contro, a volte e' meglio mettersi l'anima in pace e magari pensare a un'adozione. Ma ormai l'essere umano si sente onnipotente e non e' piu' capace di rassegnarsi quando qualcosa non si puo' avere.|`|oC6kJZK6aa	Guarda, mia madre è sterile eppure subito dopo aver chiesto a Dio dei figli siamo nati io e mio fratello, quindi non credo proprio che Dio abbandoni all'infertilità chicchessia.<br>  Purtroppo c'è gente che deve farsi vedere sapiente pur essendo ignorante, ed è il caso del citato pretonzolo.

Si para ellos dios nos ama, no tienen forma de ver "objetivamente", esto es, sin ese velo que les otorga la religión y la p`rohibición de ver las osas de otra manera (inherente a la religión, of course), entonces JAMAS te dirán, "sí, es una forma de lavarse las manos". Están plenamente convencidos de que el dios todo poderoso, bondadoso, justo y ultramisericordioso, creó al diablo porque "el diablo" debe haberse creado solo por su vanidad, y que dios es bueno y por so le da la "oportunindad" de ganarle a dios en sus apestas para vver quien se queda con la humanidad. Ahí las víctimas sreian los humanos, no? pero si los humanos, teniendo "la escritura" (esa, que se entiende tan facil como para que todos podamos vivir una vida moral perfecta, pero que podemos interpretar de una y mil manras, cosa que de todas formas todos nos dejaríamos ganar por el diablo), nos dejamos guir por el diablo, por supuesto que es culpa nuestra, ya que "podemos elegir".

Saber eso, no sólo en el plano religioso sino en todo aspecto de la vida, nos hace crecer y madurar emocional y espiritualmente.<br>  <br>  Considerando lo anterior, asumir la vida de manera distinta, es decir prefiriendo que alguien destine tu vida, teniendo un concepto fatalista, implicaría optar por vivir en la "cárcel" o más bien "lavarse las manos" de las propias decisiones (actué mal o actué bien porque sí; porque alguien me manipuló; porque el destino estaba escrito para que hiciera eso).<br>  <br>  Creo que finalmente la convicción cristiana que apunta al "libre albedrío" es el mejor regalo que nos podría haber hecho Dios.

4XVfOtc8aa	Well you don't want to schmooze up the interviewer with tons of compliments--they'll see through that quickly.  Just be yourself, but natural, be polite.  Don't forget to bring a copy of your resume.  Biggest tip I ever got for interviewing is to DO YOUR HOMEWORK.  Many employers like to ask, "So what do you know about the company?" and if you're stumbling over your words trying to find an answer you can almost bet you're not getting the job.  So go to the company website and find out at least one or two things about it.<br>  <br>  Let's face it--interviews suck.  But if you're calm, relaxed and yourself you should get through it just fine.   Hope that helps.|`|AA10927032	I'm not sure I would do that.{ but be sure and thank the interviewer for the interview at the end]. Too many compliments might have her/him looking at your nose to see if it is brown, LOL. <br>  Every interview I have had did not leave me time to do anything but be interviewed, the HR person did the ice breaking, and most got right into the interview, with a little spiel about the job, or the place first. This one was the best, it started storming as soon as the interview started, they accused me of bringing the storm with me. As soon as the interview was over, the sun came out. I got even, I told them I might have brought the storm, but I was taking it back with me. They laughed, and I got the job. Thinking on my feet did it. <br>  If there is silence, and you need to fill it, try talking about the weather. It worked for me.|`|ku5CygN8aa	I, personally, would only give a compliment if I truly had one to give. Otherwise, you would run the risk of sounding phony or like you are kissing up. It's just like any other situation in the work place... a genuine compliment is appreciated, but if it's not meant with sincerity, it can be interpreted as one having concealed motives. You don't want to leave interviewers questioning your motives... or worse, guessing at them.|`|bfd757e929fbe877bf08fcde617935f1aa	Hi, I sit next to the HR person and I can  hear the interviews and her critiques after them. My advice is be yourself, be personable and friendly. <br>  To break the ice, just go with whatever is happening that day such as the weather, any breaking news and stuff. The tie compliment would be too obvious that you are trying to impress and desperate.
5b26c7ffaf844c2e8440ae57d104fb7baa	Kung fu would come in handy much more often than Christianity, and if the evangelicals mess with you, you can always just punch them in the throat.|`|3a2063f47e563461d790d63db29d4361aa	As a Buddhist, no, it is not against my religion. <br>  <br>  What we try to do however, is avoid conflicts at all costs, and if one does arise, we do only what is necessary to subdue and immobilize an attacker, not causing unneeded harm to our aggressor. Kung-fu is a primarily offensive martial arts practice, so it is not practiced by many Buddhists. I myself am a Gokyu in Aikido, a primarily defensive martial arts focused on blending in with your attacker and stopping conflict quickly, instead of meeting force with force.|`|AA10774894	I don't see how it is against Chrisianity.

How can that be of Christ if we are to live our lives for Christ? As a Christian Jesus is our Master not "merit master". So yes what you are doing is wrong for the Christian faith and no if you are practicing this theory then no you are not a Christian.|`|bd331396662563103830a5d7c1a7b5acaa	Kung Fu is an art of self-defence & a form of exercise.<br>  If Kung Fu is evil then so are other forms of exercise<br>  like aerobics, boxing, yoga or even cardio workouts<br>  as all these exercises requires breathing techniques of<br>  some sort. There's nothing wrong with meditations as it<br>  helps to calm the mind and gives you peace. <br>  <br>  However, it is not Christianity that judges it to be good or evil but the narrow minds of certain groups or individuals<br>  who cannot accept Kung Fu just because it originated <br>  from a country which practises Buddhism/Taoism.<br>  These so-called christians need to be educated that God<br>  had been teaching humankind of different nations even before Jesus came & if you do some research into Buddhism, it is similar to the Gospel's teachings only they have not known Christ. I also like to point out that in the book of Genesis, it is written; God breathe into the clump of dust & Adam was brought to life. This is the Qi or Breath as the Bible calls it. So using the breathing technique which God has imparted unto is is not by any standard evil. What is evil is the mind of humankind who profess to be Christians but not following the teachings of<br>  Christ by passing judgement on other people who does not form part of their norm.  As the saying goes, judge not & you shall not be judged.|`|da0072ad53981733385308f24009ba51aa	I am Roman Catholic. Ours is the oldest of all Christian churches. I see no problem at all with practicing Kung Fu. It teaches discipline and only uses violence in self-defense or in defense of weaker people. That is totally in line with Christian teaching and far from sacrilegious. The Christians who told you this were likely fundamentalists. These people are usually poorly educated in matters of religion. You can join their churches by raising your hand at the right time and mimicking a prayer. That means that many of their members are lost people that do not even know  what they joined. Do not worry, they also tell us that we are not Christians even though their churches (and Bible) originated with us. God is also the creator of common sense. There is no reason to defy it.|`|hakf4seXaa	no, kung fu does not go against chistianity, because they have the same basic values... peace, an open mind (though in my opinion christianity is a little more close minded than it likes to think) and an open palm versus a closed fist (or am i thinking tai chi?) anyway, its a good thing that it made you look at christianity from a different perspective for there are a lot of loopholes and asinine/hypocritical parts to it.|`|3734b5f7e7c27b91d0268c00d9e7ed41aa	Yes, you are fooled.<br>  Look to uranus.|`|5e27a835ce8832ab93d38acd90eeadadaa	Jesus was a true kung fu ninja...just look how he walked on that water....you could say he was the first true ninja
AA10927032	Ok, let's sort it out. Single Mom was pregnant before the new neighbors arrived, so tough luck to them on that point. 7-year old was there before the new folks. Again, their tough luck.<br>  Single Mom wants some heat for the child and the baby? She gets it, it is a child and a baby. The others can open a window, turn their heat down, leave. And how nice of single Mom to heat their units for them! Cheaper for them.<br>  Should single Mom go pay more for a unit with actual functioning walls that keep in sound and heat? Where there will be less tension? If the location is just as good, the unit nearly as cosmetically as good, Yes! Weigh this out: how many times a day do you shush the 7-year old, how many times will you jump up to quiet the baby? How many times will you feel guilty about the heat? Then add up how much less convenient a new place would be. Do the math, I bet you would spend less time being less convenient, than in all the shushing.|`|7S2sXMJ1aa	Go....to the clinic and start using birth control!!!!|`|AA10685939	go without a doubt.|`|F2ct2Vw9aa	That's quite a dilemma.

It is probably better to move before you have a little baby to take care of because that would be really difficult for obvious reasons.  I know it is tough to decide since you would have to invest your savings on it, but I think it would be healthier for you and your new baby to have a peaceful environment!

I know from experience that babies pick up on the stress and tension around them, especially from their Mom's and it will make them cry more and be cranky. It is like a vicious circle, the more they cry, the more up set the Mother becomes so the baby cries more. I think no anxiety would be worth the move. Good luck and I'm sure all will turn out all right. As long as your baby is healthy, the rest is nothing???|`|79475ef4eea5a94de4d732448a55cb1daa	move.. its better to allow your children to be children instead of hushing them all the time. Also living in a place that is too stressful on you is going to make it stressful on the kids. You already have enough stress.. Move and make it better for you family.
aad001ad10642673cf3af27e07a206a8aa	En realidad tu pregunta tiene un efecto! ser mas colectivo o mejor dicho poseer un pensamiento mas colectivo y solidadrio significa combatir contra la competitividad social y la lucha de clases, por ejemplo si un "rico" tendria un pensamiento mas colectivo, aceptaria ganar menos para favorecer de propia voluntad a los sectores mas pobres. Lo malo es que son pocos los ricachones que aceptarian donar parte de su riqueza para el bien de la humanidad.<br>  Otra forma de ser colectivo es, si todos somos participes de llevar adelante una vida mas limpia en nuestra ciudad, sin ensuciar tanto para no molestarnos entre vecinos, o modos de vida de en los cuales no malgastemos recursos naturales para no perjudicar a otros.<br>  Tener un pensamiento mas abierto y colectivo en realidad es pensar en vivir todos juntos los mas igualitariamente posible, lo malo es que los sistemas de mercado y de consumo siempre nos contaminan con ideas de "destaque" individual y personal, olvidandonos muchas veces de ser hasta solidarios y colectivos con nuestra propia familia!|`|Kl5L4Byuaa	Yo pienso que ayudaría bastante si pensáramos más en los demás y sorbería para solucionar problemas de delicuencia y pobreza que en mi país se sienten fuertemente, aunque Chile esta bien calificado dentro de América del sur, pero igual nos falta mucho por hacer.Aquí la gente acomodada no ayuda mucho al necesitado y hasta, a veces, regala cosas rotas a los más pobres, cosas que ni ellos usarían.Eso da verguenza ajena.Entonces ayudar a la comunidad para que logremos un mundo mejor.|`|QvRNoRoNaa	Los problemas sociales se acabarían, No si piensas más en lo colectivo que en lo individual, sino Si pensarás diferente desde lo individual.

qOwsX45laa	Festa di sovrapposizione.<br>  Il 25 dicembre a Roma si festeggiava il "Natalis Solis Invictus " ovvero , la chiusura del solstizio d'inverno ed il simbolo di tale festa era un albero ovviamente spoglio addobbato con oggetti colorati per propiziare un ricco raccolto .Tale data rappresentava anche il giorno della nascita di Mitra<br>  Visto che tale festa pagana non si riusciva ad eliminare , i soliti preti hanno pensato bene di farci nascere Cristo al 25 di dicembre !  Comunque l'albero è sopravvissuto ai preti ! ...Ciapa sù ! ....<br>  <br>  Stesso discorso per la Pasqua di risurrezione , visto che la festa in onore del Dio Mitra cadeva  aPasqua , hanno deciso di farci risorgere Cristo .....Ma l'Uovo , prerogativa di Mitra , simbolo di fertilità e di vita è sopravissuto ai preti ! ....Riciàpa sù !....<br>  <br>  Veramente, il Mitraismo rappresentò la più grande sfida al Cristianesimo, che vinse per un pelo sul culto del suo concorrente. In comune con la figura di Cristo, Mitra ha quanto segue:<br>  ? Mitra nacque da una vergine il 25 dicembre in una grotta, e la sua nascita fu accompagnata da pastori che portarono doni.<br>  <br>  ? Egli fu considerato un grande insegnante e maestro itinerante.<br>  <br>  ? Egli ebbe 12 compagni o discepoli.<br>  <br>  ? Ai seguaci di Mitra veniva promessa immortalità.<br>  <br>  ? Egli fece miracoli.<br>  <br>  ? Come il “grande toro del Sole”, Mitra si sacrificò per la pace del mondo.<br>  <br>  ? Egli fu sepolto in una tomba e risorse dopo tre giorni.<br>  <br>  ? La sua resurrezione veniva celebrata ogni anno.<br>  <br>  ? Egli fu era chiamato “il Buon Pastore” ed identificato sia con l’Agnello che col Leone.<br>  <br>  ? Egli era considerato “la Via, la Verità e la Luce”, ed il “Logos”, “Redentore”, “Salvatore”, e “Messia”.<br>  <br>  ? Il suo giorno sacro era la Domenica, il “Giorno del Signore”, centinaia di anni prima della comparsa di Cristo.<br>  <br>  ? Mitra aveva la sua festività principale in quella che più tardi sarebbe diventata la Pasqua.<br>  <br>  ? La sua religione aveva una eucaristia o “Cena del Signore”, alla quale Mitra disse, “Colui che non mangerà il mio corpo né berrà del mio sangue in modo che egli possa diventare una sola cosa con me ed Io con lui, non sarà salvato”.<br>  <br>  ? “Il suo sacrificio annuale è la pasqua dei Magi, una espiazione simbolica o pegno di rigenerazione morale e fisica”.<br>  <br>  In aggiunta, il Vaticano stesso è costruito sul papato di Mitra, e la gerarchia Cristiana è quasi identica alla versione Mitraica che ha rimpiazzato.<br>  <br>  Triciàpa su!

Con l'avvento del Cristianesimo la festa pagana ( anche piuttosto disordinata... tipo riti a bacco ecc) fu disciplinata nel ricordo dell'unica vera luce, Dio fatto uomo! Anche il presepe ha un origine pagana: rientrava nel culto dei morti e le statuine che si organizzavano in villaggi, nelle case erano quelle dei defunti protettori della famiglia ( avvenivano anche degli scambi tra famiglie). Ora, al contrario babbo natale ha un origine cristiana, ossia in quei santi che in passato erano soliti portare doni ai bambini ( tipo san Nicola di Bari...). La coca cola lo ha trasformato in un mito e comunque chiaramente non c'entra niente con il Natale del quale si è perso molto il significato! Possiamo dire che  il Natale si è praticamente "ripaganeggiato" come festa ( lo sappiamo!) dei consumi,  che sono la grande luce - guida della vita di oggi!|`|9756d7be720022e573de60b38b9cf1e8aa	si natale e cattolico, penso babbo natale e anche vero che porta regali per i bimbi bisognosi, penso di no pero ci sono anche dice babbo natale e mama natale che portanno doni|`|WWexIEwtaa	Si il Natale è cattolico perche ricorda il grande mistero dell'incarnazione del Figlio di Dio.Purtroppo molti confondono la fede con il folklore,ma di questo si renderà conto a Dio.Ciao.|`|ZhEIL5DUaa	Non è colpa mia se la società moderna ha trasformato la festa del Natale in una festa consumistica, in cui viene evidenziato solo il fatto che ci si deve scambiare un mucchio di regali e Cristo passa in secondo ordine.|`|uzm1QQyhaa	Il Natale  come lo conosciamo  è l' integrazione di una festa germanica della prosperità, Babbo Natale presumibilmente  nasce dopo il 300 DC dalla figura di un vescovo turco San Nicola|`|viqFWweqaa	Tutte le domande che riguardano Chiesa, preti, Gesù e così via implicano sempre risposte da parte dei soliti, che oltraggiano in maniera velata o esplicita la loro ignoranza e ottusaggine, mi riferisco solo ad alcuni ovviamente e non ne faccio i nomi per questioni di lunghezza, gli oltraggi che voi pedissequamente fate pervenire attraverso le vostre risposte dovranno un giorno passare, volenti o nolenti, sotto il giudizio di Dio, il quale con la sua imperscrutabile giustiza darà o toglierà ad ognuno di voi i meriti per entrare nel suo regno.<br>  Visto che a noi poveri mortali non ci è dato di sapere quale sarà l'esito di tale giudizio, rimando volenteri le conclusioni a quel fausto giorno...|`|xtrSs5U1aa	se vuoi qualche info in più... qualche curiosità in più sul natale leggi questo articolino...<br>  <a href="http://www.ilnavigatore.org/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=40" rel="nofollow">http://www.ilnavigatore.org/modules.php?...</a><br>  :-)|`|e373cadbea0077ee2ed3db91051e093baa	no natale non è cattolico <br>  anche nei paesi arabi si festeggia il natale ma loro sono di  più musulmani quindi natale non è cattolico|`|62d2816316aec4351c697cccc5dc4000aa	Babbo Natale non c'entra niente con l'evento di Cristo!

Ma secondo me sei già nei guai da un punto di vista logico, infatti: per dimostrare la non esistenza di qualcosa, quel qualcosa deve anche essere affermato. Dio non esiste ma cosa non esiste? Dio. Dunque Dio esiste. Sembra una sottigliezza ma facciamo un' incursione in matematica: io dimostro che un sistema formale deduttivo come l'aritmetica non è completo, ma cosa ho dimostrato, che la completezza non esiste? Evidentemente no. Ho dimostrato che all'interno dell'aritmetica c'è sempre almeno una formula vera che non può essere dimostrata, cioè dedotta a partire dagli assiomi, perchè ad esempio implica una situazione in cui, se fosse dimostrabile lo sarebbe anche la sua negazione. Ne deduco che gli assiomi sono incompleti, ma non ne deduco affatto che la completezza non esiste. Come potrei dimostrare l'incompletezza di un sistema se la completezza non esistesse? Tu potresti soltanto dimostrare come l'esistenza di Dio, all'interno del sistema deduttivo che hai utilizzato per formulare la dimostrazione, sia indimostrabile. Non proveresti dunque proprio un bel nulla. Anzi, siccome la tua dimostrazione si poggia sul'idea di Dio, da qui si potrebbe partire direttamente con la prova ontologica, ad esempio, per non andare a parare sul solito Anselmo, quella cartesiana: possiedo un'idea di Dio (o l'idea di perfezione), ma quest'idea non è come tutte le altre, non ha infatti un oggetto a cui si riferisca ma è in sè stessa l'unica idea la cui essenza implica l'esistenza..ecc..Come vedi, ed è la prova ontologica classica, si afferma chiaramente che Dio non esiste se non in quanto idea, ma poi se ne deduce che, senza questa idea, tutte le altre potrebbero benissimo essere illusioni, fantasie, rappresentazioni...Se questo è anche accettabile nella vita quotidiana non può esserlo se vogliamo fare filosofia, scienza, o matematica, cioè se vogliamo costruire una qualsiasi dimostrazione, compresa la tua.<br>  <br>  p.s La rossa: Dio è il nulla, il nulla però è,non ne parleresti se non fosse, stai involontariamente dimostrando l'esistenza di Dio a partire dal concetto di nulla, che è forse il più problematico di tutti i concetti. Questa è la strada che hanno deciso di seguire i grandi mistici dell'ebraismo, dove si comincia appunto dal nulla per dedurre poi tutte e fasi della creazione.|`|df5f09f88f668ac148fb7d10b3564223aa	ma vallo a dire a qualcun altro|`|oVTBZYpyaa	spero però non sia una waccata da bastardidentro|`|561e6af41bd94581f539e204d8079a05aa	Non mi serve, grazie... lo so già... e a chi crede non serve perchè non lo vuole sapere...<br>  Quindi... apprezza tu il tuo lavoro... penso che sia solo un bene...|`|942d82697fd0a967d4462f39d07bf140aa	pubblica qui la dimostrazione, sn curiosa! cmq io sn + k convinta k Dio nn esiste, ma il fatto k la gente c creda nn è d x se 1 problema... il vero problema è la religione, l'oppio dei popoli..
9bd483ed26228f2d38b057882dbdfe6eaa	Antonio Zichichi è uno scienziato -per quanto non goda  a quanto sembra di buona fama nel suo ambiente - e non vi sono dubbi; che poi sia bravo nel suo lavoro oppure no, questo è un altro discorso.<br>  <br>  Mentre il creazionismo non è affatto una teoria scientifica, e chi lo crede vero -e non riesco proprio ad immaginare come sia possibile - si sbaglia. Il creazionismo è una supposizione basata sulla fede: se si crede in un dio e si postula che lui ha creato il mondo e quant'altro, il creazionismo nasce da sè. ma non ha prove, tranne il fatto che sta scritto da qualche parte, in qualche libro..ossia non ne ha, perchè non basta mica dire "è vero perchè c'è scritto lì che è così" per poter dire di una cosa che sia vera o no. Ci si crede per fede, oppure no. La religione nasce per fornire all'uomo risposte salde, immutabili; e chi la accetta deve per forza riconoscere come vere le sue affermazioni dogmatiche anche qualora esse non siano più adatte a ciò che via via si scopre: se migliaia di anni fa il creazionismo era accettabile come la terra piatta, è chiaro che chi ha scritto -per esempio -la Bibbia ne parlasse e li considerasse certi, ma oggi non lo sono più.<br>  Senza l'esistenza dei dogmi, però, la fede crollerebbe, perchè sono le fondamenta e chi la sceglie deve accettare di avere una casa costruita su fondamenta antichissime, a volte di mirabile costruzione ma spesso  deboli, forse proprio per via della loro natura.|`|62d2816316aec4351c697cccc5dc4000aa	Mi stupisco di quanta gente "ragionante" spara a zero su cose che dovrebbe conoscere meglio...clap clap!!!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.creationism.org/heinze/italian/HeIta02.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.creationism.org/heinze/italia...</a><br>  <br>  Innanzitutto leggete meglio QUESTO!<br>  La teoria del creazionismo NON HA a che vedere con la Bibbia, nè con la fede, ma a constatare che se il creato (che tutti gli uomini di scienza sono daccordo, è PERFETTO in ogni sua sfacettatura) fosse venuto dal caso...che se il sole era più grande o più piccolo di adesso, o l'asse terrestre inclinato di più di quello che dovrebbe essere, ecc.ecc.ecc...non ci sarebbe vita!<br>  <br>  E' semplicemente constatare che tutto ciò che esiste nn si è creato dal caso NE' sia sempre esistito.<br>  Tutto questo si chiama col suo vero nome:<br>  LA REALTA'!<br>  Questa per noi che già crediamo nella testimonianza di Cristo (che già ci basta, nn ci serve nessun'altra prova più credibile della Sua)altro nn è che la conferma in assoluto dell'esistenza di Dio, la constatazione che la perfezione del creato, visibile tutti i giorni atraveso la natura...è UN MIRACOLO!<br>  Perchè niente di tutto ciò sarebbe venuto dall'esplosione di un petardo, per farvi capire...beh, lo sapete, è così!<br>  Se poi mi dite che Dio cmq nnm è dimostrabile scientificamente in base a questo, sono daccordo, anzi...<br>  APPUNTO PER QUESTO non venitemi a dire che il creazionismo è una teoria del (c)azzo, nè che vuole dimostrare l'esistenza di Dio, nè che è basata sulla Bibbia o sulla Fede, nn ho letto nel link che la terra è stata fatta in sei giorni di 24ore.<br>  Quindi tornate pure a studiare amici miei atei, che davvero sembrate meno preparati di me, stavolta!<br>  Ci vediamo in biblioteca!!! <br>  <br>  Ah ah ah ah ah!!!|`|82687ac8159e8d5834b1e5aff7f76f6baa	UN CONGIUNTIVO DI TROPPO.<br>  ANZI DUE.<br>  <br>  e Zichichi e il Creazionismo ?<br>  anche loro due congiuntivi di troppo|`|f4ca7f76e9ba2d314d76d9b7281c9dedaa	Zichichi e' uno scienziato.

(L’origine delle specie, di Charles Darwin, Boringhieri, 1959, trad. dall’inglese di Luciana Fratini, p. 189.)<br>  <br>   Da allora è passato più di un secolo. Il problema è stato forse risolto? No. Al contrario, ciò che si è appreso sull’occhio dai tempi di Darwin a oggi indica che l’occhio è ancora più complesso di quanto pensasse lui. Per questo Jastrow dice riguardo all’occhio: “Si direbbe il frutto di un rigoroso progetto ingegneristico: nessun costruttore di telescopi avrebbe saputo fare di meglio”. (Il telaio incantato . . . e l’evoluzione creò l’intelligenza, cit., p. 101.)<br>  <br>  Se questo vale per l’occhio, che dire allora del cervello umano? Dato che nemmeno il più semplice meccanismo si evolve per caso, come può ritenersi un fatto l’evoluzione del cervello, infinitamente più complesso? Jastrow conclude dicendo: “Se è difficile accettare che l’evoluzione dell’occhio umano sia prodotto del caso, lo è ancor più accettare che l’evoluzione dell’intelligenza umana sia il prodotto di guasti casuali verificatisi nelle cellule cerebrali dei nostri antenati”.

Questo vale per tutti quelli che vorrebbero cercare prove scientifiche nella Bibbia e affermazioni di fede nella scienza. Il creazionismo è uno dei prodotti di questo grandissimo cattivo gusto (non so come altro definirlo) che vuole che siccome nella Genesi Dio in sette giorni creò piante, animali ecc. ecc. così deve essere stato per atto di fede. E' chiaro che in questo modo il pensiero scientifico, ridotto a dover confermare il principio di fede, non ha nessun senso. Se tutto è già scritto nella Bibbia che senso ha investire soldi nella ricerca scientifica? E' evidente che la scienza non serve assolutamente a nulla. Ne consegue che lo stesso Zichichi che si definisce scienziato non servirebbe assolutamente a nulla. Ma in questa lettura oggettivamente realistica del testo sacro, come se fosse un libro di biologia o di storia, è lo stesso testo sacro a venirne profondamente sminuito, perché finisce per apparire agli occhi di chi di scienza si occupa una specie di libro di favolette per bambini, bambini che hanno una paura matta del dubbio e dell'errore, mentre è proprio l'errore a essere il motore propulsivo indispensabile per ogni avanzamento scientifico al punto che una teoria è scientifica solo se è falsificabile (o verificabile che dir si voglia).

67a63154ad765390dfa605efa98acc3daa	Ovviamente non lo so. So che leggo di padri, madri, parenti, amici, maestri e allenatori e anche di preti, ma non giurerei che la proporzione sia a favore di questi ultimi. <br>  Visto il tuo interesse ti suggerirei di leggere un libro istruttivo. Lo scrive un prete tedesco scomunicato, certo Eugen Drewermann e s'intitola "Funzionari di Dio" edizioni Raetia che narra le problematiche della vita in seminario, dell'assenza di formazione sentimentale, del dramma dellla solitudine vissuto da tanti giovani mandati in seminario troppo presto o provenienti da famiglie dove esistevano delle patologie di relazione. Il libro, di oltre seicento pagine, parla senza peli sulla lingua di ciò che avviene, ma non emerge mai il problema della pedofilia bensì emergono difficoltà di relazione, onanismo compulsivo, autolesionismo anche se non a livelli di suicidio, problemi di fede, eccetera. <br>  Questo non significa che non vi siano anche coloro che vivono il problema della pedofilia, ma il quadro che emerge da quest'analisi (Drewermann è anche psicanalista) è di tutt'altra specie ed altrettanto grave. Drewermann inoltre è dentro il sistema, quindi sembrerebbe degno di fede dato che essendo stato scomunicato per un problema di obbedienza non aveva nessuna remora dal tacere quel che sapeva, se lo avesse saputo. Sciorina tanti di quelle miserie che avrebbe detto anche questa. <br>  Diciamo che l'equazione prete=pedofilia sarebbe il caso di ridimensinarla perchè è una piaga che purtroppo si manifesta indipendentemente dalla formazione religiosa. <br>  I pedofili vogliono fondare un partito in Olanda e sono tanti e di tutti i generi e sono pure laici. Ci sono tuttavia anche dei preti pedofili e il guaio è che quando ne emerge uno fa un fracasso come se fossero milioni. <br>  E' anche giusto che sia così perchè chi più sta in alto più fa rumore quando cade e più si fa male e fa del male.|`|b536c8e14ed51cfe62ac9ab8ee215f46aa	Anche UNO è uno di troppo !!!|`|f4ca7f76e9ba2d314d76d9b7281c9dedaa	la pedofilia è un reato troppo a lungo sottostimato o guardato addirittura con sufficienza e ironia.... vedi turismo sessuale maschile e femminile in alcuni Paesi che tutti conoscono e dove il turismo continua ad aumentare.

Quando giunse in Arcadia, gli si pararono innanzi due serpenti che si divoravano a vicenda, allora egli gettò il bastone tra loro ed essi si riappacificarono. Da questa leggenda è nato il simbolo del Caduceo, un segno di pace rappresentato da un bastone con due ali aperte e due serpenti attorcigliati che si guardano l'un l'altro. <br>  <br>  Per questa ragione, nell'antica Grecia, il Caduceo divenne il simbolo degli araldi negoziatori di pace. Mentre, in origine, doveva proteggergli dai pericoli presenti nei territori stranieri, divenne poi un generico segno di pace. Lo si è anche considerato simbolo dell'equilibrio morale e della condotta esemplare: il bastone esprime il potere; i due serpenti la sapienza, le ali la diligenza, e l'elmo è l'emblema dei pensieri elevati. Gli sono stati attribuiti altri molteplici valori, dalla fecondità-fertilità, alla medicina (anche oggi viene talora utilizzato come insegna dell'attività farmaceutica).|`|5ef187ae4d8e7db7b048b80eb17b8fafaa	Intendi il bastone di esculapio?

Sono pratiche che ancora vivono in certi luoghi<br>  chi ha una certa sensibilità ,non può non accorgersene<br>  per quanto mi riguarda ,vedo quest'ultima forma di "magia"<br>  come un mezzo per arrivare alla conoscenza e non un qualcosa fine a se stesso ,per cui mi incuriosisce ma scappo atterrito non quando vedo un demone , ma quando in essa vedo il minimo riflesso del potere dell'uomo sull'uomo<br>  ma ho il vago sospetto che forse le due cose siano la stessa cosa ,il demone e il potere<br>  3) ma forse la più importante magia è quella che viviamo<br>  senza concetti ,quella cosa che fa si che due anime si incontrino , quella che ci vede in armonia con qualcosa del creato ,quella che ci fa parlare senza parole con un animale o anche con una pianta ,quella che vede nella nostra vita  degli accadimenti meravigliosi e incontri inaspettati ,è solo la magia dell'anima che si sintonizza nel creato senza interferenze della mente ,<br>  e la coscienza di questa magia è  la vera magia<br>  <br>  HK l'hai presa personalmente il mio era un esempio e basta ,<br>  ok non sei cristiano ,ma pensi come un cristiano ! e parli di satana! di certo non l'ho inventata io la figura del caprone a cui tu fai riferimento e del satanismo non me ne può fregar di meno ,e dei suoi esperti ancora meno ,non leggo porcherie ! ripeto che sono due facce dello stesso modo di manipolare con concetti dualistici la religiosita dell'individuo ,punto e basta! <br>  as esempio io sono contro il nucleare ,ma non sono contro l'energia! e gli esperti del nucleare possono andare a quel paese quando vogliono loro non sono l'energia ! non sono i depositari della scienza .-l'hai capita almeno questa?<br>  posso capire che tu sia stato scottato da queste sette demenziali ,e voglia dare il consiglio di starne lontani ,ma questo non significa dover chiudere gli occhi ! ho fatto una distinzione nella mia risposta ,tu ne hai fatto un fascio !!<br>  in questo sei satanico poichè Un'obiezione di ordine tecnico è il primo rifugio di chi non vuole ascoltare<br>  <br>  va bene ritiro il satanico che può essere espressione forte ,però devi perdonarmi se non faccio troppa distinzione fra cattolici e cristiani ,comunque "l'inferno esiste solo, per chi ne ha paura" <br>  altri sono i diavoli , quelli veri...<br>  Ken Russell  fece un ottimo film sul tema...( I Diavoli 1971)|`|866a46e62ddf9c26732be873ef09e2f0aa	Se escludiamo i maghetti e fattucchiere di oggi che sono un branco di ciarlatani, nonchè le superstizioni annesse, alla magia ci credo, perchè la grande maga è la Natura. La magia personale esiste ma non serve per risolvere i problemi del quotidiano ma per entrare in sintonia con la Natura ed evolversi. A quel punto un aspetto di Madre Natura viene anche in aiuto, anche se spesso non è il modo che avremmo scelto, ma sempre risulta il migliore. Madre Natura non è deficiente come le religioni vogliono farla apparire, ma è intelligente e divina.

Die Welt war überschaubar, gut und b?se klar definiert. Es gibt dann natürlich immer auch findige Gesch?ftemacher, die auf diesen Zug aufspringen, pl?tzlich gab es Partys, bei denen FDJ-Hemden erwünscht waren und wie das so ist mit den Herden, die Menschen machten mit. Hauptsache Unterhaltung und Nostalgie, man erinnerte sich an ,,bessere" Zeiten (denn früher ist immer besser...) und besann sich darauf, sowieso der bessere Mensch gegenüber dem dekadenten Westen zu sein.<br>  Fakt ist allerdings auch, dass die wenigsten dieser Ostalgiker die wirkliche DDR zurückwünschen, wenn überhaupt, dann bestenfalls so eine Art DDR light, mit Gesch?ften voll wie im Westen. Denn zur Erinnerung geh?rt eben auch die Verdr?ngung der Realit?t, sie wird durch eine gesch?nte Variante ersetzt, man vergisst das Negative.<br>  Pers?nlich muss ich sagen, ist mir diese Ostalgie eher unverst?ndlich bis absto?end, ich vermied es IN der DDR, mit einem Blauhemd herumzulaufen, warum sollte ich es danach tun?|`|8OQRLmHFaa	Oh ja!Da gab es mal so eine Maraquja limo wei? der Geier wie die hie? sie war so lecker!|`|93e4b8203488e526afd6f832f5289c58aa	Es gibt viele Sachen von früher, die aus dem Osten stammen und einfach gut sind.

Bi4OCxHKaa	Wir wissen es nicht. Es gibt keine historischen Hinweise darauf. Aber es ist sehr gut m?glich, denn in Vorderasien in der Antike waren derartig frühe Verlobungen (!) gang und g?be (die Heirat war in der Regel Jahre sp?ter). Es war in keinem Sinne P?dophilie. Die Bibel berichtet ja glaubwürdig, dass Maria "von keinem Manne wei?" (Luk 1,34), wie immer man die Geburt Jesu aus der Jungfrau biologisch oder historisch verstehen mag.<br>  über das, was gar nicht in der Bibel steht, soll man auch nicht nachgrübeln.<br>  Wirklich mit 14 hat geheiratet die heilige Elisabeth von Thüringen. Sie ist 1207 in Ungarn geboren und wurde vierj?hrig mit dem Landgrafensohn Hermann verlobt (der 11 Jahre ?lter war) und zur Erziehung an den thüringischen Hof (die Wartburg bei Eisenach) geschickt. Hermann starb 1216 (natürlich ohne dass die beiden sexuelle Beziehungen hatten!), und sein jüngerer Bruder Ludwig heiratete 1221 die 14j. Elisabeth, die alsbald drei Kinder bekam (von denen eines, Sophie, die Gründerin der Landgrafschaft Hessen wurde). Ludwig starb 1227 auf dem Kreuzzug im Orient, und Elisabeth 1231 in Marburg (wo ihre Grabeskirche steht, die erste gotische Kirche in Deutschland) im Alter von 24 Jahren - das Leben der nach der Mutter Maria am h?chsten verehrten Frau der Christenheit, eine Geschichte wie aus einer anderen Zeit. Elisabeths Heiligsprechung war die bislang "schnellste": zwei Jahre nach ihrem Tod (suche wikipedia über google).<br>  PS: Kuchenmacher hat recht, aber wir haben Belege über die Bar- und Bat-Mizwah-Praxis erst aus der Zeit nach der "Synode von Jamnia" (70-100 nC), die das Judentum neu ordnete nach der Zerst?rung des Tempels, keine aus der Zeit davor.|`|a129fabbd39df3b12274a2145e9ad076aa	Man geht im Gro?en und Ganzen davon aus, dass die Menschen im Orient früher geheiratet hatten. Das hei?t noch lange nicht, dass Maria 12 oder 14 Jahre alt war, es gibt keine zuverl?ssige Quelle darüber.<br>  In der Bibel steht überhaupt nichts darüber, wie alt Maria war. Dass sie "von keinem Manne wu?te", lag an den strengen Gesetzen, wo vorehelicher Verkehr eh verboten war. <br>  Mach dir also keine Gedanken darüber.<br>  Au?erdem hatte der Engel, der es Maria verkündigte, praktisch "ihre Zustimmung" eingeholt, weil sie ihm sagte: "Siehe, ich bin des Herrn Magd; mir geschehe, was du gesagt hast!" <br>  Du kannst es auch unter dem Aspekt sehen, dass jede Frau in Israel insgeheim hoffte, die Mutter vom ersehnten Messias zu werden.|`|h83WrIBTaa	Ich finde es erstaunlich, was für interessante Details doch immer wieder auftauchen und die Leute entsetzen und schockieren und dazu bringen zu zweifeln und Gottes Volk zu verurteilen, die jeglicher biblischer und historischer Grundlage entbehren.<br>  Hast du nicht den Pfarrer gefragt, woher diese "genaue" Information stammt?

Bi4OCxHKaa	Dass die landeskirchlichen Protestanten zu so etwas wie "Synkretismus" neigen, ist eine der unausrottbaren, aber dennoch unverantwortlichen, ja eigentlich b?sartigen Unterstellungen von Seiten mancher (!) Evangelikaler und Freikirchler.<br>  <br>  Diese haben eine so festgelegte Konzeption von Bibelverst?ndnis und Exegese, dass sie alle anderen des Unglaubens verd?chtigen.<br>  <br>  Unsere protestantischen Landeskirchen riskieren einfach eine gro?e Offenheit, akzeptieren die "distanzierte Kirchlichkeit" vieler Kirchenmitglieder und verweigern sich der Messlatte "Gottesdienstbesuch". Nur auf diese Weise konnten wissenschaftliche Theologie, historisch-kritische Exegese, existentielle Hermeneutik, christlich-jüdischer Dialog, Gleichstellung und Ordination von Frauen, Einbeziehen von Methoden von Gespr?chstherapie und Psychologie in die seelsorgerliche Beratung und nicht zuletzt der politische Widerstand in der Nazizeit Boden gewinnen. An dieser Offenheit wollen wir auch dranbleiben. Evangelisch hei?t Freiheit.<br>  <br>  Der kommende Kirchentag in K?ln wird das wieder deutlich machen.<br>  <br>  Den Spie? mit dem Synergismus k?nnte man leicht umdrehen. Der Protestantismus hat eine "offene Flanke" der Dialogf?higkeit hin zu intelligenten, fragenden, offenen Agnostikern und zur "religionslosen Welt von heute" (in Italien: zum "laicismo"), ja, aber Katholizismus und evangelikale Fundis verbünden sich eher mit Aberglauben, patriarchalischen Weltbildern und unkritisch weitergeschleppten Moralvorstellungen.<br>  <br>  Die einzige Wahrheit ist Jesus Christus selbst, sein Leben (Bergpredigt), Sterben am Kreuz und Auferstehen. Nicht ein Dogmenkatalog von Kreationismus bis Weltuntergangsprophetien.<br>  <br>  Da mag nun jeder w?hlen, welche Variante von Christentum er/sie sucht.<br>  <br>  Ich hoffe, ich war nicht unh?flich. Aber wir Protestanten sitzen so oft zwischen den Stühlen "Hardcore-Christen" oder Atheismus, dass man sich spürbar freistrampeln muss. Ich wollte dabei niemandem auf die Zehen treten. Aber jetzt k?nnte klar sein, dass wir nicht einen "verw?sserten" Glauben suchen, sondern (Kirchentagsmotto) auf das Wort Gottes h?ren wollen, das "lebendig und kr?ftig und sch?rfer" als jedes zweischneidige Schwert ist (Hebr 4,12).|`|c8d88f679e6df4a07d8e8a976fe29209aa	Als Synkretismus habe ich die Eigenart abgespeichert sich seinen eigenen Glauben zusammenzubasteln. Ich bin gelernter (ausgetretener) Katholik und lebe jetzt in einer überwiegend protestantischen Gegend und habe die kuriose Erfahrung gemacht, dass insbesondere Katholiken sehr h?ufig Anleihen im Aberglauben suchen (Tarot, Wahrsagen, Pendeln etc.). Die Prostestanten scheinen eine Spur mehr bei ihrem Glauben zu bleiben, wahrscheinlich weil der ganze "Schnickschnack", den die Katholiken machen, fehlt. Allerdings nehmen hier in der Diaspora die Katholiken ihren Glauben sehr ernst, vermutlich weil sie sich als Minderheit wahrnehmen und ihn viel bewusster leben.|`|meKrqoglaa	Den Begriff habe ich noch nie geh?rt!<br>  Aber Du hast ihn wohl mit W?ssrigkeit übersetzt!<br>  <br>  Also ich bin zwar Katholisch, meine Familie ist jedoch evangelisch!<br>  Man kann ja manches gegen die katholische Kirche sagen, aber was ich von der evangelischen Kirche mitbekomme, ist mit W?ssrigkeit schon gut umschrieben!<br>  Ich stelle fest, da? viele Christen nur eine sehr lockere Bindung zu ihrer Kirche haben und umgekehrt!<br>  Es fehlt an Traditionen und verbindliches Riten!<br>  Es gibt nicht mal eine Figur vom Format eines Kardinal Lehmann, von einem protestantischen Papst ganz zu schweigen!

kxenIGXzaa	Doppelt h?lt vielleicht besser. Ich versuche die Erkl?rung noch einmal:<br>  <br>  Au?er den drei Zeitformen (Gegenwart, Vergangenheit und Zukunft) gibt es im Russischen noch Aspekte, welche anzeigen, ob die durch die Zeitform ausgedrückte Handlung, der geschilderte Zustand oder Vorgang<br>  <br>  1. unvollendet<br>  2. vollendet<br>  3. einmalig<br>  4. mehrmalig<br>  ist. Hier besch?ftigen uns nur die beiden ersten Aspekte. <br>  <br>  Der durch den unvollendeten und vollendeten Aspekt zum Ausdruck gebrachte Unterschied war früher auch im Deutschen vorhanden, ist aber heute nur noch schwach erkennbar.  <br>  Schlagen, bauen, blicken sind typische unvollendete Verben im Deutschen. Die von ihnen ausgedrückte Handlung dauert fort, ist unvollendet.<br>  <br>  Dagegen sind erschlagen, erbauen, erblicken vollendete Verben. <br>  <br>  "Er baute ein Haus." bedeutet, dass er damit besch?ftigt war, ein Haus zu bauen.<br>  <br>  "Er erbaute ein Haus." bedeutet, dass das Haus wirklich fertig wurde, die Handlung zu einem Abschluss kam.<br>  <br>  "Ученик решал задачу."  bedeutet: Der Schüler l?ste die Aufgabe. (war mit der L?sung besch?ftigt.)<br>  <br>  "Ученик решил задачу."  bedeutet: Der Schüler hat die Aufgabe gel?st. (war fertig)<br>  <br>  Daher werden jeweils zwei Verben ben?tigt:<br>  <br>  решатъ  l?sen (unvollendetes Verb)<br>  <br>  решитъ  l?sen (vollendetes Verb)<br>  <br>  Um die Verben richtig anzuwenden, muss man sich, wie bereits oben gesagt wurde, den jeweiligen Zeitablauf vor Augen führen. Au?erdem muss man die Verben auswendig lernen. Kindern f?llt das kinderleicht. Erwachsene müssen üben, üben, üben.<br>  <br>  <br>  Aber wie auch gesagt wurde, für das Leben ist die Kenntnis der unterschiedlichen Verben nicht überlebenswichtig.

27183f771b0b47f6e6c2a28571a44a4caa	E' certamente una bella domanda, davvero interessante. <br>  <br>  Non sono cattolico. <br>  Preferisco dichiararmi agnostico ed in teoria a questa domanda non dovrei rispondere, però vorrei tentare di darti una possibile (anche se parziale, ci mancherebbe...) soluzione, ovviamente opinabile, se non altro per cercare di infondere in te un pò di speranza ed una possibile spiegazione logica.<br>  <br>  Semplificando al massimo e riducendo all'osso i concetti io trovo che la vita in sè, prescindendo dalla possibilità che essa venga dal Dio cristiano o da quello Indhù, dal caos o da altre ignote origini, sia sempre un dono. <br>  La coscienza della vita è già una luce che è preclusa a chi non è vivo. Chi non è ancora nato e chi non appartiene più a questa vita non può godere della gioia che questa coscienza può regalare. Essere vivi significa partecipare ad un disegno dalle proporzioni incommensurabili ed in parte ignote nel quale si crede ed al quale ci si affida (Dio) oppure fare parte di una Danza Cosmica (religioni orientali) oppure di un sistema in cui ogni cosa ha una sua spiegazione logica e razionale, incluse le malattie e la morte (Evoluzionismo).<br>  Giustamente tu dici che non può essere un dono una vita costituita dal dolore, ed è molto difficile confutare la tua affermazione. <br>  Secondo il mio personale giudizio la vita può essere un dono o uno sventurato e tragico accidente secondo la percezione individuale di ognuno. Non tutti i malati terminali, né tutti i ciechi dalla nascita, né tutti coloro che hanno difficoltà a vivere considerano la vita una sventura, ed anzi spesso sono proprio le persone abituate ad una vita "difficile" che maggiormente la considerano un dono e che più le sono attaccate. Ed è anche vero che per molte sventurate persone la vita è solo un pesante ed insostenibile fardello di cui ci si può liberare con la morte.<br>  Ma non è neppure scontato che persone quotidianamente "appagate" dalla vita siano in grado di cogliere la bellezza del vivere e considerare questo un dono. Ci sono persone che nel loro quotidiano vivono nell'ignavia, conducendo una vita fatta di falsi valori, inseguendo chimere ed obiettivi assolutamente futili ed effimeri, e dubito che queste persone si siano domandate, almeno un giorno nella vita, se questa sia un dono oppure no.<br>  Forse, ma questa per me è molto più che una probabilità, l'unica ragione per cui la vita è un dono è l'amore. Almeno in questo posso definirmi cristiano, con la differenza che io estendo il concetto di amore a tutta la vita che anima il nostro universo. Vedi, se tu conoscessi una persona con un cancro allo stadio terminale e fossi capace di stargli vicina, amarlo e dargli la tua vita per quel breve periodo di vita che ancora gli rimane, non penserebbe che quegli istanti sono il dono più bello che la vita potesse dargli, nonostante il suo dolore? E' per questo che tutti quei valori sciocchi ed effimeri, dai quali siamo continuamente bombardati, hanno valore zero davanti al dolore. E per dolore intendo non solo quello di un essere umano la cui gioia è solo parziale se non ridotta al minimo perchè la sorte gli è stata avversa, ma anche quello di innocenti essere scuoiati vivi per ricoprire con la loro pelliccia la vanità degli esseri umani. Intendo il dolore delle creature torturate nei laboratori per una ricerca che va alla cieca e che non è vera scienza dal momento che contempla solo le strade che più le fanno comodo. Intendo il dolore di chi subisce le soluzioni di pochi individui depravati e degradati che considerano la violenza e la guerra quale unica soluzione di dialogo fra le comunità. Ed intendo il dolore di questo pianeta, in cui viviamo, le cui risorse sono sfruttate fino all'inverosimile ed in modo illogico, spesso soltanto per gli interessi di pochi stati potenti che rifiutano di pensare a soluzioni intelligenti per salvaguardarne la vita.<br>  Come vedi, la soluzione potrebbe essere riposta solo in un atto d'amore, in questo come in un altro caso. Un atto d'amore quotidiano verso tutta la vita in tutte le sue forme, insomma un esercizio dello spirito per cambiare se stessi e predisponendo la propria vita alla comprensione dell'altro, all'apprezzamento dell'altrui vita ed alla solidarietà. Troppo spesso viviamo alla giornata ripetendo ossessivamente i medesimi, identici atti. Ma se passassimo dalla teoria alla pratica scopriremmo che ogni giorno potremmo donare questa nostra consapevolezza a chi non ce l'ha o non potrà più averla, ed ogni piccolo nostro contributo, ogni piccola goccia di quest'acqua potrebbe investire porzioni più ampie fino a creare un oceano. Anche noi ne saremmo investiti.<br>  Forse allora la vita potrà essere considerata davvero un dono.<br>  Con ciò non credo di aver fornito una soluzione univoca e definitiva alla tua domanda, anche perchè non ho affrontato il problema del diritto all'eutanasia o il "diritto" al suicidio. <br>  In questi casi posso solo pensare che per molti individui la vita sia insostenibile comunque ed in ogni caso, a prescindere dall'amore altrui e dal senso di amore che ancora li pervade nei confronti della vita. <br>  A questo proposito credo che l'unica cosa ragionevole sia il rispetto verso le decisioni di questi individui, anche se dovessimo essere in disaccordo con i loro gesti estremi. E questo a prescindere dall'essere cristiani, atei o agnostici o scettici.|`|02f9e41ec4117427f668529571e335c3aa	la vita e' un dono di Dio (solo per chi ci crede),quindi i credenti sono tenuti a comportarsi di conseguenza.<br>  Per i non credenti la vita e' qualcosa di inipiegabile,quindi si comportino di conseguenza.<br>  <br>  P.S. ora parlo da credente,e' davvero triste che la nostra vita sia inispiegabile alchimia,quindi non ci sarebbe futuro spirituale,e di conseguenza nulla dopo,e nulla prima.<br>  Quindi i non credenti vivono ,soffrono,e muoiono per nulla.|`|2f9edcffe6e5690ba7f8cfef3dcbd3d9aa	Quello che accade ad una persona, può essere capitato anche a te in altre vite passate questa è la vita che noi nelle nostre incarnazioni dobbiamo subire la sofferenza, tribolazione come la gioia e la consolazione è legge di natura, il Dio non centra niente.<br>  Anche te puoi diventare Dio e quando lo sarai cosa pensi di fare a queste creature?

Ma chi la mai detto che le malattie sono un dono di Dio??è una bugia, che ti porta a credere che Dio è crudele e che non ama le sue creature.. La chiesa cattolica te lo può anche propinare, ma ciò è contrario alla Parola di Dio... Gesù sulla croce ci ha donato la GUARIGIONE infatti " PER LE SUE LIVIDURE SIAMO STATI GUARITI"(1Pietro2:24). E' facile accusare Dio di essere responsabile dei nostri problemi, ma è l' uomo la causa del proprio male..il peccato porta alla morte, alle malattie, alla distruzione psicologica...è uno scudo che separa l'uomo da Dio, perciò Lui non può intervenire(LUI CI LASCIA LIBERI DI SCEGLIERE SE STARE CON LUI O NO!!!). Solo attraverso il sacrificio di Cristo noi possiamo ricevere ogni benedizione. Credendo a Lui con il nostro cuore e dichiarando con la nostra bocca che è il nostro signore e salvatore (romani10:9-10). Non arrabbiarti con Dio se accadono cose brutte.. ma chiede a Dio di rivelarti il suo amore, leggi la sua Parola, e vedrai che Dio non è affatto un giudice cattivo, ma scoprirari quanto ci ama e il suo desiderio di aiutarci nelle difficoltà|`|a8aea186f1f1334dbb5c493630e01a86aa	le domande che poni, sono vecchie quanto il mondo, magari tu ti sentirai un critico "arguto"...<br>  <br>  la vita è un DONO?: se lo chiedi alla Chiesa, cosa vuoi ti risponda? la straordinarietà della vita sta nel fatto che se lo chiedi ad una tipologia di "disgraziato" da te elencato, troveresti qualcuno che ti risponde con le stesse parole di un prete in perfetta salute e condizione ...<br>  <br>  DIO sceglie di farci soffrire: cosa vuol dire?? quando l'ha detto??<br>  <br>  DIO, sta nei fatti della vita, ci ha dato, casomai, il libero arbitrio ... ciascuno è libero di scegliere del proprio destino ...<br>  <br>  l'unico POTERE che si è riservato sono i MIRACOLI!!!

Guarda Andrea Bocelli, non vedente e padre felice di due figli!

2qs2lbqFaa	Sono esempi di virtù umana, esempi di come condurre una vita rivolta verso il prossimo e fiduciosi verso ciò che fanno e pensano. Il pregarli come fossero Dio...è questo che mi lascia perplessa. Uno dei comandamenti che i cattolici imparano a memoria non è forse "io sono il Signore Dio tuo e non avrai altro Dio all'infuori di me"? E allora perché pregare altri invece che lui? Probabilmente perché noi uomini riusciamo ad immaginare meglio un Dio se prima lo abbiamo "vissuto" e se sappiamo che come noi lui ha vissuto. Immaginare "per fede" l'esistenza di qualcuno di grande e potente è più difficile per gli uomini.

Francesco, ma non ne ho affatto per S. roberto bellarmino, il quale fu un santo, un dottore della chiesa , un inquisitore ed un assasino;fu infatti lui a mandare a morte Giordano bruno. La medesima opinione ho di personaggi quali S.Cirillo di Alessandria, mandante dell'assasinio della scenziata Ipazia, oppure di S.Bernardo di chiaravalla, che fu un antisemita e fu il promotore della II crociata, e di tanti altri personaggi simili sui quali non mi dilungo per questioni di tempo.<br>  per quanto riguarda i santi che tu citi, la mia opinione su di  loro probabilmente non ti piacerà, ma io cerco di vedere i fatti; Padre pio fu al centro di diversi complotti politici, e la sua biografia me lo fa apparire come un personaggio quantomeno poco chiaro; madre Teresa di calcutta mi è simpatica ancora meno, sia per la sua abitudine di battezzare contro la propria volonta i degenti che lei accudiva in ospedali quantomeno fatiscenti ( riservando a sè - pare - cliniche di ben altro tenore) sia per aver affermato che tra Galileo - personaggio che fu inquisito da S. roberto bellarmino, fra la'ltro - e l'inquisizione avrebbe scelto senza dubbio la seconda.saluti.|`|HAPxYkCkaa	Ammiro moltissimo la loro persona, uomini che davvvero si sono dati in tutto e per tutto per il prossimo....vero esempio di amore universale!!|`|b536c8e14ed51cfe62ac9ab8ee215f46aa	ESATTO !!!<br>  <br>  <br>  -----------------------------<br>  Per la richiedente:sei tu che lo dici ....!!!<br>  <br>  --------------------------------<br>  Io non dico niente, sei tu che lo dici,<br>  <br>  Come rispose quel tale davanti al proconsole Romano....
c75ed8a7a115261761146604c70a9044aa	Ciao Elenina..prima di tutto mi spiace x il bimbo di quella famiglia e speriamo in bene.<br>  Sebbene le motivazioni religiose dei TdG siano state ben espopste  dalle risp precedenti, volevo segnalarti questo sito <a href="http://web.genie.it/utenti/f/francesco.zanolli/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://web.genie.it/utenti/f/francesco.z...</a><br>  <br>  Nn so se hai fatto caso alla prima scritta che appare in corsivo "La trasf più sicura è quella che si è riusciti ad evitare"..<br>  I dottori questo lo sanno, ma sanno anche che qui in italia si rischia di finire male (parlo di denuncie anche pesanti) se nn si è fatto TUTTO il possibile x salvare una vita. Inoltre un medico preferisce tamponare la situazione e rendere stabile SUBITO un paziente e questo a volte puo' richiedere appunto una trasf.<br>  Alla luce di ciò si possono trovare 2 tipi di medici:<br>   - quelli che vogliono il paziente subito stabile e se ne fregano delle convinzioni religiose/morali che uno ha;<br>   - quelli che tengono conto prima di tutto del benessere mentale del paziente e fanno di tutto e applicano anche medicina sperimentale cercando in tutti i modi di evitare quelle terapie che il paziente nn vuole (in questo caso le trasf)<br>  <br>  Il secondo tratta il paziente come una persona, il primo lo tratta come paziente, in modo distaccato e freddo.<br>  <br>  Il sito che t ho dato t fa anche vedere quante complicazioni una trasf puo' dare, e spesso i medici che appartengono alla prima categoria pensano che qualcun'altro risolvera' tali problemi... e se poi dovesse cmq morire basta che nn succeda quando c'e' lui come responsabile.<br>  <br>  Ancora una cosa:io sono un talassemico intermedio, nn faccio trasf xk' nn ne ho bisogno. Ma ci sono altri nella mia situazione con l'emoglobina molto piu' bassa che cmq nn fanno trasf e prendono un farmaco che stimola la produzione di emoglobina. Questo farmaco nasce x curare il cancro e ha pesanti effetti collaterali (tra cui quello benefico sopraelencato). Quindi come vedi anche i dottori che comunemente usano il sangue x curare i loro "ragazzi", se c'è la possibilita preferiscono nn trasfondere ma usare farmaci alternativi.|`|21a3590194806a3ba95fbaadaab95b4faa	Si è vero. Infatto una mia amica è testimone di geova ed ha un tesserino medico dove dichiara che, in caso di bisogno, non vuole praticare trasfusioni. Lei mi ha detto che per loro il sangue è vita, e non possono accettare il sangue di altri perchè sarebbe come rubare la loro vita. <br>  E' una cosa che non condivido, ma fatti loro, almeno lei sa quello che fa. Nel caso del bambino di cui dici non lo accetto perchè lui è ancora piccolo e penso voglia vivere, non è giusto prendere certe decisioni per lui.|`|42bf1e8d080df9a80b8dee93137fbe19aa	Ciao sono una Cristiana Testimone di Geova......e provero` a risponderti anche se ormai siamo giudiacati a priori.<br>  Forse volevi intendere che non accettano le trasfusioni, ma non che non lo vogliono curare.<br>  Il fatto che non accettiamo sangue non significa che rifiutiamo ogni tipo di cura. Vedi molti non sanno o non vogliono capire, o non credono, che in molti casi ci si puo` curare benissimo e senza complicazioni, anche non accettando le trasfusioni, anche se in altri casi e` un po piu` complicato, ma questo solo perche` ci sono malattie che se preso o no il sangue sono mortali comunque. Il fatto che noi rifiutiamo il sangue, non significa che ci lasciamo morire cosi, ma anzi cerchiamo sempre d' essere ben informati, ci crediate o no, su terapie, cure e nuove tecniche per poterci curare nei migliori dei modi senza prendere il sangue, la prova ne e` il fatto che milioni di Testimoni di Geova anno avuto operazioni, cure e terapie senza sangue, e continuano a vivere senza nessun problema. Tutti sono e possono essere liberissimi di scegliere le cure da seguire Testimoni di Geova o non. Veniamo spesso accusati di far morire i nostri bambini.....pero` mi chiedo se veramente molti si rendono conto di cio` che ci accusano, credete veramente che siamo cosi` meschini, ignobili e senza cuore per desiderare la morte di un nostro figlio, di un bambino qualsiasi o di una persona? Io non so che malattia ha questo Bambino e mi dispiace molto.......Mi chiedo........potete almeno immaginare la sofferenza che qualsiasi genitore puo` provare in una tragedia del genere nella propria famiglia? Capisco che non si e` daccordo con la nostra opinione ma almeno un po` di rispetto per i sentimenti altrui. Non abbiamo un cuore di pietra, abbiamo sentimenti come tutti voi.<br>  <br>  Il sangue e` vero che ha guarito molte persone ma e` stata anche la causa di gravi malattie che hanno causato ugualmente dolore e sofferenza per il resto della vita di coloro che ne sono stati affette, fino al giorno della loro morte.<br>  Il sangue non fa miracoli....<br>  <br>  Vuoi sapere perche` rifiutiamo il sangue????<br>  Bene provero` a spiegarti in breve<br>  <br>  Il motivo principale e` perche` e` un comando Bibblico. In base alla scrittura di Atti 15:28-29 "......che vi asteniate dalle cose sacrificate agli idoli e dal sangue e da ciò che è strangolato e dalla fornicazione. Se vi asterrete attentamente da queste cose, prospererete. State sani!”<br>  Qui il mangiar sangue è equiparato all’idolatria e alla fornicazione, cose che non vorremmo certo commettere.<br>  E poi specifica di astenersi dal sangue (in generale) e non solo dal sangue animale, (Levitico 17:10)<br>  <br>  Un' altra cosa e` che il sangue è sacro agli occhi di Dio. Dio dice che l’anima, o vita, è nel sangue. Perciò è sbagliato mangiare sangue. è sbagliato anche mangiare la carne di un animale che non è stato dovutamente dissanguato.<br>  <br>  Questo significa che non dobbiamo assolutamente immettere nel nostro corpo sangue altrui e neanche il nostro proprio sangue che sia stato conservato. (Atti 21:25) Perciò i veri cristiani non accetteranno trasfusioni di sangue. Accettiamo pero` altri tipi di terapia, come la trasfusione di prodotti non ematici. Il fatto che andiamo a curarci significa che vogliamo vivere, ma non infrangendo le leggi di Dio. Matteo 16:25.<br>  <br>  Si può davvero equiparare una trasfusione al mangiare sangue?<br>  <br>  Ti faccio un' esempio, in ospedale, quando un paziente non può essere alimentato per via orale, viene alimentato per via endovenosa. Ebbene, se uno che non ha mai preso sangue per via orale lo accettasse sotto forma di trasfusione, ubbidirebbe al comando di ‘astenersi dal sangue’? (Atti 15:29) Prendiamo il caso di una persona a cui il medico abbia detto di astenersi dall’alcool. Rispetterebbe il divieto se smettesse di bere alcool ma se lo facesse trasfondere direttamente nelle vene?<br>  No non lo rispetterebbe perche` risulterebbe esattamente la stessa cosa.<br>  <br>  Il fatto che rifiutiamo il sangue non e` come molti pensano, per mancanza d'ampre per il nostro prossiamo e non e` vero che non ci sono altre cure alternative per ALCUNE malattie che un tempo risualtavano mortali. Ci sono poi molte terapie e cure che ogniuno di noi puo` scegliere di accettare o rifiutare in base alla propria coscienza.<br>  <br>  Su questi link puoi trovare ulteriori informazioni, e anche i metodi che accettiamo per essere curati.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.watchtower.org/i/20000108/article_02.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtower.org/i/20000108/art...</a><br>  <br>  Medicina e chirurgia senza sangue alcune metodiche usate.<br>  <a href="http://www.watchtower.org/i/20000108/diagram_01.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtower.org/i/20000108/dia...</a><br>  <br>  Medicina senza sangue nuovo “standard in campo terapeutico”?<br>  <a href="http://www.watchtower.org/i/20000108/diagram_02.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtower.org/i/20000108/dia...</a><br>  <br>  Medicina e chirurgia senza sangue sono sempre più richieste.<br>  <a href="http://www.watchtower.org/i/20000108/article_03.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtower.org/i/20000108/art...</a><br>  <br>  Ciao e grazie.|`|67a63154ad765390dfa605efa98acc3daa	Purtroppo sono appartenenti ad una setta che applica alla lettera l'A.T. <br>  Nell'A.T. il sangue era considerato impuro e anche nei sacrifici di animali gli stessi venivano dissanguati prima che le loro carni fossero consumate. <br>  Purtroppo i Tdg sono privi di spirito critico (salvo quello rivolto agli altri) e questo divieto ne è una conseguenza. <br>  La scelta di violare la libertà altrui (compresa quella dei loro figli), privandoli della vita nell'impedire cure invasive come una trasfuzione, è irragionevole e dimostra, fuor di dubbio,  la loro poca propensione all'uso della ragione.|`|2ee9932c7a324467b84e1f4c1564a21caa	Cara non approfondisco la cosa perchè ti confessio che sto scappando perchè è tardi per me...ma io sono un Cristiano Testimone di Geova e ti assicuro che noi non accettiamo sangue e derivati...ma ci sono tantissimi metodi alternativi che sostituiscono le emotrasfusioni quindi il bimbo puo usufruire di questi metodi pur non andando contro il comando di "stenersi dal sangue"|`|894vVbhwaa	Anche secondo me è molto crudele!

(Magari basandosi sul capitolo Giuda, 9... In cui si legge: con voce d'arcangelo, dove si intende con voce stentorea e possente.)<br>  Il cristiano è colui che imita il Cristo, nelle azioni e nei pensieri, evitando di fomentare odio tra i suoi simili se non fa parte del proprio credo.|`|bc496853bed3e0dd54bcecb81e909827aa	Mi fa sorgere tanti dubbi...|`|5a3b34ea18a07d4fc0284bc4607fd24faa	penso che vivere da cristiano richieda una certa coerenza, per questo è una parola che mi fa storcere un po' il naso, dato che ho visto davvero troppe ma troppe persone dichiararsi cristiane nella loro ipocrisia.|`|a03ac5f531d1c4e11199b839fa5c0cc2aa	nessuna.. io lo sono.<br>  mi dà invece una reazione il tuo avatar!.. è stranissimo!|`|aea4d022372b2e5ed1d458155057248baa	Risplende di luce propria questa meravigliosa parola di nove lettere: " Cristiano"- parola di fede e amore IL cui significato è : " appartengo a Cristo"- E' una scelta consapevole verso un amore speciale perchè unico- fatto di protezione, comprensione e perdono. Nella Bibbia Cristo dice :" Siate miei imitatori.."- Cioè perseverate come Me nella fede verso IL Padre Mio, dice Gesù- Essere cristiani così come desidera Cristo non è cosa facile. Troppo spesso Le persone is auto-definiscono cristiane, ma non lo sono veramente. Prova, per un attimo, a pensare quando TU chiami dottore un uomo Della medicina? Che strada percorre quell'uomo? Quanti studi deve fare? Il suo cammino non è facile, ma TU non lo chiamerai mai dottore, finchè non avrà conseguito la laurea. Vero? Ed è giusto che sia così, non penso che metteresti la tua fiducia nelle mani di un idraulico per farti operare di appendicite,,ma darai a ognuno IL suo compito. Diventare Cristiano è un lungo cammino disseminato di sassi aguzzi. ..CIOè di problemi, ostacoli, dolori..mentre camminiamo possiamo cadere, inciampare, uscire di strada..Ma la Parola di Dio avverte che questo Cristo lo as e la Sua felicità sta nel vederti rialzare DA terra, nel ricominciare di nuovo con fede ritrovata. Tutti possiamo sbagliare e Dio lo sa, non c'è perfezione sotto questo cielo dice Cristo. Se così non fosse non aveva motivo Dio di diventare carne in Cristo Gesù e morire per noi. Se anche ci fosse stato uno solo degli uomini atti allo scopo supremo di salvezza, sicuramente Dio lo avrebbe utilizzato così come ha fatto con Gesù. Per tutto questo e molto altro ancora, quando penso alla parola Cristiano, la mia reazione è di rispetto per quella persona speciale che combatte tutti i giorni la sua battaglia per rimanere fedele a Cristo. Ogni giorno nel mio cuore nasce questa domanda :" Come potrei allontanarmi da Te Gesù ", nulla avrebbe senso, Tu sei colui che mi perdona, mi ama, mi aiuta e quando casco mi rialza...PER AMORE..SOLO PER AMORE ,, NESSUN UOMO è COME te GESù, NESSUNO PUò DARE UN AMORE COSì GRANDE...TUTTI MI POSSONO LASCIARE, TUTTI MI POSSONO DELUDERE...MA Dio no!!!

Al tempo della Bibbia non esisteva la possiblità di prolungare una vita artificialmente come facciamo noi adesso e di conseguenza l'eutanasia era sempre un omicidio. Ora bisogna prima di tutto riuscire a capire fino a quando si agisce correttamente nel mantenere in vita un individuo e quando invece si sconfina nel prolungare artificialmente la sofferenza per la vanagloria di noi medici che non vogliamo ammettere la sconfitta e l'egoismo di parenti che preferiscono avere vicino un corpo caldo ma inanimato rispetto ad una fredda lapide. Se non ci si ferma a trovare una soluzione a questo problema pressante di bioetica tutto quello che viene detto dalla chiesa verrà sempre contrastato e nello stesso tempo si lascia il campo libero a personaggi che, cavalcando la tigre della libertà, cercano di far passare leggi che consentono di liberarci di chiunque non corrisponda alla nostra idea di salute e felicità. Noi non possiamo sapere cosa passa nella testa di persone con gravi handicap, anche se ci sembra che soffrano alcuni di loro sono felici di vivere e non abbiamo il diritto di privarli di quello che hanno, anche se è pochissimo. D'altro canto non è neppure giusto esagerare nel mantenere parvenze di vita che vita non sono. Sono cattolica tanto e quanto te, se non di più, e ho dovuto nella mia vita staccare la spina a pazienti oramai clinicamente morti e ti dico che, anche sapendo che era tutto finito, è un'esperienza orribile; però ritengo che se non si affronta a pieno la questione, chiarendo bene i limiti dell'accanimento terapeutico non si uscirà mai da questa diatriba.<br>  A proposito, per quello che possiamo fare lo Spirito santo non riusciamo a ucciderlo.|`|757e998dde3617e3d90ea9fcb9fec5f7aa	Tu che parli tanto come vorrei che ti trovassi in quelle situazioni a vivere come un vegetale!!!!!!<br>  Allora sì che capiresti....<br>  Io delle str.. che sono scritte nella bibbia che Adamo ed Eva hanno magnato le mela me ne frego, sai com'è nel 2007 ho altre cose a cui pensare, invece che a questi raccontini mitologici...|`|8868d7c9e8d266094f651e34540512fcaa	nel vostro inferno brucerete solo voi filo-papa del c.a.z.z.o.!!!|`|9bd483ed26228f2d38b057882dbdfe6eaa	Ti riporto la risposta che ho già dato ad una domanda simile -anche se molto più sensata -ossia "cosa pensate dell'eutanasia?"<br>  Io risposi in questo modo:<br>  <br>  Se la vita è un diritto, deve essere possibile, se lo si desidera, rinunciare a questo diritto. Io sono assolutamente d'accordo con l'introduzione dell'eutanasia in italia. Non riuscirei mai a vivere immobile su un letto dalla testa in giù, e potendo vedere la vita che mi passa davanti, senza poter far nulla. per me sarebbe una tortura insopportabile.<br>  Nei film western, si ha pietà dei cavalli...perchè non si deve avere la stess pietà di un essere umano, quando questi lo desidera?<br>  <br>  <br>  Ti consiglierei di provare a restare immobile dal collo -anzi dagli occhi -in giù per un'ora, soltanto un'ora. E ricordati -ammesso che tu riesca a stare perfettamente immobile per un'ora - che il tuo diaframma si muove autonomamente, e questo non è il caso di molti costretti a letto immobili e legati ad unrespitaro artificiale, ma coscienti e condannati da quel tuo dio "così buono" ( e ci sarebbe molto da discutere) a vedere la vita che gli passa davanti.<br>  Scendi dal tuo piedistallo - che fra l'altro si basa su fondamenta poco salde - e mettiti per un'ora nei panni di chi non è fortunato come te, che può tranquillamente esprimere le sue quantomeno strane idee al PC e che invece deve dipendere da un respiratore artificiale, un cuore artificiale, un "cibo" -se così si può dire - che gli viene iniettato nelle vene.<br>  <br>  Pensaci prima di fare queste provocazioni di pessimo gusto e prive della pietà e del rispetto degli altri.<br>  <br>  E ovviamente, quanto dico per te dovrebbe valere anche per il papa -che non mostra alcuna pietà per chi sta male sul serio - e per Ruini, "nomen omen", vista l'assonanza  del suo cognome con il termine latino per "rovina",<br>  <br>  Ah...e prima di pontificare sulla morale, studiati la storia della chiesa: è letteralmente costellata di sangue.

E' quasi tabu'.<br>  <br>  Una donna pero' puo' dire "I love you" per "ti voglio bene" ad un'altra donna. Ad un uomo, quando una donna dice "I love you", vuol dire "ti amo". Per dire "ti voglio bene" [ma con "non mi piaci pero' " sottinteso], si dice "I'm really fond of you" (non e' rarissimo) oppure "You're a really good friend / nice bloke", oppure "I really value our friendship" (piu' formale).<br>  <br>  In Inghilterra, i parenti non si dicono "I love you", a meno che non siano genitori che parlano ai bambini (o viceversa), o sposati.

The continents were hugging in a ring around the equator...not like today. The continents drifted further apart as the human race drifted.

Other fragments are under water.<br>  <br>  The grid collapsed & Gaia shifted on her axis, the gravity shifted & caused near-by Atlantis (generic-Antarctica)to get pulled to the south pole & the continents to split & grow apart.

One of the more common ways participants attempt to make her appear is to stand before a mirror in the dark (most commonly in a bathroom) and repeat her name three times, though there are many variations. Some include chanting a hundred times, chanting at midnight, spinning around, rubbing one's eyes, or chanting her name thirteen times with a lit candle. Most of these are meant to disorient people. In some versions of the legend, the summoner must say, "Bloody Mary, I killed your son!" or "I killed your baby." In these variants, Bloody Mary is often believed to be the spirit of a mother (often a widow) who murdered her children, or a young mother whose baby was stolen from her, which made her go mad in grief and she eventually committed suicide. In stories where Mary is supposed to have been wrongly accused of killing her children, the querent might say "I believe in Mary Worth." This is similar to another game involving the summoning of the Bell Witch in a mirror at midnight. Similar rituals are also used to summon spirits in the movies Beetlejuice (1988) and Candyman (1992). The game is often a test of courage, as it is said that if Bloody Mary is summoned, she would proceed to kill the summoner in an extremely violent way, such as ripping his or her face off, scratching his or her eyes out, driving the person insane or bringing the person into the mirror with her. Other variations say that the querent must not look directly at her, but at her image in the mirror; she will then reveal the querent's future, particularly concerning marriage and children.<br>  <br>  Bloody Mary Worth is typically described as a child-murderer who lived in the locality where the legend has taken root years ago. There is often a specific local graveyard or tombstone that becomes attached to the legend.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, various people have surmised that the lore about taunting Bloody Mary about her baby may relate her tenuously to folklore about Queen Mary I. [3][4]The queen's life was marked by a number of miscarriages or false pregnancies. Had Mary I successfully borne a child, this would have established a Roman Catholic succession and threatened the continuance of her religious persecutions after her death. Speculation exists that the miscarriages were deliberately induced. As a result, some retellings of the tale make Bloody Mary the queen driven to madness by the loss of her children. [5] It is likely, however, that Queen Mary I provided only her nickname to the Bloody Mary of folklore. She is also confused in some tellings of the story with Mary Queen of Scots. Bloody Mary is sometimes said to have bathed in the blood of her child victims (or more commonly the blood of virgins) in order to retain a youthful complexion; this would appear to confound her with Elizabeth Báthory.<br>  <br>  The mirror ritual by which Bloody Mary is summoned may also relate to a form of divination involving mirrors and darkness that was once performed on Halloween. While as with any sort of folklore the details may vary, this particular tale encouraged young women to walk up a flight of stairs backwards, holding a candle and a hand mirror, in a darkened house. As they gazed into the mirror, they were supposed to be able to catch a view of their future husband's face. There was, however, a chance that they would see the skull-face of the Grim Reaper instead; this meant, of course, that they were destined to die before they married.<br>  <br>  The appearance of a ghostly figure in the mirror could be explained quite easily for the more complex rituals, for example spinning around whilst summoning Bloody Mary in front of a mirror lit by candles. The combination of dizziness, rapid movement and flickering lighting could easily fool the eye into seeing someone, especially when the idea has already been implanted. The participant may think that they have seen a spirit, it is, however, most likely a trick of the eye brought upon by the combination of darkness and fear.|`|YpXvSpEZaa	waste your time lol just a game to scare little kids =P

ZCc7hOFBaa	Ciao, Ti ho letto spesso e quindi della Tua osservazione mi interessa veramente tanto sapere perché percepisci nei verbi in -IRE un senso di finito (tecnicamente si dice un aspetto perfettivo) del verbo.<br>  Se hai letto qualche mia domanda/risposta forse saprai che sono un glottologo, quindi la Tua osservazione mi fa pensare.<br>  <br>  Un verbo perfettivo esprime un'azione finita o non ripetibile.<br>  Quindi, per esempio, finire, morire. Ma dormire? partire, venire eccetera?<br>  <br>  La mia risposta dal punto di vista tecnico é un po' piú semplice. Tutti (spero) avranno notato che i verbi in -ERE ed -IRE sono estremamente irregolari, e quelli in -ire piú di quelli in -ere, vista la sdoppiatura della terza flessione verbale  in -O ( par-tire / part-o) e -ISCO ( fin-ire / fin-isco)..<br>  La prima coniugazione é non solo la piú numerosa ma anche quella quasi sempre regolare. I neologismi verbali vengono di solito flessi seguendo la coniugazione in -are e seguendo lo schema regolare che la contraddistingue.<br>  Le irregolalitá verbali sono il frutto dei seicoli, e crearne una a tavolino é abbastanza improbabile.<br>  <br>  Questo a livello linguistico.<br>  <br>  Poi c'é la Tua equazione. E valutandola direi allora che il verbo dovrebbe essere "diffettivo", ossia uno di quelli che col tempo (in questo caso con la ragione) ha perso dei "pezzi" per strada, ossia dei tempi composti, come soccombere, prudere, splendere , incombere, delinquere, stridere , dirimere  (quasi tutti in -ere) ecc. mancando del participio passato (quindi il tempo perfettivo per eccellenza). Non potendo questi ultimi esprimere uno stato passato, allora sarebbero giusto metterci il verbo clonEre, il quale fará sí clono, al futuro clorró (perché in verbi in -NERE escono cosí, vedi teNERE / terró), ma non portrá mai esprimere l'azione accaduta. Dunque la situazione migliore e l'equazione cambierebbe in:<br>  <br>  Clonere mai accaduto = conclusione dell'evoluzione dell'uomo scongiurata per un pelo .... anzi, per una E !<br>  <br>  Saluti<br>  .|`|038b609b0749221a540a3afe0856469faa	per me va bene la prima coniugazione, visto che clonazione=evoluzione...|`|ovkrasWbaa	perchè tuanonnaincarriola|`|5c329ce31a4b8ec959acab6c485feeacaa	prima coniugazione perche finisce in are? poi cè ere la 2a e ire la 3a. mi ricordo cosi|`|7684d485bdc15f17e82f58c753960a94aa	scler-"are"...impazz-"ire"...|`|94ea9275656d7a65a5471fc88da407beaa	Hai ragione...azz'...e io che pensavo di avere le pippe mentali peggiori di tutti!!!!!

However, science has also changed science ... and there is not as much distance between science and religion as some would like to promote.

AA12275506	Since Jehovah God does not make mistakes, his regretting manifestly refers to a change in attitude toward humans. Just what prompts such a change on his part?<br>  <br>  Take the situation in the days of Noah. At that time the earth was filled with violence. The Bible reports: “Jehovah saw that the badness of man was abundant in the earth and every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only bad all the time. And Jehovah felt regrets that he had made men in the earth, and he felt hurt at his heart.”—Gen. 6:5, 6.<br>  <br>  We are not to conclude from this that God felt that he had made a mistake in creating man. This could not be, for he pronounced all his creative works “very good,” measuring up to his standard of perfection. (Gen. 1:31) Rather, Jehovah regretted that humans had chosen to follow a course of disobedience. He regretted that they, with the exception of Noah and his immediate family, had become so corrupt that he was forced to take rightful action against them.|`|275b5793f9320bad5b3cee7f53afcf23aa	i think he made a mistake by killing just about every living thing on the planet, but thats just me|`|6870a59411ab50ebaac48b8c70d390bcaa	God feels no regrets, he is perfect and he is aware of every outcome before it happens.

And some of the rules are indeed unfair and unachievable and this casts a big shadow on the image of a benign, just and loving god.|`|d28818ca3ea9f1e4bc17f8831d8f7ff8aa	The "punishment" is having to reincarnate back to the physical plane into a set of circumstances that will teach you about your former actions.  Eventually, after getting knocked around enough, one begins to make the correct decisions and thereby creates good karma.  God gives each individual all the time they need to learn their lessons.  <br>  <br>  One should be accountable for all their actions, good and bad.  It's only fair.|`|66ge4Rzlaa	God is not about punishing people, He is about meeting our needs. He put The Spirit of truth inside us to show us the way. The Spirit of truth wants very much for you to know and understand yourself, God, and Jesus. God loves you unconditionally, it is a free gift. Gifts cannot be earned, only accepted or rejected. It is a process of rejecting evil and accepting the good. Accept responsibility for learning the truth as it is given to you.|`|b5b3a78cd70d9312849f0cb75028d94aaa	God wrote His Moral Law into your heart.

TJqMmKnsaa	I have 2 biracial nephews.  They were raised in the south and suffered the same treatment you mentioned above.  My sister and husband stressed to them the whole time they were coming up that, people like that were ignorant and it was the other persons loss for not getting a chance to know a fine young man like either one of them.  They also instilled into my nephews, the need to not surround yourself with ignorance as it weighs you down, mentally, emotionally, and physically.  You have to explain to your boys that the problem is not with the friends they made as much as with the pre-conceived prejudices their father has.  If they go to the same school you may want to speak with the Principal before it becomes an issue there.<br>  I wish I could tell you a magic solution but, sadly there is none.  Good luck.<br>  .|`|vvPL4f4Faa	My children are also biracial but they are grown (31,29,27). They need to understand...because they will be dealing with this the rest of their lives.

Think this out carefully (did you not think of this before you even had these children ?) because you are going to set the tone for how they deal with this the rest of thier lives. You want to encourage self-esteem without encouraging hatred in them for others. Speak to black people.....ones that have dealt with this successfully in thier lives....this is not a new problem and they will be able to give you the advice of generations of people.

c0998070bced6de899f7cc9ebe3780eeaa	Nach meinen Informationen wurde er von einem anderen Auto gerammt. Der andere war der Unfallverursacher.<br>  <br>  Er war sofort tot. Als die Rettungshelfer kamen, haben die noch eine Sauerstoffmaske aufgesetzt und daher kam das Gerücht auf, dass er überlebt h?tte und sich aus der ?ffentlichkeit zurück gezogen hat.<br>  <br>  Hier habe ich eine Textpassage zum Unfallhergang<br>  <br>  Auf der Gegenfahrbahn kam Dean und seinem Beifahrer Wütherich ein Ford entgegen. Dessen Fahrer Donald Turnupseed bog nach mehrmaligem Beschleunigen und Abbremsen mit seinem Wagen unvermittelt nach links ab, da er Deans Porsche nach eigener Aussage nicht kommen sah, und nahm Dean die Vorfahrt. James Dean hatte die Scheinwerfer des Porsches trotz Abendd?mmerung noch nicht eingeschaltet und keine Zeit, auszuweichen oder zu bremsen, und raste frontal in den Ford. Beim Aufprall brach sich Dean das Genick und starb noch auf dem Weg ins Krankenhaus. Der Porsche blieb in der Stra?enb?schung liegen; Wütherich war aus dem Fahrzeug geschleudert worden. Beide M?nner wurden in ein nahes Krankenhaus eingeliefert, in dem nur noch Deans Tod festgestellt werden konnte. Der 23-j?hrige Turnupseed erlitt einen Schock, und der Deutsche Wütherich brach sich den Kiefer und die Beine. Die berühmte Failure Analysis Associates in Menlo Park, Kalifornien, rekonstruierte den Unfall und stellte ihn in allen Einzelheiten noch einmal nach, ebenfalls an einem 30. September. Man kam zu dem Ergebnis, dass James nur 55 bis 56 Meilen pro Stunde gefahren war, als der fatale Unfall geschah. Das widerlegte das Gerücht, das besagte, er sei mit stark überh?hter Geschwindigkeit unterwegs gewesen. Wahrscheinlicher war demnach, dass Turnupseed den Unfall durch sein unschlüssiges Verhalten selbst verschuldet haben k?nnte. Der damals zust?ndige Amtsrichter sprach ihn allerdings von jeder Schuld frei|`|5SXQflhkaa	Eine M?gliche Geschichte steht hier:<br>  <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Dean#Fr.C3.BCher_Tod" rel="nofollow">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Dean#...</a>|`|90d362bdf266e7127cf34fe675ae088aaa	hallo,<br>  <br>   mal ehrlich wenn man selbst net dabei war kann man nur spekulieren. also was wirklich passierte wei? nur er allein.<br>  <br>  <br>  MfG, Stregana|`|df29ddcbbae3abce4d4149f58175e31aaa	Er starb...|`|nSxwBvZjaa	Guten Tag, mein Name ist Mr. Brian..<br>  und ich bin ein Spezialist für aussergew?hnliche Ph?nomene...<br>  es gab in der Geschichte der Menschheit immer Zeiten, da mussten wir Ausserirdischen eingreifen, weil es Menschen gab die zu intelligent für diese Welt waren.<br>  Wir haben getan was getan werden muss.<br>  Ich finde es unglücklich, dass das schon wieder thematisiert wird.....lasst james doch seinen Ruhestand geniessen...<br>  ohh..Elvis ruft an sorry..und ich muss dann noch auf die Party von Glen Miller....|`|efeba1a1206f9697451e42050a4d0506aa	Ganz einfach:<br>  Sein K?rper konnte die Aufprallgeschwindigkeit nicht vertragen!<br>  Tut ja schon weh, wenn ein Fu?g?nger vor ne Laterne latscht.<br>  Wahrscheinlich hat ihm das Lenkrad den Brustkorb zerquetscht.|`|d2dc861987019f55a9a744f05a01dc11aa	Ein Student wendete auf der Stra?e und Jimmy fuhr mit überh?hter Geschwindigkeit voll rein.

The fact that some people are not Christian doesn't mean they are not religious.  Furthermore, why do you complain about non-Christians arguing with you, when you initiate the argument by asking questions like this.  You don't see atheists going door-to-door trying to sell you on atheism do you.  I get a bible-thumper at my door at least once a week, inviting me to their church, trying to convince me that their religion is the right one, etc.  It's ridiculous.|`|8bc1419f3268344a5964f48cc6672e36aa	They do want to know more.|`|NIB3fFRTaa	I care because I believe Christians are being mislead.  I ask and answer here and in real life in order to help people see the contridictions between their own faith.<br>  <br>  I personally don't like to argue.  I perfer conversations.  Unfortunately, it has been my personal experience with Christians that any challenge to their faith is an attack and hence becomes an argument.  Not all Christians do this - but many I have met. <br>  <br>  And yes Christians do push their religion - becuase they believe it is the only way to be saved.  Which is admirable but irritates people who see the whole picture.<br>  <br>  I'll take my thumbs down now.|`|ff58445ffafe0ef7bb9c7aa4604c3221aa	Some might think that atheists would be content with simply not believing in God and leave the theists to themselves. After all, if God doesn't exist then what's the big deal? Why not let the theists believe in God the way a child believes in the tooth fairy? To the atheist, neither exists. So why bother?<br>  <br>  Even though many atheists don't care if people believe in God or not, others feel obligated to fight what I have often heard them label as "oppressive religious bigotry."  To this end, many of them are active in politics, social groups, the internet, and even use lawsuits to change society into a more atheistic temperament. They often consider Christians as a threat to freedom, common sense, and a good life. Consider this quote I found on an atheist web site at atheists.org. <br>  <br>  "We are constantly being overrun by people trying to get their ticket to Heaven at our expense, and if we don’t stand up and be counted we will lose the very freedom we hold most dear; freedom of thought..." <br>  This kind of statement is quite common in atheist circles.  It is inflammatory, illogical, and paranoid.  Many atheists I've spoken to tell me that I cannot think logically, that I am deluded, and that I believe in myths. They tell me that I am bound by foolish antiquated beliefs and need to abandon my religious bigotry and become a 'free thinker' like them.  In other words, they don't want me to think the way I do.<br>  <br>  Additionally, after reading much atheist material and debating with them over the internet, I've discovered that they often use mockery of God, religious leaders, and the Bible as weapons to further their agenda. This isn't the case with all atheists, as I have had very good conversations with some of them, but ridiculing attitudes are surprisingly prevalent and strong. Character assassination, half-truths, and out-of-context Bible quotes are typical tools used by many of them in attempts to make Christianity look bad.<br>  <br>  Now, I am not trying to dismantle the atheist position with a generic character attack aimed at them. I am only making on observation. In the majority of my dealings with atheists, I have encountered great arrogance, rudeness, and condescension. Atheists have told me that religion is only a giant con-game designed to get peoples' money, that clergymen are in business for themselves, and that I was mentally ill for believing in God. Following are some of their comments: <br>  <br>  "I do not want to be bound to archaic mythologies. This is the 20th century." <br>  "Christianity is an oppressive system used to control and manipulate people." <br>  "Logic demands that religion be proven wrong." <br>  "Christians should all be in mental wards." <br>  "We are free thinkers and not bound by outdated and oppressive myths." <br>  "Christians are sycophantic sheep." <br>  Atheists often imply that reason is best used by them and not by Christians who, many say, need psychological help for believing in God.  This condescending attitude is a fountain for derogatory comments.  I have been called stupid, absurd, illogical, and a slave to my religion. I get the impression from atheists that they are so convinced they have the truth that no other options are available to them and that if you don't agree with them, you're not smart. Of course, they will deny this and say I am being ridiculous, but this is what I have observed -- right or wrong.<br>  <br>  Consider some of the terms the atheists use to describe themselves: "Free thinkers," "Free from religion," "Rational," etc. They use these self-descriptive terms in juxtaposition to statements of Christians as religious bigots, losers, and brainwashers.  On the atheist.org website I read, <br>  <br>  "Critical thinking, objectivity, scientific methodology, and peer review are all hallmarks of Atheism. Submission, fear, credulity, and insupportable claims are the hallmarks of religious belief." <br>  When I read statements like this I can't help but wonder which religion they are referring to. It can't be Christianity because the Bible teaches us to love God and love our fellow man.  It teaches that the fear of the Lord is wisdom, that truthfulness is a way of life, and that eyewitness accounts of the miraculous is one of the evidences for its validity. Of course, the atheist would argue with all of this because he must, in spite of the facts. But still, if an atheist wants to attack religion in general and Christianity specifically, it should, at least, do so objectively. But this doesn't seem to be the hallmark of the atheistic movement; at least not from what I've seen so far.<br>  <br>  <br>  Consider the following statements from Atheists. <br>  <br>  "Godism is consistent with crime, cruelty, envy, hatred, malice, and uncharitableness." <br>  "As long as religious purposes are served, ethics, inquiry and reason are abandoned." <br>  Are these the statements of tolerance, impartiality, truth, and sound judgment?  Not at all. It seems to me that if the atheists who authored the above quotes were in power, with their views of religion being cruel, evil, and unreasonable, would they then either imprison the 'offenders' or legislate complete and total annihilation of all things religious?  Who would then be full of hatred, malice, and bigotry?  It is something to ponder. Does atheism really teach freedom?  No.  It teaches bondage for its adherents and for those who disagree with it.|`|oPPd7jFyaa	Ummm you are aware, this is not the "christian" catagory.... right?<br>  <br>  Christians don't hold the monopoly on religion and spirituality.  Although they think they do.  <br>  Perhaps you feel non chrisitans "care" so much about christianity because it's the most "in your face" religion?|`|tk1y8Tp9aa	As an Agnostic I like to question everything. I am exceedingly confused by Christians and there use of the word TRUTH. I can see the point of atheist's in that there information comes from science , and to the best of my knowledge science is honest. Some scientists may not be honest ( actually there not scientists if they are not honest ) but science is. I can see your point because some of the atheists can be spite-full and rude.<br>  <br>  Personally I abhor the teaching of Faith in the form of Facts and Truth to children. I think that by teaching children matters of faith ( dogmatic literature ) in the form of facts and truth you are robbing that child of the ability to have any real faith in God(s) , origin , or afterlife. And for them to have meaning at all it needs to be there decision. Sooo......<br>     In stead of being apathetic I chose to come here and answer questions in the hopes of helping the future generations and that makes me feel good.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Loin of Juda - I enjoyed reading your answer.

Some ask questions for the same reason that believers ask non believers questions, because they are curious. There is no reason why a  person of any belief should mind being ask a question about why they think the way they do about any subject. If you don't know why then don't answer.<br>  Debat is not arguement. <br>  Debat and discussion is not "pushing" our ideas on others. <br>  Christians try to get laws passed that require everyone to have to live according to the way they believe. That is pushing.<br>  A lot of harm has been done in the name of god.  Christians will do anything to put the fear of god into anyone who is of a different belief system.  Anyone who thinks not is ignorant of history and world events.<br>  What the bible teaches about tolerance and loving others is not what believers do. Most christians are intolerant to anyone who is not one of thier own kind.|`|AA12333649	Some people are actually open minded enough to learn about another religion instead of automatically opposing it because it doesn't fit their set of beliefs. <br>  <br>  Gee, what a concept!
AA12295759	I can see you've put a lot of thought into this serious question.<br>  <br>  The roots of the Judaeo-Christian/Islamic hostility to idols are in the Torah, the Jewish scripture (Old Testament) where God instructs the Israelites not to make or worship idols under pain of death. This, as I understand it, is because He was making the Jews a special holy people, consecrated to Him, and He had to make sure they did not become polluted by the practices of their neighbours.<br>  <br>  People of one religion (I'm a Christian) will readily suspect those of another of idol worship, while maintaining that they themselves merely use an aid to focussing. An idol can only be defined in the mind of the worshipper (or ultimately by God Himself).<br>  <br>  Most idols (false gods) are not made of stone or metal, but are things like sex, money, power or a particular interest or ideology.|`|96cd1744acaf1e87751ac1ec9c729b19aa	Because some religions don't like the competition.|`|Jav4nWgLaa	Because the Bible condemns the use of idols to contact/worship God.|`|IC9kMFaIaa	Most Christians don't pray at the foot of a cross. We pray to God when we're walking down the street, driving or wherever we are. Idols and objects of worship are denigrated because God commanded that we not fashion them. Period. Understanding why people have them has nothing to do with it. It's direct disobedience to God's command. God didn't want us to have an ocular reference, because He knew it soon would become the object of worship itself, and not Him. We are very visual beings. We believe our eyes. The focus on God would fade, and the idol would eventually become god.|`|JAAWNXjkaa	Psa 135:15The idols of the heathen [are] silver and gold, the work of men's hands.<br>  <br>  Psa 135:16They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not;<br>  <br>  Psa 135:17They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there [any] breath in their mouths.<br>  <br>  Psa 135:18They that make them are like unto them: [so is] every one that trusteth in them.|`|cgi7Hjhqaa	It is called Idol worship and bowing down to a statue  is forbidden in quite a few religions and God will send you to hell for it.|`|iRehe4Z8aa	Idol worship is denigrated by most Abrahamic monotheists because they are dualistic religions who detach God (even though Christ is the redeemer for ****'s sake, lol) from our Reality, whereas most Hindus are panentheistic, and their idols are the various aspects of Reality in their Real sacralised context. As such, Hinduism can be seen as a purer form of monotheism, as it is non-dualistic, affirming the one reality.

Extreme Zionists further believe that God's directive to rid that land of all non-Jews must be carried out, even to the extent of dedicating those peoples and all thir property to God (by destroying them, killing the people and animals, burning their towns).

This common origin explains their similarities in many beliefs and values <br>  <br>  <br>  However, over time the teachings of the various religions, due to a variety of reasons, have become distorted and mixed with made-man ideas. <br>  <br>  <br>  The last Prophet and Messenger of God, Muhammad , who is a direct descendant of Abraham through his first born son, Ishmael, was sent with the Last Guidance, Revelation and Testament, the Holy Qur'an(koran) to amend and correct the changes and corruption made to the the "Torah" which was sent to Moses and theTrue Gospel of Jesus.To say the truth ,God preserved all the other Holy Books plainly by preserving His Last Book the Holy Qur'an(koran)which contains the right and the truth of all that was changed in those other Books. <br>  <br>  <br>  This is why this last Revelation which was sent 1423 years ago has remained unchanged, not even a word or a letter has been altered. <br>  <br>  <br>  There is not even one word of difference between two Arabic Qur'ans, anywhere in the world. There has been no disagreements in history among Muslims as to what should and should not be in the Qur'an. However, in the case of the Bible, even the most ancient manuscripts conflict with one another so that no two are identical. Footnotes in all modern versions of the Bible prove this fact. <br>  <br>  <br>  These revisions serve as concrete proofs that all the Biblical books are not at all divinely inspired. This is because it is beyond man's ability to correct the work of his Creator, who alone is Almighty and perfect <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  It was only natural for Almighty God to preserve the scripture revealed to Prophet Muhammad, because he was the last Prophet and Final Messenger of God. <br>  <br>  <br>  Islam teaches us that we must pray directly to God without an intermediary and no soul can bear the burden of another and that the nature of humanity is good, and we did not inherit sin from Adam. Each soul comes into being free of sin.in Islam there are no priests or clergy -- each worshipper, man or woman, has a direct relationship with their Merciful Creator -- Almighty God. Since God is the Owner and Sustainer of everything, as well as the only one who can provide true and complete forgiveness, it is completely futile to try to approach Him through anyone else. <br>  <br>  <br>  The oneness and universality of God's message requires that people accept all the messengers of God. Rejecting one of them amounts to rejecting them all. The Jews reject Jesus's mission and Muhammad's mission; the Christians reject Muhammad's mission; whereas the Muslims accept them all, but reject incorrect historical interpretations and human elements in these missions. <br>  <br>  <br>  As the Qur'an is the final revelation and Muhammad is the final prophet, humanity is obligated to accept it: "If anyone desires a religion other than Islam, never will it be accepted of him; and in the Hereafter he will be in the ranks of those who have lost all spiritual good" (3:86). <br>  <br>  <br>  The Final Prophet Muhammad said: "Whoever believes there is no god but God, alone without partner, that Muhammad is His messenger, that Jesus is messenger of God, and that Paradise and Hell are true, shall be received by God into Heaven." <br>  <br>  <br>  you can do that now as you are reading these lines is to pronounce the two confirmations and attestations of faith, here it is <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I BEAR WITNESS THAT THERE IS NO GOD WORTHY OF WORSHIP EXCEPT ALLAH ( ARABIC WORD MEANS ONE GOD-THE CREATOR). AND I BEAR WITNESS THAT MUHAMMAD IS HIS SERVANT AND MESSENGER. I BEAR WITNESS THAT JESUS IS HIS SERVANT AND MESSENGER. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The right picture of lslam is conveyed in the Qur'an, which is exemplified by Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him. The reality is that it is not fair to judge a religion by the actions of its followers alone because there are good and bad followers in every religion. The correct thing to do is to judge a religion by its documented revelation from God and the prophet who brought that revelation. <br>  <br>  I encourage Christians and other religions to learn about Islam from Muslim sources and The Basis Of The Muslim Belief and not rely on second hand information which in many cases is distorted or contains a deep seated anti Muslim agenda. This is indeed a more scholarly approach <br>  <br>  <br>  For more info <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.islamdoor.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamdoor.com</a> <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thetruereligion.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.thetruereligion.org</a> <br>  <br>  <br>  BestWishes <br>  <br>  Your brother in humanity|`|b7ae34ab971653d02308ce805affb7baaa	If you must judge them then judge them by their followers...in which case Buddism wins hands down!<br>  I'm not a Buddist as that is a matter of faith - but you can't argue that they are not the least hypocritical of the major faiths!

Wir pochen darauf, dass der Staat sich für uns einsetzt, wir erwarten, dass unser Chef sich gerecht uns gegenüber verh?lt und wir erwarten von Mitmenschen, dass sie sich an Regeln halten, die allgemeingültig sind. Wir legen für unser Weltverst?ndnis moralische und logische Grunds?tze zugrunde, die uns eingebleut wurden - an die wir glauben und die wir verteidigen, obwohl wir sie vielleicht nicht einmal alle verstehen.<br>  Nun anzunehmen, dass "Gott" eine Instanz sei, die für uns sorgt und sich für uns einsetzt und sich dabei an UNSERE moralischen und logischen Grunds?tze h?lt, ist ein absolut gnadenloser Irrtum.<br>  Ich denke, daher kommt deine Frage?!

Jesu Auferstehung von den Toten), aber diese sind allesamt h?chst subjektiv. So ist z.B. die Auferstehung Jesu von der überwiegenden Mehrheit der zur betreffenden Zeit im direkten Umfeld lebenden Menschen nicht anerkannt worden. Die Gruppe von Menschen, die an die Auferstehung glaubten (!) und aus denen die sp?teren Christen wurden, war damals eine verschwindend kleine Minderheit. Objektive Hinweise w?ren heutzutage z.B. per Filmdokumentation gut zu belegen, aber sind (vielleicht gerade deshalb?) nicht existent.<br>  <br>  Objektive Hinweise gegen die Existenz Gottes:<br>  <br>  Hier müssen die religi?sen Aussagen über das Wesen und Wirken Gottes hinterfragt werden. <br>  <br>  Ein erster Hinweis gegen die Existenz Gottes ist die Unterschiedlichkeit und Widersprüchlichkeit der verschiedenen Aussagen, die die verschiedenen Religionen auf unserem Planeten dazu treffen. Das der europ?ische Kolonialismus das Christentum über die ganze Erde verbreitet und dadurch zur gr??ten Weltreligion gemacht hat, sollte nicht dazu verleiten, das christliche Gottesbild als wahrer anzunehmen, als z.B. die hinduistische G?ttervorstellung. <br>  <br>  Jedes Gottesbild für sich ist im Lichte des heutigen wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnisstandes um so mehr angreifbar, um so konkreter es wird. Um z.B. die christliche Sch?pfungsgeschichte auch nur teilweise beibehalten zu k?nnen, müssen christliche Kreationisten abenteuerlichste Begründungskonstrukte aufbauen (s. Intelligent Design), k?nnen aber trotzdem einer tieferen wissenschaftlichen Hinterfragung nicht standhalten. Die meisten christlichen Str?mungen, u.a. die evangelische und katholische Kirche, rudern deswegen schon seit vielen Jahren zurück, und verkünden inzwischen, dass die biblische Sch?pfungsgeschichte nicht wortw?rtlich, sondern nur im übertragenen Sinne zu interpretieren sei. <br>  <br>  Warum so viele Menschen (trotzdem) an Gott glauben:<br>  <br>  Ich bin nur einer von Milliarden Menschen auf diesem Planeten. Unsere Sonnensystem ist nur eine von vielen Milliarden in unserer Galaxie. Und unsere Galaxie ist nur eine von vielen Milliarden in diesem Universum. Wir sind also weniger, als ein Sandkorn in der Wüste. Mein Leben von vielleicht gerade mal hundert Jahren ist so gut wie nichts, gegenüber den zeitlichen Lebensdauern der Gestirne von mehreren Milliarden Jahren. Und wir sind verg?nglich, jeden Menschen erwartet am Ende der Tod. Und auch alle Menschen die uns kannten werden irgendwann nicht mehr sein. Und alles was wir gebaut und geschaffen haben wird irgendwann vergessen und zu Staub zerfallen sein.<br>  <br>  Diese Perspektiven der Winzigkeit und Ohnmacht k?nnen für uns Menschen ?u?erst erschreckend sein, aber für die meisten Gottgl?ubigen nicht ganz so sehr. Denn der allm?chtige Gott, der dieses riesige Universum nach seinem Willen geschaffen hat, der seit allen Zeiten und für alle Zeiten existieren wird, dieser Gott liebt mich. Er sorgt sich um mich und ich kann mich im Gebet an ihn wenden. Wer so eine pers?nliche Beziehung zum Sch?pfer des Universums aufbauen kann, der fühlt sich nicht mehr (so) ohnm?chtig, und wenn er das Gefühl der Ohnmacht bisher weitestgehend verdr?ngt hat, so wird er seine Beziehung zu Gott als unbeschreibliches Glücksgefühl empfinden. <br>  <br>  Fazit: <br>  <br>  Auch ich m?chte mich nicht ohnm?chtig fühlen und strebe nach Glück. Aber wer erstmal von der Frucht der Erkenntnis gekostet hat (und daher wei?, dass es keinen Gott gibt), der kann nicht mehr in das Paradies zurück und muss einen anderen und beschwerlicheren Weg finden, in diesem Leben einen befriedigenden Sinn zu finden...|`|PF2WnMdUaa	Natürlich gibt es Gott!Und wenn man genau die Bibel liest,dann findet man auch die Antworten!In der Bibel stehen so viele Dinge drin,die weit nach der Entstehung der Bibel passiert sind und die noch kommen werden!

The notion is that a myth is a "made up story" that our ancestors created because they didn't understand how the world was made or where they come from.<br>  <br>  In a deeper sense, however, myth is a part of our collective unconscious and as such is vital to our survival.  <br>  <br>  In many ways the stories that make up the Bible are myths in both senses of the word.  Scientific discovery and investigation have persuaded most people that the earth is not in the center of the universe and that the age of the planet is far in excess of Bishop Ussher's assessment.  On the other hand, the story of the mythic hero, separated from his father, going on a journey into the wilderness, dying and visiting the land of the dead before being united with his father in the land of the gods is one that fits Jesus very nicely.<br>  <br>  A look at Karl Jung's archetypes and Joseph Campbell's "The Hero's Journey" will testify to the power of myth in our lives.<br>  <br>  A more recent work "Why God Won't Go Away," by Andrew Newberg, explores myth in relation to the neurobiology of belief.  <br>  <br>  It's a fascinating field.|`|fe4f78149d0f2f31adafea10aaf25ee3aa	a false belief, an image which accounts for natural phenomena|`|4f50278773e4443646825a8545edb997aa	well, capital M MYTH for those that explain the big mysteries, like how the world came to be ... those that are foundational to a world view, and thougtht by many to be true.

The truth or falsehood is not implied by the word myth.  Using teh word to accurately describe stories from religions of long ago has given it the feel of falsehood but it really doesn't mean that.  The Bible is a book of myths, for Christians, these myths are truth, for the rest of us, they are false, regardless, they are still myths.|`|m9nUzEDsaa	A myth is defined as a story about the past that is told and retold in order to express certain values.  Myths should not pretend factual claims, but serve only to express certain values.  The proof of a myth is not whether some archaeologist can unearth evidence verifying the claim, but whether the values it conveys can be vindicated.<br>  <br>  People generally accept the word myth to mean something untrue, but the word isn't intended to mean the opposite of verified fact.  The truth in myths are the morals of the stories, not the factuality of events.

lTezdQgRaa	Persephone, in Greek mythology, daughter of Zeus, father of the gods, and of Demeter, goddess of the earth and of agriculture. Hades, god of the underworld, fell in love with Persephone and wished to marry her. Although Zeus gave his consent, Demeter was unwilling. Hades, therefore, seized the maiden as she was gathering flowers and carried her off to his realm. As Demeter wandered in search of her lost daughter, the earth grew desolate. All vegetation died, and famine devastated the land. Finally Zeus sent Hermes, the messenger of the gods, to bring Persephone back to her mother. Before Hades would let her go, he asked her to eat a pomegranate seed, the food of the dead. She was thus compelled to return to the underworld for one-third of the year. As both the goddess of the dead and the goddess of the fertility of the earth, Persephone was a personification of the revival of nature in spring. The Eleusinian Mysteries were held in honor of her and her mother. Proserpine was the Latin counterpart of Persephone.|`|2d8c234eb5b4b25bc772cbf048ae2b81aa	she is demeters daughter and was kidnapped by hades|`|AA11989027	Persephone is the goddess of the underworld<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persephone" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persephone</a>|`|b266ee5c193ec4459bd2886dd19dd68caa	Persephone is the daughter of Demeter, the Goddess of the Harvest, and wife of Hades, the God of the Underworld.  In the most famous myth involving her she and her mother were out in a field picking flowers when Hades came along and snatched Persephone away in his chariot and dragged her down to his underworld, where she became his queen.  Demeter, in mourning for her daughter, wept and let the world descend into winter.  A deal was struck thanks to intervention by the other Gods and Persephone spends half the year with Demeter, the other half with Hades.  The half she's with Hades Demeter is in mourning so the world is in winter, and when she's with her mother the world is in summer.|`|DwYBCtMuaa	yay greek question!! =) she is a greek goddess... wife of Hades, who is the God of the Underworld- hell|`|0cb378a7f909e57781dc923bfdf0d8dfaa	I could describe this complex Goddess to you, but I would not be doing her any justice.

bd9e0d5ccfe3e84dce8532cb323823e2aa	Ho postato una domanda sul male la settimana scorsa e riflettendo ho scritto questo:<br>  Il Pensiero cristiano ha mostrato che si è persona, prorpio perchè si hanno relazioni e che queste relazioni sono intessute d'amore, di responsabilità, fiducia, di fecondità.<br>  Eppure il MALE è proprio colui che non ha queste relazioni, colui che ha scelto e sceglie di rifuggire da ogni relazione d'moare, di gioia, di festa, anzi di insidiare (nella sua immensa astuzia, anche collocando tali relazioni sotto il marchio di errate e contro dio) quelle che esistono, colui che si è tagliato fuori da ogni fiducia da prestare a Dio e all'uomo. Il MALE è rabbia, tristezza, è il ghiaccio di una immobilità glaciale. Ad una analisi attenta il male si rivela tutt'altro che goduria, piacere, passione per la vita ma piuttosto come l'incapacità di gioire, di prendere parte.

Sempre Bene perchè diffonde in colui che lo adora generalmente positività e benessere. Qualora però l'uomo tende ad estremizzarlo allora in nome di Dio si potrebbe recare danni o malessere. In un brano dei CSI si diceva: "Non sono scrupoloso ai riguardi di Dio, è a nostra immagine e somiglianza...non sono scrupoloso ai riguardi di Dio, è a nostra immagine, somiglia a noi...".<br>  <br>  Qualora tu intenda il male come mancanza di salute, per esmepio, beh, allora questa è meramente scienza applicata ad una macchina imperfetta che è l'animale. Si che l'animale è stato secondo generalmente i vari credi creato da un Dio, ma qui si cadrebbe sulla pura filosofia. <br>  <br>  Concludo che se Dio è solo bene od è anche male è meramente una tua scelta personale, nulla di più, in quanto sta a te associare una figura divina a ciò che accade attorno e dentro di noi. <br>  <br>  Ciao...!|`|BX2zuRPZaa	per me se Dio esiste è lui la causa del male. nella sua mente perfetta,come ha fatto a non prevedere il tradimento di Lucifero?

Il male non è una realtà sostanziale(non è un oggetto o un qualcosa), bensì mancanza di bene. Il male nasce quando noi deliberatamente non scegliamo Dio e di conseguenza ciò che scegliamo è nulla, ossia il male. Se potessimo scegliere solo Dio, ossia il Bene, allora non avremmo alcuna libertà. La chiesa insegna che il male non è stato voluto da Dio, ma dall'uomo inseguito al peccato originale. Adamo ed Eva, che simboleggiano l'umanità, scelsero di non seguire Dio, e da qui il male. Il male pertanto è la negazione di Dio.|`|I9fl9gTtaa	Dio è il tutto ciò che vi è sulla Terra!|`|UNT2zs8paa	Ma soprattutto se Dio è tutto, come può non essere anche il male?<br>  <br>  E se lui non è il male, allora esiste una entità unica ancora più superiore?|`|tzvjmknwaa	DIO NON E' ASSOLUTAMENTE IL MALE ...ANZI LUI DESIDERA SOLO LA SALVEZZA DI TUTTI QUANTI.

He's incredibly religious which could be a very bad thing if you don't share his depth of devotion.

It says, "Glossolalia occurred in some of the ancient Greek religions and in various primitive religions." (Just look up "tongues" or "gift of tongues" for the complete reference.)<br>  <br>  My friends at work claim (and the Pentecostal church teaches) that speaking in tongues is "the first initial sign of the filling of the Holy Spirit." I tell them that I am filled with the Holy Spirit just as they are but I have never spoken in tongues. I tried to think of someone who I felt was the most filled with the Holy Spirit that I can imagine and the reverend Billy Graham came to my mind.  I thought, "Now if there was ever a man filled with the Holy Spirit, this is the guy! I mean he has completely devoted his life to the Lord and has for decades held crusades all over the world where thousands have received Jesus Christ into their hearts.  Surely, if speaking in tongues is "the first initial sign of the filling of the Holy Spirit" as my Pentecostal friends claim,  then Mr. Graham would have experienced it, right?"  But in his excellent book, "The Holy Spirit" he reveals that he has never spoken in tongues.  And after praying about it and doing some research on the subject here is my own personal conclusion:<br>  <br>  The gift of tongues is often counterfeit brought about by peer pressure. Even my Pentecostal friends admit this. But there is also the genuine gift which is real. People who speak in tongues seem to think that everyone filled with the Holy Spirit does so and this is where the confusion lies.  I disagree with them and in 1 Corinthians 12:28-31 Paul clearly points out that not all will possess the gift of tongues. It says, <br>  "28 And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.<br>  <br>  29 Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?<br>  <br>  30 Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?<br>  <br>  31 But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way." (KJV)<br>  <br>  The gift of tongues is simply given to people who need a sign. This is clearly illustrated in the New Testament when the disciple, Thomas, doubted that Jesus had risen from the dead. Jesus offered Thomas his nail peirced hands to touch as a 'sign' to help his unbelief. To those of us who are fully convinced of the reality of Jesus and His saving work, no 'sign' is needed. Why offer a jury more evidence if they've already accepted the truth? So, contrary to the popular belief of many of our friends who speak in tongues, speaking in tongues doesn't mean you are more spiritual (the Corinthian church spoke in tongues and they were the most corrupt church in the New Testament!).  If anything, it means your lack of faith needed an extra boost and God was gracious enough to give it to you.  This is why we read in 1 Corinthians 14:22,"...tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not..." (KJV).<br>  <br>  Now, doesn't that make the most sense?<br>  <br>  The answerer above screen named "me" is correct. Biblically, for tongues to be genuine, it must be interpreted for the benefit of the hearers in the church.  But in today's Pentecostal churches, there is rarely an interpretation by anyone.  In fact, I know of one instance where a Hebrew student went to a Pentecostal service, stood up and recited the Lord's Prayer in Hebrew (just to see if it would be "interpreted") and an "interpreter" stood up and "interpreted" it as being a warning from God about drug use among the young church members!<br>  <br>  So, if you're going to buy into all this speaking in tongues stuff..."buyer beware!"|`|d26c3f0ac69f989a0f0475dde9f48bd9aa	If you understand what a tongue is, then you will know that it is only another language that you have not learned. Our native tongue here in the US is English. If a Spaniard walks up to you and starts speaking Spanish to you, you will not understand him unless you have learned Spanish also. That's all it is, nothing else.|`|AA11586837	You don't know when GOD is agonna use you to deliver a message in a meeting Till HE does!<br>  But, you can choose to speak (pray) in Tongues anytime, or anywhere you want to.<br>  You can access GOD doing this and get Answers to problems.<br>  A commanding officer in Vietnam (American) found out how to get his men out of a trap by praying in Tongues.<br>  The Star that led the Wise Men rose up in the EAST.<br>  The guy on the other end of the Radio (in the trap) knew what direction for his men to run in when the Americans started shelling the Enemy.<br>  Everybody got out alive.  The transmission (radio) didn't mention EAST because the Enemy was listening in and the Americans knew it.<br>  The American commander only said to Run in the Direction of the Star of Bethleham when we start shelling.<br>  <br>  GOD is Good.  GOD  (wisdom, knowledge and understanding) can be accessed by Praying in Tongues.<br>  Ditto................|`|4c979acd3ee945a6e63181337a60c6e7aa	I've personally been around alot of Christians who babble on during worship & use it to put the focus on themselves. It should be a real and intelligible language (1 Corinthians 14:10), it should be for the purpose of communicating God's Word with a person of another language (Acts 2:6-12) and if you speak in tongues, someone must interpret, if there is no interpreter, the speaker should keep quiet and speak to God alone (1 Corinthians 14:27-28).

JZRRXad4aa	I agree with you on the low probability that there is anything 'perfect'.  <br>  <br>  What is perfection anyway?  What is perfect to one is not to another.  Also one must have something to measure against.<br>  <br>  Most do not realize that no one has EVER been able to precisely (perfectly) measure 12 inches/or a foot, nor have they ever been able to draw a 'perfect circle'.  Yes, in (number) theory they exist--in our reality--not. <br>  <br>  Therefore, a 'perfect place' like heaven would not really be possible; as what is 'heaven' to one may be 'hell' to another--so why would God even attempt to create such a place?<br>  <br>  Another misunderstanding is that there is an 'ultimate anything'.  If that were true, then all eternity would come to a grinding halt.<br>  <br>  Is there a heaven?  Of course, and you, I and everyone else will experience it just as soon as we get off our dead asses and create it!?  And we have a choice--we can either chose to create 'heaven' or create 'a hell'!?|`|Ub8wrlcTaa	Maybe in the same way there is a proof that Santa Claus exists with an explanation on how, for a fat man, he can fly around the world delivering presents to all the good little boys and girls in just one night.|`|Vfp3SVBuaa	With man it is impossible but with God all things are possible.|`|dc3ff79f8582370b01bf97e5c51d3980aa	"Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."

AA12254559	If you are this worried about it, there has to be something to it. If he is willing to tell you he has this feelings, that's a good thing. He's being honest. But sometimes honesty can hurt. If I were you, I would ask him if he is more attracted to girls or guys. It could be that he's attracted to both. In that case, you have to ask yourself if you are willing to accept that about him. It's more of a personal thing, and the fact that he told you means that he trusts you enough to let you into all of his life. Maybe his telling you is a way for him to be ok if it doesn't work out with you. <br>  <br>  It is possible that since he was abused by this person when he was younger (yes, that was abuse!!!!) that his mind made up a way for it to be ok. He may need to talk to someone about the feelings he is having, and about what happened when he was younger. That could help him sort stuff out in his mind, and will help him to decide what he really wants. I would suggest it to him in a non-threatening way. Just casually ask him if he has seen a counselor, or psychologist about it. If not, it may be good to push him in that direction. <br>  <br>  If you decide that you can't handle it, let him know. There is nothing wrong with admitting your feelings, and in the long run, will help both of you. Good luck!!|`|AA10961241	It's possible he might be bisexual.|`|AA11964218	ok...this guy I used to be friends with told me when he was 8 this older guy did the same thing with him...he wasnt raped or anything...the other guy was like 5 yrs older...but anyway...Ive thought he was gay since I met him in 1999...I really think he is bisexual but is too proud or scared to admit it...that could be the case with your boyfriend...give it some time...asking him will only make the both of you uncomfortable...wait it out a bit...|`|b89e65189032e6d292d3aa2e862d09a9aa	he is a bi.

If it's the best sex he ever had, then your question has been answered.|`|iwyKaRpRaa	It sounds to me that he is testing your reaction towards his comments.  That says that there is a chance he is gay, however he might just be trying to figure out for himself if he is gay too.  He might just be playing mind games too but it sounds to me that he is at least expressing the idea to help him feel open about some desires or thought he has been having.  Ask him straight up if he is gay?  Does he like men?  How does he feel about woman?  Just ask him to be brutally honest and then you will know where he is at?  Than you know!|`|pX9Kd7dBaa	he could be bisexual|`|nRIsTdfIaa	I can see how you would feel unsure about him. He has basically told you that he's bisexual. He likes women (like you), but he's also ok with men (like if he went to jail).<br>  <br>  Women are more sensitive to minutae- minute details that may or may not register conciously. Woman's intuition is very real. Our subconcious mind sometimes puts 2 and 2 together and gets 4, even when we aren't actually aware anyone was talking about numbers!<br>  <br>  Trust your gut on this. I really think he's bisexual... He may not realize it, but he is, and your "wierd feeling"... that was your own woman's intuition.
Ub8wrlcTaa	Ok.. whether or not the asker was taking this seriously or not, I don't know, but I thought it was pretty funny and checked out the Web site he mentioned.<br>  <br>  I put in my own name and bingo, the first verse that pops up is this one:<br>  <br>  Genesis 3:5 "for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil."  <br>  <br>  The first set of results include the next two verses as well.<br>  <br>  Now, I'm an atheist who is interested in advocating atheism.  Part of that includes a study into the origins of the idea of God.  Above any other verse in the bible, Genesis 3:5 has been the single verse I have been most focused on, as I think the story of Adam and Eve is really about the origins of God and religion rather than the origins of man.  <br>  <br>  Here's my take on it:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AnmdV0RnPI70LrdCy2X.jELsy6IX?qid=20070423151857AAYpYDM">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  If this is a coincidence, it is an absolutely huge one.

Most importantly why are men cheered on for such behaviour?

L8h9EHkeaa	In my opinion, the most important thing you need to keep in mind is that alcoholism is a disease.  I understand that you are hurt that you have caught him in little lies and sneaking drinks but, as you know, it isn't him - it's the disease.  <br>  <br>  I think the best thing you can do to help him overcome this disease is to be there for him and, most importantly, be supportive and understanding.  To try your best not to judge him or look down upon him.  Not to force him into getting help but to be with him through every step of recovery.  Force only causes resistance.  I do not think that giving ultimatums is contrsuctive or helpful in the situation.<br>  <br>  I understand your decision not to marry him because of this situation and think it is a smart one.  However, if the only reason you want to work on your relationship is for the child's sake, you may want to reconsider.  Does he exhibit any behavior when drinking that is harmful to you or could be harmful to your child?  Do you want someone who is intoxicated taking care of your child?  I am not saying he is a bad person or that he should not be around children, I am merely stating that if he is intoxicated, his judgment is impaired and could be detrimental. <br>  <br>  Best of luck.  With as much thought and consideration you are giving this, I'm sure you will do whatever is best for your family.  Please do remember to be understanding and supportive.  That is the best advice I can provide.|`|1ehmRBruaa	An alcoholic is not going to stop drinking because you laid down rules. He will stop because he wants to. We can't make men change not matter how much we want to think we can.<br>  I would take Gandalf's Ghost advice take my baby and run like hell.|`|S4XUl7qWaa	The first thing I would do is find yourself a spouse/family support group for alcoholics and/or addicts. You will be able to tap into resources there, and get advice from other people who have relationships with addicts. It is your choice to remain in the relationship, and it is his choice whether he stays in recover or not, in the end, but attending such meetings yourself will help to gain perspective on his (and possibly your own) patterns of behavior which contribute to the addiction.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	So he's willing to put alcohol over you.<br>  <br>  No amount of ultimatums will "cure" his problem.

It has as a primary concept that the alcoholic is irredeemably damaged and permanently ill -- it convinces the person that control has been completely and forever lost, and that one drink will be all it takes to send them back into the pit.  AA essentially teaches that alcoholics are weak-willed who can never fully regain their will (the reliance on an outside intervention, even if just 'Good Orderly Direction') and that alcohol has permanent control over them.<br>  <br>  The most successful programs focus on helping the person detox from the chemical effects and then re-establishing the person's control, breaking the control that the alcohol has come to represent by building healthy self-esteem, responsible consumption, and the person's strength of will.|`|6DQSkKgWaa	I think you are very wise to make those rules.  <br>  <br>  If I were in your situation, I would talk to an Al Anon counselor and ask their advice about it.  <br>  <br>  My brother was a counselor for Narcotics Anonymous and he said the success rate is very low, but if someone is truly motivated and has the backup support of his friends and family, it can be done.<br>  <br>  You should also not keep any alcohol in the house and not be around people who drink if at all possible.

AA suggests 90 meetings in 90 days. Alcoholism can never be cured but people can live the rest of their lives without alcohol. I see it all the time. <br>  The only trick is to give yourself to the program absolutely. Get a sponsor, go to meetings, call someone in the fellowship if you have a craving. DO THE STEPS In the order that they were written. <br>  AA has saved millions of lives. And it ranges from the poor "bum" on the street to company executives and to every phase of society.<br>  If he has you and the baby as motivation he has a chance but he must never let his guard down.And you can join Al anon that are a group of people who live with alcoholics.

They will understand because they've been through it too.<br>  Also, about him and AA if he thinks he's got a unique problem that AA can't possibly solve  he must remember that we all thought that too.Just get him to commit to the meetings. He will originally do it for you and the baby but he'll end up doing it for himself. And that, believe it or not is where you want him.<br>  God bless and help you through this.|`|lR6Ocjm1aa	Breaking the Chains of<br>  Alcohol Abuse<br>  <br>  “My father was an alcoholic, and I followed in his footsteps. At 12 years of age, I was already drinking. By the time I married, I was getting drunk every day. I became violent; often the police came to my family’s aid. My health deteriorated. Alcohol caused a gastric hemorrhage, which I barely survived. I then developed cirrhosis and anemia. I joined self-help groups in an attempt to quit, but to no avail.

Most of our problems are rooted in our childhood, and 'regressing' as far back as this, is good enough for me to help people with their problems should they have any. Our reality is in the 'now'.

Q8KXxzV0aa	“The law of his God is in his heart; his steps do not slip.” Steps directed from a heart inscribed with Jehovah’s law are carefully, surely and firmly placed on solid footing and there will be no slipping or backsliding, no falling from the path of integrity. This world reeks with sin because it has God’s word only in a book, not in its heart: “I have laid up thy word in my heart, that I might not sin against thee.” (Ps. 37:31; 119:11, RS) So a heart filled with Jehovah’s law is a safeguard against sinning and backsliding. This world stresses mental brilliance, but Jehovah looks on the heart. What good is the world’s wisdom when out of a wicked heart it is moved to misuse it and make it foolish in Jehovah’s sight? Is it not better to have an average mind directed into right uses by a good heart than to have a brilliant one misdirected into harmful channels by an evil heart?<br>  <br>  The word “apostasy” comes from a Greek term that means “a standing away from,” “a falling away, defection,” “rebellion, abandonment.” The first one to fall away from the true worship of Jehovah was Satan the Devil. He was therefore the first apostate. (John 8:44) He caused the first human couple to become apostates. <br>  <br>  Jesus himself explained what was behind this falling away from true worship. He said that he had sowed good seeds but that the enemy, Satan, would oversow the field with weeds. So along with the first blades of wheat, the weeds appeared also. Thus, a deviation from pure Christianity was to be expected until the harvest, when Christ would set?matters?right. (Matthew 13:24-43) The Encyclopedia Americana comments: “Fourth century Trinitarianism did not reflect accurately early Christian teaching regarding the nature of God; it was, on the contrary, a deviation from this teaching.” - 1?Timothy 1:6.<br>  <br>  They would “publicly declare they know God,” but in reality they would “disown him by their works.” (Titus 1:16) The apostle Peter likewise warned that false teachers would “quietly bring in destructive sects and [would] disown even the owner that bought them.” Their bad conduct, he said, would cause people to speak “abusively” about “the way of the truth.” (2?Peter 2:1,?2) To disown Christ in this way, says Greek scholar W.?E.?Vine, means to “deny the Father and the Son, by apostatizing and by disseminating pernicious teachings.”<br>  <br>  <br>  ADDED:<br>  <br>  These, then, who cause division and seek to make turmoil for God’s people are in a very perilous position before Jehovah. None of such should ever overlook Paul’s warning words at Hebrews 6:4-8, where it is shown that those who deliberately sin against God’s holy spirit can never be ‘revived again to repentance.’ <br>  <br>  So those who turn to apostasy would never be forgiven.  Of course, only Jehovah God and Christ Jesus can determine if a person has reached the point where it is impossible for him to be revived again to repentance.<br>  <br>  Christians, then, ‘have need of endurance, in order that, after they have done the will of God, they may receive the fulfillment of the promise.’ So let us earnestly endeavor to be faithful in our service to God—“not the sort that shrink back to destruction, but the sort that have faith to the preserving alive of the soul.”—Heb. 10:36, 39.|`|AA11849917	That same passage in Hebrews further explains that it is the one who has tasted the power of God, and seen His glory, and partaken of His grace, etc, etc (depending on which translation you use), for THAT person (just as it's also true in satan's case who was in the very presence of God and actually saw God), if you turn your back on God after all that, there is no more forgiveness.<br>  <br>  Backsliding is the action in which you sort of let your faith slip away due to neglect, and a good revival or sermon could bring you back.  <br>  <br>  Falling away, on the other hand, is deliberately turning your back on God and rejecting all His Grace and Love and Mercy.<br>  <br>  I trust that this helps clarify things somewhat.<br>  <br>  Additional comment:<br>  For those who think backsliding is not biblical, God continuously cried out to backsliding Israel through the Old Testament prophets, to return to Him and quit her backsliding!

Here are expressed the deep, inner longings and desire of his heart to woo them and win them back by His love. "I will heal their backsliding," He promises; "I will love them freely..." (Hos 14:4)<br>       The word "backslide" literally means "turn back" or "turn away" (from God, 1 Ki 11:9; from our first love, Rev 2:4; or from the gospel, Gal 1:6, 7; 3:1-5; to Satan, 1 Tim 5:15; to evil, Psa 125:5; or to the world, 2 Tim 4:10). Scripture metaphorically describes the backslidden state as: serving two masters, forsaking the Lord, going our own way, leaving our first love, forgetting God, falling away, turning aside ("like a deceitful bow," Jer 14:7), growing cold, departing from the faith, putting a hand to the plow and looking back (Lk 9:62), "salt that has lost its savour" (Mat 5:13), "a dog returning to his vomit" (Prov 26:11), a dead branch (Jn 15:6; Heb 6:8).<br>       With the abundance of Bibles in America, a church in every neighborhood; and bookstores, tape ministries, and nationwide religious television and radio, why do they backslide? How do they fall?<br>       The backslider does not suddenly wake up one morning and go out and commit adultery. Over a period of time, he may have become lax in his thought life, or entertained fleshly desires.

If the child were to leave your home and go out into the world and lose touch with you, then one day call you and ask for you to forgive him/her, and ask if he/she could come back home, would you forgive them and bring them home?<br>  So, with that in mind, "christians" who say you cannot be saved after turning away, just don't get the message from Jesus.  I might even be bold enough to ask you to go get a copy of the "Jefferson Bible", a bible that Thomas Jefferson compiled from ONLY the sayings of Jesus, not any other source, and then read the Jefferson Bible and what Jesus really said, and what his message really was.  Not how man intreprets it, nor how religion interprets it.<br>  good question, thanks for asking it.|`|KSknqYoqaa	what kind of christian you are talking about? for sure when jesus ransom everybody we should repent with our sins sincerely, which mean we shouldn't do an intentional sin like if we are challenging god's power and sovereignty like the devil did. we cannot repeat sin over and over again thinking jesus gave his life for me so i can sin freely, this is completely absurd and  wrong. repentance unless is whole heart and sincere won't be forgiven if you are aware of your sin and you know it's wrong it is only god who can answer you since he can read heart and mind and the future. never forget judas iscariot, he sinned intentionally so god can't forgive him since he knows what he did is unpardonable to him but he continue sinning, and he let his greediness drive his desires, besides he was aware of his acts,.|`|QusenkISaa	"Backsliding" is not a biblical doctrine.

In his case, he has seen the face of Jesus firsthand and the grace of God. However he chose to rebel against what was holy and right. Therefore since he was allready in the presence of Him, he cannot be welcomed back. He took the name and holiness of God in vain. When we backslide, we stray, and is why God calls us sheep. You know in your heart if you love Him and need Him in your life. when you feel that conviction there is till hope. when God calls you back home, just come. Just come. Don't worry about anything else. Just come. Those who fall way deny him and say that His death on the cross was in vain, therefore crucifying Jesus afresh or anew. Those cannot return.

The veracity of the Bible has been assailed from many quarters, but none of these efforts has undermined or weakened its position in the least.<br>  <br>  Bible history. Sir Isaac Newton once said: “I find more sure marks of authenticity in the Bible than in any profane history whatsoever.” (Two Apologies, by R.?Watson, London, 1820, p.?57) Its integrity to truth proves sound on any point that might be tested. Its history is accurate and can be relied upon. For example, what it says about the fall of Babylon to the Medes and Persians cannot be successfully contradicted (Jer 51:11, 12,?28; Da 5:28), neither can what it says about people like Babylonian Nebuchadnezzar (Jer 27:20; Da 1:1); Egyptian King Shishak (1Ki 14:25; 2Ch 12:2); Assyrians Tiglath-pileser III and Sennacherib (2Ki 15:29; 16:7; 18:13); the Roman emperors Augustus, Tiberius, and Claudius (Lu 2:1; 3:1; Ac 18:2); Romans such as Pilate, Felix, and Festus (Ac 4:27; 23:26; 24:27); nor what it says about the temple of Artemis at Ephesus and the Areopagus at Athens (Ac 19:35; 17:19-34). What the Bible says about these or any other places, people, or events is historically accurate in every detail.—Races and languages. What the Bible says about races and languages of mankind is also true. All peoples, regardless of stature, culture, color, or language, are members of one human family. The threefold division of the human family into the Japhetic, Hamitic, and Semitic races, all descending from Adam through Noah, cannot be successfully disputed. (Ge 9:18,?19; Ac 17:26) Says Sir Henry Rawlinson: “If we were to be guided by the mere intersection of linguistic paths, and independently of all reference to the Scriptural record, we should still be led to fix on the plains of Shinar, as the focus from which the various lines had radiated.”—The Historical Evidences of the Truth of the Scripture Records, by G.?Rawlinson, 1862, p. 287; Ge 11:2-9.For hundreds of years handwritten copies of the Scriptures continued to be made, during which period the Bible was expanded with the addition of the Christian Greek Scriptures. Translations or versions of these Holy Writings also appeared in other languages. Indeed, the Hebrew Scriptures are honored as the first book of note to be translated into another language. Extant today are thousands of these Bible manuscripts and versions.The first printed Bible, the Gutenberg Bible, came off the press in 1456. Today distribution of the Bible (the whole or in part) has reached over two billion copies in upwards of 1,800 languages. But this has not been accomplished without great opposition from many quarters. Indeed, the Bible has had more enemies than any other book; popes and councils even prohibited the reading of the Bible under penalty of excommunication. Thousands of Bible lovers lost their lives, and thousands of copies of the Bible were committed to the flames. One of the victims in the Bible’s fight to live was translator William Tyndale, who once declared in a discussion with a cleric: “If God spare my life ere many years, I will cause a boy that driveth the plough shall know more of the Scripture than thou doest.”—Actes and Monuments, by John Foxe, London, 1563, p. 514.Manuscripts of Hebrew Scriptures. There are possibly 6,000 manuscripts of all or portions of the Hebrew Scriptures extant today in various libraries. The vast majority contain the Masoretic text and are of the tenth century C.E. or thereafter. The Masoretes (of the second half of the first millennium C.E.) sought to transmit the Hebrew text faithfully and made no changes in the wording of the text itself. However, to preserve the traditional pronunciation of the vowelless consonantal text, they devised systems of vowel pointing and accenting. Additionally, in their Masora, or marginal notes, they drew attention to textual peculiarities and gave corrected readings they considered necessary. It is the Masoretic text that appears in printed Hebrew Bibles of the present dayManuscripts of Christian Greek Scriptures. The Christian Scriptures were written in Koine. Though no original autograph manuscripts thereof are known to exist today, according to one calculation, there are some 5,000 extant manuscript copies, whole or in part, of these Scriptures in Greek.Extant Hebrew manuscripts of the Scriptures were prepared with great care. Respecting the text of the Hebrew Scriptures, scholar W.?H. Green observed: “It may be safely said that no other work of antiquity has been so accurately transmitted.” (Archaeology and Bible History, by J.?P. Free, 1964, p. 5) The late Bible text scholar Sir Frederic Kenyon made this reassuring statement in the introduction to his seven volumes entitled The Chester Beatty Biblical Papyri: “The first and most important conclusion derived from the examination of them [the Papyri] is the satisfactory one that they confirm the essential soundness of the existing texts. No striking or fundamental variation is shown either in the|`|nURoPCPzaa	There is no original form.  We all know that the Bible was originally an oral history, eventually being written down after centuries of being told from generation to generation.  Scholars point out that as the Jewish people moved from place to place, the Old Testament was altered to reflect the change they were experiencing.  <br>  The New Testament was culled from many sources; there were many gospels and letters originally being passed around before the version we use today was culled together.<br>  There's nothing wrong with this process necessarily as long as we don't take everything in the Bible literally and realize it comes down to us from a time when standards of record keeping weren't as rigorous.  It's an ancient text that is filled with some accurate history, some mythology, and some practical advice for living a life in tune with God, as well as mysteries that don't make sense.

But they deliberately forget that long ago by God's word the heavens existed and the earth was formed out of water and by water. By these waters also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed. By the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.But do not forget this one thing, dear friends: With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day.

Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)<br>  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)<br>  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)<br>  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)<br>  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)<br>  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21<br>  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)<br>  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.<br>  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a>|`|Xg1ZR4ptaa	He comes when he comes.|`|yHfsHp6naa	He's on antidepressants.|`|ttTDiJWfaa	Michael L be a man and don't insult her.

DNA is a 'molecule with a pattern' that can be considered to have a code in as much as something classified as 'information' can be deduced from it. But, it is the nature of that information that we need to consider. When you drop vinegar into bicarb, (baking soda) the result is predictable because of the reaction of the substances. But is the 'information' inside either chemical to react in that way?, is there a code?. <br>  <br>  It is the concept of a code that is created by a consious mind, the rest really is nature and pure accident of chance and and probability over time.<br>  <br>  We create 'codes' in the same way we create gods and fairies, they serve a very human purpose and are more to do with our creativity and natural selection.<br>  <br>  DNA may yet be fully designed by a mind or entity...us.|`|AA11120822	2 on your list is an assertion made with no logical or evidential support.

(a belief which has persisted among some descendants of caucasian europeans for over 700 years!)<br>  <br>  Is it just when it's believed by someone else?<br>  <br>  Or is it, when it's /your/ belief?<br>  <br>  At what point, what consideration, what element of a belief makes it a social stigma to ridicule it?<br>  <br>  When does something cease to be a crazy notion, and become just a different belief?<br>  <br>  There is no answer, all beliefs are, and should be, open to ridicule.|`|bJnqYE6maa	No, I think looking down on the taxpayers and mortgaging the future of their country while lying to their faces about the reasons for it - that is the lowest of the low<br>  <br>  One step below child molesting.|`|7K2HVodhaa	No. Why would it be?|`|cYsPx9sSaa	yes|`|bloGqdBqaa	only if it's islam.. then the pseudo liberals come out with their racism crap and "what about christianity?" bollox.<br>  <br>  every other religion is fair game.|`|tqA9kxeqaa	oooh, good question.<br>  i certainly think so!|`|771e401b864ef2c6278719b487b80406aa	Any insult, if it is simply an insult, is rather low, and not helpful.|`|z4Yeofq8aa	Not if I allow them the opportunity to insult me back.

The Jews, Stalin's purges, Jihadists under the bed - You name it, an ethnic minority has been painted as big fat target for the masses to hate.<br>  <br>  Ps. Also a gay atheist. Hiiiiiiiiiiiii!!!!!!|`|AA11707311	I have never asked a question about homosexuality, even though this board is filled with questions from Non-Christians trying to lay some guilt trip on Christians about Homosexuality.<br>  I do not feel the guilt of doing anything more than explaining that it clearly is a sin, and not a virtue.<br>  If you cannot understand this, or refuse to acknowledge the spiritual darkness of homosexuality, you should go and play with a "chicken hawker" who will explain to you (and show you) just how 'virtuous' it is.|`|AA11476749	I don't fixate on the subject. <br>  <br>  But, if you were to look at the questions lately here at Y!A, you would see the vast majority of them are asked by non-Christians.  <br>  <br>  Personally, I don't find homosexuality any more offensive than adultery.  Both are sexual sins.  <br>  <br>  Jesus came to deliver us from our sins.  My sins may be different than yours, but without Christ, both of us are doomed.  <br>  <br>  People are incredulous that we actually believe in something that, for them, is archaic, and not at all "politically-correct."<br>  |`|f3531b6f54158276ac57573d3f499ebdaa	In Biblical (and Medieval) times, the seat of power was the phallus, so if you lay with a man as with a woman, you strip that man of status. So basically, they're afraid of losing the only thing they can cling to when their crops are blighted or when their liege sends them on another Crusade. They can still turn around and say "at least I'm not a woman."|`|TBjIJnWvaa	Probably because they have a personal disgust with homosexuality... Christian values are nice and convienient to justify their hate.|`|c0oiqgc1aa	They have nothing else to pick on, so they pick on the easy target.<br>  <br>  I am 100% against banning gay marriage by the way. I strongly believe in free choice. They should mind their own business and leave gay people alone.|`|ruBzT6v9aa	And why are homosexuals fixated with marriage? |`|5JQFCQCkaa	Because it's in the Torah, and as such, they have to follow it.|`|27d6fd19ae9c4fc896c24ed094c8929faa	The media would have you believe christians fixate on homosexuality. When the subject is brought up it's one thing. But most of the time I don't think about it, believe it or not it's not in the big 7. There's nothing wrong with deeply loving someone of the same sex. It's when it culminates into an unnatural act that it becomes sin. Most of the christians I talk to (that are real in their committment) fixate more on living right themselves, than judging others. Your sin or lack of it doesn't define who you are or your worthiness. God's grace is all that can save any of us.<br>  <br>  Btw adultery is illegal in most states as is premarital sex unless you're of consenting age & both consent. Some greed is illegal once manifested in actions involving others. Gluttony is still legal but with all the hubbub about obesity I figure like cigarettes they'll figure a way to regulate it.|`|FQluz9dcaa	Well c'mon...they have to hate SOMETHING.<br>  <br>  It has always been true that any society has to have some sort of outlet for their hate.  First it was women, then it was jews, then it was blacks, and now it's gays.  <br>  <br>  There are MANY more examples of this hate.  It's all about wanting to feel superior to someone else because it gives them a sense of security.  They furthermore embrace this hatred because they find verses in a book written by men a long time ago which say it's okay.  It's also funny how they ignore the other verses which say "stone your children if they disobey you" or "women are to always be subject to men."<br>  <br>  Cherry-picking, my dear, it's called Cherry-picking.|`|mvVhbY1Gaa	Christians don't fixate on homosexuality. Homosexuality has become more active in infiltrating our society and as it has become more active so have those standing up in opposition to it. If you try to ram something down societies throat like they are your going to get people opposing you. The sooner you get seperation of Church and state out of your head the better off you'll be. Seperation of Church and state is myth.|`|hm6RooB2aa	Reading some of these comments make me sick, I never knew how many extremist religious people there are. The religious notion is honestly one that needs to go, giving people divine reasoning for everything they do , be it right or wrong, because you convince them they can talk to a "god"? I'm all for freedom of thought and speech, but mind your own damned business and focus less on someones sexual preference and maybe get a hobby.|`|AA11076273	Perhaps, deep down, they are frightened that they might be gay<br>  <br>  People are arfraid of someone or something that is different or that they don't understand. It has always been this way. Some seek to explain  this by creating myths to explain it and inn this manner, religions are born. Thus, christians have a propensity for this fear of difference that doesn't fit their mythology|`|uBFZwkx1aa	That's a good question. I also find it extremely maddening that our country preaches "separation of church n state", yet gay marriages are a topic. wtf?  Who gives anyone the right to say who can marry who? Look at the heterosexual divorce rate...50% - probably higher now. I think they fixate on it because they choose not to understand it. I feel like most "Christians" enjoy living a blissfully ignorant & hypocritical life....not to mention they choose to live their life based on a book that was written how many years ago...? C'mon...<br>  <br>  I agree that there are things exceedingly more important to worry about. |`|8UtYmKfMaa	Murder, rape etc. are all generally considered atrocities by the public. The homosexual agenda however is trying to make it seem like it is something that is okay and natural. <br>  <br>  As soon as large groups of people try and make rape (and all the other things you listed) out to be something good, we'll start addressing it more strongly.<br>  <br>   |`|ZvFcCSk2aa	I don't think we fixate on Homosexuality, maybe you do, and thats all that you see cause your gay. But I can tell you that homosexuality is in direct rebelion to your creator, and your creator God who is the Father of Jesus, came to earth and destroyed several entire cities for commiting homosexuality and other sins, so good luck is all I can say...|`|KeDuKdgCaa	I've been wondering that myself...<br>  <br>  In the politics section (where I spend most of my time) you can now see all these new users (trolls) with screen names like "Prop 8 Rocks" and "No Gay Marriage" and all they do is answer questions about Gay people with antagonistic remarks.<br>  <br>  Why the fixation, Christians?<br>  <br>  I guess there's no Commandment that says "Thou shalt mind one's own business"...|`|FsByX9xxaa	heh, mostly cause they are a bunch of homophobes who cant handle it when they are gay.

If they fixate on murder, etc., then they are no better than everyone else, since everyone is against that.|`|AA11928155	The bible says homosexuality is  a sin. However it also says that lying is a sin. Sin God does not see any sin as worse than any other then it is not for anyone of this earth to judge you. Since we all have sinned. Even though I can't say for sure I am kind of under the impression that when the Bible speaks of homosexuality he is speaking of the roman orgies and the men taking young boys away and using them as sex slaves. This was totally different. But I am not certain. I'm not scholar.|`|LEug4ECaaa	actually christians <br>  "fixate" on SIN. not just homosexuality. <br>  <br>  those that are Gay fixate themselves on being Gay, and reject the councel of religious leaders. and Usually end up being self named atheists. <br>  <br>  but it is just as Wrong to commit fornication as it is to commit sodomy. <br>  and i have fixated All my life on the commandment of fornication. because i argued with God in my prayers over this commandment. <br>  <br>  Guess who won that argument?!!|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	The real question should be, "Why so homosexuals fixate on homosexuality?"<br>  <br>  Most people I know couldn't care less what type of despicable acts you do in private.<br>  <br>  Just keep them to yourselves, and quit trying to make the rest of the world accept them as normal ... because they're not.|`|TOBYij3Qaa	I think because it is a sin that people refuse to repent of<br>  all sin is punishable by death, and we are all sinners<br>  but we are told to repent and believe<br>  <br>  a refusal to repent and submit to God over any sin shows outright defiance, but I dont know why there is anger instead of brokenness for them, it is a sin not to love<br>  I

I would have much preferred for her to celebrate the birthday when drinking alcohol was legal here at home. Despite strict codes of conduct, a Sargent is no replacement for a mom and dad. In general, I prefer 18 as the legal age for alcohol consumption, because it is more likely that these young people will be still living at home with their parents, rather than living away from home.<br>  <br>  I don't think most states, nor the federal government, will make the change.|`|ac825b3aff0d9322a9befa72bcf651f6aa	Depends on how sensible the US teenager is.  <br>  Works in most European country,with the exception of binge-drinking Brits.

K4GxYdoEaa	I get your point, and I respect it, and I know that it is true. There is a lot of people that make jokes about what other ones may consider very important.<br>  However, you have to admit, that non-believers get a lot of insults and offensive comments from believers. I'm not making an excuse, I'm just telling the truth. <br>  There are a lot of believers that say things like, "You don't have a soul", "You don't know what love is", "You live in misery and pain", "You will burn in hell", "You don't deserve living in God's creation". And, those things hurt. And I'm sure that they hurt exactly the same as those stupid comments about believers that you are talking about.<br>  So, why don't we make a deal and try to be nice? I mean, without fanaticism (from both sides).<br>  <br>  Good luck and good point.<br>  <br>  Amy|`|73hsvCU0aa	I think that 'nonbelievers' often get fed up with ridiculous comments from 'believers' and end up saying things for shock value.

You do have to keep in mind though that a big part of the reason that this occurs is because of the polemics against non-believers by the religious community throughout history.<br>  <br>  It goes back several centuries to times when Christian law would have put someone to death for declaring themself an atheist.  There were even laws such as in the state of Tennessee prohibiting atheists from voting or holding office, and who can forget Bush Sr. quipping that atheists should not even be considered American citizens.<br>  <br>  The attitude is pervasive even today with many Christians who will label atheists as immoral beings and bad people who don't want to answer to a higher authority by definition.  Even Christian apologetics sometimes argue this.  Bill Craig has argued this, as has JP Moreland and even Pat Robertson.  <br>  <br>  Chip in the fact that polls have shown that atheists are the most despised group by the religious community, and the last people that would be voted into office- a majority of them would vote for a gay person before an atheist.  <br>  <br>  Look at Liz Dole's recent campaign attack in the North Carolina senate race.  She accused her opponent of being an atheist and therefore unqualified.  She was panned by voters and the media for this- not because it's wrong to bring religious beliefs into a political race just as it would be wrong to bring their race into it, but rather because the accusations were without merit because the woman goes to church and once taught Sunday School.<br>  <br>  Even people I talk to in everyday life that find out I don't believe or no longer believe in God- they immediately want to know what horrible thing happened in my life to cause this, as if they cannot conceive of the plausibility that it was simply an intellectual migration on my part and not some rebellion against God because I was upset.<br>  <br>  In some dictionaries, the word "Godless" has connotations that suggests a person who does immoral deeds.  And you have people always pushing religion upon everyone else and trying to impose their values and worldview on them.<br>  <br>  So hopefully you see that a lot of this stuff you don't like stems from a reaction to the way religious people talk down on or take some moral high ground over non-religious people.  If people would all be willing to respect each others rights to believe or not believe so long as no harm is being caused toward others, there would be no tendentiousness.  There would be no need to clash or butt heads.  And there would be no need on our end to feel like we are always having to defend ourselves.<br>  <br>  As for me, I feel that there is  a fundamental difference between attacking or insulting a belief, and attacking the people who believe personally.  I try not to attack people personally unless attacked first.  It would be nice if this forum could be a place where both sides could learn from each other but it doesn't seem to be that way.|`|l1ctIW7eaa	I also don't believe in bigotry, corruption of our laws by the church, and hate.<br>  <br>  When those that believe in god stop doing things like that, I will leave you completely alone when it comes to your religion.<br>  <br>  If you're not responsible for the above, then I apologize.  But you should be concerned that your fellow 'christians' are spoiling your name.|`|PbrGLvonaa	Don't try stripping us of the freedom of expression. Everyone is free to say something they feel here at Y!A as long as it's not violating the rules. <br>  <br>  I couldn't care less about your whining. We atheists suffered more from you than you from us.<br>  <br>  Anyone can express sad comments about other people's gods. It's free and not illegal. We're not killing anybody for our beliefs. We're not violating any laws about it. Maybe your God's laws but that doesn't count since we atheists couldn't care less. <br>  <br>  We don't spend our whole lives on hating Theism and God. I'm sorry if this saddens you but atheists are free to enter the Religion section of Y!A. Since most of the time God is the topic here, don't be surprised if many atheists here keep on bashing Theist beliefs. Well at least it's still about God. We're not here to keep silent or to praise or venerate some God of theists. This is Yahoo Answers for crying out loud. What's the sense of going in here if we keep silent? There's no way we'll praise or talk positive about God for we don't believe he exists. That's just plain hypocrisy.<br>  <br>  Well I don't insult God. But I find the God concept very contradicting.

Blissfully ignoring one side of it is hardly gonna help your case.<br>  <br>  Also, define what an insult to God is.

I don't think the question should be of respect...but of pity and forgiveness.....remember we must show mercy to others as God has shown to us...we must live and react as He would....with mercy and patience...reacting to Non-Believers with hate is acting no better than they do.|`|TOm0lawCaa	Because when we insult "him," we are really insulting his followers.

The early Christianity had bizarre beliefs about their doctrine as well as their Scriptures. Moreover the Jesus(P) and early Church Fathers were utterly unaware of this doctrine and they never practiced it. Would then the modern day 'true' Christianity brand them as heretics?" (Ibid)<br>  That regardless of which "Trinity" Christians now believe in, it's still condemned.<br>  Here's another spin; that by default of honouring Mary as the Theotokos (Mother of God) we make here a member of the Trinity, instead of the Holy Spirit...<br>  "  The obvious conclusion is that for all practical purpose and in reality, when the issue is of Worshipping, Venerating, Deifying and/or Idolizing, it is Mary - the "Mother of God" and not the Holy Ghost has that kind of rank and status. Briefly, the historical figures of Jesus and Mary are venerated as Deities. The Holy Ghost is not venerated as a Deity."<br>  <a href="http://www.mostmerciful.com/mary.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mostmerciful.com/mary.htm</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Further, God in Christianity is a God of love, BECAUSE he's in a Triune union.

The ONLY reason "ALLAH" and Islam became prominent, was Muhammad showed up one day in Mecca, when there was a religious gathering, and when all the head prophets where inside the arena, he, and his men made there way into the arena, held the prophets at sword-point, and told them if they didn't make him, and Islam "the" religion, they wouldn't be going back to their camels, or their harems.<br>    The Bible is the ONLY prophetic book with a 100% track record, and scientific proof that also validates its truth.

But it is a bit saddening that so many people misunderstand that, and assume it's some kind of moniker attributed to God by Islam. It's also very sad how some other religions use the word Allah to discredit Islam all together (such as quoting bible verses where it says that God has but one name, Yahweh). |`|0banq42Iaa	I think part of the problem is that people see terrorists on the news who say, "I want to kill unbelievers, as Allah commanded." This is not the God we know. Its really hard to know what to believe about Islam because we're hearing conflicting messages. Some people tell us Allah is loving, and others say he wants his followers to kill all unbelievers. |`|BnANLOCEaa	Nearly every nation have a different god. Some calls him buddha, others the sun, some Allah, some god, some Jesus, etc. Islam is the decendants from Abraham, as we the Christians also do.  But the TRUTH is the God of Abraham's Name was YHWH - Yehowah or Yahweh. There is no doubt about it. Why then did you change the Name of our God?|`|pKW7Zf4Taa	It is not true that Mohammed ws the last prophet.

1CS2KR7Taa	Yes I believe in love.<br>  Unfortunately in this world we do not know what true love is.<br>  Although many will not agree with it, even if we think we love someone we do so, because we benefit from the relationship in some respect.<br>  It is not our fault that is how we are built.<br>  Love in spirituality means loving and giving without any self benefit, which we cannot even imagine at present.<br>  But we have the chance to achieve it, all we need is the right method to change our attitude to each other.<br>  Here is a video about our true nature:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW5E0JdQZV4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW5E0JdQZ...</a><br>  And here is a link, that could guide you to such a method of change:<br>  <a href="http://www.kabbalah.info/course/main/?utm_source=Yahoo!%2BAnswers&utm_medium=forum&utm_content=text-link&utm_campaign=semester-winter-2008" rel="nofollow">http://www.kabbalah.info/course/main/?ut...</a><br>  I hope you will find them helpful.|`|hYzfzu9yaa	i believe in the sense that I feel a strong instinct to nurture and protect my husband and children, and would be devastated should anything happen to them.

I always believed that if one wants to assume a philosophical identity it would require pensive consideration and venturing into one's self. A child does not have the mentality to make philosophical decisions and cannot even begin to rationalize death and a metaphysical realm. Such tactics to ensure inhibited thinking must be quite detrimental to a child and their development. The entire philosophical process of identity of ones dogmatic identity is crucial. Circumventing this step only establishes a false sense of conviction and appreciation. Children are much like sheep and easily swayed.

05bddf168eeb3e8ae67ab005844309abaa	The tenet you mean is "The inherent worth and dignity of every person". I do the web sites for two UU churches. Your question reminds me of a funny but true story one of the ministers I work with tells on himself. <br>  <br>  A visitor was talking to him about joining the fellowship; it came out he had lost the faith he'd had as a child, was a recovering alcoholic and had, as the result of a youthful indiscretion, served some time in a conservation camp, which is a minimum security prison. "You'll fit right in", my minister said. "Oh - you ARE a democrat, aren't you?"<br>  <br>  I can only answer for myself. <br>  I would value your worth and dignity. <br>  <br>  Our congregation has a couple of SUV drivers and some disposable diaper types. I don't recycle everything I could, due to the distance; I figure the gas I would burn to take the stuff to the center would harm  the environment more than the recycling would help it.<br>  <br>  There are going to be some people there with whom you don't get along, for many reasons. there will be people with whom you do. That is the nature of a UU congregation. After a while you'll get to appreciate the good points about the people you don't like and see that the ones you do like are not perfect.|`|aPuUuWlLaa	I attended a UU church back when we lived near one although I'm an atheist. I liked the community there and having a group to do community service projects with. They are generally very environmentally conscious. So yeah, you will probably hear about it when you do things that aren't seen as good for the environment. I think they see it as educational though. I would just tell them how it is. Say the car was a gift, its very convenient for you and for now its what you are comfortable with. Tell them you appreciate understand their concern but that you while you are very interested in learning about being a UU you hope that these issues don't mean that you are less welcome but to let you know if they feel that owning an SUV means you can't be UU. I am pretty sure you will get reassurance that they didn't mean it to be so aggressive. I actually saw an article write in from a mom of four in their UU newsletter once saying how she was going to keep driving her SUV while she had four kids with numerous friends and commitments to get them all to so everyone was just going to have to deal with it. It was done said in fun but also to make a point. <br>  <br>  Generally, they are accepting and caring people who are drawn to Unitarian Universalism. They do tend to be passionate about the individual's role in creating positive community, social change, and saving the environment. You will also find a wide range of metaphysical beliefs there from polytheism, monotheism, to none at all. It takes, like with society at large, a willingness to be accepting, diplomatic, and to know when to just maybe drop a topic or agree to disagree. We are such individuals each of us that there probably exists no perfect size hole. What I liked about UUs was the committment to core values rather then the need to all agree on dogma. So essentially, look at those and decide if you feel commitment to those yourself and if its right for you.

yDJiiqcsaa	Yes and no.  It depends on your reasons behind doing it.  Here's the reason.  It is believed that at the Second coming of Christ (the end of the world) our souls will be reunited with our bodies and then our souls/bodies will go either to heaven or to hell. In centuries past some wiseguy thought, "I'll have my body cremated and then the ashes scattered here and there so that even if God wanted to send me (body and soul) to hell He couldn't. (The idea that even God couldn't find or put the body back together).  So that was the beginning of the prohibition against cremation.  However, nowadays if you have your body cremated for economic reasons(to avoid a financial burden on your family) or practical reasons (shipping body back to the U.S. from Thailand where you died on vacation for example) - cremation is considered permissible as long as the reason isn't to defy God. It is also frowned upon to have the ashes scattered (even if it is not meant to defy God) because it is considered disrespectful of the remains of the body (which was the temple of the Holy Spirit during your lifetime). So ..... the answer is : it depends on WHY you want to do it.|`|b660102b2fc9513dd1125d9410450d92aa	The Catholic Church allows cremation now. It was against it, but it is not exactly recommended.

Also Abraham and Sarah tell's how they were put when they died read Genesis 25: 9-10<br>  9) "Then his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, facing Mamre."<br>  10) "the field which Abraham purchased from the sons of Heth; there was Abraham buried with Sarah his wife."<br>  They called it buried, but actually notice it says in a cave is where they laid them.<br>  <br>  Response to hooyutoo....<br>  I have to disagree with your answer to this question.<br>  With God nothing is impossible, so therefore if a person is cremated God can still bring their body back for their spirit.<br>  Think of all the Christians that have died by fire, and back in the dark ages when they tried to stop the Bible from being printed they burned Christians at the stake.<br>  Then there are those that died at sea and their bodies were eaten by fish.<br>  It doesn't matter what happens to our bodies at death, it is our spirit and God will join our bodies back to our spirit.<br>  Hope this helps towards this question.|`|ROfi95d4aa	I know for a long time they wouldn't let you have a funeral mass if you were cremated.

Both man and woman add to the family in special ways that only they can.  Since I don't want children thinking that any other life style is normal I happen to be against gay marriage.  Since it is being forced on school children as young as 6 an 7 when sex should not even be a topic.  You want a life partner then go to an attorney and have him draw up a contract between you and your life partner.

There are also some valid political issues related to limiting marriage to one man and one woman but I won't go into them since you can find them any number of places on the Internet.<br>  <br>  HOWEVER, since you are obviously politically minded, I'm going to try to "sell you" on my perspective on this whole issue. The way I see it, you're trying to align yourself with the wrong side! <br>  <br>  Why exactly do you want to be legally married? How does it benefit you to have your relationship recognized as a "marriage" by the government? I would suggest that EVERY benefit you seek (beyond those offered by pledging your vows in front of witnesses...something you don't need a license to do) is related to a legal benefit of marital status...extending health insurance and other benefits to a spouse, survivor benefits, spousal rights in hospitals and medical decisions, etc... <br>  <br>  In other words, you are accepting that our government sanctions DISCRIMINATION in favor of married people and you want that discrimination extended to you. However, if you would shift your focus, you might find a lot of allies in the community you already belong to...SINGLE people...we're being denied those benefits because we aren't legally married too!!!<br>  <br>  From my perspective, I don't support your fight for gay marriage rights because it would cause you to become part of the group that I already view as my enemy...the people that demand and receive benefits that I can't enjoy unless I marry! The way I see it, there is a non-discriminatory way to solve every problem you're hoping to solve with the right to be legally married...and I would stand with you in fighting to eliminate all forms of government sanctioned discrimination!<br>  <br>  The real solution really is quite simple. Eliminate the concept of legal marriage. Instead, let every adult choose how and with whom they want to share their life. Give every adult the right to designate any other person as their "partner"...not legally, but practically...when they fill out insurance forms, medical cards, wills, etc... Give every adult the rights currently enjoyed only by those that are legally married! Let a single mom designate a live-in nanny/housekeeper as her partner so she can provide benefits...let two single moms team up to raise their kids with one working outside and one working inside the home. Let me designate a friend as my "next of kin" so he or she can visit me in intensive care. <br>  <br>  Whatever you can think of that you'll gain by having the right to be legally married can be gained without asking the government to sanction your personal relationship...and if you could remove that stumbling block, I think you'd find far less resistance to you ideas even from Christians! In short, I don't want the government to sanction your relationship...but I don't want them to sanction ANY relationship...I think it is just plain WRONG for our government to mess around in the homes or the bedrooms of its citizens! Find a way to make the government stop discriminating against ME for my lifestyle choice and I'll be on your side...right now, you're asking me to support your position to give you rights you'll then be in a position to continue denying me! |`|SPNHhFXoaa	Because the bible says it is a sin.

But my answer to prayer was personal, not universal.<br>  <br>  When I die and am judged, I'll be judged for myself and how I've lived up to my promises.  I'm not there to beat anyone out of heaven; I'm not there to see if I made it past the 50% mark and passed, I'm there to be judged personally and individually.  Far too many people act live the judgment will be a reality show where people get voted off and they need to stab others in the back to win.<br>  <br>  For me, I know I'm right, but that doesn't mean that everyone else is wrong because I'm right.<br>  <br>  It's one of our articles of faith states that we believe in worshiping the true and living God and allow all other men to worship how they may.  <br>  <br>  I think it's wrong when people try to mock other religions.  I've studied many religions and find great good in most of them and admire them for their good.  Those who mock often find themselves exposed to their own ignorance.  Take the guy who posted above me.  He quotes Galatians 1:8, but he fails to read on and notice that Paul continues to say that the gospel he preaches is by revelation.  That would make the gospel denying revelation the "other" gospel that should be accursed.  As Paul was converted by a heavenly vision and told us to hold true to his gospel he preached by revelation, I'm not sure how someone thinks that he preaches against revelation and visions.<br>  <br>  Mocking other religions always shows hypocrisy and often does little more than expose the ignorance of the one mocking.|`|kTaa8ejpaa	It is a question of the amount of faith anyone has but rather where they place that faith.<br>  <br>  I believe that a person must be born again in the spirit to be saved...just like Jesus told Nicodemus he must be in (John 3:3).<br>  <br>  I also believe that Romans 10:8-10  gives you what you need to believe to be born again in the spirit.  "You must believe with your heart that God raised Jesus from the dead and you must confess Him with your mouth as Lord and Saviour.  It is with the heart that man believes unto righteousness and it is with the mouth that confession is made unto salvation.<br>  <br>  That is the gospel of Jesus Christ, the one and only thing that can save anyone.  What beliefs, isms, doctrines some practice is immaterial to me.  I cannot be their keeper.  I can tell them the significance of being born again but ultimately they will make up their own minds using their own free will.  <br>  <br>  Of everything that is written in any religious document or text, the above gospel message is all that is necessary for salvation.

He had brown hair & longer than I would expect.  Wavey & thinner at the ends.  He was in a profile.  And he had a pure white robe on.  I was excited when seeing this vision.  And then a thorned crown was pressed in his hair. I at first was surprised, because Perry Stone had commented that Jesus raised from the dead with white hair.  And the vision was clearly brown hair, a profile, & a pure white robe. So this was symbolic of Jesus before He went to the cross.  And the crown was put on Him.  I didn't see blood yet.  It may have been hidden in his hair. (Two visions. One without the crown of thorns. Then one with the crown of thorns mostly hidden in his hair.)<br>  I got really excited about it.  And then the song part of the 'Brush of Angel wings', And an angel or Jesus brushed the side of my face slightly lauphing.<br>  And before this vision was a faint vision of Jesus in the House as the Light in the House.  The messages yesterday is that where ever Jesus went, many followed Him.  He was very popular. 'When Jesus is in the House!"

Yes! The Bible says that Heaven has many things that have  never been seen nor can be imagined  with our mortal minds. Hell on the other hand is incomprehensible. Jesus describes Hell as a place for people who positioned themselves as enemies of God. Some say that Hell runs contrary to a God of Love but God is also a just God. I speculate that Hell is an eternity in a different sense than what we know about. Just maybe, Hell will not be the end. Perhaps it is a place of purification and  eventually all will come to God, but that is only musings in my mind and imagination, wouldn't bet my soul on it.|`|NiDW6SLAaa	Hell is a lake of fire.<br>  Heaven does not exist. Unless you are referring to the "heavens" in the Bible which is just the air/ sky/ atmosphere/ above<br>  <br>  But if you are referring to the place you go when you die that is "Hades" its like a holding place for the dead until the end of time. Hades has two sides one is hot like "hell" and people are thirsty there. The other is Paradise. This is all referred to in the Bible. When Lazarus was resurrected from the dead he mentioned that bad side. When Jesus was on the cross and the robber next to him was saved he said "...you will be with me in Paradise"<br>  <br>  Now what happens after Hades/Paradise? That is explained in the book of Revelation. Revelation refers to a holy city called the "New Jerusalem". This is what many people believe to be "Heaven". They think it has pearly gates and golden streets and mansions.... but it does not. Why? It is because it is NOT a physical place. It is a spiritual place. It is actually the mingling of God and man. The fulfillment of God's purpose for man. God is simply after a Bride for Christ, which is the Church. The Church is not a building. It is the people. The believers in Christ make up the Church. The Church is only a process. It is becoming the New Jerusalem. When it is ready, that is the 2nd coming of Christ and that is heaven brought down to earth.

Heaven is being in the company of God.  Hell is being separated from God.<br>  <br>  A m oron could comprehend that concept.  With a little thought you can see the significance to a believer.

As a nonbeliever, you have only to live a moral upright life, to attain heaven.  We believers have it a little tougher.  There are those who claim rejection of Jesus condemns you, but I doubt you have been introduced to Jesus.  What you have seen is a caricature, the rejection of which is understandable to a merciful God.<br>  <br>  Just as commitment in marriage is need for a successful marriage, knowing God, loving God, and faithfulness to God is needed for a fully human life.

EVIDENCE.  There are dumb atheists as well as dumb creationists.  Peoples' beliefs do not make them dumb.....BUT rejection of  a strongly supported theory such as evolution merely <br>  by  personal incredulity is not a strong argument. Maybe he complains because so many creationists have the idea that creationism is science and is a legitimate alternative to evolution when it bears no relationship to science at all..and is unable to meet any of the criteria for science as outlined by the Frye and Daubert standards. Creationism is the age old.."dragon in my garage" story with no evidence but major league emotion and BELIEF. Since you believe without proof ..then any future proof would be always inadequate...your dragon is invisible and you need not have any evidence to support that stance.

yMVMi8Ucaa	Hi Ariel,<br>  <br>  Unfortunately there is no iron clad way to be certain that you have found your calling as God so often allows us to make decisions based upon the best information we have at the time. He does this to allow us to exercise our will and demonstrate that we desire Him above and beyond all other things. Ask yourself this: would you be prepared to give up your desire to be a recording gospel singer if God asked you to go to Brazil to work with street children instead? Would you be prepared to give it up if God asked you to... Sometimes we need to demonstrate our willingness to seek Him above all things ("yet not my will but your will be done") before the doors begin to open for us into the things we are passionate for.<br>  <br>  In addition, there is some confusion over whether God does indeed have a 'perfect individual will' for a person's life and whether we can then thwart that. It is my personal conviction that God's perfect will for us is to merely desire Him above all things and allow ourselves to have our desires molded to his desires. I do not necessarily believe that God has a perfect plan for each of us that we can miss. Certainly He has prepared good works in advance for us to do (Ephesians 2:10) - but I believe these are opportunities and not obligations. Certainly He knows us and so He calls us to do certain things within His Kingdom but I'm not convinced that, for instance, God desires above all things that you be a gospel singer... I believe He is more concerned with the type of gospel singer you would be. What is your character, what are your desires, where is your heart. These are the things that concern God the most because all else is temporal.<br>  <br>  After all, if God had a perfect individual will for you then perhaps even the smallest decisions you make could have an impact upon whether you will fulfill that will or not. For instance, did you pray over which breakfast cereal to eat this morning - it could have mattered... Did you pray over which sock to put on first - perhaps that might have changed things... When you start to believe that God has a perfect will then you have to determine that everything matters and every decision must be submitted to His leading and guidance - and indeed you could make the wrong one and that, we are told, is sinful...<br>  <br>  I cannot believe all this. Instead I am convinced that there is something of a blend. Certainly our decisions matter and we should subject ourselves to God and be prepared to respond to even the silliest of callings that we experience if we have a conviction they are from God. Certainly we must be prepared to submit ourselves to God an allow Him to act through our lives and decisions and so steer us to where He wants us to be. However, we must not get so consumed with worry about the decisions we make that we forget we have freedom in Christ and that freedom includes the freedom to serve according to our own heart and desires.<br>  <br>  I will leave you with this food for thought though:<br>  <br>  Finding God's will for me...<br>  <br>  1) Read the Bible and pursue a personal relationship with God, submitting yourself to His guidance.<br>  <br>  2) Examine honestly your gifts, skills and abilities. Do others think you have a voice that could make a recording artist or do they disagree. Perhaps you are not gifted in this area? Perhaps you are and you need to pursue it with greater passion?<br>  <br>  3) What do your circumstances point to? This is a difficult one because a closed door might be an indication to stop or to persevere. Perhaps we can only know for certain by persevering at first and honestly examining our hearts with accountability before our brothers and sisters in Christ. However, God determined the place and time for your birth so most certainly our situations and circumstances could be God ordained and for a reason.<br>  <br>  4) Examine your heart, dreams and desires. These can be God given and certainly God made us a particular way for a reason. God is passionate for the lost, broken, oppressed and poor of this world - are your desires consistent with this?<br>  <br>  5) Test everything against the conviction of the Spirit and the Word of God. Does your desire appear to be a good desire in accordance with God's word - are you desiring it for a good motive or a wrong motive. Is your desire to glorify God or yourself?<br>  <br>  6) Make yourself accountable to close brothers and sisters in Christ who can help guide you and challenge you when they feel you are pursuing a lost cause or encourage you when they feel something sit well with their Spirit. Remember, if two or three agree on something in Christ (of course this is deeper than simply what it says) then it shall be done. Perhaps the better way to say this would be if two or three have a witness in their hearts about the truth of a situation or a desire for a certain outcome then the desire must be God's and so we can be sure that it shall come to pass in His timing.<br>  <br>  7) Do something. Do all that you can to fulfill your dreams and desires. While the adage 'God helps those who help themselves' is not in the Bible, there is truth in it. It is far easier to steer a moving ship than a stationary one (indeed you cannot change the direction unless you are moving).<br>  <br>  I hope these principles help you honestly examine you heart and dreams and help you to be sure that you are earnestly seeking to glorify God. Remember 'seek first the kingdom of God and all these things shall be added to you'.<br>  <br>  May God bless you as you continue to serve Him and set your desires after Him.<br>  <br>  Your brother in Christ,<br>  Alex|`|xP8ML3j0aa	If you feel deep in your heart then it maybe your calling.<br>  But just ask God to guide you and show you the way.<br>  Dont worry if its ur calling God will help you achieve that. <br>  But you have to try and be patient.|`|7iywjGH5aa	Is normal if your having obstacles.If you really wish to sure of your calling keep praying and look for your church leader advise.Rely on God,He will prepare everything for you.|`|cxMcb48paa	God will give you the bricks but you've got to do the work to put them together. And it may take years of effort because success usually doesn't just arrive overnight. Definitely pray for guidance and patience. Be sure you have the talent also and know that even if you're a great singer it's still going to be a battle. Eva Cassidy had talent.

Or for the nuts and bolts of entering the music biz, perhaps a question in another category would help too. <br>  <br>  If it is your calling you will find success with your persistence.

We get strong in our ability to follow Him through the most difficult chapters of our lives.  <br>  <br>  It's said that only through the exercise of the virtue of fortitude is any other virtue exercised.  Only through courage can you be wise or just or chaste or any good at singing or anything else for that matter...<br>  <br>  Surround yourself with good wise Christians and read your Bible and pray always.

Against bullying.<br>  2. Depends on if the Christian started it.<br>  3. No, this continues the cycle.<br>  4. I don't know what you mean by "allowances".<br>  5. People are numbed by larger numbers of dead unless it's a VERY large number like half a million. Then they go "wow". It's called desensitization.<br>  6. I think that the rights of the minority are the same rights the majority has, but have not been allowed to the minorities by the majority. Therefore it becomes necessary to allow this, sometimes by lawsuit if the majority continues to refuse.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Your comments to me make absolutely no sense whatsoever. There are already laws in place for the victims to defend themselves if they so choose to. You apparently think that the victims should not be able to lawfully defend themselves against bullies. They should be able to.  <br>  <br>  Civil rights are civil rights. They are guaranteed by our Constitution for ALL legal citizens of this country. When the majority refuses to allow the minority access to their civil rights it becomes necessary for the minority to take the matter to the courts in order to obtain what is rightfully theirs.<br>  <br>  You know, sort of like how all holidays in schools used to be Christian centered? Never saw any Jewish holidays, or Muslim holidays, or pagan holidays, just Christian ones. Christmas plays, Easter plays, weeks off for Christian holidays. <br>  <br>  That's all changed now. In fact there were cases brought by Wiccans against schools which then gave up ALL their Christian holidays rather than include a Wiccan holiday.<br>  <br>  That's just sad. That's pitiful. That's called a religious dictatorship, and it is exactly what our Constitution is there to protect us from.<br>  <br>  Oh yes, and marriage too. Don't forget that. What pigs these heterosexual people be who think they are better than others, and deserve more to marry than homosexuals do who love each other and are committed to each other. <br>  <br>  It make me almost ashamed to be a heterosexual when I see my fellow heterosexuals acting like that.

(Turn-about is fair play)<br>  <br>  Do you think that they have the right to do that because <br>  they are victimized by society? (No, they have the right <br>  to do that because they are victimized by Christians.)<br>  <br>  Do you think that certain allowances must be made in <br>  order to even out the playing field? (Without a doubt.)<br>  <br>  Why is that when a 1000 people kill or murder, it is more <br>  justified than when only 10 people kill or murder? (Because<br>  it makes it look like there is some sort of acceptable reason<br>  behind it... like when the Christians mass-murdered millions<br>  of pagans... they got awat with that pretty good, huh ?)<br>  <br>  Why does the rights of the minority have to trump the rights <br>  of the majority?

Jesus is God in flesh (John 1:1,14;  Col. 2:9) and only God can satisfy the Law requirements of a perfect life and perfect sacrifice that cleanses us of our sins.<br>        All people have sinned against God.  But, God is infinitely holy and righteous.  He must punish the sinner, the Law breaker.  If He didn't, then His law is not law for there is no law that is a law without a punishment.  The punishment for breaking the Law is death, separation from God.  Therefore, we sinners need a way to escape the righteous judgment of God.  Since we are stained by sin and cannot keep the Law of God, then the only one who could do what we cannot is God Himself.  That is why Jesus is God in flesh.  He is both divine and human.  He was made under the Law (Gal. 4:5-6) and He fulfilled it perfectly.  Therefore, His sacrifice to God the Father on our behalf is of infinite value and is sufficient to cleanse all people from their sins and undo the offense to God.<br>         Jesus became sin for us and bore our sins in His body on the cross, thus fulfilling the Law.<br>  <br>      2 Cor. 5:21, "He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him."<br>      1 Peter 2:24, "and He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness; for by His wounds you were healed."<br>      Rom. 8:3-4, "For what the Law could not do, weak as it was through the flesh, God did: sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and as an offering for sin, He condemned sin in the flesh. in order that the requirement of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit."<br>  <br>   Therefore, salvation is by grace through faith since it was not by our keeping the Law, but by Jesus, God in flesh, who fulfilled the Law and died in our place.<br>  <br>      Eph. 2:8-9, "For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; 9 not as a result of works, that no one should boast."<br>      Gal. 3:13, "Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law, having become a curse for us—for it is written, "Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree."<br>      Eph. 5:2, "and walk in love, just as Christ also loved you, and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma."<br>  <br>  
zHle6Paqaa	The question as to who are the "brethren" to whom you refer, is not absolutely certain. The claim made that they were children of Joseph by an earlier marriage has been dismissed as untenable. Being older than Jesus, as they would have to be, our Lord could not be the "first-born," heir to the throne of David, as He is listed in the genealogies, if he had brothers through Joseph, according to Jewish Law. It is generally believed that James (afterwards Bishop of Jerusalem), Joseph, Simon and Jude were cousins of Jesus. They are held to be the sons of Mary, the wife of Cleophas (also called Alpheus), who was the Blessed Virgin’s cousin. They could not be called cousins, for there is no such word in the Hebrew or Aramaic language, hence the word cousin is not in any part of the Old Testament. The writers of Holy Writ were compelled to use the word Ah to describe kinsmen, which translated literally is brother. Calvin, the father of Protestant theology, in refuting Helvidius, who maintained that "brethren" referred to uterine brothers, said: "We have already stated that according to the Hebrews all relatives are called brothers."<br>  <br>  One thing is certain, it would not have been within the province of Jesus on the Cross to place His mother in the care of St. John if He had brothers (St. John 19:26, 27). Again, Jesus, and He alone, is called in the Bible "the Son of Mary" (St. Mark, 6:3).<br>  <br>  Nowhere in the scripture is there anyone called the son/daughter of Mary except for Jesus.|`|tRcO5uyiaa	There is nothing to believe in your statement. This character you call Hegesippus is a Roman Catholic saint. His writings are not in the Bible, they are a human's writings, the very same as the Book of Mormon is. The Catholic religion is not recognized by true believers, as it is a man-made religion. It is also not recognized by God. Read James 1:27. James (the disciple) is a brother to Jesus as equally as others are. Jesus tells us in this scripture:<br>  <br>  "Someone told him, 'Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you'. He replied to him, 'Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?' Pointing to his disciples, he said, 'Here are my mother and my brothers.

Brother is not to be taken literal:<br>  "the brethren of the Lord" (Matthew 12:46, 13:55; Mark 3:31-32, 6:3; Luke 8:19-20; John 2:12, 7:3-5; Acts 1:14; 1 Corinthians 9:5). <br>   such "brethren" [where sisters" are also referred to), namely, James ,Joseph, or Joses, Simon, and Jude. <br>  The identity of James, Jude and Simon<br>  James is without doubt the Bishop of Jerusalem, author of the first Catholic Epistle.<br>   His identity with James the Less (Mark 15:40) and the Apostle James, the son of Alpheus (Matthew 10:3; Mark 3:18), although contested by many Protestant critics, may also be considered as certain. There is no reasonable doubt that in Galatians 1:19: "But other of the apostles [besides Cephas] I saw none, saving James the brother of the Lord", St. Paul represents James as a member of the Apostolic college. The purpose for which the statement is made, makes it clear that the "apostles" is to be taken strictly to designate the Twelve, and its truthfulness demands that the clause "saving James" be understood to mean, that in addition to Cephas, St. Paul saw another Apostle, "James the brother of the Lord" (cf. Acts 9:27). Besides, the prominence and authority of James among the Apostles (Acts 15:13; Galatians 2:9; in the latter text he is even named before Cephas) could have belonged only to one of their number.<br>   Now there were only two Apostles named James: James the son of Zebedee, and James the son of Alpheus (Matthew 10:3; Mark 3:18; Luke 6:16; Acts 1:13).<br>   The former is out of the question, since he was dead at the time of the events to which Acts 15:6 ssq., and Galatians 2:9-12 refer (cf. Acts 12:2). <br>  James "the brother of the Lord" is therefore one with James the son of Alpheus, and consequently with James the Less, the identity of these two being generally conceded. Again, on comparing John 19:25 with Matthew 27:56, and Mark 15:40 (cf. Mark 15:47; 16:1), we find that Mary of Cleophas, or more correctly Clopas (Klopas), the sister of Mary the Mother of Christ, is the same as Mary the mother of James the Less and of Joseph, or Joses. As married women are not distinguished by the addition of their father's name, Mary of Clopas must be the wife of Clopas, and not his daughter, as has been maintained. Moreover, the names of her sons and the order in which they are given, no doubt the order of seniority, warrant us in identifying these sons with James and Joseph, or Joses, the "brethren" of the Lord. The existence among the early followers of Christ of two sets of brothers having the same names in the order of age, is not likely, and cannot be assumed without proof. Once this identity is conceded, the conclusion cannot well be avoided that Clopas and Alpheus are one person, even if the two names are quite distinct. It is, however, highly probable, and commonly admitted, that Clopas and Alpheus are merely different transcriptions of the same Aramaic word Halphai. James and Joseph the "brethren" of the Lord are thus the sons of Alpheus. <br>  Of Joseph nothing further is known. Jude is the writer of the last of the Catholic Epistles (Jude 1). He is with good reason identified by Catholic commentators with the "Judas Jacobi" ("Jude the brother of James" in the Douay Version) of Luke 6:16 and Acts 1:13, otherwise known as Thaddeus (Matthew 10:3; Mark 3:18). It is quite in accordance with Greek custom for a man to be distinguished by the addition of his brother's name instead of his father's, when the brother was better known. That such was the case with Jude is inferred from the title "the brother of James", by which he designates himself in his Epistle. About Simon nothing certain can be stated. He is identified by most commentators with the Symeon, or Simon, who, according to Hegesippus, was a son of Clopas, and succeeded James as Bishop of Jerusalem. Some identify him with the Apostle Simon the Cananean (Matthew 10:4; Mark 3:18) or the Zealot (Luke 6:15; Acts 1:13). The grouping together of James, Jude or Thaddeus, and Simon, after the other Apostles, Judas Iscariot excepted, in the lists of the Apostles, (Matthew 10:4-5; Mark 3:18; Luke 6:16; Acts 1:13) lends some probability to this view, as it seems to indicate some sort of connexion between the three. Be this as it may, it is certain that at least two of the "brethren" of Christ were among the Apostles. This is clearly implied in 1 Corinthians 9:5: "Have we not the power to carry about a woman, a sister, as well as the rest of the apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?" The mention of Cephas at the end indicates that St. Paul, after speaking of the Apostles in general, calls special attention to the more prominent ones, the "brethren" of the Lord and Cephas. The objection that no "brethren" of the Lord could have been members of the Apostolic college, because six months before Christ's death they did not believe in Him (John 7:3-5), rests on a misunderstanding of the text. His "brethren" believed in his mi|`|zPfgFXU5aa	The "Blessed Virgin Mary" did NOT remain a virgin.  Joseph had intimate relations with Mary after Jesus was born.  Joseph was her husband, what else would you expect?<br>  "Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife: And knew her not (this means he did not have relations with her) TILL SHE HAD BROUGHT FORTH HER FIRSTBORN SON: and he called his name JESUS." -Matthew 1:24-25 <br>  The Bible doesn’t say Joseph never ever had marital relations with Mary, only that he waited until AFTER Jesus was born.<br>  Jesus' unbelieving neighbours were stupefied by His power because they knew His whole family--His mother, Joseph, His SISTERS, and His BROTHERS.  When these unbelievers referred to Jesus' brothers and sisters they were in no wise be referring to His disciples.  It is obvious that they were talking about His physical family who they all knew and grew up with...<br>  "Is not this [referring to Jesus] the carpenter, the son of Mary, the BROTHER of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not HIS SISTERS here with us? And they were offended at him." -Mark 6:3<br>  John's gospel records a fulfilled prophesy from the book of Psalms--in it, Jesus tells us He has brothers and sisters. <br>  "And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up." -John 2:17<br>  "I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto MY MOTHER'S CHILDREN. For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me." -Psalms 69:8-9<br>  Why was He an alien to His mother's children? Because Jesus' brothers, his mother’s other children, did not believe in Him. <br>  "For neither did his brethren believe in him." -John 7:5<br>  The apostle Paul saw the Lord Jesus' brother James. <br>  "But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother." -Galatians 1:19<br>  The Catholic religion says the word translated "brother" should be "cousin". Wrong again. The word "cousin" is clearly found in the scripture and it means--you've got it—cousin! <br>  "And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren." -Luke 1:36<br>  "And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her." -Luke 1:58<br>   Cousins are cousins and brothers are brothers! But the Roman Catholic Church still insists these “brothers” were actually Jesus’ cousins even though in each instance the specific Greek word for “brother” is used. While the word can refer to other relatives, its normal and literal meaning is a physical brother. There was a Greek word for cousin, and it was not used. Further, if they were Jesus’ cousins, why would they so often be described as being with Mary, Jesus’ mother? There is nothing in the context of His mother and brothers coming to see Him that even hints that they were anyone other than His literal, blood-related half-brothers.<br>  An alternative Roman Catholic theory is that Jesus’ brothers and sisters were the children of Joseph from a previous marriage, before he married Mary. An entire theory of Joseph's being significantly older than Mary, having been previously married, having multiple children, and then being widowed before marrying Mary is invented. The problem with this is that there is no historical record of this and neither does the New Testament suggest that Joseph was married or had children before he married Mary. If Joseph had children before he married Mary, why are they not mentioned in Joseph and Mary’s trip to Bethlehem (Luke 2:4-7) or their trip to Egypt (Matthew 2:13-15) or their trip back to Nazareth (Matthew 2:20-23) and how could Jesus be Joseph's legal heir when that status is always held by the first born son, which in this case would have been one of Jesus' older brothers?? The bible on the other hand suggests Jesus is the first born son which means the other children came along later.<br>  Another objection by sceptics is that if Jesus had brothers why did he hand Mary over to his Disciple John? But if Jesus was who he claimed to be then he would have known that in the not too distant future his brothers would be hunted down and killed and all but one of his disciples would be executed. The one disciple to live to an old age and die of natural causes was John and that makes John the only logical choice to look after Mary who was already widowed and about to lose all her sons as well!|`|2bC0dvPKaa	Jesus doesn't have a brother...Are you talking about when people are referred to as "brother" as a sort of endearment, signifying strong love and friendship?|`|yQNit56Qaa	First, my position:  I am a Fundamentalist Christian.<br>  <br>  1) Catholics, if even Hegesippus said James is Jesus' Brother, why don't you believe?<br>  <br>  The reason is that Hegesippus (clearly) got his information from the bible (v 19)<br>  <a href="http://www.studybibleforum.com/htm_php.php3?do=jump_to_chapter&refstr=Gal+1%3A19&trans=NASB" rel="nofollow">http://www.studybibleforum.com/htm_php.p...</a><br>  <br>  We see **very clearly** in Paul's writings (and, indeed, throughout the New Testament) that the Greek word for "brother" is used time and time again to refer to people who are *not* siblings.

We see that *very* many individuals *are* so labeled, though.<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com</a>|`|02c88162bffef072e5382461e8afc7f3aa	Lion you just are bound and determined to find reasons to find fault with Catholic beliefs and once again your interpreting things wrong.The term brother was a more generic term used in that era to cover friends and fellow believers just like my best friend and i greet each other with the word brother.And when people see me or him they will say wheres your brother or hows your brother doing and no we do not look alike as he's mexican american and i'm euro american. So i guess you and rene-o and now jesus is lord former cj and can put your heads together and try again as your not near as much in knowledge as priest who've spent years in school or others of learning but thus is the problem of people like you and others who think there capable of interpreting the bible or early church fathers with out a historical understanding and proof is the more than 30,000 differing protestant beliefs or churches.Oh for your info if you read this again you will also learn that james the less whom your referring too his mother was Mary Cleophas the sister of the virgin Mary.|`|3PuKXEwZaa	Read Mark 3:18,Matt 13:55, and Galatians1:19. This James is seen as the same James you refer to who was Bishop in Jerusalem. This James is the son of Alpheus. So if the bible says James is the son of Alpheus he therefore cannot be the son of Joseph and Mary too.  He is called brother of the Lord in a spiritual sense. What say you?<br>  <br>  So, if it is established that the "brethren of the Lord" were not Jesus’ brothers or half-brothers through Mary, who were they?<br>  <br>  Prior to the time of Jerome, the standard theory was that they were Jesus’ "brothers" who were sons of Joseph though not of Mary. According to this view, Joseph was a widower at the time he married Mary. He had children from his first marriage (who would be older than Jesus, explaining their attitude toward him). This is mentioned in a number of early Christian writings. One work, known as the Proto-evangelium of James (A.D. 125) records that Joseph was selected from a group of widowers to serve as the husband/protector of Mary, who was a virgin consecrated to God. When he was chosen, Joseph objected: "I have children, and I am an old man, and she is a young girl" (4:9).<br>  <br>  Today, the most commonly accepted view is that they were Jesus’ cousins. Of the four "brethren" who are named in the Gospels, consider, for the sake of argument, only James. Similar reasoning can be used for the other three. We know that James the younger’s mother was named Mary. Look at the descriptions of the women standing beneath the cross: "among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee" (Matt. 27:56); "There were also women looking on from afar, among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome" (Mark 15:40).<br>  <br>  Then look at what John says: "But standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene" (John 19:25). If we compare these parallel accounts of the scene of the crucifixion, we see that the mother of James and Joseph must be the wife of Clopas. So far, so good.<br>  <br>  An argument against this, though, is that James is elsewhere (Matt. 10:3) described as the son of Alphaeus, which would mean this Mary, whoever she was, was the wife of both Clopas and Alphaeus. But Alphaeus and Clopas are the same person, since the Aramaic name for Alphaeus could be rendered in Greek either as Alphaeus or as Clopas. Another possibility is that Alphaeus took a Greek name similar to his Jewish name, the way that Saul took the name Paul.<br>  <br>  So it’s probable that James the younger is the son of Mary and Clopas. The second-century historian Hegesippus explains that Clopas was the brother of Joseph, the foster-father of Jesus. James would thus be Joseph’s nephew and a cousin of Jesus, who was Joseph’s putative son.<br>  <br>  This identification of the "brethren of the Lord" as Jesus’ first cousins is open to legitimate question—they might even be relatives more distantly removed—but our inability to determine for certain their exact status strictly on the basis of the biblical evidence (or lack of it, in this case) says nothing at all about the main point, which is that the Bible demonstrates that they were not the Blessed Virgin Mary’s children.<br>  <br>  So you were not entirely accurate when you quoted what Hegesippus meant now were you.  So why do you still not believe Mary to be ever virgin?|`|B6r56Nr7aa	The word for "brother" could have meant "nephew, uncle, etc." <br>  <br>  That's why we don't.

Mary never gave birth to any child except Jesus.<br>  <br>  No where in the bible does it state that Mary gave birth to another Child and I think that a sibling of Jesus would be important enough to document seeing how the bible records who beget who.<br>  <br>  If Jesus had bothers then why did he have the Apostle John care for his mother and not have a sibling do it?<br>  <br>  John 19:<br>  26 When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple there whom he loved, he said to his mother, "Woman, behold, your son." <br>  27 Then he said to the disciple, "Behold, your mother." And from that hour the disciple took her into his home. <br>  <br>  Peace be with you.
Piaez5DJaa	My first wife died twice,I was holding her hand the second time.She had conversations with Jesus both times.She is closer to God than any person I have ever met.You would be amazed or say I was lying if I began to tell you the things I have seen happen when she prays.She saw an angel standing like on sentry duty beside my bed one night,watching over me.He was nearly 8 feet tall.I personally have not seen angels,but have seen demons and ghosts in the past.I have met Jesus in his physical actual body.When Jesus stands face to face with you and looks you in the eye there is no doubt.Anyone wanting to discuss this more can contact me.|`|Y7aRTePiaa	I believe in angels, hopefully someday I aim to become one,  preferably of the risen. There are two that I know of at either side the river lie, and recently I've been having a spiritual crisis. Each time I feel or impulse, they are there to pick up the pieces or re-point the brick-work. Unforunately, the one that believes in me is busy in greater prominences, which I respect, but I know that shortly, his/her wings will embrace me with the blessed truth and I shall flutter as the bees to the hive and the birds to nest at dusk. Angels, in my short experience are signposts on an otherwise lonely road...|`|4JO2zYURaa	OK i do not believe in angels but this is what happened to me.......<br>  one night about 6 years ago I was trying to get some sleep, I was going through a rough time and I was feeling depressed. I had my eyes closed when i suddenly felt as if there was someone else in the room with me so I opened my eyes....... Right above me there was a blue Myst thick enough that i could not see the ceiling. I looked at it for about 10 seconds when suddenly through the Myst a face of a young woman appeared then her whole body slipped through the Myst. She was beautiful she had wings just like an angel she looked right at me with a straight face, I scowled at her I'm not sure why but i did, then she smiled. It was like the sun suddenly appearing from behind a particularly dark cloud words cannot describe how that smile seemed to burn away all my negativity and replace it with total calm and peace. I just layed there soaking it up like a sunbather for a couple of minuets (quite possibly the best 2 minuets of my life) then after that i just couldn't help myself and i slowly reach up with my right hand to try and touch her face, but as i did so she just disappeared back into the Myst again and then the Myst vanished....... to this day I'm not sure whether it was real of an hallucination and I wish I had not reach out to her and just stayed looking at her forever :)........ xx|`|mPgUg5rbaa	i have never had my own personal experience with angels..but i definetly believe in them.

fdpk0t3faa	Before I start: Yes i am a Christian.<br>  <br>  (1) The Theory of Evolution has absolutely nothing to do with the Big Bang people. That obviously is the Big Bang Theory, which people often couple with the Theory of Evolution to explain great amounts of time.<br>  <br>  (2) The Theory of Evolution does NOT say that we come from Monkeys/Apes/Gorillas or any other type of primate. It states that we share a common ancestor which our species deviated hundreds of millions of years ago to evolve into the species that we are today.  Because of the common ancestor, today we still share almost 96% of the same DNA with Chimpanzee; the differences being that humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes while Chimpanzees have 24 pairs.  Somewhere down the line human chromosomes fused together to combine chromosomes which permanently shifted our pelvis in such a way that we would walk upright.<br>  <br>  Now as for the Theory of Evolution: Darwin's Theory of Evolution is actually very, very simple.  Because there are limited resources on this planet, all species must compete within its own species and against others to survive.  All of these species have variations in sizes, strengths, etc. Just as humans do today.  The Theory goes that the animals with the variations that give the animal the best chance of survival will survive and pass those variations on and on.  Eventually the spread of this variation will reach across the entire species.  <br>  <br>  This is what Darwin's Original Theory of Evolution is, the modern day extremities of "evolution" is actually called Abiogenesis.  Which literally means "the origin of life," is the study of how life began and uses Darwin's Theory of Evolution to explain how we came from single celled organisms into the homosapiens we are today.<br>  <br>  Hope that is good enough for you there. If you have anymore questions, let me know :-)<br>  <br>  I also saw that someone said that we do not have any fossil records of transitional species and there is no transitional species found today.  As for fossils, we do not have any fossils that are labeled "transitional," however, we have quite a lot of fossils that we know belong to a certain species but can't quite figure out where they belong.  We can't be certain whether this is a "transitional" fossil, or that it is simply a mutation in the current species, etc.  There are many reasons however for the lack of overwhelming transitions.  For one, fossils are extremely rare, many people think that when you die, your bones become fossils. This is absolutely not true! There are many conditions that must be met for a fossil to form over the course of time.  Two, "transitional" fossils can't be found or labeled because "transitional" is a subjective term. We don't know what we are looking at when we see a fossil, all we can do is compare to the fossils that we already have. If one finds a raptor skeleton for example which happens to be must smaller than most, we don't know if this is a raptor who is just a small adult, or if it is the beginning of an evolutionary trait to evolve into smaller, lighter animals that will eventually become birds.  We forget that the time involved for this stuff to happen is incredible! So we of course aren't going to see "transitional" fossils like that same Raptor with wings for arms.  Doesn't happen like that.<br>  <br>  Also, because of the great time involved, we can definitely say that there are species alive today, in fact, all species today are in the process of evolving, it just takes so much time that we will never notice.  Take a Walrus for example, is this an animal that God just created to live in water and on land? Is this a sea creature who is adapting and evolving to be ale to be on land? Is this a land creature who is evolving into a sea animal (unlikely)? We cannot say for sure because well anyones 50-100 years on this planet is enough to see absolutely nothing in the evolutionary time scales of 100,000,000s years for simple traits to be evident, let along major shifts in traits.|`|OKCpqWoAaa	in an evolutionary nutshell,..pretend it does happen,..evolutionary mind psyche,..<br>  <br>  there was nothing, then a rock then a man and then according to evolution all will go back to a rock,..and this all happened over billions of years,..so that would mean my strawberry jam could evolve into.......................?<br>  <br>  no offense, but it is good you fear the bible quotes,..<br>  <br>  i would also ask how science can explain finding petrified trees going up through all the layers of sediment in their sedimentary chart of billions of years of evolution and one of these trees is upside down,..<br>  <br>  please hav science properly calibrate their time measuring equipment,..for the earth was created before the stars, neighbor,..<br>  <br>  did God create man or did man create god,..we are all here on purpose, and you hav found yorz,..braaavo,..<br>  <br>  find my hypobaric chamber posts, neighbor,..and locate yor dinosaur,..<br>  <br>  i e a e,..<br>  avatar of the unification,..|`|rtvR4wDfaa	I've heard a few variations, but the gist I've gotten is:<br>  Billions of years ago smalls particles were drawn into each other, spinning quickly.

It wrote itself over billions of years. honest.<br>  <br>  Evolution is the theory that a tiny cell reproduced, it's offspring had mutations and the cells that could live to reproduce would continue living. Over trillions of years, every animal evolved. <br>  <br>  The theory goes against one of the basic rules of science that you learn in 6th grade, a living organism must come from another living organism. Never does it say that a living organism can come from years of chemical reactions, etc, etc.<br>  <br>  Look around. Do you really think everything came from a couple of bacteria cells? Just look at your hand. Go on, look. Do you think that was because of chance?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Edit;<br>  Just wanted to add this;<br>  The problem is we have no transitional forms or skeletons. There is a huge gap in the fossil record. Without those there is no way to prove evolution is true. There would have to be thousands and thousands of them. The truth is, all of them are missing. But they never really existed. The pictures of the transitional forms are all drawings. I wonder why. There is no connection between man and ape. <br>  <br>  Here are examples of the only ‘proof’ (that backfired) the scientists have.<br>  Lucy- Australopithecus aferensis- an three foot tall chimpanzee.<br>  Nebraska Man- Hesperopithecus haroldcookii- they only had a tooth, that turned out to belong to an extinct pig.<br>  Piltdown man- Eoathropus dawsoni- The skull of a modern ape.<br>  Neanderthal Man- Homo neanderthalensis- the skeleton of a French man with arthritis.<br>  <br>  “The extreme rarity (AKA none)of transitional forms in the fossil records persists as the trade secret of paleontology…” -Harvard Teacher Stephen Jay Gould|`|nU6snz4Maa	Well a simplified definition of evolution is a process of something changing over time. Darwinian evolution (or biological evolution) pertains to the changing of species over time through the genes, its a chemical and physical process that has to do mainly with the fields of biology, chemistry, and for a smaller extent psychology and the social sciences. It's refered to as "darwinian" evolution because Charles Darwin first proposed the idea of evolution by natural selection as a way of explaining the varieties of the species.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately the common definitions of evolution outside of the scientific community are different. For example, in the Oxford Concise Science Dictionary we find the following definition:<br>  <br>      "evolution: The gradual process by which the present diversity of plant and animal life arose from the earliest and most primitive organisms, which is believed to have been continuing for the past 3000 million years."<br>  <br>  This is inexcusable for a dictionary of science. Not only does this definition exclude prokaryotes, protozoa, and fungi, but it specifically includes a term "gradual process" which should not be part of the definition. More importantly the definition seems to refer more to the history of evolution than to evolution itself. Using this definition it is possible to debate whether evolution is still occurring, but the definition provides no easy way of distinguishing evolution from other processes. For example, is the increase in height among Caucasians over the past several hundred years an example of evolution? Are the color changes in the peppered moth population examples of evolution? This is not a scientific definition.<br>  <br>  Standard dictionaries are even worse.<br>  <br>      "evolution: ...the doctrine according to which higher forms of life have gradually arisen out of lower.." - Chambers<br>  <br>      "evolution: ...the development of a species, organism, or organ from its original or primitive state to its present or specialized state; phylogeny or ontogeny" - Webster's <br>  <br>  These definitions are simply wrong. Unfortunately it is common for non-scientists to enter into a discussion about evolution with such a definition in mind. This often leads to fruitless debate since the experts are thinking about evolution from a different perspective. When someone claims that they don't believe in evolution they cannot be referring to an acceptable scientific definition of evolution because that would be denying something which is easy to demonstrate. It would be like saying that they don't believe in gravity!<br>  <br>  Recently I read an article about a creationist who claimed that scientists are being dishonest when they talk about evolution. This person believed that evolution was being misrepresented to the public. The real problem is that the public, and creationists, do not understand what evolution is all about. This person's definition of evolution was very different from the common scientific definition and as a consequence he was unable to understand what evolutionary biology really meant. This is the same person who claimed that one could not "believe" in evolution and still be religious! But once we realize that evolution is simply "a process that results in heritable changes in a population spread over many generations" it seems a little silly to pretend that this excludes religion!<br>  <br>  Science needs to work harder to convey the correct information. Sometimes they don't succeed very well but that does not mean that they are dishonest. On the other hand, the general public, and creationists in particular, need to also work a little harder in order to understand science. Reading a textbook would help.|`|5e50c0ab71cc45110b7754fc5ce9ee2daa	I have but one thing to say.<br>  <br>  Why, in all of the billions and billions of years that evolutionists say the world has been here, has the been only one intelligent species evolve?<br>  <br>  Surely, others would have paralleled humanity in their evolution.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Kp|`|QDFj9JPfaa	...why do you ask only "Christians" ?

Then, as it reproduced, it is said, it changed into different kinds of living things, ultimately producing all forms of plant and animal life that have ever existed on this earth.

(University of Paris, University of Bolonga)  The first Universities in America were for the education of Anglican Clergy (Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School," passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut on October 9, 1701 in an effort to create an institution to train ministers. Soon thereafter, a group of ten Congregationalist ministers led by James Pierpont, all of whom were alumni of Harvard (the only North American college during their youth), met in the study of Reverend Samuel Russell in Branford, Connecticut, to pool their books to form the school's first library....Harvard College, established in 1635 by vote of the Great and General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, was named for its first benefactor, John Harvard of Charlestown, a young minister who, upon his death in 1638, left his library and half his estate to the new institution.The charter creating the corporation of Harvard College was signed by Massachusetts Governor Thomas Dudley in 1650. The College's original purpose was to train Puritan ministers.)<br>  <br>  There is also the long history of the Catholic School system, including such institutions as Notre Dame, and the Charity Schools for the poor that were run by the Protestant Evangelicals of Victorian England<br>  <br>  Don't forget that the learning of the ancient world was preserved in the West almost exclusively through the work of Catholic Monks....mostly Irish <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/03/09/bsp/irish.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/03/09/bs...</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_the_Irish_Saved_Civilization" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_the_Iri...</a><br>  <br>  Gladitorial Combat...

In the ancient world there were no charities.

The idea of a soceity of upper or middle class people who "gave back to the community" in the form of an organized charity is an idea that had its origin in the English evangelical churches of the Victorian Era. <br>  <br>  And there was the Catholic Worker movement, Dorothy Day, and Hull House.<br>  <br>  I could go on, but I need to get to work. <br>  <br>  Oh...and on science lets not forget Brother Gregor Mendel's groundbreaking work in Genetics, and the astronomical work of the 17th Century Anglican Clergymen, such as John Flamsteed (first Astronomer Royal) and Jeremiah Horrox and of course the Vatican Observatory.|`|fdb2eb2f4c9344e092dc65cdb24a9c1eaa	The intellectual climate that gave rise to modern science (roughly three centuries ago) was decisively shaped by Christianity.

EjVm8K0Xaa	Because in the earlier generations they worked around the farms and homes, went to school, came home and worked some more. They lived hard lives and did not have a lot of the luxuries they younger generations have. The make up the girls wore were harsher and harder on the skin, kids spent a lot of time outdoors which ages the skin. Kids were poor, and worried, and times were hard. Kids now a days have few worries, all kinds of skin care products, everything handed to them on a silver platter. They dont walk to school, they get in their sports car and drive. No garden, or cows to milk in order to eat supper, just go to McDonalds. No worries about things, just mommy and daddy handing out the allowance, or the car keys. Kids now a days have fun that older generations never had to consider. I was born in 1969, and even I remember hard times growing up in the 70's.

AA12360689	You are right.  God is not like that.  Religion has misrepresented God and what hell is.  It is not a place of eternal torment.  Hell is the grave where the dead are.  They are not suffering because Ecclesiastes 9:5 tell us, "For the living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all."  So they are not in torment.<br>  In fact, under the thousand year rule of Jesus as king of God's Kingdom as spoken of in Revelation the dead will be resurrected back to life and since hell is just the grave they come out of hell just as Revelation 20:13 says, "And the sea gave up those dead in it, and death and Ha′des gave up those dead in them, and they were judged individually according to their deeds."<br>  The idea of a hell where people are tortured forever is a God-dishonoring teaching.  It is not what the Bible REALLY teaches.|`|759ae5ae6e1570ab62326b25526ef339aa	Jesus proved he is God in human flesh by his resurrection from the dead, and he said many times that there is a hell.|`|bK5MJCxhaa	Sounds reasonable to me. |`|fdb2eb2f4c9344e092dc65cdb24a9c1eaa	The old-fashioned conception of Hell as a place of flesh being seared on sizzling grids, of torture devices and of extreme physical pain really isn't scriptural. In contrast the components of eternal punishment in the Bible are shame and disgrace. Rather, most Christians have understood these descriptions to capture symbolically that hell is final and utter separation from God's saving grace.<br>  <br>  The 'logic' of hell in the bible is surprisingly simple: You receive back the treatment/effects you gave other agents (including God and yourself) with some kind of multiplier effect. [The bible is full of images of this reciprocity concept: reaping what you sow, being paid back, unkindness for unkindness shown, apathy for apathy rendered, 'eye for an eye', proportional judgement, etc] You dishonor God; you receive dishonor in return. Appropriately your required response is to acknowledge your own need -- in effect, giving up your "honor" -- by admitting that you need God's help to pay the debt. <br>  <br>  Some Christians, like C. S. Lewis, take hell to be a real place where sinful people make themselves miserable. Similarly, thinking of heaven as a place of hedonistic pleasures is wrongheaded as well. In fact, those who choose hell would not enjoy the pleasures of heaven since those pleasures essentially flow from a right relationship with God.|`|yPSsfoejaa	The word "Hell" almost every place it is translated simply means grave.<br>  <br>  The Bible actually claims that all go to the heavenly dimension, Ecc 12:6,7 and 2Cor 5:8.<br>  <br>  Many have taught it wrong and out of context which has led to fear mongering.<br>  <br>  What the Bible does claim is that at the end of the age, God is the fire that consumes all evil.<br>  <br>  Dt 4:24 For the LORD your God is a consuming fire<br>  <br>  Hb 12:29 For our God is a consuming fire.<br>  |`|OCkIkgSPaa	Good for you!

If we DO want Him now in this lifetime, He will guarantee we have Him later.<br>  Completely fair, and it is that simple.<br>  If there were NO hell, then why did Jesus warn about it more than any subject?<br>  If there is no hell, why did God the Father send His Son to die for our sins?<br>  If the Bible speaks of hell in a literal way, and it does, why not accept the fact that this place exists?<br>  On this side of life, we are given a choice. <br>  What will you do with Jesus?<br>  There are some things which are hard to understand, some things hard to accept.

In (Mark 9:43-48) Jesus gave physical characteristics of hell.<br>  Human laws demands that justice be met upon wrongdoers, and punishment is given out accordingly; therefore,  men who have broken and sinned against God's holy law can expect punishment. "God is too good to send men to Hell" is often heard. <br>  God is good, and God LOVES all men; but his love does not cover a sinner from His justice (Jn. 3:16-18, 36). <br>  God gives the sinner every chance - loves them, sent His Son to atone, and constantly pleads with sinners to repent (Rom. 5:8).<br>  If a man is damned eternally to Hell, it is not Gods fault.<br>  If you can find time today then listen to this sincere experience of Bill Weise and see if it does not sound very credible.<br>  God bless.<br>  <a href="http://www.metacafe.com/watch/852697/23_minutes_in_hell_reference_edition/" rel="nofollow">http://www.metacafe.com/watch/852697/23_...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  |`|2CBxqNcaaa	One day you will know, for sure.

And likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does.  5  Do not deprive one another except with consent for a time, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again so that Satan does not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.<br>  |`|fEN3ZGSQaa	Well thats like saying that your half christian theres no such thing either you believe in all of the beliefs of a religion or you don't theres no in between thats like saying I am christian but I dont believe Jesus died for our sins or I am christian but I don't believe in heaven or hell your either all or none when it comes to religion|`|faHLkd7maa	I am told by those who study such matters at a much higher level than Sunday church that the Bible does not say that sex before marriage is a sin - churches teach that.|`|9yP43Peiaa	The church of england embrace it.. <br>  <br>  Its not a sin anymore|`|XKecXwZkaa	The Bible speaks out strongly against adultery - that is, being unfaithful to your spouse.

Now, if you're supposedly to avoid touching a Qur'an altogether, how on God's green Earth are you to read it??? Ask him for the solution, o wise one. (Okay okay, that last snark is from me, wouldn't be useful for you, lol)<br>  <br>  If he's gonna give you grief when you're trying, let him come up with the solution.

Yeah it's translated into English but that's for people who can't read aramaic.. If it interests you, i suggest you keep reading it, but in an attempt to understand islam, the Koran is a very complex book to actually grasp, i suggest you do abit of research and study, then maybe move onto the Koran<br>  <br>  Edit: Hey, just saw your edit.. it's awesome that you actually wanna start doing what you're doing. Im exactly the same, i took a little course on the customs and laws of 5 major world religions (Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Islam and Christianity) and found it VERY interesting.. wasnt very in depth but gained a better understanding of each of them (particularly hinduism, islam and judaism).. Although i am an Atheist and believe there is no god and am set on it for the rest of my life, like you, i wanna gain as much knowledge as i can on religion in general and the different religions..

He is wrong, he is dumb, and he is  a snob.  His Imam would slap him upside the head if he knew what crap he was spewing.  <br>  <br>  How does he think that people BECOME Muslims?  By STUDYING the Qu'ran, first of all.  <br>  <br>  So long as you behave as a "person of the book" (someone who believes that there is only one God, as Ibrahim/Abraham proclaimed)  and you treat the book respectfully, you are OK with all but the kooky people, like your friend,  who apparently "pretend" to be Muslims.   His behavior and his words towards you are UN - ISLAMIC in the EXTREME.   <br>  <br>  Here's the truth--Indonesian Muslims, Iranian Muslims, Afghan Muslims, Phillipine Muslims, American, English and Australian Muslims-- almost none of them can SPEAK ARABIC.   It's a HARD language to learn.  Almost none of them can read the florid language in the Qu'ran , even if they could read the Arabic script, which most cannot, and be able to figure out what it says.  <br>  <br>   They memorize chunks of the text  (phonetically, usually)  like an altar boy learning the Latin (back in the day when the Roman Catholic mass was in Latin!).    When they "study the Qu'ran" an Imam TRANSLATES the meaning of the text TO them. Many of them, in religious school, take their lessons in their NATIVE tongue--not arabic.  <br>  <br>  If your friend is not Arabic, turn on Al-Jazeera and insist that he translate it for you--when he can't, ask him how the hell he can read his Quran, then?  Then call him a TOOL--because that is what he is.<br>  <br>  Who does this tool think he is kidding?    A massive chunk of the Islamic world is ILLITERATE.  What, are they not Muslims because they can't read the text?  Please.  <br>  <br>  Tell your STUPID friend that he needs to go speak to his Imam, and to grow up, and stop trying to suggest that his faith is somehow EXCLUSIVE, when it isn't.  He is a BAD MUSLIM to tell someone who is learning about the faith to stop--Islam is quite universal, and while it is not a prosletyzing faith, it is a faith that draws people to it in its own way.  His actions, by trying to keep you from learning the faith, is AGAINST Islam...he should know better, too.  Perhaps he wants to be "special" at the workplace?  Maybe he's afraid if you learn about the faith, you can call him on his bullshit when he demands  a day off for a holiday that doesn't call for it, or something?<br>  <br>  I have a Qu'ran that was printed in MECCA that is in both Arabic and English--ask Mister Genius how THAT squares with his idiotic "rules" about who may handle a Qu'ran and what a "proper" Qu'ran looks like in terms of language.  FWIW, you can't get into Mecca if you aren't Muslim.  <br>  <br>  You can even find the Qu'ran in English ONLINE.  <br>  <br>  How does he think people make a decision to join the faith?  By OSMOSIS?  <br>  <br>  In fact, the prevailing view within Islam is that everyone is BORN A MUSLIM, it is only parents and cultures and circumstance that separate people from their birthright faith.  <br>  <br>  Your friend is a snob, a jerk, a liar,  and he is doing more with his stupid attitude to damage Islam's reputation than a dozen "swarthy turbaned fellows with curved knives" hanging around a daycare center could do.  <br>  <br>  Your friend is WRONG, too.  Islamic organizations put the Quran in many languages (see the last link) ON THE NET in order so that people can learn about Islam.  <br>  <br>  <br>  I've provided a load of links for you.  <br>  <br>  Trust me, your friend is an IDIOT.  And he's DEAD WRONG.  <br>  |`|2wqJ3D2faa	I am muslim, and the quran true text is in arabic, but that does not mean that the tralation version is incorrect,they are tralstated by scholars, and they are just as good as the orginal ..<br>  Your stupid muslim co worker does not know that muslims are supposed to teach other non muslim people about Islam, he is so stupid to tell you not to read hte quran..In m y mosque there are many non muslims who come and they want to learn, and the imam ( the islamic preist) gives all of them a quran..HOw stupid can that idiot co worker be, You should carry on and read hte quran and learn, what he said is just bull ****..<br>  <br>  Best of all go to a local mosque and learn, have them give you a quran and teach you, they will teach you better..<br>  |`|0Jds2xBoaa	Its complete nonscence, a nonmuslim can read or touch quran,<br>  Muslims respect quran very much, when they read it they clean themself and handle it in very respectful manner.<br>  But a nonmuslim will not do the same and we are afraid that a nonmuslim may insult it , so most of muslims are afraid to give quran to a nonmuslim.<br>  If next time a muslim tell you not to touch quran then ask him to show any verse of quran where it is written that quran should not be given to a nonmuslim.|`|w6KRRJOsaa	You should not listen to your co worker, since he does not seem to have much knowlege of Islam.

This is a very benifical act. Muslims who do this get "swaab" which means their good deeds get extended..Actually, its the biggest good deed one muslim can do, is to give quran to a non muslim who is intrested in Islam.

He use to be God’s most beautiful angel until he said he could be as great as God… angles are also Gods first creation.  Hell was created for them; hell is separation from God with different degrees of suffering.  God’s desire is that no man shall perish, and it is your choice where you will be Heaven or Hell your free will to choose.    <br>  <br>  de·ism (dē'?z'?m, dā'-)<br>  n.

Well, we were all created in God’s image.  And one of those images is eternal life.  He has been in existence for eternity, and the moment we are born our spirit will live for eternity.

Gnosticism doesn't have anything at all to do with belief or apathy.  Agnosticism is not a middle ground.  Gnosticism is having "special" knowledge on the existence or nature of god(s).  Agnosticism is being without that special knowledge.  Some of the most devout Christians I've met have been agnostic.

Qlo4ZWGraa	Earth has been periodically visited for thousands of years by BENEVOLENT ALIENS of such technical and psychic superiority that their powers, while no match for Jehovah's, are nonetheless nothing short of "Godlike" to we roaches, the Human Race. These BENIGN SPACE MONSTERS, the "X-ists," have walked among us throughout history, investigating and sometimes resisting the subatomically-pervading presence of Jehovah 1. We are not, then, alone in our battle/subservience. The rise and "fall" of Atlantis, the erection of the Pyramids and other monuments which NO SLOPEHEADS ALONE COULD BUILD, the miracles of the Old Testament, all these and more are events so inextricably interwoven with the invisible background war between Jehovah and the Xists that all the "Ancient Astronaut" fossils in the world furnish only the barest of clues. (The movie rights ALONE to these gut-splitting tales of reincarnancient history are worth MILLIONS!) Yea, it has even been suggested that the Carpenter of Nazareth himself, God Jr., Jesus 'What, Me Worry?' Christ, was in actuality a 'space detective' of the Xists, walking the Earth in human form with the mission of extricating us from the Monster God's grip.<br>  <br>  The black shadow of the Conspiracy, unfortunately, has seen to it that even His teachings were diluted and distorted until human attempts to follow them were fully as misguided as the carving of the heads of Easter Island or the 'runways' of Nazca.<br>  <br>  And so the true history of the SubGenius has been kept secret from Man. For Jehovah 1 is to the Xists and Us what a hungry fisherman is to a prize fish and his favorite pet worm - the last in the can. How many million other races were used before us in these ghastly galactic water-sports?<br>  <br>  Hail Bob!|`|cpOtr6Thaa	We don't know that the big bang happened anymore than God speaking the earth into existence, because no one was there.  The Bible has been around with it's literal 6-day creation for thousands of years, a book supposedly written (inspired) by the one who created the world, which sounds like a fairy tale to some.  The big bang is a scientific theory that can't be proven in a lab.  <br>  <br>  What I'm saying is...whatever theory you choose to believe, you have to take it on faith.  <br>  <br>  So here's a big question for you. If my life is by accident, with no greater meaning or purpose and I end up as worm food, what does it matter that I have religious beliefs?  Can't I just go happily about my life believing a so-called fairytale?<br>  <br>  And...if we just end up as dust why do evolutionists care so much about the progress of society?  What does it benefit them?|`|knOdcrDkaa	Because religion is about more than the origin of humanity, and some religions have no problem with a natural origin.|`|AA11307468	So, to you, the only two choices are religion OR the Big Bang Theory?

So you beleive in Big Bang and you don't in religion. Good for you. You asked WHY others have a religion, you don't need to try and force your beleifs on others after asking their opinion. That comes across as entrapment, something many atheists blame Christians for doing. So now it's ok for you to do it to others but no one can do it to you?

And that the Catholic Church compiled the Bible which Fundies try so desperately but ineffectively to self-interpret.  The Catholic Church is not a Christian Church - it is THE Christian Chuch.  All others are actually semi-Christian, having rejected many of the beliefs and practices of original and complete Christianity.|`|KILFoc6kaa	That bothers me.  To me a Christian is someone who accepts Jesus as their Lord and Savior.<br>  <br>  It also bothers me when people tell me just because I do not go to their particular church I am going to hell, because no where does my bible say that.

Based on many of the teaching of the Catholic Church, I will be surprised if many are, but I have no doubt that some Catholics have truly trusted Jesus Christ as their Saviour.  <br>  <br>  But, I can also say the same thing with most organized religions.  Even in my own denomination, there are many that simply try to get someone to say a prayer and get baptized, and then proudly declare they are saved.  However, many probably are not.  This is not what salvation is all about, or how it is obtained.<br>  <br>  Salvation is through faith in the finished work of Jesus Christ on the Cross.  It is obtained by turning from ones self and sin, and turning to Jesus Christ alone.  It really does not involve the prayer (although praying is good).  It does not involve baptism (although we are commanded to be baptized).  It does not involve partaking of the Lords Supper (although we are told to do it in remembrance of Jesus).<br>  <br>  Salvation is all about Jesus Christ, and none about us.<br>  <br>  "for by grace are you saved through faith, and that is not of yourself, it is a gift of God. Not by works least any man should boast"  Eph. 6:8-9|`|t88527U1aa	Yes it is,Many of the Catholic faith are Christians as they have invited Christ into their lives. Problem arises from fact that many in the church believe by going to church they are saved or listening to the Father or confession. Only thing that saves anyone is Jesus Christ and belief and invitation of him into our life.|`|liJKE5B2aa	They aren't. They take things out of the bible as it suits them. If they follow the doctrine of the self-appointed "Vicar of Christ on Earth", they're not Christian.

They were just "born Catholic". Neither are they encouraged in any way to read the scriptures. If perhaps they might venture to try, the HRCC says that only their hierarchy has the right to say what it means; and that the Teaching Authority and Traditions of their church are the yardstick by which the scriptures are measured.<br>  <br>  Most Catholics I know are very open, loving and caring. They believe in Jesus and don't have a problem with miracles being able to happen today. Many are even filled with the Holy Spirit.  So, praise God!  He still looks at the heart of a person and sees our intentions and sincerity. Doctrine is not necessary for faith.<br>  <br>  So, who are we to deny water (baptismal entrance into the church) to these upon whom the Holy Ghost fell, just like on us at the beginning?<br>  <br>  "Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?"<br>  (Acts 10:47)<br>  <br>  And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning. ... Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God?<br>  (Acts 11:15-17)<br>  <br>  So, my Catholic brethren, have you been baptized SINCE you believed?|`|FirFhrdnaa	Im a Protestant and my husband's a Catholic...We both believe in Jesus Christ and the bible says ANYONE who calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. If you believe  in Christ and live according to the word of God you are a Christian. Why do Protestants and Catholics argue so much when both of our faiths are based on the same thing? Christ!|`|XXjcHdxxaa	Really no one should say anyone isnt a christian. Only God can judge their heart. Also god said not bash other religions that worship him because they are his people too.

IDZTtipeaa	I try to follow the science, which can be difficult in such a politicized issue.<br>  From what I can see, it's not looking good.<br>  <br>  Some common misinformation keeps making its way out.  The "10 year cooling trend" is a common one.  1998 was an anomally.  El Nino caused unusual warming.  The overall trend is still up.  Using an anomolous data point to start will yield less than representative results.<br>  Another is the "CO2 follows warming".  This is true.  Increased CO2 is a feedback of a warming atmosphere.  This does not preclude CO2 from being a contributor.  On the contrary, CO2 is a cause and a feedback, thus the difficulty in predictions for future climates.  CO2 will be greatly increased as tundra thaws, the oceans will reach their maximum absorption rate, etc.  Climate models are useful, but not totally accurate.<br>  Past warming cycles is brought up a lot, as well.  Warming can be caused by many things.  There is some good, though incomplete, information showing WHY there was warming in the past.  This bit of information is not ignored by climatologists, nor does it mean what we are experiencing now is normal or shares a source from past cycles.|`|OLiH8pSvaa	I'm a Christian, but I believe that climate change is real and that we should do more to take care of God's earth.|`|ee08b687b5ca665f680a54a91f18d5deaa	Too many scientists and climatologists saying its real (a vast majority)|`|p4qfOf0Laa	Global warming is very real and very serious.

It WILL happen again.  The notion of there ever having been a stable climate is pure fantasy - the geological record shows massive fluctuations in climate in the past - both much warmer and much colder than it is now.<br>  <br>  Eventually, the climate will shift again.

The climate has changed many times in the course of history, and humans have not been on this earth long enough to determine whether or not we created this current climate change. For all we know it could simply be a natural change. If today's modern media was around before the ice age I wonder what excuses they would have come up for that. The environment will not stay the same forever, and anyone who thinks it should is delusional.<br>  <br>  I think the global warming paranoia is an example of what happens when people believe everything the media tells them. As soon as Al Gore started flying around on his private jet to hold conventions on global warming, the media went all over it, and that's when people started to become paranoid about it, and then came the movies like "Day After Tomorrow" showing the destruction of major coastal cities, then came the "environmentally friendly" products at the store which cost twice as much as regular ... so I think it's mostly paranoia fueled by the media and by major corporations that are trying to capitalize on that paranoia by selling "environmentally friendly" products at high costs to make a profit.|`|sW6lxVFOaa	It is real.

But, it hadn't produced any "fruits." <br>  <br>  This unfruitful fig tree was a symbol of the ancient Jewish nation.

Jesus is God with skin. Jesus made that tree to begin with,  In the book of Genesis,  Adam & Eve wore Fig leafs to cover their private areas, after they sinned against God by eating the forbidden fruit. In scripture the fig tree, it's leaves, & fruit is symbolic of sin. Picture a tree that's fruit is pure sin (or poison) for all to eat, Death would abound everywhere, young & old, But Jesus, came to take away the sin of the world, and Conquered. So Him saying "may no one eat of that tree ever again"(referring to the rein of sin world wide), is totally right on with why the Father sent his Son (Jesus) in the first place. With Jesus, your sin withers away immediately. Just like in Matthew 21:19... That is what I call Hardcore...<br>    - You should start going to Bible studies & mature in the Holy Scriptures so you can answer Hard questions like the one you asked ...|`|D1okvq9Oaa	I can tell that you don't really want an answer.  You like your concept of the text and won't accept anything else.  Well, here's the answer for those seeking to know the truth.<br>  <br>  Why did Jesus curse the fig tree, when figs weren't in season?<br>  Some light is shed on this passage by an article in Hard Sayings of the Bible by F. F. Bruce:<br>  <br>  Was it not unreasonable to curse the tree for being fruitless when, as Mark expressly says, "it was not the season for figs"? The problem is most satisfactorily cleared up in a discussion called "The Barren Fig Tree" published many years ago by W. M. Christie, a Church of Scotland minister in Palestine under the British mandatory regime. He pointed out first the time of year at which the incident is said to have occurred (if, as is probable, Jesus was crucified on April 6th, A.D. 30, the incident occurred during the first days of April). "Now," wrote Christie, "the facts connected with the fig tree are these. Toward the end of March the leaves begin to appear, and in about a week the foliage coating is complete. Coincident with [this], and sometimes even before, there appears quite a crop of small knobs, not the real figs, but a kind of early forerunner. They grown to the size of green almonds, in which condition they are eaten by peasants and others when hungry. When they come to their own indefinite maturity they drop off." These precursors of the true fig are called taqsh  in Palestinian Arabic. Their appearance is a harbinger of the fully formed appearance of the true fig some six weeks later. So, as Mark says, the time for figs had not yet come. But if the leaves appear without any taqsh,  that is a sign that there will be no figs. Since Jesus found "nothing but leaves" - leaves without any taqsh- he knew that "it was an absolutely hopeless, fruitless fig tree" and said as much.<br>  F. F. Bruce goes on to describe the cursing of the fig tree as a real-life parable that emphasized the spoken parable of the fig tree in Luke 13:6-9. It is also likely that Jesus, knowing in advance that his disciples would be surprised by the quick effect his curse had, used the fig tree to provoke their reaction and thus make the lesson about faith more memorable.

It's very important to stay close to the Lord.  It is very hard to do this if we are on our own and not in church, but it depends on the person.  Most who are not in church, as we know, are not walking close to the Lord at all.  We need the fellowship, need to hear the word, need to worship, need to give.  If you don't give at least 10% you are robbing God.  Malachi 3:6-12.  But if you give generously, the Lord will give back to you.  Go and be refreshed in the wind of the Spirit.  Acts 3:19|`|4fTiCNiKaa	The Lord Jesus is longing to have fellowship with you, personally, one-on-one. He is the one whom you need to get right with first. Don't worry about going back to church just yet. Set aside a time that you can talk with the Lord.<br>  <br>  I suggest you find a time (tonight) in which you know no one will bother you. Steal away in a quite place (your bedroom, closet, ect..). Then begin to open your heart to the Lord. Pray and ask Him to cleanse your heart. Let Him know your sorry for turning your back on Him. Don't hold back anything! Here is a suggested prayer you could "model" your after...<br>  <br>  "God, I know that I have sinned and have done things that have hurt You, others and myself. I am a sinner; please forgive my sins. I repent from all my sins, I turn away from my old life, and I ask you to give me the gift of eternal life. Please come into my life and save me from the punishment that I deserve. I put my full trust in what you did for me on the cross, Jesus and I take you as my Savior. Amen."<br>  <br>  Next, I suggest you set a time to speak with your pastor. If not at the church you were attending, then another good, Bible teaching, Spirit-filled church in your area. Ask him for any guidance he may have.<br>  <br>  Next, I suggest you settle yourself into that church. It is vitally important that you do so. A Christian who does not commit to a good, local, Bible preaching, Spirit-filled will be unable to live a victorious Christian life.<br>  <br>  Finally, I suggest you go to this link on our ministry web site that will help you live in victory over sin...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.forministry.com/USOKPENTEMMM1/VictoryOverSin.dsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.forministry.com/USOKPENTEMMM1...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

We all want the same things. <br>  <br>  Bush had two terms and did NOTHING to overturn Roe vs Wade. Why? Because they know making abortion illegal won't do one productive thing. The abortions will continue and people like me will march on Washington right away. Our courts would go broke from all the lawsuits and our jails would be full of decent Americans. The states would be bankrupt in no time and meanwhile, meth dealers and child rapists would still be on the streets. How does that create a better US?<br>  <br>  But Obama has said that while he supports choice 100%, he wants us to do every thing we can to diminish the need for abortions. His plan will work, your empty whining won't. You want to see abortions become a distant memory in the US: Get behind your president and support his policies. We are one country, we want a better life for everyone and if you stop this divisive blubbering, you may live to see your goals come to fruition. How is that a bad thing?<br>  <br>  You know that who people marry is none of your business, right? It isn't your churches either. If you want Christians to have stronger marriages, how about you put your efforts into that goal. After all, you have the highest divorce rate in the US.

And you have just answered your own question and as a Christian you are not supposed to do those things and I apologize onthe behalf of God for the disrespect of your feelings and i hope this answers your question. Oh if you can believethat God exists you may inquire of him for salvation, throug these steps, 1. Repent, 2. Be Baptized with the water in the name o Jesus Christ(not the Father, Son , and Holy Ghost) 'there is no other name given among men by which we must be saved," 3. Be Batized in the Holy Spirit ( With the evidence of Speaking in Tongues). He'll give it to you if you just ask you do not have to tarry. All of this can be accomplished in one of the Following types of churhces- Assemblies Of God, United Pentecostal Church, Pentecostal Assemblies of The World -of which i Am apart-and lastly I believe Pentecostal Holiness Church. Do not believe that we are "crazy" we are not we express our love to God as many Christians do but with a twist-WE speak in tongues as the Spirit of God gives utterance.Acts 2:38 Now if you do not you may come to find soon that people have just disappeared off the face of the Earth, but it is imperative that you do what i advised you to be one of those that go back with God to escape the tribulation period on this Earth.

APqwVYcNaa	There are differences in beliefs beacuse the church has split. Long story but...<br>  Originally when Jesus told Peter (the first Pope) to start 'his' church there was, well, one church, The Catholic Church. Eventually, over time the Catholic Church had a Schism. (can't remember the date). But this was when the Catholic Church split into two; the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church. This was due to slight differences in beliefs and other factors.<br>  <br>  The Catholic Church then continued but eventually split again. This time into the Catholic Church and Protestant Churches. <br>  <br>  Notice that Protestant contains the word Protest? This was because the Protestant churches did not believe in some of the Catholic Churches teachings and beliefs. <br>  One major Protestant leader was Martin Luther. He was a monk who nailed a 94 point Thesis to a church door with stuff that he didn't like about the Catholic Church. <br>  <br>  Then the Catholic Church has continued along without any more splits to date. However, the Protestant Church has split into smaller 'churches' eg. Lutheran, Pentecostal etc. But they are collectively known as the Protestant Church. The Orthodox Church also split (to my knowledge) into smaller 'churches' eg. Greek, Russain etc. (But both of these happened pretty much alongside the Schism and second split)<br>  <br>  Hope this helped and wasn't too complicated.|`|VsC5aZNoaa	well the bible was written in a language that doesn't have the exact same words as most others.. this left some room for debate. as well as some of the writing drifting between literal and vague.

Inside they found limb bones, pelvis, ribs, and a skull cap. The bones were examined by both scientists and evolutionists, and for a number of years all agreed that these were normal human beings. Even that ardent evolutionist and defender of *Darwin, *Thomas H. Huxley, said they belonged to people and did not prove evolution. *Rudolph Virchow, a German anatomist, said the bones were those of modern men afflicted with rickets and arthritis. Many scientists today recognize that they had bowed legs due to rickets, caused by a lack of sunlight.<br>  <br>  In 1886, two similar skulls were found at Spy, Belgium. In the early 1900s, a number of similar specimens were found in southern France. Over a hundred specimens are now in collections.<br>  <br>  A French paleontologist named *Marcellin Boule said they belonged to ape-like creatures, but he was severely criticized for this even by other evolutionists who said this fossil was just modern man (Homo sapiens), deformed by arthritis.<br>  <br>  A most excellent, detailed analysis of how rickets and arthritis caused the features, peculiar to Neanderthals, was written by Ivanhoe in a 1970 issue of the scientific journal, Nature. The article is entitled, "Was Virchow Right About Neanderthal?"<br>  <br>  "Neanderthal man may have looked like he did, not because he was closely related to the great apes, but because he had rickets, an article in the British publication Nature suggests. The diet of Neanderthal man was definitely lacking in Vitamin D."—*"Neanderthals had Rickets," in Science Digest, February 1971, p. 35.<br>  <br>  Neanderthal features include a somewhat larger brow ridge (the supra orbital torus), but it is known that arthritis can make this more prominent. Virchow noted that the thighbone (femur) was curved, a condition common to rickets. Lack of Vitamin D causes osteomalacia and rickets, producing a subtle facial change by increasing the size of the eye cavity (orbit), especially vertically.<br>  <br>  *D.J.M. Wright, in 1973, showed that congenital syphilis could also have caused the kind of bone deformities found in Neanderthal specimens.<br>  <br>  The Neanderthals apparently lived at a time when there was not as much sunlight. We know that the ice age came as a result of worldwide volcanic dust pollution. The weather in Europe at that time was cold enough that they may have stayed so much in their caves that they did not obtain enough sunlight, especially due to the overcast sky conditions.<br>  <br>  They may also have lived longer than men do today. Biblical records indicate that those living just after the Flood (on down to Abraham and even Moses) had somewhat longer life spans than we do today. In 1973, *H. Israel explained that certain living individuals today begin to develop Neanderthaloid features—the heavy eyebrow ridges, elongated cranial vault, and so on—with extreme age. There is definite evidence that the Neanderthals were several hundred years old.<br>  <br>  For much more information, see the book, Buried Alive, by Jack Cuozzo (1998). In it, he clearly shows that the Neanderthals were several hundred years old. Facial bones keep growing throughout life. He also discovered that the evolutionists had mismatched the upper and lower jaw, in order to make the Neanderthals look like apes.<br>  <br>  Here are two facts you will not find in the textbooks: (1) In 1908 a typical Neanderthal skeleton was found in Poland. It had been buried in a suit of chain armor that was not yet fully rusted ("Neanderthal in Armour," in *Nature, April 23, 1908, p. 587). (2) A Neanderthal skeleton was found in the Philippine Islands in 1910. Due to the extreme moisture of that land, it would be impossible for the skeleton to be as much as a century old ("Living Neanderthal Man," in *Nature, December 8, 1910, p. 176).|`|WQvqLnnhaa	No...

They feel that their's is the only "true" religion and are especially upset that people who practice the same religion that Jesus was born into continue with the same religion that Jesus was born into instead of following Jesus.  Despite efforts to destroy Judaism over the past 2,000 years by either killing or converting its followers, we persist.  Looking at their failures over the centuries, a new tactic emerged within the last 100 years or so but has only recently gained attention and acceptance by many Christians--the "messianic Jewish" concept that says Jews can accept Jesus and still remain Jewish.  That is, of course absurd.  However, if it serves the purpose of turning Jews into Christians (even though they call themselves Jews) they don't care about the deceit.  But what they did not expect is that the vast majority of the so-called "messianic Jews" were never Jews to begin with.  But that is OK with them because as the numbers of 'messianic Jews" grows they feel it will help draw more young and naive Jews into becoming Christians without realizing it.<br>  <br>  No Jew on earth accepts a "messianic Jew" as a real Jew.|`|bTQ1c6tKaa	I was going to give a answer, however there is NO question here, of course they say that cause they see a Jew that believes as the early disciples of their Jesus! Which were Jewish also, but more slanderous lies, and ranting, and misinformation made by pagens and reform jews will be post here to drowned out truth! So I will address that. First you don't know what or who Jewish believers of Yeshua believe cause all they talk about is the christian group jews for jesus. You have the right to your opinion however that is all it is is your opinion! You do not speak for all Jewish people, as it has been proved... Now there is even a Sephardic Messianic Jewish Community formed by Sephardic Rabbi Haim Levi!! And there is Reform Rabbi Dan Cohn-Sherbok, a Professor of Jewish Theology at the University of Wales, Rabbi Lampeter disagrees with all your statements, even to the point of saying that real Messianic Jews are not Jewish, then you have from the 1800s to mid 1900s mainly people like Rabbi Sabbati Rohold, an Orthodox Jew born in Israel, Rabbi Mark Levy, an English Jew, Rabbi Jon Zacker, a Russian Jew, Rabbi Beni Abraham are the well known names that carried the Jewish movement called the "Followers of the Way" now the Messianic Torah Observant Jews and they are not part of christianity what so ever, they are the modern day Followers of the Way that even was comprised of Torah Observant Jews, who were the disciples of Yeshua, Kefa, Matit'yah, Yochanan who started the movement that was a sect of Judaism, and even the Talmud confims this, and then you now have the 2nd Jerusalem Council the same as the 1st Jerusalem Council lead by the Jew Ya'akov is being form as we speak in Israel in Jerusalem! You have been proved wrong time and time again, The Messianic Torah Observant Jews do not engage in converting anyone, as it serves no purpose because you can not convert that which is already chosen by G-d, they do not claim Yeshua to be G-d for as their Yeshua said there is but one G-d! Also they can trace their roots back to the "Followers of the Way" and the "Notzrim" that were in fact part of Judaism in every way and counted in the minyan according to Jewish Law!! Deal with it the Talmud, Jewish History and Roman history proves it! There was no Baptist following Yeshua, jews for jesus are not Jewish at all! but those making posts and answers seem like they are giving facts about those Jews who are born Jewish and choose to accept Yeshua as the Jewish Messiah, though I do not agree with them, I don't see any of them up in arms over the Chabad Messianics, yet they are still considered Jewish when they are not if the Messianic Jew is not also! Thats like saying a Reform and a Reform convert are Jewish according to the Orthodox community and they wont even count your convert members as Jewish even in Israel, yet they will claim to speak for all jews thats funny cause the Orthodox have no real respect for the reform movement even today, Because it was not to long ago that the Reform Movement rejected ritual and ceremonial Jewish laws, such as kashrut, which reformers questioned as unnecessary or outdated for a religion based on reason, The traditional Hebrew prayer book (the Siddur) was replaced, Patrilineal descent is accepted by Reform when all other Jewish Movements disagree! Reform Synagogues began to be called Temples, a term reserved in Judaism for the one Temple in Jerusalem! Reform Jews argued that the Mishna and Talmud often contradicts the literal meaning of the Torah, and that these Rabbinic texts also contained outdated ritual practices and values that were contrary to Enlightenment ideals of reason. So you want us to consider YOUR facts about Judaism as facts at the very least one could say reform Judaism is close to the line of being heretics!! I mean look at what Orthodox Jews have often argued on behalf of Jewish traditions making claims, that Reformers are creating a meaningless Jewish identity that encouraged assimilation and fail to nurture the Jewish spirit. They accused Reformers of dishonoring Torah, and even G-d in their pursuit of the modern. Now that being said I would say one can not define all Reform Judaism as the same just because one group says one thing and another says something else, which is what YOU do to Messianic Jews so therefore if you dont want everyone to do that to you, then don't do it to them otherwise we must conclude that Reform Jews are in HERETICS! and at the least do don't follow the Torah! Anyway the point is there do exist Rabbi's who acknowledge Messianics as Jews and even a very well respected Reform Rabbi in UK at the Univ even says that Torah Messianics are a branch of Judaism as they do NOT claim that the Jew called Yeshua to be a deity, their roots and History proves it, their roots are from the followers of Yeshua, who were members of the Way movement as sect of Judaism

Called "KRST," the "Anointed One." Born of the virgin Isis-Meri on December 25th in a cave / manger, with his birth announced by a star and attended by three wise men. Earthly father named "Seb" (translates to "Joseph.") At age 12 he was a child teacher in the Temple and at 30 he was baptized, having disappeared for 18 years. Osiris was baptized in the river Iarutana -- the river Jordan -- by "Anup the Baptizer," who was beheaded. (Anup translates to John.) He performed miracles, exorcised demons, raised El-Osiris from the dead. Walked on water and was betrayed by Typhon, crucified between two thieves on the 17th day of the month of Athyr. Buried in a tomb from which he arose on the third day (19th Athyr) and was resurrected. His suffering, death, and resurrection celebrated each year by His disciples on the Vernal Equinox -- Easter. Called "The Way, the Truth, the Light," "Messiah," "god's Anointed Son,' the "Son of Man," the "Word made Flesh," the "word of truth."

oPQAPfYXaa	Firstly, try reading a modern English translation; Elizabethan English is simply unnecessarily archaic - like the NASB, or ESV, for example.<br>  Secondly, this passage is speaking about a specific set of circumstances, in a very specific moment of time. At best it is misleading, at worst disingenuous, to apply this circumstance to all people at all times.<br>  <br>  A couple of citations from relevant commentaries put this chapter in context.  For further discussion, follow the link provided below.<br>  <br>  De 23:1-25. Who May and Who May Not Enter into the Congregation.<br>  <br>  1-3. He that is wounded ., shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord-"To enter into the congregation of the Lord" means either admission to public honors and offices in the Church and State of Israel, or, in the case of foreigners, incorporation with that nation by marriage. The rule was that strangers and foreigners, for fear of friendship or marriage connections with them leading the people into idolatry, were not admissible till their conversion to the Jewish faith. But this passage describes certain limitations of the general rule. The following parties were excluded from the full rights and privileges of citizenship: (1) Eunuchs-It was a very ancient practice for parents in the East by various arts to mutilate their children, with a view to training them for service in the houses of the great. (2) Bastards-Such an indelible stigma in both these instances was designed as a discouragement to practices that were disgraceful, but too common from intercourse with foreigners. (3) Ammonites and Moabites-Without provocation they had combined to engage a soothsayer to curse the Israelites; and had further endeavored, by ensnaring them into the guilt and licentious abominations of idolatry, to seduce them from their allegiance to God  (Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary).<br>  <br>  23:1 He that is wounded - A phrase denoting an eunuch. Shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord - Shall not be admitted to honours and offices either in the church or commonwealth of Israel; and so the congregation of the Lord doth not here signify, the body of the people, but the society of the elders or rulers of the people. Add to this, that the Hebrew word, Kahal, generally signifies a congregation or company of men met together; and therefore this cannot so conveniently be meant of all the body of the people, which could never meet in one place, but of the chief rulers, which frequently did so. Nor is it strange that eunuchs are excluded from government, both because such persons are commonly observed to want that courage which is necessary for a governor, because as such persons ordinarily were despicable, so the authority in their hands was likely to be exposed to the same contempt (Wesley's Notes).<br>  <br>  |`|a1Iv39BLaa	Where do you people come from?!? lol What difference does it make if a child is born in or out of wedlock?

Don't slip into the habit of spending just because the debt is no longer there. Become a regular saver and the interest (even though small at the moment) will increase your savings.<br>  <br>  It is not wise to make minimum payments only because you remain in debt for a long time that way. The lenders encourage minimum payments because that keeps you their customer for a long, long time. Once paid off they will offer you another loan so don't be tempted. They don't like to let go of their 'customers' which I call victims.<br>  <br>  Getting out of debt is one of the nicest feeling you could have. It is a great weight lifted from your shoulders.|`|LF4vun1maa	Get rid of your credit card debt first.  The interest you're paying on that debt is far greater than anything you could gain through savings or investment.<br>  <br>  Debt consolidation services exist.<br>  <br>  If one of your credit cards has a decent rate on balance transfers pay off that one first, then transfer the balance from the other cards.  If you do that it is critically important that you completely pay off all debt on that card before you transfer anything, and that you never use the card with the consolidated debt on it again.  Those two mistakes are "how they get you" regarding balance transfers.|`|pqveENjUaa	Not sure why this is in this section, but yeah you should definitely pay off the credit cards. Debt is one of the hardest things to get out of, and allowing the debt to build will just cost even more to pay off. If debt collectors come calling they'll drain your savings account without your permission to get their money anyway. <br>  <br>  Your best bet is to go ahead and pay them off, limit your use of them, and start saving with a clean slate.|`|8Zey1ntAaa	It's a good idea to have money saved to cover 6 months of living expenses.  "Just in case" money.  On the other hand, the credit card debt is costing you much more than any interest you will ever earn on savings.  You'll have to decide your own aversion of risk and go from there.  If you have family that you can fall back on in an emergency, then concentrate on paying off the credit card debt.|`|daf653722b9a000bcaed6ea65b1dc5e6aa	You need to do a bit of both. Pay, about 10 to 15 dollars above the minimum. And then, save about $50 a month, if you can. It doesn't sound like much, but trust me, over a period of 8 to 9 years, that will show up in big earnings.<br>  <br>  And the money you save (the $50) should be off limits. No touchie, no looksie, nothing...|`|NWopkX4baa	You should pay off your credit cards. The money you save will have less interest on what you pay on your cards.|`|f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	Your credit cards likely have an interest rate of 12% - 25% (if lower, I want your cards, if higher, get a new one and balance transfer FAST).<br>  <br>  Your savings right now will be LUCKY to see 2.5%.<br>  <br>  As such, your money will work harder for you if you pay off the credit card debt, and then save like the dickens when you have them paid off.<br>  <br>  Figure out what you can budget to pay on your credit cards if you dumped all but a small weekly allowance on your cards.  Once you have paid them off in full, start saving exactly the same amount.  This way you'll never feel a pinch or get tempted to rebudget (unless, obviously, life events require you to rebudget, job change, new living situation, etc...).|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Wherever the higher % is, is where you should pay.<br>  <br>  If Credit card debt is 20% and you only make 10% on your savings, you LOSE money by putting it in the savings account. You save future money by paying off present (higher %) debt.|`|YyEEAJBkaa	Pay them off, even if it leaves you skint, then cut them up.  Credit card debts have ruined far more of my friends lives than drugs or booze. If meeting your minimum payment is hard then phone up the company and ask to come to an arrangement you can afford.  Don't be shy, every extra day you have a credit card debt is a day off your life.|`|4OjLMQ6Yaa	Contact your cards and see if they will work with you to lower interest rates and/or monthly payments. Then CUT all of your cards, do not use them no matter what. Set a budget to where you pay them off and get something into your savings. Don't go out to eat, don't go to movies, shop for clothes at thrift stores, cut corners everywhere.|`|XxWovDNCaa	Perhaps you should start by asking this question in another forum?<br>  What does this have to do with R&S?|`|WQvqLnnhaa	Pay off the credit debt first... that will enable you to save more money in the long run.|`|mrzeXJ6Eaa	I see a lot of answers to pay off your credit card debt first. That's correct.<br>  <br>  Take your smallest debt. Pay as much as you can to pay that off and make the minimum payment on the others. When it's paid off, apply all you can on the next smallest.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, do not charge anything else!<br>  <br>  Also, try to figure out how to cut expenses. Write down everything you spend for a month. Then, sit down and figure out a budget and figure out where you can cut. Stick to this budget!<br>  <br>  Examples of things you can cut:<br>  Cancel cable - Watch shows on the internet instead or watch TV with an antennae like when I was a kid.<br>  <br>  If you have a land line phone and cell phone, get rid of one until you are out of debt. (We decided to use VoIP for our landline).<br>  <br>  Use fluorescent bulbs. Wash all your clothes in cold water. Turn the thermostat down a couple of degrees and wear a sweater, Use the regular wash on your dishwasher instead of "pots and pans".<br>  <br>  For us, the food bill is a big one. Try not to eat out. Try to buy food on sale. Brown bag your lunch.

Cp., however, Lev_19:18; Deut_6:5. <br>  "Agape and agapao are used in the NT <br>  (a) to describe the attitude of God toward His Son, John_17:26; the human race, generally, John_3:16; Rom_5:8; and to such as believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, particularly, John_14:21; <br>  (b) to convey His will to His children concerning their attitude one toward another, John_13:34, and toward all men, 1_Thess_3:12; 1_Cor_16:14; 2_Pet_1:7; <br>  (c) to express the essential nature of God, 1_John_4:8. <br>  <br>  "Love can be known only from the actions it prompts. God's love is seen in the gift of His Son, 1_John_4:9,10. But obviously this is not the love of complacency, or affection, that is, it was not drawn out by any excellency in its objects, Rom_5:8. It was an exercise of the Divine will in deliberate choice, made without assignable cause save that which lies in the nature of God Himself, Cp. Deut_7:7,8. <br>  <br>  "Love had its perfect expression among men in the Lord Jesus Christ, 2_Cor_5:14; Eph_2:4; Eph_3:19; Eph_5:2; Christian love is the fruit of His Spirit in the Christian, Gal_5:22. <br>  <br>  "Christian love has God for its primary object, and expresses itself first of all in implicit obedience to His commandments, John_14:15,21,23; John_15:10; 1_John_2:5; 1_John_5:3; 2_John_1:6. Self-will, that is, self-pleasing, is the negation of love to God. <br>  <br>  "Christian love, whether exercised toward the brethren, or toward men generally, is not an impulse from the feelings, it does not always run with the natural inclinations, nor does it spend itself only upon those for whom some affinity is discovered. Love seeks the welfare of all, Rom_15:2, and works no ill to any, Rom_13:8-10; love seeks opportunity to do good to 'all men, and especially toward them that are of the household of the faith,' Gal_6:10. See further 1_Cor_13 and Col_3:12-14." [ From Notes on Thessalonians, by Hogg and Vine, p. 105.] <br>  <br>  In respect of agapao as used of God, it expresses the deep and constant "love" and interest of a perfect Being towards entirely unworthy objects, producing and fostering a reverential "love" in them towards the Giver, and a practical "love" towards those who are partakers of the same, and a desire to help others to seek the Giver. See BELOVED. <br>  <br>  <br>  See also : agapao in other topics<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  A2.     Love (Noun and Verb) [Verb] <br>  <br>  phileo is to be distinguished from agapao in this, that phileo more nearly represents "tender affection." The two words are used for the "love" of the Father for the Son, John_3:35 (agapao); John_5:20 (phileo); for the believer, John_14:21 (agapao); John_16:27 (phileo); both, of Christ's "love" for a certain disciple, John_13:23 (agapao); John_20:2 (phileo). Yet the distinction between the two verbs remains, and they are never used indiscriminately in the same passage; if each is used with reference to the same objects, as just mentioned, each word retains its distinctive and essential character. <br>  Phileo is never used in a command to men to "love" God; it is, however, used as a warning in 1Cor. 16;22; agapao is used instead, e.g., Matt_22:37; Luke_10:27; Rom_8:28; 1_Cor_8:3; 1_Pet_1:8; 1_John_4:21. The distinction between the two verbs finds a conspicuous instance in the narrative of John_21:15-17. The context itself indicates that agapao in the first two questions suggests the "love" that values and esteems (cp. Rev_12:11). It is an unselfish "love," ready to serve. The use of phileo in Peter's answers and the Lord's third question, conveys the thought of cherishing the object above all else, of manifesting an affection characterized by constancy, from the motive of the highest veneration. See also Trench, Syn., xii. <br>  <br>  Again, to "love" (phileo) life, from an undue desire to preserve it, forgetful of the real object of living, meets with the Lord's reproof, John_12:25. On the contrary, to "love" life (agapao) as used in 1_Pet_3:10, is to consult the true interests of living. Here the word phileo would be quite inappropriate. <br>  <br>  Note: In Mark_12:38, AV, thelo, "to wish," is translated "love" (RV, "desire"). <br>  <br>  <br>  See also : phileo in other topics<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  B1.     Love (Noun and Verb) [Noun] <br>  <br>  agape the significance of which has been pointed out in connection with agapao, is always rendered "love" in the RV where the AV has "charity," a rendering nowhere used in the RV; in Rom_14:15, where the AV has "charitably," the RV, adhering to the translation of the noun, has "in love." <br>  Note: In the two statements in 1_John_4:8,16, "God is love," both are used to enjoin the exercise of "love" on the part of believers. While the former introduces a declaration of the mode in which God's love has been manifested (1_John_4:9,10), the second introduces a statement of the identification of believers with God in character, and the issue at the Judgment Seat hereafter (1_John_4:17), an identification represented ideally in the sentence "as He is, so are we in this world." <br>  <br>  <br>  See also : agape in other topics<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  B2.     Love (Noun and Verb) [Noun] <br>  <br>  philanthropia denotes, lit., "love for man" (phileo and anthropos, "man"); hence, "kindness," Acts_28:2; in Titus_3:4, "(His) love toward man." Cp. the adverb philanthropos, "humanely, kindly," Acts_27:3. See KINDNESS. <br>  Note: For philarguria, "love of money," 1_Tim_6:10, see MONEY_(love_of).

ZmdIlkpQaa	The societies that spawned the Abrahamic faiths were all intensely Patriarchal (male-dominated).  You hit the nail right on the head!  All religions, after all, refelct the values and world view of the societies which adopt them and grow them.  It should be noted that the greatest growth of the religion of Wicca (which is either very balanced, in terms of gender, or even female dominated, depending on the branch) really happened in the 1960's and 1970's, through today, where gender equality has become more institutionalized.|`|VB3ZK5f9aa	Yes, man created god  and religion in his own image - men who lived in a patriarchal society  and wanted to perpetuate it created a mythos that justified and enforced men having power.  |`|5ab3665dd0c477ad8d7d745ebc949f38aa	Say what?  You never read the Proverbs 31 women have you?   Eve was the first defender of the faith,<br>  The Egyptian midwives the first righteous act of civil disobedience, the daughters of Zelaphehad the first successful legal challenge  and Queen Ester and Ruth both examples of heroic women  and both provide pictures of the coming messiah in different ways.  The woman did most of the talking in the romantic Song of SOloman  and also  Proverbs<br>  <br>  Male headship is Biblically normative  but not necessarily exclusive, see the judge Deborah or Prophetess Huldah.  Not being the highest roles of leadership does not mean not having meaningful roles. Women's roles and gifts are most elevated by Christians. Women have the majority vote in most churches whether they hold office there or not.  Of course women also tend to hold importance offices in church like head of vacation bible school, might be a youth ministry leader, music director etc...  Women like Moses sister Miriam were the first to pick up the tamboreen and sing and dance after the parting of the Red Sea.<br>  <br>  Male leadership is biblical  and different roles not being meaning lesser worth, not in a marriage and not in the church.  I think sometimes God does things that are a stumbling block for the proud,  perhaps submission to a servant role is such a stumbling block for both men and women in different ways.|`|Ub8wrlcTaa	Your last suggestion seems to be about right.  It was a male dominated culture.  <br>  <br>  We know that different cultures have had different gender roles so it is nothing inherent in humanity.  Though biology and the nature of our reproductive systems can explain the difference of gender roles, it doesn't explain the hierarchical system of one being dominant over the other.  <br>  <br>  What can come close to explaining it is that this particular culture WAS hierarchical.  And this culture expanded out of the Levant along with the agriculture.  Agriculture allowed for hierarchy as it establishes classes of people -- workers, bureaucrats, guardians, etc.  For whatever reason, perhaps the males more overtly aggressive personality, the male gender assume the dominant position.  <br>  <br>  Remember, the three Abrahamic religions all came out of the same culture... those earliest of agriculturalists.  <br>  <br>  |`|hiS1I7Y7aa	First of all, you cannot two examples and apply them as a answer because statistically you are wrong. <br>  <br>  It is because the founders of the each individual branch of the faith were in a patriarchal society.

There are many various streams of Christian belief - that span from believing in evolution, through to fundamental creationists and lots of points in between.  The other factor is that belief's are changing.  A few decades ago, you would not have had many christians believing in the big bang.  Many actually thought that dinosaur bones were hidden in the ground by god to test their faith!   Now, many Christians have accepted evolution as congrous with their beliefs, and only a minority still believe the earth is only 6000 years old.<br>  <br>  Now as to the date of the big bang - this is obviously also still in conjecture, though the singularity theory puts it at 13.7 billion years ago.   So if you believe that the bible supports the big bang theory.. then it certainly skips allot of time between Genesis, when the earth was created, to the time of old testament.  Still, Im sure nothing much occured over that 13.799 billion years right? :)|`|eDYXQxA9aa	Please, stop using the bible as if it can verify anything. The bible is a non-scientific work of questionable authenticity requiring extensive interpretation to extract lucid meaning - which depending on your idealogical point of view, isn't often particularly lucid or meaningful. <br>  <br>  Big Bang theory simply elucidates the origins of the universe - if you choose to add a layer of complexity by supposing a supernatural being existing outside of space, time and whatever was around before the big bang by stating your god chose to cause the big bang, that's up to you. It's not provable, it never will be until and unless god shows him/her/itself.
8CcZZBJqaa	Mysticism is the practice of communing with God; it is experience God rather than simply studying. From a Christian perspective, without mysticism, Christian faith is meaningless. <br>  <br>  Prayer is an aspect of mysticism. Mysticism should be connected intrinsically with theology. One without the other produces no results.<br>  <br>  From the Orthodox Christian perspective, the goal of the human person is theosis: becoming like God by His Grace and sharing in His love to the point of union. Christ God became man so that humans may become like God. This is our soteriology and our understanding of the fullness of the Incarnation of Christ. This is the experience true mystics (Orthodox perspective) strive for. We have a long standing tradition of contemplative prayer that dates back to the time of the Apostles in its origin, and is well documented by the 4th century by the Christian monks of the Egyptian and Syrian deserts. I suggest looking up people like St. Anthony of Egypt, St. Pacomios, St. Issac of Nineveh, St. John Climacus and St. Gregory Palamas. For more intense reading look up anything written on Athonite spirituality, which is the tradition of the monks of Mt. Athos.<br>  <br>  If you are more familiar with Western Christian traditions I suggest John of the Cross, a Catholic saint, but an individual who was undoubtedly in touch with God mystically.<br>  <br>  In terms of Islam, I would suggest looking at Sufism. I don't know much about Islamic mysticism, but I do remember one author, Al-Ghazali. I found his "Al-Munqidh min Al-dalal" a most interesting work that parallels several aspects and works of the Christian tradition surprisingly. One in particular was "The Way of a Pilgrim," which was written by an anonymous Russian peasant mystic in the 19th century.<br>  <br>  I hope this is helpful.<br>  <br>  +God Bless|`|ybpUb6HCaa	Islam has a mystical branch of it called Sufism.  It's been around for centuries. You will find that fundamentalist Muslims hate Sufis with a passion, call them all kinds of names, including heretic, and think they should be killed for being heretics and Sufism obliterated. <br>  <br>  Sufism is actually a very beautiful mystical movement. Peace loving, deep spirituality, love of God with peace between all human beings as the result rather than going out and murdering in the name of Allah as the fundamentalist Islamists do. <br>  <br>  Sufis understand that murdering in the name of Allah is nothing more than murder and there are no rewards for it from Allah.  Sufism is very peaceful and loving, they are too busy learning deep spirituality to hate others - in other words Sufis are everything that fundamentalist Islam is not, which is why Sufism is hated so much by them. |`|ccf1272e251d4d10b13ce1fd4ea61bdfaa	There are actually branches of each religion that do practice levels of mysticism.  The Christian subreligion of Catholicism has some elements of "Santeria", that has rituals of mysticism.

God knows your heart.|`|4eLLjTzzaa	I believe your reference is well cited.  Food sacrificed to idols has no implication of evil or uncleanness since an idol has no power.  There is only one God.

4l24upt9aa	I think the number 1 reason for a guy to be shirtless is being on the beach. Sometimes at home, they don't like being shirtless but on the beach, they remove their shirts quickly. I like being shirtless because I can show myself being a real guy. I'm 21 and I go shirtless doing sports, at the beach, at home when summer and sleeping. When I'm shirtless, I wear shorts, underpants, boxers, gym shorts or nothing. <br>  <br>  |`|E2s3bdI0aa	I prefer to be nude, but if I can't, I try to wear as little as possible, so I like to be shirtless as well!

For guys it is cool and more comfortable to be shirtless. I go shirtless at home, after I get back from work and generally do not put on a shirt on until the next morning when I am heading out to work. In addition, I run shirtless as it is a lot more comfortable to exercise shirtless. During the summer, sometimes I would go out to run errands as well.|`|h2yhL47Caa	I always go shirtless at home, at the pool and the beach. I also like to cruise with my shirt off in my Jeep with the top down on a warm summer day too. If I am going running or blading and the weather is warm I leave my shirt at home too. <br>  <br>  Like one of the other answerers, in my teenage years I went shirless for well over a week at a time in summer and nobody seemed to really care. <br>  <br>  I used to do gym class in high school shirtless too a lot since boys were given that option. As a competitive gymnast I practiced shirtless and barefoot every day until I was 18. (I hate wearing a shirt or shoes and socks to this day). <br>  <br>  If you're comfortable doing it - then lose the shirt!<br>  <br>  In my 20's here.|`|c3316a5f71249d75a984bd40fa3e4358aa	Shirtless in shower, In your house.

The worst I got was when I was going for a walk one evening, and a couple of guys were having a go because they thought I might have been a bit 'cold' - it was the middle of summer!!!!<br>  <br>  Some places are a bit more 'uptight' about this sort of thing though.  The only way I can think of to find out in your area is to basically take it off and give it a try.  Perhaps to start with, next time you go to a good mates place, leave your shirt at home and see what their reaction is.|`|8dRBvmJxaa	I like to be shirtless as well.

4S5NnT7aaa	Brian Boru was a 10th century AD King of Ireland, not the Leprechauns.  You can't prove that he never lived, because his life is actually fairly well documented, so he isn't a fictional character.<br>  <br>  Now, stop posting irritating and pointless questions.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|r9s0VyJgaa	Proving a negative is a logical fallacy.  Its impossible to prove that someone never lived; IOW, there is always the possibility that he did live and is therefore a real, historical figure.  <br>  <br>  Therefore it is up to those who believe he DID live to provide positive evidence to prove it.|`|18a5331fc23bba2ade711a68568a2f8faa	The difference IS nobody ever suggested the King of the leprechauns ever existed. And I can prove it. Would they be willing to take a lie detector administered by the courts and face perjury charges if the fail.Honest people will admit they wouldn't. On the other hand people who witnessed the life and death of Jesus were willing to die for what they saw.|`|XAlCd8Ebaa	Not necessarily.

In logic terms, that's if (A), then (B). But you cannot say that if not (A), then not (B) is also true, based on the previous conditional. Therefore, you cannot claim that if you can't prove he lived, then he isn't real.<br>  <br>  Put another way, how do you know the evidence for his existence isn't out there, and you just haven't found it yet? <br>  <br>  And incidentally, um, Brian Boru did exist, and he was not so much king of the leprechauns as the King of Ireland from 1002 until 1014. There's debate about what he did and did not do, but he was an actual historical figure.|`|EKmXACCIaa	Brian Boru WAS real, but he was King of Leinster and Munster in the early 11th century, not the king of the leprechauns!<br>  <br>  But on the point you're trying to make - the scientific method points out that "No evidence is no evidence" therefore you can not prove anything by approaching it from a "well prove they didn't!" perspective as it's illogical.<br>  Sorry|`|KVirP3bsaa	He sounds quite interesting to me, and who knows, maybe he does exist.

Birth defects.|`|qRElKKjXaa	Wow. You've definitely asked an interesting question. <br>  <br>  I think the main difference is that if two men had sex together or two women had sex together there is a zero percent chance a child could ever be conceived, whereas if a brother and sister slept together one could be, and the child would most likely have horrendous birth defects. I remember reading about the stillborn baby Anne Boleyn gave birth to from an incestuous relationship with her brother and the horrific defects. *shudders*<br>  <br>  I'm too concerned about this though because the percentage of people who are attracted to a family member is a fraction of those who are gay.|`|AA10556726	The reason why sex is "wrong" between relatives is because of the genetic problems that can arise with their children.  Other than that, there is no real reason to disallow it, it even has implied support from the Bible (Eden, Flood, Lot, etc...).|`|UQFh92xVaa	Problem: Incest is illegal.<br>  Not problem: Homosexuality is legal.<br>  <br>  That's the difference.|`|jgedIY8taa	While I am a straight guy and not comfortable with certain aspects of male heterosexuality, and am personally repulsed by the thought of incest, "consenting adults" means exactly that to me.  The thing is, I don't consider my moral certitude to be an absolute, because I know we all do things that others find immoral.  These might include things like:<br>  <br>  Use contraceptives.<br>  Even engage in intercourse for any reason other than the explicit act of procreation.<br>  Hunt game animals.<br>  Trap moles in your yard.<br>  Eat meat, even.<br>  Work, shop or play on Sundays.  That one's specifically included in the 10 Commandments, right up there with killing and stealing...how many of us violate it just about every week?<br>  Celebrate birthdays and holidays.<br>  Swear.<br>  Masturbate.<br>  Pre-marital sex.<br>  Vote Democratic.<br>  Vote Republican.<br>  Administer corporeal punishment.<br>  Don't wash after using the bathroom.<br>  Don't pray five times a day.<br>  Pay way too much money to attend professional football games.<br>  Fight as soldiers.<br>  Don't turn the other cheek.<br>  Own guns.<br>  <br>  I mean, the list could go on and on, on activities ranging from the innocuous to the extreme, but the point is, if you don't give "consenting adults" carte blanche to do whatever between them they want, you do run the risk of starting to forbid a wider range of activities on moral grounds that many of us would consider "normal."  This may be urban legend, but I have heard of historical cases where married couples were arrested for engaging in oral sex in the privancy of their own homes.  Legend or not, that might be a situation where someone's moral certitude could preclude an activity many consider to be completly normal within certain limits of privacy.

La miséricorde de Dieu sera évidente pour tous: son plan pour faire le bonheur de l'homme, le rachat de l'humanité pécheresse, les moyens nécessaires accordés à chacun pour se sauver, etc.<br>  La méchanceté des damnés également, leur orgueil, leur aveuglement volontaire pour éviter de devoir changer de vie, le refus des graces que Dieu leur a accordé, le refus des propositions de pardon, l'entêtement dans le péché.<br>  La justice de Dieu sera louée.<br>  Beaucoup voudraient compter sur la bonté de Dieu pour continuer à l'offenser ici-bas: les pécheurs voudraient vivre toujours pour pouvoir pécher toujours.

Pourquoi le recours à un avocat et à des cours d'appel? En raison de la faculté jamais démentie qu'à l'homme de se tromper. <br>  <br>  Cela explique d'abord la présomption d'innocence: on n'est pas s?r que l'accusé soit le coupable, car notre intelligence et notre perception sont limités. Dit autrement, la plupart du temps on était pas là pour voir le crime... Ensuite l'avocat sert à aider l'accusé à se défendre, toujours dans le cadre du principe "errare humanum est". On peut se planter dans l'interprétation des preuves, il faut donc un professionnel pour assurer les droits de l'accusé. Enfin, les cours d'appel permettent de revenir sur une éventuelle erreur judiciaire.<br>  <br>  Notre système juridique fonctionne donc sur un principe: lutter contre l'erreur judiciaire.<br>  <br>  Maintenant dans le cadre divin, c'est différent: par définition Dieu voit tout, sait tout, entend tout. Y compris tes pensées avant même que tu les formule. Pas d'erreur judiciaire possible: il est omniscient. Donc, pas besoin de l'arsenal juridique humain.<br>  <br>  D'un point de vue chrétien, c'est un peu plus compliqué. Il n'y a pas de "condamnation" au sens où un juge sévère et à barbe blanche vient te jeter dans la fournaise si t'as mal agis. Dans la Bible, à plusieurs reprises, on insiste sur le choix qu'à l'homme de bien ou mal agir. "Choisis la vie", dit Dieu dans l'ancien testament. On pourrait donc dire que l'homme choisit seul de se mettre en enfer... Mais c'est probablement trop simplifier les choses.<br>  <br>  Il faut prendre en compte aussi notre fabuleuse capacité à déconner par rapport aux règles divines. Personne n'est pur de tout péché, hormis Jésus (évidemment). En fait, il est à craindre que la somme de nos péchés, à nous chrétiens lambda, soit parfois égale à celle de nos bonnes actions. Mais par chance, Dieu ne tient pas une "comptabilité" des péchés. Sans quoi, le paradis serait plut?t vide... Le mot essentiel est le Pardon. Dieu, éternellement, est entièrement disposé à pardonner à qui regrette vraiment ses erreurs. Et ce, même sur notre lit de mort.|`|cw1uZmhwaa	ce qui me désole chez toi, c'est que tu ne m'a pas l'air bête mais quand il s'agit d'apporter une critique sur une religion, ce que tu as droit bien s?r, tu te laisse tout de suite emporter, subjectiver par ton coté satanique, ce qui rend tes phrases totalement vide de sens.<br>  <br>  Part tu principe que dieu existe, ok, bon , a partir de là l'affaire est close, Dieu est le meilleur juge, m'omniscient, l'omnipotent à partir de là pas besoin de temoins ou je ne sais quoi, il sait tout, lis dans ton coeur! comment peux tu comparer un jugement divin d'un jugement humain!!<br>  Révises tes fondamentaux...<br>  Oui, à partir du moment que tu compares un jugement divin d'un jugement humain, faut partir du principe que dieu existe, et là l'affaire est bouvlée pour tout ce que j'ai cité précedemment.|`|dae1c65184018bdc6425b4a10ccd4bdbaa	Vous avez souvent des commentaires intéressants.

Amen. Voilà pourquoi Dieu les a livrés à des désirs sexuels honteux, car leurs femelles ont changé l’usage naturel [de leur corps] en celui contre nature?; et pareillement les males aussi ont laissé l’usage naturel de la femelle et se sont enflammés dans leur passion les uns pour les autres, males avec males, faisant ce qui est obscène et recevant en eux-mêmes le plein salaire que méritait leur égarement.<br>  Et comme ils n’ont pas jugé bon de posséder Dieu dans la connaissance exacte, Dieu les a livrés à une mentalité désapprouvée, pour faire des choses qui ne conviennent pas, remplis qu’ils étaient de toute injustice, perversité, convoitise, méchanceté?; étant pleins d’envie, de meurtre, de querelle, de tromperie, de malignité?; étant chuchoteurs, médisants, ha?sseurs de Dieu, insolents, orgueilleux, arrogants, inventeurs de choses mauvaises, désobéissants à l’égard de leurs parents, sans intelligence, manquant à leurs engagements, sans affection naturelle, sans pitié. Quoique ceux-là connaissent très bien le juste décret de Dieu — que ceux qui pratiquent de telles choses méritent la mort —, non seulement ils continuent à les faire, mais encore ils approuvent ceux qui les pratiquent.

Well that's not how the church's prohpet is dictated, they are to be called of God so Brigham Young was called as the next prophet.

First of all, jealousy can erupt between wives, especially if the husband favors one wife over another.

cd2etz5Raa	If God thought that way He would have never put us on Earth in the first place. <br>  We would have been born into Heaven.<br>  <br>  I believe that here on Earth is where we grow. We face trials, go through tough times, and all of that molds us into who we become - whereas if we were born into Heaven we wouldn't learn anything. <br>  <br>  Also, God has a purpose for each and every one of us. Whether someones purpose is to write books, raise children, start a big organization, become a missionary or whatever, that someone still has a set purpose in life, and ending their life before they fulfill whatever it is would be incredibly selfish, and there would just be one more hole which is left empty in the world. A hole that God appointed that person to fill.<br>  <br>  That is my response.<br>  <br>  Take care!!! :)|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	Well first of all it's a rather stupid question.  If you are a Christian and believe in God, you also believe your life is in the hands of God.  God does not want us to murder ourselves.  Our days are appointed, by God, on this earth for the number He has decided and for His purpose.  When God decides my time is up here, He will call me home.|`|vx4QvCosaa	Well the person was wrong. because ,he may think that. but its not true.

Why don't bill kill himself, and prove that the other person is wrong about his beleif.|`|gW0nD5cEaa	Basically, if you kill yourself you are committing murder, of yourself. Catholics and some others would believe the person would not go to heaven, unless before they died they could repent. Even if this is not how you believe, most Christians believe taking your own life is not the way to get to heaven because a Christian wants to LIVE their life for God, and knows they will get to heaven when God says. <br>  <br>  I kind of like Bill Maher from what I've seen of him, but would often disagree with him. He has a right to his views on or against religion, but he does say things to stir things up, regardless. <br>  He may have 'stumbled' because even from Bill Maher, that might not have been an expected question. <br>  <br>  Yes, most Christians believe when they die they will go to a better place, but we are in this place until God says our time is up.|`|WwCBomTMaa	I only agree that it is a sin to commit suicide.

Paul said, "For me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain."  Meaning that God has given us life and there is a big reason for that.  We are to spend our lives doing what God wants us to do, and as people who live in Christ's love, enjoy this wonderful world.  We know that something far better awaits us, but as long as we have the gift of life, we will use it for the glory of God.  To deliberately end our lives means we usurp God's authority, take life, and decide there is no reason we were born.|`|e51d513ea5bf8209f78025130c42d6a8aa	Well, I am a Christian but I don't agree with "no matter what he does in life when he dies he will be with God"<br>  <br>  However, I do believe I can answer the question because I do believe if I were to commit suicide that I would be with God. <br>  <br>  I will not commit sucide because I know that God has plans for me on this earth and needs me hear as his servant and vessel that he can use to fulfill his will for his glory.|`|BHRHf367aa	I believe like Lazarus when we die we do not go to heaven or hell (see John 11) the body, soul and spirit sleeps(Ecclesiastes 9:5) therefore being "absent from the body"-at death is not to be present with the Lord, it means self is crucified (Gal. 2:20). But death is a sleep. Now, as a Christian my response is: I cannot do anything I want and expect God to take me into heaven, He will not clear the guilty (Ex.34:7), suicide will kill me, but I will not be in heaven, I'll be body, soul and spirit, in the grave. If Lazarus went to heaven when he died.Jesus would have told Mary and Martha so, but He called him from the grave, not out of heaven. come forth, not come down and get back in your body. Can you imagine the sadness people in heaven would feel looking at their loved ones here. We don't go to heaven when we die, and we certainly will not get their no matter what do in this life.|`|AA10332151	When my life is over God will call me home.

Sono spiritualista. Credo nella reincarnazione, nella vita dopo la morte, nei principi di cui parla Allan Kardec.<br>  Secondo lui, e il Libro degli Spiriti, non esiste un "paradiso", come si parla nella Chiesa (nè tanto meno l' inferno!) Esiste si un universo parallelo, dove andiamo quando usciamo dal nostro corpo di carne. <br>  Secondo lo spiritualismo, noi siamo venuti sulla Terra per migliorare, per diventare sempre più simili a Dio. Le continue incarnazioni servono proprio a questo. Reincarniamo sempre su nostra richiesta, e dobbiamo interagire con le persone che sono in qualche modo importanti per noi. Quindi, la nostra anima è abbastanza vecchia.... ovviamente si continua a invecchiare sempre, anche quando non sei in carne, ma nel piano astrale puoi assumere la forma che preferisci, per questo la maggior parte delle "storie di fantasmi" che si sente il fantasma è sempre uguale a quando era in vita. Ho letto diversi libri su racconti della vita dopo la morte scritte da scrittori che usano la psicografia (sono medium che hanno la capacità di cedere il proprio corpo finché uno spirito possa scrivere tramite lui)<br>  Purtroppo qui in Italia si parla pochissimo su questo argomento ed esiste tanta ignoranza a rispetto. Io sono brasiliana e in Brasile esistono centri per studi e aiuti a livello spirituali (sapessi quante malattie sono derivanti solo dei problemi dell'anima! La depressione, ad esempio, molte volte è solo un disturbo spirituale!) <br>  Vorrei poterti consigliare qualcosa da leggere, ma non saprei indicarti niente in italiano. So però che Il libro degli spiriti di Allan Kardec è stato tradotto anche al italiano. Prova dare uno sguardo sulla Feltrinelli (lì ho già visto che c'è)...<br>  Ma non ho capito: tua sorella è deceduta?

Egli conosce la verità, e nella sua Parola, la Bibbia, spiega qual è la condizione dei morti. L’insegnamento biblico è chiaro: quando moriamo cessiamo di esistere. La morte è il contrario della vita. I morti non vedono, non sentono e non pensano. Non c’è una parte di noi che sopravvive alla morte del corpo. Infatti il saggio re Salomone disse: "Poiché i viventi sono consci che moriranno; ma in quanto ai morti, non sono consci di nulla, né hanno più alcun salario, perché il ricordo d’essi è stato dimenticato.(...) Tutto ciò che la tua mano trova da fare, fallo con la tua medesima potenza, poiché non c’è lavoro né disegno né conoscenza né sapienza nello Sceol (la comune tomba del genere umano), il luogo al quale vai."(Ecclesiaste 9:5,10) Sullo stesso piano il salmista dice: "Il suo spirito se ne esce, egli torna al suo suolo; In quel giorno periscono in effetti i suoi pensieri."(Salmo 146:4)<br>  Anche Gesù parlò della morte, paragonandola ad un "sonno profondo senza sogni". <br>  La Bibbia ci assicura inoltre che i nostri cari che sono morti torneranno in vita con la prospettiva di non morire più, in effetti ci sarà una risurrezione come dice Atti 24:15 e come Gesù stesso disse: "Non vi meravigliate di questo, perché l’ora viene in cui tutti quelli che sono nelle tombe commemorative udranno la sua voce e ne verranno fuori, quelli che hanno fatto cose buone a una risurrezione di vita, quelli che hanno praticato cose vili a una risurrezione di giudizio. "(Giovanni 5:28,29)<br>  Ti sembrerà strano ma secondo la Bibbia nel giorno del giudizio di Dio tua sorella sarà riportata in vita all'età in cui era, in modo che i suoi cari la possano riconoscere e poi crescerà fino all'età matura e resterà così per l'eternità e come dice anche Giobbe 33:25: "La sua carne divenga più fresca che nella giovinezza; Torni egli ai giorni del suo vigore giovanile’." perchè avrà la perfezione.<br>  <br>  Tieni presente che la risurrezione non è ancora iniziata ma quando avverrà anche noi potremmo vivere con i ns cari in giuste condizioni qui sulla terra.<br>  <br>  Spero di esseti stata di aiuto.....<br>  <br>  Ciao|`|alvhFq7Yaa	l'anima in paradiso non ha sesso ed eta'|`|gluRCqTtaa	Nella bibbia, non ci sono molte indicazione su come si starà nel paradiso. Una indicazione ci viene dal vangelo di luca:<br>  <br>  Luca 23,46: Gesù, gridando a gran voce, disse: "Padre, nelle tue mani consegno il mio spirito". Detto questo spirò. <br>  <br>  Che sta ad indicare che è solo lo spirito quello che assurge al paradiso. Quindi è poco importante l'età e la crescita poichè lo spirito è immutabile.<br>  <br>  Ricorda sempre che la parola di dio non è comprensibile a tutti, ma da tutti può essere compresa.<br>  Le risposte che cerchi le devi trovare leggendo la parola, attendendo che essa ti sveli la verità.<br>  <br>  Come in <br>  Matteo 13<br>  Il regno dei cieli si può paragonare a un uomo che ha seminato del buon seme nel suo campo. <br>  <br>  [25] Ma mentre tutti dormivano venne il suo nemico, seminò zizzania in mezzo al grano e se ne andò. <br>  <br>  [26] Quando poi la messe fiorì e fece frutto, ecco apparve anche la zizzania. <br>  <br>  [27] Allora i servi andarono dal padrone di casa e gli dissero: Padrone, non hai seminato del buon seme nel tuo campo? Da dove viene dunque la zizzania? <br>  <br>  [28] Ed egli rispose loro: Un nemico ha fatto questo. E i servi gli dissero: Vuoi dunque che andiamo a raccoglierla? <br>  <br>  [29] No, rispose, perché non succeda che, cogliendo la zizzania, con essa sradichiate anche il grano. <br>  <br>  [30] Lasciate che l'una e l'altro crescano insieme fino alla mietitura e al momento della mietitura dirò ai mietitori: Cogliete prima la zizzania e legatela in fastelli per bruciarla; il grano invece riponetelo nel mio granaio". <br>  <br>  [31] Un'altra parabola espose loro: "Il regno dei cieli si può paragonare a un granellino di senapa, che un uomo prende e semina nel suo campo. <br>  <br>  [32] Esso è il più piccolo di tutti i semi ma, una volta cresciuto, è più grande degli altri legumi e diventa un albero, tanto che vengono gli uccelli del cielo e si annidano fra i suoi rami". <br>  <br>  [33] Un'altra parabola disse loro: "Il regno dei cieli si può paragonare al lievito, che una donna ha preso e impastato con tre misure di farina perché tutta si fermenti".|`|ouRZFXoDaa	Premetto che non sono Cattolico, ma vengo da un educazione Evangelica, ma volevo far notare che è si vero che in PARADISO siamo degli Spiriti ed in quanto tali...senza ne età e ne sesso...ma è anche vero che dopo la battaglia finale..quella descritta nell'Apocalisse..noi riprenderemo possesso dei nostri corpi.<br>  Com'è scritto nella Sacre Scritture...e da dove nasce il divieto della chiesa cattolica alla CREMAZIONE.<br>  Comunque secondo quanto ne sò io...e soprattutto a quanto piace credere a me....noi saremmo tutti giovani...e i nostri corpi anche se quando eravamo in vita erano malati...saranno guariti.<br>  C'è uno studio che parla che la VIA CRUCIS fatta da Gesù sia stata fatta proprio per riprendere su di sè tutte le nostre malattie in modo che quando verrà la RESURREZIONE dei nostri corpi questi siano sanati.<br>  "egli ha portato i nostri peccati nel suo corpo, sul legno della croce, affinché, morti al peccato, vivessimo per la giustizia, e mediante le sue lividure siete stati guariti."<br>  Pietro 2:24<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Hey Job se leggevi bene...c'era scritto che è uno dei dictat della chiesa Cattolica e che io non sono Cattolico.<br>  Anche secondo me....veremmo giudicati secondo il nostro comportamente.<br>  Mi spiego...c'è chi DIO lo chiama DIO...e c'è chi lo chiama in altri modi.<br>  Ma come poter pensare che gente come giustamente dici te tipo gli INDU i BUDDHISTI non vengano resuscitati soltanto perchè hanno bruciato i loro colpi.<br>  L'immensità di DIO è proprio il PERDONO.<br>  E questi suoi figlio saranno con noi in PARADISO.<br>  Almeno secondo il CREDO che ho io !!<br>  Figurati..secondo me ci andranno anche alcuni ATEI...che hanno passato la loro vita al servizio dei Bisognosi !!<br>  Chiunque vive nell'AMORE secondo me merita di essere SALVATO !!

I know that sounds harsh, but I am telling you that sometimes these precious ones will go home to be with their Lord, and sometimes they are miraculously healed.<br>  <br>  This happened to my brother.  He had a serious chronic illness that would have taken him at age 5.  My mother was very religious and a real prayer warrior.  We ended up  having a wonderful childhood.<br>  <br>  Over the years, time and again he was miraculously saved from death in numerous circumstances.  <br>  <br>  A few examples:<br>  <br>  Once he passed out in his car while driving.  Instead of crashing into oncoming traffic or the trees which lined the side of the road, his little VW slipped between the trees and harmlessly drifted across an abandoned field until it came to a safe stop.<br>  <br>  Once he was in a coma and a dog dragged its' owners to his bedside to alert them.  He was in severe insulin shock and was saved just in time.<br>  <br>  Once we were told he would be dead by morning because of organ failure, and the next morning, the doctors were stunned because his kidneys were suddenly healed.  They even wrote on the chart that it was an unexplainable miracle.  Years later, my brother told me that he saw two angels in his room that night and this was before he was a believer.<br>  <br>  These things kept happening as he got sick time and again.  We kept praying for healing.  Finally, during the last 7 years of his life, he came to know the Lord and had such happiness and peace.  <br>  <br>  In the end, he contracted a completely different disease (cancer) but by then, he was thinking he would be happy to be healed and stay, or happy to go on to heaven where he would get his sight back and his ability to walk and run.  Do you know, he even joked that only he would contract cancer on top of everything else, and he wondered what heaven would be like and hoped he could have a tree house.  He said he had thousands of questions, but wondered if he would even need to ask them, or if he would just know.<br>  <br>  He told us that if he was able, he would try to communicate what it was like just before passing over.  <br>  <br>  The last day on earth he was having difficulty breathing and needed constant oxygen.  He was surrounded by his parents and sisters.  He was completely out of it and uncommunicative.  But then, he took the oxygen mask off and said, that's enough.  I'm ready.  At that point he was breathing quite easily and was rested.  At the moment of death, he clearly rang out "Perfect Knowledge, Perfect Joy."<br>  <br>  I still miss his silly and quirky ways, but I know he is happy.  But somehow his going was joyful.  You see, God gave him 50 years on this earth because he wasn't ready to go, but at the point he was ready, He took him home.<br>  <br>  I will pray for your daughter and for you.  God bless you.|`|aogwoFKJaa	Oh, sweetie, there is nothing that can prepare you for it. Things are somewhat better now, but I still have some bad nights. Use this year wisely.

AA10472482	1) Is Jesus God? Is praying to him wrong?<br>  <br>  Answer: Jesus is not God the Son, but the Son of God. Compare Luke 1:32 with Psalm 83:18. Also John 3:16 says he is God's Son. Jesus commended Peter for say "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God" in Matthew 16:16.<br>  <br>  Jesus said we are to pray to God. "Our Father who art in heaven...." - Matthew 6:9. We must pray through Jesus.<br>  Note John 15:16 - "... Whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you."<br>  <br>  Also note John 16:23 - "And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you."<br>  <br>  2) Is Jesus a "created" being?....did someone make him?<br>  <br>  Answer: Colossians 1:15 & Revelation 3:14 answer Yes. See also Proverbs 8:22, where Jesus is prefugured as wisdom personified.<br>  <br>  3) Is Jesus the only one of his kind?...or did He have a brother named Lucifer?<br>  <br>  Answer: Jesus is called Jehovah's "only begotten" Son. That indicates uniqueness. No, he did not have a brother named Lucifer.<br>  <br>  4) What is Jesus' role within your belief system?<br>  <br>  Answer: Ransomer, redeemer, savior, teacher, leader, & head. The one through whom Jehovah will accomplish his purpose.<br>  <br>  5) How do you feel about his death, burial and resurrection? .....is believing in His death, resurrection and shedding of blood enough for eternal life...is there more required in your system of beliefs to obtain salvation?<br>  <br>  Answer: Anyone can say they believe. However James 2:19 tells us that "the demons believe and shudder."<br>  Works cannot and will not save; only a living active faith will. Faith without works is dead. (James 2:26) <br>  <br>  If you note the famous faith chapter in the Bible, Hebrews 11, you will note that all those people were declared  righteous by their faith WHICH MOVED THEM TO ACTION.<br>  <br>  It wasn't the works they did, it was the fact they did works because of their faith.<br>  <br>  ADDED: KJV-1971 - Please email me through my profile and we can talk further if you wish, and thanks. I try. And you too seem to be more polite than most who disagree with us.|`|8UTwY1bOaa	yes to them all .....|`|EV2LMaiLaa	damn you got me<br>  <br>  i cant answer that<br>  <br>  you win|`|rVPrhd26aa	Jehovah Witnesses don't use yahoo answers.... it's the devils tool! all the answers on here are from Satan... google answers however is the direct voice of god.|`|c898150558ddb7ef0e50782e0a5d05b4aa	Comment: I proclaim Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  Where John 1:1 and Isaiah 9:6 certainly shows Jesus to be a deity he is not the True God who sent him. <br>  <br>  "And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent."<br>  <br>  Comment: I dont buy God accepting a "created" man for the atonement of sins.....God would require more.<br>  <br>  Perhaps the questioner can give an example of a scripture where God would require more of a ransom for Adam? This answerer can only find the following:<br>  <br>  "For this one man, Adam, brought death to many through his sin. But this other man, Jesus Christ, brought forgiveness to many through God's bountiful gift."<br>  <br>  Comment: God would require more. Furthermore, if jesus was created....then He couldnt resurect himself, nor conquer death.<br>  <br>  God the father of Jesus resurrected him using his Holy Spirit.<br>  <br>  "My call is from Jesus Christ himself and from God the Father, who raised Jesus from the dead."|`|LCZChP7Maa	Jesus is the son of God who came to earth to die for our sins. He was the first of Jehovah's creations - that's why he's called God's only begotten son. Jesus' death makes it possible for righteous individuals to obtain life on a future Paradise earth (Psalms 83:18) However, to gain salvation, we have to exercise faith and keeping doing God's will. Faith requires actions. (James 2:26). If you have more questions, talk to a JW the next time they knock on your door.|`|mXwO9xmCaa	1) No... Psalms 83:18..

5syj6Uzaaa	Some may.  Similarly, many parents do the same and so fail to prepare their children for responsible adulthood.  The crucial difference between parents/church and the government is the source of the funds.  Generally speaking, the funds obtained by a family or church must be obtained voluntarily.  As a rule, government obtains its funds through taxation.  If you will, government claims a near total ownership of all wealth in society.  Its claim is only constrained by the extent to which we might revolt against taxes.<br>  <br>  So churches, parents and other voluntary institutions are just as susceptible to errors in welfare as is government.  But government stands alone in its capacity to magnify its errors through total claims on society.

Being BORN AGAIN is only for those who qualify by obedience to be judges with Christ.   God chose  a " little flock" (Luke 12:32) of these human judges  numbering 144000 ( Rev 14:3)who will reign with Christ for the thousand years.

He was translated (taken by God) to Heaven -- he did not ascend.  To "ascend" implies that you do so under your own power.  The same applies to Elijah.  He was visibly translated to Heaven in what looked like, to Elisha, to be a chariot of fire.  At the end of time, the 144,000 will also be translated to Heaven without having seen Death.<br>  <br>  ????????The New Testament makes the distinction that Jesus Christ was the first to ascend (under His own Power) to Heaven, because many religions had claimed (and have claimed) that their prophets or leaders achieved such a state of perfection (or nirvana) that they were able to take themselves to a higher plane of existence (or some such) -- "Heaven," if you will.

(Genesis 6:11 RSV).<br>  Out-of-control human violence was the reason that God later brought the flood upon humanity:<br>  <br>  <br>  "And God said to Noah, "I have determined to make an end of all flesh; for the earth is filled with violence through them; behold, I will destroy them with the earth." (Genesis 6:13 RSV)<br>  Enoch was a very good and righteous man who was living in a very dangerous, extremely violent world. God took righteous Enoch away, not so that he wouldn't ever see death, but so that, according to the Scriptures, "he was not found" by the evil, extremely violent people who would have murdered such a faithful man. He was taken to a place of safety, on this earth (i.e. many centuries later, Jesus Christ authoritatively stated "No one has ascended into heaven but He who descended from heaven, the Son of man" John 3:13 RSV), where he would have lived out the remainder of his life before dying a natural death just like every other human.|`|6lJuKKMHaa	Enoch did not die like some of your 'answerer's' are saying.

tGUPNrE0aa	In the four Gospels, Jesus is recorded as saying: “Blessed are the peace-makers; they will be called sons of God<br>  <br>  The Son of God <br>  Another of the evidences used for Jesus’ divinity is the application of the title “Son of God” to Jesus.  However, there are numerous places in the Old Testament where this title has been given to others. <br>  God called Israel (Prophet Jacob) His “son” when He instructed Prophet Moses to go to Pharaoh in Exodus 4:22-23, “22 And you shall say to Pharaoh, ‘Thus says the Lord, “Israel is my first-born son, 23and I say to you, ‘Let my son go that he may serve me.’ ”  [5] <br>  In 2nd Samuel 8:13-14, God calls Prophet Solomon His son, “13 He [Solomon] shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever. 14I will be his father, and he shall be my son.” <br>  God promised to make Prophet David His son in Psalms 89:26-27: “26 He shall cry unto me, ‘Thou art my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation,’ 27Also I will make him my first-born, higher than the kings of the earth.” [6] <br>  Angels are referred to as “sons of God” in The Book of Job 1:6, “Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came among them.” [7] <br>  In the New Testament, there are many references to “sons of God” other than Jesus.  For example, when the author of the Gospel according to Luke listed Jesus’ ancestors back to Adam, he wrote: “The son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.” [8] <br>  Some claim that what is unique in the case of Jesus, is that he is the only begotten [9] Son of God, while the others are merely “sons of God”. However, God is recorded as saying to Prophet David, in Psalms 2:7, “I will tell the decree of the Lord: He said to me, ‘You are my son, today I have begotten you.’ ” <br>  It should also be noted that nowhere in the Gospels does Jesus actually call himself “Son of God”. [10]  Instead, he is recorded to have repeatedly called himself “Son of man” (e.g. Luke 9:22) innumerable times. And in Luke 4:41, he actually rejected being called “Son of God”: “And demons also came out of many, crying, ‘You are the Son of God!’   But he rebuked them, and would not allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.” <br>  <br>  Since the Hebrews believed that God is One, and had neither wife nor children in any literal sense, it is obvious that the expression “son of God” merely meant to them “Servant of God”; one who, because of his faithful service, was close and dear to God, as a son is to a father. Christians who came from a Greek or Roman background, later misused this term. In their heritage, “son of God” signified an incarnation of a god or someone born of a physical union between male and female gods. [11] When the Church cast aside its Hebrew foundations, it adopted the pagan concept of “son of God”, which was entirely different from the Hebrew usage. [12]<br>  Consequently, the use of the term “son of God” should only be understood from the Semitic symbolic sense of a “servant of God”, and not in the pagan sense of a literal offspring of God. In the four Gospels, Jesus is recorded as saying: “Blessed are the peace-makers; they will be called sons of God.” [13] <br>  Likewise, Jesus’ use of the term abba, “dear father”, should be understood similarly. There is a dispute among New Testament scholars as to precisely what abba meant in Jesus’ time and also as to how widely it was in use by other Jewish sects of that era.  <br>  James Barr has recently argued forcefully that it did not have the specially intimate sense that has so often been attributed to it, but that it simply meant “father”. [14] To think of God as “our heavenly Father” was by no means new, for in the Lord’s prayer he is reported to have taught his disciples to address God in this same familiar way.|`|2de0b79e82da7f529f88b7bd06230c4faa	  - There's - Adam, Jesus the Christ, & Everybody who has received their Spiritual Birth by asking Jesus into their Life & Hearts  Yo  ! ! ! . . . |`|dPjKti1Caa	When we are saved we become son's of God.

For instance, there is a verse that says women need to have their head covered when they go in to worship, yet we don't see all women in church wearing bonnets, do we?  It's because back then for a woman to have her head uncovered was considered promiscuous (prostitutes didn't cover their head).  The modern day interpretation would be - don't wear revealing clothing to church.  Paul also said women should learn quietly, which sounds horrible to us.  But back in those days, women weren't even allowed to be educated.  So, what they would have heard in that day and age is - women can learn!  Back in Paul's day it was disrespectful for women to speak out of turn or in public, and that's where that comes from.

I can answer this question! I am open-minded, slightly intelligent and tolerant. HOWEVER, this is a free country (and world as far as I'm concerned). When the religious interfere in my life here on my planet, I stand up and say STOP THAT! But, they don't! Some examples (and some of them don't happen anymore):<br>  <br>  All stores and businesses have to be closed on Sunday (Sat. for our Jewish friends).<br>  <br>  I can't get an abortion because it is against the law.<br>  <br>  I can't get married to my boyfriend because we're two men.<br>  <br>  You can't buy liquor on a Sunday, and some times and in some places in the U.S. you can't buy it (or manfacture it) at all!<br>  <br>  When I go to a banquet that is supposedly secular, I have to pray with people before I can dig in. (I generally pray that we will eat soon).<br>  <br>  People telling me what to do and how to do it that should just mind their own darn business!<br>  <br>  There are many more, hundreds.<br>  <br>  This is why people get upset. There are many laws, customs and other things in this country that are there only because of religious belief! I don't have any religion. Why should I have to conform to someones superstitions? Most of the things are harmless, yes, but not all.<br>  <br>  Since I am fairly tolerant, I generally don't get into verbal brawls with the religious. But, SOMETIMES, you are drawn into a fight by forces you cannot control (your mood, where you are, a cloudy day, you know...) I don't have much tolerance for idiocy, though. You will sometimes see me speak up there, too. But, I usually ignore it and move on to answer a different question. Why punish myself? It's not worth it.<br>  <br>  Of course, this is just ME. I certainly can't control other people's responses or behavior, But, through example, maybe some people will get it. This was a GREAT question! Thank you!<br>  Auntie Kookoo<br>  <br>  Edit: Jared, you rock! Disco, do watch the video for more examples... Sage, are we having a bad day? I don't see much tolerance in your remarks, perhaps it's just me?...

We desperately try to hold on to things - friends, health, material things - that do not last, and this causes sorrow. <br>  <br>  The Buddha did not deny that there are things in life that give joy, but pointed out that none of them last and our attachment to them only causes more suffering. His teachings were focused entirely on this problem and its solution. <br>  <br>  This is done by recognising the impermanence of all things and freeing oneself from attachment to these things. This will lessen suffering and eventually end the cycle of rebirth. These teachings are expressed most concisely in the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path, which together form the foundation of belief for all branches of Buddhism.<br>  |`|3HNeBIOfaa	When we rise above the currents of everyday life and start asking about the origin of life itself - Kabbalah steps in Kabbalah became hidden about 2,000 years ago.

It's outrageous for you to say that. Everyone has the freedom to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness. My happiness is in God, and you can NEVER take that from me.|`|XSEWADI0aa	Evolutionists today use the same Pharisaic approach: ‘Believe as we do,’ they say. ‘All competent scientists believe evolution. All intelligent people believe it. Only the uneducated and the ignorant don’t believe it.’ By such intimidation and mental bullying, masses of people are herded into the evolutionists’ camp. They know nothing of the weaknesses and inadequacies of evolutionary theory or its unsound speculations and hypothesized impossibilities—such as the origin of life from inanimate chemicals. So they are swept along by the repetitious mantras recited by evolution’s propagandizers. The theory becomes dogma, its preachers become arrogant, and dissenters reap disdainful abuse. The tactics work. They did in Jesus’ day; they do today.<br>  <br>  This four-word propaganda line, ‘Evolution is a fact,’ is little (little in content), is a simple sentence (easily said), and is repeated persistently (even 12 times in one short essay). It qualifies as effective brainwashing propaganda, and with repetition it reaches the status of a slogan—and slogans everywhere repeated are soon programmed into brains and tripped off tongues with little critical examination or skeptical dissection. Once a theory has been sloganized into community thinking, it no longer requires proof, and any who dissent are scorned. If such dissenters present rational?refutation?of the slogan’s validity, they are especially irritating and subjected to the only available response, namely, ridicule.<br>  <br>  Evolutionists that specialize in the Big Lie that ‘Evolution is a fact’ also take another leaf out of Hitler’s book, for in it he said of the masses he controlled: “With the primitive simplicity of their minds they will more easily fall victims to a great lie than to a small one, since they themselves perhaps also lie sometimes in little things, but would certainly still be too much ashamed of too great lies.” A book of popular quotations lists this one among them: “If you tell a big enough lie and tell it often enough, many will believe it.” The one evolutionists tell is apparently big enough, and it’s certainly told often enough, for millions believe it.<br>  <br>  It is a lie that is also a fraud because it is “an?act of deceiving or misrepresenting,” an “intentional perversion of truth in order to induce another to part with something of value.” Teaching that man’s ancestors are animals, starting with some microbe and ending with some ape, evolutionists have “exchanged the truth of God for the lie.” By this lie, they induce many to part with something of great value—their faith in God as their Creator.—Romans 1:25.<br>  <br>  This fraud does terrible damage. Its victims feel freed from the Creator’s laws, and they become a law to themselves: ‘No right or wrong. Fulfill all fleshly desires. Do your own thing. No need for any guilt trips.’ Enter the moral breakdown, unrestrained and full-blown. Parted from their Creator and the true values of the Bible, they become spiritually impoverished and end up “like unreasoning animals born naturally to be caught and destroyed.”—2?Peter 2:12.|`|hLQa3VtYaa	I think we ought to stick with freedom of religion.

People are generally afraid of death and seek an explantion for what occurs afterwards. This coins there fear of the unknown. Despite how insidious there claims are they find much comfort in believing that they will transcend unto a metaphysical reality after death. Albeit it may be an eternity of hellfire they find it infinitely less terrifying then not knowing at all. You must also understand that they have a culture of premature force feeding. Rather then allowing one to make the philosophical venture into one's self they inhibit the development with force bible feeding and the culture gyrates around inhibiting the engagement of free thinking. Take the Adam and eve myth. Eve a woman damned all of humanity just because she inquired and ate from the tree of knowledge(seems knowledge is being criminalized). Also some of Christianities greatest blasphemies is using the lord name in vain and an eternity of hellfire for speaking out. It is the fear that stays their rationality. This culture of force feeding is perpetuated by the children.|`|DOQ4bZQuaa	Think a little harder.|`|Z4avhg3eaa	Uh...no.  <br>  <br>  I agree that evolution explains the diversity of life on this planet.

The problem is there are people that would rather follow Satan's suggestions because they are used to doing so and reject what Jesus Christ did for them.  God cannot have no followers of Satan up in heaven, because their would be a war in heaven again.  God is done with that.  He threw Satan and the angels that sided with Satan out of heaven to earth.

m58dbfIGaa	Doesn't sound like a personal attack to me.  Sounds like you are looking out for your step daughter, and asking the MIL to respect your wishes (and her word, for that matter).  <br>  At the very least she owes you an apology for not keeping her word (dropping your daughter off to you). <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, you probably won't get that from her, since she sounds like some of my relatives who have too much pride in their hearts to know what is right.<br>  <br>  I would say if you did what you say you did, and spoke calm and respectful, then you would not owe an apology for telling her to respect her word and your wishes.  Jesus didn't apolgize for telling the pharisees what they were doing wrong, and I don't think putting the blame for her faults on yourself is something that is good for Christians to do.  It encourages us to take the fault for everything, which shouldn't be the case.  We should stand up for what's right, much like you did.|`|VxrsfAfyaa	You are responsible for your step-daughter.

I still wont allow my daughter ro ride around with 18 yrs old boys, but this issue doesnt have to become a major squabble. We just have different ideas on parenting.|`|iZrNlSIJaa	I don't think you should apologize. It sounds to me like your MIL is overstepping her boundaries and is trying to go over your and your husband's heads regarding your daughter. She is *your* daughter, not your MIL's, and your MIL should acknowledge your wishes (and boundaries) regarding who your daughter sees, where she goes, and with whom. I think she is the one who should apologize to you.|`|jN5SXl5Caa	A couple of things. One, I was seen as a good kid when I was his age and I wanted the same thing every guy wants. Booty, Booty, Booty Call, I think I got a Booty call. But on the other hand you seem to be a very good parent who is level headed. Two if this is true I feel that you would have taught here good decision making skills (yes I agree she is 14 and no one makes great decisions at 14), you never know she might surprise you and make the right decisions. Three no one has the right to tell you what to do with your kid and as you said you didn't. If she wants to extrapolate your ideas to her own life that's her problem. Also I do feel she sees that there is something wrong with it, otherwise she would not have been so made and defended it so fiercely. In this situation I do not think Christianity has anything to do with it. But puberty does, if women only knew what 13-20 year old boys think they would be disgusted. It is literally sex 24/7. When I look back now I wonder how I didn't hump everything in sight. She is to young to realize this and that is why she might not have seen this as a problem but your MIL( took me a second to figure that one out) should know better. Christian or not.|`|u0eTvggDaa	Okay yeah i agree with you, your daughter should have called, or texted you and asked if she could go to the movies.<br>  <br>  I don't agree on you just saying that she can't drive around with an 18 year old because your daughter is 14, i myself had A LOT of older friends when i was younger, but i think what should have been done in this situation is that she brought the guy over for you to meet him. That was always a rule with me and my parents, as long as they met the person that i was hanging out with and they had their number everything would be cool, and yeah i had to call and check in and stuff.<br>  <br>  But just because your daughter is "14" you need to have a little more leeway with her as well. or in my opinion.<br>  <br>  and saying sorry to W? i wouldn't that is your daughter and you have the right to tell your daughter to get home whenever you feel like it.<br>  So no i wouldn't apologize for looking after your own daughter.|`|1gA07a1Caa	that what is the bible learn your children and more a lot like these stuff  ...safe your family man with chaste teachings|`|JqtPN2kjaa	Wow, first to some of the responders......If you thought that the asker was long winded, over reacting or whatever you should have found another question to answer. My apologies to the asker for such rude and useless answers. <br>  <br>  Now for my answer, I understand EXACTLY how you feel. First your daughter especially at her age needs to understand the rules and who gives and does not give permission for certain activities. That needs to be instilled in her because your MIL will not be the only one 'allowing' her to participate in things you and your husband would not allow. <br>  Second, the fact that the 18 y/o boy is a 'good Christian boy' does not matter one iota. All Christians are sinners too, and who are we or she to judge if he is good or not? <br>  And last but definetly not least, your MIL owes you an apology. Your daughter is your responsibility and the roles of a parent and a grandparent is very different. It is not your job to judge if what she is doing with her daughter is right or wrong. It is also not her job to judge if what you do with your daughter is right or wrong. But it is your responsility as a Christian to lead by example not judgement. I think she needs to put her pride aside as pride has no place in the kingdom of heaven and respect your position as the mother and apologize to you and your husband for putting your child in danger. <br>  <br>  I have a 15 y/o boy (who thinks he is 20) and a MIL with the same prideful heart, although Christian. My husband and I have made it very clear that we are the ONLY ppl with the authority to give my son permission to go anywhere, with anyone, to do anything. <br>  <br>  Further, I think this is the perfect place/ catagory for your question. Good luck to you<br>  <br>  It should not matter if its your 'step daughter' or not. My son is my step son and that does not matter in my heart. Your desire to be a good parent are even more admirable because you are doing it because you want to not because you have to.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	no she needed permission....<br>  why is this here in relig?????????|`|dDMOJWxwaa	This is like my second daughter.

I use mainly the NIV and the NASB.<br>  <br>  But which one SHOULD you use or which is BEST?  <br>  <br>  Well it depends....let me explain. <br>  <br>  There are two major types of translations:<br>  <br>  1. Word for Word: That is the best equivalent ENGLISH WORD for the Original GREEK or HEBREW Word.<br>  <br>  2. Dynamic Equivalent: That is the best equivalent ENGLISH PHRASE for the Original GREEK or HEBREW phrase.<br>  <br>  Both methodologies of translation are very good and can be very accurate. The reality is most translations will involve a litte bit of both of these methods.<br>  <br>  Also its important to have a modern committee translation. That is a translation that has been published in the last 50 years and was created by a committee of various scholars from different religious backgrounds.<br>  <br>  The importance of a recent translation is because in the past recent years we have found some more reliable greek and hebrew manuscripts that modern translations reflect in their works. The most famous example is the Dead Sea Scrolls. I believe they are the oldest collection of Old Testament Manuscripts to date. Not sure about that last statement though.<br>  <br>  So the BEST translation for a WORD for WORD methodology is <br>  NASB: The New American Standard Bible (1995 update) (really no debate about that)<br>  <br>  The BEST translation that uses a DYNAMIC EQUIVALENT is<br>  NIV: The New International Version<br>  <br>  There is probably a little bit of debate about the NIV being the best of dynamic equivalents, but manys scholars will use the NIV for their study. The New Living Translation is also a very good translation, but I personally think it takes a few too many liberties with the text.<br>  <br>  Also, a easy to read version is THE MESSAGE, however this is NOT a translation!!!

Bullinger), and I consider his non-biased footnotes invaluable, his opinion is in the appendices so proceed through them with spiritual discernment.  Strong's translates your Bible to Greek/Hebrew meanings and words(original manuscripts), as does Vine when it comes to things Strong's doesn't clear up, you will go far and understand much if you stay in these 3 books.<br>  <br>  Edit Bill C:  Mine does not, that is why I reccomended specifically the version I have, time to break down and purchase a new one like mine.

There are two basic approaches used by translators: <br>  <br>  (1)Essentially literal, which is seeks the closest English words that correspond to the Greek and Hebrew.  Explanation of difficult verses are in notes.  Translations using this philosophy read similarly.<br>  <br>  (2)Dynamic equivalent / paraphrase, (DE) seeks to render the same meaning to today’s reader that the ancient reader understood.  Difficult words and verses are rephrased for modern reader. This means that figures of speech are dropped in favor of plain statements, shorter sentences are used, and simple vocabulary is employed. Since translators don’t always agree on the best way to rephrase for the modern reader, DE translations vary quite a bit from one another in some verses.<br>  <br>  Dynamic equivalence method was originally developed to help missionary translators. It was thought to best for English also, but after a generation of reading DE translations, that thinking is hotly disputed by many scholars and pastors because many believe that too many details are lost in trying to improve readability.<br>  <br>  A book that explains the translation philosophy differences is “The Word of God in English” by Leland Ryken.  It is available as a free pdf here <a href="http://www.esv.org/translation/woge" rel="nofollow">http://www.esv.org/translation/woge</a><br>  A condense version of the WOGE is titled “Choosing a Bible: Understanding Bible<br>  Translation Differences <a href="http://static.crossway.org/excerpts/1581347308.1.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://static.crossway.org/excerpts/1581...</a><br>  <br>  Both translation approaches offer some advantages. Therefore, there is benefit in using several translations, at least one of each translation philosophy. <br>  <br>  Dynamic Equivalent (& Paraphrase) versions are probably the most useful for a beginning Bible reader or a young child. They are better for public reading to Biblically illiterate persons.  They can also provide a fresh rendering of a passage for a seasoned Bible reader. The best Bibles of this type in order from the least to most paraphrastic are the NIV, TNIV, and NLT.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, an essentially literal Bible should be one’s main Bible.  This is because (a) the richness of the figurative language is preserved for our contemplation, and (b) There is less interpretation of the translator that may color the text.  I prefer to have the translators argue different views in the footnotes or commentary.<br>  <br>  The best essentially literal Bibles, beginning with the most literal to the least are: NASB (1995 update), ESV, HSCB, and NET.  These are available in study bible form, which answer common questions about the text and are very helpful. One of the best study bibles available right now is the ESV study bible.

An excellent translation when originally made 400 years ago, but today, better manuscripts have been found and therefore, newer translations are more accurate. Plus, the old English, while beautiful, is simply confusing at some points. <br>  <br>  I’m afraid that if your online class is pushing the KJV that is getting pretty hard to defend intellectually.

Some people that only the KJV is accurate according to the originals.  the KJV was compiled first, in the 1500s, so many believe it to be the most accurate. It is true that the Dead Sea Scrolls, the oldest manuscripts we have of the Bible, support the KJV (and hundreds of manuscripts can be found with less than 1% of the words altered version to version).  But the NIV and NASB (new american student bible i think) are based off of original hebrew and greek manuscripts known as the Septuagint, which had words the originals didn't have, added by scribes as they copied the bible. that's why some people believe king james only. my opinion is, it's good to read KJV or NKJ for the original text, but it doesn't hurt to use more modern translations with help understanding... just dont use the message bible, it was written by only one man and contains new age doctrine slipped in.|`|4OEOxOmPaa	I read the New American Bible (Catholic) and KJV (Protestant) I can't stop laughing at either one.  <br>  <br>  <puts them both back under the air conditioner on the outside window sill and waits for Spring>|`|exRfWIRKaa	They're all equally violent, bloody, and contradictory|`|htQrkD8waa	The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.|`|KY0uiQWQaa	KJV, I believe it is the most accurate.|`|MM5iGrnIaa	Doesn't matter.|`|VxrsfAfyaa	Oxford New English, NIV, KJV and RSV

It is understood from the Quran, revealed over 1,400 years ago, that there is both; "Creation" and "Evolution." And in both instances, it is only Allah who is "Able to do all things." In fact, it was the Muslim scientists, more than 1,000 years ago, who set the stage for the advancement of learning, technology and disciplines in science that we know today.<br>  <br>  Allah has explained how He created everything in the universe and brought all life out of water. He created humans from earth (not monkeys) and there is no need to attempt fabrications of "links" to the animal world in Islam.<br>  <br>  The Christian Bible says that Adam & Eve were both created here on Earth, less than 10,000 years ago. The Quran says that Adam & Eve were created in Heaven, and NOT on Earth. When they disobeyed God, He expelled them from Heaven, down to Earth. <br>  <br>  Muslims believe that souls are assigned to humans 40 days after the human inception. The Quran says that angels retrieve human souls on two occasions. One occasion is when humans die. The other occasion is every time humans fall asleep. When humans wakeup, the angels release those souls back to them:<br>  <br>   It is Allah that takes the souls (of men) at death; and those that did not die, during their sleep: those on whom He has passed the decree of death, He keeps back, but the rest He sends (to their bodies) for a term appointed. Verily in this are Signs for those who reflect.<br>  [Noble Quran 39:42]<br>  <br>   And Allah has Created every animal from water; of them are some creeping on their bellies; some walk on two legs; and some on four. Allah Creates what He wills: for sure Allah has Power over all things.<br>  [Noble Quran 24:45]<br>  <br>  The Quran has set a precedent 14 centuries before modern science, explaining in simple and direct terms about his "creation" of animals and their various functions and then assures us it is He who has the Power over everything. This statement includes the fact Allah can if He Wills, reshape and alter his creation as He Chooses. There is clear evidence within many species of alteration and changes within the species. However, there is no concrete evidence to support a cross over in development from one type to another, such as reptiles turning into birds or alligators turning into cows. The statements made in Quran are quite clear when Allah tells us of having brought forth other life forms and then destroying or replacing them with others. This again, does not imply evolution in the sense of one type becoming or changing into another.<br>  <br>  Allah tells us He is Al-Bari, (The Shaper or Evolver) but once again, this does not mean He has a need to bring about each individual life form all from one kind. Actually, while reading the Quran you learn He has brought many types and shapes and sizes as He Wills. Changes within species occur even as quickly as one or two seasons, not even taking a whole year, much less millions as was supposed by Darwin.<br>  <br>  Speaking of Charles Darwin, he was only an armature naturalist and had only observed the finches (birds) on the Galapagos Islands for the first time in the mid 1850s. He noticed that on each island the birds had different shaped beaks according to the type of food available on their particular island. For this reason, he assumed, the birds had progressed over millions of years and only the hardiest of the species had survived the climate and vegetation changes. However, this is totally inaccurate and was dismissed as a mere humor in a TV series on the educational channel in October of 1998. According to the scientists? discoveries in that very same year, the effects of the weather phenomenon known as El Nino, the climate on these same exact islands had drastically changed in a single year within a number of months. And to their surprise, the eggs of the finches on each island hatched open producing birds with beaks already altered to accommodate the changes of their environment.<br>  <br>  The commentator even said this shoots Darwin's theory completely down and he laughed.<br>  <br>  There is no DNA research pointing to a connection between apes and humans as was supposed by the scientists and those who had financed them over the years. In fact, the barnyard pig is closer to humans in many aspects, than a monkey or a gorilla. Consider the fact, doctors use the skin from pigs to replace needed tissue on burn victims and the famous movie actor, John Wayne had a pig's heart valve installed in his own heart in a 1977 operation to save his life. It worked, too - until his smoking caused him to die of cancer.<br>  <br>  The rational approach to the whole subject is rather simple. Just as He is able to Create the universe and bring forth life, it is simple also for Him to produce as many different types of forms of life as He Wills. No problem for Him, after all - He is the Creator and He is the Shaper. And most important, He can change anything as He Wills - even today.|`|JRHR8T86aa	I am a born again christian and I do not agree with making death threats to any body but the only reason i get upset about evolution is because its just a theory with no proof and yet people act as if its fact. <br>  It having to do with how we got here doesn't bother me at all because people will believe in the most craziest ideas as long as they aren't held accountable to a almighty God.

Muhammad used the Quran to control his wives during his life (33:30-33) and even after his death (33:53). He told his wives that they will burn in hell if they betray him (66:3-5, 66:10).<br>  Muhammad was incorruptible and his motives were pure - Yes / No<br>  <br>  2) Muhammad was a warlord (Quran, Ch. 8 “Spoils of War”). He promised his soldiers booty and spoils of war (48:19-20) if they conquer Khaybar and Makka. The Jewish tribe Banu Qurayza betrayed Muhammad. Some of them (the men) were slain, others (the women) were captured (and sold into slavery) and Muhammad’s men took their land, houses and wealth (33:26-27). Muhammad was given permission to marry women who were made widows by his advancing army (33:50).<br>  Muhammad was a “messenger of peace” - Yes / No<br>  <br>  3) Apparently, being a prophet of Allah is not fully satisfying. Muhammad’s life-work was so unfulfilling that he needed more than one wife in order to feel complete. He was on the most important mission in history but he still had so much spare-time that he was able to marry many wives. During his practice of polygamy, Muhammad married his ex-daughter-in-law, his first-cousin, women whom he considered “spoils of war”, women for whom he had payed dowries and any woman who “gave herself to the Prophet” if he desired her (33:37, 33:50). In addition to his wives, Muhammad was allowed to marry slave-women whom his “right hand possessed” (33:52). This is the man who said that we should care about God alone because all of our sexual desires will be fulfilled in the afterlife.<br>  Muhammad, a holy man, “needed” all those wives - Yes / No<br>  <br>  4) The Quran is full of sexism (4:34, 2:223, 2:282, 12:28) and it allows men to use emotional and physical punishment to discipline their disobedient wives (4:34).<br>  As the Quran says, men are “a degree above” women (2:228) - Yes / No<br>  <br>  5) The Quran claims that, except for a few, all Jews are treacherous (5:13) and “listeners of falsehood” who are “greedy for illicit gain” (5:42). The worst enemies of the believers are the Jews and the idol-worshipers (5:82). Jews and Christians are only friends to each other (5:51).<br>  Allah needs to use stereotypes in order to simplify a complex world - Yes / No<br>       <br>  6) Allah takes credit for “natural” events such as lightning (13:13) flight (16:79) shooting stars (67:5) and earthquakes (16:15).

The result? Muslims practiced slavery (30:28), as well as sexual-slavery (23:6, 70:30), victimizing tens of millions of people, for over a thousand years. Muslims made it easy to find non-believers to enslave. They designated areas in Africa in which they would not preach Islam - so that slaves captured there would not turn out to be fellow Muslims.

If you put off essential activities because of procrastination, then your ability to prioritize effectively has to be called into question.  This is a fine line to judge between procrastination as filter for unnecessary tasks, and procrastination as laziness about accomplishing necessary tasks.  <br>  <br>  Personally, I find it to be a very two edged sword, and have tried to develop a sense of what really needs to be done versus what can be delayed or skipped all together.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|3GAiVmEAaa	I am miserable.

NQnOw4Qbaa	As a Protestant we believe that all saved Christians are Saints.  As a Catholic it's complicated.|`|Rj3epU5yaa	saints are part of the catholic faith.  people can be canonized for different reasons.  for example sir thomas more was executed in Britain for supporting the papacy when henry VIII formed the church of england.  he was beheaded and in the 1930's officially canonized and became the patron saint of politicians.  <br>  <br>  vatican law has other requirments for sainthood as well.  <br>  <br>  Mary is the virgin mother of jesus, thus she has a place of honor within the church, she has her own prayer.  "hail mary full of grace the lord is with thee."  ext|`|c23478f3a6f6ccbb83145c92645bca1aaa	in the Catholic faith we see saints as people who were just like you and I -- normal every day people who were able to be extra ordinary examples of Christianity.  For example, St Francis -- did you know he was rich and gave it all up for God!?  Saints are living proof that no matter how hard we think we have it -- someone already overcame what we did and did it well.  sure we look to CHrist as our primary example but let's face it - we are only human and can make the excuse - it's too hard for me, Jesus could do it because He is God.  I find it amusing that people get bent out of shape over the fact Catholics see some people as better examples than others.  I think St Francis is a much better example than some celebrity they have on their walls/screen saver.<br>  As for Mary -- Our Blessed Mother - God made the choice to bring her into Christ's life. Jesus made the choice to stay with her & listen to her -- even over his Father. He told her at the wedding it wasn't yet His time and yet -- He listened to His Mom.  His last dying act on the cross was to ensure her care and well being....  I will respect God's choice and Jesus choice and thus, Mary is a wonder representation of a true Christian woman.<br>  <br>  protestants don't even realize they founded martin luther said Mary was to be honoured.|`|AA11502346	She is Jesus' mother.  Nothing else.  Anyone who is a believer, living or dead, is a saint.  No need for canonization.|`|9DW9irIGaa	there are countless verses (e.g. Romans 1:7) in the new testament calling the common christians "saints". saints are not anyone holier than anyone else; they are just believers in jesus christ. however, christians don't call each other saints anymore. as for mary, she is the mother of jesus and no more-- she is human, not someone to pray to. (nowhere in the bible does it command us to pray to mary. but it does say there is only one God, and to pray to him only.)|`|AA11120822	I think they have a team prayer after every game in New Orleans.|`|s7pqFa1eaa	Did you read this question before submitting it?|`|yHfsHp6naa	The church makes a lot of money off of them.|`|6173ede5e3ea0a8b44522ccd89de7fe0aa	Are you looking for the Catholic answer, or a Christian (Biblical) answer?<br>  <br>  According to Catholicism, "saints" are people of "high standing" in Christianity who have elevated themselves by their works - which goes against what the Bible says. It says that even our best works are like filthy rags to God, and no man gets into Heaven by their works.<br>  <br>  According to the Bible, a "saint" is anyone who is saved, which includes myself and any other Christian. It doesn't mean that they're "perfect", because no one is perfect, except Christ. <br>  <br>  You cannot pray to a dead saint. They will not answer, because according to the Bible, everyone who has died is "asleep" in the grave until Christ resurrects them. They are not currently in Heaven, looking down at us and answering prayers. They have no consciousness of the presence of others or the passage of time. They have no feelings, thoughts, or memories in the grave. It's like a dreamless sleep. This is why it is futile for Catholics to pray to Mary or other saints. They cannot hear your prayers, because they are dead. Mary is dead and in the grave, and she is waiting for her Son to resurrect her. What people perceive as "apparitions of Mary" or other saints are actually "the spirits of devils, working miracles".

gsTpQmGfaa	Things don't just "happen", but look up the word "nothing" in the dictionary, there is no clear meaning. What was before this "big bang"? All life and possibility was as it still is, therefore nothing was created, since life is a product of life and so forth. Water changes into ice, it gets evaporated etc, this is just changes in energy, energy can never be created nor destroyed, only changed. Therefore, when we die it is possible that our lifeforce (or spirit) will live on, perhaps in another form. What makes me curious then is if we all have this lifeforce, what is the goal? It must be spiritual evolution, as nature shows us, the fittest survive which would point that our goal is spiritual evolution, and perhaps physical also so that we may have more spiritually efficient energy. When a caterpillar is eaten by a bird, does the caterpillars lifeforce become one with the bird, and the bird in turn become one with the earth, and the earth ultimately with the universe and so forth? So ultimately, it would seem existence is constantly re-defining itself so that it may take on higher forms of intelligence... I have heard people say that the big bang was a seperation from god, and now he is searching for himself again, but all possibility is contained in this one moment, therefore what we call "time" does not really exist. I don't know if the big bang was a seperation, perhaps it was just an expression of existence trying to express itself in different ways and create new possibilities as part of it's own spiritual evolution.|`|8UP6iQ5Zaa	For a christian who lives by faith, we see the evidence of God everywhere, especially in creation. And yes, everything is aligned with God's providential will. He controls all our "circumstances." But to understanding spiritual things without the help of God's Holy Spirit and total heart faith is impossible.<br>  <br>  1Cr 2:14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know [them], because they are spiritually discerned. <br>  <br>  Hbr 11:6 But without faith [it is] impossible to please [him]: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and [that] he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.|`|xlY5fu6raa	no one created God<br>  God is the creator|`|c7db39975c64a358eab6a0044a8a7223aa	I do not believe in a personal god who sits outside the universe interfering with the laws of nature and judging mankind. I believe in god in a Hindu sense, god defined a the eternal non dual whole of existence. Like, sometimes I wonder what it would be like to experience the universe as one whole. To experience reality from outside the limited view constructed by the human senses. <br>  <br>  The big bang fits right into the Hindu View of creation. In Hinduism, god or what they refer to as Brahman is seen as the eternal, unchanging, and non dual whole of reality. From a Hindu point of view the creation of the cosmos occurred when Brahman was concentrated at one point of absolute unity (referred to as bindu in Sanskrit) and then underwent an explosion and fractured itself into the manifested world of space, time, and whatever. In Sanskrit this is called, Spho?a, which literally means bursting and opening. <br>  <br>  There are also many other gods in Hinduism that represent some deeper truths. Vishnu, who is the maintainer and preserver, Vishnu would represent the logos (time, space, gravity, all the physical laws). There is Shiva the Destroyer and transformer, who represents the concept all things must pass, the idea that all material incantations decay...every human, animal, planet, star, and even universe. However from this decay and destruction comes creation. They knew that the universe worked through cycles of creation, preservation, destruction, and transformation. <br>  Hindu's see matter as an illusion (Maya), as just expressions of vibrating energy <br>  <br>  I have a big problem with this reductionist view of reality or the material atheists who want to reduce everything to mechanism and the interaction between parts. I would hate to live off in some objective reality, I want to particapate in reality. You know, live a bit.|`|jipqICzVaa	God has always been there. He will always be there in the future.|`|758cae615235590fa29ef1d7060ba6d7aa	If God created the universe, then who created God?<br>  A number of sceptics ask this question. But God by definition is the uncreated creator of the universe, so the question ‘Who created God?’ is illogical, just like ‘To whom is the bachelor married?’ <br>  So a more sophisticated questioner might ask: ‘If the universe needs a cause, then why doesn’t God need a cause? And if God doesn’t need a cause, why should the universe need a cause?’ In reply, Christians should use the following reasoning: <br>  1. Everything *which has a beginning* has a cause.<br>  2. The universe has a beginning. <br>  3. Therefore the universe has a cause. <br>  It’s important to stress the words in *in asterisks*. The universe requires a cause because it had a *beginning*, as will be shown below. God, unlike the universe, had *no beginning*, so doesn’t need a cause. In addition, Einstein’s general relativity, which has much experimental support, shows that time is linked to matter and space. So time itself would have begun along with matter and space. Since God, by definition, is the creator of the whole universe, he is the creator of time. Therefore He is not limited by the time dimension He created, so has no beginning in time—God is ‘the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity’ (Is. 57:15). Therefore He doesn’t have a cause.<br>  In contrast, there is good evidence that the universe had a beginning. This can be shown from the Laws of Thermodynamics, the most fundamental laws of the physical sciences.<br>  ? 1st Law: The total amount of mass-energy in the universe is constant. <br>  ? 2nd Law: The amount of energy available for work is running out, or entropy is increasing to a maximum. <br>  If the total amount of mass-energy is limited, and the amount of usable energy is decreasing, then the universe cannot have existed forever, otherwise it would already have exhausted all usable energy—the ‘heat death’ of the universe. For example, all radioactive atoms would have decayed, every part of the universe would be the same temperature, and no further work would be possible. So the obvious corollary is that the universe began a finite time ago with a lot of usable energy, and is now running down.<br>  Now, what if the questioner accepts that the universe had a beginning, but not that it needs a cause? But it is self-evident that things that begin have a cause—no-one really denies it in his heart. All science and history would collapse if this law of cause and effect were denied. So would all law enforcement, if the police didn’t think they needed to find a cause for a stabbed body or a burgled house. Also, the universe cannot be self-caused—nothing can create itself, because that would mean that it existed before it came into existence, which is a logical absurdity.<br>  <a href="Http://creationontheweb.com/content/view/1851" rel="nofollow">Http://creationontheweb.com/content/view...</a>|`|b06d5f5c50bd7cf1d8a2a3aedfcc1c94aa	We assume that there was a big bang because that it the best explanation for the evidence we have. That is how science works. If we get some evidence that indicates something else happened then we would change that theory.  We have no idea how, why or what started the big bang and we probably will not find out in our lifetime.

Have you ever heard of Dia De Los Muertos? It's a Mexican tradition that is really the origin of Halloween in America, and other similar celebrations in other parts of the world. It's a celebration/remembrance of the lives of loved ones who have passed, and the celebration includes a lot of skull/bone related symbolic items. <br>  <br>  Secondly, as far as a clothing trend, it's not something new. It's been around for over 30 years in punk & biker communities. It just seems to be a current trend. Some kids latch on to anything they think is cool or rebellious. Of course, it's not very rebellious if everyone is doing it. :) Apart from clothing, skulls & bones have been used to symbolize many things by many cultures/sub-cultures for hundreds of years, and probably least of all, death.<br>  <br>  I guess flames are a symbol of death if you believe in a Christian hell? I don't think most people would associate flames with death really, unless maybe they have a fire phobia or something. Again, it's just somewhat of a trend...nothing to get upset about. A persons choice in clothing is a personal decision and expression. Why should you care what any random kid or stranger wears?|`|h2HxsSJ5aa	It's not new.  The Hell's Angels did the same many years ago, and the Gothic tradition in literature dates back centuries.  In terms of today's youth, i'd say it was due to concern about the future of the world and their place in it.  They feel, understandably, that there is little hope for the future, and that the roles available in society are unsuitable for them and of questionable value.  The result is what might be dismissively called "teenage angst" by people who feel they've left that part of their lives behind, but there are different responses to that stage of life.|`|qokvnW1xaa	I'm not fascinated with skulls, to me the symbol of death is a BLU-82, dropped off a C-130 cargo plain, slowly dropping to surface on its marry way to incinerate the crap out of every living thing with in the 12 block radius.<br>  <br>  also, teens are usually stupid, and uncreative.

Well, just try to know, what’s makes God as god, the Power, isn’t it? So what the power can do? Ah? Well, it can give the ability to organise all things & it can give the ability to separate everything and most importantly, the Ability to control everything, isn’t it? Isn’t it good? Ah? So, what I try to say here is, from my hard study and research effort with the help from god, I realized that the ability to control everything, the Power of God is gradually increased in the full amount to use so; The Power of God is always the omnipotent and existed among everything. & The God now is always the same omnipotent for us, who is organised us and we are growing towards perfection. The perfection is the final stage, not the end. & The Power of God, the Ability is the reward for us to control everything in a proper manner, like the true God of goodness. & Everlasting Happiness is the final stage. & it cannot come alone without the final stage perfection of God. & if god always perfect in perfection then there have to be beginning with God for the organizing progress of all things. So, there is No end and also No beginning for all things, including this on going organizing progress. So we cannot get anything from nothing. & how could that be possible to be perfect in perfection always, ah…? No way has the perfection of god come first or the growth towards perfection. There is No End and there is No beginning and so the Ability is for the Love of Joy & ~ LOVE IS THE ABILITY ~ <br>  If you don’t still agree, then note this important point: - you can use any thing for Good or Bad so, whenever possible If you ask the god for the good reason to give you the ability perfection, because of your obedience, then the God will give you, if the god is good and Almighty. Simple logical prove (the evidence) for this concept. So, <br>  If you are humble, please... Pray to know the truth from true God by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit with great faith and. Good in Bad & Bad in Good so the values are most important. God gave us the rights to do what is right for you & sometimes, things can be right in your point of view but wrong in Public point of view so Basically, just pray about it for the Good Answer and try to do the God's will first always & If you think, why so much trouble and pain in this world…? Then there is only one reason, without pain, No pleasure and without pleasure, no pain. So without them, we cannot enjoy this life so always we need them in our development towards the perfection of God. So-so you use pain and pleasure instead of pain and pleasure use you. I mean the vision of your future should be clear & it have to pull you rather than you have to push so you must link a lot of pleasure in order to succeed in the Best job. When you feel strong enough links a lot of pleasure in your subconscious mind and your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure. & It is wonderful nature for us by the true God. And we all make mistakes so it is hard to look for star in daylight. So just in faith… it is possible. Like that the faith in true God. &  If you think, even expert can be wrong then you have to make the fine research in all most everything so It is hard and some time, it is impossible to achieve so Why we need inappropriate action to find the owner of higher power? So, because of Lack of faith in true God, we do not have the great gift of understanding of things. & All things are spiritually first, to govern by God with glory so closely, Have a look at this world of wonders of yours and then you know the truth, when you listen to your real voice and then Having a strong desire to do the best every day then stick with the best to do your best. And most importantly, try to be grateful for what you have now & try to know where you come from to have the great gift of understanding and then, have the faith to become the best winner in your life. & The Law of mercy cannot rob the Law of justice so Justice demands the punishment of our sin but The Law of mercy requires the forgiveness to give to us and God is perfect in perfection so cannot violate his laws so The God provided the way to our salvation to overcome our sin so Jesus Christ sacrifice is much needed to return to live with God, so Jesus Christ is our savior.<br>  Well, it is the time to make the great decision. <br>  Good luck. <br>  The power is focus with the great mindset <br>  If you find this useful, please help others. Thanks.<br>  |`|VnNzPKA8aa	Point?  there is a point to living? SHEESE! I hate it that I didn't get the freaking instruction book.

Rather than classify ourselves by where we live, we recognize ourselves as citizens united under God's government, regardless of where we may live. <br>  <br>   However, we do respect the authority of our local governments, and obey them in everything, so long as doing so does not conflict with God's laws. And I, personally, enjoy living in America. It's a neat place, with some gorgeuos areas like the Grand Canyon and the Redwoods, and I appreciate the fact that there is a lot of constitutionally-protected freedoms, which makes it easier for JW's to preach in this country. I also appreciate the United States Supreme Court and the European Court of Human Rights, for their many rulings which protect the freedom of worship of JW's in particular, and all people in general.|`|SvojbK7Kaa	I am only proud to be a true follower of Jehovah God.

For that reason, all children of Jehovah's Witnesses who had been expelled were permitted to again attend public school and not be ostracized for not saluting the flag.<br>  <br>  We do appreciate the freedoms and benefits of living in a country that offers a measure of freedom to all its citizens.

itPGB0dXaa	I'm a native English speak and I am currently teaching myself Japanese. I have always been interested in Japanese culture and i love the way it combines traditional and modern styles into a far eastern setting. I want to be able to have a better understanding of their culture from their perspective.<br>  <br>  Since i've started learning i've discovered just how much different it is to English than, lets say German from an English speaking point of view. The many different levels of speech, adjectives, verbs and their ease of use, even the word order (topic>subject>verb as opposed to the English topic>verb>subject). It has given me a greater appreciation and understanding of my own language in the process, and i feel like i'm being drawn in. <br>  <br>  The thought of being able to string sentences together coherently by myself gives me a real buzz.

9DW9irIGaa	absolutely do NOT disown her... be loving toward her. that doesn't mean you have to "condone" her sin. you probably won't be asked for your opinion often, but if you are, just humbly say you think it's wrong but you love her anyway. the worst thing you can do is quote a bunch of scriptures about homosexuality and leave her feeling like she is a failure. she will hate christianity and God. instead, show her God's unconditional love that he has for any sinner, us included. Rom. 5:8- while we were STILL sinners christ died for us. show her by your actions that you love her like God loves her. it's ok to stand up for the truth or yourself (e.g. ask her not to smoke around you). it's a lot harder when there is a person in her life that shouldn't be there. i had a friend for years who announced she was bi, then a lesbian, and dated a girl. i loved them both but i couldn't be around them when they were together. they knew this and respected it even though they thought i was closed-minded. that is probably how your relative will feel.<br>  p.s. if it's a sister, that is a closer relationship that might give you the opportunity to talk heart-to-heart with her. don't give up praying for her, whoever she is. God transforms lives! remember it's not the struggle with these addictions that's sin, it's giving into them. if she's ever open to talk, be willing to talk about her temptations without judging her. hope this helps :)|`|rU6nh42Eaa	She's still your cousin and a person who needs your love.  I would worry more about her bad habits she's getting into.  Those can harm or kill you.  I think she is going through a stage of rejecting some things and deliberately going the other way.  If she announced that she was bisexual and lived a normal drug-free, healthy, productive life, the issue would be her sexual preference.  The real issue is that she is very, very unhappy about something.  Forget her symptoms and treat the problem with lots of love.|`|sJZXhPxyaa	Did this relative recently start college?<br>  <br>  Just watch out for them - talk to them about drinking & drugging to make sure they don't get out of control and wreck their life and don't use gender as a way to judge who they date - make sure they are in good hands.  If your relatives' "sins" are not affecting you, or harming your relative, then you should not worry about it.  Don't let something silly affect your relationship.|`|OLiH8pSvaa	You love her by praying for her. Pray to God to help her.|`|FgdJpfiVaa	just cuz shes bi doesnt mean she needs to walk away from her faith<br>  TELL HER!|`|yj3GT7jOaa	Be an example.  Don't do the same things she is doing.

There is so much power in the name of Jesus Christ.|`|e51d513ea5bf8209f78025130c42d6a8aa	Great Question!  <br>  <br>  First, do not disown.  Make is clear that you desire to continue your relationship with this person.  However, someone close to this relative needs to explain to her and teach her the consequences and reality of the sinfulness of her recent decisions but reassure her that the family loves her and so does God and that she can be forgiven.  <br>  <br>  She probably won't like the talk but someone needs to make sure she knows the truth.  However, this talk may not even be necessary.  Because if you a strong religious family than without a doubt she knows that you do not agree with her recent decisions and in fact may expect you to condemn her.  So maybe you should surprise her by showing love and acceptance as a person.|`|AA11502346	I would continue to pray for her.  You DO NOT DISOWN your relative under any circumstances.  You hate the sin and love the sinner.  That means that you love your relative just as much as you did when she was in the faith.<br>  <br>  As far as being bisexual is concerned, if she stays chaste and goes back to her faith, then she's okay.  It's one thing to have an inclination to the same sex; it's a totally different thing to act on that inclination sexually.  Sex, as you and I know, is for married heterosexual couples.|`|JWSkzyQ7aa	You know, i'm christian, i understand. I hate smoking, drugs, not old to drink, but... <br>  What the hell? <br>     You love someone no matter what? Remember that? And uh, Duh, just be calm with it. It's kinda how i think of Ned Flanders on the simpsons, overprotective, totally bible-crazy {Which is fine, i'm not judging} but just because your loved one has made her descion, who are just going to shun her? <br>  No, If you want to be a real smart person, and actually be called a christian rather than a saint, or a freak, not that you or i care though, JUST GO ON AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED. I mean it's her personal choice, and i'm sorry,  YOU have NO say in what she does. Unless she hurts herself or others.<br>  And btw, I don't follow the bible 100% or 50%, more like 1.5 %<br>  get it?|`|a8687a650a19834bc4b30491b67daa9baa	You could just see her as the person she is and not worry about dealing in a 'biblical way'.

Provide a good role model, don't try to force anything on her.<br>  <br>  If she's ready to change, and sees that her family that have stayed "faithful" have been good and true, then she may rejoin what you consider to be the righteous.<br>  <br>  If all you do is harp on her, call her wicked, or turn your back on her, then even when she is ready to change, she won't be turning to you.<br>  <br>  I believe there's a book somewhere that has a tale about a Prodigal Son or something in it.  You may want to check that out.  I hear it's pretty good for situations like this.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	She probably walked away from her faith because of the inability of many Christians to simply accept her for who she is. It's been drilled into her head that she will go to hell for something she has no control over (her sexual orientation), so she probably figures it doesn't matter what she does.<br>  <br>  I went through the same thing: My loving church put me through two exorcisms, my pastor tried to talk me into suicide, and then tried to blackmail me. He had told me that as a gay man, I was useless to God, useless to the church, and useless to society. I believed him. I didn't take my life, but I did leave the church and God. I figured that if I was doomed anyway, it didn't matter what I did. I had spent years praying, fasting, asking God to change me, and nothing happened. So I gave up.<br>  <br>  But God didn't. He reached out to me where I was, and told me He still loved me... just the way I was. He showed me that the condemnation I had experienced came only from people, and never from Him. When I asked about scripture, I got one answer: Study. And so I read the scriptures in their original languages. They don't say anything bad about homosexuality.<br>  <br>  I came back to God, was ordained a minister, and worked establishing new churches and pastoring for many years... all as a gay man, confident of God's unconditional love.

Romans 1:26-27 teaches specifically that homosexuality is a result of denying and disobeying God. When a person continues in sin and disbelief, the Bible tells us that God “gives them over” to even more wicked and depraved sin in order to show them the futility and hopelessness of life apart from God. 1 Corinthians 6:9 proclaims that homosexual “offenders” will not inherit the kingdom of God.<br>  <br>  God does not create a person with homosexual desires. The Bible tells us that a person becomes a homosexual because of sin (Romans 1:24-27), and ultimately because of their own choice. A person may be born with a greater susceptibility to homosexuality, just as people are born with a tendency to violence and other sins. That does not excuse the person choosing to sin by giving into their sinful desires. If a person is born with a greater susceptibility to anger / rage, does that make it right for then to give into those desires? Of course not! The same is true for homosexuality.<br>  <br>  However, the Bible does not describe homosexuality as a “greater” sin than any other. All sin is offensive to God. Homosexuality is just one of the many things listed in 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 that will keep a person from the kingdom of God. According to the Bible, God’s forgiveness is just as available to a homosexual as it is to an adulterer, idol worshipper, murderer, thief, etc. God also promises the strength for victory over sin, including homosexuality, to all those who will believe in Jesus Christ for their salvation (1 Corinthians 6:11; 2 Corinthians 5:17).|`|yvDzvIbBaa	have you ever rubbed another man down with oil?<br>  <br>  jesus did. <br>  <br>  hmmm.|`|ucuP0boCaa	I consider it very possible.

He possessed that snake and spoke through it.  I've seen people possessed by Satan and have witness Satan speaking through these people in voices other than the person's own voice, similar to the exorcist movie, but their necks didn't spin around but they were controlled to the point were they were on their hands and knees with their fingers in the positions of claws crawing about.  I've even seen the evil spirit pick them up from the floor and tossed them across the floor. Back in the garden of Eden, the only people were Adam and Eve and Satan was not able to possessed them because they had not  turned their will over to him, so he had to possessed another creature. |`|04021fc4881460602edfbe93dc6ae44eaa	The snake symbolizes a spiritual force, something that connects all our civilizations to some point in which our perception was Shaman.<br>  <br>  As much as people try to divide it into White and Black in order to try to understand its substance (predominantly the West civilization today), it is still one same force along which we mature.<br>  <br>  Perhaps this site might help you grasp the picture:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://deoxy.org/narbystew.htm" rel="nofollow">http://deoxy.org/narbystew.htm</a>|`|AA11039615	The serpent was lucifer, aka satan himself and he gets that name from his glistening and his hissing whispering voice.   satan can appear as an angel of light and he has many names throughout the Bible for all his little roles he plays.  he's a mimic and a deceiver.|`|45ef8ccda7bdd1f20216d7d9a81d77dcaa	Satan disguised himself as a snake to git close to Eve.<br>  Yu cain't jest walk in IN yuur Devil Outfit.<br>  Oh yu thot shee was a Dumb Blonde.<br>  Well not THAT DUMB.|`|c5dvbozoaa	The serpent represents the male reproductive organ, the apple represents the female reproductive organ.|`|bmf8ed7Haa	That's a chinese dragon.

I fought it but by my early 20s I realised that I was fighting against myself and nobody else. I wish as a teen I'd have learnt to love myself and not hate myself for being different. I was in a minority ethnically, sexually and because I was chubby so felt I was always fighting when I really didn't need to do that. <br>  <br>  I certainly don't think it's about choice as I would have chosen not to be gay given any choice. I'm not sure about the word 'triggered' through. Is it? Or is it nature being realised without a significant trigger - my 'trigger' would be sitting next to cute boys at school - there was one occasion I can remember very fondly when I was squeezed next to someone a little bit too close - it's strange I can't remember really fancying the person (my mind was with another classmate!) but he was certainly someone who 'set me off' so to speak and so it's certainly a very fond memory. <br>  <br>  I'm really uncertain about everyone carrying the gene - I think some people are just born gay, some people are born straight and some are bisexual. The first scientist to really examine male sexuality was Dr Kinsey who concluded that people are born into the following discrete groups:<br>  <br>  Rating  Description<br>  0  Exclusively heterosexual<br>  1  Predominantly heterosexual, only incidentally homosexual<br>  2  Predominantly heterosexual, but more than incidentally homosexual<br>  3  Equally heterosexual and homosexual; bisexual.<br>  4  Predominantly homosexual, but more than incidentally heterosexual<br>  5  Predominantly homosexual, only incidentally heterosexual<br>  6  Exclusively homosexual<br>  <br>  These groups aren't static but (in my opinion) changing from one to another is rare.

I personally believe that being homosexual is not a choice. So the fact that there may be some scientific evidence supporting what I know to be true is a relief. <br>  The article you mentioned is very interesting, I have heard that sexuality is changed while in the womb, if you are exposed to more male hormones or female hormones..and stuff like that. I think anything related to genetics or the brain is so very complicated that it will probably be a very long time before any scientist has good enough evidence to support why some people are homosexual.|`|VrPTLsecaa	I actually find it DEEPLY offensive when people regard it as a choice. For example, back before prop 8 was voted in, there was a site supporting prop 8 that you can take a "quiz". One of the questions was "Do you think that the fight for gay marriage today is similar to the fight for civil rights in the 50's and 60's?

I am not an expert in this field, but have read a number of articles that have alluded to certain proposed concepts.  There has been a lot of research on the subject.  None of which is conclusive.  i.e. no "gay gene" identified to my knowledge.  There was an interesting study that showed a correlation between the development of the inner ear of lesbians and males.  If the sensory organs of lesbians and males are similar this might lead one to hypothesis that the way lesbians interpret their surroundings is similar to heterosexual males.  That's my own personal idea.  Please remember that there are many genes that function in development of an individual, not all sex linked.  Many autosomal genes play a part in making an individual male or female and not just in the physical sense.  Does that mean that a mutation causes lesbianism, not to my knowledge.  The myriad of interactions that occur that make us who we are is to dynamic to distill down to a single gene.  In my mind a defect is something that causes harm to an individual.  Clearly homosexuality does not fall into that category unless you consider the harm inflicted on them by an oppressive and narrow minded society.  This area is further convoluted by the fact that there are those individuals that will jump on any bandwagon and may say their gay just for the attention, as apposed to those who truly struggle with their sexuality.  I have always believed that your true sexuality is not something you choose it is just part of who you are, like eye color or a widows peak.

If she has an implanted embryo, or 2, and they don't make it, I don't know, but with the idea that 1 or 2 will survive and up to 4 probably wouldn't, I don't think it is right. And with 6 at home, and knowing one implantation led to twins, I would think she would know the complications.<br>  <br>  I just hope somebody helps her find living quarters. Despite the fact I think she is wrong in how she went about having her family, I hope something can be worked out so the family can stay together.

That is no one else's decision.<br>  <br>  No mother should ever be made to feel bad for reducing. WIth every extra kid, they will likely be more pre-mature. All the kids could die in some situations, and for some people it is better to give one or two a better chance to survive instead of potentially killing all their babies and the mom.<br>  <br>  From my understanding, when they implant eggs they never just do one.

Depression is real and can be serious, I know I've had it myself. I dont know how old you are, but if you aren't already on medication, please find some way to get to a doctor. It is very important to nip depression in the bud before it gets worse. If you are already on medication, please continue to take it no matter what your parents or church members say. I pray that you have better health.|`|Yhy5jtsNaa	Im christian, i have borderline personality disorder, and with that comes a whole lot of s*it, i take my meds and pray to god for help and it all helps<br>  <br>  mental illnesses are as real as cancer and many Christians will accept people need help for that so why do they add to the stigma of mental health<br>  <br>  and im planning on studying psychology soon once i have raised the cash|`|1a42bf28fe11e609b0c68795bce43d6baa	I don't know how anyone can say that chemical imbalances don't exist. I also know that some of them are caused by sins. Bitterness is a sin that can cause a person to have a total mental breakdown. After getting rid of the bitterness the person got better. So, I believe that chemical imbalances exist, and that ONE reason for them is a continual sin of some sort.|`|IQWyPohEaa	I believe that chemical imbalances and other physical problems can cause a person's behavior to be "off" -- sometimes.<br>  <br>  But I don't think such things explain ALL human behavior.   I don't think they are ALWAYS an excuse for everything that a person does wrong.<br>  <br>  In most cases, I think wrongdoing is a free act.<br>  <br>  .|`|Fpi8im9taa	I'm sorry but those elders are dead wrong. Thousands of people are currently suffering from depression, Christian or otherwise. And medicines are proven to help.<br>  <br>  Yes, I believe in psychology. To deny it, I have to say, is illogical. <br>  <br>  There are chemical imbalances in the brain, and medicines generally help the pain. Your parents are completely wrong as well. They're just playing the ignorance card.|`|bTA5ndeMaa	When we look at the human condition of imperfection, the following is imminently clear:<br>  We suffer from a variety of illnesses, some deadly, some not.  These diseases affect every system of the human body, bones, skin, livers, kidneys, and most definitely the brain.<br>  <br>  Some people are born monsters, some as conjoined twins -- for some people, church leaders, to oppose reality simply is a clear demonstration to you that your church is in error.<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with any of us experiencing whatever disease we may suffer from, no shame, nor denial is needed.<br>  <br>  Seek professional help, but don't forget to ask God for help.  Especially ask him for help in finding the proper treatment.<br>  <br>  Depression: ask your medical professional.  But it is my opinion (uneducated) that becoming active outside, walks, sports, work, book reading -- in other words, being busy, helps us fight this darkness of our souls.<br>  <br>  I believe walking and running, jogging - have been demonstrated to produce some kind of brain chemical that helps fight depression.<br>  <br>  Do not let anyone look down upon you for suffering depression.  The Bible tells us to comfort those that suffer from it.<br>  |`|bW4RET0Waa	Guess they haven't had a baby then. When I had both on mine I got depressed after. Didn't go on pills for it but it sure was real. I am a Christian and one of Jehovah's Witnesses. We do believe it is serious. Anything that would interfere with a person's spirituality is serious. We also were not created to have cancer but we do whatever we can to get rid of it. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. <br>  <br>  You sound like an adult. If so, drop the subject with them.

She also attended the same church as me!<br>  My aunt, also a devout Lutheran, suffers from Bi-Polar Disorder, and is under the care of a psychiatrist.<br>  I believe that God has given these doctors the wisdom and the knowledge to diagnose these things and the meds with which to help.|`|4jOi2KETaa	Having suffered from depression myself, it is a medical fact that depression can be caused by a lack of certain neurotransmitters.The medicine I took helped. Depression can also be caused by negative thinking, low blood sugar, poor nutrition, boredom, and demonic oppression. God can certainly heal depression. Don't let anyone put you down about it. I didn't get help for years becasue I thought it was some sort of character weakness and felt ashamed over it. I excuse myself for that stupidity because when depressed one is not thinking straight. Pray and take the medicine. But watch out for side effects. Memorize scripture and fight the negative thoughts with God's word. For example, everytime your mind says "I can't" immediately cast that thought down and say "I can do all things through Jesus Christ who strengthens me". God bless you. You will come out of this victorious!|`|XbuvO2DLaa	Yes, it is true.

I haven't looked into the evidence or testing for it to make a decision on it.  I am sure that there are pros and cons.  God can heal it if you have faith.  I heard a good quote from a guy, he said either we believe God can fix it, or we are just playing church.  I guess that's the answer that you have to find.|`|pqqDS4sfaa	so funny you ask this....my preacher preached on this tonight. YES there is such thing...<br>  <br>  Lots of people think these diseases are demons...they arent if they are christians. a demon cannot enter a person that has the holy spirit. neither can it take its place. so yes there is such thing as depression..and there is such thing as demons.<br>  There are other diseases such as cancer ect..so why couldnt there be mental diseases!!! 
cd2etz5Raa	I agree with you 100% ... That's not the way to do it. The Gospel isn't about shoving Jesus and scripture down peoples throats at all, and yet people still do it. That's like forcing a kid to play piano - the kid will probably end up hating it in the end because he or she was forced into it. <br>  <br>  Please know that not all Christians do this. My home church actually tends to stay away from preaching around the streets and such. Our motto is, "It's our mission to love people into a relationship in Christ." which means rather than telling them about Christ with words and such, we do it in a loving way. Weekly outreaches such as dollar car washes (where we GIVE someone a dollar to let us wash their car) water and soda giveaways, we host parties for people with special needs, we host 100% free-of-charge block parties in needy neighborhoods, and we make it a point to only mention God or Jesus if someone else mentions it first.<br>  <br>  It gets a much better response, and I personally think that it's healthier for us and for the people we are reaching out to.<br>  <br>  Take care!!! :)|`|D9lMg7A2aa	And the point is what ?|`|xLKPKgZXaa	It might be a nuisance to those who don't wish to hear but that does not change the fact that it is GOOD NEWS.

If you wrote an article that was non-fiction and based on fact, and i read it and took everything you said out of context to suit me and my basis for an argument, would that make your article any less true in your own eyes?

The term is intentionally derogatory, and is used most commonly by those opposed to the Christian Right movement. The term is often associated with religiously motivated conservative moral beliefs, especially those regarding social issues.<br>  <br>  Since the mid 1990's the word has been crossed with the word retard to create the term "fundietard".<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundie" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundie</a><br>  <br>  I don't see it being cool in any form.

Creationism doesn't prove who the creator is and according to Scriptural texts, doesn't really give us any kind of explanation of how the world was created- just that it was. It's all about faith, not fact. Those are two very different things and this is why you're not getting answers to your satisfaction. An interesting aside: if you read the beginning of Genesis very carefully, a primordial soup is definitely implied as what God started with, if you believe in creationism, that is. Also, the bible says that elohim is the creator, the tetragrammaton YAHWEH isn't used until later in the bible.

In Islam it's Allah, in Christianity it's God, in Hinduism it's Purusha/Brahma, and many holy books say these things, but ultimately if you believe this it's because you have faith that what your holy book is telling you is correct, not because it's been an empirically proven fact. |`|jtEOvGKsaa	WHAT?!

What science doesn't know is gravity universal? Maybe. Maybe not. No one has measured gravity for every atom and every star, where is  missing entropy, and why isn't gravity stronger. Is it leaking in from an other universe? There are numerous alternative theories that should be taught on an equal basis with gravity. For example, the observed behavior of the earth revolving around the sun can be perfectly explained if the sun has a net positive charge and the planets have a net negative charge. Opposite charges attract and the force between them follows the inverse-square law, exactly as the increasingly discredited Theory of Gravity. Physics and chemistry texts used to use this same logic as the explanation for electrons orbiting atomic nuclei. But then electrons stopped orbiting and began inhabiting orbitals, with all those strange shapes. Who made up those weird f-orbitals?<br>  <br>  Edit.

(Genesis 1:1; 2:3; 2:4; Psalm 148:5; Isaiah 40:26; 42:5; 45:18). This principle of transcendent creation is made more explicit by passages like Hebrews 11:3 which states that the universe that we humans can measure and detect was made out of that which we cannot measure or detect. Also, Isaiah 45:5-22; John 1:3; and Colossians 1:15-17 stipulate that God alone is the agent for the universe’s existence. Biblical claims that God predated the universe and was actively involved in causing certain effects before the existence of the universe is not only found in Colossians 1 but also in Proverbs 8:22-31; John 17:24; Ephesians 1:4; 2 Timothy 1:9; Titus 1:2; and 1 Peter 1:20.<br>  <br>  The frame of reference in Genesis 1:1 is the cosmos. God declares that He brought into existence the entire physical universe—matter, energy, and all the space-time dimensions associated with matter and energy. Einstein's theory of general relativity tells us that the cause of the universe creates it independently (i.e. from outside) of matter, energy, and the space-time dimensions along which matter and energy are distributed. (Observations now securely establish the reliability of general relativity.) <br>  <br>  Genesis 1:2 explicitly shifts the frame of reference, the narrator's vantage point, to the surface of Earth above the water but below the cloud layer. That verse describes the initial conditions of primordial Earth: its surface was dark, covered with water, empty of life, and unfit for life. With the frame of reference and the initial conditions for the six creation days thus established, a straightforward chronology for the creation days' events unfolds.<br>  <br>  "This is what the LORD says-your redeemer, who formed you in the womb: I am the LORD, who has made all things, who alone stretched out the heavens, who spread out the earth by myself" (Isa. 44:24).<br>  Seven verses, Job 9:8; Psalm 104:2; Isaiah 40:22; 42:5; 44:24; 51:13; and Zechariah 12:1 employ the Qal active participle form of the verb natah. This form literally means “the stretcher out of them” (the heavens) and implies continual or ongoing stretching.

It's not necessary to, in order to be a Catholic in good standing with the Church.<br>  <br>  Some of them only apply to priests, monks, and nuns.

After this he gave himself entirely to the work of his Father.<br>  <br>  The verse I have in mind regarding his trade is where they say, 'Is this not the carpenter's son...'|`|AA11272456	His adoptive father taught him the trade of carpentry, but once he undertook his full time ministry, Jesus was not employed.  He had no job, no savings, no checking account, no home, no income.  He put into practice what he taught; specifically Matthew 6:33.  He put first the kingdom and his Heavenly Father made sure he had all the necessities.<br>  <br>  Thus, although he was homeless, he never slept on a park bench.  Although he was unemployed, he never missed a meal.  Although he had no income, his clothes were so nice, the Roman soldiers did not want to damage his garment but rather maintained it whole and threw dice to see who would get it.<br>  <br>  He did no conjuring tricks, as you say, since that would be a violation of the Law Covenant to which he was in submission.  He did not misuse his authority and divine power for himself (see Luke 4:3, 4); neither did he use his power to produce things and sell them commercially.  <br>  <br>  Despite your sarcasm at the end, I gave the benefit of the doubt, as Jesus would do, and looked upon your question as a sincere one. So I hope this helps you out and you are able to see the benefit of taking God at his word.

1HB0q7S4aa	Christ has called me by my name twice through strangers! Nothing can make me deny His existence.|`|4xLqf5ASaa	That's a logical non-sequiter.  If there was evidence strong enough for me to denounce my faith, than I would need to see that evidence before I denounce my faith.  Otherwise, I cannot tell you what that evidence would be because I have not seen it yet.  So I guess until I see such evidence, I will believe the evidence I have encountered to this point, which is that Jesus is God and He died for my sins.|`|GUxACBI5aa	Faith is a funny thing really. I can believe, I guess, that there was a man called Jesus way back in the day. He could very well have been a carpenter. He also could very well have walked around and preached the word of god. That's all just fine with me. However, there is no actual proof that he was the son of god, that he could heal people and the like. No physical proof at least. Now most christians will say, yes there is, the bible says so. But that isn't exactly proof. You can believe it is, and that also is just fine. But I can say that I believe Superman is real and has powers, because the comic book I have says so. I don't know that there will ever be any real proof, but I suppose anything is possible. I'll stick to what I believe in right now though. |`|znL4i3Nvaa	Like I say, there are no proofs he exists. Just that stupid calendar, yeah it is only that, but in some countries who aren't filled with stupid people who believe in an old, long haired chihuahua, that has some hippie ideas or whatever they are, the calendar is different. Yeah right. <br>  For Allah, the muslim's belief there are proofs, Allah was actually called Muhammad and lived in Arabia and one day he got some ideas about a new belief. That is all and there are proofs he used to live, EVIDENCES, something you christians don't even know the meaning. Muslims brought wisdom to the word and christians only brought fights. Wake up people this is the real world. There is no god. The very famous person you believe in. That is your life and not god's. GOD isn't gonna get ya out of trouble when you need, isn't gonna do anything to you. How you get out of trouble? It is not about god, it is about your brain. So my point is, what proofs are he does exist? |`|AA10882449	I have a waning faith in people already. However, if I did believe in Jesus, I think the lack of evidence and the ridiculous claims were what caused me to stop believing. <br>  <br>  "If I [Jesus] bear witness of myself, my witness is not true." (John 5:31)<br>  <br>  I wouldn't say Jesus never exsisted, I just don't think he was the Son of God. Over a hundred people had this title and most have been forgotten, some many more thousands of years before Jesus. They were all born Dec. 25th, Born of a virgin and died at Easter. They performed miracles, walked on water, etc... <br>  <br>  If you look to the stars, you will see that on Dec 24th, the three stars that make up Orion's Belt are in perfect alignment with the point the sun (Son) will "rise" on Dec 25th. This comes from The Virgin (virgo) region of the sky. This is no more than a newer spin on a VERY old story. Read the Egyptian story of Horus and Het. Read the story of Krishna. Nothing but old stories, but so similar, you'd swear they were quoting the bible.|`|MXX2q4aWaa	If man's logic leads him to believe in evolution, which has no evidence, and gay marriage, which goes against common sense, then yes, my faith is not based on that logic. |`|si3eq11haa	my faith is not based on logic or reasoning, that's what makes it faith...<br>   i believe that God is who He says He is.

God said, "come, let us reason together".  Most people would rather just throw up their hands and ridicule believers.  They don't want to spend the time it takes to connect the old testatment prophecies with the new testatment fulfillment.  It's there if you want to see it.|`|G4SwEHP5aa	What evidence would that be.  I'm curious.  To believe or not believe is a matter of faith.  If there were evidence for unbelief, why would faith be required?  If faith is not based on logic, can you prove or give empirical evidence of the existence of Caesar, Cleopatra, Socrates or your mom's love for you?|`|31e0283ff8bc957ec9168709f61d5bf0aa	I have found many things I need to find about Jesus.

yMVMi8Ucaa	OK, I'm a Christian and often fall into the 'fundamentalist' category... That is, I am committed to my faith and all that it teaches me.<br>  <br>  So, you can probably gather by now that I think homosexuality is not something that God approves of...<br>  <br>  HOWEVER...<br>  <br>  God does approve of us being obedient to the law of the land insofar as it is not in contravention of His will for us (that's right for me - not you). That is why cryso's answer is not well thought through... Of course the state overrides in these issues - the question is should the church override the state. That is the question that most Christian answers have missed - do we think the church should have the authority to override the state and hence the opinions and thoughts of the majority of the people living in that state. Did God not give man the authority to determine the laws that should govern his lands?<br>  <br>  When it comes to gay marriage I can see why many Christians might oppose it based on a moral dislike and a desire not to see their country descend into what they feel is greater moral decay. However, I am more concerned with opposing injustice rather than this issue.<br>  <br>  Personally I think that if the people of a country desire to institute gay marriage then that is their right. It doesn't mean I have to agree with it but it is their right to do so. Honestly, the church should really concern itself more with changing the inner heart of man rather than focusing on the external displays of that. After all, that was exactly what Christ condemned the Pharisees for doing and so we should certainly not follow suit. Christ was not a political activist and so we should ask ourselves if we should be? Certainly we should speak truth and truth that affects the hearts of man but should we actively campaign against the desires of most people? Surely that is restricting their freedom... Anyway, righteousness comes from within and not by obeying external laws irrespectiveof how good they are - that is the Christian message. So why worry about the laws of the world - they cannot make you righteous or unrighteous in any case - it is what comes from within that achieves that.<br>  <br>  Anyway, that's my 2 cents worth... If the people want gay marriage then it is a state matter to decide and not a religious one. Let the churches instead become concerned with serving rather than condemning and giving rather than restricting.<br>  <br>  In return I ask you... If the people want to restrict marriage to between male and female - are you willing to accept the desires of the people? You ask Christians to accept what you believe is right but if you live in a country where most are Christians and believe gay marriage is wrong - are you prepared to live with that for a while?<br>  <br>  Do you see the dilemma here? You believe this is morally right which is why you want it, Christians believe it is morally wrong which is why they don't want it. Ultimately we have to ask ourselves is there a greater oppression that is resulting from the desires of the people... and we so often get the answer to that wrong - after all, consider how long the institution of slavery lasted!|`|ESQzBFOraa	I don;t sodomy, my wife doesn't like sodomy.<br>  The gay men live on sodomy.

Indeed, even in the 1800's the US was thought to be vastly underpopulated.  This was codified in many laws, with religion as principle means of enculturation. <br>  <br>  As for the US, one of the key ideas behind the formation of a representational democracy, was religious tolerance, as is embodied in the 1st amendment.  But this did not mean that the laws of the land were not based on common laws comming from a long history of religious tradition.  They were exactly that.  Hence, the notion of marriage as between one man and one women was carried to the US.<br>  <br>  Threre is nothing wrong with taking what is good from such traditions.  Most laws, such as the homicide laws, are common sense, and it doesn't matter what chruch they come from.  But when codified in US law, they become secular, and part of the US moral structure.<br>  <br>  That structure, can and does change, all the time.  And it should do so, based on the  reason, and humanity of the citizens,  and not on notions of dogma based on needs long gone.  If a christian wants to argue that gay marriage is bad for the county for rational reason, I want to here it.  But the morality, the laws of the country, is for all citizens to decide, not just those who claim to be superior by right of religion.<br>  <br>  It'll move forward with time.  It may take a while, but allowing gay marriage would be good for the country, and it would be a positive step toward improving the humanity of our country, so it will happen in time.  It's hard to say how long it will take, but a lot of progress has been made in the last 50 years.  |`|52bde836ca60fe6d4e329fcac4038a1daa	Gay people deny themselves happiness that come from children, a loving partner of the opposite sex, and an the blessings from a god who favors marriage between man and woman. <br>  <br>  i believe in divine retribution. ie god will punish a "group of people" when they are ripe in iniquity. <br>  <br>  homosexuality is an iniquity and we are ripe. god is punishing us in many forms. you cant and wont see these forms if you constantly dismiss it as impossible.

Religion does have it's place in politics, and the government is suppose to be prohibited from preventing it's free expression, even within the government.<br>  <br>  The majority view the gay lifestyle as repulsive and detestable, and this is not only from those who hold a religious perspective. Why should the majority legitimize an abhorrent act of a minority of the people? <br>  <br>  Let me put this another way. A person is free and has the right to eat dog s**t. The majority would find this repulsive and disgusting, but would agree that those who enjoy this can do so if they wish. Now suppose this minority starts trying to enact laws saying that others "discriminate" against them because of what they enjoy doing, that they are "hated" for it, and are in need of legal protection to practice it. They inundate the media and prime TV shows with "in your face" tactics, trying to desensitize and promote their activity as being a "normal" way of life and that it should be accepted. <br>  <br>  Guess what... the majority will still think it's sick and depraved, and will resent the mind control propaganda... especially the ones aimed at their children on Saturday morning cartoon segments and "infomercials". They would vote against anything that would legitimize that lifestyle.<br>  <br>  Get the picture... and without religious references too.|`|xfYinIR5aa	Uh, I'm Catholic and I'm totally cool with it.

However, this sounds better if you are talking about a man than a woman.  To some people this would imply that a woman was sexually experienced, which is not necessarily a good thing.  Some people would clarify the expression by saying the person was "street smart" implying that the person had acquired experience through a tough life, not in school or on the job.  You can also say someone has "been around."  Again, this sounds good for a man but tends to have negative, sexual connotations when used of a woman.  If you say the person is "wise," as others have suggested, to some that implies he is a smart aleck, making wise cracks, rather than truly smart and good at applying wisdom.  Another expression I have heard is "He/she has his/her head on straight."  This implies less about experience than about the results of the experience -- that it has given the person the proper perspective on life.  You can also say that someone has "been through a lot."  This may suggest that you feel sorry for the person, though, unless you follow it up with some statement that you admire the person, or something like that.  So, as you can see, there are a lot of ways to say what you want, but it depends who you are talking about, what sex, and what else you want to imply.|`|1nBYQZsvaa	Sarah Palin (not Obama)|`|W6gKHMemaa	Experienced...?<br>  |`|U6y9GcJ5aa	Experience does make men wiser.

By definition, anything that God does is good - even if we cannot see what the good is.<br>  <br>  <br>  About your examples:  until you can tell us *why* God instructed people to do these things, you cannot properly judge the morality of them.

He could have trashed us all for our design violations. Would you walk into a court of law and say, "Yo Dude, Waz up?" to the judge? People did not honor God by breaking His laws. Have you ever hated someone? That is considered murder in your heart in God's court. All the sins listed in the scriptures you printed were serious design violations.

Most likely, but in a spirit realm that overlaps ours, therefore they will be occupying the same space as us but entirely beyond physical contact, not actually being physically there.

6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Esto no es cuestión de estar en el cielo o en el infierno, son seres humanos igual que todos pero con diferentes inclinaciones sexuales. Se y conozco algunos bisexuales y homosexuales que son personas maravillosas, profesionales, decentes, pero que no tuvieron culpa de su inclinación sexual. Sé y me consta por un caso muy cercano que sufren mucho, ya que son rechazados por la sociedad y tratados como seres anormales y eso no está bien. NINGUNO PIDIó NACER ASí. Muchos también fueron violados de peque?os y obligados hacer cosas que los marcaron para siempre y de grandes se confundieron sus inclinaciones sexuales. Esto amigo, preguntalo a un sicólogo y verás que es la verdad.<br>  <br>  Debemos es aprender a respetarlos, porque por más que se les diga que el hombre se hiso para la mujer y viceversa es algo que tienen en ellos que les impide ser heterosexuales.<br>  <br>  Solo te pido que le digas a tu amigo, que visite a un terapeuta para que le preste ayuda. <br>  <br>  Mis saludos para ambos y ayudalo ya que se de muchos que se han quitado hasta la vida por su situación.<br>  <br>  No estamos aquí para hacer críticas destructivas, sino para ayudarnos unos a los otros, independientemente de que en la biblia se diga que son rechazados. Que le pida a Dios que le de luz y entendimiento y que le ayude a superar esa situación. Que lo pida con fe y su vida aunque siga siendo bisexual, la llevará mas tranquila lleno de paz en su corazón.<br>  <br>  Besos<br>  <br>  Alisha<br>  <br>  P.D. El caso que te cuento cercano es de un chico que ya no está vivo, pero que tenia desarrolladas más hormonas femeninas que masculinas y no era su culpa...el se murio...y sufrio mucho. Toda persona tiene hormonas femeninas y masculinas, al hombre se le desarrolla más la testosterona y a nosotras la gonadotropina es decir la hormona femenina, pero a veces esas hormonas se descontrolan. Por eso hablo con base sobre este tema y les pido a todas aquellas personas que son machistas que ABRAN SUS MENTES para poder hablar del tema sin ofensas ni criticas.

He aquí algunas:<br>  - Gén. 14:14-16 / 29:15 / Jos. 17:4 / Lev. 10:4 / 2Sam. 19:12-13 / 1Cor. 2:1 / Mt. 18:21-35, ETC.<br>  <br>  ??PASEMOS A LO DE JESúS!!: Cuando se habla de la familia de Nazaret, se mencionan SIEMPRE: "Jesús, María y José"./ NUNCA se mencionan a OTROS hermanos./ Dice la misma BIBLIA:<br>  <br>  - "Los padres de Jesús iban todos los a?os a Jerusalén para la fiesta de Pascua (Lc. 2:41).<br>  <br>  - "Se pusieron a buscarlo entre sus parientes y conocidos" (Lc. 2:44).<br>  <br>  ??DóNDE SE ECONTRABAN, PUES, LOS "HERMANOS DE JESúS??.<br>  <br>  Para NO ir tan "lejos": Tomemos en cuenta lo sucedido en la crucifixión:<br>  <br>  ??POR QUé, ANTES DE MORIR, JESúS ENTREGó SU MADRE A JUAN, QUE ERA UN EXTRA?O?? (Jn. 19:25-27).<br>  <br>  Es donde los PROTESTANTES deberían de SABER que "protestan" aún en contra de la BIBLIA, de JESúS y aún del Espíritu Santo.<br>  <br>  ??SALUDOS!!|`|20298156ded34c2936ac39263287d3f7aa	Vamos por partes: <br>  efectivamente se hace notar en los evangelios a los medio- hermanos carnales de Jesús, y en el griego esa es la palabra que emplea, no primos ni otra por el estilo. <br>  Como ya te mencionaron existen varias Marías (Miriam) que era un nombre tan común como lo es ahora.<br>  Cuando Jesus llega al tiempo de Su ense?anza se deja de hablar de José, por lo que se presume que hubiese fallecido, y tomando en cuenta que sus medio-hermanos no creyeron en él sino hasta después de Su resurrección, luego entonces se la encarga a Juan.|`|lpBsvz7Raa	yo en la escuela de catecismo le pregunte lo mismo al cura y me dijo que eran los primos de jesus ..... ja en esa epoca tenia diez a?os y no le crei!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|rIahCkamaa	Los católicos profesamos que todos los cristianos somos hermanos de Jesús en virtud de nuestro bautismo. Profesamos al mismo tiempo que Jesús no tuvo hermanos naturales. La Santísima Virgen María fue SIEMPRE VIRGEN.  <br>  <br>  Ejemplos de "hermano" utilizado para designar otras relaciones en el Antiguo Testamento: <br>      A Lot se le llama "hermano" de Abraham en Gen. 14,14, pero sabemos por la misma Biblia que era su sobrino (Gen. 11,26-28). <br>      A Jacob le llaman "hermano" de Laban quien es en realidad su tío (Gen. 29,15). <br>  <br>  <br>  "Hermanos" no tenían que ser familia cercana. <br>      Deuteronomio 23,8: "No tendrás por abominable al idumeo, porque es tu hermano" <br>       Los 42 "hermanos" del rey Ocozías que bajaban a saludar a los hijos del mismo rey y de la reina. Cf. II Reyes 10,13-14 <br>     Nehemías 5,8: "y les dije: ?Nosotros hemos rescatado, en la medida de nuestras posibilidades, a nuestros hermanos judíos que habían sido vendidos a las naciones. ?Y ahora sois vosotros! vendéis a vuestros hermanos" <br>     Jeremías 34,9: "en orden a dejar cada uno a su siervo o esclava hebreos libres dándoles la libertad de suerte que ningún judío fuera siervo de su hermano." <br>  <br>  <br>  No existe una sola sugerencia en la Biblia de que la Virgen tuviera otros hijos.<br>  Cuando la Sagrada Familia huye a Egipto, cuando se les pierde el ni?o en Jerusalén (Lucas 2:41-51), siempre se refiere a un solo hijo. Los de Nazaret, aun cuando hablan de los "hermanos" de Jesús, se refieren a El como "el hijo de María", no como "un hijo de María"(Mc 6,3). Sería este uso de palabras muy extra?o si fueran de hecho esos otros "hermanos" hijos de María.<br>  (Corazones.org)<br>  <br>  Bendiciones!.|`|0kFvpDGpaa	Marian, su respuesta es fundamentada y estoy de acuerdo con su respuesta.

"Commandments" like ones against murder, theft, etc. have been recorded by every culture, regardless of if they knew your god, so I don't see how your conclusion is justified in the slightest.<br>  <br>  EDIT: you accuse people of being immoral because they didn't drink the kool-aid like you, and then you're surprised that they give you the "attitude?"|`|rU6nh42Eaa	Morals come from a common understanding of what is right in society.  The major moral issues are ones that keep peace in society and anyone who can think straight (not mentally ill or impaired) can see that certain behavior and attitudes will help the common good or harm it.  If you look at the Ten Commandments, they were no big surprise to Moses and his people.  They knew they were true because they already knew what would happen if they went against them. I think that God puts a "moral sense" in us -- that ability to choose right actions over self-serving ones.  We don't have to believe in a god to receive that. <*)))><|`|wM7pprr1aa	Many Christians are scared by the idea that morality is a simple social construct — as opposed to being some sort of divine commandment — because it leads to the additional concept of "moral relativism". They want to believe that some (or all) morals are absolutes. In other words, "God said don't do it, so just don't do it. EVER."<br>  <br>  The truth is, all morals are relative. This should neither scare nor surprise anybody. The world is constantly changing, society is constantly changing, life is constantly changing. Advances are made in the sciences, in technology, in medicine. New knowledge is gained which did not exist before, potentially changing moral judgments. Things which were once impossible become possible. Every situation you face in life is slightly different from any other that you've faced before. This is what makes life interesting!<br>  <br>  This scares some people, but it doesn't need to be frightening at all. Except for the few sociopaths among us, everyone on the planet is quite capable of making the simple logical judgments that are required to make the moral decisions that life demands of us. As demonstrated previously, "good" and "bad" are not difficult concepts to figure out.<br>  <br>  It is true that we may disagree in certain areas what constitutes good or bad. Abortion is a perfect example of such an issue. There is almost no agreement, even among atheists, on whether abortion is a moral or immoral act. Most people believe it depends on the circumstances, and what those circumstances are will differ from person to person.<br>  <br>  That's when, as a free and democratic society, we get together and enact laws. We sit down and argue about it, and eventually reach some sort of agreement on when exactly something is good or bad (or at least, when it is permissible and not permissible; leaving the moral value judgment out of it completely). This rarely makes everyone happy; some percentage of people will feel that their particular morals are not being upheld. But it is an unspoken understanding that we have about living together in a democratic society. It's the best we can do… since there is no god coming down from on high and dictating it to us.|`|8Zey1ntAaa	Morals evolved along with us.

Z4avhg3eaa	I understand what you're upset about.  My grandmother died in 2004.  She strongly disliked church, but she had a very strong belief in God.  The minister who performed the funeral used her burial as an opportunity to proselytize--shamelessly. Not to mention that my grandmother loathed this minister.  She always thought he was sleazy.<br>  <br>  He said that the message of my grandmother's life was to repent and know the Lord today. <br>  <br>  To say that I was offended was an understatement. The only thing that stood between me, the minister, and a very nasty scene was respect for my grandfather. <br>  <br>  It's completely inappropriate to proselytize at an intimate event such as a funeral (and yes--funerals of family members are intimate).  It is an abuse of the ministerial position, an abuse of the family's trust, and an inexcusable manipulation of a person's grief.|`|mNyhRGowaa	You have seen the truth that has blossomed about the cult that your mother has fallen prey to.?

I won't mention their religion for it would only serve as a distraction to my point.  As I moved around the room, I heard the comments of many family members.  It pained me greatly to hear what these people thought had happened to his soul.  Through my eyes I felt as though I was in a room with walking dead.  They are spiritually lost.  I would have loved to be able to sit with each one and share the gospel, but it would have only repelled, not drawn anyone closer to God.  I just listened, and hugged, praying that I treated each person as Jesus would have.<br>  <br>  When a person has the truth, they also have a sensitivity for the people that need to hear the truth.

You mom will learn the truth of it all some day too, probably not until it is her time, but that's what the JW's do.  It's crazy since she's ranting about her dead mother not being in Heaven but ultimately it comes to God having the final decision and not how the JW's translate the Scriptures.  <br>  <br>  You actually still can connect with your Grandma right now and I would try to talk to her and see how it makes you feel.  You may find some peace if you do this which will cancel out all the negativity your mother is generating.<br>  <br>  My fiance's Grandpa passed away recently and I had an amazing connection with him after his passing the first time we made it over the Grandma's place.  Flashed the dining room lights per my request and all.  So what if people think I am nuts, I know what I experienced with him and he followed it through with the lights.

Nada que vaya en contra de la vida física o espiritual de un ser, vale la pena y menos algo tan atroz como la ?Santa? muerte, pues la muerte en si solo es parte de la vida y no tiene que rendirsele ningún tributo.  Seguramente para ti es duro por tu mismo trabajo el tener que enfrentarte a toda esta atrocidad, pero desdichadamente no estamos en el paraíso y cada uno cosechará al final de la vida lo que haya sembrado.  Ese bebé seguramente ya está formando parte de la santidad en el cielo, mientras los que cometieron esta barbarie están condenados.  Abrazos.

He gives resources and power to the nations, He gives authority to people so learning institutions can be established and improved. when you forget God, you become rebellious, driven by your hubris to not see your need in God.|`|BKjF5woKaa	Generally the form of 'pride' that is considered sinful in the context of the '7 deadly sins' is pride in one's self. That is, if you go about boasting to the world about how great you are.|`|IuSfCtN9aa	there are some instances that pride is good and bad. school pride is not bad. team pride is not also bad. feeling pride coz of winning is not a sin.|`|612f63e9175a526652c97a470fd55b3faa	Generally speaking no.  However, it (like anything else) can become an idol.  At which point yes.<br>  <br>  It becomes an idol when it takes first place in your list of priorities.  |`|FsByX9xxaa	I really dont care.

It is a somewhat familiar list; here they are: Pride, Covetousness, Lust, Anger, Envy, Gluttony, and Sloth (or laziness). Not a Biblical list, but a classical grouping probably assembled by some Medieval theologians. The purpose was not to identify all sin, but to identify the root attitudes of all sin. You will notice that those seven sins, called the "Seven Deadly Sins," are not actions--they are attitudes: Pride, Covetousness, Lust, Anger, Envy, Gluttony, and Laziness, those will issue in certain words and certain actions. But those, theologians thought, were sort of the things that were underlying human sinful behavior.<br>  <br>  There is a good kind of anger. Jesus got angry. There 's a good kind of pride - the kind you mention. Laziness & gluttony is relative - it means different things to different people. Etc, etc.|`|2de0b79e82da7f529f88b7bd06230c4faa	- There are two kinds of pride, one's Healthy & one's bad. It is good to take pride in your work, school, team, etc. Bad however being prideful, pride is what got the devil kicked out of Heaven. Some say that low self esteem (Pride) is bad, But, it's strange that usually those with the Utmost are in Prisons.|`|f3byX86eaa	There is a difference between taking pride in what you do or things like your country and school and the Pride of what you speak.  This is a selfish pride that results in one thinking they are better than others or more important than someone else. |`|5e5aec03a0919c712548d067b9f5b488aa	don't try, you can't convince them. magic is reality in their lala land|`|AA12346187	pride in yourself is a sin    I am  not so sure  about   an organization  if you are proud  because  you were there then yes.|`|3DjUX8etaa	The seven deadly sins were a creation of the Catholic Church. It is not Biblical to say the least. But to answer your question, pride itself is not a sin. Only when pride leads to actions that cause a person to take their eyes off God does it become sinful. So I would say that it is definitely not a sin in your case.  +?+|`|GJS3hTK5aa	When we celebrate our victory, it should not hurt others. You have the right to celebrate your triumphs, but it should never hurt the person who lost. You must win his heart as well and he should also feel happy to join your celebrations though he has lost to you. Such should be our attitude in our life in every sphere. If you have even little bit of pride, it will not let you to see the mind of the other person. Take out pride from your life which will only hurt others. Happiness and celebrations need not be associated with pride. Pride is wrong everywhere.|`|a62b895e23928e2555a83a605626c900aa	Yes, and No .  Being proud of an accomplishment is okay .

so5CCmmJaa	I think we have a lot less free will than most people think. I believe much of our behavior is either hard wired into us, or the result of physics...even though it feels like we are making our decisions, could just be the result of all the physical things interacting in the universe without us being able to control it.<br>  <br>  No real way to tell.|`|bmk7XMYZaa	You are correct It is somewhat of a misconception in fact. You may do as you please TO A POINT and then the "free will" is gone. <br>  <br>  Eventually you are set on a predestined path and manipulated by what can only be termed as "unseen" forces that use every form of manipulation from sound and audio manipulations, to dream and thought invasion. <br>  <br>  Of course they have also established "people" on the planet with their B.S. accreditations, in the form of doctors and psychologists, to dismiss all recognition of such manipulations as "psychosis."<br>  <br>  It is a divisive game at best this "free will."|`|veB7gJYcaa	Look at it this way<br>  <br>  God is the conductor of the train.<br>  <br>  We can either get on the train and be in the loving arms of Jesus.<br>  <br>  Or we can let the train  pass us by.<br>  <br>  All Aboard!<br>  The train is getting ready to leave the station.<br>  <br>  God has alot more to do with peoples lives than they realize.|`|wIDfvJyRaa	i believe that you are saying that their is nothing called free will only destiny. to an extent i also believe that we are born with a destiny but we can change our destiny by using free will. so yes in my opinion free will exists.|`|K2mXhSGlaa	If free-will doesn't exist, your question would not have materialized.<br>  <br>  EDIT: "Personally I think".... seems you might have contradicted yourself, with all due respect.|`|YHmr7nvsaa	Yes.|`|2de0b79e82da7f529f88b7bd06230c4faa	  - It's our Will & it's Free . . . |`|wYF5gSoXaa	its your free will not to believe in it|`|Ya4jDBhEaa	I do not wake up daily with an overwhelming force that I am helpless to making me do all kinds of things good and evil as if I was simply a robotic entity.

He said in Deut.30:19 that he sets before you life and death, blessing and cursing, therefore you choose life.<br>            What upsets most people about God is that when they choose death and the curse through sin actions, and when those words and actions bring sickness or poverty or depression, they get mad at God for "letting it happen."Most of some peoples lives are spent not giving God the time of day, then when catrastrophy happens, it becomes an act of God.We  all have the freedom to choose our words, our thoughts, and our actions. God will protect your right to speak, think and do anything you choose to do. He doesn' come down here and slap that cigarette out of your mouth even though he knows that it is killing you. Because you are absolutely free to choose.All of Gods commandments are for your good. He isn't against you having fun, he is against death. If you are getting lifes enjoyment out of breathing smoke on purpose, you are shortchanging yourself, not God.Or any other intellegent things we do. Like drinking alchohol.You can burn that stuff in lanterns, and men drink it on purpose. Or eating 30 twinkies a day. All self destructive behavior.<br>          Or homosexuality or lying, or stealing, or hate and fear. God says all these things will bring destruction. |`|8YUtmEU7aa	To say free will doesn't exist at all, seems counterintuitive.

hR7OsqtRaa	2 Timothy 3:16<br>  All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1:11-12<br>  I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up. I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)<br>  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)<br>  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)<br>  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)<br>  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)<br>  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21<br>  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)<br>  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.<br>  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a>

C8gLsP3Taa	Yes, Satan is a master at counterfeiting the Lord.  One of his masterpieces of counterfeiting God was in the dream or vision he gave to Eliphaz to instruct Job concerning his trials.  In the dream Satan posed as God; but, the deception was that the advice and false accusations did not apply to Job.  Follow with me Eliphaz’s dream  (See Job 4:12,13, and 16.), “Now a thing was secretly brought to me…In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men.  Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:  It stood still…an image was before mine eyes, and I heard a voice saying.” <br>  <br>   The following is the advice to Job from the dream.  “I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:”  (5:8).  “He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the forward is carried headlong.”  (5:13)<br>  <br>  Job answers: “To him (Job) that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend…My brethren have dealt deceitfully...”  (6:14,15).<br>  <br>   Eliphaz to Job:  “For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.  Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify against thee:”<br>  <br>   Job answers Eliphaz:  “But he (God) knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.  My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.”  (23:10,11).<br>  <br>  Now God rebukes Eliphaz for applying Satan’s dream to Job in Chapter 42, Verses 7,8,  “…the Lord said unto Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.”  “Therefore…go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering: and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job.”<br>  <br>  You should read the whole account for yourself.  Satan deceived Eliphaz into thinking he (Satan) was God, applying his (Satan’s) words to Job, which scenario God had nothing to do with.  God harshly rebuked Eliphaz for being deceived by Satan and perpetrating his lie to Job.  <br>  <br>   Visions and dreams are deceptive; but, God’s word is always true.  In John 14:6, Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the father, but by me (Christ).”<br>  |`|iMGgBH5jaa	Satan can do whatever he wants! muahahahahahahahahaha!|`|7J69CQvTaa	Can the spaghetti monster deceive us by tricking us into buying bad pasta sauce?|`|14b43c5bae3d09bf80336812c8aece34aa	He especially likes to use visions and dreams.|`|52LK8tpLaa	He doesn't have power over our thoughts, we control them.

The top answer to why there must be a god is because the world is too complex to have been created by a long series of small events.  Well you've identified the response to that.<br>  <br>  There's no answer.|`|xu99sLRCaa	Yep|`|AA10945101	You're basically describing a paradox...and logically, it is absolutely possible that the "idea of a god" is the original paradox!<br>  <br>  Thing is, I think it is a waste of time to try to resolve this particular paradox because no human being has any hope of doing so.  God made it clear on more than one occasion that our greatest wisdom is foolishness in his eyes...that so many aspects of his nature and his plan are beyond our ability to even imagine! ...and even if you don't accept the bible as God's word, it just doesn't make sense to think that we could understand a creator with the power to create everything we see and everything we are when we don't have the knowledge or power to even replicate his creation (let alone create a competitive universe from scratch...without using what he already created as a blueprint)!<br>  <br>  Yes, I've heard this argument...and I think it is pointless...because it is based on an irrational premise.  People that use the "a universe this complex must require a creator" argument are obviously under the impression that the complexity of this universe constitutes evidence of the existence of God AND that if they can convince someone else to accept that evidence, that person will also decide to believe. ...but I think the bible makes it clear that is just doesn't work that way!  The irrational premise is similar to what I said above...it assumes that evidence is the foundation for faith...the bible makes it clear that faith is the foundation for evidence!  <br>  <br>  The most rational argument for faith is this...if there is a God, no human being on earth can claim to be his equal on any level.  As such, it is irrational to assume that a human being has the ability to EVER acquire enough knowledge (or anything else) to disprove the existence of God.  Faith built on evidence is like a house built on a foundation of quicksand...every new bit of evidence causes the person to reconsider the decision to believe...in other words, they continue to experience concern that they made the wrong decision...psychologists would call this cognitive dissonance!  <br>  <br>  Faith is a choice to believe without regard to evidence...it accepts that any evidence we could collect about God is inherrently biased and often wildly inaccurate and instead views the ultimate outcome as unknowable.  ..and when a rational human is faced with a choice between two options when the probability of each being true can't be determined "a priori" (beforehand), he or she will make the choice by evaluating the expected value (benefits minus costs) of making a correct AND an incorrect choice. Do this with the basic question...does God exist...and the "idea of a god" becomes a lot more than possible...it becomes the only rational choice! |`|DA53AFKhaa	With that thinking there would eventually have to be an original creator, that i God, Alpha and Omega, beginning and end, he is infinity and eternity. |`|ggLDJ08gaa	Well where I stand is that god is everything and yes he's complex but easy to understand if your open-minded enough here's one for ya...God is eternity, time, alpha and the omega almighty creator of heaven and earth as in he created everything and has been around forever making there no real beginning to it all so it's kinda like a circle goes round and round and never stops....if it still doesn't make sense then umm think about it this way is there another explanation for how we got here I mean think about it though no one animal is the same but if you saw one of them and it was switched with a different one that was the same size would you be able to tell...my guess is probably not...but see humans are different in that respect because if I took a human and showed him/her to you and replaced him/her with someone else either male for male or female for female would you be able to tell the difference fairly easily...my guess is definitely...the only exception would be something like twins but that's really it or triplets and etc but most all people can be separated in their own group because of the many obvious things about them and how else would such differential features in each person come about without the creator one and only.  |`|mFaHJE9gaa	Yes it is puzzling isn't it.

The most important truth that God revealed to mankind is that there is nothing divine or worthy of being worshipped except for Almighty God, thus all human beings should submit to Him.<br>  A Hijab is a word that indicated the following conditions :<br>  <br>  7 Conditions For a Woman's Dress<br>  <br>  <br>  1. Clothing must cover the entire body, only the hands and face may remain visible (According to some Fiqh Schools) . <br>  <br>  2. The material must not be so thin that one can see through it. <br>  <br>  3. The clothing must hang loose so that the shape / form of the body is not apparent. <br>  <br>  4. The female clothing must not resemble the man's clothing. <br>  <br>  5. The design of the clothing must not resemble the clothing of the non believing women. <br>  <br>  6. The design must not consist of bold designs which attract attention. <br>  <br>  7. Clothing should not be worn for the sole purpose of gaining reputation or increasing one's status in society. <br>  <br>  The reason for this strictness is so that the woman is protected from the lustful gaze of men. She should not attract attention to herself in any way. It is permissible for a man to catch the eye of a woman , however it is haram (unlawful) for a man to look twice as this encourages lustful thoughts. <br>  <br>  Islam protects the woman, it is for this reason that Allah gave these laws. In today's society womankind is being exploited, female sexuality is being openly used in advertising, mainly to attract the desires of men and therefore sell the product. Is the woman really free in today's society ? The answer is obviously no, the constant bombardment by the media as to how the ideal woman should look and dress testifies to this. <br>  <br>  Islam liberated woman over 1400 years ago. Is it better to dress according to man or God ? <br>  <br>  Allah has stated in the Quran that women must guard their modesty. <br>  <br>  " Say to the believing women that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty ; that they should not display their beauty and ornaments except what must ordinarily appear thereof. " [Quran : 24.31]<br>  <br>  " Say to the believing man that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty ; that will make for greater purity for them, and God is well aquatinted with all they do. " [Quran : 24.30]<br>  <br>  " And O ye believers turn ye all together toward God, so that ye may attain bliss. " [Quran : 24.31]<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  sister Allah is one & Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) is the messanger of Allah....<br>  Sister islam is a true Religion....Be Muslim ,Inshallah you will see how you life will change after you accept islam the true Religion .....<br>  <br>  Sister say la ilah illa allah(there is nothing to worship other than Allah)<br>  <br>  & say Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) is the messanger of Allah....|`|OtKCAeQZaa	The  true and living god, the man that has been seen upon this earth is Jesus Christ. when we pray we pray to our heavenly Father and we close in the name of Jesus Christ.

Its a fiction created by various priests in various religions to act as a sort of carrot and stick mechanism to force the populace to toe their line.<br>  2. Its real, and as you say is a point scoring game between the god figure and the devil figure, at which point we are just counters in the game.  It also implies some sort of parity of power between the two, which I'm sure the priests would disagree with, saying the their god is much more powerful than their devil.<br>  Which leaves as number:<br>  3. The good and supremely powerful god is sufficiently childish and petty that he sets up a system where we are placed in a game for which we have several possible rules books, dependant largely on where we are born, and in which, if we happen to read the wrong rulebook through no fault of our own, we may well have to pay by suffering horrendous pain throughout eternity.

First of all, Muslims believe and love all Prophets including Jesus, they believe though in the Prophet Muhammad being the last of them. We are ordered in the Quran to believe in all Prophets. If a muslim believes in Prophet Muhammed but denies Jesus, then he will enter hell. We deny the Trinity because its nonsense. There is only One God(Allah), and anyone who associates Allah with anything will end up in hell. Jesus never ever claimed himself in the ORIGINAL BIBL that he was God or even the Son of God. As it says in the Quran: "And (remember) when Allah will say (on the day of Resurrection): "O Jesus, son of Mary! did you say unto men: Worship me and my mother as two gods besides Allah?" He will say: "Glory is to You! It was not for me to say what I had no right (to say). Had I said such a thing, You would surely, have known it. You know what is in my inner-self though I do not know what is in Yours; truly, You, only You, are the All-Knower of all that is hidden. "Never did I say to them aught except what You(Allah) did command me to say: 'Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.' And I was a witness over them while I dwelt amongst them, but when You took me up, You were the Watcher over them; and You are a Witness to all things.Quran 5: 116-117 The problem is men have been changing and revising the bible so much to the point where there is over 70 versions, some even contradicting each other. Whereas there is one version of the Quran with no contradictions at all.  Second of all, if you read the Quran, it says that if anyone ever kills an innocent life without reason, it is as if he has killed all of mankind and will then enter hell. Allah orders us to kill those unbelievers who attack you first. So please make sure you know Islam before you talk about it.|`|FFqWeIX7aa	Do you think Muslims are going to Heaven? <br>  - Of course, If God will.<br>  <br>  Considering Islam denies the trinity and Jesus who "self-proclaimed" himself as the "Son of God" in his teachings, do you think they will still be allowed to go to heaven? <br>  - Did Jesus ever proclaim himself as "God"? Or Church invented the concept that Jesus as God, like the Pagan Roman Religion<br>  <br>  Also Islam teaches hate and allows you to rise up and kill unbelievers...to me that is nothing God would want. <br>  - Muslim are really pious and devoted to their religion. <br>  <br>  If that it is Islamic teaching and order from God, don't you ever think that Christian should already been diminished from the world 1000 years ago, where they completely dominates world?<br>  <br>  btw, Bible is filled with hatred and war and killings more than al-Quran. Read OT.<br>  <br>  God is our creator and it is not up to us to take the lives of others just because they don't live or believe in the same way as they do. I don't think they are but am curious to others opinions. Also, why are muslims so beligerent about religion and conversations about religion?<br>  - Is it? I'm Muslim. I read Bible twice, and I found that Trinity never exist. Christian are too close minded with their Churchly dogmas until they divided so.<br>  <br>  They are so close minded...why? <br>  - Christian are sooo closed minded.

We can't hate anyone. It will only darken our hearts. When it says kill the unbelievers, its not those who believes in other religion, but those who go out of the way to condemn Allah. In fact, that is the last option that Islam want muslims to do. Other than that, muslims are told to respect and be kind to everyone no matter wat race or religion or status they are. <br>  Those muslims who are close minded are only a few percent out of the whole muslim community. Its not fair to jusge the whole family based on 1 black sheep is it? Personnally, as a muslim myself, i don't always agree when other muslim use violence just so their message is heard. But then again, I was never in their shoe.
FMzZQojGaa	I think people reject God because they are scared of what it means to accept God.  I know from experience, that accepting God was scary for me but that I have, my only regret is that I didn't accept him earlier in my life.  God doesn't want you to reject him, and he will ease you when its time to accept.  I know how great it was when I accepted him.  I still see today that great blessings he continues to give me daily.  I was lost for over 30 yrs and I know God has knocked on my heart several times but I kept turning him because I thought giving into God was ending all the fun in my life but it actually doesn't mean that at all it just lets you have fun without getting into trouble.

Atheism must therefore be regarded as one of the most serious problems of our time.<br>  <br>  The name "atheism" covers many very different phenomena. One common form is the practical materialism which restricts its needs and aspirations to space and time. Atheistic humanism falsely considers man to be "an end to himself, and the sole maker, with supreme control, of his own history."Another form of contemporary atheism looks for the liberation of man through economic and social liberation. "It holds that religion, of its very nature, thwarts such emancipation by raising man's hopes in a future life, thus both deceiving him and discouraging him from working for a better form of life on earth."<br>  <br>  Since it rejects or denies the existence of God, atheism is a sin against the virtue of religion.The imputability of this offense can be significantly diminished in virtue of the intentions and the circumstances. "Believers can have more than a little to do with the rise of atheism. To the extent that they are careless about their instruction in the faith, or present its teaching falsely, or even fail in their religious, moral, or social life, they must be said to conceal rather than to reveal the true nature of God and of religion."<br>  <br>  Atheism is often based on a false conception of human autonomy, exaggerated to the point of refusing any dependence on God.Yet, "to acknowledge God is in no way to oppose the dignity of man, since such dignity is grounded and brought to perfection in God. . . .

yHfsHp6naa	No, God can't even exist.|`|yQNit56Qaa	1) Could God be married or parents?<br>  <br>  I vote for "parents".  Parents could be married.  It seems extremely unlikely that God could be married.<br>  <br>  <br>  2) could he be married or have parents?<br>  <br>  Well, you mention a Scriptural definition of God (created in his image).  Since this is the case, Scripture is clear that he is neither married nor does he have parents.<br>  <br>  <br>  3) he has to be married<br>  <br>  Why?  People don't "have to be married".  If we are in God's image, what makes you think he *must* be married?<br>  <br>  As for parents - God is the creator of *all*.  He is the "alpha".  That is, indeed, one of the primary characteristics of the Scriptural God - all that exists except himself was created by him, who is the first "thing."<br>  <br>  <br>  4) why would he make us do stuff if he isn't willing or hasn't done it before?<br>  <br>  ?  Why not?  Are you telling me that you only want people to do the things that you, yourself have done?  If you never made a pair of shoes, then you don't want anyone making shoes?  If you never wired a house, then you don't want anyone to have electricity in their homes?<br>  <br>  <br>  5) do we not become perfected when we find our better half.<br>  <br>  No.  Logically, what would make you think that we would become so?<br>  <br>  <br>  6) I would love Logical proof in the scriptures to state we follow different rules then God<br>  <br>  v 9<br>  <a href="http://www.studybibleforum.com/htm_php.php3?do=jump_to_chapter&refstr=1+Tim+1%3A9&trans=NASB" rel="nofollow">http://www.studybibleforum.com/htm_php.p...</a><br>  The Law (that is, Mosaic Law, the law of God) was not made for the righteous...<br>  <br>  v 4<br>  <a href="http://www.studybibleforum.com/htm_php.php3?do=jump_to_chapter&refstr=Deut+32%3A4&trans=NASB" rel="nofollow">http://www.studybibleforum.com/htm_php.p...</a><br>  We see that God, by comparison, is faithful, just, righteous and upright.<br>  <br>  Therefore - clearly - the Mosaic Law (for example) was not made for God.

Clearly, though, you can see that the Laws were made for the Jews as part of the covenant.  The covenant does *not* indicate that God must adhere to the Mosaic Law - it dictates *specifically* that the Jews - and those who live under their rule - must adhere to the Mosaic Law.  God's part in the covenant is to bless the Jews as described as long as they are faithful to the regulations and to God, and to curse the Jews as described when they are not faithful to the regulations and to God.

jRcdbna5aa	A lot more then you would imagine, actually.  The problem is, you're viewing this from the point of view that 1) God exists and 2) Christianity is true.  In your mind, if one rejects these two views, then, obviously, they must be angry or bitter.<br>  <br>  The way you should look at this is from our point of view: There is no evidence to support the existence of the supernatural.  As such, there is no reason to be bitter at anything supernatural, including your god, the gods of the ancient Greeks, or anything else supernatural.<br>  <br>  As for being anti-Christian, that's a different story, and you're still looking at it wrong.  One could be bitter a your god, and still like Christians.  One could dislike Christians, but still like your god.  One concept does not have to include the others.<br>  <br>  The truth of the matter is, at least for me, as well as for many of the atheists I associate with, is that we don't hate Christians.  There are individual Christians we don't like, much in the same way that there are probably individuals you don't care for.  The religion of these individuals is secondary  to whether we like the person or not.  <br>  <br>  For myself, I don't have an issue with any Christian in my circle of associates because of their religion.  My wife is Christian, and I get along with her just fine.  On the flip side, there is a Christian at work that I dislike, but again, it's because of that person's personality, not because of their faith.<br>  <br>  I've learned over the past 35 years that it's a bad idea to judge people based on their religion.  Each individual is different, and I judge them based on their actions.  If someone is a decent person in action, then I consider them a decent person based on their actions, regardless of what they believe.  If someone is not a decent person in action, I consider them to be not decent based on their actions, regardless of their beliefs.|`|FI916ISFaa	Your level of trolling has fallen substantially.|`|C1SOqQSkaa	Is that the London Symphony Orchestra?|`|AA10556726	It's tough to be bitter at imaginary beings but it can be done.

Once upon a time, people "believed" the world was flat, even as they had no evidence of it being either.|`|FKN8Rmu6aa	Bitter at god? That's like saying I'm bitter at the tooth fairy or Santa clause. Really I can't feel anything for something that is not real. just like I don't care when TV characters die in a good show on the tube.Even though they seem more real then god does.  I am on the other hand ANTI-IDIOT. That would include FOOLS of all religious backgrounds. Most dangerously offensive are the particular morons called "Christians". They whine and babble about some totally mythological dead guy on a stick, and some loose girl who cheated on her husband, then blamed "god" for the pregnancy. But really what gets me about them is their constant pushing of this garbage in public. Trying to legislate their morality and even so far as to want their silly, unscientific ideas of creation taught in school. That offends me to the point of wanting to do violence to them. Harming my children with this bull or in anyway removing the truth from their education, really lights me up. <br>  So in short I am ANTI- YOU.<br>  ... and a nice thought for the day is:<br>  If you and your fellow Jesus morons where wiped from the face of the earth, it would be a better place.|`|2VFR5AKHaa	Iso anti christian?

j1Yae2q9aa	As a foreigner, you would be praised if you showed that you knew how to write in kana.  It would probably be deemed acceptable to just use kana, but if you decide to live there, or stay abroad, then learning kanji is certainly a must.  There is a mixture of katakana, hiragana, and kanji in Japan, but they will use kanji wherever they can.  Don't worry though, although there are about 2,000 kanji to remember, once you get passed 50 or so, they become easier to learn, and you'll eventually see some logic with more complex kanji.  ie: Fire + Mountain = volcano.<br>  <br>  If you were to live, stay abroad, people will think that you are of an uneducated class, and look down on you.  But you need not to worry. I do strongly recommend that you begin learning Kanji, with both on and kun readings.  Go by level, and hopefully within 2-years, you'll learn all the kanji you will ever need.|`|7f19096dfc203109750db707ef0faeedaa	Acceptable to whom? It is not normally done by the Japanese, as Japanese is written in a combination of katakana, hiragana and kanji. Writing entirely in hiragana shows that you don't know any kanji and apparently never graduated from high school. But for a foreigner studying Japanese, I don't think anyone will criticize you.

In the Roman Empire there were many slaves, not just ***** slaves but white slaves. These were persons who had been taken captive in war or who had fallen into debt and could not pay. So numerous were the slaves that a Roman citizen could have as many as four thousand slaves in his establishment. Many of them heard the preaching of the good news of God’s kingdom of freedom and accepted Christianity. In spite of being slaves to some rich or powerful man or woman, they believed in the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ and dedicated themselves to Jehovah God. Did God refuse their dedication and say that they could not make such a dedication because they were not free to do so? Did God say they were subject to a slaveholder and were owned by him and could not give themselves completely to God and undertake a dedication to Him?<br>  19 No! God did not refuse their dedication through Christ. Had God refused it, then the Christian congregation would not have admitted slaves. But God did accept their dedication and let them into the congregation of his holy people. That is why the apostles of Jesus Christ recognized these dedicated slaves as members of the congregation and wrote about how they should act as Christians.<br>  20 Well, then, when God accepted their dedication and made these slaves members of His congregation, did this free them from their earthly owners? Not at all. They remained earthly slaves, although they had now gained a spiritual freedom that undedicated, non-Christian slaves did not enjoy. “For anyone in the Lord that was called when a slave is the Lord’s freedman,” said Paul, meaning it in a spiritual way and not encouraging a slave to make a breakaway.<br>  21 That is why Paul said: “In whatever state each one was called [to be a holy one of God], let him remain in it. Were you called when a slave? Do not let it worry you; but if you can also become free, rather seize the opportunity. .?.?. likewise he that was called when a free man is a slave of Christ. You were bought with a price [of Christ’s sacrifice]; stop becoming slaves of men. In whatever condition each one was called, brothers, let him remain in it associated with God.” (1?Cor. 7:20-24) Paul was no reformer of the Roman Empire, and he was not authorized by God to be such. Why should he be, when he and God knew that the unholy Roman Empire was to be destroyed in God’s due time? The widespread slavery in the Roman Empire was enforced by the imperial government. Paul subjected himself to the existing Roman government in this matter|`|LQsh261waa	Stay doing what God specifically told you to do, what you were born to do and are good at it.

I have seen many things and know if you ask God to show you he will, Jesus says seek me with all your heart and you will find me, Jesus is the way the truth and the life, his around, his with us, some of us have veils over our eyes so even when his there we don't see him, if you ask him to remove the veil you will see things you never thought possible, Bless you. |`|44cd283169fb972cb9a8006a9ecce2d1aa	Kiko,<br>  I had a Near-Death Experience and feel that was as close to meeting GOD as anyone will ever get.

I had felt god in life  but reading this verse i felt god so much more.Job 3:19 The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master. I took this to mean that on earth we are free from him. Have i seen him in form? NO, yet the vengeance taken upon the guys in relation to my sister, maybe he did deliver vengeance through  me. But I doubt that. I repented and left the church after all how could god love me? Yet even all these years on, Job 3:19 still comes out. Interesting dreams that wake me at 0319, Anyone around me opening up a bible randomly will open to that section.

SO it is not contradictory..it is redundant.|`|61wMfK9Uaa	Women are less dominant, but definately more aggressive.<br>  <br>  As much as you and half the population hate it, men are dominant on this planet.<br>  <br>  Women were formerly less dominant and less aggressive. That has since changed when women began taking what they wanted in an attempt to become dominant. Women are ON THE WAY to becoming dominant.

WPratgUYaa	I take it you mean Irish Gaelic? Or perhaps Scots Gaelic?<br>  The thing is, there are no symbols for certain words in Irish or Scots Gaelic. Both modern versions are written in the Latin script.<br>  If you are referring to Celtic designs, such as knots, they don't usually have any meanings. They were simply works of art with no attached meaning. Some people say there are meanings for different designs but they are probably lying so that you part with your money quicker.<br>  If ever there were meanings for each Celtic design, they are now lost in history, and we will never know what they mean.<br>  <br>  If you want the Irish words for "father and son",<br>  it's "athair agus mac".
YimkX6Tzaa	Concerning the resurrection of the dead, God says, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob". (Matthew 22:31-32) Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob had been physically dead for many years. God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. So evidently there is life after death.<br>  <br>  Yet Paul confidently says, that to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord (2 Corinthians 5:8), and thus we shall always be with the Lord. (1 Thessalonians 4:17) But the wicked shall be punished with everlasting destruction (spiritual destitution) from the presence of the Lord. (2 Thessalonians 1:7) Paul desired to depart for the closer presence of Christ.

Would a God who takes such care with unborn babies, who clearly loves them, also be okay with someone sucking that baby out and tossing it aside like so much garbage?|`|VWvI5RyBaa	On that one, though I'm very religious, I have to disagree.  OH!  I can feel the darts of some people reading.  I agree with it when a mother would die if she stays pregnant.  What is better, losing one life or losing two lives?  If that woman has children home, don't they need their mother?  I believe God is Love and understanding and since the baby wouldn't survive if the mother dies, then it's better to save one life and possibly the lives of her other children who are waiting for her at home.|`|HOQp0gA7aa	I would think that depends on the religion of the person in question.

Besides this, do you know how cruel the abortion procedures are?  They literally inject a solution into the womb that burns and breaks apart the baby-a human life and then use a suction to suck out of the womb the body parts.  Or if that is not enough for you sometimes they use a sharp object to make a hole in the back of the babies head and suck the brains out.  No matter what the circumstances are of the pregnancy, aborting a child is morally wrong.  A baby is an innocent life that didn't make the choice to be brought into the world, if you don't want the baby give it up for adoption to someone that does...but please don't consider murdering it!!|`|BHRHf367aa	Anyone, religious or not has the freedom to choose to end a life, steal, commit adultery, etc (Ecclesiastes.12:13), but we should know there are consequences to our actions. God does not stop the hands of people who serve from sinning (which abortion is regardless of circumstance), David, Moses, Jacob, Abraham all sinned, they had the freedom to do so, God does not ever hinder freedom. I cannot tell you per se not to have one as a religious person, I can only give you the facts, and plead with you as God does-Choose life!|`|lcyV3WHAaa	You will not find anything relating to abortion directly in the bible, as it was not something that could be done back in those days. <br>  <br>  There are plenty of verses about murder, such as the 10 commandments "Thou shalt not murder", but you will not find any scripture to link one to another, and this will always come down to morals and beliefs.<br>  <br>  In the end, the person/people making the decisions should discuss this with God, with other people (friends, family, medical personnel, church members/leaders, etc). We all have to answer to God for our actions, and we have to ask whether we are doing something for God, or for ourselves. <br>  <br>  I don't think there is an absolute answer for this, individuals need to speak with God and determine what He wishes for them to do.|`|qmsgEJIwaa	There are billions of abortions every year. We would have a really overcrowded planet if this was not the case. I think no one in the world knows what is right or wrong, whether there is a god or no god, whether an abortion is just fate, whether the woman has no control over her choices. I mean seriously there are really no answers. Just be as good a person as you can. If you have an abortion and it is indeed wrong, you really weren't experienced enough in life to know any better. There is forgiveness and for those that think it is wrong, you are guilty of being judgemental. Let's start living and give people a break.|`|a27RHZaAaa	It's a good idea to take responsibility for our own actions. If we acted to get a child so.........in that way adoption becomes a good option.<br>  Vedic scriptures which teach karma and reincarnation say that after death you will enter a womb and be aborted, not once but thousands of times if you abort a fetus. Apparently one may be able to lessen that effect by loving God now and begging His forgiveness.|`|9DW9irIGaa	one that comes to mind is, "for you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb. i praise you because i am fearfully and wonderfully made... my frame was not hidden from you when i was made in the secret place. when i was woven together in [the womb], your eyes saw my unformed body." and the clincher: "all my days were written in your book before one of them came to be!"

God could not look upon the sins of man, this is why this happened. <br>  Mary had to be pure, She was created for this, and God would not be put in a sinful soul. He is Almighty and All Pure. This was God's plan an no one else's. When you say Pure in heart, yes She was. She never looked at a man directly in the face, for fear of thinking something sinful. She avoided sin at all cost. The most perfect human being ever created, God's Queen, yes Queen! When you are called home what are you going to say to Jesus when He asks, Why did you not ask My Mother for help. Didn't you know She was the apple of His eye. His treasure, His Precious Mother, Who He would never let anybody defame. She was pure when She brought Him into this world, She was pure when She raised and protected Him, And She was pure when She was carried over the veil, Body and Soul and crown by the Most Holy Trinity, God.<br>  Do not take shots at my faith, it is unbecoming to you all.

Mary is NOT a Queen, and I'm not 100% why they call her that. Mary is not pure, either. Everyone is sinful except Jesus! Also, in Genesis where it says a woman will crush satan. It says 'descendant', which is Jesus. |`|oxuWY91Xaa	she takes it|`|c9f625014526b2fcf9fa720e01fcd413aa	It is a story, they can make a character exactly as they deem fit when they write a story.<br>  It really is not necessary to believe it.|`|zUMvC6QEaa	The "splendor of an entirely unique holiness" by which Mary is " enriched from the first instant of her conception" comes wholly from Christ : She is redeemed, in a more exalted fashion, by reason of the merits of her Son. The Father blessed Mary more than any other created person in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places and chose her in Christ before the foundation of the world, to be holy and blameless before him in love. (Eph. 1:3-4) Mary is the most excellent fruit of redemption. She was totally preserved from the stain of original sin and she remained pure from all personal sin throughout  her life.

That is why heaven has banished sex from everyone. You are forever cursed to walk like the angels, if you even make it into heaven. If those eyes do not dame you to hell. God has a hidden way with the eyes where you see only one woman. Not the many with those prowling eyes. Christians will often fight with me on this wisdom. I say God did not create this orgy sickness you guys call sexual language. I desire my wife all to myself and that is with the eyes also. The flesh gives you many with this world and nothing real.

It is quoted in Christian beliefs (the Bible) that Jesus said to his followers that "does not the rain fall equally on the Jews and the gentile" and I believe He is saying that regardless of your belief system, we should respect it.  We may not follow that particular belief system ourselves, but we can honor your belief system.  The way one might re-quote it is: "Your belief system works for you, but it wouldn't work for me".  Even Buddha said that each of us should question everything with our own experiences, even Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, Jewish, whatever, even whirling dervish's, and judged against those beliefs, judge it.  If it appears valid, then accept it, if not, do not accept it.  Even after you have accepted it, do not cling to it.<br>  And don't have count of those who ridicule you with ridiculous and sarcastic answers, it was a good question for you to ask.  Always, dear one, always question everything.  Its the only way you grow in your spiritual journey and mature.<br>  Good luck on your journey.

So it began to say to the woman: “Is it really so that God said YOU must not eat from every tree of the garden?” 2 At this the woman said to the serpent: “Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat. 3 But as for [eating] of the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the garden, God has said, ‘YOU must not eat from it, no, YOU must not touch it that YOU do not die.’” 4 At this the serpent said to the woman: “YOU positively will not die. 5 For God knows that in the very day of YOUR eating from it YOUR eyes are bound to be opened and YOU are bound to be like God, KNOWING good and bad.” 6 Consequently the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was something to be longed for to the eyes, yes, the tree was desirable to look upon. So she began taking of its fruit and eating it. Afterward she gave some also to her husband when with her and he began eating it.<br>  <br>  As to Adam’s being perfect, read Genesis 1:27, 31 and Deuteronomy 32:4. When Jehovah God pronounced his earthly creation, including man and woman, to be “very good,” what did it mean? For One whose activity is perfect to have said that what he made was “very good,” it must have measured up to his perfect standards.<br>  <br>  Did perfection require that Adam and Eve be unable to do wrong? The maker of a robot expects it to do exactly what he has programmed it to do. But a perfect robot would not be a perfect human. The qualities viewed as essential are not the same. Adam and Eve were humans, not robots. To humankind, God gave the ability to choose between right and wrong, between obedience and disobedience, to make moral decisions. Since this is the way humans were designed, the inability to make such decisions (and not an unwise decision) is what would have indicated imperfection.—Compare Deuteronomy 30:19, 20; Joshua 24:15.<br>  <br>  For Adam and Eve to qualify as being created perfect, must all their decisions thereafter be right? That would be the same as saying that they had no choice. But God did not make them in such a way that their obedience would be automatic. God granted them the ability to choose, so that they could obey because they loved him. Or, if they allowed their hearts to become selfish, they would become disobedient. Which means more to you—when someone does something for you because he is forced to do it or because he wants to?—Compare Deuteronomy 11:1; 1 John 5:3.<br>  <br>  How could such perfect humans become selfish, leading to acts of sin? Although created perfect, their physical bodies would not continue to function perfectly if not provided with proper food. So, too, if they let the mind feed on wrong thoughts, this would cause moral deterioration, unholiness. James 1:14, 15 explains: “Each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed by his own desire. Then the desire, when it has become fertile, gives birth to sin.” In the case of Eve, the wrong desires began to develop when she listened with interest to Satan, who used a serpent as his mouthpiece. Adam heeded the urging of his wife to join her in eating the forbidden fruit. Instead of rejecting the wrong thoughts, both nourished selfish desires. Acts of sin resulted.—Gen. 3:1-6.

To aid him in his quest, Jesus was given the ability to perform miracles. These included speaking from the cradle, curing the blind and the lepers, as well as raising the dead; all by the permission of God. Furthermore, Jesus was helped by a band of disciples (the ?awāriyūn). Islam states that Jesus was not killed nor crucified by the Jews, but that he had been raised alive up to heaven. Islamic traditions narrate that he will return to earth near the day of judgement to restore justice and defeat al-Masī? ad-Dajjāl (lit. "the false messiah", also known as the Antichrist) and the enemies of Islam. As a just ruler, Jesus will then die.[137]<br>  <br>  Like all prophets in Islam, Jesus is considered to have been a Muslim, as he preached for people to adopt the straight path in submission to God's will. Islam denies that Jesus was God or the son of God, stating that he was an ordinary man who, like other prophets, had been divinely chosen to spread God's message. Islamic texts forbid the association of partners with God (shirk), emphasizing the notion of God's divine oneness (tawhīd). As such, Jesus is referred to in the Qur'an frequently as the "son of Mary" ("Ibn Maryam").[137][138] Numerous titles are given to Jesus in the Qur'an, such as mubārak (blessed) and `abd-Allāh (servant of God). Another title is al-Masī? ("the messiah; the anointed one" i.e. by means of blessings), although it does not correspond with the meaning accrued in Christian belief. Jesus is seen in Islam as a precursor to Muhammad, and is believed by Muslims to have foretold the latter's coming.[137]|`|RSDlCGdwaa	all believe in a singular all encompassing god.<br>  1.

Here's a couple comments from an impartial white american male:<br>  White women aren't any more likely to be unfaithful than any other race.  Nor are they more likely to be slutty.  It all depends on their upbringing, and in our culture, "sexual expression" seems to be encouraged by the media, "hip" parents, and "progressive" political types.  (Interestingly, the Republican party, George Bush's party, is traditionally conservative - discouraging premarital sex and promoting family values.  I say "interestingly" becuase I would expect that a Persian is not particularly fond of Bush and his like.)   As someone who prefers a girl with little or no sexual past, I've come to accept that it's just not realistic to meet and fall in love with a virgin (at my age, anyway).  We therefore must not dwell on our partner's pasts, and let time dictate whether or not the person is someone we want to be with.  Other than being white, If you suspect that the girl is the type that may cheat, you shouldn't get involved with her anyway.  In any case, I would argue that your stereotype is unfounded.<br>  Best of luck!|`|AA10357276	Then go out with a Persian girl. Or an Asian, African American, or Hispanic girl? This is America, there are many different people here that you can choose to date. Now if you're stuck on the white chick, get over your stereotypes against her and date her. If you can't then it wasn't meant to be.
GhEWfyFxaa	Hmmm actually it is just a stereotype that they are all sexy, hot, beautifull, tall, leggy, blonde with blue eyes. If you even know ABBA, one lady is blonde and the other has brown hair. Even the guys in the band are more dark-haired than blonde. If you actually go there, you'll see an even mix of blondes and dark-haired Swedes. Oh and many Swedes have brown eyes, too! Most Swedes speak really good English and enjoy talking to foreigners. They are very friendly, but difficult to get to know on a deeper level. Saying that, if you do get close with a Swede, they'll be a friend for life. They love to celebrate holidays and drinking is a favored past-time.<br>  <br>  The ideal Swede with a family is called a "Svenson". <br>  Svensons are known to have 2-3 kids, a golden retriever, a house with a nice yard, a car, and even an RV to go camping often. :)|`|AA10357276	That they're blonde haired, have blue eyes, are tall and like ABBA? I meant that they like to listen to ABBA, not that they're like ABBA.

MYjAhq4Paa	So you are saying since black men can't have an Asian woman, they choose to be gay?   Damn, I better start following my husband around, lol.  That theory is waaayyy out there!|`|tZF64L7yaa	I would say that people do not "choose" to become gay. People may decide to act on their homosexual feelings or not, but the person is genetically predisposed to be homosexual. It is not a choice. That said, probably nearly 10% of men all races are actually gay. Black men are not gay more often than whites, Asians, Hispanics, etc. If they act on it more, then it would be because the culture that these particular black men grew up in allows them freedom to express their sexuality in an open manner, though I have not personally noticed more gay men of any particular ethnic background. <br>  <br>  Black men, or most men, for that matter,  who are straight would probably be willing to date any reasonably attractive, kind woman that isn't a "psycho". lol. Most men don't sit around waiting for the hottest chick to show up, or they would never get laid (for a guy in his teens & 20s), or settle down and have a family (for a guy in his 30s) ! A lot of guys will settle for an average looking chick, or even prefer them, especially because they perceive the less attractive women as being  less expensive to "maintain", less likely to cheat, better in bed, or maybe even desperate. Though these stereotypes are not necessarily true, these men aren't going to wait around for a dream woman, even if this ideal is a gorgeous Asian woman. If he can't find that hottie, then he'll settle for the girl next door. He will not "turn gay" simply because one particular type of woman is not available to him. <br>  <br>  To put it bluntly, a sweaty, greasy, hairy, grunting Paul Bunyan style man with an enormous, scary, throbbing....... would not be a fun alternative to a pair of silky bouncy breasts on a sweet lady with a few extra pounds or something. Any straight dude is gonna have to agree with me that a lack of Asian girls isn't going to send him down the...alternate lifestyle route. If, as an attractive Asian woman, you don't want to date black men, you are completely free to date whatever guy or girl you find attractive during your life. However, I just don't think those men are losing sleep or their sexual orientation over your personal lack of interest. They'll live. And, for at least 90% of them, they'll find another lady they like.|`|CvSKPHiqaa	you do KNOW about lady-boys right???????|`|AA11324125	girl wake up and smell the cats!! they simply dont want you|`|5Co6Sp3oaa	That's okay you chinky b*tch, you'll be doing my African American nails and scrubbing my black feet later.<br>  <br>  How does that make you feel?

The child has done something that they knew they were not really supposed to do, and the punishment is a measured response, calculated to help the child to learn how to do the right things at the right time, in the right ways.<br>  <br>  Just because a child misbehaves does not necessarily mean the parent will punish them. The parent might not punish if the circumstances are such that the child really didn't know what to do, or the parent might not punish if the child has already learned their lesson because of other consequences. In some cases, the parent might not punish because the actual offense is so minor that it deserves nothing more than a remark not to do it again, please.<br>  <br>  Your experience of punishment might be different from mine.<br>  <br>  Some parents get angry at the child and strike or abuse. They punish to soothe their own hurts and fears. They also bring down on themselves terrible consequences: their children write them off when they get to be adults, and the parents may even wind up defending themselves in court.<br>  <br>  Some parents limit their punishments to events that are especially severe, and otherwise allow their children to go their own way. We would say that these parents are too lax, and their children often grow up without a clear moral compass.<br>  <br>  Do you think God is as a parent to us humans? What kind of a parent do you think God is?  <br>  <br>  Punishment is also associated with government. There are laws that tell us what we must do and what we must not do, and if we violate a law, there are penalties that we would usually call punishment.<br>  <br>  If you exceed the speed limit, you may get a ticket if you get caught, and then you will have to pay a fine. After a few months, your record is wiped clean.<br>  <br>  If you do a crime, you may have to go to jail for a time. You may be on parole for a while, and then, for the most part, your record is again wiped clean. Only in the most dire cases is there even the possibility of life imprisonment or even the death penalty.<br>  <br>  One of the cardinal pillars of our justice system is knowing that what you do is wrong. If it can be shown that you did not know what you were doing was wring, it usually is grounds for dismissal of the case. Even in the situation where a person should have known that what they were doing was wrong, but that their mental state was such that they no longer understood the difference of right from wrong, that is grounds for a verdict of innocent. <br>  <br>  In our daily life, we often are offended by others, but if we come to realize that they did not know what they did was wrong, we cut them some slack. "Oh, what the heck. He didn't know any better. Let's just forget it."<br>  <br>  What do you think?

Now say I ignored God & kept it up, Then, same as any other Father, who needs to corrects their child for acting up, First He will tell us nicely, then what ever else it takes to keep us in line.

These are just methods to love God. All these methods for gradually evoking love for Godhead. They were being preached to different kinds of people at various circumstances by the powerful authorised representatives of God.<br>  All of them lead either slowly or fastly should lead to Love of Godhead.<br>  <br>  But the fanatical understanding of God has led to this rascaldom.<br>  In this case, the so-called christians ( not all, but these rascal converters) should stop cheating people by showing them jobs, money, education. It is openly known that these rascals are being funded from America. And there, big rascals are pumping out huge money just to see Christainity growing. But those rascals, don't even know abt their real teachings of Christainity. First let them be true christains by following the Ten Commandments. First being "Thou shall not kill". They can't even follow this and they want everyone to be christains. Absolute rascaldom.<br>  And these people have exploited the poverty-stricken people in many parts of India. Fanatic preachers!!! with great rascaldom. <br>  So, they have been doing these from past few years vigorously and even the so-called Hindus also(without the proper understanding of actual meaning of Religion) have been little fanatical. But their pain is understood. These preachers have diplomatically destroyed Indian Culture and want to spread their empire.<br>  So, they are facing the right wrath in small amounts. In one sense, this is justified, because it is tit for tat. Though I do not support this, nonsense fanatical preaching should be stopped and rather they should be better christians.

The chief minister said sorry and met bishop in Bangalore condemning the attack. This kinda attack can happen anywhere and even some policemen were suspended for dereliction of duty.<br>  <br>  Now the bigger question of Orissa's Kandhamal district. To describe it as a war over religion is to simplify it, it's essentially a decades-old conflict over identity, rights and entitlements. The problem is that after independence tribal people were not touched by Indian govt so that they can maintain there indigenous way of living. One tribe panna dalit tribe converted to christianity (debatable issue whether forced etc). They were also educated by missionaries and eventually they became successful, rich and assertive. Majority Hindu tribes say that Christians have grabbed their lands (land owned by tribes people in India cannot be bought under the country's laws) - and used fake certificates to declare themselves as tribes people to take advantage of complex affirmative action benefits like government jobs (reservation in India for scheduled tribe in job is 7.5%).<br>  Of course there is merit in some of these allegations and officials should have investigated them, but they rather let the animosity grow. <br>  It is a cocktail of problems: economic, ethnic, religious. Any of these factors can precipitate violence in these parts<br>  As the area is full of jungles and tribal people are scattered, it is becoming very difficult to control the violence.<br>  What is clear that none of this would have happened if the state had carried out its duties on time - addressed the tribes peoples' grievances, prevented land and identity fraud and protected both communities from rabble rousers.<br>  However I think Christian community has a very bright future in India.

The Christian mythology implies that no matter what happens, everyone is a sinner and must repent: “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned" ( Rom. 5:12). The Bible emphasises this by stressing that belief in Jesus would allow people to overcome death, by earning salvation in the hereafter. The New Testament teaches that rejection of Jesus as the path to salvation must be viewed as a rebellion against God. This choice of separation then inevitably sentences that person to Hell. Only belief in Jesus could save a person from this fate: “For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive." (1 Cor. 15:22) It is immoral to imply that all people are inherently sinners, no matter how one looks upon such a statement. Telling people that they are wholly dependant on a person far removed from this modern age and time for their salvation externalizes their own goodness, and creates a Christian guilt complex that can be hard to overcome. Despite the fact that Christians strongly believe that no one is truly good: "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one." (Rom. 3:10) The Bible is clearly shown to contradict itself in this belief by stating: "And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation." (Gen. 7:1) In General, this whole concept of punishing billions of people for the acts of one is clearly immoral and contradictory and should not be pushed upon people like it has been in today’s modern society.<br>  <br>  All religions have the same basic ingredients, with local variations. Laws are introduced in order to control the population. These laws come from a higher authority that can not be challenged because they come from a source beyond the reach, or question, of man. It keeps the population in check - follow the 'law' or be punished, obey and be rewarded, though not in this life of course which we admit is pretty horrible, but after you die and go to paradise.|`|wwiBbCR7aa	It's easy to criticise any belief system from outside, as you seem happy to do.

How it used in Exodus 20:5 to describe God is different from how it is used to describe the sin of jealousy (Galatians 5:20). When we use the word jealous, we use it in the sense of being envious of someone who has something we don't have. A person might be jealous or envious of another person because he or she has a nice car or home (possessions). Or a person might be jealous or envious of another person because of some ability or skill that other person has (such as athletic ability). Another example would be that one person might be jealous or envious of another because of his or her beauty.<br>  <br>  When we look at this verse, we find that it is not that God is jealous or envious because someone has something He wants that He does not possess. Exodus 20:4-5 says, "You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; you shall not bow down to them nor serve them. For I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God..." Notice that in this verse God is talking about being jealous if someone gives something that belongs to Him to another. <br>  <br>  In these verses, God is speaking of people making idols and bowing down and worshiping those idols instead of giving God the worship that belongs to Him alone. God is possessive of the worship and service that belong to Him. It is a sin (as God points out in this commandment) to worship or serve anything other than Him. So, in summary, it is a sin when we desire, or we are envious, or we are jealous of someone because he has something that we do not have. It is a different use of the word jealous when God says He is jealous. What He is jealous for belongs to Him; worship and service belong to Him alone, and are to be given to Him alone.<br>  <br>  Perhaps a practical example will help us to understand the difference. If a husband sees another man flirting with his wife, he is right to be jealous, for only he has the right to flirt with his wife. This type of jealousy is not sinful. Rather, it is entirely appropriate. Being jealous for something that belongs to you is good and appropriate. Jealousy is a sin when it is a desire for something that does not belong to you. Worship, praise, honor, and adoration belong to God alone, for only He is truly worthy of it. Therefore, God is rightly jealous when worship, praise, honor, or adoration is given to idols. This is precisely the jealousy the Apostle Paul described in 2 Corinthians 11:2, "I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy..."<br>  <br>  -Till Christ Returns<br>  <br>  God Bless|`|zqa4R4C0aa	Well,<br>  <br>  Jealousy is an uncomfortable emotion to have or to be near. Yet how is it possible that a good God is jealous and is there such a thing as a good jealousy?<br>  <br>  Back to the Bible, an international Christian radio ministry, discussed the idea that God is jealous recently and the meaning for God’s jealousy during a series on the character of God.<br>  <br>  Dr. Woodrow Kroll, president and senior Bible teacher for the ministry, explained last week that God’s jealousy stems from Him wanting the best life for man which can only be achieved through a relationship with Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  “When you're talking about God's jealousy, God is jealous over you having the very best you can possibly have in a sinful world,” said Kroll during a BTTB broadcast Friday.<br>  <br>  “Anything that leads us away from God is detrimental to our relationship with God and God is jealous over that relationship.”<br>  <br>  The Bible instructor pointed as example to Exodus 34 when God warned Moses and the Israelite to not make covenants with the original inhabitants of Canaan, intermarry with other tribes, and “Do not worship any other god, for the Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God” (Exodus 34:14).<br>  <br>  Kroll explains that God is jealous because He is afraid of losing His people if they mix with other people.<br>  <br>  “And, yet, we think of God's jealousy as a bad thing because God's jealousy says, ‘Don't do this; it's bad for you and your relationship with Me,’” said Kroll. “If God is jealous because He wants my relationship with Him to be a right relationship that is not a bad thing. That is a wonderful thing.”<br>  <br>  Similarly, the Ten Commandments, was given not to confine man, but “in order to order our lives so that we can be happy and fulfilled.”<br>  <br>  “God is so jealous over us; He doesn't want us doing the kinds of things that will rob us of blessings He's already given to us,” explained Kroll.<br>  <br>  Sin interferes with man’s relationship with God and his ability to receive blessing, according to the BTTB head. God is jealous because He doesn’t want sin “robbing” His children of the “good things” they can have if they have a close relationship with Him.<br>  <br>  “The fact that God is jealous over your relationship is something you ought to thank Him for every day of your life. If God were not jealous, who knows where you would be in your relationship with Him today?”<br>  |`|QiO7fXwzaa	It's a very human emotion, huh...

Our sages explain that firstly G-d is not "jealous" that is a human characteristic made for us to understand G-d on a human level.  Another reason idol worship is considered "bad" is because back in the days of the ancient religions, people worshiped their gods in disgusting ways.  For example the Moabites would worship their idols by shitting on them.  Which does not seem to be a form of worship but they did it because they thought they were giving a personal part of themselves minus the whole human sacrifice bit.  Other practices included orgies, rapes, bloodshed, sorcery, and then there was the human sacrifices.  One of the most common practices was the Molech, where worshipers would sacrifice their children as fire offerings to their gods.  Because the whole basis of idol worship is immoral and will lead to human sacrifice.|`|43e3a69ed6d27aa5b99e02fe573ed8b8aa	God knows you can not serve but one thing.

God created Lucifer.  Lucifer rebelled and tried to steal the kingdom from God.  He was evil.  I mean sin had not been in heaven before and Lucifer is the one who started it.  He was so smart and clever he managed to pull 1/3 of the angels into his realm of rebellion.  At that point God had to throw them out of heaven before eternal disaster happened.<br>  <br>  If we worship other Gods, we are in essence, worshiping the evil spirits that Lucifer who became the devil, is inspiring and ordering around.  Why worship the devil---that's what it amounts to in the end.  Sin gets worse.  The non-Christians will end up worship ping the beast and antichrist.  They will all end up in the lake of fire.<br>  <br>  I can't understand why the Atheists are mad at God for not inviting them to heaven.  What have they done to deserve heaven?  They have been serving satan, who was Lucifer, the very one who tried to destroy his kingdom.  They need to get their eyes open.

You can use almost anything he said.<br>  Or Ecclesiastes or Psalms.<br>  <br>  Those who have borne the greatest sorrows are frequently the ones who carry the greatest comfort to others, bringing sunshine wherever they go. Such ones have been chastened and sweetened by their afflictions; they did not lose confidence in God when trouble assailed them, but clung closer to His protecting love. Such ones are living proof of the tender care of God, who makes the darkness as well as the light and chastens us for our good. Christ is the light of the world; in Him is no darkness. Precious light! Let us live in that light! Bid adieu to sadness and repining. Rejoice in the Lord always.   <br>       It is selfish to devote our precious time to mourning over disappointed hopes, indulging in useless grief that clouds the family circle. We should be cheerful, if only for the benefit of those who depend more or less upon us for happiness. . . . It is our duty to make the best of everything, and to cultivate a habit of looking at the bright side of things. Let the cloud that shadows us pass over, while we wait patiently till the clear blue sky again appears and the blessed sunshine is revealed. . . . Let us all forget self as much as possible, cultivate cheerfulness, seek to brighten the lives of others, and we shall then have less desire to complain of our own lot.   <br>       The afflicted may take courage, the desponding may hope, for they have a sympathizing friend in Jesus. All our troubles and griefs we may pour into His sympathizing ears. When we associate together let it not be to talk darkness and unbelief, to recount the gloomy chapters in our life experience. Let us talk of the love of God that has been manifested to us, that is seen in nature, in the firmament of the heavens, in all the wise arrangements of Providence. Let us search out the rays of sunshine that have brightened our pathway, and linger over their memory with grateful hearts. Let us dwell upon the matchless love of Christ, for in Him we have a constant theme of rejoicing. In Him is no darkness.

But this is misleading. Srila Prabhupada disavows connection with the pantheism, polytheism, and caste consciousness that pervades modern Hinduism. Although Krsna consciousness and modern Hinduism share a common historical root--India's ancient Vedic culture--Hinduism has become, along with the other "great religions," a sectarian establishment, whereas Krsna consciousness is universal and transcends relative, sectarian designations.<br>  <br>     There is a misconception that the Krsna consciousness movement represents the Hindu religion. In fact, however, Krsna consciousness is in no way a faith or religion that seeks to defeat other faiths or religions. Rather, it is an essential cultural movement for the entire human society and does not consider any particular sectarian faith. This cultural movement is especially meant to educate people in how they can love God.<br>     Sometimes Indians both inside and outside of India think that we are preaching the Hindu religion, but actually we are not. One will not find the word Hindu in the Bhagavad-gita. Indeed, there is no such word as Hindu in the entire Vedic literature. This word has been introduced by the Muslims from provinces next to India, such as Afghanistan, Baluchistan, and Persia. There is a river called Sindhu bordering the north western provinces of India, and since the Muslims there could not pronounce Sindhu properly, they instead called the river Hindu, and the inhabitants of this tract of land they called Hindus. In India, according to the Vedic language, the Europeans are called mlecchas or yavanas. Similarly, Hindu is a name given by the Muslims.<br>     India's actual culture is described in the Bhagavad-gita, where it is stated that according to the different qualities or modes of nature there are different types of men, who are generally classified into four social orders and four spiritual orders. This system of social and spiritual division is known as varnasrama-dharma. The four varnas, or social orders, are brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya. and sudra. The four asramas, or spiritual orders, are brahmacarya, grhastha, vanaprastha, and sannyasa. The varnasrama system is described in the Vedic scriptures known as the Puranas. The goal of this institution of Vedic culture is to educate every man for advancement in knowledge of Krsna, or God. That is the entire Vedic program.<br>     When Lord Caitanya talked with the great devotee Ramananda Raya, the Lord asked him, "What is the basic principle of human life?" Ramananda Raya answered that human civilization begins when varnasrama-dharma is accepted. Before coming to the standard of varnasrama-dharma there is no question of human civilization. Therefore, the Krsna consciousness movement is trying to establish this right system of human civilization, which is known as Krsna consciousness, or daiva-varnasrama--divine culture.<br>     In India, the varnasrama system has now been taken in a perverted way, and thus a man born in the family of a brahmana (the highest social order) claims that he should be accepted as a brahmana. But this claim is not accepted by the sastra (scripture). One's forefather may have been a brahmana according to gotra, or the family hereditary order, but real varnasrama-dharma is based on the factual quality one has attained, regardless of birth or heredity. Therefore, we are not preaching the present-day system of the Hindus, especially those who are under the influence of Sankaracarya, for Sankaracarya taught that the Absolute Truth is impersonal, and thus he indirectly denied the existence of God.<br>     Sankaracarya's mission was special; he appeared to reestablish the Vedic influence after the influence of Buddhism. Because Buddhism was patronized by Emperor Asoka, twenty-six hundred years ago the Buddhist religion practically pervaded all of India. According to the Vedic literature, Buddha was an incarnation of Krsna who had a special power and who appeared for a special purpose. His system of thought, or faith, was accepted widely, but Buddha rejected the authority of the Vedas. While Buddhism was spreading, the Vedic culture was stopped both in India and in other places. Therefore, since Sankaracarya's only aim was to drive away Buddha's system of philosophy, he introduced a system called Mayavada.<br>     Strictly speaking, Mayavada philosophy is atheism, for it is a process in which one imagines that there is God. This Mayavada system of philosophy has been existing since time immemorial. The present Indian system of religion or culture is based on the Mayavada philosophy of Sankaracarya, which is a compromise with Buddhist philosophy. According to Mayavada philosophy there actually is no God, or if God exists, He is impersonal and all-pervading and can therefore be imagined in any form. This conclusion is not in accord with the Vedic literature. That literature names many demigods, who are worshiped for different purposes, but in every case the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, Visnu, is accepted as the supreme controller. That is real Vedic culture.<br>     The philosophy of Krsna consciousness does not deny the existence of God and the demigods, but Mayavada philosophy denies both; it maintains that neither the demigods nor God exists. For the Mayavadis, ultimately all is zero. They say that one may imagine any authority--whether Visnu, Durga, Lord Siva, or the sun-god--because these are the demigods generally worshiped in society. But the Mayavada philosophy does not in fact accept the existence of any of them. The Mayavadis say that because one cannot concentrate one's mind on the impersonal Brahman, one may imagine any of these forms. This is a new system, called pancopasana. It was introduced by Sankaracarya, but the Bhagavad-gita does not teach any such doctrines, and therefore they are not authoritative.<br>     The Bhagavad-gita accepts the existence of the demigods. The demigods are described in the Vedas, and one cannot deny their existence, but they are not to be understood or worshiped according to the way of Sankaracarya. The worship of demigods is rejected in the Bhagavad-gita. The Gita (7.20) clearly states:<br>  <br>                     kamais tais tair hrta jnanah<br>                       prapadyante 'nya-devatah<br>                       tam tam niyamam asthaya<br>                        prakrtya niyatah svaya<br>  <br>     "Those whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto demigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own natures." Furthermore, in the Bhagavad-gita (2.44), Lord Krsna states:<br>  <br>                       bhogaisvarya-prasaktanam<br>                          tayapahrta-cetasam<br>                        vyavasayatmika buddhih<br>                        samadhau na vidhiyate<br>  <br>     "In the minds of those who are too attached to sense enjoyment and material opulence, and who are bewildered by such things, the resolute determination for devotional service does not take place." Those who are pursuing the various demigods have been described as hrta jnanah, which means "those who have lost their sense." That is also further explained in the Bhagavad-gita (7.23):<br>  <br>                       antavat tu phalam tesam<br>                      tad bhavaty alpa-medhasam<br>                        devan deva-yajo yanti<br>                       mad-bhakta yanti mam api<br>  <br>     "Men of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are limited and temporary. Those who worship the demigods go to the planets of the demigods, but My devotees reach My supreme abode." The rewards given by the demigods are temporary, because any material facility must act in connection with the temporary body. Whatever material facilities one gets, whether by modern scientific methods or by deriving benedictions from the demigods, will be finished with the body. But spiritual advancement will never be finished.<br>     People should not think that we are preaching a sectarian religion. No. We are simply preaching how to love God. There are many theories about the existence of God. The atheist, for example, will never believe in God. Atheists like Professor Jacques Monod, who won the Nobel prize, declare that everything is chance (a theory already put forward long ago by atheistic philosophers of India such as Carvaka). Then other philosophies, such as the karma-mimamsa philosophy, accept that if one goes on doing his work nicely and honestly, automatically the result will come, without need for one to refer to God. For evidence, the proponents of such theories cite the argument that if one is diseased with an infection and takes medicine to counteract it, the disease will be neutralized. But our argument in this connection is that even if one gives a man the best medicine, he still may die. The results are not always predictable. Therefore, there is a higher authority, daiva-netrena, a supreme director. Otherwise, how is it that the son of a rich and pious man becomes a hippie in the street or that a man who works very hard and becomes rich is told by his doctor, "Now you may not eat any food, but only barley water"?<br>     The karma-mimamsa theory holds that the world is going on without the supreme direction of God. Such philosophies say that everything takes place by lust (kama-haitukam). By lust a man becomes attracted to a woman, and by chance there is sex, and the woman becomes pregnant. There is actually no plan to make the woman pregnant, but by a natural sequence when a man and a woman unite, a result is produced. The atheistic theory, which is described in the Sixteenth Chapter of the Bhagavad-gita as asuric, or demoniac, is that actually everything is going on|`|e3ca9511c7f5d30fa7fbdc3102dea85baa	Hin comes from the root Himsa which means "Violence"<br>  Du comes from the root Dur which means "Far from"<br>  Hinduism means "Far from Violence"|`|39qgkAnHaa	How ignorant!<br>  <br>  How would you feel if you were reading this and you were Hindu.

Instead, they performed a ceremony whereby they worshiped the cows, brahmanas and Govardhana Hill. At that time Krsna expanded Himself and declared, "I am Govardhana Hill." In this way He accepted all the paraphernalia and food offered to Govardhana Hill.

The honest and simple cowherd men, headed by Nanda Maharaja, accepted Krsna's proposal and executed in detail everything He advised. They performed Govardhana worship and circumambulation of the hill. According to the instruction of Lord Krsna, Nanda Maharaja and the cowherd men called in learned brahmanas and began to worship Govardhana Hill by chanting Vedic hymns and offering prasada. The inhabitants of Vrndavana assembled together, decorated their cows and gave them grass. Keeping the cows in front, they began to circumambulate Govardhana Hill."|`|2de0b79e82da7f529f88b7bd06230c4faa	- The false one  . . .

Yes, they do have a dress code - they are required to wear white shirts and ties.  They are also required to be clean-shaven and clean-cut.  This is just a simple image thing.  They want to be perceived as clean-cut, handsome, and honest people, which for the most part, they are.  :-)<br>  <br>  They travel on bicycle in many areas because it's less expensive than traveling via automobile.<br>  <br>  The "power underwear" is similar to other religions' use of symbols to remind them of what they believe.  Like a Jewish Star of David, a Christian cross, a Muslim head covering, etc, etc.  Most religions have something like this.<br>  <br>  We believe that our theology is less corruptible than others because we believe in active, continuing revelation from God through living prophets.  This is a pretty major difference from most other religions, which rely instead upon tradition and ancient scripture.  While we value those things, we also accept modern-day revelation.

d3fpmDBcaa	I would be more than Happy to have an African American president. I just don't think Obama is the one. <br>  Since race has been brought up in this post, I find it amusing that when Obama was initially in the running before he "won" the candidacy he was too white and now he's fine.|`|oYVxMmbQaa	I can't wait for the day when a man with good sense takes the White House. I don't care about color.<br>  <br>  But the man who has the most sense happens to be Black.|`|4a43ce24fc25ee210c17b8882b616386aa	Race is irrevelant, I don't want any more b.s (bush). Obama is the better choice, McCain and Palin are not. Stop being racist!|`|ItjUfDplaa	I'm an Obama supporter, but your question is racist. A canidates race should not be an issue, it should never be a deciding factor in who you vote for. I vote for canidates based on the issues and what they stand for, not on their skin color. I would encourage you and others to do the same. |`|O9FojdEMaa	How about waiting to see what kind of job he does before heaping on praise. personally i voted for McCain and wish i could vote again about a hundred million times . not that John is so great but i do not trust Obama. i hope i live long enough to say i told you so.|`|oqs6n07aaa	I'm a black female and I like Obama, but he can't go into office (esp as a black man) bossing people around and expecting to be liked. His task will be to get the folks in Washington on his side so that they will back his proposals. |`|JxUFDutxaa	How about a strong intelligent man leading a nation?<br>  If we keep harping on colour, this world will never change.|`|AA11601031	I voted for Obama - but your post is really stupid.  I should add that Frontline had a wonderful show last night on the background of Obama.  I thought it was interesting that Obama, having been elected President of the Harvard Law Review (with the support of some conservative members), turned around and put the best people on the editorial board - REGARDLESS OF THEIR POLITICAL VIEWPOINTS.  I think this guy knows that he needs to put the best people around him.  I expect to see some Republicans in the cabinet (Richard Lugar may be Secretary of State).  I think he has a chance to be a great President - maybe the greatest in quite some time.  I sure hope that most Americans - including those who voted for McCain - will wish the best for Obama.  This country needs a first rate leader at this crucial juncture in our history.|`|1e9d3b83ee4eab612b90db60f5cea95daa	Just because we'll have a black man at the helm doesn't mean "the black man" will lead "the white man."<br>  <br>  95% of the other politicians will still be white males...|`|AA11059890	we got stuck with $#@&ing steve harper again so try and picture how ecstatic i am *pops his cheek and walks away*|`|12TtrXSKaa	Nothing will change all that much in society if Obama becomes the next President.

I should have been asked a little nicer.|`|KMnQbzqFaa	you are being racist i 'm voting for oboma but he's also white you know not just black this will be a black man and i white man together as president history if he gets it stop being racist and hope who ever gets it can bring this country back thanks to bush 8 years of stupidity.|`|PRg9UgOlaa	Wow, another Obamaite bringing race back into the mix. Funny, how it has been only Obamaites playing the race card.<br>  <br>  And you are wrong, just because election day is next week does not mean that next week Obama (or McCain, since that is who will win) will take over the White House.|`|mwCZORe7aa	What's with the ignorance??? Election is about picking a good candidate for the president who can do his job well and benefit the people and not about racial war!

VVl4s60maa	ten points baby!!!|`|oRMEtsJwaa	Halloween is a originally a pagan holiday with maskes and blood sacrifices. Your teacher may be a bit uptight as nowadays it's all about dressing up and candy, but that's what she's talking about. I personally love the chance to dress like someone else for a night and have friends over. |`|UYkt9FfZaa	Oh, dear.  Your question should be why it's despised by one particular old-fashioned reading bozo.  Because THIS old-fashioned reading bozo is enthusiastic about it, and I can't possibly be the only one.<br>  <br>  All Hallows is the old name for All Saints Day, the day that the Catholic--and Anglo-Catholic--Church celebrates all the saints who never made it onto the calendar.  This would include your late holy aunt, for instance, who did NOT found a religious order.  The eve of major saints' days used to be seen as a sort of last-ditch chance for the devil to work evil, I think (compare Walpurgisnacht), so the night before the feast of all God's holy warriors would be the biggest of those.<br>  <br>  Certainly a number of Halloween customs come from non-religious or para-religious sources.  The concentration on ghosts, vampires, etc., is left over from the old Celtic idea that on Samhain (pronounced more or less SOW-en) the veil between this world and the next gets awfully thin.  The jack-o-lanterns represent devils and/or scare demons away.  And giving treats to the little witches, goblins, and hockey-masked Jasons at your door is perhaps uncomfortably reminiscent of leaving food and drink outside so that the wandering malevolent spirits would leave you alone.<br>  <br>  I am a thoroughly committed Roman Catholic, and I like using the old customs in new ways.  Same as we do, far more spectacularly, at Christmas.  (You didn't know Christ was born on Norse holiday named Yule?  Then you aren't enough of a reading bozo, dearie.)|`|G11cR4xhaa	Well it started being a Pagan holiday.Some Christians(I know the truth about it.) know about the human sacrifices that took place on Samhain.So it's pretty bad.Now it's sorta of an insult to what it was really about.Now don't get me wrong(I do work at Six Flags Fright Fest @ Great Adventure as a follow spot tech at Dead Man's Party and get to dress up as The Phantom of The Opera er Six Flags.)<br>  Here's the wiki entry about Halloween.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween</a><br>  <br>  Heres a Christian site about it as well.<br>  <a href="http://www.christiansunite.com/halloween.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.christiansunite.com/halloween...</a><br>  <br>  I hope this helps.<br>  
w4l8NajJaa	lol just sneak downstairs and out the backdoor lol. do it when shes not looking or just tell her flat out that its halloween and all your freinds are going somewhere and you want to go with them. Your mom cant be that heartless<br>  |`|okTecGZfaa	If you can't do it safely, don't do it. One other thought to be aware of, the sounds of the ladder and you banging/scraping against the wall as you climb down will be easily heard inside the building. Assuming you're not actually grounded, it would make more sense to see if you could instead have a friend or two come over for the evening to hang out with.|`|DPnaFbeOaa	Man you better chill. if somebody is stupid enough to tell you that, they should get arrested. Do you know how much stuff happens on halloween. im 16 and i wouldnt do not stuff like that. lol|`|uOf3yd5baa	Woww, that sucks. Hey, just go downstairs and out the door. I always go downstairs and uhh have a midnight snack and I don't get caught haha|`|36zWGWOnaa	if there's a tree near by any window that you have access to then you could climb down that. |`|VijDG2yaaa	Can you just stay downstairs like watching TV or something?

What you want your Mom to worry, you want nobody to know where you are if something bad happens to you. Please sneaking outta the house is childish. Why not instead ask your Mom if you can have some friends over? |`|TSaXfI54aa	if isnt too high.... push some pillows and soft things our your window and jump on those. also you could tie a sturdy rope to something in your room and hold on to the rope and jump. and if your house has bumps on the side of it, hold on to those a climb down|`|RKZHGqh7aa	Stay over at a friend's house and trick or treat with her. |`|jNOQPPTpaa	DON'T.|`|wlsAuriUaa	Don't do it!!!  "WHEN YOU GET CAUGHT"... you mom will never trust you again.
wwRasDZLaa	Some mall shops will have a bowl of candy for trick or treaters.  You can also have a Halloween party-- burgers, ice cream, candy and rent a dvd (The Charlie Brown Halloween special comes to mind.  Some of the other horror movies might be too intense for kids).|`|S2tBYhCKaa	Telephone senior citizen assisted living management to schedule<br>  a drive-by.|`|oRMEtsJwaa	rest homes (good for the patients as well), dorm rooms, mall, apartment buildings with over hangs.

8321dcc91dbc3f1a3f5120ba6e386798aa	"apostles" are an actual gifting mentioned in the Bible....<br>  <br>  "popes" are NOT mentioned in the Bible....|`|DuyuUJNDaa	The word Pope comes from the Latin 'papa' or 'father' written in Greek as π?πα? [pápas]. This is the definitive term for the Bishop of Rome.<br>  The apostles were never known as 'fathers'. Only their successors Origen, Clement, Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Polycarp, Ignatius etc - were known as 'The Apostolic Fathers'.|`|2de0b79e82da7f529f88b7bd06230c4faa	  - No, Apostles are Biblical, whereas popes are not...|`|H3vo8VIXaa	No there is no biblical need for a pope, Jesus is our emissary we need no man.|`|nx6BcqTUaa	No|`|1TYZDRUqaa	No. Jesus basically appointed Peter to be the Leader of the Apostles after the Crucifixion, and the popes are the successors of Peter.  If you want an analogy, the Cardinals and Bishops would be the Apostles, and the Priests would be disciples.  |`|AA11440601	Kind of.<br>  <br>  The bishops are the successors of the Apostles and their leader, the Pope, is the direct successor of Peter.<br>  <br>  Why do so many Christian denominations that take the Bible literally have no bishops and presbyters (priests) as described in the New Testament?<br>  <br>  With love in Christ.|`|ec55348158c3fd8764f5daba79c0af3daa	Pope?<br>  <br>  Nope.<br>  <br>  The Catholic Church considers Peter to be the first Pope, but there is no mention of any apostolic leader or Pope in the New Testament.<br>  <br>  Paul mentions elders, which are also known as bishops or presbyters, but never actually details church organization above individual congregations.  Duties and qualifications of elders and deacons are spelled out in somewhat more detail.<br>  <br>  Paul, like the 12 disciples, is considered an apostle.  I find no mention of other apostles in the New Testament.|`|AA10153636	The word Pope doesn't exist in the Bible.<br>  The original Apostles were with Christ personally, but a person now days that is considered an Apostle is usually a missionary or Church planter.. someone that goes to a place that has no church at all and starts one from scratch..|`|AA11707311	In the sense that they are successors, chosen to serve God.<br>  The election of apostles and succession is Biblical and appears by vote in Acts 1:23-26.|`|XKecXwZkaa	The apostles were supposedly chosen by Jesus. Popes, bishops, priests, ministers etc. all chose themselves.

If you *don't* see a version that you think should be on the list, e-mail me and I'll tell you exactly why I did not recommend it.<br>  <br>  Some comments about the previous answers:<br>  <br>  King James Version (KJV) - several reasons this should be avoided, primarily a consequence of its age.  *Unless* you feel that the KJV is the only worthwhile bible, do not use the KJV.  If you *do* need the KJV, I offer recommendations for which edition to buy at the link above.<br>  <br>  New King James Version - based on the same (verifiably unauthentic) NT source text as the KJV - which is one of the primary reasons the KJV should be avoided by non-KJV-only Christians.<br>  <br>  The Message - a paraphrase.  Paraphrase bibles are the opposite of what you are seeking.<br>  <br>  New Living Translation - very easy-to-read version.  Although these are not really the opposite of what you are seeking, very easy-to-read versions tend to result in a "muddying" of the meaning as a result of being restricted to a simplified vocabulary.  I would not recommend the NLT2 *or* the CEV unless ease of reading was a primary concern.<br>  <br>  New World Translation - the Jehovah's Witness bible, a *very* biased translation (which is not the same as saying that it is a mistranslation).  I do not recommend this for you for this reason - though this bible is worthwhile as a secondary study bible.<br>  <br>  Catholic Bibles - actually, one of these is my favorite translation as well as being my favorite study bible.  You can read about the New Jerusalem Bible in the link above.  However, not all Catholic Bibles are the same, and the NJB is normally the only one I recommend (the NAB in certain circumstances).<br>  <br>  New American Standard Bible - I saved one of the most controversial for last.  I say "controversial" because the NASB is a very literal translation, a technique of translation which *tends* to result in *inaccurate* translation.

As a rule, the TNIV and the NIV aren't really that great. And, the NLT isn't so bad. The NLT really just gives the text a clearer interpretation by using more commonly understood terms describing weights, measures, days and times. It is intended to make the Bible relevant to today while staying true in it's message.|`|PDmoIvRwaa	I personally like the New Living Translation.  It is written in the language and phrases of the modern times.  I do not feel that it takes away from the meaning of God's Word.  I also have in my collection a New King James and an NIV.  Compare for yourself, or get one of those Bibles which have all four versions side by side.  I can imagine that an old Greek Bible translated word for word would be the most authentic.  We really need a biblical scholar and/or a pastor to give us a history on this.  I do like to know about the origins of words, along with the historical perspective of Biblical times.  I love the Life Application bible in any version.|`|oZdX2wkqaa	I've heard some Christian extremists say KJV is the one and only true version because they believe it was divinely inspired. But when I asked why they thought KJV was divinely inspired, but none of the other versions were, they offered no reason. Some of them even said that in instances where verses from the KJV might have been incorrectly translated from the original Hebrew, they said the original Hebrew text was wrong!|`|AA11143689	NIV has been widely used and coincides with most other versions, so I don't know why they would say it's terrible.  I have enjoyed reading a few - I thought NIV was from the original Greek and Hebrew.  New American Standard version seems good.  I enjoy Living as it puts it to me in a way I can readily appreciate the context.  I love God's Word-- when I began going to a Christian church when I was 13, I was given a Phillips translation Bible which also was put into todays vernacular - or speech.  I was hungry for God's word.  I remember being wooed by God's spirit - just looking at the verses like in the gospels - Matthew, (Seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you.)  Also - Luke and John (esp) and also how Romans spoke of the new spiritual principle of life lifts us out of the old vicious cycle of sin and death...in Romans 8 :1   Allow God's word to reach deeply into your heart -- and just absorb and take all the good God wants you to have.  Also, I love the Psalms - how they speak tenderly and yet some are from David's desparate circumstances that helps us feel God hears us where we're at. And He does.  And He Cares.  <br>  Getting into the Bible is so important I hope you have a good Bible study that will help you.  Bible Study Fellowship is good.  It is at a number of churches.  There are others just as good, too.  God bless you.  Hope this helps.  |`|2de0b79e82da7f529f88b7bd06230c4faa	  - New King James . . . |`|zHr8YYJuaa	niv <br>  it is soooo much easier to understand<br>  trust me |`|H3vo8VIXaa	KJV <br>  <br>  |`|NvKS8h3caa	New World Translation<br>  And, yes I am a true disciple of Christ, and not because I go to church every Sunday... most that do that don't truly know Christ or his beliefs.  <br>  I am a devout and continuous bible student and minister<br>  <br>  Thomas Winter considers the Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures (part of the NWT project) as “highly useful” toward mastery of biblical Greek.[34] Winter relates that the translation "is thoroughly up-to-date and consistently accurate.”<br>  <br>  In his review of 9 bible translations, Dr. Jason BeDuhn states that the NWT is a ‘remarkably good translation’.[26] He also states, “While it is difficult to quantify this sort of analysis, it can be said the NW emerges as the most accurate of the translations ... judging by the passages we have looked at.” <br>  <br>  Among notable Greek scholars, translators and researchers who recognize the work that went into this translation are: Professor Benjamin Kedar of Israel, Jason Beduhn of Northern Arizona University, Department of Humanities Arts and Religion, J.D. Phillips of , Allen Wikgren who was on the New Revised Standard Version committee, Edgar J. Goodspeed, a professor of Greek at the University of Chicago who also translated the New Testament portion of "The Bible an American Translation". Many of these, and further scholars of incredible merit realize that the NWT is a work of sheer brilliance. <br>  <br>  Most accurate knowledge of this translation come from neutral theologists.  Criticism usually comes from biased christian leaders that want to preserve their taught doctrines<br>  <br>   Hope this helps shed some light!<br>  <br>  |`|T2KgjxqQaa	King James is the most authentic, but it's really hard to understand, it has a lot of deep words and deep meaning, unlike the NIV the same message is there, but it's more simple, anyone can understand it.|`|8H9yJDyLaa	I've been through 46 versions in 7 languages and my favorite is the New King James Spirit-Filled Life Study Bible, it's more literal then the NIV but easier to read than the KJV.|`|5NJNKoV6aa	In Biblical translation there are two main styles: Dynamic equivalency and Formal equivalency.  Dynamic equivalency seeks to translate the main or essential idea contained within the source document and does not focus primarily on strict grammatical equality, but more on getting the point across.  This can create problems where sentence structure and word usage in the source material is actually part of the point the author was trying to make.<br>  <br>  Formal equivalency attempts to make a more word for word translation from the source material or donor language into the receptor language.  Which can create problems when the donor languages use of local or historic idioms or grammer does not translate easily or clearly into the receptor language.<br>  <br>  Usually a bible which combines these two methods into one gives the best result in accuracy to orignal meaning and structure.<br>  <br>  The New American Standard Version has been known for years as the most literal translation into the english language.  It's translators used the formal equivalency method.  It is a great version for general usage and is used by many top scholars, but can be a little bit of a stretch for some who have comprehension troubles.  The New Living Translation is an example of a dynamic equivalency version and reads extremely well but for topical word studies or deep Biblical training and interpretation it is not a good choice.  The New International Version or NIV is an example of a Bible that combines both methods of translation and has been considered probably the best all aroound translation and still the most widely used in the english speaking world.  Another great version would be the English Standard Version (my personal favorite).  Again an example of combined translation methods but leans a little more toward the formal end and uses better more modern english.<br>  <br>  The King James is a great translation, but the language if unfamiliar would take alot of time to become accustomed to before the jewels of scripture could be fully understood.  The New King James is much better in my opinion for a student who likes the classical language style of the KJV but in an easier and more accurately translated english language version.<br>  <br>  While I think Eugene Patterson is a genious I would stay away from The Message for anything other than cursory readings of scripture.<br>  <br>  In short stick with any of the main translations and you should be fine.  Find the one that best fits your study goals, i.e. word study, meditation, simple devotional reading or serious academic work and also one that you find the most comfortable or easy to read.<br>  <br>  99.9% of the criticism you will hear from people about one version or another is coming from folks with absolutely no basis in the biblical languages or knowledge of how we get an english bible.  Mainly folks magpie whatever they have heard from someone else.  Ask your book seller about the different styles of translation and what they have in the different styles.<br>  <br>  My personal suggestion would be either the NIV (New International Version) Study Bible or the new ESV (English Standard Version) Study Bible.  Either one would be a great beginning study tool that you will not outgrow.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, God bless.<br>  <br>  Sorry a little add-on.  There is always a lot of KJV only hype.  The KJV was and is a great translation of the bible, but it has it's issues like every other other  translation.  Anyone who speaks more than one language can attest to the fact that when taking a phrase from one language and putting into another you never, I repeat never, ever will have a "literal" translation.  You can be very close, but languages just do not work that way.  The KJV is great if you want a translation into a 400 year old language.  You will hear it called the authorized version or the first, both are incorrect.  Ask yourself: Authorized by whom?<br>  <br>  The KJV is also not the first.  There were at least six english translations of the bible prior to the KJV and some would rightly argue a few were better.  Due to political influence and and an issue with the divine right of kings good old James decided he didn't like the notes in the Geneva Study Bible and had it republished without notes as Authorized King James Version.  Can you say dictator?  So actually the KJV was based on the Geneva which was based on two earlier manuscripts which where based on the Vulgate and the Septuagint and many original manuscripts.<br>  <br>  That being cleared up there is only one version truly based on or using the KJV as source material and that is the NKJV.  All other translations use original manuscripts from numerous collections as well as the dead sea scoll manuscipts and the afore mentioned Septuagint and Vulgate.<br>  <br>  One last thing.  There have been no less than 20 biblical manuscript findings since the publishing of the original KJV all with more ancient sources than those used by the original translators of the works which the KJV was based upon.<br>  <br>  Bless all.

AoyC3Xi9aa	Have you truly been saved? <br>  <br>  Mark 1:15 shows that Jesus started His ministry by calling people to repent and believe the Gospel. Repenting is not just asking for forgiveness, all though that is very important. Repenting is turning away from your sin towards God. Believing means to realize that Christ is the Son of God who did life and die so that you might be given spiritual life. Cry out to God and then follow Him.<br>  <br>  Christ says we must be born-again to enter the kingdom of Heaven (John 3:3). Being born-again means the same thing as being saved. When this happens, you realize that Christ and Christ alone saves. Our salvation has nothing to do with ourselves. Read Ephesians 2. At salvation, Christ forgives us of our sins and makes us new creatures:<br>  <br>  Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come. - 2 Cor 5:17<br>  <br>  I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleannesses, and from all your idols I will cleanse you. And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules. - Ezekiel 36:25-27<br>  <br>  If you are truly saved, you will be changed, like the verses above show. Your relationship with sin should change. You should hate sin in your life and be convicted by the Holy Spirit when you do stumble. God will be your Father and you will be His child.<br>  <br>  If you are saved, God will answer the prayers of His children. Ask for forgiveness and realize that God is a forgiving Father. From that point, repent and follow after Him. Stay in the Word. <br>  <br>  I hope this makes sense. If not, or if you have any other questions, please email me.|`|GRbkPjTNaa	 You have not lost your faith you have weakened it yourself.

"For the wages of sin is death..."<br>  <br>  "... he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God." "it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:" "The wicked shall be turned into hell..."<br>  <br>  BUT JESUS CHRIST LOVES YOU AND DIED FOR YOU.<br>  "But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."<br>  <br>  JESUS CHRIST IS THE ONLY WAY TO HEAVEN.<br>  "Jesus saith., I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me." For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.<br>  <br>  SALVATION IS A FREE GIFT.<br>  "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast."<br>  <br>  NOW THAT YOU HAVE THE TRUTH THE DECISION IS YOURS!<br>  <br>  "The Lord is... not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance." "Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out," Repentance is when a person admits his guilt to God, and sincerely desires in his heart to get right with God.<br>  <br>  "...repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ."<br>  <br>  WILL YOU TRUST JESUS CHRIST AS YOUR LORD AND SAVIOUR?<br>  "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved." Jesus Christ died, was buried and rose again from the dead. He paid for your sins on the cross. That is why He is called the Saviour. You cannot save yourself by good works; baptism, church attendance, sacraments, going to confession; giving money, praying to Mary and the saints, or trying to live a good life. In order to be saved, you must completely put your faith and trust in Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  |`|19922ecff123841b68f933197d10192baa	<br>   Don't worry.

Get back to the basics. Attend a church, read the Bible, pray. You don't have to use fancy words, just talk to God about what's on your mind. Pray when you read the Bible that God would open your mind to His Word. You don't have to read the whole Bible in a year...it's more about quality than quantity. Start with the part that speaks most to you (Psalms, John, Isaiah or whatever) and read a little every day. Take notes if that helps.<br>  <br>  It's important to go to church and associate with other Christians. Ask God to show you where He wants you. Find a church you like with solid teaching and make friends with the people. They will be your support network. And you will be able to help them too.<br>  <br>  God is there, waiting for you to renew your relationship with Him. He is the one who has given you the impulse to find Him again and He's waiting with open arms. No punishment, just forgiveness. <br>  <br>  Welcome home!|`|HIdsFdr3aa	Start in the Scriptures.  The Gospels are a good place to start.  The book of Romans was what God used to "wake me up" to Him.

J3CloKpAaa	Al-Ikhlas<br>  In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful<br>  <br>  Say: He is Allah the One and Only; (1) Allah, the Eternal, Absolute; (2) He begetteth, not nor is He begotten; (3) And there is none like unto Him. (4)<br>  <br>  Who doth greater wrong than he who inventeth a lie against Allah or denieth His revelations? Lo! the wrongdoers will not be successful. (21) And on the day We gather them together We shall say unto those who ascribed partners (unto Allah): Where are (now) those partners of your make-believe? (22) Then will they have no contention save that they will say: By Allah, our Lord, we never were idolaters. (23)<br>  <br>  Say: O People of the Scripture! Come to an agreement between us and you: that we shall worship none but Allah, and that we shall ascribe no partner unto Him, and that none of us shall take others for lords beside Allah. And if they turn away, then say: Bear witness that we are they who have surrendered (unto Him). (64)<br>  <br>  O People of the Scripture! Why will ye argue about Abraham, when the Torah and the Gospel were not revealed till after him? Have ye then no sense? (65) Lo! ye are those who argue about that whereof ye have some knowledge: Why then argue ye concerning that whereof ye have no knowledge? Allah knoweth. Ye know not. (66) Abraham was not a Jew, nor yet a Christian; but he was an upright man who had surrendered (to Allah), and he was not of the idolaters. (67)<br>  <br>  In the day when Allah gathereth together the messengers, and saith: What was your response (from mankind)? they say: We have no knowledge. Lo! Thou, only Thou art the Knower of Things Hidden, (109) <br>  <br>  When Allah saith: O Jesus, son of Mary! Remember My favour unto thee and unto thy mother; how I strengthened thee with the holy Spirit, so that thou spakest unto mankind in the cradle as in maturity; and how I taught thee the Scripture and Wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel; and how thou didst shape of clay as it were the likeness of a bird by My permission, and didst blow upon it and it was a bird by My permission, and thou didst heal him who was born blind and the leper by My permission; and how thou didst raise the dead by My permission; and how I restrained the Children of Israel from (harming) thee when thou camest unto them with clear proofs, and those of them who disbelieved exclaimed: This is naught else than evident magic; (110)<br>  <br>   And when I inspired the disciples, (saying): Believe in Me and in My messenger, they said: We believe. Bear witness that we have surrendered (unto Thee). (111) When the disciples said: O Jesus, son of Mary! Is thy Lord able to send down for us a table spread with food from heaven? He said: Observe your duty to Allah, if ye are true believers. (112) <br>  <br>  (They said:) We wish to eat thereof, that we may satisfy our hearts and know that thou hast spoken truth to us, and that thereof we may be witnesses. (113) Jesus, son of Mary, said: O Allah, Lord of us! Send down for us a table spread with food from heaven, that it may be a feast for us, for the first of us and for the last of us, and a sign from Thee. Give us sustenance, for Thou art the Best of Sustainers. (114) <br>  <br>  Allah said: Lo! I send it down for you. And whoso disbelieveth of you afterward, him surely will I punish with a punishment wherewith I have not punished any of (My) creatures. (115) And when Allah saith: O Jesus, son of Mary! Didst thou say unto mankind: Take me and my mother for two gods beside Allah? he saith: Be glorified! It was not mine to utter that to which I had no right. If I had ever said it, then Thou wouldst have known it. Thou knowest what is in my mind, and I know not what is in Thy Mind. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Knower of Things Hidden? (116) <br>  <br>  I spake unto them only that which Thou commandedst me, (saying): Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord. I was a witness of them while I dwelt among them, and when Thou tookest me Thou wast the Watcher over them. Thou art Witness over all things. (117) If Thou punish them, lo! they are Thy slaves, and if Thou forgive them (lo! they are Thy slaves). Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Mighty, the Wise. (118) <br>  <br>  Allah saith: This is a day in which their truthfulness profiteth the truthful, for theirs are Gardens underneath which rivers flow, wherein they are secure for ever, Allah taking pleasure in them and they in Him. That is the great triumph. (119) Unto Allah belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is therein, and He is Able to do all things.

I am not US, I'm UK and can only empathise with the States as to 9/11.  End of.  I am a Christian whilst also being a Roman Catholic.  I have many friends of differing faiths (not religions) and we share no hatred.  You state you have read the Quran and you were raised as a Christian.  Have you read the Bible?  The Bible according to Moses holds the 10 commandments.  Do Muslims abide by the 10 commandments according to the Bible as opposed to the Qua ran?  My personal interpretation is that Jesus is the Son of God and conceived by way of Immaculate Conception.  My understanding of Muslims is that they believe in Jesus but as a prophet and not as the Son of God.  Did Allah not come into the equation some 500 years following the birth of what I believe in as Christ?<br>  <br>  Yes there is only one God.  We can all, be whatever faith we lean toward, believe in this.  At the end of the day we are to die and whilst feeling myself some animosity towards Muslims, due to original law, I cannot and will not show hatred.  We believe in what we are brought up to believe.  Finally, whatever our opinions or beliefs we should respect our fellow man for his personal choice.<br>  <br>  Sorry, one further point.  You are engaged to a Muslim and I assume you will confirm to that faith on marriage.  Would your partner convert to Christianity?

Consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced!"<br>  <br>  --John Adams<br>  <br>  Read your bible and you will see the evil and hate that it inspires...<br>  <br>  I have no idea where people get this idea that Jesus preached love and tolerance when every other page he was saying to kill and rise up...<br>  <br>   ? ? ?  Hate Your Family!  ? ? ? <br>  "If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple." (Luke 14:26)<br>  <br>  Comment<br>  This remarkable statement of hate by Jesus directly contradicts the idea of a loving Christ. If one must hate their father, mother, wife, children, brethren and sisters and even themselves, in order to become a disciple of Jesus, one must question Christ's idea love, family, and decency. (See also Luke 12:51-53, Matthew 10:34-37.)<br>  <br>  Note: A few desperate apologists attempt to dismiss this verse claiming that the word 'hate' here really doesn't mean what it says. The problem with this approach boarders on complete deception and the ironic dismissal of the Bible and Biblical scholarship. The word 'hate' here comes from the ancient Greek word 'miseo' which means hate (from the primary 'misos' [hatred]). If any synonym could substitute for this word, it would come from a word like 'detest,' 'loath,' or 'despise.' Moreover, virtually all Bibles translate the term as hate. To deny this intent means to deny the Bible and the alleged word of Jesus.<br>  <br>  ? ? ? God Slaughters Blacks ? ? ?<br>  "And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots..." (II Chronicles 14:9)<br>  <br>  So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled. (II Chronicles 14:12)<br>  <br>  Comment<br>  It appears that Black Christian Bible studies programs ignore these verses, for it says that the Lord God slaughtered over a million blacks.<br>  <br>  The association of black with evil goes far back in Western Christian culture. The early Church fathers, Origen, Jerome, and Augustine of Hippo wrote about devils appearing as Ethiopians.<br>  <br>  White racist groups (such as the Klu Klux Klan who think of themselves as opposite of black devils) see these Biblical verses as evidence to justify their beliefs. We still hear phrases such as "Prince of Darkness" or "Black magic" which link blackness with sin.<br>  <br>  ? ? ? Came Not To Send Peace ? ? ? <br>  "Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword. For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law. And a man's foes shall be they of his own household." (Matthew 10:34-37)<br>  <br>  Comment<br>  These words of Jesus confirm the unbelievable notion that Jesus did not come to establish peace, but rather to send the sword and to put man against his family. So much for family values. (See also Luke 12: 51-53, Luke 12:49 and Luke 14:26.)<br>  <br>  ? ? ? I Come To Send Fire ? ? ? <br>  "I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be already kindled?" (Luke 12:49)<br>  <br>  "Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division: For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three. The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in law." (Luke 12:51-53)<br>  <br>  Comment<br>  Jesus did not come to send peace, but rather fire and division among the family. So much for the idea of a pacifist Jesus and the modern concept of "family values." (See also Luke 14:26)<br>  <br>  ? ? ? Jesus Not Entirely Good ? ? ? <br>  "And behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life? And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments." (Matthew 19:16-17)<br>  <br>  Comment<br>  Most Christians believe that Jesus, not only lived as the Son of God but God in the flesh. Consider that Jesus here calls "none good but one, that is, God," pointing to an entity separate from himself (also see Matt. 5:48)<br>  <br>  Also note that because of the belief that none other than God "is" good suggests that Jesus must not have behaved in an entirely good manner himself.<br>  <br>  Some early Gnostic cults (judged as heretics by the orthodox church) believed Jesus as the Devil in the flesh and these verses suggests that He was the opposite of good-- Evil in the disguise of God.<br>  <br>  ? ? ? Jesus' servants would fight ? ? ? <br>  "If my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.

Do you mean having the audacity to say "Happy Holidays" as a greeting to someone when you don't know their faith?  How terrible!  Or do we attack Christians when we say that the Bible can't be taught in public schools on account of the fact that there are 10,000 religions in the world and it's not right to show preference or to teach children that all are beliefs are inferior to Christianity?<br>  <br>  Most of the "attacks" on Christianity are in fact defenses.  For some reason, Christians think that any attempt to show non-Christians respect and give them equal rights is "taking away Christians' rights."<br>  <br>  Also, keep in mind that people tend to get irritible with "Christians" who repeatedly tell them they're going to hell.

It was one of those warm muggy summer evenings and the Vicar had left the church door open. Just as he started to preach, the Salvation Army band started playing on the road outside the church. The vicar went outside and complained.

If you understood what "evolution" means, you'd realize how utterly brainless it sounds to call it a religion, since it's observed billions (yes, with a "b" - that's not a typo) of times EVERY DAY.<br>  <br>  Evolution is NOT speciation, it's NOT abiogenesis and it's NOT the Big Bang.  It's NOT "Godlessness", it's NOT atheism - it's not even anti-religious.  It's the fact that, in species requiring sex for reproduction, offspring are not clones of their parents.  Fact, not theory, not religion.  If you think you're genetically identical to your parents, you shouldn't be posting here.  Or anywhere, since the internet is intended for the use of at least semi-sapient species.<br>  <br>  But refusing to accept something that occurs is sacrilegious - it's denying the power of thought that God evidently meant you to use, since he did give you some stuff between your ears.

At this point it is already laughable that anyone would actually attempt to challenge common descent.<br>  <br>  Can you imagine the response to anyone who went around claiming atoms didn't exist?  That is how creationists are already viewed by biologists.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	Claim CA610:<br>  Evolution is a religion because it encompasses views of values and ultimate meanings.<br>  Source:<br>  Morris, Henry M. 1985. Scientific Creationism. Green Forest, AR: Master Books, pp. 196-200.<br>  Response:<br>  <br>     1. Evolution merely describes part of nature. The fact that that part of nature is important to many people does not make evolution a religion. Consider some attributes of religion and how evolution compares:<br>            * Religions explain ultimate reality. Evolution stops with the development of life (it does not even include the origins of life).<br>            * Religions describe the place and role of humans within ultimate reality. Evolution describes only our biological background relative to present and recent human environments.<br>            * Religions almost always include reverence for and/or belief in a supernatural power or powers. Evolution does not.<br>            * Religions have a social structure built around their beliefs. Although science as a whole has a social structure, no such structure is particular to evolutionary biologists, and one does not have to participate in that structure to be a scientist.<br>            * Religions impose moral prescriptions on their members. Evolution does not. Evolution has been used (and misused) as a basis for morals and values by some people, such as Thomas Henry Huxley, Herbert Spencer, and E. O. Wilson (Ruse 2000), but their view, although based on evolution, is not the science of evolution; it goes beyond that.<br>            * Religions include rituals and sacraments. With the possible exception of college graduation ceremonies, there is nothing comparable in evolutionary studies.<br>            * Religious ideas are highly static; they change primarily by splitting off new religions. Ideas in evolutionary biology change rapidly as new evidence is found. <br>  <br>     2. How can a religion not have any adherents? When asked their religion, many, perhaps most, people who believe in evolution will call themselves members of mainstream religions, such as Christianity, Buddhism, and Hinduism. None identify their religion as evolution. If evolution is a religion, it is the only religion that is rejected by all its members.<br>  <br>     3. Evolution may be considered a religion under the metaphorical definition of something pursued with zeal or conscientious devotion. This, however, could also apply to stamp collecting, watering plants, or practically any other activity. Calling evolution a religion makes religion effectively meaningless.<br>  <br>     4. Evolutionary theory has been used as a basis for studying and speculating about the biological basis for morals and religious attitudes (Sober and Wilson 1998). Studying religion, though, does not make the study a religion. Using evolution to study the origins of religious attitudes does not make evolution a religion any more than using archaeology to study the origins of biblical texts makes archaeology a religion.<br>  <br>     5. Evolution as religion has been rejected by the courts:<br>  <br>            Assuming for the purposes of argument, however, that evolution is a religion or religious tenet, the remedy is to stop the teaching of evolution, not establish another religion in opposition to it. Yet it is clearly established in the case law, and perhaps also in common sense, that evolution is not a religion and that teaching evolution does not violate the Establishment Clause. <br>  <br>        The court cases Epperson v. Arkansas, Willoughby v. Stever, and Wright v. Houston Indep. School Dist. are cited as precedent (McLean v.

ZeiPETCxaa	Well, there are the scriptures that totally go against the trinity.  <br>  Where Jesus said, "I am going to my father and your father and my God an your God.<br>  <br>  There is Col. 1:15-17 showing Christ is the firstborn of all creation by God.<br>  <br>  There is the scripture, Blessed be the God and Father of Jesus.<br>  <br>  There is the scripture, where God says this is my son the beloved, whom I have approved.  <br>  <br>  I like the one where the preacher proudly says from the scripture where Jesus says, "I and the Father are one"  But does not tell the parishioners where he later says, Let them be one just we are one." or in union or unity.<br>  <br>  AT JOHN 1:1 the King James Version reads: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." Trinitarians claim that this means that "the Word" (Greek, ho lo'gos) who came to earth as Jesus Christ was Almighty God himself.<br>  <br>  Someone who is "with" another person cannot also be that other person<br>  <br>  Note, however, that here again the context lays the groundwork for accurate understanding. Even the King James Version says, "The Word was with God." (Italics ours.) Someone who is "with" another person cannot be the same as that other person. In agreement with this, the Journal of Biblical Literature, edited by Jesuit Joseph A. Fitzmyer, notes that if the latter part of John 1:1 were interpreted to mean "the" God, this "would then contradict the preceding clause," which says that the Word was with God.<br>  <br>  Notice, too, how other translations render this part of the verse:<br>  <br>  1808:  "and the word was a god." The New Testament in an Improved Version, Upon the Basis of Archbishop Newcome's New Translation: With a Corrected Text.<br>  <br>  1864:  "and a god was the word." The Emphatic Diaglott, interlinear reading, by Benjamin Wilson.<br>  <br>  1928:  "and the Word was a divine being." La Bible du Centenaire, L'Evangile selon Jean, by Maurice Goguel.<br>  <br>  1935:  "and the Word was divine." The Bible—An American Translation, by J. M. P. Smith and E. J. Goodspeed.<br>  <br>  1946:  "and of a divine kind was the Word." Das Neue Testament, by Ludwig Thimme.<br>  <br>  1950:  "and the Word was a god." New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures.<br>  <br>  1958:  "and the Word was a God." The New Testament, by James L. Tomanek.<br>  <br>  1975:  "and a god (or, of a divine kind) was the Word." Das Evangelium nach Johannes, by Siegfried Schulz.<br>  <br>  1978:  "and godlike kind was the Logos." Das Evangelium nach Johannes, by Johannes Schneider.<br>  <br>  At John 1:1 there are two occurrences of the Greek noun the·os' (god). The first occurrence refers to Almighty God, with whom the Word was ("and the Word [lo'gos] was with God [a form of the·os']"). This first the·os' is preceded by the word ton (the), a form of the Greek definite article that points to a distinct identity, in this case Almighty God ("and the Word was with [the] God").<br>  <br>  On the other hand, there is no article before the second the·os' at John 1:1. So a literal translation would read, "and god was the Word." Yet we have seen that many translations render this second the·os' (a predicate noun) as "divine," "godlike," or "a god." On what authority do they do this?<br>  <br>  The Koine Greek language had a definite article ("the"), but it did not have an indefinite article ("a" or "an"). So when a predicate noun is not preceded by the definite article, it may be indefinite, depending on the context.<br>  <br>  The Journal of Biblical Literature says that expressions "with an anarthrous [no article] predicate preceding the verb, are primarily qualitative in meaning." As the Journal notes, this indicates that the lo'gos can be likened to a god. It also says of John 1:1: "The qualitative force of the predicate is so prominent that the noun [the·os'] cannot be regarded as definite."<br>  <br>  So John 1:1 highlights the quality of the Word, that he was "divine," "godlike," "a god," but not Almighty God. This harmonizes with the rest of the Bible, which shows that Jesus, here called "the Word" in his role as God's Spokesman, was an obedient subordinate sent to earth by his Superior, Almighty God.<br>  <br>  There are many other Bible verses in which almost all translators in other languages consistently insert the article "a" when translating Greek sentences with the same structure. For example, at Mark 6:49, when the disciples saw Jesus walking on water, the King James Version says: "They supposed it had been a spirit." In the Koine Greek, there is no "a" before "spirit." But almost all translations in other languages add an "a" in order to make the rendering fit the context. In the same way, since John 1:1 shows that the Word was with God, he could not be God but was "a god," or "divine."<br>  <br>  Joseph Henry Thayer, a theologian and scholar who worked on the American Standard Version, stated simply: "The Logos was divine, not the divine Being himself." And Jesuit John L. McKenzie wrote in his Dictionary of the Bible: "Jn 1:1 should rigorously be translated . . . 'the word was a divine being.'"<br>  <br>  Viola|`|dmTVbpcWaa	If you feel that the Trinity gives you comfort- then by all means keep on believing it.There are Millions who have passed beyond that belief and into clear spiritual light.<br>  You Quote Tertullian who was perhaps best known for his paradoxical, or seemingly contradictory, statements, such as these: “God is then especially great, when He is small.” “[The death of God’s Son] is by all means to be believed, because it is absurd.” “[Jesus] was buried, and rose again; the fact is certain, because it is impossible.”<br>  So there.|`|P6atY3xXaa	Trust me, they don't.

Capable of bringing down all bright and sunny things you have placed or tried to place of your computer.<br>  <br>  4.

It also charges for corrections that should have been made before it was released.<br>  <br>  7. 2Corinthians 11:14 explains that it is Satan who keeps transforming himself to appear as an angel of light.<br>  <br>  So I submit it is not Jesus but Satan who might be in Vista.|`|rAmhfdqkaa	all vista infected computers are going to hell.|`|QwKiK85eaa	No god isn't god doesn't exist.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	no He doesnt care about silly things..|`|YzhYFu0eaa	Yes Virginia, Jesus is in Windows Vista.

3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	The rapture of the church (born again believers in Christ) could happen any time.  I believe the great tribulation (seven year period) will not happen until after the church is taken to be with the Lord.  Why?  The bible says that the rise of the antichrist is being held back by a "hindering force".  Many scholars believe this is the working of God's holy spirit in the millions of Christians on earth.  Once that is taken away, the rise of the antichrist will most likely happen.<br>  <br>  Three and one half years of unprecedented peace will take place.  People will believe the anti christ is the answer to every problem.  Then he will stand in the temple and demand to be worshipped as God.  The second half of the tribulation will come, and this is known as God's wrath on the earth, the Christ-rejecting people, that is.  Even though Christians have been already raptured, there will be those who come to belief, but they will be martyred for their belief in Jesus during this time.<br>  <br>  At the end of the seven years, Christ will return WITH His sants (the church), and the 1,000 year reign of Jesus on earth will begin.|`|yHfsHp6naa	I can tell you all you need to know about them: It's just total nonsense.|`|6jAVElX7aa	some people believe we are already in the tribulation period, with earthquakes, nations rising up against nations, plagues, and people turning away from the true faith which is in Christ Jesus, this goes with Christ's words. "When I return will I find faith on earth?"  Then before the last trump, Christ will return take up his faithfull, and God's wrath will come on them, who blasphemed His name.|`|P5rczL0Saa	The Tribulation is first, then the Second coming and the Rapture. (Jesus has to come back so He can rapture us).<br>  Read Matthew 24. Pay close attention to vs 8,9,13,14,15,21,22,25,27,29,30,31.<br>  Also, please read 2 Thess.1:4-10 Notice that it says "since it is a righteous thing with God to repay with tribulation those who trouble you, and to give you who are troubled rest with us when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with His mighty angels, IN FLAMING FIRE, TAKING VENGEANCE ON THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW GOD, AND ON THOSE WHO DO NOT OBEY THE GOSPEL OF OUR  LORD JESUS CHRIST. These shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power, WHEN HE COMES IN THAT DAY, TO BE GLORIFIED IN HIS SAINTS AND TO BE ADMIRED AMONG ALL THOSE WHO BELIEVE, BECAUSE OUR TESTIMONY AMONG YOU WAS BELIEVED."  <br>  Please note that it says when Jesus comes back, He will be coming IN FLAMING FIRE TAKING VENGEANCE on the SAME DAY He comes back for us (the rapture).  The Biblle refers to the DAY OF THE LORD as being the DAY that the Lord returns, and it also refers to THE DAY OF THE LORD as being when He takes vengeance on those who are against Him. Same Day.<br>  Many people get this confused; the Tribulation and the Wrath of God. God's wrath is NOT the tribulation!  God's wrath is what is going to happen to those AFTER we are raptured. The WRATH is what He is going to take us out of, not the Tribulation. It will all happen in the same DAY--the DAY OF THE LORD.|`|WQvqLnnhaa	I could write out the entire book of Revelation for you if you would like.

According to the historian Josephus, Magog was the land of the nomadic Scythians, the region north and northeast of the Black Sea and east of the Caspian Sea. The area would have included territory that is occupied today by Russin, the Ukraine, and Kazakhstan. Ezekiel 38:2 also speaks of Gog as the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal. These entities could be either components of Magog or allies. Some Bible versions have also translated Rosh, not as a proper name, but as “chief.” <br>  <br>  Though the identification of Gog and Magog still remains disputed, the identifications of Meshech and Tubal have for a long time not been in doubt…. The association with Moscow and Tobolsk is untenable…. Since the late nineteenth century, Assyrian texts have been available which locate Mushku (Meshech) and Tabal (Tubal) in central and eastern Anatolia (Turkey)respectively (Yamauchi, Foes from the Northern Frontier) <br>  <br>  Another key indicator pointing to Russia the reference to Gog coming from the North. There is Lebbon and Turkey to the North Israel, but both of these nations are unable to field a massive army that could threaten Israel. <br>  <br>  <br>  Eze 38:6 Gomer, and all his bands; the house of Togarmah of the north quarters, and all his bands: [and] many people with thee. <br>  <br>  Eze 38:15 And thou shalt come from thy place out of the north parts, thou, and many people with thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great company, and a mighty army: <br>  <br>  Eze 39:2 And I will turn thee back, and leave but the sixth part of thee, and will cause thee to come up from the north parts, and will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel: <br>  <br>  <br>  Oddly enough, Moscow is directly north of Israel.

AA10024451	The Bible's principle in matters of dating/marriage is that one is to "marry.....only in the Lord", or in other words, as Jehovah's Witnesses we take that to mean that we are only to seek marriage partners within the realms of those who are dedicated and baptized members of the Christian congregation. Because we believe the purpose of dating is to find a marriage mate (and not for simple fun and recreation), we would only look for someone to date/marry from within the Christian congregation. It is NOT ok if someone chooses to purposely flout Bible principles and begin dating someone who doesn't share the same love for Jehovah or obedience to Bible morality and laws as we do. <br>  <br>  Jehovah's Witnesses who are active and regular Kingdom publishers know better than to seek potential marriage mates outside of the Christian congregation. So in all likelihood, this individual you claim to be dating is either NOT one of Jehovah's Witnesses at all........or.........he may be a very spiritually weak individual who is disregarding clear Bible counsel.....or......he is an individual living a double life (acting like a zealous Witness in the congregation and in front of other Jehovah's Witnesses, but secretly doing other things that violate Bible principles, such as dating an unbeliever).|`|g4AAZRuxaa	No I don't believe so.|`|LCZChP7Maa	2 Corinthians 6:14 reads "do not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers...."

AA11796124	FASTING<br>  A form of penance that imposes limits on the kind or quantity of food or drink. From the first century Christians have observed fasting days of precept, notably during the season of Lent in commemoration of Christ's passion and death. In the early Church there was less formal precept and therefore greater variety of custom, but in general fasting was much more severe than in the modern Church. In the East and West the faithful abstained on fasting days from wine as well as from flesh-meat, both being permitted only in cases of weak health. The ancient custom in the Latin Church of celebrating Mass in the evening during Lent was partly due to the fact that in many places the first meal was not taken before sunset. <br>  <br>  The modern Church regulations on fasting, until 1966, prescribed taking only one full meal a day, along with some food for breakfast and a collation. Days of fast and abstinence for the universal Church were Ash Wednesday, the Fridays and Saturdays of Lent, Ember days, and the vigils of certain feasts. Days of fast only were the rest of the days of Lent, except Sundays. Special indults affected different nations and were provided for by canon law. <br>  <br>  With the constitution Paenitemini of Paul VI in 1966, the meaning of the law of fasting remained, but the extent of the obligation was changed. Thus "the law of fasting allows only one full meal a day, but does not prohibit taking some food in the morning and evening, while observing approved local custom as far as quantity and quality of food are concerned." To the law of fast are bound those of the faithful who have completed their twenty-first year and up until the beginning of their sixtieth year. Prescribed bays of fast and abstinence for the whole Church are Ash Wednesday and Good Friday. Nevertheless, as with abstinence, so with fasting or other forms of penance, "It is up to the bishops, gathered in their episcopal conferences, to establish the norms . . . which they consider the most opportune and efficacious" (Paenitemini, III). In the Eastern rites it is the right of the patriarch, together with the synod or supreme authority of every rite, to determine the days of fast and abstinence in accordance with the decree of the Second Vatican Council for Eastern Churches. <br>  <br>  Matt. 9:15; Mark 2:20; Luke 5:35 - many non-Catholics frown upon the Church's pious practice of fasting, and say that fasting went away after the resurrection of Christ. But Jesus Himself says that His followers will fast once He is gone and does not object.<br>  <br>  Matt. 6:16-18 - in fact, Jesus even gives instructions on how to fast. Jesus says, "Do not look dismal like the hypocrites, but look clean and refreshed." <br>  <br>  Matt. 17-21; Mark 9:29 - Jesus teaches that only prayer and fasting had special power to cure a man possessed by a demon. Jesus teaches about the efficacy of fasting and how fasting, coupled with prayer, is acceptable and pleasing to God. <br>  <br>  Luke 2:37 - Anna the widow worshiped God with fasting and prayer night and day. The Church has always taught that, by virtue of our priesthood conferred in baptism, our fasting participates in the priesthood of Christ by atoning for the temporal punishments due to our and other people’s sins. <br>  <br>  Acts 13:2-3; 14:23 - the apostles engaged in prayer and fasting in connection with ordaining leaders of the Church. Prayer and fasting have always been the practice of the Church. <br>  <br>  1 Tim. 4:3 - when Paul refers to doctrines that require abstinence from foods, some Protestants refer to this verse to condemn the Catholic Church's practice of fasting. But Paul is referring to abstinence and any other practice that is performed apart from Christ's teachings. Fasting, on the other hand, is done in obedience to Christ's teachings of taking up our cross and following Him, by participating in His sufferings so we can share in His glory. When citing this verse, these Protestants do not explain why Jesus prophesied that his followers would fast and why Jesus gave instructions on how to fast. <br>  <br>  Ez. 8:21-23 - Ezra proclaims a fast as a prayer for humility and self-mortification and God responds. Our fasting is performed to remind us of our absolute reliance upon God. <br>  <br>  Neh. 1:4; 9:1 - these texts also show the historical practice of fasting. Fasting atones for temporal punishment due to sin and repairs our relationship with God. <br>  <br>  Tobit 12:8 - prayer is good when accompanied by fasting. Throughout salvation history, God has encouraged fasting to be coupled with prayer. <br>  <br>  Judith 4:9-13 - the people of Israel humbled themselves with fasting and the Lord Almighty responds. <br>  <br>  Esther 4:3,16 - people fasted for days to atone for sin. Although Jesus remits the eternal penalty of our sin, we can atone for temporal penalties due to our sin. <br>  <br>  Psalm 35:13 - David says, "I afflicted myself with fasting." David recognized that fasting drew him closer to God. Fasting makes us aware of our dependency on God. <br>  <br>  Psalm 69:10 - the|`|AA10676836	It is a system the catholic church started.

Away from me, you evildoers!' (NIV)<br>  <br>  Heb 10:31 <br>  It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God (NIV)|`|BAaf9NKdaa	In the Bible there is a verse that states when concerning spiritual<br>   matters of worship that involve false teachings to the sheep by the <br>   shepard class that goes like this. " Vengeance is mine says the<br>   LORD". He will set matters straight with these wolves in sheep's<br>    clothing misleading those who earnestly seek knowledge and understanding of God's arrangements.<br>    There is also a scripture that says that we are to obey Caesar,<br>   the governmental rules and regulations, until they interfere with <br>   God's rules and regulations. We are to honor those who God has <br>   left in those positions as he uses them to fulfill his will.<br>     In the case of the preacher raping the young girl he is supposedly<br>   under the same arrangement to obey Caesar. If he is found guilty of<br>   violating Caesar's laws then he is to be punished under those laws<br>   of Caesar as long as there is compelling evidence. If he is found<br>   violating Caesars law in order to remain loyal to God's instructions<br>   then he is innocent and the same punishment will be ask of those <br>   who may take his life by their judgment.....a preacher who would rape <br>   must fall under Caesars domain of justice....as to what is required for <br>   the offense.....|`|dinQqpODaa	Galatians 6:7|`|KaiPyNx6aa	Nope|`|8lnr5DeTaa	As a great man once said, life is like a lollipop.

vvgmyX04aa	You certainly have a right to be angry. <br>  <br>  I don't know about feeling betrayed because I don't know the circumstances but I don't really see how it could be a betrayal if she just didn't tell you before about a very important but still personal part of her own life.<br>  <br>  After all, when you are starting to see someone, there are probably things you don't feel you want to share with them, at least not at the start.<br>  <br>  <br>  And again I don't know the circumstances of you learning this about her but if I may ask, would you be upset if she told you?<br>  <br>  <br>  (btw, I don't mean to criticise or judge you because I know I wouldn't be comfortable with the thought of dating someone who had changed sex.)|`|kU5Xv2i2aa	Yes she should have told you.

Would you rather love a lie yet never know it even after death? Or would you rather know the truth so that you can move on with your life (assuming you do move on with your life) in whatever the future brings (stay with her or move on)?<br>  <br>  Some people feel angry and feel betrayed. <br>  <br>  Others don't. It is sometimes assumed that the person they "thought" they knew is still there. It's just that in the past, that person lived a different life; the love they have is strong enough to overcome this obstacle.<br>  <br>  Is it "right" to feel angry and betrayed? Well, I'm not you nor do I know all of the circumstances. Just because she told you doesn't completely tell us the story. There are always circumstances, unique to each person. I can't tell you if it's "right" to feel angry and betrayed after gaining such knowledge of that person. However I can tell you that it's hard for anyone to tell those who they love deep secrets like this.<br>  <br>  You find out who people really are when secrets like this come out in the open. I wonder what she thinks of you at this moment right now in the world.|`|7t4A5BRDaa	I would be upset by that. What did she say when you confronted her?|`|cfdaa128dfa2a07a157aa79c35d7f3abaa	She did not lie to you. You have no right to know. She was born with a birth defect. Before God, a transsexual woman *IS* a woman. Why should you punish her because of her birth defect? All you have a right to know about her medical history is that she currently lacks a penis.<br>  <br>  It is not a trust issue, since NOBODY has a right to know if someone else is a TS, just like nobody has a right to know a CIA agent's secrets. See, TSs were born with a birth defect. The whole idea of correcting it is so nobody will know and so they can have the SAME rights as other women. The fact that you are mad shows that you think women with this birth defect are inferior to other women. Without your notions of inferiority between women, you would not care. The whole idea behind transition is so NOBODY will know, so they will have the exact same treatment. Why is your need to know more important than her right to be treated 100% as any other born female every single day and for nobody to ever know?<br>  <br>  And why the double standard. If it is wrong to expect any other woman to go around saying she was wrongly born with a penis, then why expect that of a woman with this condition? Once anyone knows, they never treat the person the same way as before, thus making all the money and time they spent becoming undetectable become waste.<br>  <br>  Maybe the father will get his for immorally sharing what nobody has a right to know. You are talking about trust, and you had to be the one to snoop and to automatically believe what you heard. So who should feel betrayed?<br>  <br>  The only way to really get TS women their rights is to make it a felony to disclose anything about these women (even by the TS herself) and felony to even ask. TSs are only harmed by disclosures, unlike the TG male who keeps his penis for life, and the LGBT members who are proud of being different and have a need for victimization.|`|WrdqwbTsaa	Yes, you are right!  That person led you on and lied to you.  I would feel the same way too.  You have a right to know who you are dating and you have the right to decide whether or not you want to date someone who used to be biologically male.|`|7sO3tfSIaa	I would be upset by that as well.|`|rDFnsFf2aa	yeah.

wnsFO3GCaa	Investigative reporters have been castrated in recent years. Big and powerful networks, privacy and confidentiality laws, pocket officials and vulgar amounts of money changing hands have severely limited what reporters can do.<br>  <br>  Marcia: You are very misinformed. Less newspapers are being sold but hits on news websites are triple the highest amount of newspapers ever sold. Journalists aren't given a free license when it comes to reporting. The big corporation bosses (baby boomers) tell journalists what story to report on and what spin to put on it. The boomer journalists could put the truth in papers because their bosses (proper seniors) had integrity which the bb lack. If you don't write a story how the bosses want you to write it it goes out the window, never gets printed and you are out of a job. <br>  <br>  Independant journalism is bigger now than it was in 60s, 70s or 80s. The internet has helped with this a lot. The majority of independant journalists don't make any money and hardly ever get heard because they don't have the same exposure as the large corps.

However they also rely on advertising revenue, but are for the most part unbiased. <br>  <br>  I used to work for a major newspaper in Canada, had a front page column and everything was censored according to Political views of the owners.  We were also not able to write or publish articles that didnt pay off in terms of advertising revenue for the paper.  An article I wrote on YTV who were shooting a movie in the city was axed because there was no "pay off".  <br>  <br>  Journalists these days get their stories off the wire feed, they are too lazy and too cowed to do more than that. If they do any investigative reporting they usually cant find anyone who will publish it.   News sources pander to the public, to political affiliations, to big business and ethical reporting is almost a thing of the past.<br>  <br>  Reuters is one news source that generally goes beyond the limitations and prints the real story, as much as they are able to.  It is also one news source hated and maligned by the Bush administration.<br>  <br>  I have read or heard news stories that are so biased and so false and are nothing more than political propaganda. <br>  <br>  The Bush administration was a perfect example of this.

Even the way the US used information garnered from the broken Japanese codes was well done.  The Japanese never caught on and never even suspected we were reading them.

xvey8ixPaa	My family lis Christian and we practice it as Lutherans. My husband never give sup anything. My daughter usually does. I do about every other year. This year she and I are giving up refined sugar, added sugar. So, that is a hard one. No candy, no cookies, no sugar cereal, no sugar in coffee tea. Nothing desserty. So, I am having spenda in my coffee like I usually do, but eating a dried peach half instead of a cookie! Not bad and not bad for you. One year she gave up makeup (as a teen that was hard!) and another year she gave up her high heels, (once again that is hard as a teen) She now uses less makeup and never wnet back to her high heels and she is 20 now. I will pledge to give something up if my heart is truely in it as a sacrifice. I do not give up stuff just to do it, it has to be something I am dedicated to. So, this is it. A lame one and one a lot of people do, but when it comes to it, we do indulge in sweets in our household a lot so this puts a big change in our day, which is what we are looking for as part of our Lent observance.

I know this much, that the translators in King James day had the Majority Texts..handed to them from the Waldenses, who were besieged and murdered by other religious leaders of the current age.. and that redundancy played an important role in determining what was considered sacred and what was poetry and history not inspired..also the style of writing, the author's usage of words were all compared and then put together. They looked for consistency and similar meanings, and similar words and phrases.. You see the Hebrew language is the most difficult to understand..and it takes a real hebrew language specialist to understand the ancient texts..the skill necessary for this was always around and passed from generation to generation..so it is a complex process but very doable with the right knowledge.. remember the scriptures are as old as 4000 years, Genesis was written by Moses..and some books have been dated back before that such as JOB,   so, go to that website or Amazing Discoveries.. both of the keynote speakers are from Jewish families, now Christians..Steve Wohlberg and Doug Bachelor.. good luck..|`|qLItxaiDaa	Bible Scholars say, "Its Changed"<br>  What Does the Real "Word of God" Say?<br>  <a href="http://www.islamcode.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamcode.com/</a><br>  <br>  Watch Video Priests and preachers entering Islam<br>  <a href="http://www.islamhouse.com/p/191706" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamhouse.com/p/191706</a><br>  <br>  Did Jesus Claim to be God?<br>  <a href="http://www.islamnewsroom.com/content/view/29/52/" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamnewsroom.com/content/vie...</a><br>  <br>  Jesus in the Quran?<br>  Muhammad in the Bible?<br>  <a href="http://www.islamnewsroom.com/content/view/24/52/" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamnewsroom.com/content/vie...</a><br>  <br>  Bible Compared to Quran<br>  <a href="http://www.islamtomorrow.com/articles/Bible_vs_Quran.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamtomorrow.com/articles/Bi...</a><br>  <br>  Quran or Bible: What's The Difference?<br>  <a href="http://www.islamnewsroom.com/content/view/51/52/" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamnewsroom.com/content/vie...</a><br>  <br>  Why Do Muslims Reject "Perfect Salvation Thru Jesus?"<br>  <a href="http://www.islamnewsroom.com/content/view/27/52/" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamnewsroom.com/content/vie...</a><br>  <br>  Did Isaiah 42 (Bible) Describe Muhammad?<br>  <a href="http://www.islamnewsroom.com/content/view/382/52/" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamnewsroom.com/content/vie...</a><br>  <br>  Watch Video Priests and preachers entering Islam<br>  <a href="http://www.islamhouse.com/p/191706" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamhouse.com/p/191706</a>|`|nPmnAXjUaa	told to inflict fear on primitive people in order to control society.|`|EBGdlo35aa	OK - the most important events in this process are<br>  a) the festal letter of Athanaius in 375 C.E.<br>  b) the synod of Hippo in 393 C.E.<br>  c) the council of Carthage in 397 C.E.<br>  <br>  Another council you may consider important is the council of Laodicea, 363 C.E.

FhXzlnDOaa	What's to change?  Israel exists.  Support it.|`|zBqt99avaa	Yes.  It is.  [sorry for the wall of text]<br>  <br>  Previously, all I knew about Israel was propaganda.  But I kept hearing things from Muslim friends that sounded very different from the news.  At first, I dismissed it as bigotry.  But over time, I came to realize that many of these people weren't bigots towards any other group.  Further, they weren't bigots against Jews, but Israelis only.<br>  <br>  Being me, I'm not easily swayed by anyone's arguements, especially if I think they might have an agenda.  No offense, but the numerous calls against Israel and Jews in general by many, many Muslims worldwide makes it hard for someone to trust a Muslim when they speak out against Israel.<br>  <br>  One night I was watching Al Jazeera English at Mustafa's with his sister.  This guy, a reporter and author, came on to have a debate with some American jerk on "Inside Iraq".  He was eloquent, and even tempered, despite how much the American insulted him.  I looked him up:  Robert Fisk.  <br>  <br>  Mr. Fisk has a great book titled:  The Great War for Civilisation: The Conquest of the Middle East.  It's loooong but informative, interesting and well researched.  Much of its contents comes from his personal experience of living and reporting from the middle east for over 30 years.  He's British and Christian, and so has very little reason to lie or distort facts.  Because he's a reporter (a real one, not a talking head) he states facts as facts and opinions as opinions.  This makes it easy for the reader to draw their own conclusions.  It totally opened my eyes.<br>  <br>  It's a great book to help brush up on western foreign policy over the last few decades, and really helps a western person understand what's going on and why.  It's fairly recently published (2005) so it's relatively current.  And it gets into the whole Palestinian-Israeli conflict on a person-to-person as well as political level.<br>  <br>  I also recently read "My Father's Paradise" by Jewish writer Ariel Sabah. It chronicals his family's life in Kurdistan of Iraq, to Israel, to California.  It's interesting to see how a Jew in a Muslim land was treated pre-Israel.  And even post-Israel, when he and his dad return to his village/city.  Certainly not the way the media is trying to tell us they were treated.<br>  <br>  For the record, I've nothing against the Jews having a Jewish state.  I think it's a great idea.  What they suffered during the Holocaust cannot be denied and should not be allowed to happen again.  To anyone.  That includes the Palestinians.<br>  <br>  The Zionists were offered land in the Sudan.  If they want desert, the US has lots of under-used desert in Nevada; it would even save the US millions (billions?) in aid and security costs currently given or spent on Israel.

51fe01ef6db0c1bd743afcb3e7a2e1ffaa	Wrong, Mr John.<br>  <br>  The liturgical use of ashes originates in Old Testament times. Ashes symbolized mourning, mortality and penance. <br>  <br>  Jesus Himself also made reference to ashes. Referring to towns that refused to repent of sin although they had witnessed the miracles and heard the good news, our Lord said, "If the miracles worked in you had taken place in Tyre and Sidon, they would have reformed in sackcloth and ashes long ago" (Mt 11:21). <br>  <br>  <br>  The early Church continued the usage of ashes for the same symbolic reasons. In his book, De Poenitentia, Tertullian (c. 160-220) prescribed that the penitent must "live without joy in the roughness of sackcloth and the squalor of ashes." Eusebius (260-340), the famous early Church historian, recounted in his The History of the Church how an apostate named Natalis came to Pope Zephyrinus clothed in sackcloth and ashes begging forgiveness. Also during this time, for those who were required to do public penance, the priest sprinkled ashes on the head of the person leaving confession. <br>  <br>  In the Middle Ages (at least by the time of the eighth century), those who were about to die were laid on the ground on top of sackcloth sprinkled with ashes. The priest would bless the dying person with holy water, saying, "Remember that thou art dust and to dust thou shalt return." After the sprinkling, the priest asked, "Art thou content with sackcloth and ashes in testimony of thy penance before the Lord in the day of judgment?" To which the dying person replied, "I am content." In all of these examples, the symbolism of mourning, mortality and penance is clear. <br>  <br>  <br>  Eventually, the use of ashes was adapted to mark the beginning of Lent, the 40-day preparation period (not including Sundays) for Easter. The ritual for the "Day of Ashes" is found in the earliest editions of the Gregorian Sacramentary, which dates at least to the eighth century. About the year 1000, an Anglo-Saxon priest named Aelfric preached: "We read in the books, both in the Old Law and in the New, that the men who repented of their sins bestrewed themselves with ashes and clothed their bodies with sackcloth. Now let us do this little at the beginning of our Lent that we strew ashes upon our heads to signify that we ought to repent of our sins during the Lenten fast." As an aside, Aelfric reinforced his point by then telling of a man who refused to go to Church on Ash Wednesday and receive ashes; the man was killed a few days later in a boar hunt. Since this time, the Church has used ashes to mark the beginning of the penitential season of Lent, when we remember our mortality and mourn for our sins. <br>  <br>  In our present liturgy for Ash Wednesday, we use ashes made from the burned palm branches distributed on the Palm Sunday of the previous year. The priest blesses the ashes and imposes them on the foreheads of the faithful, making the sign of the cross and saying, "Remember, man you are dust and to dust you shall return," or "Turn away from sin and be faithful to the Gospel."|`|AA10057370	catholic:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=ash%20wednesday%20catholic">http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=ash%20w...</a>

When I think to take a really hard look at this, I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that it comes back to me ten-fold, just like Jesus said it would.

XLXncQu9aa	For some reason I feel that working with nature would be a great community activity.  I believe that you can accomplish two things by working with nature.  The first is that you will present a good activity that will involve you and other teens like yourself.  Secondly you will create an awareness that is linked to our environment.  You will promote having a good and clean environment.  When I say nature, I mean you could plant trees in your neighborhood, or you could clean up trash in your area.  This is helpful because it brings people together of various ages with one goal, and that is to beautify your area.  It helps you to meet new people and it gives you all common purpose.  Try those ideas.  Or you could sponsor a food or clothing drive for those less fortunate.<br>  <br>  Edit: Well if you are looking for something to keep them out of trouble, you may want to do sports activities that can be used to raise money for a good cause.  Sports is an activity that can keep kids out of trouble, all you need is a sponsor and a good cause.

QVKWVValaa	Of your choices, I believe by intellect. Believing I will fall to the ground if I trip, or that my light will turn on when I flip the switch, are examples of believing by intellect. Why I believe by intellect is that my beliefs have been repeatedly tested and consistent results warrant a logical belief in them.<br>  Believing by spirit, or what should more accurately be called FAITH, is believing in something without question, evidence and/or logical to believe. That is why I don't believe by spirit.<br>  Faith and belief are two different things.

As it does not, then it seems like Anosh is the one on attack mode........<br>  <br>  <br>  I know of one girl whose parent's arranged a marriage for her....She is not happy, does not love her husband, resents her parents, and is depressed about the life she feels she is missing. Her husband is also cheating on her, with the wife of a relative, but the girl doesn't mind, because it keeps him away from her. That being said, of course not all arranged marriages turn out like that. I am sure there are many where the couple grows to love each other. I, personally, do not believe in arranged marriages, and would never do that to my children.|`|e9Q51Oxyaa	Have you ever seen Arab women? THEY'RE HAIRY! Men cheat on them to maintain their dignity.
WlywfjG1aa	Addiction to some extent is good if it is going to result in something positive and Creative. But addiction of bad things is obviously bad. In your question you have referred to addiction to movies. One example is seeing pornographic movies ,watching pornographic movies in limited sense may not be bad if your age permits it , but if you start feeling guilty about it and still like it you may get confused and get addicted. So having firmness in your views and focusing on something imaginative and creative is the best solution to get over this addiction.|`|R2iCzRjsaa	Pretty much the same as the program for other "addictions"; although this is really a habit, not an addiction.  Do it "One Day at a Time".  If you fail, start over, and count the days that you have not used the bad words.  Soon, you'll be proud how many days you've had free of this nasty and revoluting habit!<br>  <br>  People judge others by how they present themselves and the way you speak is part of that.  It IS important.  Good Luck.|`|Wscsgyd5aa	Your not talking about addictions your talking about bad habits. It takes 17 days to form or break a habit.

I've messed with it too much in the past, made my own out of paper and a clear cassette case. <br>  What it does is opens a door to a lower level spirit realm -- spirits you DON'T want coming into your space that have lower energies and attachments dragging them down.  They will either have a door opened to come into your space from then on, or some may even become trapped in your space, haunting you.  <br>  It's never ever good to mess with these boards.  No matter who says they claim they know how to protect, whatever, there's no control.  <br>  Better to ditch the idea, the urge to play.  It's not a game.<br>  I won't even go into what it's caused, serious stuff you'll only be tempted to try it.<br>  <br>  EDIT: And yes, activity comes more easily to those who are more open to these things, more in tune.  It doesn't work as well for just people who aren't in tune.  So especially for someone like me, we need to avoid it.|`|OgaJqkSQaa	They can work, but someone naturally attuned to the spirit world would have to be involved. Most people can't get them to work. But I'd advise against it. I know someone who had a really bad experience with one and you can end up quite traumatised. The kind of spirits who respond to ouija boards are usually on a low plane and not the sort of energy you'd want to mess around with.<br>  <br>  I really would recommend against it.|`|BQ0y50Nvaa	No board game made in China out of plastic and cardboard by Mattel will cause any spiritual harm. I strongly advise you both to play it, were it only because you need to see with your own 2 eyes how gullible you are being in believing this bull.<br>  <br>  EDIT: "a door to a lower level spirit realm"... great example of what the human "gullibility gene" will do.|`|BhEsZMG8aa	They do exist, but they don't do anything magical.|`|gqaZP4R3aa	i want 2 try it 2. butt i heard u mite get possesed becuzz yur opening doorways on the other side butt i aint sure if datz tru or not. butt have fun

If you were right then most of the Bible's central message would be a giant lie. Church's would be giving false information and lying. They all state that the only way to forgiveness and Heaven is through Jesus. Faith in Jesus is the one and only way.<br>  Read John 3:16,  Ephesians 2:2-11,  Romans3:8 there are many, many, more saying about the same thing. If it isn't through Jesus that a person goes to Heaven,  then how is it done?  Good works? How many good works is enough?  Jesus did pay the punishment for our sins and He is the only way of salvation.  Ask any major denomination preacher and he/she will tell you the same.

Many "black" Americans that obviously have white blood in them (very light skinned with straight hair - Hally Berry being an example) would be considered black by mainstream America.  If such people went to an African country, Kenya for example, they would not be considered the same.  I have no problem saying he is a biracial man (which is often a reflection of "black" in America - as most don't look like they are from Africa).  For some reason or another, people think this is something below being black or white, even if it is the EXACT truth.|`|qCr1dNspaa	Neither/Both<br>  <br>  He's mixed.  I never heard of any legal standards regarding a child's race determined by the mother.|`|DfDss68haa	Biracial people can choose the race they want, there is no law about that. I know, I am biracial. And nobody says you have to take your mother's race anymore, that is an outdated "law" created for slavery becuase BW/WM offsprings were sadly common during these times. We all know about the rape. And even sicker, when the black slave woman gave birth, the child was stuck as a slave by law becuase it had to take the mothers' race. They felt safe making this law becuase how many black men slaves do you think were allowed to touch white women? Not many.<br>  <br>   That "mother's race is the child's race" law along with ODR (one drop rule) is a product of slavery and trying to keep biracial and multiracial people as slaves, do you really want to endorse it?<br>  <br>  President Obama is biracial black/white. He has chosen to identify as black and people need to respect that. Anybody who says he can't do that has no idea how biracial people have been seen for centuries in America and how the identification process works. He is a biracial man and he is a black man. Embrace it, accept it.|`|0rDDPTi5aa	Technically, yes, he is biracial, but he identifies himself as black.  Look at the history of this country.  Barack Obama was born in the 1960's, the view on race back then was:  biracials = black.  Whether people like it or not, no whites only club in the world would have let him in because of his white mother, they would have looked at his skin and kicked him out.  That is why so many older biracial people identify themselves as black, that is the cultural identity they relate to and many grew up being viewed like that.|`|rUgC7SPsaa	Barack Obama is biracial.

Good luck.|`|kVcy1VRyaa	For me, it isn't anything to do with sex (at least on a conscious level). No, it's just when I'm with another guy I feel warm and happy.

GMFXD1ENaa	Well, I think I can understand how it would seem like this from a Christian's point of view; because you believe the New Testament to be the word of G-d, then it would seem odd that someone wouldn't believe that Jesus is both the messiah and divine. But with all due respect to you and your beliefs, we don't hold the New Testament to be the word of G-d. That's not to say that it doesn't contain praiseworthy ideas/values, but we believe that G-d is One. Also, the Christian adaptation of the Hebrew Bible (the Old Testament in Christianity) is translated differently and therefore seems to show that Jesus is the messiah; however, the direct translation from Hebrew does not demonstrate that Jesus fulfilled any of the prophecies regarding the messiah.<br>  <br>  In no way am I trying to convert you; this isn't something that Jews do. Rather, I'm just trying to explain things from our perspective. I think that Christianity is a huge asset to our world, you know. We may not agree when it comes to theology, but our values are much the same. And because so many forces in this world oppose Christians and Jews, we need to stand up for each other. It's SO important.<br>  <br>  By the way, I like the idea of discussion as opposed to argument -- the anger and bitterness on this site gets so old, so this is a breath of fresh air. lol.|`|AA12245463	You know, I am beginning to agree with Mr. John's arrogant assertion, "Generally Jews cannot believe because they were blinded by God for sometime until the time of the gentiles is finished."<br>  <br>  Indeed, I do seem to be blind to the universal peace on earth delivered by the Christian messiah....<br>  <br>  "Why would anyone deny that Jesus is God's Son?"<br>  We don't.  We are all God's children.  What makes Jesus any different from the hundreds of other Jews hanging from crosses on the streets of Jerusalem?<br>  .|`|pSS1xPknaa	In short, Jesus was not the Jewish Messiah. He wasnt even a good candidate. We have a number of requirements and he fulfilled none of them except for being Jewish.<br>  <br>  If you want to change the definition of what your Messiah is or isnt, have at it. But we came up with the idea of Messiah, so don't tell us how we should define our Messiah.<br>  <br>  And don't quote the New Testament as an argument. Thats your addendum to our complete scripture, not ours.<br>  <br>  edit: To Mr. John. There are absolutely zero Jews that believe in Jesus. None, Nada, Zilch. If you believe in Jesus, you aint Jewish. If you are Jewish, you do not believe in Jesus. Real simple.|`|TVJsOEKNaa	The New Testament books have nothing to do with Judaism - It isn't a part of our Holy texts. <br>  <br>  We follow the Tanach, which is a compilation of Torah (first five books of Moses), Nevi'im (Prophets) and Ketuvhim (Writings), along with the Talmud or Oral Laws. <br>  <br>  Jesus has nothing to do with Judaism, because he failed to fulfill the messianic prophecies. Texts that claim the Divinity of Jesus are not a part of our religion, beliefs or books.<br>  <br>  You can learn about which books we use here: <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/torah.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewfaq.org/torah.htm</a><br>  <br>  Let me be adamantly clear about something: NO Jews believe in Jesus. Groups like "Jews for Jesus" and "Messianic Jews" are Christian Evangelicals set to convert all Jews to Christianity through deceptive methods. No branch of Judaism excepts them.<br>  <br>  If someone takes up a belief in Jesus: They are forfeiting their Jewishness and becoming an apostate to the religion. <br>  <br>  Secondly, Judaism is not a race -- It is a religion. I don't know why people here stated this, but it is factually incorrect. There are people of all races and ethnic backgrounds who are Jewish.<br>  <br>  It is important to note that the OT and Tanach are not the same when making theological comparisons the same way the OT/NT and the Qu'ran are not the same. It is also important to note that none of these prophecies include anything about a "second" coming.<br>  <br>  Here are some translation differences:<br>  <br>  Psalm 22:17: "Hikifuni ca'ari yaday veraglay"<br>  Means: "They bound me like a lion my hands and my feet"<br>  Christian translation: "They pierced my hands and feet"<br>  <br>  Nowhere in the Tanach do the words ca'ari or hikifuny mean anything resembling the word pierce.<br>  <br>  Isaiah 7:14: "Hinei ha'almah harah veyoledet ben"<br>  Means: "Behold the young woman is pregnant & shall give birth to a son."<br>  Christian translation: "Behold a virgin shall give birth."<br>  <br>  In Hebrew, 'ha' means 'the' and 'almah' refers to young woman. Betulah is Hebrew for virgin and is used in the Torah.<br>  <br>  The term mashiach literally means anointed one and refers to the practice of anointing kings with oil when they took the throne. The word does not mean savior. Every King/High Priest was anointed with oil, each being referred to as a mashiach/messiah.<br>  <br>  We believe the messiah will be:<br>  -------------<br>  <br>  -From the line of David on his fathers side (Jeremiah 23,5)<br>  *If Jesus was the product of a virgin birth, he couldn't have been from David's line on his father's side genetically.<br>  <br>  -Observant of Torah commandments (Isaiah 11,2-5)<br>  *It's noted that Jesus didn't observe some commandments: "He does not observe Shabbat!" (John 9:14)<br>  <br>  -A normal human who doesn't possess supernatural abilities<br>  *Jesus supposedly had supernatural abilities.<br>  <br>  - Born of human parents<br>  *Jesus was a product of a virgin birth..Not two parents*<br>  <br>  What the messiah will do:<br>  --------------<br>  -Bring political and spiritual redemption to the Jewish people<br>  *Are Jewish people in political/spiritual redemption? No.<br>  <br>  -Bring all Jews into Israel (Is:11-12; Jer:23,3; Hosea 3,4-5)<br>  *Are all Jewish people in Israel? No (I'm in NYC ;))<br>  <br>  -Establish a Torah based government in Israel (Is: 2,2-4; 11)<br>  *Israel is a democracy, not a theocracy.<br>  <br>  - Rebuild the third Temple (Ezekiel 37:26-28)<br>  *Is the third temple rebuilt? No.<br>  <br>  - Re-establish worship in the Temple (Jeremiah 33,18)<br>  *Are people worshiping in the rebuilt Temple? No.<br>  <br>  - Usher in an era of world peace (Isaiah 2:4)<br>  (The end of all hatred, oppression, suffering and disease)<br>  *Do we still have hatred/oppression/suffering/disease? Yes.<br>  <br>  - Lead the Jewish people to full Torah observance.<br>  *Are all of the Jewish people fully Torah observant? No.<br>  <br>  All commandments in Judaism remain binding forever: Anyone who comes to change them is identified as a false prophet (Deut 13:1-4).<br>  <br>  In the NT Jesus contradicts Torah and states its commandments are no longer applicable (John 1:45, 9:16, Acts 3:22, 7:37)<br>  <br>  As you can see, because these requirements are not fulfilled: The Messiah has not come yet, according to our beliefs.<br>  <br>  If you would like to learn more about Judaism: Feel free to check out the links provided below.|`|fER8XF68aa	Because the fictional deity in your fictional book doesn't meet the "prophesies" in their fictional book.<br>  .|`|f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	Judaism does not consider Jesus the messiah because Jesus failed the messianic prophecies.

We will NEVER worship anyone but G-d. <br>  <br>  Also you may want to note that the Jewish moshiach will never be the same as the xian messiah.  Our moshiach will be a human being and will not be worshiped.  So, quoting the NT has no effect on us since we do not believe in it.<br>  <br>  It's also important to say that no Jew would EVER worship Jesus.

He can be your Messiah but he is not our Messiah.  In fact, the Messiah is not a very important concept of Judaism.  There are 13 Articles of Faith in Judaism and the one about the Messiah coming is number 12.  I know that's hard for Christians to understand given that the Messiah is the central point in Christianity.  Living a righteous and good life here on earth and doing good works is the focus in Judaism and not what will happen after we die.
