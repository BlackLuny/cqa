ajd3FYNLaa	cute boots, flats, sneakers, flip flops ! :)|`|9D6Y4dYuaa	Hi there!<br>  <br>  Well, first off...I admire your style because I personally love skinny jeans. And second, there are plenty of shoes that look good with them. The real question is, what the environment will be like when you are wearing them. Will it be night? Is it winter, summer? Lucky for you— I have an answer to all of these!<br>  <br>  If it's during the day, I probably wouldn't recommend any type of closed toe heel. Instead, try a cute Gladiator sandal that's flat. This is a really popular style right now and it's ultra chic. Plus there are normally backs to these, so they should be school safe. If it's cold out, go with a pair of stylish UGGs. They are comfortable, easy to walk in, and come in a variety of colors. <br>  <br>  And I know getting a pair of shoes for free sounds crazy...but sites like 1freestuff.com has offers for free gift cards and promotions. The surveys and sign up process is a bit of a pain, but totally worth it! I got $250 in gift cards to get a pair of free UGGs...I wear them with everything. <br>  <br>  Now night time is a different story. If it's still summer time, peep toe heels are the ultimate accessory to a pair of skinny jeans. You don't have to get anything that has sky high heels. I love kitten heels...they are easy to walk in, but still lengthen your legs. Or a pair of wedges can offer style and balance. If it's heading towards winter, try a pair of ankle boots, skinny jeans lay into them nicely. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped and send me an e-mail if you find a pair of shoes that are worth trying with skinny jeans. I'm always looking for new styles to wear! Good luck.<br>  <br>  Rock on!|`|2sEbsyEhaa	this list of shoes are from like last year but they all look fine just depends on your style|`|yxxGpJnDaa	sneakers Or anything in flats|`|Tvzft8BFaa	macbeth's <br>  or cute flats always look great|`|b4Ha48Avaa	uggs, vans, converse, rocketdogs, flats,|`|7GiCzBfKaa	minnetonka boots.<br>  totally in, cheap and all the celebs are wearing them|`|TmgEbCrZaa	high chuck taylors, or just any high shoes, but not gothic shoes..<br>  if you were a guy, id say nike high(dunk, vandals, terminators, ect)|`|0abc1407c77bcca0f69ee6911b4ca124aa	It depends if you're a girl or a guy.|`|8jY4JUw7aa	flats|`|jd1xh6Lhaa	uggs.<br>  vans
ajd3FYNLaa	ahh, i love them both ! <br>  <br>  super cutee .<br>   <br>  with the first onee i would wear silver or blue accessories with blue floral pattern flats, i'm not sure how silver shoes would look with that dress, it might be a little odd.. but flats would definitely look amazing with that dress.  black tights would be okay tooo, except if you're gonna wear brown accessories, you should prolly wear brown tights, just to make it look together. jacket ? depends on what colors you have on.. i would wear a gray pullover sweater with it, its a concert & prolly gonna get pretty hot in there, & a sweater is warm, but not too warm, & you can always take it off & still keep track of it. jackets are big sometimes :)<br>  <br>  with the second onee, pink or red would look amazing, unless you dont like them, or you wanna look moree formal ? pink or red accessories, like a loong chunky necklace & matching bracelet, & heels or flats, they would both look good with it. blue & green & yellow & purple would also look good with that dress :)  ORR. you could also just wear plain black or plain white things, white heels would look good with it :) a white jacket or a white pullover sweater would look good until you got there, you'll wanna take it off :)<br>  hair ?  how loong is it ?<br>  i would curl it, makee it wavy, it would look soo amazing:)|`|IsFHBShoaa	2nd dress much better<br>  pair it off with some nice red flats<br>  & some red bangles<br>  & red pearls necclace!!!<br>  awesome|`|2PDBxlYDaa	I like the first one. Its more fashionable.|`|7GiCzBfKaa	the first one with black tights.<br>  or u could wear a plain little black dress with purple tights.<br>  you should put a belt on it, a black one.<br>  you should wear these sexy black heels.<br>  and then a plain cardigan.|`|ixmaM395aa	The first dress is so cute. Wear that with the black tights, some cute brown flats and a brown weaved belt, relaxed messy hair and some wooden bangles.|`|8jY4JUw7aa	2 is way better looking, skinny jeans,flats,bracelets|`|OeQbs95Naa	they are both super boring but if i have to choose id say the first one. The second one dont do anything to complement.|`|4a2033882f8c92f07b1c66683d6f5578aa	you could wear a nice scarf  or wear a nice hoodie  and some matching earings and bracelets or bangles and a long loose necklace
xB2wRYYBaa	generally lobes will shink back if only gone to 0g or 2g(8mm)|`|XaYHMNusaa	Honestly, 10g isn't even that large [2.59 millimeters] so I really don't think you'd be able to tell you stretched.  Some people's holes close, some don't.  It's something to be taken into consideration when you begin stretching...that it could be a permanent modification.

PtqN5WM3aa	If she had it done years ago and they haven't grown back, her only option is pencils or tattooing. I have seen people with very sparse, or nonexistant, eyebrows with tattoo's and they look great. Get a competent cosmetician to do it and they will look great. However, she needs to remember that these things are permanent, so she can't keep changing her mind. There;'s only so much that can be done. xx|`|qbZrYbFUaa	If she's lucky, she may be one of the people who don't experience the 0% regrowth promise they often flaunt to draw people in. Other than that I have never heard of anything to regrow the hair that was removed. They have eyebrow extensions and pencils but that's really about all I have heard about.

kCdISEGqaa	Not sure how it is in the UK, but, in the US, in most states, you have to show proof of an apprenticeship before you can get a license to tattoo.  When I opened my shop, I had to go through states licensing tests, a second time, pass health codes, and pass building codes.  There is a lot to it, and you can't just open a shop to open a shop.  Do you currently work in a shop for someone else?  Are you licensed?|`|1kSRPadaaa	personally to start off i would try and get work in an established tattoo studio. this will gain you valuable experience in how a business works, will give you experience and a good clientele. <br>  <br>  you need to know how to sustain a business as well as tattooing and working somewhere will be the best thing for this|`|crHWAoaWaa	You just need some ink and a rusty metal sharp object. Just kidding! <br>  You need to contact your states consumer affairs department and they should give you details about licensing and insurance requirement.|`|Yc6eUIW9aa	If you have the equipment, rent a studio and get to work.<br>  ..|`|8lHsOVxqaa	Well, I know someone here in the states who owns a Tat Studio.<br>  <br>  So, where you're at, I'd say go to your (if that's what they call it over there) City Hall. Ask them what steps to take in getting a permit (after you found a location, and landed it). Ask them for the numbers to<br>  call for inspections, get licensed, and you'll also have to call an inspector for the shop, and to also make sure a Health Inspector is paid to make sure your shop is tip top and sound for using the equipment you ahve on people.<br>  <br>  There are a lot of procedures you'll have to go through. Believe you me, I will not lie. Most definitely ask your city hall all the info you need in order to get things rolling for you.<br>  <br>  You may also have to (depending on how they do it in your area) check the building codes, to make sure that particular code is allowing the opening of a Tat Shop.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|j7HeuFeVaa	You need to contact your local city authorities, tell them of your plans and they'll send you out a brochure explaining all the health and safety procedures you need to do, including a clean workplace (all tiled, so easily wiped down) etc.<br>  And someone will come out to check it for you and then you will be given a certificate from them saying you're studio is registered officially under the health and safety act and hygiene.<br>  <br>  Good luck, i hope you get your place open, it's one of my dreams in life to become a tattooist :)

SQw16c5Daa	I have tried real extensionns, fake ones, the lot! Unfortunately the best are real human hair as u can style them/colour them as if they were ur own hair. And they look fatastic.

AA10729271	actually, that sounds about right for a size ten, size 6 is usually 130ish, so usually for every 10lbs you can add a size, but depending on body shape things can go up or down.  how you carry your weight can make a big difference, i know ppl 30lbs lighter than me who look about 30lbs heavier, but women in my family are curvy and tall so that makes a big difference when compared to someone who has narrow hips, basically a pear vs. an apple shape. Apples gain weight on their chests while pears tend to get it on the behind.<br>  <br>  but just to be safe get her something that is easy to fit like a cute shirt in a loose flowing style. or, better yet, get her a cute purse, that is an accessory so loosely qualifies as 'clothes'|`|e8FiZHkRaa	It depends how tall she is. If she's quite tall (we're talking about 5'8") here, then she'll probably fit that size. I can tell you now though, a lot of girls will lie about their size to fit in.

g8CqkU5haa	Ah dont listen to those long answers,its just a simple Yes you can.When your finish taking them out  just clean the area with salt and water and thats it.It will close pretty quickly,plus the sooner you take them out the less of a mark it would make.=] Goodluck|`|PeNTl6KOaa	yeah take it out, it will b fine<br>  <br>  xx|`|QvhPJAKyaa	yeah you can take them out. just be careful because they will most probably be a bit sore. and id like clean the wholes for a bit longer once you've took them out, just so they stay clean while they are growing over, and dont become infected.|`|irQMTt5maa	As long as you don't introduce any germs into the piercing when taking out the jewellery, they should heal up soon without problems and barely visible scarring - nose piercings are known for closing up very quickly. <br>  <br>  Clean your hands very thoroughly with antibacterial soap before doing it. Clean any crusted lymph off the jewellery, then clean the holes as you normally would with sterile saline solution once it's out. Try not to touch or sleep on it until at least the next day.<br>  <br>  Also, it's advisable to make sure you know how to remove the jewellery according to what type you have, to save yourself lots of fiddling and struggling that could irritate the healing wound - for example, do the balls unscrew or are they held in place by tension? It took me AGES to work out how to open the CBR when I decided to retire my cartilage piercing.<br>  <br>  If you're unsure, go back to your piercer and ask them.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|skgN9TJLaa	It's better to take them out now then the holes will heal but make sure you cleanse around the hole until properley healed.|`|18wWz5LHaa	I took my nose piercing out within 3 weeks aslong as you change it straight away it'll be fine.<br>  Your nose piercing can cover up if you dont replace it really quickly.<br>  x

2PDBxlYDaa	Yes they are. They've been trendy for a few years now.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I don't think it matters how long your hair is, it should flatter your head when you put it on and if it doesn't then don't wear it. I can't wear cowboy hats because they look bad on me, but I can wear berets, it all depends what fits your face and your head.
d2LlK0Dyaa	wash it with curl enhancing shampoo and let it dry naturally while twisting it round your fingers ! that works for me when I want curly toned down scene hair , I do it on days where I cant be bothered to make too much of an effort but it still looks effortlessly stylish !<br>  <br>  * byee muffins*<br>  <br>  ? ;] ?|`|whD25cV5aa	I have really curly hair naturally, and my hair is cut with a sweepy fringe and lots of short choppy layers. I think it's really difficult because the layers get in the way of the curls and stick out here there and everywhere, but with a little bit of mousse for curly hair (twisted sista or shockwaves etc) and some twiddling between your fingers it should look alright.<br>  <br>  Alternatively you could curl the longer parts of your hair and just leave the shorter layers natural?
emvIYyufaa	I would be able to give you a better answer if I knew your actual bra size but www.barenecessities.com is generally very good. They have bra band sizes up to 56 in most cup sizes, even up to H cup. <br>  <br>  Bravissimo is good but I believe online they only carry up to a 40 band. I'm not sure what your band size is but if it is larger, you'll likely have to go to another site like bare necessities.<br>  <br>  The larger in the band and larger in the cup you go, the harder it will be to find plunge bras. I know I have a large cup size and even though my band size is small, most of the things I find for myself is minimizers/sports bras and that kind of stuff. If you can post a bra size, I'd be able to make a better recommendation.|`|rypRuoGsaa	I believe you may find what you are looking for at barenecessities.com.

2PDBxlYDaa	Cheapest would be discount stores like Ross, TJ Maxx, Marshalls, etc..go to several ones, I suggest go to ones in nice cities, not rundown cities. These days they even have them in upper middle class cities. <br>  <br>  If you want the mall go to Forever 21, places like that.|`|yMfvPkRbaa	<a href="http://www.udresses.com/home.php?cat=4" rel="nofollow">http://www.udresses.com/home.php?cat=4</a><br>  <a href="http://www.udresses.com/home.php?cat=66" rel="nofollow">http://www.udresses.com/home.php?cat=66</a>|`|N3jQoHIPaa	Well the cheapest places you can go are the salvation army, goodwill (or other similar thrift shops) consignment shops, or Plato's Closet (they deal in gently used name brand clothing and you can look them up to see if there's a shop near you). I love thrift stores, sometimes you can get really great items for just 3 or 4 dollars. TJMaxx and other discount stores are also great places to look. It really comes down to what your personal style is and how long you are willing to devote to finding pieces. If you're into something more mainstream then you'll likely be better off at a discount clothing store or something like Plato's Closet. If you like looking a little unique and are willing to spend several days (or even weeks) putting together a wardrobe then you really can't beat thrift stores. You can find some really unique, interesting and well-fitting pieces in there if you're willing to spend some time looking and are willing to make several different trips over the course of several weeks. There are likely different stores in your area, so it's a good idea to check them all out. After a while you'll discover which ones sell "nice" items and are worth checking out over and over again. Some of them are better than others (I find the ones with more and nicer selections tend to be near major shopping centers because there is more traffic so there are more people making donations there but this might be different in your area).|`|X3QbcIUwaa	I live in the UK, so I can only give you names of UK stores. <br>  <br>  Primark<br>  Matalan<br>  Peacocks<br>  Asda<br>  Tesco<br>  <br>  Try ebay, charity shops, go to swap parties.<br>  <br>  Supermarkets have cheap clothing as well.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|PktQiQ2haa	Recommend www.raycestyle.com :-)|`|0Vgrlhm6aa	op shops. ebay|`|JQKPewwYaa	<a href="http://stores.shop.ebay.com/Affordable-Clothing-Store" rel="nofollow">http://stores.shop.ebay.com/Affordable-C...</a><br>  <br>  Try visiting the page above.<br>  Have a great one.|`|w0kQTmwhaa	Ross, Rainbow, Rave, Value City

O9KcfH0Aaa	I have red hair, and although I've never been bullied about it I used to dye it blonde when I was in my teens, I never really liked my hair colour, but I love it now. <br>  Once or twice I've had people in the street randomly shout 'Ginger' but that was very rare, and it hasn't happened in years.  What I usually get is people stopping me in the street/shops etc. to tell me how much they love my hair colour, (and green eyes, apparently that's a good combo..?) that happens often. Most of them ask if my hair is dyed too, my hair is quite a dull red, it's got darker as I get older. I work in a shop, and just yesterday I served an elderly black woman who told me that she loves my hair, and that since she was a little girl she always wanted to have red hair 'because it's beautiful and unique'. Whenever I get comments like that I feel really proud to be a redhead.<br>  In my opinion bullying someone because of their hair colour is just as bad as bullying them because of their race. I hate (I find it pathetic + a major contradiction) that someone would say that they are not prejudice, yet they will find it acceptable to make a comment about red hair. <br>  As someone already mentioned; my red hair shows off my Irish + Scottish heritage, which I'm very proud of, and I wouldn't change my unique hair colour for anything. <br>  x|`|vZDUwF0Naa	bc not many people have ginger hair, its different! what do u think is more beautiful dull hair or ginger ? the media makes it out to be people with ginger hair are ugly. and im so sick of people thinking nicola from girls aloud is ugly bc of her red hair and pale skin. get over it! all the others look the same, the same hair, the same fake tanned skin! x|`|J8SC4xARaa	Nearly every day for the past...long *** time...I get to hear "It's a ginger!!!"

I'm as red on the head as a person can get.  There are a couple of different reasons people tease us red heads.  For one thing red is the least prominent hair color.  There are fewer of us than any other.  So we are different and you know what people do when some one is different...the teasing.  That's the main reason.  But, if you want a lil history lesson I can fill you in.  Back during the days of the first rail roads Irish immigrant were considered less than dirt.  The Irish men laid rails along side the chinese and blacks for little or no wages.  It was pretty much slave labor.  Because most Irish in the US had fled here to get away from the potato plague they were poor and looked at as second class citizens.  Just to give you an idea of how bad prejudice against the Irish was, former black slaves could own land before a free born Irishman could.  Some of that prejudice is left over today.  Just like racism is passed on in other areas, hate for the Irish is still here.  Side note, Kennedy was the first president of Irish decent.  When he ran the opposition actually pointed out he was Irish and tried to make it seem like it was some kind God awful thing to be.  If you can't tell I'm of Irish decent and happy about it.  Proud of my ancestors.  So, that's the long story of teasing red heads.|`|fGs6DLoraa	i have no idea. i love ginger people. i think they look really sweet|`|i8dypBt9aa	Ginger hair's cute ...... i like it :D|`|ztMeGHY0aa	Some people just enjoy trying to take others down lower than they feel they are themselves.

As others have stated, you have an hour glass figure.|`|rQmBuXnaaa	average|`|edAtsw3waa	It's hard to tell...I would say you're nearly an hourglass, a good way to tell is to measure you hips, waist and bust.

AA10729271	Ironically, it's probably the fact that you have such strong healthy hair that is the problem, some hair is just like this (my best friend is a hair dresser so I have heard about this problem), your hair is ironclad my dear, and will always take a lot of product.

Do some of your own research on it and see how it can benefit you.|`|HfoOzY1Vaa	Maybe its because you use the facial scrub every day, try cutting it down to 3 times a week, maybe even less, it's keeping your pores open as they are, which isn't great for the skin.<br>  <br>  Goodluck

kXTYqfXcaa	Pasty foundation to make you look pale and take out all the color from your face. This is the most important step. Then use a pale lip gloss/stick on your lips to add to the "sickly" effect. After that, take grey or black eyeliner and smudge it very subtly on the rim of your eyes, but make sure it looks natural and not at all like real makeup. You should look like there are dark shadows under your eyes, which will go well with the pale skin. <br>  After that, wear your hair loose, or loosely pulled back, and mess it up so it hangs over your face and looks all dishevelled. <br>  <br>  As for acting tips, the easiest way to appear sick is to choose a foolproof illness like a headache/migrane and feeling faint. Use a quiet, faint voice, keep a hand over your eyes or pressed to your forehead and stumble around. This gives off the whole "damsel in distress" thing and it's more likely he'll be concerned and try to steady you :) You can dampen your forehead with with a warm flannel to make you seem clammy or feverish.|`|zPUgLT7Aaa	Pale Pale Pale ?<br>  Talcum powder colour ,, or a light very faint powder ,<br>  Don't make it look to obvious <br>  Blend blend blend :)<br>  erm watering eyes ,, <br>  if you stare at something for ages without blinking they can water <br>  cough ??<br>  But not like some people when they are pretending to be ill every second they are like cough cough cough cough cough splutter cough <br>  Just every soo often<br>  croaky ish voice maybe ?<br>  make ur face expressions dull because when ur ill ii don't know many people who are like big smiles on their face eyes gleaming laughing etc..<br>  so yhh don't be like dull dull dull ! cos thats really boring ii mean if someone says something funny still laugh and smile but then cough half way through<br>  <br>  ohh i dunno to be honest lool<br>  anyway ii hope i helped :) x<br>  ohh and don't make it look fake ,, like too obvious lol|`|i3ybnD9raa	make your face look really pale by putting on pale foundation or put white eyeshadow over your face but use it like powder fondation<br>  it works  i did it to school before and everyone was telling me how ill i looked :) x|`|1mLEs9CHaa	love u linds x besties for life|`|jRFcSfLUaa	LOL, my friends did this to me on friday :) I wanted to get out of last period and go home, so they did my makeup to make me look ill :)<br>  <br>  Ok, first they smeared whatever eye makeup I had on, downwards.

The hair comes off as you rinse.<br>  I never had any red bumps.  You should test on a small part of your leg to make sure you won't have a reaction.  If you do, do not use it.<br>  One precaution you should take is to NOT use it in "intimate" parts of your body.  It burns like hell.  Don't ask me how I know this.  Also, it smells pretty bad and the smell kind'a made my eyes water; no worse than some hair products, though.<br>  The box should tell you how long to leave it on - initially I think it's three minutes and no longer than ten.|`|3FUrqYTTaa	a) well it can vary from person to person.

I mean, you can go shopping absolutely anywhere as long as you know what you're looking for. Of course shops such as TopShop are normally very good at holding the latest styles. As for identifying the styles, if you flick through certain magazines such as Vogue or look at the catwalks you can see certain trends. For instance, at the moment preppy blazers and layered skirts are in but then again it really is dependant upon your own style.
d5065693519b5b048f87de49a76bf961aa	*I've researched/experimented for many years and this safe, natural treatment has given quick, remarkable results. It doesn't just fade lines and wrinkles but greatly minimizes them and largely prevent others forming. Use any oil - I've had great success with olive oil diluted 50/50 with grape seed oil. Buy both in big supermarkets. The lines going from nose to corners  of mouth are treated by massaging firmly and quite fast directly on and along the lines. For vertical frown lines between brows  put hands together as you would for prayer with two index fingers pressing on the lines.  Massage lines by alternately moving hands up and down. It's best to do firmly and quite vigorously. Do both for 10 min several times a day for quickest results. See clearly noticeable results in just a week or two, depending on how vigorously/how often you have massaged.  Crows feet  are the easiest to treat.and will diminish in a matter of days. You massage very fast up and down on lines using front of first three fingers held close together.  IMPORTANT: You have to first tighten facial skin. To do that  partially open mouth about 1", pull lips firmly back against teeth and protrude the chin forward.slightly. Virtually tightens all of face skin. <br>  NECK: Two treatments help. Place right hand on neck then do long back and forward sweeps starting from just to left of chin point to back of neck. Do fast and many times. Then do the left side using left hand. Another excellent treatment is yoga face and neck poses, Find on YouTube. Do the " Lion pose" and hold for 30 secs. Then do another similar pose with the tongue protruded as if trying to touch tip of nose with tip of tongue. Try to hold for 30 seconds. <br>  I have testimonials from happy users*B.<br>  <br>  SOURCE(S): 20+ years research - safe, natural treatments for skin enhancement and cures of skin problems and anti aging/rejuvenation treatments.|`|AA10729271	well, if you start at 14 apply certain types of oils can prolong the youthfulness of your skin, but if you already have crows feet then you're going to need to go a little higher tech.|`|8jY4JUw7aa	oil of olay
PyeyaDScaa	of course you can!!! You just need to make precautions!! lways put petroleum jelly (vaseline)around your whole eyebrow before ! Always do it for slightly less on thepackaging because you don't want them to come out too dark! Its unlikely it will go into your eye, cos the dye is also quite thick. When dying never brush over your skin, just onto your hairs! It will tell you in the  eyebrow dye indtructions i'm sure what to do for it not to go wrong! Don't worry its not that hard..if your follow the instructions carefully it won't go wrong!!!I advise you to go to a beauty salon, and get someone to do it there! It last about three weeks, so if you don't like it its not like you are stuck with it forever! If you like it then you can try yourself! The best thing about someone doing it is that you can request how may shades darker, or if you want more of a black/brown tint. I love having mine done cos even though my eyebrows are brown, it accentuates them much more and gets rid of those little fair bits! They always say your eyebrows shape your face! Have fun!|`|3IXDx9nhaa	If you have very fair hair then this is a good idea and very effective, you can also get your eyelashes done and won't need to wear mascara.  I would only recommend this be done by a professional though.  If you use the wrong product or leave it on too long you could have bad results and you don't want to take chances on your face! Lots of hairdressers have beauty people or go to a beauty salon, it dosn't cost that much.  They might even be willing to give you some tips but get it done professionally at first.|`|DV8AIpjFaa	of course you can. Its not a bad idea. Many women do it. Don't do it yourself until you know how to. Get someone who knows how to do it themeselves. Never done it myself but my friend dyes her eyebrows the same shade as her a hair, so as she's dying her hair, she'll put a bit on the brows. Looks nice. Obviously its a bad idea if you dont know how to do it and you get it in your eye. lol. get someone to do it for you.|`|tWFc9mTGaa	You can but go 2 a salon.. we use Special eye brow dye rather than hair dye but u cant make the hair lighter only darker. hope this helps...

AA10729271	dandruff shampoos are a ripoff, and depending on the cause of the dandruff they can actually aggravate the problem. In general most shampoos are very harsh and can dry out you scalp, you're long hair doesn't have so much to do with your problem as your hair washing routine. that fact that you are losing hair only supports this. I will give you some advice.<br>  <br>  1. go to a salon and buy yourself some decent shampoo and conditioner, something high in protein (yes your hair needs protein) if you don't use conditioner then it's time you started since it is a requirement of longer hair.<br>  <br>  2. When you wash your hair with shampoo gently massage your scalp with your finger tips, no nails, just the tips, this exfoliates your scalp.<br>  <br>  3. When rinsing out shampoo/conditioner, once you think all the soap is washed out, count to 30 and let the hair rinse out 30 seconds longer than you think you need. Lots of dandruff is caused by skin that is irritated by residual shampoo products <br>  <br>  4. once a week try an olive oil treatment.

This bacteria infect clogged pores with toxins. These toxins are the fluid inside the zits.<br>  <br>  To protect against these toxins, nearby skin cells form a capsule around them and the infected area. In other words they isolate the toxins via the capsules. <br>  <br>  I guess you can say that zits are capsules filled with toxins..<br>  <br>  But what happens when we pop zits (break the capsules)?<br>  <br>  Well the toxins are once again released. They continue to damage nearby skin cells. Thus making the contaminated area larger and deeper.<br>  <br>  And that's bad news because......<br>  <br>  ......Deep scars will develop. And I'm sure you know that the deeper the scars the longer they remain on our faces.<br>  <br>  So instead of popping zits here's a better method.......<br>  <br>  ......Exfoliate. <br>  <br>  Exfoliation simply means removing the top layer of skin (the epidermis). So think about it. <br>  <br>  If you remove the epidermis, you'll "un-roof" the zit. In other words you'll take off the head of the pimple.<br>  <br>  Then the toxins can come out without infecting the healthy nearby cells. <br>  <br>  So try exfoliating at least twice a week by using Glycolic Pads, Microdermabrasion Creams and chemical peels (i.e. if you can afford chemical peels).<br>  <br>  Or if you're a little low on cash, you can make your own exfoliants.|`|8jY4JUw7aa	clean & clear face wash|`|4fnu8XeWaa	u should buy a peeling!!|`|ozarsEFpaa	Ugh.

LcAiHBsaaa	First off, OPINION does not = IGNORANCE.  Get that right.<br>  <br>  When you ask a question in an open forum, ESPECIALLY a question that is based solely on opinion, (i.e. I am 13, should I get a tattoo?  What do you guys think of this tattoo?) what do you expect?  Some tattoos are lame and will look like crap and I can guarantee that person will regret it in about 10 years... hell yes I am going to give my opinion LIKE THEY ASKED.  As far as religion, I don't agree with some of the religious people saying that people shouldn't get tattoos (and I don't know why they are lurking in a tattoo forum of all places to spread their word, go to politics, they need it more!) but again, it's OPINION and they can say what they want.<br>  <br>  Oh man, do I love having the freedom to express how I feel, whether it be choosing my country's leader or giving my opinion on a "stupid" tattoo.<br>  <br>  If people wanted a sugar coated answer on how "cool" their latest tattoo idea was, they should go to their friends and family, not an open forum filled with tons of highly opinionated people.<br>  <br>  Also, in regards to someone saying they just wanted tips and helpful information, GOOGLE IT.  Why is that so hard to do?  Instead, your lazy ***'s come in here and want everyone else to do the work for you.  C'mon now...|`|dO0vTP7Gaa	If your thinking of getting a tattoo don't want to know why, scientist just found diseases in the paint that they use for tattoos also they have to needle the tattoo in your skin and who ever gets a tattoo is an idiot.<br>  <br>  <br>                                            ~Emma :-D|`|97b7d9795e7ae2ee4648b9cbb2fe32a4aa	i agree. its super frustrating. i have a tattoo. its cute and little. maybe someday ill get another one. maybe i wont. some person on yahoo answers that ive never met wont make that decision for me. <br>  <br>  its aggravating, bc like you said, you just want tips and helpful information.  i understand when the question is 'the man i love is married' then your a homewrecker & deserve rude answers. but something like tattoos and peircing. thats completely an opinion. people shouldnt be so rude about things that are up to that individual.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  to each his own =]|`|JduQHocdaa	I agree,but there are people that deserve some harsh answers to give them a reality check.

There is also legitimate concerns about infection, etc.<br>     Just because someone's opinion isn't the same as yours doesn't mean they are bigoted, rude , or not understanding.<br>      I have heard many compelling arguments for not getting tattooed, and quite frankly would think long and hard before getting one myself.<br>      The major problem I have with tattoos is that they are permanent, but not. A tattoo that looked great 20 years ago can be an eyesore today after years of fading and wrinkling have turned it into an unrecognizable blob.<br>      What about the kid who goes out and gets his girlfriend's name tattooed across his chest? It's fine for now, but in ten years when the girlfriend is long gone and is nothing more than a distant memory, of what use is the tattoo? In instances like that people live with their regrets or undergo expensive and very painful removal.<br>   ****NOTE**** As someone who is "not of age", there's a reason why you are not allowed to make certain descisions. You seem to think that you know it all, and insulting people that are trying to make you see another side of the coin demonstrates your immaturity.|`|ZkrGttKaaa	I think some folks, while safely hiding under the anonymity of the net, will say things that they would never say, if they were talking face to face with those people. And they're probably not all in the same category. Some people are thoughtless, and speak too soon, some are hostile, and some are apathetic toward others feelings. Some people... and I think this is the primary reason, have had a bad experience with someone with a tattoo, possibly at a young age. Anyway, I'm not much of a critic of these people. Giving them the right to their feelings gives me the right to have mine. And wouldn't the world be a boring place, if everyone agreed on everything? (hehehe!) Helluva deal!

edAtsw3waa	Please do not go to a hairdresser to get your back and chest waxed, now i'm not saying they all do it but most of them double dip the spatula which risks the chance of their clients catching a serious infection. Go to a qualified beauty therapist and be sure they don't double dip the spatula if it goes over the waxed skin twice. You never need parents permission for waxing. Waxing is a great thing to do that allows hair to grow back softer and sparser :-)|`|JavIo0Asaa	No you can go get waxed at any age, you dont need your parents permission|`|cjS1g70xaa	If I were you i would really reconsider because once you start shaving or waxing a part of your body it's a long time commitment.. are the hairs really THAT bad?

v0kOwUikaa	I've worn them several times, and in fact, I still do on occasion. I prefer the full tight or pantyhose style, but when I am going out somewhere sexy and dancing, I like to wear them because when I twist around on the dance floor, my dress or skirt may rise a little and show off the garter style on the hose. To me they are much better then stockings because you don't have the clips from the garter digging into your legs, and if you wear the hold-up style stockings, they tend to fall down the thigh sometimes.|`|CRDl9nffaa	I still have a pair somewhere and I think they're kind of alright. But I haven't worn them for years, which probably shows that I'm not that bothered.<br>  <br>  They're OK. I wouldn't prefer them over stockings, though, except for when you don't want your suspenders visible under tighter clothes.<br>  <br>  They can make you feel more streamlined and funky than stockings, but be ready for the fact that at first it feels like wearing tights with giant holes in them!
bdc81a350221a05348d3b5708b5daa86aa	I am mid brown and tried it and hair was bright orange. If you want it done get it done by a professional, if doing it yourself you will need the blond bleach and then a toner, my mother has been bleaching her hair for 40 odd years and she always goes for Clairol hair lightener ￡5+ and clairol Born Blond Toner ￡4+|`|qyT15nmXaa	It might not go ginger.. but it will certainly go an odd colour. It's impossible to use blonde hairdye on black hair and it turning out okay. Stripping your hair, or bleach is the only option. If you don't want to do either of those, then I suggest you use blonde hairdye on the part you want blonde, and every six weeks dye it over again and again. In the process you'll have some weird hair colours but after a few dyes you'll be the colour you want. x|`|VdjmrwMZaa	ya it will def go ginger<br>  youll have to go to the hairdressers<br>  <br>  if youre planning to do it at home you are going to have to bleach it TWICE<br>  <br>  not on the same day tho<br>  do it on a weekend and leave your hair relax after one bleaching<br>  <br>  i have dyed black hair aswell and i wanted blonde on top <br>  (my natural hair is blonde)<br>  but the hair dresser said my hair will break off if i bleach it<br>  <br>  but if you just want blonde on the bottom you should get extensions<br>  thats what i did and you can get like blonde coon tails for like a fiver in claires and new look<br>  <br>  hope ive helped|`|lzWa6Cyxaa	hey:)i live in UK too.yeh it will go ginger...i did exactlyyy the same thing and im naturally a brunette.dyed my hair black then tried going light and it didnt work out...had ginger hair that no matter  how much u dyed it still showed through...this because naturally dark hair has undertones of orange and red that f u try to lighten turn them ornage...the home box lightening kits availabe from stores arnt strong enough to lighten dark hair..i bleached mine 10 times to get it a blonde shade(kindof) and by then my hairr was sooooo damaged and broken it snapped off.i think the best thing is to go to hair salon ...their bleach should be strong enough and they add a toner afterwards to get rid of any orange/yelloe or red that is left due to lightening..and ur hair will be saved from extreme chemical damage:) pleaaassseeee dnt do it urself:) im still dealing with my damaged hair even tho its been a year now.|`|Ta2lNKUVaa	A friend of mine tried something similar, and it went bright orange even when it was wet...be careful. Perhaps you should go to a professional.|`|8jY4JUw7aa	yessssss|`|KospnUgyaa	it depends how long ago it was that you last dyed you hair black, <br>  i had the same problem but with my fringe, <br>  it looks totally awesome now, but i did have problems :P<br>  <br>  i would definitly suggest going to a hairdressers and getting it done properly.<br>  <br>  i went to a hair dressers and although i had dyed my hair for about 9 weeks, it still went orangy.<br>  <br>  it took them 3 attemps and another two weeks later with a toner aswell.<br>  <br>  first it went a red colour, red/orange, and then an orange/yellow<br>  they had to stop after that because it really dried my hair out<br>  but two weeks later i went back and they bleached it again, it went a <br>  white blonde colour and they used a toner too.<br>  now it looks great :]<br>  <br>  i dont think its possible to prevent it happening appart from not doing it.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  just go to a professional hairdressers and persevere<br>  you'll get there !|`|jRFcSfLUaa	It's quite funny that you asked this :)<br>  My best friend is a natural mousey colour, and she dyes her hair different colours all the time. She died it black about a month ago, and has been dying it lighter for a few weeks (using dark shades of brown).<br>  <br>  She was going to be clever, and dye her hair a stage lighter every time, so that when she DID go blonde, it would turn out right. Then, overnight, she went on impulse and dyed her hair bleach blonde.<br>  <br>  Hello, ginger. LOL. Her hair was ORANGE. She dealt with stick for about a week, from everybody. Only recently has she managed to lighten the orange. <br>  I think you should do the smart thing that she never got round to doing, and just keep going a shade lighter each time on the bottom of your hair. It will take a few months maybe to get it just right before you go blonde, but trust me, you WILL go ginger. BRIGHT ginger.<br>  <br>  Take care.|`|IZWqZC46aa	Yes there is a possiblity that you will.<br>  But to prevent it try and get a really thick blound couler so it goes over the black because i know black is very thick .|`|DGCIrUBcaa	If you have it done at a  salon, they will use a solution that will strip your natural color, then they will dye it blonde. It will turn out perfect<br>  but it is pretty costly.|`|i8dypBt9aa	my friend has got black hair, she used bleach and her hair came out proper blonde although she coloured it red again and the colour wasn't so nice|`|H5BZGM1Paa	dont know how to prevent it but i can say that my friend did that....and the result was not pretty :-/....its very definitely ginger now lol xx

AA10729271	rinse your hair with lemon juice after washing (cheap bottled stuff works fine), then rinse out, that'll get anything from hair dye to bad self tan off. though what it'll do to the remaining red color who knows.
jW1fCss9aa	See, most people will tell you that blue works great, or black, or even green, but really?<br>   <br>  Try purple. Gel liners and Liquids can come in purple, and purple really draws attention and makes them pop.<br>  <br>  With a purple liner, you want to keep eyeshadow minimum, but a lighter purple with a darker liner looks best, rimming your eye all the way around.<br>  <br>  I'm also very pale, brown eyes, and blonde, and I use purple almost every day, and it works like a dream.

Just don't use it every day.  You shouldn't wash and style your hair every day, anyhow.  I do it every other and my hair is fine.  I just bought a cheap Revlon straightener ($20 at Walmart) and it works fine.  It's ceramic.  As far as shampoos and conditioners, try pantene smooth and sleek.  And if you can ever deep condition or do an oil treatment on your hair, do it.  The winter months are rough enough on your hair without adding s curling iron, straightener, blow-dryer......You can usually buy an oil treatment for relatively cheap in any drug store or even grocery store, and I use Aussie's 3 minute deep treatment for my hair about once a week.

Supermarket brands such as Pantene, Dove and Tresemme actually do no good for your hair. <br>  Redken is a salon brand, but can be a bit pricey. Al'chemy is an organic brand, using only natural ingredients, so you know you're not going to get any of those bad chemical stuff in your hair. Loreal Professional is good for colour treated hair. <br>  <br>  And lastly, despite what everyone thinks, more conditioner does NOT fix frizzy hair. If you wash your hair everyday, try not to since this 'stresses' your hair and strips it of all its natural oils.

PR42HDjraa	There are straightening sprays and smoothing sprays that will keep your hair straight longer after using a straightener. They're at your local drug store or at any beauty store like Sally Beauty|`|KglISfFIaa	my hair was the same way<br>  i thinned it out and it helped A LOT<br>  :]

dt2Vl76Gaa	This can be easy to attain if your hair is naturally wavy/curly, but for straight hair it can be a little harder. To achieve her hairstyle, this is my suggestion:<br>  Start with damp hair. Work in an anti-frizz serum, and then let it dry for a couple of minutes to let that product work in. Then, while hair is still damp, apply a curling gel or mousse (a generous amount for your hair length and scrunch it, adding more as needed.) Allow your hair to dry a bit more, and then spray with hairspray before it is 100% dry. You can also speed up the drying process with a blow dryer with a diffuser attached to it. <br>  Then once your bangs are dry, straighten just them.<br>  I do my hair in a similar style to that all of the time. It's a lot easier than straightening.|`|7e80152bdb8d8318404698c1b63f95c1aa	scrunch it with mousse when its damp|`|PgFGRVOyaa	you should scrunch it that makes it look wet. all you do is get gel and get a piece of hair in your hand then put it in yer hair .its so easy to do but it s hard to explain sorry.But scrunching yer hair is pretty and it looks like the hairstyle you want in the picture|`|tjZUbRDeaa	Scrunch it! Use Redkin Curl Boost. Use a diffuser and blow dry your hair while scrunching. Good luck!|`|z71fx9J4aa	use hair curlers the soft bendy ones after applying mousse|`|SDxm8jtnaa	apply oil. don't comb it

I also love these:<br>  <a href="http://www.flexi8.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flexi8.com/</a><br>  - Side parted hair with the front section clipped to the side. I like to use little jaw clips, but bobby pins will work if your hair isn't too thick.<br>  - Flipped through pony tail. Put your hair in a loose pony tail. Reach up under the pony tail and separate the hair there into two sections. Use your other hand to twist the tail and then pull it through from the bottom. <br>  - French ponytail. Put the top section of your hair (above ears) into a ponytail. Next, put the middle into a pony. Then put the bottom into a pony. This looks less kiddy if you do it looser with pretty clips.<br>  - Braids and buns are simple and can disguise bad hair days. If your hair is too short for a single braid, try pigtails. <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Braid-Hair" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Braid-Hair</a><br>  -French braid headband.

Maybe get bangs.
HWv9Zovxaa	Hmm. Well, you can straiten it, pull back the front part and tease it a little bit. Not too big! You can leave it strait when it's teased, or give it some big bouncy curls. Good luck!|`|J8SC4xARaa	My hair's really long too, and one of my favorite things to do is put a braid on the top layer of my hair on each side, then pull them under the rest of my hair and tie them together underneath the back. I hope I explained that well! Headbands are also amazing and they're a really simple way to change your look. And you can even just try parting your hair slightly off center.It will help you look different and give you a little more volume at the roots. One last thing you could do is put your hair in a low side ponytail. It looks really cute and stays in long hair better then a regular ponytail. Oh, and I have wavy hair and NEVER straighten it, so even if you just stop straightening it that will give a new look. If your hair's wavy too and you want to bring out the wave a little more, I suggested the Curl Goddess Curling Mist from Avon's mark. line.|`|p0fqV7BDaa	You could wear it in a cute pony tail, with maybe a flower, some teasing on the crown area, off to the side, maybe wrap a little hair around where the rubber band goes--just make it creative! You could go with braids, or maybe scrunch your hair to give it some wave with a little gel. For a different kind of beachy wave, you could wrap your hair around a large curling iron for those loose, free waves. Good luck!|`|JiF6pOYeaa	hw about makein urself a bang and i hump at the top and pull it back into a ponytail and curl the hair thts in the  tailpony or colorin ur hair|`|XN0cYCATaa	OK, I hope you are ready for this cause I have a Lot, I am Partial to the “Bob” Style, so I will Start with that, But not limited to that.

AA11461724	i don't know where you heard that from but it's not true. your natural haircolor will not change, it will always grow back your natural color and you will always be able to see your roots. if you do dye your hair dark brown but decide to change it down the road, they do make a color remover called color oops, they sell it at walgreens and rite aid, it's $10.00. you could use that and it will take out all the dark dye. but if you don't want to do that and you decide you want to try it before you commit, try clairol natural instincts. their colors are semi permanent, level 2 hair dye that wash out after so many washes. this is their site: <a href="http://clairol.com/naturalinstincts/shade_chart_brown.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://clairol.com/naturalinstincts/shad...</a><br>  try that, and if you decide you don't like it, it will all wash out! but if you decide you do like it, let it all wash out and then get a box of permanent, level 3 dye. good luck!|`|evG6zBBKaa	Use the cheap dye first, you won't regret it.

Trust me, skin cancer is one of the deadliest; so, you want to check for that and catch it before it goes too far (if it is, indeed, malignant).<br>  <br>  Uusally, as I have many, many moles . . . they are benign. You may just have a genetic predisposition to them (as I do). <br>  <br>  The needle, if needed, doesn't hurt that bad. And even if it does, a bit, it is far less painful, I am sure, then chemotherapy and deep biopsies or cancer! Close your eyes and think happy thoughts! It takes like a second or two to have them removed . . .|`|xYW7PdXwaa	That is no need to remove ur moles.. Moles are actually created 2 give someone a good expression.

zzp1o9mlaa	At the early stages of hair loss, dandruff begins to increase. However, an increase in the amount of dandruff does not necessarily mean that there is a "cause-effect" relationship resulting in the thinning of hair.<br>  <br>  You should think of excessive dandruff as a warning sign as far as the health of the hair is concerned.<br>  <br>  Dandruff is made up of bits of dead skin that peel away from the scalp as a result of the effects of metabolism. Normally, dandruff, in its early stages of growth, is not visible to the naked eye. It becomes visible only after enlarging into pieces of dead skin (what we normally call "dandruff") as a result of the propagation of bacteria and/or problems with seborrhea scalp conditions.|`|aAYoGadpaa	as for to make ur hair not greasy dont use conditioner atleast that makes my hair not greasy hope this helps :]|`|kb9k1jn1aa	dandruff itself does not create hair loss. However if you have dry skin (which can produce dandruff) it can weaken the hair follicles and therefore experience hair loss. nothing too serious though!<br>  :)

I haven't been frustrated with my hair since.|`|VHi7Kaokaa	tease it, i wish i had thick hair so i could tease mine.|`|wkuCydzRaa	Get loads and loads of layers in to thin it right out, then strighten it into a side fringe, then hairspray it all over and give a messy look.<br>  <br>  It will look lush|`|Zx23ZXgGaa	if you want your hair to be less thick, ask your hair dresser or to thin your hair, or razor it. it works really well.|`|cc7a9e602a34331d1b8fc3083e410395aa	ask your hairdresser to thin your hair down using thinning scissors! it should be easier to style then!
tlGpXXp6aa	Your hair may be growing too fast, then you should probably cut it, once in a while. Or maybe you should stop eating the healthy foods that you eat (eating habit drinking water) You should put petroleum jelly in your hair to make it grow slower, because it will clog your scalp's pores, and stop fast growing of your hair. I hope this helped!! ;]|`|S15ffaE8aa	Honestly.. There is nothing.. try a shorter cut than usual.. and it won't grow out as quickly.. You probably have a looser scalp..

hxvKkvP8aa	you cant, and if you attempt to it will only make weird looking creases in your hair....|`|9nqVABVtaa	you need to put all your hair up except a layer at th bottom. remember one layer can have many sub layers if you have lots of strands or thick hair so you may have to start with a sub layer. you start with the layer or sub layer right at your neck. then you take an inch to three inches across and take your straightner and start at the root. move it clockwise  and you should get a curl. e mail me if you still dont understand|`|k8INpStRaa	hmm,it depends tho.Because if you have a skinny straightner then it could POSSIBLY work,but if you have a straightner more than 1 1/2 then its just gonna leave those creases in your hair..OHH..and also make sure that the straightener has heat on the outside of it too..p.you should really try and use a curling iron when you get the chance to get ahold of one;]<br>  <br>  hopefully i helped out=)|`|WwQ1y5TMaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6nwbJW6eHk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6nwbJW6e...</a><br>  Basically you rotate the straightener on an angle and pull very slowly.<br>  *Your straightener must have ROUND barrels!

e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	- Half up with a clip or hair tie. I also like putting half up in a bun with bobby pins. (They tend to not get caught on my hair.) I also love these:<br>  <a href="http://www.flexi8.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flexi8.com/</a><br>  - Side parted hair with the front section clipped to the side. I like to use little jaw clips, but bobby pins will work if your hair isn't too thick.<br>  - Flipped through pony tail. Put your hair in a loose pony tail. Reach up under the pony tail and separate the hair there into two sections. Use your other hand to twist the tail and then pull it through from the bottom. <br>  - French ponytail. Put the top section of your hair (above ears) into a ponytail. Next, put the middle into a pony. Then put the bottom into a pony. This looks less kiddy if you do it looser with pretty clips.<br>  - Braids and buns are simple and can disguise bad hair days. If your hair is too short for a single braid, try pigtails. <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Braid-Hair" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Braid-Hair</a><br>  -French braid headband.

e3dad9cc3f217fc64b3369e29a929c0caa	You're unlikely to get a desirable result without visiting a salon with a color expert.  I recommend going to a salon that uses Redken hair color products.  Lightening your hair from black will cause some damage no matter what.  Maybe you should get your hair heavily highlighted with brown & light brown all over, and that would create a really beautiful multi-dimensional effect.  Grow out the black and keep trimming it off, all the while keep going back for more highlights.<br>  <br>  I dyed my hair from brown to black 10 years ago and wish I had gone through this process to get it corrected, rather than chopping it all off (19 inches, but at least it went to Locks of Love).<br>  <br>  Seriously, don't try to correct your hair at home, not when it's black.  Let the experts do it.  You won't regret it.  If cost is an issue, find a good hair school where they teach the Redken haircoloring techniques.  My last color job took over 4 hours but only cost me $45 plus tip, even though I had over 100 foils in my hair and 4 colors of highlights, because I had it done at a beauty school.  They did a FANTASTIC job!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|R7DnAPMAaa	To be honest i would wait for it to come through the roots :)<br>  <br>  <br>  ANYONE HELPP ( ITS TO DO WITH SCENE HAIR :D )<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090307200551AApKija">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|7QN9wetGaa	ummm wow thts goin to take some time<br>  cuz is black hair. your the same like me<br>  i have it black now i wanted to go brown<br>  nd i bleached it bt it didnt even look brown haha<br>  it was still sorta dark. so yea idk<br>  let it grow out
zmJKzdZTaa	I've heard various things...<br>  First of all, lemon juice won't just automatically turn your hair blonde, unless it's already blonde and you're trying to go for a lighter shade. =]<br>  Putting lemon juice and water together in the spray bottle and spraying it like you did sounds good.<br>  As for the time, however, it varies.<br>  Just have a mirror handy and look at the process as it goes. <br>  I'm also guessing that it might take more than one day to get your end result. <br>  But like I said, if your hair isn't really blonde or a light brown already, you might want to get it dyed.|`|fkpaxydPaa	Well putting lemons in your hair doesn't "turn" it blonde. it just brings out the natural highlights in your hair. if say you have brown hair, it might make it a few shades lighter but don't expect wonders. and it will take over a day that's for sure|`|hWaH6iDMaa	It brings out the natural blonde highlights in your hair.<br>  <br>  if you have brunette hair it probably won't work.... unless you have blonde highlights naturally....<br>  <br>  I do it, but I have nauturally blonde highlights in my hair.<br>  <br>  hope I helped<br>  <br>   :D|`|ok8vxwuxaa	it really like depends what color your hair is, but if its dark then forget about it <br>  add some water to the spray bottle but you like really need to get it all over your hair<br>  also your hair won't get any lighter in one day, you would have to keep doing everyday for like a month so i really don't think its worth it|`|xfAk2KaUaa	It will take a couple of tries, also lemon juice only lightens, it doesn't bleach your hair. So if your hair is brown for example, it will not turn your hair blonde, it will only give a few dark blonde highlights.<br>  You will need to sit out in the sun for at least an hour to see any colour change|`|R7DnAPMAaa	you can't do that just dye it xD<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  your funny xD<br>  <br>  HELP ME PLEASEE<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090307200551AApKija&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>

I pierced my ears when I was a kid, and used a safety pin stretched out and heated over a flame so it would be "sanitized". I never did anything to "care for them", I just put in studs and turned them a couple of times. I also had a friends pierce my tongue when I was in my twenties and the only thing I did to care for that was rinse with Listerine a few times each day, but mouths are full of bacteria, and I knew it could get infected easy.|`|bbrj7lD5aa	read this sentence:<br>  "i've had them pierced plenty of times!! && she knows th@ i wont take care of them"|`|b0567ce2ec94aad1068db86dfdd2c890aa	how old are you? if uve had them pierced multiple times and u couldn't take care them.... she has a point|`|3ece80164c2739cc39f908768c919b69aa	The fact that you have already had them pierced multiple times and have not been able to take care of them, says a lot about you and the level of responsibility that you are able to take on. <br>  <br>  First and foremost, you have to respect your mother's opinion, since you are living under her roof (assuming that you are living under her roof). When was the last time that you had your ears pierced? If it was more than a year ago, you may be able to explain to your mother that you are a year older, that a lot has changed in your life, and so on and so forth. Ultimately though, you are living under her roof and she has the final say. <br>  <br>  Try explaining to your mother about the care that you know needs to go into having your ears pierced, and what you are willing to do to make the piercing a success this time around. Come up with the money to pay for the piercing, the cleaning solution, and the earrings yourself. Just earning the money on your own will show your mother that you are attempting to be responsible, and that you are taking responsibility for the piercing of your ears. <br>  <br>  Also, consider your age. Many parents think that their children are not responsible enough until they are 12 or 14 years old to take care of pierced ears. Most parents do not want to take care of pierced ears for a child, so they want their child to wait to get their ears pierced. As someone who convinced her own parents to have her ears pierced at a young age, and then was too careless to take care of them, I can see why your mother wants to make you wait until you are older. <br>  <br>  Show your mother how responsible you are by caring for younger siblings when she needs a night to herself, keeping your room clean, doing well in school, and doing your chores without being asked. You might be able to convince your mother that you are responsible now more than you were the last time that you had your ears pierced. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|GykCnbR7aa	just tell her ur older know and u r more responsible now|`|bEVhDE9Raa	why dont you show her your responsible in other areas like cleaning your room, looking after a sibling or pet or something<br>  and then after a while, if she doesnt notice, point it out to her:)|`|rJGUv8eOaa	u could try doing this so she thinks and feels like ur responsible 2 get your ears pierces and take care of them.<br>  <br>  i don't think you'd like 2 hav ur ear cut off or something cause u don't take care of it..|`|beP3BOzfaa	She's probably seen how you type.<br>  <br>  Feel lucky she puts food in your mouth.|`|vdJimPfqaa	well we dont know your mom.

U7Frz0nRaa	i would recommend visible changes, only because u have ur choice of level expertise.u can choose one of three: student, intermediate, or expert.the thing is that they have their portfolio at hand.so you'll be surprised at who actually has the talent regardless of experience.the prices ranges from levels.since you have the virgin hair i wouldn't risk it...make sure you browse through plenty of portfolios.good luck and have fun with it, remember hair grows back<br>  !|`|JoXWxRq6aa	Breez is the best its $50 but worth it!!|`|U1HxFmtHaa	a hair salong|`|xfpJGBfwaa	First, find a picture of what you want it to look like.  <br>  <br>  Next take the picture with you and just ask for a consultation.  Ask the haridresser whether he or she thinks it will look good on you.  Just talk.  <br>  <br>  Visit several places.  Look for signs of dirtyness which could indicate you can catch fungal diseases of the scalp there.  Avoid those places, because you will end up walking out of there covered in other people's hair bits. Yuck! <br>  <br>  Just interview enough places and eventually you will find the right one.  Or at least two places you like somewhat.  <br>  <br>  It's my personal opinion that older hairdressers are better for me.  I don't let anyone who looks to be in their 20's touch my hair.  I think young hairdressers are arrogant.
kwYbe4n6aa	Diesel|`|IUxM3brbaa	tight ones|`|2mdlmmJeaa	i can tell you one thing. don't buy them from aeropostale, hollister, abercrombie, etc.<br>  those are really expensive and bad quality. <br>  my jeans come from places like walmart and target and their way better quality and less expensive than those from the stores listed above.|`|8qSx7CKOaa	the ones not everyone else is buying.

But since I was sharing it with my sister, it went away fast and I never used it again.  Then I started using it again a couple months ago, and it did not work at all. If anything, it made my acne worse.<br>  Now I use St.Ives Swiss Forumla Scrub. It cost around 5 dollars at CVS or RiteAid, and it works really good for me. I don't break out any more.|`|Xlod4pSkaa	It is really bad for your skin because it has bleach and alto of other chemicals in it once you run out you will be breaking out heaps.. (P.S it makes you age quicker)|`|WfexBha2aa	gross, no.<br>  <br>  my skin's not that sensitive, but it dried my face out like a sponge.<br>  <br>  for me it was just another cheap, crappy "acne solution".|`|spXPpyP0aa	no|`|5kqZWBbuaa	My face was so embarressing! I hated going out and I just felt so self concious and not pretty at all! I was upset all the time and it had everything to do with my face.<br>  Then me and my mum saw this ad for proactive, and I thought hey i've tried every other face cream there is this HAS to work. <br>  When it finally arrived and I started using it my face flared up worse then it had before. I think I went from pissed off to depressed in 2.5 seconds. But mum told me to keep at it and in a month my face was clear and smooth.<br>  I couldn't believe it! I was so happy and for once in my life I felt pretty!<br>  Tell your sister to keep at it because it really does work and just give it time to work.<br>  I'm so glad it worked on you :) <br>  It's an incredible feeling.|`|807312f4afa51e92aae2ac31c98a8b77aa	I was so excited when I saw how good Proactive worked for my sister in law. She told me it took a few days to see a difference. Once I got mine, I waited...and waited...and waited. I broke out worse than I had ever had in my whole life!!! I mean, it was really bad. It tore my skin up! After seeing a dermatologist she suggested Cetaphil. Since using it, my skin has been so much better, so much clearer, so much softer. You can buy it from Rite Aid, Walgreens...any store like that. Sometimes you just have to keep trying new things to see what works.|`|OndkYzHdaa	My skin has never been like horrible or anything but no one likes for their face to break out at all so i still tried proactive. It took like 2 weeks beefore I could tell a big difference. At first it seemed to work, but it started to dry out my face and if I didn't use it as much my face would get worse, so personally, I didn't love it.|`|lEVn5w0naa	Yeah ive got one it pretty much took 12 month to get better i had really bad looking face. i like it i also use shearcover that works too, ur sister should wait and uh it depends on age as well.

It also sounds like you might need a longer stud - if you still want to keep the piercing go to a closer piercers and ask them for a longer bar (they should have given you a longer one when you got it pierced because lip piercings do swell up - mine did for 2 weeks)<br>  <br>  Try ice as the other have said, but also try cleaning it with salt water. Boil some water and pour into a small container with some salt. Wait for the salt to dissolve and the water to cool (but not so it is cold - just so it won't burn you when you put it on). Gently wash the area with the salt water with a q-tip/cotton bud - do this a few times using a clean cotton bud each time. Then do the same on the inside of the mouth. You can also put a bit of the salt water in your mouth and swish it round gently.<br>  <br>  If you want to take out the ring you should wait until it is not so inflamed - the more you try to take it out when it is sore and bleeding the worse it might get (if you keep touching it any germs you have on your hands will be transferred to it.<br>  <br>  I couldn't take my eyebrow stud out once (for a job interview) so I got someone to VERY GENTLY(!) use a pair of pliars to get the ball off. <br>  If there is a piercers closer you could ask them to do it or someone who you know will be gently.<br>  <br>  If possible wear latex gloves when you or anyone else touches it because it will stop it from getting infected.|`|AA10590038	Sucking on some ice will help the swelling and pain go down usually very quickly.

Pimples which you see on your face develop since weeks ago inside your skin when oil accumulates in your skin mucous leading to inflammation. This is a natural process and everyone goes through it. Mostly people with an oily skin have to bear it more.  <br>  <br>  Apply a paste of turmeric powder with sugarcane juice to remove wrinkles and pimples.<br>  Take lemon juice. Dilute it in water. Apply externally. This is a very cheap Rx which everybody can afford. It works because of its antiseptic quality.

hISwD8tcaa	Well as your hair is shoulder length, how would you feel about getting a bob? You can get one thats longer at the front so that it still looks like your hair is long. Taking a lot off your ends may be needed as its in bad condition, and get your cut layered as this will make your thin hair look thicker and fuller. <br>  <br>  Once you get it cut, its important to get it cut regularly, even if just a tiny trim, to get rid of split ends and help your hair stay in good condition. <br>  <br>  If you blowdry/straighten/curl it then you really should use heat protective spray before you do so. Also when you wash your hair you can put a protective serum through it to help it stay nice and also give it extra heat protection. <br>  <br>  Finally... hair masks are good for locking in moisture and keeping your hair in good condition and renourishing it. Most brands do their own. Its like an intense treatment to be used approx once a week and you leave in your hair for about 5 mins after you have washed it and then rinse it out. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps, enjoy you new look!<br>  <br>  P.S- refraining from colouring til your hair is in better condition may be an idea too, but talk to your stylist for more advice as she will be able to see what can be done :) x|`|3xEbZuI2aa	Maybe you could have something put into it like layers or highlights.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should ask youre hairdreser what is the best thing to do because she cant really not do it for you because hat is her job.

Try bringing up the conversation and seeing what goes on from there.

The main thing to look for when purchasing earrings is that you buy nickel free earrings, this is the metal that most people with sensitive ears have a reaction to. If you are looking for affordable earrings, look for the brand Simply Whispers. It is sold at places like Claire's, Icing, etc and it is inexpensive as well as 100% hypo allergenic and you will not have any problems whatsoever. <br>  <br>  If you have the money to splurge on more expensive earrings, then I would recommend that you go with gold or titanium and shop at places like Zales and Macy's. That is if you have a ton of money to spend on earrings and can find fashionable styles that you enjoy. <br>  <br>  Good luck in your search!
kVBDpAMTaa	It can in some cases but it is probably just a hereditary thing. (Also, some medications can cause hair to thin.) I suggest using this shampoo:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.folica.com/Thicker_Fuller__d252.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.folica.com/Thicker_Fuller__d2...</a><br>  <br>  You can get this in a moisturizing type or a revitalizing. I know someone who uses the moisturizing kind and it works really well. But the revitalizing kind has good review so I'm guessing that works just as well. And I did realize you said that your hair isn't thin at all but if you are losing a lot of hair this shampoo will help just until that is over. =)<br>  <br>  I think you should cut back to washing your hair only once a day, that will help.<br>  <br>  If you have any questions feel free to email me!<br>  Hope this helps!
30iqJREVaa	They are about $500|`|ltnXWIpNaa	Cost depends on a number of factors.   The type of hair extension, the amount of hair used, the length of hair or the look desired.  Also, geography plays a part.  NYC, LA, Chicago, will be more expensive that smaller towns across the USA, due to expenses incurred by the salon.<br>  <br>  A top of the line hair extension system like Great Lengths, HairDreams, Remylinks, will cost more because of the premium nature of the hair.  It costs the salon more money to buy, hence the added costs to the customer.  To add body to hair, figure you need $600 and up, to add length, figure $1500 and up.<br>  <br>  There are more affordable methods.  In general with what I said earlier, the duration the extension lasts, plays a factor in price also.  If it last a couple of months, it will be cheaper than something that lasts up to 6 months.  You can get a system like UltraTress and Simplicity for around $500, which is an affordable option.<br>  <br>  Be careful just judging on price.  If it cost $200 for full head of hair extensions, stay away.  They will probably destroy your hair.  <br>  <br>  Use only 100% Natural Remy Human Hair Extensions.  Avoid Synthetic, and make sure the person is a licensed hair dresser.|`|g8WUpKjlaa	well,<br>  i've only had clip-ins before, but here's what i know.<br>  <br>  depending on the quality and length of the extensions, just the extensions alone could cost up to $150 USD, let alone having them put in by a professional.
spXPpyP0aa	no sorry hun
a1GwMzbnaa	I believe there's a way to show off your body without exposing too much in a flattering way. When anyone exposes too much, it makes me think they are insecure rather than confident. It's not sexy. It's just like you need attention to confirm that you think you look good even though looks don't necessary mean "you are hot"|`|FJU82Ycmaa	I think it's great for everyone to feel comfortable in their own skin!  I hate when they are referred to as sluts and stuff. People who call them names are just jealous.  I personally don't dress revealing, but I don't see anything wrong with it, as long as the girl is old enough to handle the responsibility with dressing provacatively.|`|13vcuAIxaa	I want people to remember me as a classy woman, and I personally believe that showing lots of cleavage is not classy. So I choose not to. But I try my best not to pass judgment on women who do.|`|fpS90nx4aa	i think it just depends on the event.if its to go party or clubbing then the shorter the better (free stuff) but if its to like a funeral or a wedding or a family thing maybe more dressed up and conservative would be nice|`|xB2wRYYBaa	no i hate it when women and girls my age walk around with there boobs practically hanging out.<br>  <br>  can they have more self respect than that?|`|4DP3RYwnaa	trying too hard to get attention.|`|qQXeAAgHaa	i think they are really trying to get noticed but me i just like go in and be my normal self wearing normal not low cut shirts and i am noticed without it

ed21623c8c2e89bbea50d192fee65b41aa	It is a powder foundation that doesn't contain nasty chemicals like liquid foundations do so it is good for your skin it contains spf 15 and can be used straight after waxing laser surgery and surgery|`|vVGjeGjPaa	True pure mineral foundation contains natural ingredients (even ingredients that promote healing) in it's recipe.   You have to do your homework though as not all mineral makeup is pure.  There are many companies that put fillers and unnecessary ingredients in them.  I am a fan of KmS Mineral Essentials.  It has done wonders for my complexion and it is very light; like I am not wearing any makeup at all.|`|Ys0kV4O8aa	Foundation that is good to your skin.

RBoZLMjBaa	I kept dying my hair platinum blonde. My hair went gross like horse hair and started to fall out. It looked nice but felt like crap. Its soooo not worth the up hill battle.<br>  <br>  And try not to keep dying it. Go to the hairdresser! It might cost you abit but it will save your hair!|`|6Tx8Opmraa	Platinum blonde doesn't look good on anyone who wasn't born with it. It looks fake, and then the roots come.|`|Aw4pbnYBaa	well its going to sting alot because of the bleach and get it professionaly or your going to be ginger<br>  x|`|XpkFWainaa	I just went through a whole platinum blond crazy deal - I had to dye my hair 4 times in three days to get it right, and even then I had to do home remedies to even out the tone.  You need to go to a stylist if you don't want brassy-blonds, or purple-craziness!  <br>  <br>  In the meantime - work a whole bunch of Extra Virgin Coconut Oil into your hair, and leave it in for about an hour.  Wash it out, use conditioner as usual, and then work in a small amount of the Coconut Oil to the ends as a leave in conditioner.  This is what I did in between each bleaching, and my hair is still soft.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

tWePoJYNaa	Yes people have the same reaction to cosmetology where I live to. I think it was because most of the girls at my school didn't know what else to do so they were slackers about it. The word cosmetology has a pretty bad rep! Unless you make it big and become famous, then it's glamorous. Don't worry about what people say. My hair stylist was in the same exact position as you and now she has her own salon! She worked very hard but now she's a small business owner. It's pretty sweet. You might also consider not just going into cosmetology school as just a hair dresser, but take classes (I don't really know what they offer) in a range of other things that would be relevant in a spa. My cousin's salon is also a spa and everyone that works there has some knowledge on massage or mask treatments. That way, you'll get paid more (as bad as the economy is right now, people are super stressed and still get massages or manicures to sooth them) because you generally get better tips at places like that. <br>  <br>  Good luck! If anyone makes you feel bad, don't let it get to you. Do what you really want to do!|`|AaXl3vcCaa	so you mean cosmetology school right........................ i worked at a hair salon and i am not against it, just know that it takes a while (years) to build up a clientele to make decent money
3E6Kz2ygaa	Omg, you look fine.<br>  <br>  Your nose is beautiful and your lips are beautiful too<br>  Some women really find thicker lips attractive!<br>  Your nose is fine. Its in proportion. You are a nice looking young guy. Don't believe those lies. You look nice<br>  <br>  I've seen African American men, and their noses were a little too big and their lips were too. Yours are nice. They are not too big. They are pillowy lips that you can lay on some lucky girl. I hate people with thin lips. Yours are very attractive.<br>  <br>  You have very nice, smooth looking skin too. You really think they are that bad looking? Some guys wish their noses weren't so skinny and bony, and thin lipped people cannot, i repeat, cannot kiss.<br>  <br>  Women pay thousands to inject their lips with stuff, etc. You are beautiful! I have a thicker lips and a wider nose like you. I used to think my nose was too 'wide', but my husband constantly says no.<br>  <br>  You should be thankful that you have such a nice 'creamy' looking skin. I'm not just saying that either. One of my best friends has a huge 'merlot stain' on her face, covering half of her face, and it's big and red, making that side of her face swollen. It blinds one of her eyes too. I could understand then. She would never complain if she had your nice features... <br>  <br>  You nice looking. don't take that for granted.<br>  <br>  God made you that way. And he loves you and how you look. Don't go and mess it up! You don't want to end up looking like Michael Jackson with his thin, surgery, grooooooosssssss looking nose. That's so NOT attractive.<br>  <br>  I personally love your lips and nose. Maybe you should take another look in the mirror. You probably hang around people who have more european faces and you feel kinda out of place. That maybe true. I know that if i was around people all my life who were black, I'd feel out of place too. I'd wish my hair was darker, and I'd be trying to tan constantly. Black women have a beautiful sort of beauty that whites can't imitate. You're skin can keep this certain satiny glow that white people can't achieve without help from a 'bronzer' or 'tanner' and it usually looks too orange and fake.<br>  <br>  Take pride in your race and embrace your lips and face. You are a very nice looking young man who I see a lot of potential! Don't waste time fretting over your looks all your life! You look great! And don't forget to moisturize that skin!|`|ZhVgTYPZaa	aww i think you're cute<br>  besides plastic surgery, there really isn't anything, sorry. but i think you look fine.<br>  get contacts maybe :)|`|WT108qwZaa	plastic surgery|`|AA12359047	You're cute.

4TfIV33Paa	You can barley notice it when you have it flipped.<br>  If someone is looking up your nose they might see it though.<br>  I flipped mine the same day I got it.<br>  But it hurt a little bit.<br>  People usually say wait for it too heal to flip it or flip it and let it heal.<br>  But I hid my septum from my parents for a week and they didn't notice.<br>  [until I told them I had it]<br>  I don't know how old you have to be to go get it.<br>  You can't see the hole or anything because it is inside of your nose.<br>  <br>  I've had my septum for 5 months and hasn't gotten infected. (:|`|Z5yxTK15aa	If your jewelery is the correct size it's not visible at all when flipped.<br>  You should wait at least a week or two to flip it, to avoid traumatizing the tissue.<br>  Not sure about the age, as mine was done after I turned 18 in Camden (i've taken it out since)|`|yKN1bpSJaa	Well my septum is at a 14 G but I am going to stretch it soon, and when I flip it into my nose people ask me if i took it out and ?I tell them no because you cannot tell that you have the piercing. I started flipping my septum in after about a week when I got it because my body didn't reject it. The advice that I will give you is Sea Salt Soaks, I say that because sea salt soaks clean your piercing and give it a faster healing time and it works wonders for me.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

I am a professional makeup artist and skincare specialist of 10years and I can tell you oil is not bad for your skin at all! In fact it is excellent for your skin, especially oily skin. Oily skin can benefit from nut oils like kukui nut, hazelnut and macadamia nut. Nut oils are very astringent on acne/oily prone skin they regulate the skin and make it supple. The mainstream cosmetic manufacturers and cosmetic companies are using ingredients that are horrible for your skin! They cause acne, contact dermatitis, greasy skin etc..... WHY? Becuase they are trying to sell you the cheapest product possible. They do not care about you or your skin. They are a business not a charity. Cosmetic companies spend 75% of their budget on celebirty endorsments/endorsing the product (which the celebrities do not even use this junk at all- trust me), 20% on the packaging and 5% on the actual product. Do you know what the ingredients are in most cosmetics? I will explain a few of them to you...............<br>  <br>  Propelyne Glycol- this is a big one that is used in almost all cosmetics, it is a greasy synthetic substance that is used as a lubricating agent in break fluid for your car. It is also used as a lubricator in cosmetics.<br>  <br>  Dimethicone- this is a synthetic ingredient from the silicone family. It is also a thick greasy substance that covers the skin and does not let it breathe, it can cause acne and clogged pores- in cosmetics it is used as a emollient (moisturizer). This ingredient is in face primers, moisturizers etc.<br>  <br>  Mineral oil- this one does a lot of destruction to the skin. Mineral oil is from the petroleum/petrol market (think gasoline) aka vasoline. It is used in a very large amount of skincare and foundations etc..... Mineral oils molecules are too large to penetrate the skin so they sit ontop of the skin clogging pores and causing acne. Thats not even mentioning the toxic chemicals that are sitting on your skin from this oil. It's gross.<br>  <br>  <br>  Now, for years I put these very products from Cover girl, Neutrogena, Clinique, Estee Lauder, Maybelline, Loreal, Mac, etc etc.... and never understood why I had the worst skin ever. It was these very products that had wreaked havoc on my skin. I now get compliments on my skin which is great since I had major acne in my past. You have to understand the mainstream companies TELL YOU OIL IS BAD and you need OIL FREE products just so they can use synthetic, chemical laden ingredients, Why? Because they are CHEAPER! It costs a heck of a lot more for JOJOBA OIL (which can actually help acne prone skin and works like the skins own natural sebum) than using synthetic based moisturizers. Synthetic moisturizers are chemicals, chemicals offer your skin nothing. Real oils have secondary benefits, not only do they moisturize the skin but they also contain natural occuring antioxidants that feed the skin, keeping the skin supple. I have been using a moisturizer by Faerie Organic called dewy glow moisturizer for my acne prone skin for years now. It has ingredinets like hazelnut oil, grapeseed oil, horsetail extract. Guess what? This is the best my face has ever been! It is healthy, clear and looks great. When I used drugstore brands, it was acne laden, greasy, and dry all at the same time! Dermatologists also work and are paid by mainstream companies backing their products. So they are known to recommend things like neutrogena. It is because they don't make money on selling you something you can obtain from nature. Believe me, if you tried going natural, you would see an amazing change in your skin. If you are interested in faeries products which I highly recommend you can see their site here......<a href="http://www.faerieorganic.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.faerieorganic.com</a> .............if you want to se whats in your cosmetics and how toxic they are you can see it here..........<a href="http://www.cosmeticdatabase.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.cosmeticdatabase.com</a>  GOOD LUCK!

qXvFsnOcaa	Loosing 5lb won't effect the size of your boobs, but as your boobs are one of the places that your body stores fat your boobs will shrink if you loose a lot of weight. Just look at athletes, you never see a sprinter or a gymnast with big boobs. It's because they have so little body fat.<br>  <br>  The same is true with men. Fat men develop man-boobs. A fat man can have bigger bobs than a woman.<br>  <br>  If you are worried about stomach fat your best bet is actually to improve your muscle tone. This will hold in your fat and make your body a better shape than dieting alone.<br>  <br>  White women tend to loose more boob fat than African American women, so if you are black you can loose a lot of weight without it effecting your boobs at all.<br>  <br>  Of course, if you are worried about your boob size you can always wear a push up bra or add some padding.

That one I can see.  If you drink through a straw for everything you ever drink, I would think that could cause those little wrinkles around the mouth that smokers tend to get.  But a straw here and there?  No.<br>  <br>  If you don't want wrinkles when you get older, wear your sunscreen; wear sunglasses that have UVA/UVB protection; don't smoke; don't be underweight; and look around at your family on both sides.  Genetics plays a big role.  How do they look?  Rule out the ones who smoked or worshipped the sun, and see how everyone else is aging.|`|jvWAiGSwaa	shes just crazy. <br>  i chew gum everyday <br>  & i dont have wrinkles.|`|enIZWv4caa	Oppostie of true.<br>  She just doesnt want you to cheew gum while singing...|`|Wa9Zr4HHaa	I've never heard this before.|`|FmKoukJbaa	what?|`|fvw664Ziaa	She is crazyy!<br>  I've never heard of that.<br>  hahaha|`|By1DJAUOaa	she crazy!|`|5mCm2XTLaa	It's an old wife's tale meant to discourage certain behaviors.

2ZsRAxkuaa	Downsize!<br>  <br>  They shouldn't ever bleed, or hurt much. If they are, then they aren't ready to stretch. Go back to at least 4mm, and wait a month before you try again.<br>  Sea salt soaks, just to clean out anything in there, and soak up any blood crusties. Then just leave the 4mm in. make sure its not acrylic. Apart from anything they smell. No roganics or silicone either.<br>  <br>  <br>  How long did you wait between 4 & 5mm? And did you use lube?|`|iTKSJwRPaa	Downsize to 4mm IMEDIATELY. What kind of plugs are you using? If you don't have sergical stainless steel, go out right now and buy some. Tapers are NOT for everyday wear, buy some single flared plugs. So not buy double flared until the hole is completely healed. You will never get them in without seriously ruining your ear. <br>  You need to do sea salt soaks 2 times a day now. This will save your ears. Mix 1/2 tsp UNIODIZED SEA SALT with 8 oz of hot water. Dunk cotton balls in the solution and hold one on each side of your lobe for 10 mins. Don't use table salt, you'll get chemical burns on your ears.<br>  Do not touch the plugs once they're in, don't rotate them or anything, the germs on your hands will infect them, you'll cause tiny tears to form if you rotate them, healing will take forever. And never use silicone, your ear will grow to them and you will never ever get them out.<br>  Let your ears heal for at least a month in between stretches. If it still doesn't look healed in a month, wait till it is healed. Stretching is a lengthy process. And always lube up your tapers with KY Jelly or any water based lubricant. <br>  Don't use neosporin or vasaline or anything other than KY/water based lube. <br>  If you do this, your ears will be perfect fine. Once they stop bleeding, rub the lobes with Vitamin E Oil to rebuild tissue so your lobes won't be thin. And squeeze your lobes and massage them hard, to break down any scar tissue that has formed.<br>  <br>  Follow these instructions and your ears will be good as new!<br>  <br>  EDIT: the sea salt soaks are how you clean your ear, don't clean them with rubbing alchohol or peroxide, that will dry out your ear.|`|Ll4yjTa7aa	i would suggest cleaning it with a cotten bud, some cooled boiled water with salt in it. get all the blood off and any puss<br>  maybe put a slightly smaller plug in.<br>  as you dont wana let is close up because if its infected then the infection will be stuck in your ear.<br>  if your a girl (i cant memba what your avatar said) then tie your hair up away from your ear and bathe your ear again before bed. sleep on the other side.<br>  o and up your fruit and veg to help it heal quicker!<br>  <br>  ps. when stretching you should moisturise the existin hole first to make sure the skin isnt dry and likely to crack. there is no need for the hole to bleed when stretching. and when actually stretching you could put some vaseline on the plug to make it easier to slide in

I would suggest first going to the tattoo artist, and trying to get it fixed before getting a cover up.|`|p3YD7qzvaa	You can get it covered up as soon as it heals. The only problem is that the tattoo will be dark because it hasn't had a chance to fade. Which will make it a little harder to cover up. <br>  <br>  Just keep in mind that you can't put anything you want over a tattoo to cover it. Black lines and black shading will need to be covered by black in order to not see it underneath the cover up.

This is because brown is complimentary to blue and would really make your eyes pop.  The color of your hair really doesn't play into what color eyeshadow you where.  I would avoid blues, greens, and purples because the colors are to alike to your blue eyes and will make them disappear with the rest of your face.  Brown is your best option.  Almay makes intense i-color for blue eyes that you can buy and it will look really good.|`|SXm75cZtaa	Eye makeup. The trick with eye makeup is putting on a neutral base ? either taupe, beige, light brown or ivory ? over the lid before applying any color. After the base is in place, accent color using shadows and eyeliners should then be applied to define the eyes. The accent color should match or be complementary to the color of your eyes. Afterwards, cap your eye makeup with mascara. <br>  For women with blue eyes, blues and slate grays are good accent colors, while medium brown is the perfect shade for the mascara. <br>  <br>  <br>  I hope that helps[:|`|aMqsLxMbaa	it depends if you have a really social personality. if so i might go with darker colors. and if u r a kind of quiet personality then i would go with somthing light like pink.|`|3TtAVcRIaa	try a brown color.<br>  blueish greenish eyes go really good with brown.<br>  :)|`|uoMsKhKNaa	well, u should do blue and put very little green in that<br>  <br>  hope i helped, and good luck w/that|`|W8RqiKbVaa	green or purple

You can try putting more conditioner in that part of your hair or even some leave in. And make sure you comb the entire knot out each time after you wash it. Also try brushing it before you go to sleep. Normally they're caused either by how you wear your hair or way clothes you wear. Sometimes hoodies (with the hood down) will cause them because that keep pushing that part of the hair up. Or if you're around fog or a fog machine a lot, since it puts moisture in the air and makes your hair expand.<br>  You just have to keep getting them out and eventually they should stop.|`|O9KcfH0Aaa	After using shampoo, put loads of conditioner all through your hair, and then take some time to comb your hair with a wide-tooth comb, you should find that it will go through your hair easily, and if there are any knots they will untangle easily. Leave the conditioner in for about 5 minutes (longer if you like) When you rinse your hair comb it through again. <br>  There are even some really good detangling conditioners, which you should find in most shops.<br>  Hope that helps.<br>  x|`|WOPRzF31aa	hiya <br>  if i had really bad not's i would try and wet my hair brush before brushing my hair.<br>  i hope this helps <br>  hana xx|`|60cwSqE9aa	When you wash your hair, use a conditioner.

TORBP6QIaa	I like Loreal Excellence...good quality and reasonable price, use a special shampoo and conditioner for coloured hair as well to help keep your colour longer. <br>  <br>  Blonde shouldn't fade away as it bleaches the colour/brown out of your hair but it can tend to go brassy after a week or two so you can use purple shampoo or toner to counteract that.  <br>  <br>  As you have brownish hair now chose a blonde shade about 2 shades lighter than you really want as the product has to bleach out the brown before it can deposit the new blonde colour and the bleach in a dark blonde will not be strong enough to do this.

They aim for highly visible designer bags that are recognized worldwide such as Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Dior, Gucci, Prada, Hermes, etc.   They will not waste time replicating handbag brands that are not well known around the world.  Oroton, despite that they are well crafted bags, are not targets of counterfeiters.  <br>  <br>  You have to educate your self on the brand name.  Preferably, you need to see an authentic designer bag in person and study the stiching, materials used and how they are priced.|`|edAtsw3waa	Well, for starters they usually come with a certificate of authenticity. The stitching is always in place with no loose threads, and there should be a sewed on label inside the bag with a stamp of the brand and a little number underneath.

Join a run for breast cancer<br>  2. have a yard sale where the proceeds go to breast cancer<br>  3. buy stuff where the proceeds go to breast cancer <br>  4. join a Charity/program for this cause<br>  5. visit someone who has brest cancer.<br>  <br>  And there are many more ways. if you really want to shave your head then do it but if you are felling unsure then trust your instinct and don't shave your head or you will regret it. :-)|`|8062aa648ee5f565e19730ddeaff579daa	I don't think its a good idea but if you do at least get something out of it. We have shave for a cure over here in Australia. It is where people sponser you to shave or colour your hair. The sponsered money then goes to the charity of your choice, in your case breast cancer.|`|jtYvSDZvaa	No. I dont really think so. There are other ways to support them. And if you shave your head, then you'll end up regretting it, and It will take forever to grow back out. STick with your own beautiful hair. Try earning money for breast cancer patients.

If you are:<br>  <br>  A GIRL: Probably not.

That's almost like mocking women with breast cancer|`|ALQuQaLGaa	No, I think that if you want to help people with cancer instead of shaving your head, it would be a better idea to donate SOME hair to that foundation that makes wigs for kids with cancer.  <br>  <br>  I think that we need to focus on curing cancer... it's good that you don't want them to feel alone but instead of shaving your head you should do something that really helps like donating money to research or a benefit concert.<br>  <br>  By the way it is awesome that you want to do something to change the world, you hear all these clichés about the youth of society.  It's refreshing that there are young people who are caring.|`|0AQF8pnKaa	Sure why not?

zon13nY2aa	The colour doesn't look bad at all!<br>  <br>  But if you want to go darker I would really recommend going to a hairdressers and getting it done professionally. It won't cost much at all and they will do the safest option for your hair. Also they will choose the right shade of brown to match your skintone. If you use a home dye kit you could end up in a right mess! And it's not worth the hassle just for the sake of saving a few ￡'s.|`|vFtdEejAaa	I quite like that colour. Anyways, you should probably go to your hairdressers or something like that, I wouldn't recommend doing one of those dodgy home colouring things, because that might end up turning it into an even worse colour.

But maybe 5 guys by 15, is kinda slutty.|`|mBVXgRLFaa	well, im 16 and still a virgin, if that counts for anything. maybe your just looking in the wrong crowd. and i would talk to her about it before you believe what others are telling you.<br>  <br>  i consider a slut to be someone who has sexual relations with someone they dont care for. i agree that it should mean something. your expectations are not too high, but maybe you should worry more about personality than whether or not they are a virgin. they may look back and regret it.|`|aXqi9lYJaa	I consider  a girl a slut when she is willing to have sex with anyone at anytime no matter what.<br>  <br>  Liek. She's known a guy for 2 hours, and they are off having sex.<br>  <br>  Or if she's just way to young. I don't consider her a slut if she's had sex with someone she loves at 17....but ya<br>  <br>  ur expectations aren't too high!|`|24Xy8qWtaa	No your expectations aren't too high but you've heard from other people..? Rumors aren't the best things to go by, approach her yourself and ask rather than listening to what the people around you say then go from there.|`|AA11634944	A slut isn't someone who has lost their virginity at a young age. We are only human and all prone to making mistakes. A slut is someone who has had sex, or engaged in sexual activites with, multiple guys over a SHORT PERIOD of time.<br>  <br>  Five guys may seem like several but if it's over the span of 30+ years then it's not so bad compared to a few days.<br>  <br>  Besides not having ones virginity doesn't make somebody any less of a person. It seems a little shallow to do so, but I guess it's your life and your the one missing out on getting to know some possibly wonderful people....|`|RvljVtVWaa	I wouldn't call her a slut if shes only slept with one guy.

You have to know that if you are ever going to make this move, that she is comfortable with it, and not a slut who will just have sex with you to say that she did.|`|ItCOMhYGaa	I can answer this perfectly. <br>  <br>  A slut is a girl that will do something with a boy before really knowing him and falling in love with him. Technically she will do him a service without socially being engaged with him. A slut is a girl who just goes from guy to guy. <br>  <br>  Dude im 18 and havent slept with a girl, I had 2 oppertunities but i passed them along because also like you, the girl i was going out with slept with a guy before me. I feel like we will never truly have anything when she lost her most priced possesion. <br>  <br>  The second reason is STD's each girl has them, your not behind times. your doing the best thing, if ur a guy, wait for that one girl who decided to wait for that one right guy. dont let that girl down who you will end up marrying. Because true love comes with all of the actions you commit today or tommrow.|`|drHzNxhxaa	A slut is s/o who sleeps with multiple guys w/o any emotional pretense just for the sake of doing it.  Almost on the line of prostitution.  Today people use that term loosly to describe any girl who has had sex.  This is usually a girl they dislike if they are using the term slut.  Usually when a girl looses her viginity at around 16 it is w/ someone she cares about and i would assume at 16 a person hasnt gotten around to as many partners as a prostitute. Therefore somone at the age of 16 CANNOT be a slut.<br>  It is natural for you as a virgin to be a little turned off by dating s/o who has been sexually active than you.  But if you really like s/o this should not get in your way.  If you want to take the relationship slower just let her know and if she cares about you she will take it slow with you.

Not like rotting fish.  These smelly oils are oxidized - which means they've gone bad, and will actually cause free radicals in your body.  <br>  <br>  One of the main causes of dry hair is a lack of zinc in your diet.  You can try Hair, Skin and Nails formula, in the vitamin brand of your choice.  Also, after you shower, take a small amount of Extra Virgin Coconut Oil (available and The Vitamin Shoppe - or your local comparative store), rub it between your palms to melt, and work through your hair.  Start at the ends, and make your way toward the scalp.  This is the most stable of all the oils, and has essential fatty acids your hair needs to repair itself.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|5gO6dM7Uaa	im thinking wash it. haha<br>  theres this stuff i use<br>  its called tea tree and its a shampoo and conditioner.<br>  it will cleanse and boost volumeee.<br>  just please wash it :D<br>  haha|`|6ozGEPdIaa	go to a salon and get hair treatments... in the meantime you can wear extensions...

RBoZLMjBaa	I think red curly hair is the sexiest look for a woman.<br>  <br>  Alas, I have straight blonde hair. =[|`|2R93bXBjaa	WOAH!  A SHORT RED HEAD?!  WHERE?!<br>  <br>  lol, I really like red hair :p|`|10LIhgtkaa	No, it's just unusual these days, what with everyone wanting to have blonde hair. I'm a redhead, so I'm a little biased lol, but I like being different. There were only like five people in my graduating class of five hundred+ that had red hair. Everyone wants to be blonde or brunette. That's the norm. She should be glad she's not like everyone else, and try to talk her out of dying it if she gets discouraged. Red hair doesn't usually let go of dye very easily.<br>  <br>  As for the leprechaun thing, tell her to read up on them on wikipedia or something. It's actually quite complementary if you go by the old legends. Leprechauns generally are cunning creatures that outwit humans and are adept at trickery.|`|lbb4luo2aa	i think red hair is gorgeous, im a brunnette and wish i couldve been born with natural red hair. its just so rare and pretty ^.^<br>  <br>  if she takes good care of it, itll be great. <br>  <br>  tell her to ignore the mean kids, they are just childish.<br>  tell her to be proud though, she has something rare that i would die for! hehe|`|s5qR22UKaa	I find  most girls with red hair to be extremely sexy.|`|JXTPydxJaa	2 words.

Adult?  Most red-heads are awkward growing up, but once they get to the point where they can embrace the uniqueness of their beautiful hair, they become some of the most sought-after individuals.<br>  <br>  Tell your friend to laugh off the "insults" and wait - she'll see.  (or he?)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|l9JfiYvZaa	I think red hair is pretty... but natural red hair is light and usually comes with light brown freckles. Oh God.

XaYHMNusaa	Piercings can get infected at any time, all they need to do is come in contact w/ foreign bacteria and it'll happen [mostly for healing piercings].  You should try to go to the doctor to get antibiotics but DO NOT take the jewelry out.  If you take it out the skin could heal over the infection, trapping it inside of your ear, forming an abcess.  Also, ditch the rubbing alcohol [way too harsh for piercings] and do sea salt soaks.  I'll link you the info.|`|mRgRDhMQaa	the metal from your earring probably irritated the piercing in your earlobe. always make sure to clean your earring backings and metal off with alcohol or ear piercing cleaner before you put them on. the lady who pierced my ear said i was allergic to fake jewelry so I try to clean them good or they irritate my ears. you should remove it and clean it|`|DmLY2R5Gaa	this happened to me a few weeks ago<br>  <br>  i had my seconds done about 10 weeks ago - so mine got infected after 7ish weeks :S<br>  <br>  anywhoo - <br>  get some warm/hot but not too hot water and add salt to it<br>  stir the salt around until its almost dissolved <br>  then get some cotton (not a cotton bud, actual cotton, like fluffy stuff) or a tissue and dip it in the salt water<br>  DO NOT take the earing out, because the hole is most likley going to swell together and it will e painful to put the earing back in after. <br>  just bathe around the earing and actually squeeze some of the water onto the ear lobe<br>  <br>  trust me, this will work  :)<br>  <br>  do it once everyday, before you go to bed for a week <br>  after about 3 days you can take the earing out and clean it and also get some more of the water in the earlobe without having the earing in the way<br>  <br>  hope this helped :D|`|whD25cV5aa	Don't remove the piercing because if you do it will trap the infection and you'll end up with a big pussy abcess - not pretty.<br>  <br>  By the sounds of it you've over cleansed, rubbing alcohol is way too strong for new piercings. Try a sea salt soak - about a quarter of a tsp to a cup of warm water. The strongest thing I've used is germolene - and not a lot of it.<br>  <br>  I'd avoid removing the earring and putting it back in because if it's swollen the hole could swell over very rapidly, meaning you not only ended up with a scarily infected lobe but also a healed up piercing.|`|WytfaeWeaa	i took mine out and cleaned my ear and the earring but then put it straight back in. <br>  .as long as you don't give it time to heal over you should be okay <br>  i think you should use savlon that is what my sister got recommended you can get it from loads of shops x

kXTYqfXcaa	Your mom pulled it out? S***.<br>  <br>  First things first. Don't argue or get pissed off, because then she'll think you're a moody teenager going through some kind of "phase". Don't scream/shout or even disagree with her, listen to her and stay calm at all times. You'll have to do this for a while so she thinks that you really are mature. Parents are much less likely to let you do things like piercings if you scream or argue, because they think you're too immature.<br>  <br>  Next, figure out a good case. Okay, you're 16. Old enough to move out, old enough to leave school, old enough to have sex, so.....why not old enough to get something inserted into your lip? Point out that you're at an age where you are able to make these kind of decisions for yourself. Tell her that this isn't just a "phase" or impulsive thing, that you've thought about it and that you really do want a piercing. Figure out why she won't let you get one: if she's worried about safety and health then make her understand it's safe. If she thinks it looks terrible then explain to her that it's your own body, your own style, and that while you understand why she may be concerned, you still are old enough to make your own decisions. Get your case right. Don't say any of this impatiently, or rudely: NEVER shout. Say it calmly and like an adult. Remember that you should only bring this up when all of your previous discussions/arguments have died down. And bring it up maturely - "Mum, I want to talk to you about this piercing issue." If that sounds too stupid, then just say, "Mum, I think you're not being fair about my piercing my lip, I don't want to fight but I want to talk about it." <br>  <br>  If she argues back, remember to stay cool and mature, and calmly defend your points. You really ARE old enough to do this kind of thing, in my opinion, considering the other things 16 year olds are allowed to do. You can try to strike up a deal: If you get really good grades, you can get the piercing, if you take on extra chores, etc. Work well in school and try not to do things that may annoy her, to prove that getting a lip piercing isn't going to transform you into the child of hell.<br>  <br>  If she still doesn't allow you to get your lip pierced, work on her. If you're absolutely positive that she's not going to give in, then stuff it and get the piercing anyway. :) If she tries to pull it out again, stay away from her. Remind her that you are legally old enough to drive, to move out, that you would have gotten the piercing at 18 anyway and therefore she doesn't have a right to force you to take the piercing out. Still stay calm and mature.  It sounds like your mum is the uptight controlling type who hates metal music, dark clothes and piercings - I may be wrong but that's how she comes across. If so, then don't panic, because at 16 and a half, she really can't physically pull out a piercing, or not allow you to get one.|`|8j70Neqeaa	I myself think its gross, I dont blame your mom, when your 18, then go do it.|`|AA10729271	leave it alone or you'll end up with a scar if she has to pull it out again. what's the rush? your lip isn't going anywhere's is it?|`|1b4u5Ch7aa	mind your mom its that simple i think they look trashy|`|FJZIvANFaa	Just get it done .... & when ever u see your mom just cover it up with your hand (Y)|`|DFI5KsFAaa	Why would you want to?|`|oS3exSTiaa	i just got snake bites in november, honestly i just<br>   went and got them done came home and showed her, she was PISSSED so im not saying<br>  that your mom will like it but after a month they just got used to them<br>  no biggy.<br>  <br>  WATCHOUT though she'll probably bust out the <br>  "you cant get a job with those things in your face" card|`|lPnjjFkjaa	There really isn't a way cause those piercings are so unattractive.|`|uxsAL8sXaa	Tell her to get one herself that she would look hip.|`|OJOt0Uyxaa	Just do it...
2ZsRAxkuaa	You're not gonna be able to hide it unless you're away for a couple of weeks on your own. A weekend is not enough time for the swelling to go down and to talk and eat normally. It might be, but its more than probably not.<br>  <br>  If you do go away for a week or so, and get it pierced, its quite unnoticeable with a Blackline ball, as it isn't so shiny then.<br>  <br>  A retainer will not be a good idea while its healing. Acrylic ones are very bad for new piercings, and quartz and other ones, the o-rings would fall off quickly, and you'd swallow it.<br>  <br>  Plastic ones are bad because they're porous, and all the germs live in there, and you can't clean it. Do is quartz to a small dgree, but its not nearly as bad.<br>  And acrylic is bad because your body breaks it down, and it releases acrylic acid, which is bad. It irritates the piercing. And acrylic and alcohol will cause it to crack, and it retains odours. Acrylic retainers are either used with o-rings (which fall off and get eaten) or acrylic balls (which crack and get chewed) Neither is a good idea. <br>  Dental acrylic is sometimes okay in fresh piercings. But its best not to risk it.<br>  PTFE is okay for retainers, but you'd need a steel ball on the end, and then you may as bell just have a steel barbell too.<br>  <br>  Sorry, I'm babbling on a bit...<br>  <br>  Anyway, I use these:<br>  <a href="http://www.bodyjewelleryshop.com/online_store/blackline_barbells_16mm_with_4mm_balls_2943142.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bodyjewelleryshop.com/online_...</a><br>  They're not as shiny, and as long as you don't open your mouth too much, very good at being discreet.<br>  Most piercers would probably have to order them in though I imagine, though they might have the black balls.<br>  <br>  I'd try and stay at your friends house all week. Say you have a study project or something? Or a camping holiday etc...|`|97b7d9795e7ae2ee4648b9cbb2fe32a4aa	seriously your not going to hide it. theres a metal ball on your toungue! but make sure you dont go home before the swelling goes down. they'll notice it even quicker! my dad took me for my 18th bday. it hurt like hell but was def. worth it. i loved having it done. <br>  <br>  anyways. you might get away with it for a few days. maybe even a couple weeks. but eventually youll forget its there and do something and theyll notice. or theyll notice when your talking or laughing!!<br>  <br>  be careful and goood luck =]

It actually works best on coarse dark hair and also clears up skin irregularities (pigmentation etc) too.  Its not so expensive now either...worth a look into.  The other product I like is those instant wax strips...cheap, quick and convenient.

e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	If you want to run out and pick up some products locally, I recommend trying the following:<br>  - Drugstore: L'oreal out of bed weightless texturizer (black tub, use under gel), LA Looks or Herbal essences gels, Suave naturals or vo5 conditioners, L'oreal vive pro hydra gloss or nutri gloss for curly hair, red Cream of Nature shampoo<br>  - Organic/specialty store (like whole foods): Giovanni Direct Leave in condish, G conditioners, G tea tree shampoo, Aubrey Organics Honeysuckle Rose or White Camellia Conditioners, AO B-5 Design gel<br>  - ULTA: Devacurl products, Biosilk rock hard gelee, MOP-c curl defining cream (They also carry drugstore products and giovanni.)<br>  <br>  These are all good things I have used, but be sure to tinker around with amounts and how you use any products. For hair type specific products check out these forums:<br>  <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/</a><br>  There you can find others with the same hair type and try out some of their favorite products. However, the most popular ones are usually only available online.<br>  <br>  Here are some basic tips for curly hair that you might find helpful:<br>  *Try to find a stylist who knows how to work with curly hair. You can find reviews by region here: <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons</a><br>  *Don't shampoo every day.<br>  *Comb conditioner through hair in the shower.<br>  *Apply styling products to dripping wet hair. Scrunch or twirl hair to achieve desired shape.<br>  *Use styling products suited for your hair type. Don’t know yours? <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types</a><br>  *Avoid terrycloth towels on hair; use linen, paper towels, or t-shirts instead.<br>  *Air dry or use a diffuser with your blowdryer.<br>  *Don't touch (or brush!) your hair while it’s drying.<br>  *Once completely dry scrunch out any crunchy texture.<br>  <br>  Lastly, it has made my hair so much better since I started the curly girl method! I used to almost never wear it down (it was a frizz/poof ball), but now I have pretty, shiny curls. ~:) It’s pretty radical—no sulfates (shampoo) or silicones—but it’s so great for curly hair. Give it a shot and check it out:<br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Follow-the-Curly-Girl-Method-for-Curly-Hair" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Follow-the-Curly-...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ylcf.org/gotcurl/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ylcf.org/gotcurl/</a> (outdated product recs!)<br>  <br>  Some other great curly care sites: <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/jessicurl" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/jessicurl</a><br>  <a href="http://livecurlylivefree.com/home.htm" rel="nofollow">http://livecurlylivefree.com/home.htm</a>|`|kXTYqfXcaa	Try good quality brands like Pantene or Herbal Essence. You can use an anti frizz shampoo, and then a straightening shampoo to down tone the frizz. After washing, rinse with icy cold water to lock in shine and make it more smooth.<br>  <br>  If you towel dry your hair, don't rub it because the friction also causes frizz. If you dry it after washing remember to leave it a little damp. Dry hair means frizzy hair, so every time before you get into the shower to wash your hair, massage it through with olive oil, or hair serums. You can also use a tiny, coin sized amount of olive oil to comb through your hair. It works really well for frizz, trust me.<br>  <br>  As for grease, wash enough times to combat the greasiness. Shampoo with lukewarm water and avoid too hot temperatures.

qMCv8mOCaa	See your friendly neighborhood tattoo artist. They will need to see your skn to see if it will give you the effect that you are looking for.  I doubt that it will though. white touches up other colors well to make them pop but may not give you the contrast that you are looking for. I would suggest heavy black against your natural skin color but you do need to talk with an artist.|`|RNUO5vGMaa	You asked this question twice, hun.<br>  White ink is out there. Grey if you dislike the idea.<br>  White ink, in my opinion, looks very good unless you're super super dark.<br>  Ask the tattoo artist in question.

F0sfmZFnaa	I did the SAME EXACT THING one time!!!! Here is what you can do:<br>  <br>  One, I guess you can always get an eyebrow pencil that people use when they HAVE no eyebrows and fill in - make sure you get the right shade!!!<br>  <br>  Here is what I did...its a little weird, but it works. At the time, I had some dark brown, waterproof mascara. I actually dabbed just a little on the place where I messed up and smeared it to wear it blended it. You couldn't even tell!!!! I guess you could also do the same with a dark brown eyeliner pencil.<br>  <br>  Good luck...it will take about 2-3 weeks to grow back.|`|c0e2daf7f34839e4570138b1a560aeabaa	it takes a long time to grow back, depends how fast your hair grows. to cover it up you could use eyebrow filling stuff...idk what its called, but it works.|`|3W2KpXx9aa	go to a saloon and fix them up for 7 -10 bucks|`|eCFbnXYiaa	i actually don't know how long it takes for eyebrows to grow back, because everyone is different. but hairs do tend to grow back pretty darn fast. if it doesn't grow back in time, i recommend you go to the store and either get eye liner, lip liner, or [if there is] an eye brow liner that is the color of your eye brows, and then try and fill them in.<br>  Best of luck,<br>  Sarah

r4i7xPnMaa	Some facial cleansers work pretty well at taking off eye makeup. Just make sure you get a VERY VERY gentle one (Like Johnson & Johnson Purpose facewash, which is proven to be as gentle to your eyes as water. I swear by this stuff). <br>  Ooooor, Almay has a really fantastic eye makeup remover. You can either buy a bottle of the stuff and use it on cotton balls, or you can buy the pre-moistened jar of little pads. It's hypoallergenic, and very gentle, and yet it still gets the job done.<br>  <br>  HOT TIP: Don't wear waterproof mascara unless you absolutely must. Like, if you're going swimming or something. Otherwise, waterproof mascara is the same as regular mascara, but a lot harder to get off at the end of the day.|`|519Cs3Tyaa	yes if you don't it can cause eye infections also when you remove the mascara the best way to do so is with eye make up remover and a cotton ball applying the remover to the cotton ball wiping the lashes gently from underneath|`|s3d7TNH6aa	well start with eyemakeup remover and a cotton ball. so you want to slid the cotton ball across the eyelid when your eyes are closed. you dont want to slide down because this could make your eyelashes fall out|`|BrDEyUZraa	use the neutrogena makeup removing wipes|`|73475eae4295c9287e6a745ce17ee685aa	use an eye makeup remover..

They are 18 pounds each and you need 3, they are not the cheapest but they are definately the best ones you can get. The other ones just look cheap, tacky and fake and would be a total waste of money.<br>  I have tried a few and these are the best by far, when i have them in everyone comments ono how good they are and how real they look.

xGmbEzOZaa	Wash your face with a cleanser designed for oily and acne prone skin. It will usually contain salicylic acid. This kills bacteria, but also dries out your skin. You'll need to put on toner and a light moisturizer (oil free) to keep your skin hydrated. Of course, apply an acne medication. It will most likely contain benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, or a combination of the two.<br>  <br>  Breakouts can be eliminated by exfoliation or by using nose pads. However, they always tend to come back. Therefore, you need to exfoliate once a week (no more because it will irritate your skin).<br>  <br>  For the overall health of your skin, drink lots of water (64-fluid ounces a day - that's usually eight full glasses). Also, eat lots of greens, vegetables, and fruits. Stay away from oily foods and things that are obviously not good for your health. Food does not directly cause acne, but contributes to the production of certain hormones in your body which cause acne. Do not touch your facial skin because the oil from your hands can contribute to more acne on your face. Try not to stress and get good sleep each night.<br>  <br>  Wishing you the best.|`|AA11878029	clay mask...|`|eeP9Xp8Laa	I have the same problem.<br>  Except I have breakouts in random places.<br>  But, I heard from somewhere that drinking water will help.<br>  And I was desperate, so I tried drinking water through the day instead of juices, cokes. etc..<br>  And, after a few days/ a week I noticed a difference.<br>  Since then, I pretty much only drink water and drink something else rarely.<br>  I drink 3-5 bottles a day.<br>  I never get break outs. :]<br>  So I suggest doing this, and it also helps with my oily skin too.|`|qeNrGoMsaa	If you can afford it or if your doctor can refer you at no charge to a dermatologist go for that. You may need that extra boost of what the doctor can do. She often has samples too that you can try.<br>  If not try a good cleansing product like Spectro gel. and use a toner after and a moisturizer lastly(Non oil based and alcohol free). Remember a lot goes a long way. Don't pick at them either and keep your hands away. Blot excess oil when you can with blotting tissues. On weekends take a break from make up. Use a spot treatment on just the areas you need it. aspirin smashed up and wet will work on those stubborn pimples.|`|87Yhfk5Faa	wash your face before bed and in the morning<br>  change your pillow case and pajama 2 or 3 times a week<br>  use a moisturizer to prevent dry skin <br>  (:<br>  give it time........|`|pxlu5Wgqaa	Use spectrogel and clean your face before going to bed and in the morning.

HnEcgVGiaa	Hi Amy,<br>  <br>  It looks like you're trying to lose weight and tone your body. First, don't stress over it. Stress is one of the factors that contribute to unhealthy body. Your muscles respond well to your mind, so keep a positive outlook.<br>  <br>  Consider the diet that I told you about earlier. Whenever you consume carbs, such as bread, stick to whole grain and wheat bread. That means no white bread, which contains a lot of sugar. Put some protein in your diet. Not only does it provide you with the necessary ingredients for muscle building and toning, it actually fills up your tummy without much calories. However, try to stay away from red meats and try poultry, fish, diary, and soy products. Surprisingly, milk also promotes a healthy body and can help you to lose weight. Of course, stick to low-fat or fat-free milk. Instead of that chocolate bar for a snack, grab an apple or a bowl of mixed fruits. Get a variety of fruits from the grocery (apples, strawberry, pineapple, bananas), blend them, and make yourself a smoothie. They're taste good and are good for you too!<br>  <br>  So many people try a low-carb diet, but for many, this does not work. It is because your body automatically absorbs whatever calories and fat it can get and reserves them in your body, if you have a low metabolism. You can increase your metabolism through many ways. <br>  <br>  1. High-protein diet.<br>  2. Exercises that lets you to work out different parts of your body in different ways. Don't stick to just a single routine and repeat it every week. You have to mix things together so that your muscles won't adapt to your routines. You must make them work - feel them burn.<br>  <br>  If you're going to do sit-ups, do them correctly. Lie flat on your back and push yourself forward so that your chest touches your thighs. Do a couple of reps, increasing the intensity and frequency each week.<br>  <br>  Swimming takes a lot of energy and is a fast calorie-burner. If you have the opportunity to go swimming, I suggest you take it.<br>  <br>  You say that you have a flat belly (a lot of girls will be jealous by that!), so all you need to do is concentrate on building that ab muscle rather than getting rid of belly fat.<br>  <br>  Body training takes time and patience. People will have different results and will take different time to achieve their goals. Don't expect your body to change into a supermodel in a few weeks. Keep working at it even if you can't visibly see the difference at first.<br>  <br>  Good luck Amy!<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  <br>  Brian|`|e2WRJyhsaa	if you don't like muffin tops, then stop baking muffins!!<br>  <br>  but seriously, have you tried sit-ups? are you opposed to liposuction? you may also be wearing pants that are too small. if you're buying them to fit below the waist but they're too tight at the waist, consider buying a different style that has more waist room. if all else fails, try pants that come high enough to cover your handles.

It'll make your eyes pop a lot. And it's got a gorgeous cut!<br>  <br>  The first one's really pretty, it probably isn't quite enough by itself, but you could dress it up. The ONLY reason I don't say the first dress is because sometimes white on a fair skin tone can make you look kind of sickly. That all depends on your exact skin tone, though. <br>  <br>  I think the red would wash you out too much. Red usually looks better on a darker skin tone, like in the picture of it.|`|Joje6y1zaa	3rd dress!<br>  deffinately!<br>  <br>  red is my favorite color.<br>  the way the dress does up the leg is phenomeonal.<br>  =D<br>  <br>  have fun!|`|kz13su6Yaa	my favorite is the 1st. then 3rd. then 2nd.|`|24sK6L2uaa	I don't think the first one is prommy enough but it is pretty.

I it is really pretty. I kinda like the second one but i would go with the first one. I think that the first one would only really look good with medium/long hair. If you have a bob or something like that, then i would recommend the second. <br>  <br>  p.s I hated my prom dress. I looked like a black mushroom. I had a bob and a knee length plain black cocktail dress.

I'm not sure i likee the second one. And the first one is cute, but not for prom :)|`|ASdDQx3Kaa	I really love the first one! I wouldnt worry if its not too fancy. Wouldn't you rather go to prom in a dress you love and stand out in, than in a dress thats generic? Just my opinion. If you're afraid the white will wash out your skin tone, you can get a tan at a salon :)|`|zjXgLSRyaa	I love all 3 and can see the dilemma you are in!  Personally I like the 1st one as it is so different but with a fair skin tone you may just blend into the dress.  If they had it in a darker colour i would immediately say the 1st one :D<br>  Out of the 3 you have there the cut of the red one is my favourite and I don't think many people would have a dress the same.  The green would suit your eyes really nicely though!<br>  This is a decision only you can make as you are the one who needs to be happy with your dress.  The only thing I can suggest is getting a dress made because then it will be just what you want.  I had my dress made and it wasn't too expensive.  Good luck and I hope you have a lovely prom|`|q79ukKuRaa	I feel like the 1st one isn't dressy enough. <br>  I really like the 3rd one. (:|`|lkokBxvWaa	You should go for the first one. Bows are in and that dress is sexy. I would wear that, and with that ivory colour it will flatter you.

It's nice enough.<br>  But if your really concerned about that or the length of the dress, I think you should go with the last one, the red one. & I think your right about the second one. It looks like it would be way too trendy.|`|ciM3prM6aa	I really love the first one, the style of it is so cute. And I love the third one too, the color is gorgeous. (: So if i was going for a prom dress id go for the red one because its more fancy.|`|y2gBPwUVaa	i loved the first dress i think its really pretty, i agree with you though it might not be fancy enough for prom. <br>  i like the others one but not as much, if you like the first one more then i would just go for it|`|O8h55uszaa	I think you should go with the last one, it's beautiful.But just as long as you don't pick the middle one, we're good.Nothing against it but it's soo traditional prom dress-ish.Ya know?<br>  You have good taste though:)|`|xelv7U4Waa	i love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love the first one :D<br>  <br>  the white one is adorable!<br>  i think it is perfect and it certainly dressy enough.<br>  loveeeee itttt!<br>  <br>  haha :D<br>  good luck :D|`|Gb5drFqJaa	the first and second are cute, i hate the third. stay away from anything that style.|`|ablLHnOMaa	the last two were gorgeous- the green and red<br>  <br>  not sure were u lived but they wud look stnnin at a prom<br>  <br>  i live in england and the last two prom dresses are not typical<br>  <br>  thewy wud stand out and luk gawjus|`|GmlwDL8vaa	I say the first one.<br>  <br>  Being stylish, not too showy, I don't like the satiny look for prom dresses, it looks too homecoming.|`|0uSPPAb5aa	The first one is perfect ! Its the only one of the three that does not look like a stereo type prom dress. Just be sure to wear some accent jewelry to set it off.|`|7JYpCppJaa	i love the second one. it looks as though you can look cute without showing off (:|`|4GUpQxWdaa	3rd one...1st definitely isn't formal enough|`|Pl4zNuFKaa	The red one is my favourite and the white one is 2nd.  Not so keen on the green one though! x|`|NlRt5VF8aa	I really like the first one.|`|s3yj0MFeaa	maybe the green and red i would rather get the  green it cute<br>  <br>  answer mine <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090308115337AAOS7XE">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|aR0hjmKoaa	i like the red one|`|ZlXNNna6aa	1 && 3.<br>  i dont really like the 2nd one.<br>  <br>  but the 1st one is ADORABLE!<br>  and so is the 3rd.<br>  <br>  if i were you id wear #1. :)|`|p1xpa0kbaa	I say third one, going with red ids never wrong!|`|pWwj75oJaa	2nd and the third are both REALLY pretty, and totally wouldn't blend in with the crowd.

Don't dye it.|`|puMD6tcQaa	Nici never did it for me....  I like black, brown, beige, blonde, beigeish brown, beigeish black or red.  I would leave the color alone...

Lightest blonde or darkest chestnut.|`|53Yp0Zsmaa	either go totally brown with some red hgihlights.<br>  or totally black.<br>  or dirty blonde.|`|AA10721549	i'd rather change the look of your album. the hair is just awesome - unlike the album|`|iDBVFTHlaa	I hate to tell you, but I love your natural color. I wish I had that color hair, but I know you want what you don't have so maybe go a little darker red, like an auburn mixed with some brown. You could get a shoulder length cut with layers if you want a change from your long hair!|`|pgUfi7XMaa	i think you should keep it the way it is! def!  you have really pretty, curly, voluminous hair.. that really makes your face "pop". so my advice would be to keep it the way it is...|`|o6QOb5A9aa	Your hair is gorgeous! The style and the colour!<br>  If you really want to change it, I think a dark brown would look really warm, and lovely.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|ThNC4f1kaa	What are you nuts. This looks hot. I can't stand fake hair colors.|`|8UF98Vixaa	i think you should dye ur hair a med or dark brown... and i think maybe sholder hair

HyAvpatCaa	i am 13 too, ill give you some secrets to relly good skin, i use them and i have clear glowing skin, use soam and water every day (make sure you scrub off dead skin with a lufa ), once thats done, get some baby lotion and squirt some on some cotton wool. do this every day and afer a few months, your skin will be so pretty<br>  tip  - do NOT use makeup, it only hides your face from the sun, and your skin will become pale and horrible.|`|jKBQgwEqaa	try clean and clear|`|PeI5rpK1aa	My skin gets like that. I usually just put a little bit of gentle shampoo on my face and it gets rid of the oil. A natural shampoo would be best for this so it's not to harsh on your skin but it works better than the oil removing stuff they charge $20 for. <br>  Wash your face as many times as you like but the stimulation will make you produce more oil. So be gentle. <br>  Avoid using much make-up as that will cause more acne too.
awzXuJMDaa	Although I am quite sure that you know what you look like, we can't see your face and body in those pictures, so your question is impossible to answer. Are you 5' 1" and weigh 350 pounds, 6' 2" and weigh 140 lbs, is your hair long, short, blonde, brunette? All of these as well as just general appearance are definitely factors.|`|gJBqAXwtaa	outfit no.1 is my favourite<br>  altho if the top is quite long i would probably wear like grey leggings or gray tight or something like that with it unstead of jearns with pumps, of a simular colour or black to match the wiriting on the top.<br>  <br>  i would say the gray cardigan not the stripey one.<br>  nice!|`|HeOwMaxaaa	you have the worst taste in clothes.<br>  <br>  unless your 50+?|`|b1znvwnJaa	Since you're slim, I would go with skinny jeans with the top in outfit one.<br>  Ohh, in outfit three, how about straight jeans ... defo not skinny jeans.<br>  <br>  I like the stripy top better.<br>  <br>  Jacket maybe, not shrug with outfit one!|`|8v5YatPsaa	i like the first top but would look better with dark skinny jeans or black leggings, a short leather jacket would go really well not sure bout what kind of shoes though, maybe plain white trainer/pump things of just plain black pumps.|`|85hX02iEaa	outfit 1-4 (not that ... u no)<br>  and btw i think that the second one u no the <a href="http://www.newlook.co.uk/women/knitwear/..." rel="nofollow">http://www.newlook.co.uk/women/knitwear/...</a><br>  is better :D|`|p3GZERIsaa	I'd say if your around 12-14 then yeh they're ok looking :] Very simple and casual though, and i think grape and black cardis look good :]|`|5IQVD6efaa	Outfit #1:<br>  I dont like the jeans with it. I would try some tights of leggings and cute flats with that top.<br>  Outfit #2:<br>  Very cute! Love it.<br>  Outfit #3:<br>  Love the top. I would just pair it with some jeans, preferably a dark wash. Also, what would look cute is some black boots with the jeans tucked in and a black belt around your waist.<br>  Outfit #4:<br>  Also sounds cute.<br>  <br>  and I prefer the striped cardigan.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|cvkUdgwGaa	okay so, they first outfit wear with leggings instead of jeans, but if you REALLY wanna wear jeans then go with elegant skinnies.  <br>  <br>  outfit number 2, i don't like it sorrry.  the jeans are okay but the shirt is eh :/  <br>  <br>  outfit 3, it's just a long sleeved shirt, wear cute sweats with it, like from victoria secret, or skinny jeans and put one of the cardis you have at the bottom with it.  <br>  <br>  and i don't like the fourth shirt :/  <br>  <br>  also i like both cardigans at the bottom, the first one i think you should get in atlantis.  <br>  <br>  <br>  hope i helped !|`|9u74rP70aa	outfit number 1s the best you should pair the top with some wet look leggings and killer heels, finish the outfit off with the a cropped leather jacket,<br>  the other outfits are casual and abit plain you should dress them up with some nice jewellery|`|WDEWAR8Faa	outfit 1 because it goes more to be honest and out of them to nitwere tops i would buy the first one in the sunset colour|`|nLU4dQspaa	it depends on the occasion are you going for ,also what age you are.

Some people will, others won't.<br>  <br>  If it's bothering you, wax them... shaving them will make them grow back even stronger (body's defense mechanism). Waxing however, since they're getting pulled out, damages the hair follicles that let them grow... so when the hair does grow back it'll be weaker and less in number (or at least not getting any hairier). You'll want to wax, right? :)|`|L2dxBXQRaa	I do, but they're light ones. And no.|`|jeirfdpyaa	i dnt have any. <br>  Just checked. lol.x|`|2S2onP86aa	All girls do, but usually very light hairs.

ZkrGttKaaa	Gotcha. Colorfully done by an expert you trust, sleeves or half sleeves look great on girls, as well as guys. Since it's such an important consideration, you might try looking at some magazines down at the tattoo studio. Inked Magazine does specials every month on women and their tattoos... you want to find a style of art that really grabs you, something that when you see it, you go "That's what I like, and I'm gonna beat on doors till I find someone who does work like that!" Women are the fastest growing group of young people getting ink in the U.S. and the U.K. right now. Choose good stuff, you've got time. Take care.|`|LcAiHBsaaa	Wow, what a nut case! (first answerer...)  You would obviously wear a wedding dress to your wedding, and what you usually wear to your grandparents house... and usually when people get as much work done as a sleeve/half sleeve they think about it for a while, so no... it's not going to be something tacky when they're older.  I have a full back piece and I hear that C R A P all the time.  ANNOYING! Jeez... <br>  <br>  Anyhow, as others have said, I think it would be great!  Guys are very split on the issue... ironically enough, I notice a lot of guys with tattoos don't like girls to have a lot of tattoos if any, and guys with no tattoos usually like the girls with tattoos.  Ha!  Do what you want and what you like... you'll find someone who thinks you're rad, tattooed or not!  If someone is that superficial, then you don't want 'em anyhow.<br>  <br>  G'luck.|`|pBtVZ0adaa	I have a full sleeve tattoo and have no trouble meeting men. <br>  <br>  Live your life for yourself and your happiness. Not worrying about what everyone else will think of you. In the future if people treat you differently or wont accept you because you have ink on your skin than that is not the kind of people you should associate yourself with.|`|MYtn10iRaa	I myself love to see girls going big on their ink... at least half sleeve. I hate to see the poser girl with a tiny overdone tattoo (read as : trend tattoos) here and there.<br>  But if you will face any problem in your life by having that half sleeve in the future, you better not doing that sleeve hunn.. future always comes first.  <br>  <br>  PS: I love girls with big ink, but i hate to see tramp stamp.|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	Okay I'm not a guy, but in my experience guys are pretty split on the issue of sleeves on girls, some think it's amazing, others hate it (there doesn't really seem to be an in between point). This is why you just have to do what you want in life, because you'll never please everyone else, and who wants to get to their death bed having lived a restricted life? The perfect guy won't judge you either way. For what it's worth, I think half sleeves and sleeves on girls are amazing, if they're done well. I am considering turning the tattoos on one of my upper arms into a half sleeve, but in the back of my head I don't feel 100% ready to make that decision yet so I'm waiting it out. But if you're at that 100% point then go for it. And when you've reached that point, factors like the ones mentioned in the first answer won't be an issue to you - something which some non-tattooed folk probably find difficult to grasp, but I guess we can put their ignorance down to inexperience. Good luck if you go ahead - make sure you pick a fantastic artist who will do you proud!|`|2ZsRAxkuaa	I'm planning a half sleeve, and I think they're wonderful, as long as they're done well.<br>  I don't understand why people find them acceptable on men and not on women. Its weird.<br>  <br>  But yes, do what you want. Just be aware of future careers etc. But a upper half sleeve is easily coverable.<br>  <br>  And to answer above. I would be proud to have a half sleeve showing if I ever got married. Tattoos and piercings are part of who I am. All my family and friends know I'm a little odd already, who else is there to judge me? And do I really care what other people think.

ercd9ajHaa	I believe you mix equal parts color and developer (peroxide)<br>  <br>  If you use two tubes or boxes of color, use equal parts of peroxide. It's okay to eye it. Make sure you use a non-metal container, wear gloves and don't apply to damaged, brittle or heavily bleached hair.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

6YwLlYovaa	you could try threading her eyebrows. it sound's a bit scary at first, and I was nervous to try it myself, but it's really worked out great for me. it's quick, painless, easy, and effective. I can always get the perfect shape, too.<br>  it's a bit difficult to explain, and it's the kind of thing that you really want to make sure you understand before you start, so I'll just link you to the video that I used to learn how to thread eyebrows: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVmbHB2p4WM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVmbHB2p4...</a><br>  <br>  and a tutorial I found recently that I would have found helpful back when I was leaning: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F37Sl1c7BA0&feature=channel" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F37Sl1c7B...</a><br>  <br>  I know threading eyebrows sounds a little weird, but it's worked out fantastic, and there's no way i'd go back to waxing.|`|twWQwax9aa	I used to tweeze my eyebrows and the pain was ok and I thought they looked pretty good.<br>  <br>  But last week I had them threaded and wow!

It is totally worth it!<br>  <br>  I'm a wimp when it comes to pain but I survived and I am going to keep having them done that way!! I can't wax mine as it hurts so so much!<br>  <br>  xxx<br>  xx<br>  x|`|cef204e55ef21b92f83ccc265fe6d6d4aa	i think threading hurts more than plucking...<br>  <br>  numb the area with ice before plucking (with tweezers) so that it won't hurt as much|`|9avipleGaa	i know this sounds crazy but it really works its fast and it dosnt hurt one bit use a razor|`|ajgpWfMMaa	NEVER EVER shape eyebrows with a razor! It just cuts down the long part of the hair but you will still see the root of it just like stubble on a man after hes shaven, you can still see the hairs. So stubbly eyebrows? NO THANKS. Definately try threading, it hurts less and lasts longer then any waxing or plucking. It defines the brow easily and its the quickest and less painful way to shape your eyebrows. I'm a fan myself, but remember never try shaping your eyebrows yourself, leave it to the proffesionals. <br>  <br>  M xoxo|`|Uo3CFsYnaa	Some places do it professionally with a razor... Or maybe try threading.|`|bsLflc15aa	Never use Razor. Either use plucker or thread. Both are best|`|l0MiDMoYaa	use threading. it takes about a total of 10 minutes and you feel no pain at all unless its your first time|`|c0uwtsJ5aa	i guess try the razor, or tell her to buck up a little bit because almost everyone plucks or waxes their eyebrows..|`|2lqqRcMvaa	umm...try tweesers. The first time I used tweesers, it hurt really bad. But the second time, i guess i got used to it or something, but it didn't hurt at all. So my suggestion is try tweesers. Don't use a razor, they just make it come back like stubble.
GLEGh4N0aa	they work but they hurt more than waxing! it just plucks out loads of hairs at a time I'd rather wax if I was you|`|SiiMRyYQaa	Why don't you want to get waxed?<br>  <br>  Epilating is the most painful thing I have ever done. It is so much more painful than waxing. If your reason for not waxing is because people say it hurts then you most certainly don't want to use an epilator.|`|e8FiZHkRaa	Of course they work. I use one and trust me, once you use it you'll never go back to shaving. With shaving the hair grows back bristly and you have to do it about 3x a week. With epilating is rips the hair straight out from the root, the hairs grow back soft, and you only have to do it about once every two weeks. Well worth the money. Most brands are the same sort of thing but good qualtiy ones are Phillips and Braun.|`|ode2HaoIaa	Yes epilators work well, but the pain on using one may take a little while to get used to.  Suggest you exfoliate regularly if you wax or use an epilator to avoid ingrowing hair.
bVQO0BsPaa	Use bleach.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	u can|`|LxcYzV7iaa	see if they have special ones for use on the face if not wax of or something|`|PlRYgRcoaa	I wouldn't, you don't know what that crap could do to you over time, just stick to the razor.|`|GG8OPulmaa	use bleach, like "jolene".<br>  don't use hair removal because it will a) hurt, b) break into a rash and c) grow back black and stubbly and course|`|PYmdmuw8aa	Razor?|`|KhSiPUBRaa	They make hair removal creams (nail, sally hansen, ect) for your face, but I do not recommend them.  I have seen far more bad turn outs than good.  I would recommend getting the pre made wax strips, if you have tiny hairs, it's not going to hurt very much, and not for very long at all.  The reddness wil be minimal as well.  I would say to do it a night, before bed, so you can wake up to flawless skin.  And to the guy who said "that's called a beard" obviously you haven't had a woman, to know it's a part of life.|`|kNSGLgJQaa	NO<br>  read the instuctions!!<br>  <br>  pluck it if its small<br>  shave if you're willing to do so regularly and are willing to let it grow back thicker|`|5GslKD4baa	That's called a beard.<br>  And yes you can use hair removal cream on your face, just don't get it in your eyes.|`|UaBJyFhzaa	NO please dont! it will start to make your skin peel and that is very unattractive.|`|V1SABIKEaa	No, You do'nt use it, because after you will countinues using this method. so you do not take this decisition.|`|VUTvzQJ9aa	No. You will most likely burn your face.

z03u3JGXaa	If you mean, "Can I Color It Back To My Original Color?" After lightening it with SUN-IN?. The SIMPLEST answer is "YES". However, in reality getting your original color out of a box of dye is not very likely. You can get CLOSE with most shades. As for "Will It Stick?" (Stay Colored) No, it won't. It will fade - out (even with Permanent Color) after a month or two. So if you want to dye it back to your original color try one of the Demi-Permanent colors like Clairol? NATURAL INSTINCTS? Or L'Oreal? COLOR SPA? that last for 28 shampoos but DOESN'T  CHANGE your natural color as it grows-out because even with permanent color you will have to "Retouch" your hair every 6 - 8 Weeks anyway.<br>  <br>  Hope This Helps.<br>  Good-Luck!

yQdA5rHnaa	wear a wig|`|BHDXE76oaa	wig buddy its easy and wont damage ure hair|`|9H9WrHGQaa	Only a wig or bleach but will make your hair straw! No such spray exists, because only bleach will strip out color to make you pale blonde. Just go natural, or years later you will regret it, the blonde may look silly anyway! You can't just plop blonde on top, you can only strip out the black then add color, not the other way around. Blonde hair is the absence of color (melanin).|`|9FlAKRSRaa	Yeah, they have those hairsprays. It'll come off when you wash it.|`|Zk5PTmrfaa	Wear a wig...cause bleaching it will damage your hair a lot. :/|`|87Yhfk5Faa	kay did not read that novel ^^ <br>  but u can get the spray can dye thingy at shoppers|`|SFyhETp6aa	Your mum is right - bleaching dark brown or black hair can result in a mottled ginger colour, so I'd avoid that option for that reason, and that it's expensive.<br>  I don't know about spray dyes, but you could always try to find a cheap and cheerful wig which you can cut and style to your heart's content :P|`|qOVMZWMpaa	Uhm, yeah I think there MIGHT be a spray-colouring.

j7HeuFeVaa	You only notice your hair growing after you dye it because you're roots are more noticeable.<br>  Straightening or using hot appliances can damage your hair and cause breakage so the ends of your hair break off and you can't see a notice in it growing. Try blow drying your hair on a low setting to straighten it, and invest in a good conditioner.|`|B0lr4Eryaa	This could be just what you need. Run a little search on the site below.

6BhTjwoNaa	I like your new haircut. For your eyes, if you have brown eyes some eyeliner is good. Use a dark brown eyeliner on bottom lid only, halfway to the inner eye.You are lucky , you have a pretty face without makeup.So for daytime go light on the makeup. Accent your eyes by wearing a light shade on your lower lids and a few shades darker on the upper lid.Use a dark brown shade of mascara, a light blush, and light touch of lipstick or gloss.The idea is to wear a small amount so people see your eyes and not see just make up.|`|ZvKw1XDmaa	Darl, for 15 you don't need make up. If you really want to use it, stick with natural looking make up. A simple gloss will do fine, maybe a bit of mascara. If you want to wear eyeshadow, go for a medium to light brown, or a pale pink. Don't be over the top with the make up, it's supposed to be used to highlight your natural beauty, not to be a mask. When I was your age I just got a whole bunch of mates over and had a make up and hair party, it was a great way to experiment with styles, and if you screw up the application, it's a party, laugh it off, because I guarantee you someone else will do the same thing!|`|WDD6P3Zpaa	it looks like you don't need much make up.<br>  <br>  ! it depends on what kind of a look you are going for.<br>  <br>  if you want to look natural then use natural tones - look it up online on fashion magazine sites and such - they really help a lot. everything depends on your eye color<br>  <br>  but if you want like edgy and stuff - black smokey eye liner and if you have brown eyes a sapphire blue eye shadow! haha<br>  <br>  and then ALWAYS if you are feeling really bold.<br>  <br>  a red lip, with smokey eye liner and masacara.<br>  <br>  thats in style now hahaha<br>  <br>  just make sure the red suits you though.<br>  <br>  but look it up online!|`|Z6u0bakuaa	Firstly,<br>  i think youd look great with lighter hair!<br>  and you dont need make up.<br>  <br>  In terms of the kind of make up id suggest to wear tho- i think less is best. I think your complexion would really just benefit from a nice soft pale pink or nude gloss. <br>  some eye lash curling mascara, and a brush of light pink blush on the high part of your cheeks. <br>  if you were considering something edgier.. just a lil mascar on the edges of ur bottom eye. (contrary to what someone else says, its Less natural on the upperlid and tht can be quite tricky to apply.) if not done correctly, it might look messy or wonkly lol.<br>  red lipstick is a no go- i dont think it wud suit you with heavy make up.<br>  if you were doing the whole smoky eye with light specks of grey eyeshadow and some eye liner on ur bottom lid, i recommend darkening your blush to a more red tone and wearing plain ..really glossy lips.<br>  that would look kool and it would look really pretty say if u were wearing a nice lil black dress.<br>  hope that helps|`|MfKWHH4Naa	Eyeliner would be good on the top only. It looks more natural. Start thin on the inner part going wider through the middle and outer part, then make it extend slightly past your eye. It's hard to explain so I hope it makes sense. Practice makes perfect. <br>  I think darker hair would look good as long as it's only a shade darker.<br>  Have Fun!!!|`|kWE169w2aa	hey sorry i dont know how to write back to the question about vet nursing that you answered, but thankyou for doing so :)<br>  im not sure how much it costs, do you know if you have to have completed year 12?|`|885aff72c6cf3893149fe53e105ac0a0aa	at 15, you will not need foundations or blusher or anything. I would use a lipgloss, and some brown eyeliner with mascara. A little bit of colour on your eyes would be nice, just go with fashion, you're young enough to get away with anything.
Uy7lOfMzaa	False Lash Effect by Max Factor is great it really does give a false lash effect!|`|NDJORGHeaa	Clinique mascara is good, I use both the Clinique High Definition mascara and also the Clinique Lash Doubling mascara. Both of these Clinique mascaras are great and you can buy the half sizes for under ￡5 each from <a href="http://www.beautyparlor.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.beautyparlor.co.uk</a> along with other cheap cosmetics or from Ebay etc|`|T93PeFvFaa	I have 2 I love and I ave the same problem, my bottom eyelashes are tiny.<br>  <br>  I don't no who much this one was because my friend got it me for xmas but it's called Ultimate Collection and it has a gold lid and if you zig zag ut up your lashes it gives them look really long.<br>  <br>  Same with my Longer Lash, False Lash Effect Collection 2000 one. It gives you a falsh lash effect x<br>  <br>  both brilliant but remeber to zig zag them up for lash and flick them at the ends and maybe use an eyelash curler before you apply them.<br>  <br>  plus the collection 2000 one was only something like ￡2 - ￡3 x|`|8484b98b7322a891688e78db30e42f20aa	Alas, I've also been "blessed" with pretty short lashes (which especially sucks since the rest of my family has really long, thick lashes. Genetics. Grr.)<br>  <br>  Anyway, I've tried several mascaras over the years, including Revlon, Clinique, MAC, but none were as good as the one I use now (and have been using for a year or so now). I use the Artistry essentials mascara, which is bloody amazing! :D It doesn't smudge nor runs and, best of all, lasts for pretty long time, so I hardly have to reapply within a given day. Plus, the whole tube lasts pretty long too so I don't have to buy too often, which saves money.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I buy directly off their website (pasted below) rather than from the stores, since it's considerably cheaper.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps, mate! <br>  <br>  P.S. I can get you a discounted price for the mascara ($10, which is less that ￡10) if you like. Contact me via my Y!A profile page if you want. Good luck! ^_^|`|wajI2ACLaa	Bourjois Clubbers Mascara.<br>  I'm in love with it.

It makes lashes extremely long without clumps<br>  <br>  No7 'Intense Volume' mascara is also fantastic. This is good for shorter lashes too as it makes the lashes have volume with perfect separation and curl. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|pU2Oel2faa	The best mascara is Great Lash.

VSeF4mJGaa	In response to your question I would have to say yes, that would be an option, although more of a challenge for the manicurist, my wife has had a problem with biting her nails since she was very young it is a nervous habit she has yet to break, however she is reluctant to do it as often anymore due to a scientific study done on the amount of germs and bacteria found under the human nails, if you would have seen the video you would have probably thrown up to see what you are actually eating when you bite your nails, but on the plus side of having them done you might be less likely to bite them after you spend the money to get them fixed.  It would be like eating a dollar bill off each one of your fingers. Good luck in whatever route you decide to take, Peace.|`|WpxzyObkaa	yea you accualy can, i had it done|`|I3B6fvgHaa	I've done that before, but the answer is yes you can get them on, but preferably I would get gel instead of acrylic. I think its better to have little finger nails when you put them on because if their long then ur actual nail will come close to showing under the acrylic nail. hope it helps :)
ephBKMthaa	Hair won't grow any faster than it will grow.  To keep it healthly and help it grow -  don't cut it, get a 1/4" trim every 6 weeks - this will keep the ends from breaking.<br>  <br>  To be honest, it probably won't grow that much by August - so just get extensions|`|D1KT9ioJaa	put water on it everyday like a plant|`|EvKw0l6Eaa	EAT MORE CALCIUM!!

z03u3JGXaa	Even Semi-Permanent color can change your natural color with repeated applications. And if you are using a color that's several shades deeper than your natural color it can take much longer than normal to wash-out. As for Color Oops!, YES, this is the best, SAFEST and LEAST DAMAGING way to remove unwanted color - Just be sure to follow the directions carefully and be prepared to shampoo a lot and condition well afterward. As for where to buy, try the local drugstores or beauty supplies. Rite Aid, Walgreens, Target, Wal-Mart are good places to look. As for beauty supplies, ask the sales people. There are other brands of color remover(s) Jheri-Redding's ONE N' ONLY?

But if you cleanse and moisturize your skin in the morning and at night, your skin should be fine. Brands like bare escentuals, smashbox, and any other foundations that improve skin's appearance should be good for your skin. I recommend that you spend the extra money on a better foundation if you wear it every day.<br>  :)

AA12122128	What you have will likely work fairly well. Don't go overboard wanting to entirely conceal them. Work lightly with what you have and if a little of it shows don't worry with it. How and when they fade (to your liking) depends a lot on how they were treated when the event first happen. Go ahead and wear what you want and look good in. You've got a logical explanation for the scars, I doubt anyone will like you less because of them. <br>  My business partner (an attractive 37 y/o) has a one and a quarter inch scar just to the left of her left eye. Ones eye automatically goes to it when you meet her. She sees it as adding to her toughness as a woman. She injured that exact area twice in two years so the scar is rather dramatic. She and I both have burn scars on our legs from being burnt in house fires we've gone into. (She's a former Fire-Medic as i was) For us, it almost comes with the territory. <br>  Scars, of any type are from life's lessons learned that we don't usually repeat. I'm sure you feel the same way. Stay low keyed with it. Use only light covering.|`|A78bcDn9aa	well it depends if its big or little .little cuts are easy put some onitment on it and a bandade.big cuts vary if its big enuf then put a bandage like a foot bandage around it if its smaller than that then do the same you would for the little one|`|d61511600922f016b452fc8b39ab7408aa	you can usually put some aloe on them if their not to big.

NXcZ8Gkjaa	Hi Hayzz<br>  <br>  The best thing to do is get a water based moisturiser with oils like Coconut or Olive oil (stay away from mineral oils like petroleum as they lubricate and don't penetrate - door hinges need lubrication to stop squeaking - hair doesn't!) moisturise daily!<br>  <br>  Use a protein conditioner but don't leave it in overnight as protein dries hair out and makes it more brittle.<br>  <br>  When you use a protein conditioner like Cholesterol etc, leave it on your hair, put a shower cap on and either sit under a hooded dryer for 20 mins or wrap a warm towel around your head - this opens up the hair shaft and allows the strengthening protein to penetrate the hair. Do this at least once a week but try twice since your hair sounds fragile at the momement.<br>  <br>  It's best to use a shampoo with the correct PH balance so anything that says it's for dry damaged hair is fine.<br>  <br>  Try not to straighten so often and not to blow dry as these both dry out your hair.<br>  <br>  Hot oil treatments are fine so long as they're not mineral oil based.<br>  <br>  I did all of this and after six months I had no split ends and my hair was much stronger.<br>  <br>  <br>  Your hair is breaking because the dyes breakdown the structure of the hair which make it fragile and the heat treatments also weaken the hair. <br>  <br>  You may want to try clip in extensions for highlighting that way you can give your hair some tlc whilst it gets stronger.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps<br>  <br>  Chaz|`|af5283ef1b057dd3a086032b98ac13c2aa	one tip that has worked for me:<br>  <br>  don't wash your hair everyday.  if you feel you must,  "wash" it with conditioner only. i usually wash my hair once every 2-3 days and every other wash i use shampoo, every other i use only conditioner.  and when i use conditioner i leave it on for about 10 mins.   this also helps your curls stay soft.   dont blow dry, you should let it air dry (except when its cold of course!)   if you can afford it, get a product by john frieda called Frizz Eaze...   it wont reverse damage, but it will certainly help tame the frizz and give it a natural looking shine without weighing it down  i have pictures of my hair curly and straight after using these techniques.   OH YEA AND if you MUST use heat on your hair PLEASE USE CERAMIC,  it is the closest thing to natural heat.  if you are using curling and straightening irons made of aluminum (most of the cheap and old school ones are) this is aiding in the drying out of your hair.|`|RSommsOcaa	Hi from another sufferer of curly highlighted hair. I use one of the intense cream conditioners that usually come in pots such as the Aussie or L'Oreal Elvive ranges, takes a few washes but improves eventually. I also always use a conditioner for dry hair everytime I wash my hair. Make sure you get it trimmed regularly as this also helps. Best of luck.|`|uIjPLPcVaa	good shampoo and conditioner<br>  STOP using any heat products in your hair<br>  good luck|`|OsHJ9Mcqaa	Do you want to keep straightening it? Because if so, im sorry but itll just keep breaking. I have naturally dry curly hair aswell, when i was in school i used to straighten it but now im in college ive learned to embrace the curl! Its so much healthier, it doesnt break anymore and i get compliments wherever i go. <br>  <br>  if you do want to keep straightening it, the only thing you can do is go to the hairdressers religiously and get them to trim the ends away. this will prevent the ends breaking off. Also, get a deep conditioning mask, they'll help however they need to be done everyweek to ensure moisture. <br>  Also, no more highlights! the bleach strips the hair and just makes it drier. I know its hard, im having to grow the black dye out of my hair to make it stronger. <br>  <br>  I think your best bet is to go to the hairdressers and talk to them, afterall they do know what they are doing and can give you the best advice.<br>  <br>  Good luck xx|`|qSOfuEpKaa	Curly hair always needs more moisture than straight hair, and from what you describe yours is in pretty bad shape due to damage.<br>  First, get a trim. Get rid of the damaged ends if you can.<br>  Second, either try to stop straightening it, or get a heat protecting spray. The heat damage will add a lot of dryness and frizz to your hair.<br>  Third, the are things called "deep treatments." Think of them as heavy conditioners that will restore your hair! Let me explain...<br>  <br>  I have spent the last couple months researching nothing but how to improve my own curly hair. Thanks to <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/</a> I have a collection of links and explanations. I don't to deep treatments myself, but I've heard they do wonders for damaged hair.<br>  My best suggestion is to go to the site I provided, find your curl type, then post a cry for help (preferably with a picture) on the respected boards. The people there are amazing and more than willing to help.<br>  Best of luck!!|`|ode2HaoIaa	Body Shop does (or used to do) a leave in conditioner which is particularly good for dry hair.

Good luck.|`|DwakBrOiaa	hi......you should apply shehnaz mehndi for conditioning hair and plz stop using straightner it'll harm ur hair......|`|ZAvV3WfLaa	Condition it well, sleep with conditioner on your hair, it will put the oils back into it and make it less dry :]|`|d6kekKgeaa	yea! their are other people in my boat! :) go to a beauty supply store. they sell deep conditioning packets (1-2 use each) leave it in your hair for 30 mins. before washing it out. v05 oil treatments are good too, but only do them once ever two weeks to a month or your hair will end up oily. after i get outta the shower and towel dry my hair i brush it (i know it's more prone to brakage when wet, but with curly hair, their is little option) then i flip my head so my hair is hanging down (and i'm looking at my knees) then i spreed a palm full of mosse threw my hair. i scrunch my hair a little, flip it back, let it dry, then scrunch it once more to get rid of the crunchy texture - so it's all soft - . this works well for me, if i don't do this, i look like i stuck my finger in a light socket. -- hope some of this helps.

mVJdfjrmaa	A moisturiser IS a lotion - eg moisturising lotion.<br>  Do you perhaps mean what is the difference between a light lotion, and a heavier cream?<br>  <br>  If you're looking to soften rough skin on elbows, heels, toenail cuticles etc., ask the pharmacist for a product with urea in it. Any of these products is pretty inexpensive and you can really afford to slather them on and enjoy.<br>  I don't know if you have a product called Eulactol in your country? If so, that it what you should use (not on your face though, and not on broken skin). Eulactol heel balm, for example, which you can also use on elbows, has 5% urea - a magic softening ingredient!<br>  Another option is Cetomacrogol which has 10% urea in it.<br>  Otherwise if you don't have these brand names where you live, then ask your pharmacy to make up some aqueous cream with 5% - 10% urea in it. Good luck.

You then grab the two ends of the scarf and wrap them around your neck to the front on your chest.<br>  2) If you fold your scarf in half sideways, you can them wrap the scarf around your neck by grabbing the two ends of your scarf and placing then around your neck and place by your chest.<br>  <br>  I do the second option with my scarves all the time.<br>  Hope this helps, and doesn't make you more confused! :)|`|ajgpWfMMaa	ok, <br>  <br>  step 1) Open the scarf up and in a square. <br>  <br>  step 2) Fold the square in half.<br>  <br>  step 3) Hold the new triangle shaped scarf on the corners of the biggest length, so that the top of the triangle is facing down.<br>  <br>  Step 4) (In front) Place scarf corners as you are holding it on each shoulder. So that it looks like a bib.<br>  <br>  Step 5) Take the right corner and pull behind your neck and over the left shoulder.<br>  <br>  Step 6) Take the left corner and pull behind your neck and over the right shoulder.<br>  <br>  Step 7) Adjust the looseness of the scarf how you want it.<br>  <br>  And voila!

xunzkeofaa	Rub Oil in the Wound<br>  Pick up a vitamin E capsule, break it open, and let the oil ooze out over a cut or a scar. Sounds simple. Sounds effective. Lots of people do it. Some swear it helps prevent scars or even makes new scars disappear.<br>  <br>  Eat a well-balanced diet. Wounds won't heal right unless your body has what it takes to make them heal right. What does it take? Protein and vitamins—obtained by eating a good, well-balanced diet—are essential. And of particular importance to wound healing is the mineral zinc. Good sources of zinc include roasted pumpkin and sunflower seeds, Brazil nuts, Swiss and cheddar cheeses, peanuts, dark meat turkey, and lean beef.<br>  <br>  Home Remedies for Scars<br>  <br>  Application of Aloe Vera gel to the fresh wounds prevents the formation of permanent scars.<br>  <br>  The best method to treat the scars is the application of sandalwood paste with rose water. Apply paste overnight and wash the face next morning. This is a good home remedy for scars.<br>  <br>  Lemon juice is natural bleach and helps in lightening the scars of the skin.<br>  <br>  Apply essential oil of lavender on the scars with a cotton ball twice a day.<br>  <br>  The most effective home remedy for scars is application of honey several times a day. It will give a natural glow to the skin and will remove all scars.<br>  <br>  Apply cucumber juice to the scars and leave for 15 minutes and wash the face with cold water.<br>  <br>  Massaging the area with coconut oil will lighten the old scar but its complete removal is not possible.<br>  <br>  Make a paste by mixing one-tablespoon fuller's earth, one-teaspoon limejuice and rosewater. Apply this paste all over the face, massaging it gently. Leave it to dry and then apply again on the scars. Leave it for 5-10 minutes, then wash with cold water. This is one of the effective home remedies for scars.<br>  <br>  Application of olive oil is also beneficial in getting rid of any kind of scars.<br>  <br>  Vitamin E is considered best for the healthy glowing skin. Application of vitamin E oil or capsule to the scar will completely vanish the scar in few weeks.<br>  <br>  Soak a cotton ball in blanched green tea and apply this on the scar. This is a good home remedy for scars.<br>  <br>  Application of tea tree oil to the affected area will help in curing the scars<br>  <br>  Take a few mint leaves and crush them. Tie these crushed leaves in piece of muslin cloth and extract juice. Use it all over your face. It's a very good home remedy for scars..|`|X9PIqr05aa	neosporin (sp?) works for getting rid of scars<br>  i hope you can overcome this<br>  its okay im having some trouble with SI also and trying to "get better"|`|xktBgoKFaa	Bio oil works for me.

zzp1o9mlaa	Most acne medications are geared to teens' oily skin, a bad choice for drier adult skin. Effective treatment often requires a trial-and-error approach that takes time. Here are my recommendations:<br>  <br>  1. Cleansers: Cetaphil and Aquanil are the most gentle. Avoid too-strong gels and products containing beads or granules, which are abrasive and can irritate and worsen sensitive skin.<br>  <br>  2. Creams and lotions: Use an over-the-counter retinol product to clean pores and help reduce fine wrinkles. Prevent discoloration and fade acne scars with products that contain salicylic and glycolic acids. And to spot-treat a breakout, use a product with benzoyl peroxide, which helps kill bacteria.<br>  <br>  3. Prescription medications: The topical antibiotic clindamycin helps fight bacteria in the skin; so does tetracycline, another antibiotic, taken orally. Oral contraceptives and spironolactone, a blood pressure drug, can help balance hormones.<br>  <br>  4. High-tech solutions: Laser and intense pulsed light treatments mainly target scars, but blue light therapy treatments kill acne-causing bacteria. These treatments are costly, though, so explore your other options first.<br>  <br>  Please let me know if any of this information was helpful! :)|`|QeEHsyTNaa	well wash it daly with like clean and clear and try not to put conclearre aor anything but neava on your skin and i promise that your skin will look better|`|XnqS5uu6aa	Just take a shower.

You don't need much, just a couple of spoonfuls, but make sure work it through the hair and over the scalp.<br>  <br>  While it's still warm and on your  head, wrap something around your head like tin foil to keep the oil warm, then wrap your head with a towel. <br>  <br>  When you go to wash it, rinse out as much of the oil as you can first, then apply the shampoo and let this sit in the hair for a few minutes. <br>  <br>  Your hair should be nice and glossy afterwards.|`|d8jH5lU1aa	I heard that it's really hard tacking it away from your hair it gets really really oily...........but I haven't tried it=]|`|KH9HROrSaa	yeah it makes a great deep conditioner.<br>  olive oil naturally has a lot of moisturizing properties.<br>  <br>  the should be room temperature.<br>  massage a few table spoons of olive oil into your hair, use enough to coat your hair.<br>  cover with a shower cap.<br>  leave it on for at least an hour, you can even leave it in over night.<br>  shampoo it until it feels clean.<br>  no need to condition|`|11a1ca6e5344b05fcc0a1be08c886a49aa	always listen to your hairdresser <-- good advice right there lol<br>  <br>  olive oil is very good for your hair its good for your split ends, and it heals your weak hair to make it stronger. dont believe me?? ask miranda cosgrove she uses it for her hair too =]|`|NBNBKWchaa	Yes it does your hair good it should be heated but not to hot or it will burn<br>  It puts natural oils back into dry hair<br>  You only have to leave it in for 5/10 mins not 2 hours|`|bF3DAb1faa	your hairdresser dances naked in he woods with chickens at night|`|UH4lU7MEaa	olive oil make thehair soft, strong and manageable. <br>  <br>  follow these steps<br>  <br>  <br>  # Warm about 2 tsps. of olive oil. Test the oil's temperature before applying it to your scalp; the oil should be warm to the touch, but not scalding. Warm oil penetrates more deeply into the hair shaft to repair the damaged cuticles that cause dryness, frizziness and breakage.<br>  <br>  # Massage the oil into your hair, beginning with your scalp and working your way to the ends of your hair. Be gentle with your hair; rough treatment causes breakages that can increase frizz and flyaways.<br>  <br>  # Wrap your hair in a warm towel and let the oil saturate your hair for up to 30 minutes. Sitting in a steamy bath can increase the oil's penetration of the hair shaft (resulting in deeper conditioning) and can also prevent messy oil spills around the house.<br>  <br>  # Wash your hair with a mild shampoo at the conclusion of this treatment and rinse your hair thoroughly. As you rinse, use cool water, which seals the hair shaft, locking in shine and preventing damaged ends.|`|k4EtI2Avaa	Yes, olive oil is very good for hair. Your hairdresser was right. I have done this before, just make sure you shampoo and condition(preferably a nicely scented shampoo and conditioner) properly to get the scent out. The oil does not need to be heated to work, but you could try warming it. It gets your hair soft and silky and strengthens it. :)|`|w3Qq3L3saa	sounds like a good idea what are you trying to treat? tangles breakage?

tzfKhULYaa	No, it's not "bad" to straighten your hair, but it's not necessarily good, either. Straightening your hair every day can make it become brittle from too much heat friction, but it's not going to make you go bald.<br>  <br>  If you're worried about damaging your hair, you should use Tresemme Heat Protection Spray. It's absolutely AMAZING-- I've used it every day since last summer, and it has honestly made my hair softer and shinier. It's inexpensive, and you can buy it in any store that carries hair products.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tresemme.com/heat/products/heat-tamer-protective-spray.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.tresemme.com/heat/products/he...</a><br>  <br>  Another product you should try is BedHead Control Freak straightening serum. Since you have naturally curly hair, this is great, because it keeps your hair super-straight, while also smoothing out frizzies.

Instead of straightening it everyday, you could just spray on some hair spray to your curly hair and comb it through to stop the frizz, and getting some mousse to pump up your curls so they look nice instead of the ones you hate.

vrImLiv0aa	It's best to see a doctor if your face has too many acne scars. If the scars aren't big or deep however, consider treating the scars in your home using natural treatments,<br>  Drink lots of water,<br>  Eat fruits and vegetable<br>  Load up on lemon juice,<br>  Maintain a balanced and nutritious diet,<br>  Try rosehip seed oil,<br>  Apply Aloe vera gel or juice<br>  Treat your scars with tomato,<br>  Heal them with olive oil<br>  Use honey,<br>  Lather with lavender oil,<br>  Rose water and sandalwood<br>  <br>  Rub them with ice cubes, Lots of people use ice cubes to get rid of their acne scars at home. Wrap an ice cube in a piece of cloth and rub it on affected areas for 10 to 15 minutes every day. This should lessen the inflammation on your skin, making it look smoother.<br>  <br>  Make your own face mask: Mix one tablespoon of sour cream with one tablespoon of oatmeal and yogurt, then add a few drops of lemon juice. Apply the mixture on your acne scars and leave it there for about 10 minutes. Thoroughly rinse it off and pat it dry.<br>  <br>  Multani Mitti paste: Mix some garlic cloves, carrot juice, honey and Multani Mitti powder and turn the mixture into a paste. Apply it on your acne scars for 20 minutes every day to reduce the redness and swelling. You may combine this home remedy together with other natural treatments to get rid of the scars faster.<br>  <br>  The best way to avoid acne and acne scars is to eat a healthy diet and live an active, healthy lifestyle. Exercise regularly to reduce stress and get rid of toxins in your body that make acne and acne scars worse. Don't lose your patience when applying natural home remedies to your acne scars because they may take a while to show improvements. Consult your doctor if the treatments don't seem to work or if your scars are getting worse.<br>  <br>  I know how your feeling as i was exactly the same. heres a few thing you can try above^^^<br>  Ive done several of these an they do help!!!|`|CEkJIFGZaa	DONT try stuff you read on the internet.

Anything with added vitamin e, or aloe is really good for the skin. Even polyspron helps get rid of the appearance of scars. You can even buy the vitamin e capsules, get a pin, and poke the pill. Then you can squeeze the capsule, and get a bunch of pure vitamin e that you can put directly on your face. It's a little messy, but leave it on for 10 mins and then wash to your face. I used it or cuts and scraps adn they healed up right away.|`|Bc7OVWKeaa	not a big deal.|`|tY4hOjqdaa	See a local skin adn vein center or cosmetic surgeon/skin care center type operation. They will have some products that will be helpful and also if you have scarring can go over the option's available as well as cost and payment plans they may have. Moreover, not knowing what ur age is, you may have a hormone imbalance. You should see ur physician about checking this out as well. My ex had issues with the same thing ur going through into her 30's. So I would make sure there is no issue there or see if there is something supplemental or if on birth control u may opt out of that for another type to minimize the effects of hormones and skin breakouts.

Try to explain to her that it is just a way of expressing yourself and looking good, and that blue hair does NOT always lead to tattoos, facial piercings, and alternative lifestyles.

AA11090858	How long ago did you have it done?<br>  <br>  Assuming that this is a reasonably new piercing (within the last month or so), it sounds to me like it could be one of two things:<br>  <br>  a) the beginning of an infection (if the discharge is a whitish colour, and sticky), <br>  <br>  or <br>  <br>  b) it could just be trying to heal, and the 'fatty looking stuff' could just be the fresh "crusties" forming (lymphatic fluid). This should be clear, and then turn a yellowish colour as it dries. <br>  <br>  <br>  If you're not sure, you should go back and see your piercer. He or she should be able to tell you straight away what is going on with it, and what to do about it. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|qeNrGoMsaa	See your Doctor, He can look at it and tell you right away whether it's what, and maybe fix it in the office.|`|V1FuXBYraa	Have your piercer look at it.<br>  In the meantime, clean well with seasalt water

jER0X5OPaa	To get the flat stomach, you need to do crunches. Google crunches and you should get a variety to do. Also, if you have a layer of fat over your stomach, you will need to do cardio and eat healthy to lose that fat, because crunches alone will not get it to go away. Crunches just build muscle and tone. <br>  <br>  As for the no lines, I've heard cocoa butter works, but I don't know for sure about that.|`|9J2e43ECaa	iv d same problem!!:(!! <br>  i have no solution(yet) but a really helpful tip is to have good posture!<br>  sit up, back straight, shoulders pushed back and chest out!<br>  no joke, this works a treat!:P
