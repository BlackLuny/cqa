3QKsFMbYaa	my friend got a free ipod nano from one of these sites. it wasn't xpango but another.<br>  <br>  the principle of it makes sense. you join the site and then you choose from a  list of offers to try. things like free trials of blockbuster online, or just all different things, but most are free trials. so you sign up to try a couple of these services and the company (meaning blockbuster, or whoever) pays the "free stuff" site for getting you to try them. so they are making a profit even after giving you a gift.<br>  <br>  some sites require that you refer a certian number of friends in order to get your free gift, but the site i'm doing lets you do it all yourself. i started a couple days ago and i'm going to keep track of my progress on a blog i started: <a href="http://freestuffadventures.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">http://freestuffadventures.wordpress.com</a>|`|PIdZk7z4aa	It is true, I know at least 5 people who have got really nice stuff.

PbNPhRVMaa	+<br>  -Probably one of the best Web browsing experience you can get with a prepaid phone<br>  -Check your myspace on the go! ^_^<br>  -Embeded with AIM so you can keep up with your friends on the go.<br>  -Qwerty keypad makes texting, web browsing, and IMing A LOT easier.<br>  -An above average quality camera<br>  -Games can be played at faster speeds compared to other Virgin phones.<br>  -Sleek black and silver look with illuminating blue keypads.<br>  -Small, comfertable and not as bulky as the Sidekick II.<br>  -makes a cool bleeping sound when you flip the phone up and down.<br>  -pretty cool tools such as Stopwatch, Calender, Calculator, ....even a friggin flashlight that uses the camera's LED flash lol. (trust me..it came in handy!)<br>  <br>  <br>  -<br>  <br>  -The keypad is pretty small so you may have to look a lot when you type and use your fingernails somtimes.<br>  <br>  -When AIM has not been used in a couple hours or so and you get an IM from sombody; AIM will automaticly log you out causing you to loose the IM you recieved. which can REALLY be a pain in the ***.<br>  <br>  -For some wierd reason, it loads not even HALF of your buddy list......<br>  <br>  -Though this may have one of the best web browsing on a prepaid phone, its still not perfect. Some sites may become pretty jumbled up or have you do a lot of scrolling to get to where you want (if its a large page such as sombody's profile with a lot of stuff in it). but it doesn't cause too much of a nuesance.<br>  <br>  - Just like any other Virgin phone; If you plan on going out into the boonies, forget it. You would catch hell trying to get a signal.<br>  <br>  -The battery life has a lifespan of a housefly. MAKE SURE you charge this phone up everynight or everytime it isn't in use. Because the battery can go out in a days time (if you use it to surf the web or text or IM).<br>  <br>  -Phone feels kind of wierd talking through since its a little bulky from the front.<br>  <br>  <br>  -THE FRIGGIN KEYGUARD!!..which is about useless! This is my BIGGEST complaint about the phone!<br>  You may put it on when you stick in your pocket thinking it'll be safe. but once you start doing a lot of moving, the button combonation could still be unlocked causing you to accidently push all of your buttons and messing things up..like making calls to bogus numbers like: 456-353265-6363-@$%365. or making a new contact (I have about 3 contacts accidently made!). I hope they can find a better feature to prevent this. maybe a REAL hold switch like what the Ipod has or the PSP.<br>  <br>  -If you use this as a "Myspace-2-Go" kinda thing, just remeber that you can't reply or send messeges or anything with it. For some wierd reason when you submit your messege or comment, it takes you to the Myspace search page (I guess the search button's links get caught up with the submit ones). I hope that gets fixed though.<br>  <br>  -I wish the camera flash was stronger though.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Conclusion: All in all this is a very good phone that does have its flaws. Its really addicting texting, surfing the web and checking your myspace, Iming your buddies and what not. It has the great virgin phone services included too and if you sign up from today till june 9th you'll get AIM for free for a month (then you gotta pay $3.99 a month after that).<br>  So in conclusion, if you're looking for a good Sidekick II alternative and don't want to dish out over $250 and mess around with contracts, then this phone is DEFINATLY for you! I always wanted a phone that has the features as the Sidekick but cheaper, and here it is. Even though it does has it flaws, you still won't be completly disapointed in it! :)<br>  <br>  8.5/10|`|wPyAT3auaa	It is nice for text messaging that is really about all. The phone is to small for most people to talk on like a regular cell phone. The screens go bad on them and have to be repaired nor do they hold charge very well. You have to keep the keypad locked on them if you plan on carrying them in your pocket or purse so you don't dial random numbers. They cannot hold very much music or photos nor can you receive or send music and photos through the blue-tooth to or from the phone because of the level of blue-tooth it has. Overall there are more cons. It really depends on how much texting you do. I have one but I only use it for texting and on the web. I have a work cell phone that I use to talk on so this works out great for me. Hope this is of some help. Good luck!
fobdeFiqaa	It is awful. Your call drops every 10 minutes. No you cannot use it out of town and texting is an extra $3 a month which is not bad. Their best phone is the Motorola L7c SLVR . It's nice, sleek, and cute but Metro PCS sucks. Go with T-Mobile. With a new activation you can get a NICe free phone! :)|`|AA11454143	Metro PCS is a prepaid phone company, with some of the lowest prices available on service, but with a bit of compromise to quality.<br>  As a general rule, you are getting what you paid for. Most customers recieve general-quality service, but you may need to have your services troubleshooted by cutomer service (e.g. calling to have picture messaging services refreshed when they don't work, needing to have your phone programmed because you are receiving weak service, etc) but can be quickly fixed provided that your first call is not made from the handset; they'll refresh your features, walk you through reprogramming, and 9/10 times it fixes the problem immediately, and should all take less than ten minutes.<br>  <br>  However, the roaming options suck. You can use your phone unlimited within your calling area, but TravelTalk (the roaming feature) is .49 or .79 depending on where you travel. Also, the charges are not added to your bill, but rather paid by you placing money in a MetroConnect account, which is like a prepaid spending account, and nonrefundable (which is inconvenient if you put in more than you actually end up using), though you can use that money later to buy games, ringtone, wallpapers, etc for your phone.<br>  <br>  Text messaging is included in most plans, but seperately is $3/mo.<br>  <br>  The best phones, in terms of durability, price, and capabilities seem to be Nokia. If you're looking for a more gadget-y phone, the Moto SLVR is a good choice, and supports every feature Metro has, and is the one model that they ALWAYS make compatible with new features. Also, the Kyocera K312 is a really good phone that can do it all.<br>  <br>  If you want a really expensive phone, it is better to get a refurbished one and tough out the reactivation costs ($15 + the first month's bill up front) rather than buy a new one and get the first month free. Really, the only advantage, other than the free first month, to a new phone is the ability to add insurance, which is really a rip off anyway. All refurbed phones are required to be damage-free and function as well as a new phone.<br>  <br>  If you are interested in MetroPCS, your best bet is to find a MetroPCS corporate store in your area and get their opinion on what the best phone/plan is for you. They can show you all the models, and give you the best information on the services. However, most corporate stores don't have used phones, and therefore you have to pay full price for a new one - skip buying from teh corp store, and buy from authorized dealer. But don't go to them for advice, they'll try to swindle you just to further their own commission.<br>  <br>  If you have problems with your phone, want to change your features, or want to switch to a different phone, never go to the store, they charge for these things. You can do it all at no cost to you by dialing *228 from a Metro phone, or by calling 1-888-8metro8.|`|ZDy421fZaa	HI I actually work for Metro Pcs, and Im also a Verizon agent. But concerning your question....Metro Pcs is still considered a new company(about 5 years old) their coverage area is limited(compared to its bigger national rivals) but is expanding!! When you get set up with Metro Pcs you automaticxally get set up with TRAVEL TALK(free) this works just like a pre paid service, your phone knows when its outside of your coverage area, to be able to use it you must pre pay(no hidden charges at the end of the month) the phone will deduct anywhere from 49 to 79 cents a minute from the money you Pre Paid. everything in Metro Pcs is unlimited. If you want texting you must sign up with a text capapble service(the $40,$45, or $50 plan) each one having its own features. There is no contract,no activation fee,no credit check. as mentioned the Motorola Sliver is a great phone but its mainly for music enthusiasts. There are other less expensive phones with the same qualities. Motorola V323i,and the Samsung a870. Hope this helped.

Best option.<br>  <br>  If you are using one computer then just use the same iTunes.<br>  <br>  If you are using two computers then you need to download iTunes on the other computer and take the songs off your iTunes and put them on CD-Rs.

AA10923128	It depends on what you are looking for.  The Wing is a windows mobile device so you can do a lot, lot more with it.  It would do just about anything you can do with the sidekick but you'd have other features like ability to work over wi-fi.<br>  <br>  Yes, it would work with flash and java.<br>  <br>  The problem becomes that you have to do a lot of that kind of stuff yourself, just like your computer if there is something that didn't come pre-installed you'd have to install it yourself and then try and fix it if it didn't work.<br>  <br>  The sidekick would be much more simple.  Even though you'd be able to do much less.

vjuSBst9aa	Are you sure it isn't on "Shuffle". If not, your mp3 must be a HDD - which stands for Hard Disk Drive. These type of MP3 players usually have more storage capabilities but skip songs when moved around a lot. If you wish to have an MP3 player which doesn't skip songs while playing and moving I will suggest you would buy a PSS - Portable Solid State. These Mp3 player's however, tend to have smaller storage space than HDD's. They can be a variety of reasons why your MP3 player is skipping songs.<br>  <br>  In some other cases, the actual .mp3 files can be corrupt which may cause the mp3 player to automatically skip them to prevent damage. Or maybe you dropped it in water or on hard floor - there can be many possibilities why it is acting that way. <br>  <br>  Try visiting the manufacture or your local warehouse or where you bought it from.|`|d2597051e4bec78674296e7cbe523758aa	You may need to bring it back to the store you bought it from, or send it in to the company.

Dgr5Otkwaa	They are secret because the name of the achievement, or the description of how to get it, may spoil some plotline of the game.<br>  <br>  For example, if during a particular game your partner (let's call him "Duane") ultimately becomes your enemy and you are required to kill him.  Having an achievement called "Killed Duane" on the list for you to read at the start of the game would be a bit silly.<br>  <br>  Other reasons are things like the PGR4 secret achievements, where they aren't spoilers, but puzzles that you figure out in order to get the achievement.  By having a description of the achievement that tells you how to get it would ruin the puzzle.<br>  <br>  Dave<br>  P.S. I agree sometimes is can be frustrating not knowing how to get an achievement, but at least there is logic there.|`|KSxzoYNraa	they want to make it a surprise for u and u well be like, cool i dint know that that was going to happen.  and so that u just dont try to get that achievement easily.|`|AA11289037	Just means you dont know what they are until you get them.

All 360s can go online, and play games online if you have a Xbox Gold Subscription ($50/year.)<br>  <br>  The 3 models are currently:<br>  <br>  Arcade:  No hard drive, comes with a 256MB memory card.<br>  <br>  Pro: 60GB hard drive, also comes with a headset and component video cable.<br>  <br>  Elite: 120GB hard drive, headset, component video cable, HDMI cable.  The elite is also painted black and comes with a black controller.<br>  <br>  Although the Pro is $100 more than the Arcade, the addition of the hard drive, headset and component video cable would cost more if you purchased them separately.  The hard drive is required if you want to download demos, as well as play some games online, like Burnout Paradise.  Many games also feature additional content you can download, but won't fit on the memory card.<br>  <br>  I can only recommend the Elite if you think you're going to be downloading a lot of TV shows or movies from the Xbox Network.  Otherwise the 60GB hard drive of the Pro should be plenty.|`|Dgr5Otkwaa	ALL current retail Xbox 360s support up to 1080p, and ALL current retail Xbox 360s have an HDMI port on them.<br>  <br>  The only difference between them is the storage you get with them (either a memory card with the Arcade, a 60Gb Hard Drive with the Pro, and a 120Gb Hard Drive with the elite).  Aside from that, they are all identical performance-wise.<br>  <br>  The only other differences will be what's included in the box (free software, arcade games, etc), and of course the Elite console is black.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps,<br>  Dave<br>  <br>  Oh, also, for backwards compatibility you need a console wih a Hard Drive, so either the Pro or Elite.  Or of course you can still get an Arcade version, and buy a separate hard drive later, same difference.|`|qxEUqAB8aa	if you want incredible picture quality then go elite.  its worth it if you have the money, and besides they just dropped in price not to long ago.  If you don't have the money the pro just dropped in price as well and the picture quality is still amazing.  I've seen both and honestly it depends on whether or not 100 more gbs and the 1080p is worth the 100 dollar difference.  I say it is but that for you to deside.  hope this helps.|`|EW7kRrWxaa	well no   look here <br>  <br>  hget 60gb far enough space ok  take the av cables out   sell them at gamestop or ebay w/e u cna at least get 15 iam just guessing ok on that  then buy the hdmi cables they sell for 40-50 bucks there u go   u got the same cables as elite. its not the type of xbox push the poweer its the cables you have <br>  <br>  even if u stick with the cables comes with the 60gb its sstill hd ready <br>  <br>  all you do dont get the arcade <br>  <br>  the only thing with elite is 60gb is blk sysztem vs white 60gb vs 120gb and hdmi cables comes with the elite

vtyLtMjgaa	Honestly, I would stick with the sk3, especially since I've had the sk3 and am now using the LG Voyager. The voyager only comes with MOBILE aim, therefore its not as instant as the sk3's. Compared to the sk's aim, the voyager takes about like 5-7 seconds just to send one message, and you can only use about 130 or 127 character. Also the voyager isnt a multifunction phone, meaning you can't multi-task with it. For example if you wanted to listen to music, you wouldn't be able to do anything else at the same time. Although the internet is much faster on the voyager than the sk3, i would still stick with the sk.|`|fee09b5e3d149771de1ec09bd9c174d0aa	This might not be much help, but go into a store (an actual Verizon Wireless store, not an authorized agent) and ask if they can show you on the demo phone.

c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	Batteries should charge when camera is on or off.  Check your camera manual, but most cameras will blink red light while charging and go steady red or green when charge is complete.  <br>  <br>  It is best for most batteries to use a full cycle charge monthly by using battery until camera indicates battery needs charging.   If your camera uses NiMH batteries, consider buying a good charger.<br>  <br>  The secret to making digital cameras work better is having good electrical contacts between batteries and camera.<br>  <br>  CAUTION   Do not overcharge!  Batteries can be severely damaged.  Use an automatic two or more hour Energizer Compact smart charger with safety timer, temperature monitor, and trickle charge technology ($9.76) at Walmart.  For longer life, use Duracell 2000 mAh and a full cycle charge monthly.  To preserve battery charge, use the view finder and not the LCD screen when possible.<br>  <br>  Check the source link for other camera tips and help with making digital cameras work better.<br>  |`|j5Apt8hWaa	First there are two different type Sanyo P&S cameras ... ones that  use NiMH AA  and those that use Li-ion rechargeable batteries.  Depending upon which you have they are charged differently.<br>  <br>  Li-ion batteries are charged with the charger that came with your camera.  NiMH AA's are recharged with a charger you bought with the batteries.<br>  <br>  In both cases you leave the batteries in the charger until either the light stops blinking and stays on, goes out or turns green.  Each charger is a little different, so you will have to refer to your owners manual

JU5oObnpaa	Your PS3 cannot pass the undecoded bitstream to the receiver. It decodes the Dolby True sound track and passes it as LPCM over HDMI. You do not need HD Decoders in the receiver, but if you are buying something new, then most good ones will have it anyway.<br>  <br>  The PS3 will decode everything that's out there (ie: DTS MA HD and Dolby True) and pass it as LPCM.<br>  <br>  I notice a huge difference in the quality of audio coming from the surrounds and subwoofer. A little from the fronts and center but not as much. Dolby Digital needed compression to fit on the disk, so rather than sacrafice the front three channels a lot of movies would tone down what was on the surround channels. It all depends on the movie too. Some Blurays are better than other, same with DVDs.
AkL6cUV1aa	I agree.  Denon's sound is just fuller and more transparent.

If your receiver supports Dolby TrueHD, then you can be happy that you're getting the best quality sound that the home theatre market is currently offering.  <br>  <br>  Honestly though? I don't think many home users will receivers costing consumer prices, and speakers to match will notice any improvement in sound.<br>  <br>  So if your receiver doesn't process HDMI audio, or Dolby TrueHD, stick with your optical cable.  It's plenty good enough.<br>  <br>  Dave|`|e79a89e997a2cbaab7d6ae8314e6538faa	Double D is correct except one thing: PS3 bitstreams and decodes all codecs.<br>  <br>  You should use an HDMI cable to a receiver that will accept HDMI audio.

Dgr5Otkwaa	Hiya, Congrats on your new telly purchase.  Being a 37" I'm guessing it's a plasma screen (my personal fave).<br>  <br>  Anyway, the connection you are currently using is called component video.  It seems that you may have things wired slightly wrong, so we'd best check this out.<br>  <br>  This is going to be a long answer, but please bear with me!<br>  <br>  Component video uses 3 plugs for video (red, green, and blue).  There is an older (non-HD) connection called composite video which is the yellow connector.  If you are currently using the yellow connector, take it out.  You DO NOT want to have the yellow connector plugged in.<br>  <br>  On that same cable, you'll also find (next to the yellow connector) a red and white connector.  This is your stereo audio.  Note that the component video connectors also have a red connector, be sure not to muddle these up, it won't break anything if you get it wrong, you just won't get any picture.  You can tell them apart because the audio red connector, will be near the white one.<br>  <br>  So you should have plugged into your TV: red, green, blue and also red and white, with the yellow connector just dangling not plugged into anything.  Then on the cable where it connects to your Xbox, make sure you slide the switch so it points to HDTV instead of TV.  This will tell your Xbox to output High Definition video via the component video connections.<br>  <br>  Turn on your system, select the right input on your TV that corresponds to the component video input, and hopefully you'll see a picture.  On the Xbox dashboard now, go all the way to the right hand 'Settings' blade, choose 'console settings', then 'display', then 'HDTV Settings'.  In there you'll be able to change the resolution of the Xbox.  I recommend selecting the highest number that will work with your TV.  This will probably be 1080i.  If you're lucky, 1080p will work, but most likley it won't.<br>  <br>  As for the 60Hz thing, you Xbox will detect whether your TV supports higher Hz rates, and set that for you.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, if I've confused you, or if anything I said didn't work, please please email me, I've done this a hundred times.<br>  <br>  Dave<br>  <br>  P.S. I'm guessing that perhaps your Xbox doesn't have an HDMI port on it.  If it does, then perhaps you'd be better off using HDMI, it's easier to connect up, and arguably better quality.  Again, if you're not sure about this, just send me an email and we can discuss it.|`|3a671a7fc22386bc37b64483d80da9a6aa	Basically, you have the best option. Getting a HDMI cable will not improve the picture visibly, so you can save the money.<br>  <br>  You leave the yellow plug dangling disconnected. You only connect the 3 wires on one end of the cable (blue, green and red for component video) and red and white from the other end for stereo audio.<br>  <br>  Make sure, you put the switch on the broad plug on the console to HDTV.<br>  <br>  Then set the screen resolution to 720p.<br>  <br>  This is the best picture quality there is.<br>  <br>  Other cables will have other drawbacks:<br>  A HDMI or a VGA cable will cost you money, but won't improve the graphical quality of games.<br>  However, with a VGA or HDMI cable the playback of DVD movies will be upscaled.<br>  <br>  On the other hand: If you are in a PAL country or want to watch 50Hz movie content, the video will not play, as most TV's aren't able to do 50Hz on VGA.|`|EW7kRrWxaa	u aready geting omost but go head spend 50 bucks for hdmi  cabmes but first make sure you have hdmi ports where the av coird goes  if its like a sqeaur trhen you dont but if the sides are at angle  going down   then you do if you go google and type in xbox 360 hdmi port and go pictures u can see <br>  <br>  thats if your tv can support 1080p|`|pgyEmd2naa	HD cables|`|y6b5jyQaaa	What kind of TV?  LCD, DLP, etc?  Reason it matters is because example, LCD adds lag, same as projectors etc.<br>  <br>  Want to make sure you have a fast monitor.  Add in 1080p and it could add additional fractional m/s lag if your a big FPS player. (Now add internet lag and life begins to suck even more)  Great for movie, and animated sequence's but not always the best for gaming.<br>  <br>  Trial and error kind of deal, just a fyi.  If your not a big multi player online shooter player then don't worry about it. <br>  <br>  Getting the hdmi cable is a smart bet, hit ebay and find one dirt cheap for that will give you the best output over component video.|`|DY8YYluqaa	Get the special HD cable.. that plugs into a different port on the xbox (next to the normal one) Its the HDMI port... this will offer the best picture quality.<br>  <br>  HD cables cost about ￡15 - ￡20|`|wIM3vNtwaa	1) System Blade<br>  2) Display (may be in console settings)<br>  3) Set it to HD and choose 1080i or 720p<br>  <br>  Then on the cable change the switch to HD (after shutting off your 360. You find this at the end of the cable that plugs into your XBOX and goes to your TV (on the XBOX's end))
AA11268819	A Sony or a Sharp are your better choices.|`|ikXRqWxUaa	sony, sharp, samsung (they don't make 42 inch, only 40 or 46), or LG.  the sony will cost you the most though, by far.  any of these brands though would work great for gaming.  i personally have a sharp and a samsung and i'm very happy with them both.|`|Dgr5Otkwaa	Lol, those are your only requirements? That's a pretty narrow search IMO!<br>  <br>  OK, so first off, there aren't _that_ many 42" LCD TVs around.  Most LCDs are either 40" or 46", so if you want 42", you're probably going to get a plasma instead of LCD.  Which is fine by me, I personally prefer plasmas, but plenty of people disagree.<br>  <br>  You haven't actually asked, so only read this if you're interested: Plasmas tend to have darker blacks, and deeper colours than LCDs, all plasmas 'respond' to a video signal faster than any LCD which makes them particularly good for gaming and fast action movies.  Having said that, all plasmas are susceptible to screen burn (so don't leave a game/movie on pause overnight), and 1080p plasmas are harder to make (therefore are less common, and perhaps more pricey).<br>  <br>  IMO, the best plasma manufacturer is probably Pioneer, but they don't have a 42" 1080p.  I can heartily recommend Panasonic however who also have exceptional image quality, and have a range of 42" 1080p plasma sets.  The following Panny sets match your criteria:<br>  TH-42PZ81B<br>  TH-42PZ85B<br>  TH-42PZ800B<br>  TH-42PZ80B<br>  <br>  They are all very much similar, with some minor tweaks to the graphical engine in some of them, and one has a Freesat HD tuner built in.<br>  <br>  These are all superb TVs and I can guarantee you will never feel regret if you buy any of them.  If you fancy, check out the following site:<br>  <a href="http://www.hdtvtest.co.uk/news/panasonic-th42pz80b-review-20080514109.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hdtvtest.co.uk/news/panasonic...</a><br>  <br>  That links straight to a review of one of those TVs, they are totally impartial, and incredibly knowledgeable.<br>  <br>  Hope that all helps<br>  Dave|`|EwtGmpquaa	I really recommend a Samsung. You can get a Samsung A530 which has all the necessary requiremenst you need...Is also 1080P, all Samsungs 40" and above in the 08 models are all 1080P, so nothing to worry about! <br>  <br>  -3x HDMI. (1 side, 2 rear.)<br>  -2x Compoment. ( Rear.) <br>  -AV Inputs (Side/Rear.)<br>  -PC Input<br>  -1080P Resolution<br>  -Swivel Effect...Which NO OTHER BRAND HAS!!!<br>  -Tru Surround XT Quality.<br>  -Each model will come with a little somthing different, but each model 40" and above comes with all the specs listed above...I may miss a couple, but thats basically the good stuff :)!<br>  <br>  Which has a 20,000 Dynamic Contrast Ratio, which will blow any other brand completely out of the water!!! Samsung is # 1 rated for the Highest Dynamic Contrast Ratios in the LCD business!<br>  <br>  Higher the contrast more shading of blacks and whites you get across the panel, so image that? A really really high contrast ratio, for your gaming would make your games look about crystal clear...With the great shading, texture detail, vividness.<br>  <br>  If you get a Sony or a Sharp...Dont get me wrong, they are great tv's...You are going to pay about an extra $100-$300. Just for the name itself, espcially a Sony product...In my opinion, and what I tell customers at work, when I am selling them a T.V...Sony's are basically only good when it comes to movies, Sharps are best when it comes to watching Baseball...Samsungs are almost best for anything, espcially gaming! <br>  <br>  Also since your into gaming, Samsung is the best choice for you!!! Samsung has a gaming mode inside their television, basically they teamed up with Bill Gates/Microsoft, when your playing video games on their televisions, it will blow any other brand out of the water!<br>  <br>  Also Samsung uses type Grade "A" panels on all there televisons, with regular "Matt finish" if you get in the A650 and above, you will get extra features such as the 120Hz processor, which will make your gaming run a lot smoother, basically double the frame rate...And you will get about 3x's the contrast ratio's as well...A650 has about 50,000 Dynamic...Also you get "Super Matt Finish" panels, which are basically their top of the line panels.<br>  <br>  You can get a Samsung A530, for about 1099.99 right now...I take advantage of it, when this one first game out it was 1199.99<br>  <br>  Be honest I get the Samsung, there is other models out there at the moment like the A550, A650, A750, A850, A540 (plasma.) And many more...But the A530 is the best for the money.<br>  <br>  Your name brands, except in Plasmas, only make 40", but to be honest...2 inches isn't going to make a huge difference...Only brands that make 42" in the LCD business, are basically the crap brands, like Vizio, Proscan, Westinghouse, Olevia, etc...These brands tend to have malfunctions and have BAD!!! Picture quality....Your better off in a 40".<br>  <br>  Your best to sticking with an LCD...Plasma tv's are great and everything, but since your into movies and gaming, the Samsungs LCD panels are great for that, because they have about 4-6 second, milli-second response time ratios, which basically helps prevent the burn in by about 10 fold...I dont recommend the plasma, because with movies and gaming, you are going to have images on the panel for long extended periods of time, which will increase the chances of the image taking an imprint to the panel, and staying their because pixels on the plasma's panels tend to move a lot slower than they do on the LCD panels, so you could possibly get the "Burn-in effect".<br>  <br>  I myself have a Samsung and I haven't regretted buying it yet, I use it for video games occasionally, and oh my goodness it looks amazing, so bright, so vivid, so crisp...And the audio quality from the Tru Surround XT speakers, oh my goodness makes it sound like im right their.<br>  <br>  Model I have is Samsung LNT3253H...Its the last years model, so it can't be bought anymore at local retailers.<br>  <br>  Enjoy!

Dgr5Otkwaa	OK you have to be careful with this.<br>  <br>  The answer is, that if your device can be set to output a component video signal over the scart connection, then YES, you will get a better quality signal.<br>  <br>  BUT, if your device cannot be set to output component over the scart connection, then you will get NO image at all.  Plenty of DVD players won't do this, and infact that ebay auction even states that it's designed for high-end DVD players.<br>  <br>  The previous answerer was assuming that you were expecting the cable to work some magic between the 2 devices, which is clearly not going to happen. <br>  <br>  I suggest you look in your DVD players settings menu and see if you can find something about Component Video over Scart.<br>  <br>  Dave|`|UB4iInd7aa	no, it would make no difference. By plugging a scart into you dvd player/cable box you are still only getting a scart quality signal to start with. Simply buying a cable adapter to fit the component input on your tv would not improve the signal along the way. The only way to improve it would be to use a component cable or hdmi cable at both ends to have a complete high quality signal chain.<br>  <br>  If you only have scarts on your dvd or cable box then you obviously can do this, therefore the the only way to get any imrovement to the signal is to buy the best quality, fully wired scart cable that you can afford; although I guess as you specified you had a gold plated cable that you were aware of that anyway.
Dgr5Otkwaa	The whole start-up surge thing came from old CRT TVs.  The tube in CRT TVs need heating up before they can be used, so to speed that process up, CRT TVs used to draw a large amount of current when first switched on.<br>  <br>  Also, this gave rise to the whole "Don't leave your TV on standby" thing, because CRTs would keep the tube hot when on standby so that switched on faster.<br>  <br>  All of this is essentially no longer relevant for modern flat panel TVs.  A modern TV will not draw a substantial current when turned on, nor will it waste excessive amounts of electricity when left on standby.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps,<br>  Dave|`|N0UUmjDlaa	It really depends on what you call "short time". Many people leave TV's permanently on standby. Many modern sets don't have a true OFF, similar to more modern computers.<br>  I have always advocated using a full off situation if the TV itself HAS a mains switch, as most older sets did. Certainly, turn off at the wall outlet if going away on holidays or something. <br>  I wouldn't worry about power consumption. I'd only worry about possible failure when nobody's around to see, or know it's happened!<br>  Most modern appliances have "switch mode" power supplies, TV's and computers especially. When first switched on, a very heavy current flows (you may have noticed your lights dim just as you switch something on!), but this is a very short duration event. It happens so fast that I would doubt the common spinning disc house electrical meter would even register it! <br>  Maybe someone else might advise ME on that one.

RTzJhnBSaa	I think there's several ways they can make Earthbound.<br>  <br>  If they decide RPG, the Wiimote can be used for actions around areas outside of battles, perhaps with sorts of interactions you can perform with the environment around you. For example, maybe you can be able to fill out side quests, like looking for a missing pet in the bushes. When you walk up to bushes or trees, you could point the Wiimote and hit A to search whatever object you're pointing to. Or you could shake the Wiimote to shake the object instead. One or the other, possibly both. Maybe to talk with people you can point to them and hit 1. You could also jump on your bikes (or a new method of transportation) with 2 or B.<br>  More than likely the Nunchuk would just be for moving the characters about, but maybe the Z button could help organize them together in different patterns for purposes of completing tasks like having the characters step on switches at the same time. (I.E.: Let's use Earthboud/Mother 2's characters Ness, Paula, Jeff, and Poo. One formation has Ness lead, but another has them all together, side by side. And possibly another sends Paula and Jeff to the back with Ness and Poo in the front.)<br>  Inside battles, the Wiimote acts as a pointer to choose attacks. Maybe, to pull off stronger and more powerful forms of these attacks, you could shake or turn the Wiimote. You could also have to press buttons to do so. The Z button on the Nunchuk could be your defense mechanism, to help guard yourself from attacks and take less damage. I guess this would be a pretty big enhancement for the series, but it sounds like a good one in my opinion. (And not just because I thought of it, lol.)<br>  <br>  If it's more like an Adventure or Platformer (which would be a really crazy twist and change of pace), then maybe you could have some Wiimote functions the same. Like the whole searching part and guarding, possibly the formations (in which case would be changed to the C button). Possibly, the B/2 button can become a method of attacking or jumping. Or you could swing and twist the Wiimote while holding down the button for various combinations to make different types of attacks. (I.E.: PK Flash could start off mashing the A button and as it rises into the air, shake the Wiimote. Then, as it's about to fall, flick the Wiimote to send it down with a stronger impact.) The 1 button could double as jumping and for talking to people. And you could work things out from there I suppose.<br>  <br>  There's plenty of ways to design Earthbound. It's just that the developers of Nintendo are stuck with making games that appeal people everywhere instead of the usual batch of games. More than likely, if we ever got to see Earthbound 3/Mother 4, it'd be on the DSi. Which would be lame, since there are tons of more possibilities on the Wii in my opinion. Instead you just tap and draw. -_- Seriously, I love the DS, but for Earthbound, that's limiting. We need someone inside the company to shout out "Hey Nintendo, get Earthbound onto the Wii pronto!" so we can finally get attention. And while we're at it...maybe a Kirby Wii and Star Fox Wii would be cool...I'm getting tired of Mario.<br>  <br>  Well, that's what I thought of. I wish Nintendo would so we'd have something that epic or maybe even better than what I can come up with. Back with the N64, it seemed that way. If they could just get a little more creative...oh well. Hope you like it!|`|BMConIedaa	It's an RPG.  Why would they add motion controls?  Battles take place from a first person perspective.  If you ever played Mother 3 for the GBA, you might've been exposed to it's unique battle system.  Maybe they'd do a maraca-like thing for rhythm-hits.  But who knows if they'll even do a follow-up.|`|LnYr2dLfaa	Like most Wii games these days you would probably use the Wii-mote and Nunchuk to control Ness (if he was going to be the main character) or the Wii-mote held on its side.<br>  <br>  I don't really see motion sensitive controls fitting into an Earthbound game - unless if you used the Wii-mote as a pointer to guide Ness around and flick the Wii-mote to make him jump etc.|`|X7KjqVy5aa	Well, if one was made for the Wii, you'd probably use it with the nunchuk like in Legend of Zelda TP. But if they were to use different effects for the game, they could try having you swing the Wiimote like a baseball bat for the main characters attacks, since Ness uses a baseball bat, Paula uses a frying pan, and Poo uses Sword (if you can find it). The only character that would be different would be Jeff because he uses guns, but that's kind of obvious as to how you'd be able to incorporate that into the game. Then there could also be motion-sensitive mini-games in the game. There's a whole realm open for the Wii when it comes to Earthbound.|`|My0D4lmVaa	Odds are it'd be an RPG, and thus the motions would really only be used for the on-screen pointer.

IF they can't do it, you can download them. <a href="http://www.americaschoicetoday.com/Ringtones.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.americaschoicetoday.com/Ringt...</a>|`|CDai9nMwaa	Ringback tones are fun, and easy. its .99 cents a month... then 1.99 for every one you buy. so its not horrible. but you do have to pay for it. but they have a TON of different ones to choose from, they prolly have yours already. you can add it to your account yourself my going to MyVerizon on www.verizonwireless.com|`|fBGsOcQqaa	No, you would need to subscribe to ringback tones through verizon (a monthly fee) and then also purchase the song as a ringback tone. You can manage ringbacktones online via my account.
MrQqVFrpaa	That has happened to me sometimes. I found out how to fix this because the artist has to be EXACTLY the same. For example if you have 5 songs from Chris Brown. Let's say you search your iPod for Chris Brown, maybe you have one song that has " CHris Brown" instead of "Chris Brown". Notice the space and the capital H. Little things like that can cause this. Also make sure there is no space in front of the artist. For example "Chris Brown " Hope this helps. :)|`|IoVwHn3Eaa	fix incorrect tagging with <br>  Fixtunes<br>  <br>  this should fix it<br>  <br>  theat happens to me too sometime|`|Nm9p9LDsaa	most likely it's bc some of the letters are capital n some are common n stuff....tags fix all of em and check it twice!!
mjsS54JXaa	No, it has no WiFi and everything needs to run through T-Mobiles servers, so Sidekick Plan is the only option.
5AnA0MLTaa	I would check the fable 2 guides on ign.com
QotypMKoaa	ventones it is a website online that has no viruses|`|1e9430635747058e8661817275bad909aa	The best way I know is to download a program that enables you to transfer saved songs to your phone than you won't have to pay anything for them. I tried once to edit the song clip so it fit on my phone, it worked but I didn't have the proper program to transfer the song to my phone. So I suggest u try to find programs to edit songs and to transfer songs to your phone and also get yourself a wire to transfer the songs. |`|tIMW3MWAaa	myxer.com, best site ever, you can search for songs, change what section of the song. you can even upload your own song if you can't find it|`|ENG0lgdMaa	Okay, this is so cool! This is how I got several of my ringtones...<br>  Download LimeWire onto your computer. (It's free) You can browse and select any song imaginable!! I think Limewire creates its own file when you select songs to download. Anywho, go to Myxer.com, create unique ringtone, upload your songs and tweak them. You can pick any part of the song for your ringtone and how long to play it. Then send it to your phone. I love both those websites! Theres alot you can do on them! I hope this works for you!!|`|3csUXUzCaa	I also have A Samsung phone and I was never able to get FREE ring tones without buying a plan first. so wat i do is I record the part of the song that i want as the ring tone and then send it to myself.<br>  <br>  Steps!<br>  1. open windows media player/Itunes if you have the song downloaded to ur computer/or just insert a CD with the song on it.   or even just go on www.youtube.com<br>  <br>  2. go to ur 'my sounds'<br>  <br>  3. go to 'record new'<br>  <br>  4. record the part of the song that u want (usually they can last for 1 minute)<br>  <br>  5. send the sound to YOURSELF<br>  <br>  6. get the message, hit options (normally by the right soft key), and hit set as ring tone!<br>  <br>  hope that gets u your ringtones!

Dgr5Otkwaa	Hiya, congrats on your purchase of a plasma TV.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry too much about running-in a modern day plasma set to be quite honest.  They're much more resilient than they used to be.  <br>  <br>  Assuming you have a new panasonic 8th Gen, or a Pioneer 9th Gen set, then not much is required at all.  The most important thing with a new screen such as this is that it is calibrated correctly for general viewing.<br>  <br>  I would _strongly_ suggest you get yourself a calibration disc like Digital Video Essentials, and run that. This will instruct you how to adjust the brightness and contrast of the set so that your TV looks great, and lasts ages.  It will also tell you how to adjust colour/tint/etc, but in terms of picture quality and longevity, brightness and contrast will make the biggest difference.<br>  <br>  Once calibrated, you won't have anything to worry about.  In general with plasmas, you'll want to avoid leaving computer games on pause for long periods, or leaving DVDs on the menu screen, but pay particular attention to this for the first few months.  And if you were still worried about running-in, I would suggest perhaps turn down the brightness setting (and perhaps the contrast too) just a few notches for the first 200 hours of use.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps,<br>  Dave|`|lFhFi9FXaa	How would you break in a TV, you turn it on and its on? I don't believe there is a break in period, never heard of that|`|AA10492776	Here is what the manufacturer recommends: The break-in period is the first 100 hours of usage. Keep your picture (contrast) and brightness at or below 50% during the break-in period. Keep the picture full and moving. Black screen does not age the phosphors of a plasma TV, therefore avoid the black letter boxes and pillars for any extended period of time. There is no special DVD; just watch what ever you like as long as the image is moving and it fills the screen. Use your format/aspect/p size button on your remote to help keep the screen full.<br>  <br>  I violate these procedures all the time at work whenever I setup a new plasma TV and I've never had a problem with burn-in. I don't think its that critical with the newer plasma TVs, but it can't hurt to follow these recommendations.
sF9Tb26Gaa	Yeah, I had the same problem.. you just have to close every program that  uses your internet connection, or restart your computer, open iTunes and try to download again...
xClfM52Yaa	The new ipod touch is really cool and really nice to use but i love the colour range on the new nano's. I would personally recomend the Ipod touch as it is easy to use and you can chose the amount of memory 8gig or 16gig. <br>  Go for the touch!<br>  |`|vIF4rNUcaa	there both good just ones got more memory i went with a nano |`|K8x8dyqSaa	I'd say i'm pretty pleased with the new Nano's, i have one but it's only 8GB, i would've preferred the 16GB
AA10333241	tell your parents that your phone is messed up and having glitches.<br>  or ask them if they would let you buy a sidekick and if they say no tell them you'll do good at school. (if you go to school)|`|gaXUIduMaa	Looks like you might be on a spending spree so be careful.<br>  I'm not sure you can get the exact one this way but you could get something similar.  Many of the cell phone providers offer a free or heavily discounted phone usually if you agree to continue your service for x amount of time (often a year or two).   Beware that if you terminate early, there is a termination fee so make sue you understand the terms.  Anyway, print out the offer for the $300 phone and the phone companies offer.  Tell your parents that you would like to get a new phone and that you have a couple choices that you like and point out the conditions of the cheaper price.  They will probably let you get the cheaper one as you are showing that you are watching your money and shopping around.  <br>  I got a $350 phone for about $75 with a two year commitment from SprintPCS.<br>  And $6,000 isn't really a whole lot these days.|`|nr6KBe8Naa	wow! ur a brat!  but i would "accidently" drop my phone in the toilet. thats what happened to me and i said it fell out of my back pocket i fake cried for a while and sat around all sad and i got the env2! good luck!|`|g2KBzcVqaa	<br>  <br>  drop yours in a sink of water so it shorts out. dry it off, and show it to the parents. look ma, it don't work no more! i "NEED" a new phone!!!!|`|xUwWxKjhaa	Tell them that you have the money and that it is pretty much your money and tell them you will work to make up the 300$ it cost<br>  sounds cool.. hows the Itouch?? let mee kno<br>  |`|YAJvT2hlaa	try craigslist.com they should have some phones at a cheaper price|`|cJxA43mdaa	so here is what i recommend show her all the flaws that the phone contains, tell her its gonna be with your own money and this line always works for me<br>  <br>  "mom, you showed me right from wrong, if i waste my money foolishly let me learn to save it next time, or what, your teaching were wrong? I dont think so"|`|6wZ6tZtBaa	just give yr parents like some huuuge essay (hey you could even make a powerpoint;] ) on why youu should get a phone && that yr mature enough to make yr own desicions && that its yr money & you should spend it how yoou chooosee ((: and by the time you go through all this hard work to ask them&& then they'll realize that you really want this & give in to saying yesss.. ooorrr. yu can negotiate or make a deal with themm.<br>  <br>  haaaah.<br>  hope i helped =DD|`|dKr2RtVKaa	smash your phone. i got my mom to let me get a new phone when i was having "problems" with mine. i told her that i was having lots and lots of problems and would just yell at my phone all the time. after like 3 days she let me get a new phone. |`|NMhTSmvuaa	Find it cheaper on ebay and show them what a great deal it is.  I wanted a Chocolate 2 but our contract resign and upgrade wasn't for another 8 months.  The phone was 300 something bucks at a verizon store, 400 some odd bucks at walmart without a contract.  I found it on Ebay for $100|`|vIPa8KiPaa	its your money so just go out and buy<br>  they cant stop u<br>  u earned the money<br>  u should spend it on whatever u want<br>  =]<br>  <br>  nice u got an ipod touch<br>  =D|`|jj43fJlQaa	just break or lose it easy!!!|`|Tzx45MRuaa	you have the money.. just do it.
TcBH8MZJaa	I personally would go for the Classic.<br>  <br>  I found the iTouch far too awkward and difficult to use, and I only have small fingers, but its strong, I doubt you'd break it easily. My friend has dropped hers numerous times, it only has superficial damage, chips and scratches and the like.<br>  <br>  The Classic has a fair sized screen for music videos or movies, and has a large capacity for storing everything you could possibly ever want, and you can download games off iTunes for the Classic also.<br>  <br>  Goodluck!|`|Nzk70xVwaa	I would go for the Classic because I prefer to have more space and I don't really need to have all those extra applications.|`|fWLuaIoqaa	no the touch is really strong and resistant<br>  while a screen protector is a plus it inst really needed because the screen is made of tough glass<br>  <br>  and breaking it is really difficult unless you drop it from like a 2 story building onto a concrete surface<br>  <br>  plus movies look awesome on the touches screen cuz its bigger nd wider than that of the classic<br>  and a 2 hour movies doesn't even take 1 gig probably like 600-800 mb but that's nothing to a 16 gig touch <br>  I have an 8gig and i have 3 movies on there a ton of apps and games and 3 gigs of music and i still have like 1.5 gigs left<br>  <br>  so you make the choice|`|Qrj1OKwcaa	Touch NEEDS a screen cover and movies take a lot of space.
Lx0fpmhsaa	i would say that the battery is dead and not ant good that is why you got it so cheap may need to get a different phone some places got them on friday black day sales for like 10 dollars 
3tuwWidiaa	The word is that they have 2 years.  If Verizon doesn't mean targets, then RIM can make available to to other carriers.  For technology, 2 years is a long time.  So, as a practical matter, don't count on seeing the Storm from anyone but Verizon.  By the time the agreement ends, there will be other products.|`|v4BTTvfZaa	There is already probably something similar that AT&T carries.  Verizon is a better cell company anyway. |`|pyB2nLx9aa	Yeah, don't bother unlocking it, it will not work with AT&T (or T-Mobile for that matter). Verizon is it for now -- not sure for how long though. My guess is at least a year, but probably longer :-( |`|Besziz9Xaa	As of now, verizon is the only US carrier. There might be a slight chance that the Storm could expand to at&t but the odds are against it since they use two different networks. |`|kz7ddS4Oaa	Go buy a Storm unlock code and enter it on the blackberry storm.... you can use ANY company then :D
i5RlIh88aa	Ps3 needs a HDTv|`|CPXsFgp9aa	My guess is to let the reformating go on for a few hours just to see what happens.

A lot of them don't leave a number to find out who it is as they are through a switchboard and a lot of these numbers are withheld.  To cut them down you can contact your telephone service provider and refuse to have witheld calls put through to your number but then there is the problem that if someone you know works in a large office, quite often their number won't get through either!|`|juUYQyGCaa	Have you considered having the latest caller ID which would tell you who your caller is?

d82fcd44a7e95a000024e72ae8bbffdbaa	A lot of people get caught up in the megapixel thing. Really, 5 is superb. You can create prints 8x11 that look great! Really anything bigger is poster size. Or if you do a lot of cropping. 3 mp is also great and since they 3mp ... they are cheaper! :)<br>  <br>   So, 6mp is great. But... dont think just about that, think about optical zoom, LCD screen size, camera specs, functions. <br>  <br>   Since the image sensor in a point and shoot is usually smaller the images are good. If you get a digital SLR you will have great shots.. the image sensor is quite bigger.|`|2dba7c5ddf580b1fe89e3e4ac2a778f7aa	You do want to purchase a camera witha manual zoom, not a digital one.  Digital xooms tend to distort images, where an optical lens does not.  Hope this help you confusion (or adds to it, LOL)|`|2bf32f01e482a052eab6ca3f3ddabbc0aa	i own a 5mp and it takes great pic. the more mp are ok if you want to enlarge them. but if your sticking with 4x6 the 5 or 6 would be just fine|`|7f9dc0b736d36cca5aad33da0750941baa	5-6MP is good for regular 4R size, but anything bigger than that will require more pixels. also, pay more attention on the zoom ( eg 4X zoom)it determines the overall quality of the camera|`|AA12043620	there isn't a whole lot of difference between 5mp to 6mp.<br>  Although if you are going to do any large prints such as 8x10 or larger, I'd buy he 6mp.<br>  Stay away from the 3MP. Also look for the camera in your price range with the highest optical zoom.<br>  Good luck!

c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	I also have an old HP M417 camera that is really great.  The following may help you keep it going and find a new camera.<br>  <br>  A friend asked me to clean and charge her new 2000mAh Duracell batteries as described in the next link.  Those batteries are still going strong after four months of normal use and have not been recharged.<br>   <br>  Click this link for other camera tips and complete instructions on cleaning camera and battery electrical contacts. <br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/base/a/4210404/D13701973093918363271" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/base/a/4210404/D13...</a><br>   <br>  Most NiMH rechargeable batteries lose charge and should be recharged when not used after two weeks, but Duracell and RayOVac new formula 2000mAh NiMH batteries hold charge one year when not used.  Also, 2000mAh batteries seem to have a longer life.  Did not like these batteries at first, but have 12 over five years old and all are still as good as new.  Higher mAh batteries (about one year old) still work well in flashlights, but won't start my camera.<br>  <br>  In new cameras, look for a viewfinder (LCD invisible in bright sun), optical image stabilizer, and check battery prices.  High mega pixel settings take longer to process and may not be needed unless required for very large pictures.  Maximum print size for a 3 mega pixel setting is 8 x 10 inches. Click links below for more details.<br>  <a href="http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.jhtml?pq-path=398&pq-locale=en_US&_requestid=2039" rel="nofollow">http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.j...</a> ...<br>  <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/mpmyth.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/mpmyth.h...</a> ...<br>   <br>  What gives a camera its picture quality?  <br>  It is mostly the skill of the photographer that produces high quality pictures. The lens and camera are very important, but the ability to set the scene, adjust the cameras settings, and hold the camera very still or use a tripod with auto or remote shutter actuation when required is what gets the great pictures.  Megapixel resolution is about potential photo size, not picture quality.<br>   <br>  The Canon A590IS is a slightly older model that is available everywhere at great sale prices. Think it is a great camera and a best buy. It has auto focus, a viewfinder, optical image stabilization, and uses rechargeable NiMH batteries.  <br>  <a href="http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/A590IS/A590ISA.HTM" rel="nofollow">http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/A5...</a> ...<br>  <a href="http://bountii.com/deal-1523871-canon-powershot-8-0-megapixel.html" rel="nofollow">http://bountii.com/deal-1523871-canon-po...</a> ...<br>   <br>  There is no one particular place to get great buys, but you may see something above that really helps you find the best buy. Click on the second link in the information above for an example then search for your camera of choice at the upper left.  Camera prices at this link change often.  <br>   <br>  You may never need expanded wide angle or telephoto capabilities, but the A590 IS is compatible with Canon's accessory lens adapters: A small button next to the lens bezel is actually a latch; press it and you can remove the bezel ring, exposing a bayonet mount for accessory lenses. Canon offers the WC-DC52 0.7x wide-angle lens, the TC-DC52A telephoto lens, the 250D 52mm closeup lens separately, along with the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them on the camera. (Note that the wide, tele, and macro lenses all need the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them to the camera. The lenses won't work by themselves.)<br>   <br>  This could be the best slim line camera with a viewfinder and ... It's PINK, but it uses a $49.50 Series G Rechargeable 960mAh lithium-ion battery.<br>  <a href="http://shopping.yahoo.com/p:Sony%20Cyber-shot%20DSC-W150%2FR%20Digital%20Camera:1995337750;_ylc=X3oDMTB0bjZzaWNuBF9TAzk2NjMyOTA3BHNlYwNmZWVkBHNsawNlbGVj">http://shopping.yahoo.com/p:Sony%20Cyber...</a> ...<br>  <a href="http://www.digitalcamerareview.com/default.asp?newsID=3462&review=sony+cybershot+w150" rel="nofollow">http://www.digitalcamerareview.com/defau...</a> ...<br>   <br>  CAUTION   Do not overcharge!  Batteries can be damaged.  Use an automatic two or more hour Energizer Compact smart charger with temperature monitor, trickle charge technology, and safety timer ($9.76) at Walmart.  Use pre-charged 2000mAh Duracell ($12.97) or RayOVac ($5.97) batteries (both hold charge one year) and a full cycle charge. To preserve battery charge, use the viewfinder.<br>   <br>  CAUTION   To prevent memory card corruption, keep batteries charged, format in camera, and don't delete or fill card completely.  Wait for lights to stop flashing then turn camera off before removing memory.  For card readers, double click Safely Remove Hardware.  Select, then click Stop and OK.<br>   <br>  Lots of great camera tips in this link. <br>  <a href="http://www.danscamera.com/Learning/going_digital/#resolution" rel="nofollow">http://www.danscamera.com/Learning/going...</a> ...<br>   <br>  My camera has 5.2 megapixel, but I use 3 most of the time because it gives great results, is faster, and takes less memory. Also, it only has a 3 x optical zoom and 7 x digital zoom. I never use the digital zoom because making pictures larger works better on the computer. This is an old camera, but everyone is impressed with the quality pictures it takes ... like magic. <br>   <br>  Check with the Geeks in several stores and compare prices.  Once you select a camera, read all about it in the owner's manual.  You can view owners manuals at this link, but will need to Login. <a href="http://www.retrevo.com/s/digital+camera" rel="nofollow">http://www.retrevo.com/s/digital+camera</a> ...<br>   <br>  The source links show most of the cameras out there with prices and make digital cameras work better with help on cleaning camera and battery electrical contacts.|`|RCbtRF4xaa	I recommend Canon PowerShot SD880IS <br>  I picked this camera because: <br>  It has a wide angle lens, this can make it better for taking pictures in rooms as you can get more in the picture. <br>  It takes video, I wanted to be able to make simple videos without having to drag a larger format video camera around with me wherever I go. <br>  It records sound along with the video as well as simply acting as a sound recorder, this lets me record conversations without the need to always take notes. <br>  It is ultra compact, this means I can carry it everywhere I go using a belt clip so I don't miss a snap because I didn't want to carry a camera. I'm lazy like that. <br>  It is manufactured by a camera company and not a computer company, the implication being that the optics are in theory better. <br>  <br>  Canon PowerShot SD880IS <br>  10.0-megapixel resolution allows greater freedom when editing and printing <br>  4x optical zoom with Optical Image Stabilizer; 28mm wide-angle lens <br>  3.0-inch PureColor LCD II for bright, accurate color with wide viewing angle <br>  DIGIC 4 Image Processor improves Face Detection, adds Servo AF, Face Detection Self-Timer and Intelligent Contrast Correction <br>  Captures images to SD/SDHC memory cards <br>  <br>  Price: $247.95 <br>  reference: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Canon-PowerShot-SD880IS-Stabilized-Silver/dp/B001G5ZTN6/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&s=photo&qid=1236260012&sr=1-8&tag=commentglitte-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Canon-PowerShot-SD...</a><br>  <br>  hope that help

771a432239749c75069cce288603b99eaa	Genrally i would say yes sony are uite good fones. They have come a long way in recent years, from the old says of the t610 etc. The only downside that i wud draw attention to is the the charger connection can sometimes become faulty i had 2 go within a 6week period so watch for that. Otherwise the software is reasonable easy to use and the uality isnt too bad although not to the high standard of other manufacturers( eg nokia or samsung) With regard to what fone is right for you that rather depends on what u wish to use it for mainly. 90% of the handsets availabl today will do the usuall fone calls and texting and internet browsing but if u tend to use ur camera for instance a lot or u text alot then id suggest a reasonably high end fone. All manufacturers have thier advantages and downfalls however take a moment to decide what u wud like ur new fone to look like, eg candybar,slide or flip. will u want a touchscreen or instant access to emails ? all these things need to be thought of in addition to the most important factor.....UR BUDGET !  I can recommend the new nokia n-series. n95s are coming up secondhand at great prices and same can be said for samsung handsets...this is not to say that they are rubbish fones but just a little older design and some people like to have the latset fone and tend to sell thier old ones to get a new one. Many bargains can be had on ebay and other such auction sites as well. <br>  Sony erricson tend to concentrate thier speciality on both audio (mp3 playback) and cameras. The software that comes with a sony is excellent for transfering mp3 files from pc to fone. Hope this helps good luck|`|2404nDvSaa	My mom has one in white and is in love with it!

jN5SXl5Caa	I would say the people above have it correct. Except I think putting it in the box is bad. I was told if you play the PS3 for like 3-4 hours and then put the hot system immediately into a cardboard box (which insulates the heat) and then in another bag. The heat will find it hard to dissipate. You should just leave it hooked up.|`|a5abc95c0baa7453e31caa755c283f91aa	You want to try and not move it as much as possible. Freezing can be due to internal chip interface problems or wiring, and moving it along would explain a wiring problem. Putting it in the box doesn't pose any problems other than the fact of just unhooking it and moving it again. I'm not sure if you use the standard a/v video hook ups or HDMI but every time you plug and unplug those ports, it loosens them, making it harder for the playstation to send an output signal. If the problem is within the PS3, like the chip, you are going to have to get a hold of Sony and send it back in for repair. As far as the game goes, unless the game is scratched incredibly much, it shouldn't be the cause of your freezing, and if so, I don't think any retailer would take it back. You might have to swallow the cost of the game and get you another one, if that is the problem.Hope this helps, good luck with your PS3.|`|R39zpV2Gaa	no the ps3 is durable and it's the game, because i had my ps3 for a year and my rsv2 games freezes rarely.<br>  <br>  Edit: and how do you carry it? do you carry it in a book bag? how hard do you set it down? <br>  <br>  I say this because like the dude above me said, if you move it around too much and set it down too hard.  Could cause a wire to come loose.
FkVMOTZtaa	where are you from that would make you shy in particular to Americans?<br>  And you can look at it like this, it doesn't matter what any one on PS3 thinks about you does it? not like they will ever meet you, so no need to be shy.|`|Hiasgb75aa	Well you don't have to speak unless necessary but if you do it doesn't really matter much. Are you embarrassed to start a conversation or when somebody talks to you?|`|xwEPYEqSaa	I feel the same way when I play Warhawk, Motorstorm or LBP online I'm too shy to talk even if I here it's a kid that sounds like he is 10 on the other side.|`|yrQFXxcXaa	Sharoz are you a wacko jacko fan? she/he ain't billie jean so she/he won't just beat it : )<br>  <br>  As for the shyness on the mic just be yourself nobody will know who you are & you don't have to have a full on conversation it is mainly used for tactics & shouting at the rest of the players to get the F*** out the way lol, just try it out, what harm can it do?<br>  <br>  Also if you are a girl & are worried about guys being rude to you which I have never heard of on the PS3, you can go to accessory settings on the PS3 menu & use voice changer so you have a deep or squeaky voice.|`|HekFanRvaa	When you say american, did you mean people speaking english in general? Some people are really like you. <br>  <br>  I'm from the philippines but I'm not shy talking to them. I hate talking to them because they mostly talk nonsense and they always try to dominate the game. I hate those COD4 player who always say " Skip it! Skip it!" I would just say, dude.. get out of this game and find yourself another map!<br>  <br>  Well, what you can do is make friends with people from your country. Go to PS Home and make friends there and  ask them what games they play, etc. <br>  <br>  You really don't ahve to talk when you dont want to. Just mute the rest of the players.|`|1WgOj89kaa	Why not just talk to people you know, not people who are complete strangers.

Unlocking is to make the phone that you bought from a Network Service be usable to any other networks around the globe (AT&T, Verizon, Rogers, Vodafone, etc.). If you buy phones from Network Services Centers, then the phone will be locked to that network, however if you buy one from the retailer (such as Apple for the iPhone 3G, Nokia Store for the nokia phones, etc.), then it will be unlocked.<br>  <br>  Jailbreaking is a term used by internet junkies that refers to changing critical system files in order to make the device be-usable by 3rd Party Applications. In other words, jailbreaking means hacking your phone making you able to install cracked games and applications such as Asphalt 4: Elite Racing, Real Football 2009, etc. Both the iPhone and the iPod touch is able to Jailbreak given the set of tool.

If for example, you have a Toronto number and travel to Ottawa, then every single call you receive (regardless of where the call originates from) would be a long distance call - this would be since the call would have to be routed from Toronto to Ottawa.

If you look at the metal pin at the end of the jack on each side of the connector cable, you will see only 1 thin band like circle for MONO pins and 2 circles for STEREO.  Thats the way you can identify a stereo jack.

4b83fbb412c2a180104b57ff5efa494daa	The iPod is a personal Mp3 player, first created by Apple in 2001. As of today, the most recent iPod is a generation 5.5, and can hold up to 20,000 songs or a large amount of Movies. The iPod has become so popular that almost all Mp3 players are referred to as iPods, even though they aren't created by Apple.<br>  <br>  There are 3 basic types of iPods, as of today. There are the Video iPods, which come in 30GB and 80 GB. Then there are the iPod nanos, which span from 2 GB to 8GB and come in 5 colors. The smallest of all the iPods are the iPod shuffles, which comes in a 1GB package.<br>  <br>  The difference between The iPod video and the shuffle and the nano is that the iPod video is a hard drive (like in your computer) and the shuffle and nano are flash drives (like a thumb-drive). The advantage of flash drives are that they have no moving parts, making them very durable and advantageous for atheletes.<br>  <br>  One of the things that made the iPod distinctive is the click wheel, which requres you to move your finger in a circular motion to access songs, videos, and the like. Another was the huge amount of advertising, and the final one is the program called iTunes, which blends seamlessly with the iPod.<br>  <br>   iTunes displays your music videos and podcasts (think: radio shows), and allows you to buy (or obtain as podcasts are free) more at the iTunes Store. <br>  <br>  There are rumors of a new 6th generation iPod coming out in early 2007 that has no click wheel but is completely touch screen.|`|f4a0c5666add7fb98ab6ce215b884c79aa	Ipod is just a name of an Mp3 player that made by Apple company. many people get confuse and called many Mp3 player as Ipod even it is not made by Apple.

Dgr5Otkwaa	The component that currently makes the Xbox 360 noisy is the DVD drive.<br>  <br>  So far Microsoft refused to comment on whether the Elite's DVD drive is any quieter, all they did say was something like "We always use the latest, most advanced and most reliable components when building our consoles".  <br>  <br>  Which is a bit vague to say the least, but I do know that the DVD drive in the Elite IS DIFFERENT to the current Xbox 360's drive ... so if we beleive that they use the latest and greatest components, then I would hope it is quieter.|`|5E31L2coaa	No the new 360 elite has the new "Ben Q" drive which is quieter drive than the previous 2 that were used.|`|7921426e4f30310f0fcd2d8b73b58787aa	nno it is perfrctly quite unless less it is screwed|`|jPqW6bkdaa	no not really.|`|29fa2f5d1b523e24c5ee82c851d681e6aa	I am sure it will be just as noisy as the current version.
AA11186590	Yes and No<br>  Verizon has a new policy. If it does not belong to Verizon, THEY WONT ACTIVATE IT!. Supposedly because it limits the subscriber from using all of the Verizon Features<br>  <br>  If it was a GSM phone, all you have to do is switch the Sim card and your good to go!|`|E1jGXzLkaa	First, you have to have a plan to put the phone on.<br>  Second, you need to pay to activate the phone. I think with verizon you actually might be able to do it online for free or if you call the 1-800 number they charge a small fee for reactivating another phone, if that's what you did.  <br>  <br>  Oh ya, and the phone can't be stolen.|`|xlYr0Spfaa	yes you can use it with any carrier|`|AyWNXw43aa	Yes, you can use it with any carrier.

kby1ksuraa	No, as long as you have a message bundle, messages count the same no matter if they are just text or multimedia.  However, for t-mobile outside of plan, multimedia messages are .25c a piece whereas text messages are only .10c.|`|Qo4J3eNtaa	Yes. SMS messages are totally different than just text. they cost more. I have Nextel and i pay about .40 more a message then just text. Yes they have packages but even so you still pay more for SMS messages.
2NRCJgq2aa	The person you hire to fabricate the device.  The patent office.  You know .. the things you have to do if it's a really good idea, so that other's don't take it and you can find investors to back you.|`|E1jGXzLkaa	Give me 25% of whatever you make and I can help you. I'll be your agent.<br>  <br>  If your interested send me an email.|`|0f3f705969ab1ce4cbb7ecd9d8f30eebaa	Your closest friend.. the person you trust most|`|LAGKOiEKaa	Before you do anything look into getting it patented or copyrighted.  Save yourself some grief before sharing it with a large corporation.  That way if they like it they will have to buy ALL RIGHTS from you.  This way you are also protected if they decided to go behind your back.  <br>  <br>  As far as where to go, try contacting Apple and ask to speak to that particular department that handles your type of question.  I am sure a supervisor or manager might be able to direct your call properly; more so than a customer service rep.  Or try to get a number for their corporate offices.  That is probably where I would start.  Do not reveal your idea until you are protected though.  So be careful especially if you intend on making money off it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|cecedbdad6c5cc825f5a85e7858d41a0aa	There are tons of things you can do, you can contact InventHelpSM.  They are a company who specializes in helping inventors have thier ideas brought to reality and to the industry market.  <br>  <br>  If you are comfortable enough you can also contact Apple directly and give them your idea in a presentation.
Dgr5Otkwaa	The contrast of a TV set is it's ability to differentiate black and white.  So to give a simple answer your question, the one that has a contrast ratio of 1600:1 is probably better than the one with 1200:1.<br>  <br>  It should be noted however that different manufacturers measure contrast in different ways, and it is widely known that the results can be somewhat skewed.<br>  <br>  But if you're looking at one manufacturer, and one set has 1000:1 and another has 2000:1, the 2000:1 set will have blacker blacks, and whiter whites.|`|dd52677014b6bdfab60ff5cb7e35a0c9aa	no doubt, SONY BRAVIA|`|LI9bsSVIaa	The contrast ratio will determine the sharpness of the image.  The higher the ratio, the sharper the image. The higher the ratio, the higher the price.
