They pay a lot of money to the car manufactures to get that info, and therefore have to charge in return.   You should be able to go to your local library, and check to see if they may have a Chilton or Mitchell manual for you to copy or   look at.

Slow and steady acceleration, avoid jackrabbit starts,and try running consistent speed on highway. with that engine 2500rpm is generally the breaking point where it starts to drink.    Listen to your engine while you drive, you'll feel and hear the difference in the sound and when the power picks up between 2500-3100 rpm.when you know where that point is.

Good Luck|`|K6BrNlfvaa	Remove the nut that is holding the ball joint to the control arm. There should be a cotter pin that needs to be removed first. After removing the nut hit the side of the control arm as close to the ball joint as possible it will probally take a few good smacks with a hammer, once the ball joint comes loose you will be able to just lift the steering knuckle and seperate the ball joint form the control arm. this is the easiest and being your replacing the control arm you wont have to worry about damaging the old one.

JM9l5l17aa	When gasoline burns it forms water and CO2.  So when you leave your car idling, the water will initially condense in the exhaust and the drip out.  Quite normal.    Not normal if it smells of gasoline, because that measn that you are running rich.  Or if it smells sweet like antifreeze, because that would be coolant leak.    But sounds normal to me from what you say.

rBcC0ricaa	The electrical problems you describe are probably caused by a voltage Spike from the Ignition Coil which is a common fault on the 1.4 engines, it will need to be replaced.  If you have a sagem coil then replace it for an electrifil unit especially if your car runs a Sagem sl96 management system as Sagem coils are rubbish and cause all sorts of electrical problems such as you describe.|`|AA11872632	Your 1998 306 is a phase two model with 30 fuses in the fusebox.  More complicated than the phase one, with 13 fuses.  I have the complete wiring diagrams at home... but now I am on vacation. I will look closely to see which wires can affect something in the steering column, and the spark plugs which you say 'misfire'.  By then, it will be too late to respond here, and you don't allow emails.  I will leave a 'comment' here in late October.    You said you disconnected the directional turn indicator multiplug?  My first guess was a faulty left turn switch, causing a short circuit, then affecting one of the main lines to the fuse box.  These 12 volt lines are called A, B, C..G  on a schematic.  Try to find a 306, phase two schematic, and see the colour of the major wires to the fuses, not after the fuses.    Even though you disconnected the indicator switch, the problem is occuring before electricity reaches there.      My SECOND thought was....your ignition key switch.  When you turn the key to position one, the fuel guage works, the teperature guage shows a cold engine (unless it is already warm).  There may be a short in the 6 ? heavy wires leading to the ignition, more likely inside the ignition barrel in the steering column.    LATER:  I just read the answer suggesting you replace your ignition coil.  This is certainly worth a try, if that person has seen and remedied the same problem before!  It is a replacement you can do yourself in the driveway.|`|j3f8m6REaa	Welcome to hell -- Peugeot electrical hell, that is.

HIQlMOQxaa	Excess air entering the engine will (contrary to other answerer) cause the engine to run lean, thereby increasing O2, CO2 and NOx emissions but causing CO and HC to fall. HC is just unburnt fuel, but in an excess of oxygen all the fuel burns.  The fault lies in your engine wiring loom between one of the Oxygen sensor connector wires and the ECU connector.    You will need to find out the pin numbers at each connector and do a resistance check of the wires with the connectors disconnected. Also check to make sure there is no corrosion of the pins.|`|b4c91799df505080847c94349b76d626aa	doest the engine run nicely .have you checked 4 air leaks ? have you also check that the exhaust is sealing air enetering the exhasut will cause faulse readings. your emmisions are way to high 4 that car you should get 0% to 0.5% co at the tail pipe your reading sujjest the cat is missing ! the fuel injectors could also be leaking.. there are a few breather pipes on them that are prone to splitting causing excess air in to the manifold increasing the air pressure in turn increasing the fuel ratio hence the high co and undurnt fuel "250ppm hc" hope that helps

One that gets good mileage. One that has air-conditioning (if you live in a hot clime) or a good heater (and heated seats if you live in a cold clime). Check the controls for the windshield wipers (do they have enough settings to work in drizzle and full-up storms?)    I personally use a Ford Escape Hybrid. I have friends with other hybrids (Toyota, passenger car and SUV), and all of us are happy with our choices. That said, there are very good mileage cars that have better mileage than the hybrid SUVs, so do look at non-hybrid cars too.

aKirAFKdaa	I agree a dual sport is the best beginner bike.  But the 250 ninja is designed as a beginner sport bike, so also a really good choice, and it will smoke an 883 sportster and get 80mpg doing it.  Safer than a sportster because the are lighter, more agile and have better braking.  Funner than a sportster because the are faster, lighter and more agile.  Also alot cheaper than a sportster.      Sorry but cruisers are for guys who are into motorcycling as a lifestyle, guys who see their bike as a fashion accessory.  I see motorcycling as a sport, I need sports equipment not a fashion accessory.      The kid who sees motorcycling as a lifestyle would be blessed to have a dad who wants to buy him a corny old sportster and a pair of assless chaps.  The kid who sees motorcycling as a sport is going to be miserable trying to enjoy a ride on a slug of a bike like the heavy, underpowered sportster.|`|fbxqLErlaa	Ninja 250 is my recommendation.  Cheaper to purchase, cheaper to own, easier to ride, much easier to sell.  Also, the Ninja will be a lot more fun to ride than the Harley.  The handlebar, seat, and peg relationship on the Harley just looks so uncomfortable.  I rode a 1200 Sportster one time.  Just a terrible machine.  Forward controls were awkward to use, pull back bars were uncomfortable, and the vibrations were unbelievable.  This was an earlier model with the rigid mounted engine.  Take a look at article below to see what a Ninja is capable of doing.|`|d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	I've owned Harley's and like them quite a lot, but I really have to disagree with your father. It sounds like he happens to be one of those guys that just thinks Harley is the only bike worth having and that is far from the truth. That is a fairly heavy bike for a beginner. I don't know that the 250R would be my first choice either, but I would certainly recommend it over an 883 for a beginner, especially if a cruiser isn't what you want.|`|fl60KL8oaa	The baby Ninja, pre '08, is about half the weight of the 883 -- the lighter weight makes for a much easier handling bike.  Also about half the cost.    Cruisers are not safer than standards or sports.  The people who tend to choose cruisers are generally safer riders.  If your idea of "fun" is zipping along in excess of the speed limit, canyon carving, and other sorts of risky riding then a cruiser is not more fun than a sport bike.    If you like the idea of lazy putt across the Mojave, on a two lane road with absolutely no one else on it, under the light of the Full Moon, then a cruiser is more fun.|`|0g2fDpUbaa	I am a cruiser rider, but I would never put a beginner rider on an 883 Sportster.  1)  It's  too much money for a starter bike  2) They tend to be a little top heavy (high center of balance) and therefore a little more difficult to get the hang of to start with  3) You, personally, are not interested in the cruiser style of bike.  You more than likely would not like the experience as much and ride less, which would decrease the amount of learning you would do on the bike.    Whereas I would not truly recommend the sport bike style for beginning riders, given the choice between the 2, go with the Ninja.|`|dNrR8sJGaa	Take a look at the Buell Blast. They are very easy to handle and owned by HD so that should keep dad happy. HD dealers sell them cheap after they are done using them for their Riders Training courses.

Go to a dealer and sit on all the bikes.|`|E0j6mhqhaa	For a learners bike, the Ninja is certainly the best choice.  Light weight, nimble and great looks for a little bike.  If you're a very small person and not very strong at all, then it's the way to go.      The 883 is a great bike for the money and isn't as "cruiserish" as some other HD bikes.  It gets excellent gas mileage, although not as good as the Ninja.  It's a bigger, heavier bike and not as nimble.  If you're a taller or larger, heavier person, it will provide the room to stretch out and the power to haul you around.  It can be customized in all sorts of ways to suit your individual style.      For stoplight to stoplight acceleration, yes the Ninja will smoke the 883.  If you want to keep up with 70-75 mph interstate traffic, the Ninja is at best going to get you plenty of honks, fist shaking and cussing and at worst, get you run over when you can't get out of someones way.  For high speed running like that, the little Ninja is going to be running at nearly wide open throttle which will kill the gas mileage.  At high speeds, the 883 will probably get as good or better mileage.  Besides, after you find out how fun bike riding is, you aren't going to be all that concerned about fuel mileage.    If you want to cross the country loaded down with gear, haul a passenger around or put on a 500 mile day, the 883 will do the job easily and in relative comfort.  A set of highway pegs, soft luggage and windshield and you'll be set to go anywhere you want.  While it could be done on the Ninja, you're going to be stiff and stove up at the end of the day and your fingers will be numb from the high frequency vibration.  Your passenger is going to take a pretty good beating though.  The crouched position pretty much rules out highway pegs to allow you to stretch your legs.  If you enjoy taking slower, 30-50 mile rides on curvy roads and enjoy reving the engine and shifting gears, then the Ninja is the best choice.  Not only because you can, but because you'll need to if you want to maintain a respectable speed.  The 883 won't deliver blinding accelleration, but it has enough power that once on the open road, you won't need to shift out of high gear when going around curves, up and down hills or passing.      Chances are, within 6 months you will have outgrown the Ninja and want something with more power.  I've been there and done that.  If the 883 doesn't have enough get up and go for you and you like tinkering on bikes, an upgrade kit with 1200cc jugs, better exhaust and camshaft will give you a LOT more power.  Certainly enough to keep you entertained for another year or two.    Sport bike riders like to point out that HD riders are more concerned about projecting an image than actual performance.  While there may be some truth to that and it's certainly true for some individuals, the little Ninja is no different.  It projects a sport bike image but little else.  I ride Kawasakis and love them but while a very competant bike, face it, there ain't no way 250cc will give true sport bike performance.  That tough little engine has been tweaked at the factory to pretty much deliver it's maximum power and there's hardly any modifications you can make to coax much more out of it.  The amount of money it would take to eek another 3 hp out of the Kawasaki would probably get you 20-30hp out of the Harley.    Incidently, while ninebadthing made some good points, that's his personal opinion and nothing more.  You know what they say about opinions being like a$$holes, everybody has one.  And if he ever tried some of his "a$$less chaps" as he calls them, he'd find they are very functional (as long as you wear jeans underneath! Ha!).  They break the wind and keep you warmer in cold weather but don't give you a heat stroke when you stop like the full leathers do that sport bike riders like to show off.  And most sport bike riders can't ride well enough to warrant leathers, so in that respect, they're just like the "look at me" cruiser wanna-bees they all chirp about.      In the end, it's all up to you.  The main thing to do is to think about the future.  When I first got a 360cc Honda, I had no intentions whatsoever of traveling more than a few miles from home.  Within 6 months I had a 750 and went on a 1,700 mile trip and since then have averaged at least one 3,000-5,000 mile trip each year.  Good luck.|`|556cc214a7493962346e6f458688b23baa	Ride your own ride.|`|ggR5FFDjaa	Two totally different bikes, you just need to decide what type of riding you want to do.  I never had much desire for a Harley, but I had a sport bike for a while and never was that crazy about it either.  I love my current bike, Triumph Tiger, a little sporty, a little cruiser, a little dual sport.  Best of everything.     Personally, I think the best way to learn is on a dual sport bike.  Its a dirt bike that is street legal.  If you drop it, no biggie.  It gets great MPG, really cheap to insure, and easy on fuel and easy to ride.
AA10568066	Sounds like the "new" battery is bad as well; its not that unusual if its been sitting on the shelf long (batteries not being rotated on store's shelf  older up front and newer behind - like milk in a grocery store). Take the battery back to the place you bought it and get it tested. Also, on the battery there should be a creation date of when it was made. If its more than six months the battery could have lost its charge sitting on the shelf.    Also, check the battery cables for corrosion (white flaking powder), especially under the red rubber cable end (positive cable). It can even be in the cable, it'll be swollen and deformed, when squeezed you'll hear a crunching sound. If you see corrosion take baking soda with a little bit a water using a small wire brush to brush away the corrosion. The baking soda neutralizes the battery acid (white flaking powder) you'll hear it sizzling. Let the caked on baking soda "stand" on the cables for between 5 - 10 minuets then wash it off with water very well. Also, do not to get it on your clothes or it will eat right through them.  You might even need to either replace the cable or cable ends if very severe (unlikely with only 4-5 yr old vehicle).    If this does not fix it. Take it to a shop; it could be a number of items from a simple wire short, bad starter solenoid to a computer problem.|`|AdlgOILYaa	You might have a bad alternator, in which case when the engine runs, it doesn't charge the battery like it supposed to.

It sounds to me like the leak is in the heater core.  If so, the leak would be towards the rear of the engine compartment.  If its towards the middle or front of the compartment, its a coolant line.

MH2Je94waa	My specialty.  As the other contributor said, you will need some heat if it is cold.  If the bike is fairly new, and it's not freezing in your area, it's possible the decals will come off without heat.  What you will need is a tool called a Li'l Chizzler.  You should be able to get one from a sign shop.  This will be one of your necessary tools. It's strong enough to peel and scrape, but not sharp enough to scratch.  Once you have the decal removed, use a good adhesive remover.  Solvent based stuff will hurt the paint.  There are many adhesive removers on the market.  I have a trick that I don't ever tell, but I doubt many people will see this post so I'm gonna spill it.  Go to a screen printing shop and ask if you can buy some "ink degradent" - maybe they'll give you some.  It's not cheap, but it works like no other.  I tried this stuff a few years back on a hunch and BINGO...you will not find anything better.  Put it in a spray bottle, spray it onto the bodywork lightly, let it sit for maybe 10 seconds and start wiping it off.  You are not going to believe how awesome this stuff works.  Follow it up with soapy water to get all the residue off and you are done.  And it won't damage your paint.  Just be sure to get all the excess off.    As for tank decals, most of them are clear coated over and you will need a professional to sand them off and repaint or touch up the tank.|`|72ddVB2iaa	Soften them with a blow dryer or a heat gun. Be patient and you will be able to pick them off without hurting the paint. When you are done, clean off the remaining adhesive with acetone or some other evaporative solvent.  I would just try the solvent on a  hidden spot before you try everywhere.|`|gUCMdP3Xaa	If your having problems with tank decals. It is because there is a clear coat sprayed over them. Asked a buddy in the body shop business and he said you can cut them out but will have a raised layer. He said basically sanding it down and repainting tank is whats done. There is a tool that Kawasaki used to sell and you might find it a body shop supply. It is a round piece of rubber like that of an eraser on a pencil. It attaches to your drill and rubs the decal away. This is perfect for side panels.

Remove and stow wire out of the way.   4) Remove strap or battery hold down clamp as needed.   5) withdraw old battery from compartment.   6) new battery should be filled to medium level (with acid if provided) - charged fully then topped to top line and charge topped off.   7) install new battery exact reverse of above  steps.  8) You should wear goggles and have water source nearby. batteries can sometimes explode for no apparent reason showering all nearby with acid.

I've gone to Autozone and the guys were willing to help me.|`|n1lZKTaYaa	If you have an aftermarket cold air intake you may not have a mass airflow sensor. It's possible that it was taken out. So you need to check the throttle body position sensor(rpm surge problem) or buy an aftermarket block-off for the mass air flow sensor b/c on the 2003 the mass air flow sensor ties in with the air intake.|`|70d2f7ef70343a918901da8717c7792caa	Chevy did a recall for the catalytic converter on the impalas.

If your maf sensor is bad, your check engine light should be on and your obd will have a code for the MAF.      Motor skills means knowing what to replace, not just how to replace it.  If you go replacing sensors without doing the diagnostic work first, you will spend yourself into oblivion.  If you still want to change it, buy the Haynes manual and follow the directions.
Gn0nR2S1aa	sure, knock yourself out.|`|fe896c388193778daefac15405693e34aa	Sure it can be done, but it will cost almost twice as much as just buying the actual Evo.

Durability, quality and reliability are all below average and the car was basically a "parts-bin" approach to vehicle development for Chevrolet.    I'm sure many good examples are on the market that have worked fine for many years but I assure you that you will have more issues with this vehicle over a span of time then you would if you chose a product from Honda or Toyota.    I'd expect the caprice to get high mileage based on it's design and drivetrain as would your average pick up truck.    I think you may find that a vehicle used for getting to work daily is a job best kept for vehicles that have a better reputation overall.  The top of that list does not include domestic products.

56f7791c16875200e7c89ce0bbaf53cbaa	Save your money. It won't help with the performance.  You would do better replacing the bad head gasket which always leaks oil down the back of the block, dripping on the exhaust system. All the 420a motors came from the factory with a poorly designed head gasket and they all will leak until replaced with the new metal layered gaskets.  Put an air intake and a cat back exhaust on the car if you want to hear the sound of "power". That may trick you into thinking you have a fast ride.|`|4b4d4f3bfe33461a02daa163629ada22aa	Absolutely no noticeable improvement in performance or economy by installation of an exhaust header on a 99 Eclipse used as a go to work car driven on public streets and roads.
kszkMlcXaa	what you should buy:    1) gauge pod  2) turbo kit  3) aftermarket exhaust (a 2.5 inch to 3 inch exhaust is fine)  4) engine management (if car doesn't come with one)    obviously, you dont know much about the subject. therefore, i suggest that you do not do anything before you gain some knowledge on this subject. go to the website i linked below, go to the forums section and then the engine mods. there is a huuuuuuge post about turbo's and how they work, etc. it tells you everything you need to know before going turbo. you need to know all the risks/consequences of installing a turbo in your car, because if installed improperly/tuned poorly, you run the risk of blowing up your engine. get some know how, and what mods you need. overall, depending on the kit, you will spend at LEAST $6k (including parts, install, tune, tax) so be prepared to fork over a good amount of money.    do not do what the guy above me said. superchargers for the tc are crap. made poorly, most blow up in the first couple of months. toyota designed the supercharger incorrectly, as the supercharger that would be most effective for the tc would not be a centrifugal one but a roots one.     oh and about voiding the warranty, he was wrong on that as well. toyota/scion states that if you install a part on your own and it is determined to be the cause of the problem, you will not be covered under warranty. but if you install something yourself that is aftermarket and then have a totally unrelated problem (i.e. install turbo kit and then your front seat heater breaks) your car is still covered under warranty. so don't be fooled when people say "it'll void your warranty" because they really don't know what they're talking about.|`|qeLikL8Haa	make sure your turbo kit has a nice size turbo for max efficiency on low boost and good inter-cooler this will save you a lot of money in the future    turbo-kits.com|`|hbanGS3Qaa	simple DONT DO IT  unless u got tons of cash and you dont know what to do with it.|`|ifqEXUxCaa	Stay away from the TRD supercharger it's JUNK.  Now if you want to build a fast car you can either sell your Scion and buy a used late model Mustang or something along those lines or keep your tC as a daily driver and buy used late model Mustang or something along those lines|`|2OcD9RH3aa	TRD sells supercharger kits for these. They are pricey but they don't void your warranty. That's probably your best choice as it is built and designed by toyota. However it will be expensive and if you want a turbocharger in your car that bad it's better to just buy something that's turbocharged from the factory and go about tuning it from there.    PS: The guys below is a show off. Toyota didn't design the supercharger bad. It's not the best supercharger in the world but it was designed by them. And it WILL be covered under the warranty. But like he said it's gonna be $6k, so do yourself a favor and buy a Subaru if you want a turbo car.
H9UjqBJIaa	double check the firing order to make sure you didn't cross a wire, the 50 you pulled out is from burn down wear, im sure they were 44 when installed,,44 should be fine,but if you re-gap the plugs and it still wont run rite you have a crossed wire or the wrong rotor or cap, double check ever thing thoroughly.|`|cc2b0d76cac98fbf61e197db52fde3caaa	call the parts store where you bought the plugs and ask them what the gap is for your vehicle before you take them out again and make sure you have your plug wires on correctly as it sounds like you have one crossed.|`|vGxr9e59aa	Plugs usually are gapped to 0.040 inch at the factory, and this setting works well for standard ignition coils.  If you replaced all the high voltage wires and are getting a weak spark, there's a chance that the coil is bad.  However, check the seating of the high voltage wire that goes between the coil and the distributor cap.  If either end isn't properly seated, you may have an inadvertent second spark gap under one of the insulator boots, effectively making the total gap that the current must jump 0.070 inch, or greater.  Likewise, check the seating of each of the plug wires, both at the plug and at the distributor cap.  If the boots are tight, especially with silicone dielectric grease on them, a cushion of air may form that makes it hard to push the wires all the way in.
HM4BAE18aa	This will all depend on who the insurance company deem responsible.  just because he collided with them doesn't mean he's in the wrong.Unless the car was stationary of course.The reason that your insurance company tell you not to admit liability at the scene of an accident is because you may be wrong.If the car pulled out from a side road for example and your brother broke but due to the ice continued and hit the vehicle it would still be the other drivers fault.In saying that without independent witnesses they would usually do  a 50/50 split.In these circumstances your brother would have to pay his excess but have his car repaired.If they find against him he will pay the excess but as he is not fully comprehensive they would not fix his car.|`|dyIyJqauaa	Of course he (or his insurance) is responsible.  I've never heard of trying to get the ice to pay for damages.|`|ym9bT5lmaa	Third party, fire and theft covers ONLY those aspects of the vehicle. A skid is generally described as 'driver error'.

Hackneys are like, pre ordered taxis . u can't just hop into them like u can a taxi. =] x|`|4d1ed0b771143afc8f21cd1ebe05d5c4aa	The term derives from London, where a taxi that can be hailed in the street by customers or wait for customers at a taxi rank must be registered with the Hackney carriage office. This does not apply to a pre-booked taxi (one where you phone up, and it comes to where you've agreed).    Therefore outside London the term usually refers to a taxi that can be hailed or picked up at a Taxi rank, as opposed to one that has to be pre-booked.|`|ym9bT5lmaa	In Victorian times, Hackney was (still is), the area of North-East London from which Hackney Cabs came from. A Hackney licence is issued by The London Carriage Office. The car as well as the driver are subject of very stringent testing standards. They are connected with the Metropolitan Police.

Nowadays, it Hackney Cab refers to those available only in the Greater London region.    The term Hackney is taken from the french haquene meaning a medium sized horse for lady riders.    An order for the first hackney carriages was placed in 1654 for the convenience of those finding it difficult or dangerous getting around the london streets and these Horse drawn carriages were used.|`|9XzxvLE5aa	Its basically a racialist term which means that immigrants are taking london taxi jobs.

They were horse drawn carriages and could be hired on the street.    The word "hackney" is derived from a French word for a medium-sized horse.    Through usage, the term hackney carriage became synonymous with any vehicle that could be hired on the street to transport passengers.    Hackney'd  now refers to any word or phrase that has lost its impact through overuse.    In Ireland, a Hackney Taxi is one which has to be booked by phone and can't be hailed in the street. In England, these are referred to as "minicabs".|`|9vmnr0iQaa	Hackney is a part of London, so if you live there then that might be it.|`|f167e988cf95e16dc2862de8ec651915aa	i belive it is a hackney carrige that can pick up any one anywhere,     where as you have a normal taxi you phone up and book,    or a hackney carrige looks more like a black london cab, we have white ones in leeds|`|SI02JOQ4aa	It comes from the type of carriage used when cabs were horse drawn.

Anyway I guess you've learned from your mistake and i've learned from yours too. ie you have to get insurance on a car before you even decide to buy it!|`|ym9bT5lmaa	At least you show contrition and regret. As one who has dealt many times with road traffic 'incidents' and far too often have to tell a next of kin about fatalities, I have no sympathy for uninsured drivers & riders.

There is NO situation that would excuse you from driving uninsured....NONE!|`|HM4BAE18aa	I've had the same problem with auctions in the past.Its alright if you got traders insurance you can drive away but normal people don't have.You cant insure the car before you get there because you don't know what your buying and if you pay for lorry transport to bring it back with you it cost as much as some cars.I  don't know why they don't offer one days insurance third party only for a nominal price at the auction house.Guess their not bothered.It wouldn't even take a lot to stick in a computer terminal so we could go on supermarket.com or the like and take the insurance out there and then.People say leave it there come back when your insurance is sorted which is okay if its local but I think if  there going to sell them to you they should help you sort out the insurance there. If a pub landlord serves you Drink when your drunk he can be fined .These auctioneers should get their house in order.|`|mKVFIklaaa	I answered your question to the best of my knowledge, but I'll have to put you straight on one thing: I would NOT be in your position - I buy cars at auction, but I wouldn't drive one home uninsured. It's just not worth it, as you've so recently found out.  People always break the law 'just this once' or 'in an emergency', but you've got to face the consequences afterwards.    Driving without insurance     Maximum fine: 5,000    Ban: Discretionary    Points 6-8    Michael D: Read your policy - chances are, you will only be covered on any other vehicle NOT owned by you, and also covered by it's own insurance policy.|`|lnUrm4sGaa	you just quite simply should not of driven the car it was stupid you should of asked some one to do for you who did have insurance|`|U3qTwOOIaa	well hopefully you have learned and won't do it again.

To do this, obtain a working 12 volt DC test light, hook it up between the battery negative cable and the battery negative terminal.  Observe the light, if it is lit, then you have a drain.  Depending on how brightly the test light is illuminated, it is also normal to have a very slight drain to power memory items in the car, clock, radio, etc.  Chances are a reading lamp in the 'C' pillar(s) has been left on, or maybe even the trunk or engine compartment light.  Hope this helps|`|c654465d22c58a2c5b0af285003b2789aa	It's hard to explain in a paragragh, but you need to disconnect the negative cable and put an amp meter between the negative battery post and the negative battery cable. .5 of an amp(1/2 an amp) will drain a battery overnight. In reality, it should read .0xx of an amp.   If it's .5 or higher, you need to pull fuses one by one until the draw go's away and it read's .0xx of an amp. Then you know atleast what circuit it's on.  Chances are, it's a glove box light, under hood light or trunk light staying on.    The 12v test light trick is sort of the same but from the stone age.|`|KTzBMxSeaa	also listen to hear if there's a random motor running.

cqIwDswVaa	they'll sue you just have a judgement against you till paid|`|IXtiKaOYaa	The fact that both of you have the same company (Geico) has no merit.  You have only $20K in coverage, which means your policy will pay up to or a maximum of 20k period.   The underinsured coverage is for this case in particular.  That means that your policy paid $20k and if I get what you said that they paid the other guy $600k, you owe $580k;;;;;;;;; the difference of 600k they paid and the 20k on your policy.    Underinsured picks up when someones policy does not have enough to pay their bills and pain/suffering.    $600k is a lot, which would mean that the other party most likely had a million in coverage, i would guess such as a commercial policy, and/or an a umbrilla policy.   Since you did not have enough coverage, they can go after you for the addtl amount they paid.  So if you own a home, car, savings, job, 401k, pension etc, you maybe filing bankruptcy.    Now if you own nothing, unemployed etc, they cant get anything.    GO TO A LAWYER;  FIND OUT YOUR RIGHTS.

e53807be9e34b50fae02ba7c73274c6baa	It totally depends on your situation and your priorities.   If you are saving for a house or have other things you want to acheive, another car payment will only hold you back from those goals.      From a strictly financial situation, if you haven't had any major problems with the Mustang, you are better off keeping it as long as possible.     If you really want a WRX, though, and you can afford a new set of car payments, then I would at least consider it.     Do you live an a climate with a lot of snow?  I know Mustangs are terrible in the snow and a buddy of mine is thinking of getting rid of his later this year because he doesn't want to go through another winter (Chicago, IL).     Only you can decide if this is the right choice for you, but take into consideration the following before making your decision:   your future goals in the next 5-7 years and how a new car payment will affect that, your credit and the interest rate, and the change in insurance rates.|`|6ZMebqRaaa	I think you should keep the mustang, but on the other hand WRX is more economical in terms gas.|`|ueuJNYOAaa	You need be cautious when going to trade in your ride to a dealership.

If you go with the 1.9 turbo diesel it's not gonna be a sports car by any means, but it will let you merge and pass on the freeway with the flow of traffic.  If you want a smaller engine then 1.9, go with a gas engine|`|zOIgzIy4aa	i would go with the 1.9 if i were you. anything smaller then you won,t have much power.|`|c48nm70gaa	Bea, Smaller is not necessarily less expensive or advisable. Diesels depend on torque (twisting & lugging energy) not high RPM horsepower. On an avarage most diesels have more cubic inches of displacement in a car or truck than gasoline engines. They often are much heavier. The the block, crankshaft, connecting rods, pistons, cylinder head  and associated fuel pump and injestors have "moor beef" because they operate under higher operating pressures and load.     Al average diesel engine has double or triple the life expencty as does a gasoline engine. 2/3 of all vehicles on Europe are diesels as the differntial cost of fuel isn't as great as in this highly taxed, highway robbery Democratic led Congress.|`|x8A8DnpPaa	you don't want anything smaller than a 1.9 - that's freaking tiny.|`|vaacRAi0aa	I know you can get a 1.4 diesel, but I think that's the smallest for VW (Lupos are also 1.4). Otherwise, get a 1.0 petrol one. If you insist on a diesel you can get other cars with a 1.3 engine ie. Corsa. I wouldn't advise it though.

AA11535912	First clean the damper pully.(crankshaft).You will see a line cut into it.Mark this line with white paint stick or chalk.The sticker under your hood will tell you how many degrees before top dead center it shoul fire on.Mark this line as well on the marker located above the damper pully.Disconnect the vacuum line to the distributor and plug it.Start the car.Useing a timing lite, aim it at the timing marks.If they don't match exactly,loosen the distributor and turn it slightly to advance or retard the timing till the marks match.Good luck.|`|AA11454695	i believe the only way you are gonna get that information is a trip to the library...good luck  try     www.autozone.com .........  ya just never know....|`|b74c92f2ddadeca5dee74b48665985b8aa	There's two ways to check the timing on a car.  Luckily, a '59 will be easy as there's less electronic stuff to get in the way.    You'll need a shop manual for the exact settings and procedures.  Local libraries often have sets you can examine.    The first way is static timing.  You need a test light, which you connect across the points in the distributor.  Disconnect the coil lead, so that the engine won't start, and turn on the ignition. Then you carefully turn the engine over until the points open and the light comes on.  At that point, look at the crank pulley and the pointer should show the static engine timing.    The second way is dynamic timing with the engine running.  This takes into account mechanical and vacuum advance/retard to the timing settings.  You'll need a timing strobe light that you can get for about $20 at any car parts place, or Sears.  You hook the power leads to the battery, and clip the sensor lead around the  1 spark plug wire.  When the light senses that the plug is firing, it triggers the light.  Start the engine, aim the light at the crank pulley and you'll see that the pulley appears stationary, with the pointer indicating the current timing setting.    You may need to rub something like chalk or white shoe polish into the markings to make them more visible.    If the setting appears to jerk back and forth seemingly at random, it can be a sign that your distributor shaft is worn and the timing is not stable.    WARNING!  Working in the engine compartment with the engine running is DANGEROUS, especially around the front of the engine where the fan is.  Be very careful.  If you're not comfortable with this, just pay a pro.|`|AA10139993	With a strobe light gun and then look for the markings. Make sure set at zero, look for the numbers.  If you can't see the numbers clean the crank shaft pulley.|`|AA11348785	What scares me the most is the stupid answers you get on this site.  First check for a timing mark on your crank shaft pulley.  Then check for a guide that should be near it.  Looks like a little plate with numbers on it.  Kind of sticks out about an inch or two.  That plate should have numbers on it.  Numbers with + or - by them.  OK, now that you've found that,get a timing light.  Looks like a little gun that has three wires coming off of it.  The probe end goes around number 1 spark plug wire and the others go to the battery.  Start the car and point the light at the little plate.  You should see a line (the mark on your crank pulley) that is lining up with those numbers.  Very lightly loosen the bolt that hold the distributor down.  Maybe just 1/4 to 1/2 turn.  You might want to do this before you start the car.  OK car running, distributor loose, turn the distributor slightly to get that line to +6.  When there, turn car off.  Tighten the bolt and you are done.  Oh yeah, one more thing.  Take the vacuum line off the distributor before you start.  That will throw this hold process off.  Don't forget to put it back on when you are done.  Hope this helps.

AA11535912	O.K. I'll sort out the answers for you. If you have not lost any coolant from your radiator,that is your car is not over heating,then the drain hose for your a/c system is plugged.It will start to mildew and that will cause the bad smell.If it is the heater core,you will notice a loss of antifreeze from the overflow container under the hood.On the pass. side of the car,low on the firewall,you will find a small hose comming thru.Use a long flexible wire(pipe cleaners are good for this)push it into the hose and clear the clog.            problem solved!|`|8771f02f7ab9dc562f8366a23152c4efaa	Sounds like your heater core went out.

It should be a green or red color, or it could be brown if you don't take care of the car.

I know you may need to save money by doing it yourself, but messing with something you don't know about, usually ends up costing you twice as much in the long run.  Better to leave this to a mechanic, as he would have all the tools needed.  Besides tools are expensive, and someone trying to straighten out what you messed up will cost you dearly!  You might be able to tune on it with a basic tool set like the $120 mechanics set that sears has on special.  It's a good set, and had most of the basic stuff you might need for doing plugs, wires, cap & rotor.  Thats really all you need to do to it.  Do yourself a favor and put the same plugs in it that comes in it, and stay away from those high dollar plugs that don't do any better or last as long as what comes in it.  Don't try to adjust anything like the timing, the injector system, or idle speed, as all of this is don't by the computer now.  Do not try to take the sprk plugs out of a warm engine or you can damage the head.  Work on a cold engine with stuff like that.

As long as the tire isn't otherwise damaged, you can plug it.|`|08d9cbd85b93f9fa1fbbd76fa701a447aa	It is not a good idea to EVER plug a punture in any tire especially a radial type tire and here's why.    A radial tire's cords (the tire's skeleton) run from bead to bead or across the tire, then another layer is added just under the tread.  A radial tire is designed to flex such as when cornering for traction.  This flexing causes a tire to warm up, much like bending a coat hanger back and forth.  If you bend the coat hanger back and forth then put your hand on the area where it was flexing, it's quite hot. Same with a tire when it flexes!  When a plug is put into a puncture site, the possibility of  getting hot and coming loose or coming out completely becomes very real.  If the plug comes out, say at 70MPH, the massive deflation could cause you to lose control of your car.    Most reputable tire dealers will NOT plug ANY tire for this very reason.  They dismount the tire and place a patch on the inside of the tire provided the puncture is on the tread area and not the sidewall.  Since a tire contains air pressure inside, the air pushes against the patch inside the tire making the repair even stronger when the tire is reinflated.  Plus, when a patch is applied, the rubber inside the tire is scuffed and so the patch is applied to "new rubber."  A plug, on the other hand is applied to old rubber which does not allow the plug to vulcanize (the chemical bonding of two seperate pieces of rubber) properly which further increases the possibility that a plug may come loose or come out.    Go for the patch!

AA10087435	From what you're describing, you have a "bead leak" which means that the seal between the tire and the rim is not sealed tightly.  If this is the case, often, depending on which are of the tire the car is actually parked on the pressure on the area of the rim that is not sealed correctly can cause more or less air to leak out.  I'd get it to a place that can unseat the tire from the rim and re-seal the whole thing, just make sure they re-ballance the tire when they do it.  Hope this helps.

Driving at slow speed means less fuel and the sediment doesn't clog the filter.  As you speed up, you consume more fuel and the sediment can clog the filter because more fuel causes pressure inside the filter as it is trying to pass through.    Trust me, its cheap and easy to replace.
