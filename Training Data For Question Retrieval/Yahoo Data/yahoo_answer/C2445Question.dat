I was bored and decided to write this poem based on previous experiences.Don't worry it may be a bit rough seeing as i wrote it within 5 minutes.      The emptiness inside of me    stings like a thorn   ripping my soul out    from dusk till dawn.      People stare at me   as though im not like them   They dont really know me   or what was left of me      They dont understand how i feel   how possibly could they know   My emotions are in shreds   and i dont know what to feel      i try to keep my head down   hoping they wont notice   the tears rolling down my cheeks   the sorrow in my heart      im afraid to put my hand up in class   in fear that they will hear   the shakiness in my voice   the sadness in my heart      Why do they all choose me?   to pick on everyday   its got to the point   where my name puts fear in me      is there something wrong with me?   Do i look a mess?   do i hang around with the wrong people   do i need to impress?      I sit on the floor   head upon my knees   hoping time will pass me by   and it will all be over      i do try my hardest   to push away the sadness   but everytime i do   it just makes it worse      I have no identity   they stole all that   and they replaced it   with hurt cutting in deep      i have no cuts or scars   or signs of abuse   the most damage has been done   inside my precious mind      Luckily thing have improved   yet the mental scars are yet to heal   i have my friends close by me   and the bullys have gone their seperate ways         The end :)      sorry for bad grammer etc pure lazyness :)

Another way of looking at my question is, what if some Greater Power placed you here but needed to make you think you have a life so it created other living things around you to build cars, computers, buildings, so on and so on.... Otherwise, if you were entirely alone here on this planet then you would die prematurely from loneliness...Right?      So what do you think?

She whispered in my ear.  "This time he must be stopped.  Check the cellar, the small closet, you know what I mean."  And with that my spy resumed folding laundry with a placid expression.  I knew who she meant - who else but my father in this place is insane?   I heard the screams before I came into the cellar.  Not my father's screams, not anyone I knew.  I flung open the door to the closet and almost closed it.     My father was there, but he wasn't alone.  A girl, about my age was with him.  Blood was running down her face, her arms, it was everywhere.  He held a knife in his hands, his expression gleeful.  He turned and saw me.  And then he smiled, that cruel smile that I would never get used to.     "I am having vengeance on your mother's death."  He proclaimed.  Then he turned to the girl, who tried desperately to scoot out of his way.  He grabbed her neck with his thick, gloved hands.  When he dropped her her strange white hair flew around her.     White hair.  I knew who this was.

20090223104951AAGyRKH	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Mathematical formula used to work out human rights paradoxes?	Hello      Could you use maths to try and work human rights paradoxes.   Some examples of paradoxes are below...      I have a right to free expression, but I do not have a right to use verbal abuse, slander, deformation of character and so on.      It is deemed to be illegal in the UK to tape record abuse, because you have to ask the persons permission, even though that defeats the object of recording abuse as evidence like all forms of evidence.      Euthanasia is legal in some countries because a person has the right of free choice, but some worry that God may have overruled it.  But there is no proof of God and not prove of overrule if there is a God.      You should not spank your children, but some say that is how to get them to behave.      If each situation was assigned a letter and a function, using logical argument that involves algebraic equations, one could work out what the correct moral conduct would be in the abuse examples.   Although, it would not stop abuse, or stop people being critical of such maths for what ever reason, which may be bases on propaganda.      How could this be done?      CREED

20090223105907AAHjgd5	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Would you be weirded out by this if you read this in a book? (PLEASE READ?)?	I decided it would make my story more interesting if one of the two main character females is actually bisexual and has a secret cruch on the other main female character.      Of course this would never be official and I would just hint at it through out the book but i figure it would make it more interesting and would make their relaitonship more real.      They're supposed to be rivals turned best friends then back to enemies again (the more bad *** one is the bisexual one i think)      anyways would you be a little weirded out if you picked up on a hint of this and drop the book or would you be like "huh interesting!" and keep reading?       it is in no way the main plot of the book (there's only some romance and it's between the straight female lead and a guy who is actually a bad guy who is just using her woo!)      so yeah i thought it would be cool to have some interesting "deeper relationship" between two girls even if it's one-sided (i personally love unrequited love, jealousy, etc in books)       so would you be weirded out if you happened to pick up the hints and drop the book, or would you focus on the actual story and think huh that's kind of interesting cool?       it would be subtext       the story would be told from the point of view of the straight girl (because the other girl is more mysterious and the story IS more focused on the straight girl because of her family)      so it would be fun to describe how the first girl is confused as to why her frenemy is acting weird or not trusting any guys etc etc,      they'd be very close during the friendship time though.

20090223105802AAOKGxa	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	What are some philosophical reasons not to commit suicide?	What are some philosophical reasons not to commit suicide?      Sociobiology teaches that a certain set of egotistical, selfish values remain with us from antiquity and will continue to be cavemen. Certainly the insanity of this Second Great Depression seems to confirm the selfish war of all against war that hides behind the facade of law, civilization and morality. And look at male-female relations. With all the complaints of "political correctness" walk into any college fraternity or bar and cavemen ethics still rule.      Schopenhauer said we were in the worst of all possible worlds. If any worst it could not exist as mass suicide would follow. Instead an irrational will to live which we could not control forces us to go on with our wretched lives until we commit the sin of parenthood and sentence another generation to the hell of existance. Sex is the tool the WIll uses to ensure the survival of this hell.       So if there is no rational reason for living, and if one rejects the values of sociobiology and the times, then what is the philsophical argument against suicide?

20090223131848AAu2iZs	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What do you think?  To long, or okay for subject?  Critiques are welcomed.?	The Face      Why now, you may ask of me.  Why dredge up past things?   Well, a photograph started it all and that is why now...   Get a hot drink, or cold if you prefer, and sit back and see him...      He stood for an hour that day watching nothing, or;   I could tell by his face that what he saw was a story,   maybe one only he could tell.  Should I interrupt this   memory he lives, standing there, watching?      Lost chance.  He walked away holding his head high   unashamed of the tear stains on his face.  I smiled   as he walked by, he seems not to notice.  I get up   to follow----something holds me back.      I wander through this small town aimlessly.  My    thoughts on the man.  Where is he, is he alone,   is he lonely...all this clutters my mind.  I slowly    head for home thinking:  Resolution!  I WILL go to   that field and I WILL ask him to share.      I was faithful to my resolve.  Every day for a week I   went to that field and waited--longed to see the man,   he did not return.  Melancholy hit me; I wandered    the streets wondering if this was crazy.  How long   do I wait?      I stumbled upon a little coffee counter and decided   coffee was needed.  Making sure I had enough    change, I ordered a cup, black.  The girl, she was    older than me but her stature and personality, girl,    poured the hot juice into a thick, well worn but    sturdy mug.      She told me I looked as if the world were on my shoulders.   I told her I was looking for a man that I had seen in    the field many times, might she know him or...the look   on her face stopped me.  She told me he was her dad   and that he passed a week ago.      In talking, we found that I was the last to see him alive.   She said he hadn't stopped by for his cup of 'joe' that day   and when she went by he hadn't answered the door.   She did errands and when she came back, she used   the spare key and found him...      She and I met every day for a couple of weeks to talk   of him.  She shared her dad with me and I 'adopted' him   as my grandpa I never knew.  I had taken a photo of him   the first time I saw him in the field.  There was something   about him that made me take it.  When I got it developed   on the back I simply put "The Face".      He was a soccer player as a young college man and that   field is where they practiced and played.  He met his   wife there, a shy beauty that "took his breath away".   He mustered up the nerve one day to ask her for a    coffee at the counter and she accepted.  They never   parted.      They married and had one daughter, the waitress.  He    always told his wife that one child was enough and that   she was a girl was fine with him.  When she was a few   months old, he hired a girl to come by once a week after   school to babysit.  He took his wife for walks and they   always wound up at the field and relived the memories   together.      They had a simple life and all was well.  He and his daughter   had a falling out when she married a man he did not approve    of.  He gave her away at the wedding and then walked out.   They didn't speak for 16 years.  Her husband died the year   before her mom got sick and mom had told her dad would   come around, give him time.      He called her at work to tell her mom was in the hospital.   They tag-teamed sitting with her for a week, only saying   hello to each other in passing.  At her grave, he had taken   his daughters hand in his and the flood gates opened.  They   embraced and all was forgiven.      He had made a scrapbook of photos, news clippings and    the like since he had met his wife.  He was waiting to give   it to her when she took ill.  He shared it with her in that    final week but he never forgave himself for not sharing it   sooner.  How her love lingered in his heart, heavy burden   to always wonder...   ...........Lingering      Standing on the sidelines   something he rarely did   a smile peaks through the pain   "Oh, to have those days again!"      He spoke the words aloud to no one at all   She would be here waiting in the shadows   celebrating the victory alone   content to be mine her prize      A tear falls down his face    tracking where others came before   never sorry for loss of youth   but she was more than life      Did she know how much...?      This is my memory of the face.  I can't recall the names.   I pass them on to you, as they were passed on to me.   Remember his devotion to her until his dying day.  The    scrapbook was given to me the day I moved away.  No    names, but the faces remain...

Possible solution - In the NaNoWriMo forums, they have "novel swaps", an opportunity for writers to share their novels with a fellow writer for critique, advice, etc.       I am sorely tempted to subject some poor soul to reading my first draft because I don't know what else to do. There's no way I'm showing it to anyone I know in real life, so would you recommend the novel swap?       If not, give me some alternate solutions, please. I need direction and don't know where to find it.      Thanks!

20090223124039AA1EuIk	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Do you think U.S. citizens became greedier after 9/11 instead of more spiritual and moral?	I thought for sure after 9/11 when people were grieving that they would be introspective and they would take a step back and take a look at their values and their spiritual condition. I basically thought they would get nicer in general. I thought they would help other people out. But it seems as if that sentiment only lasted for a few months. I think people got greedier and they ran up tons of debt. George W. Bush's solution to the whole thing after 9/11 was to start killing people in more overseas wars. He also told the nation to go shopping. Do you remember that? And boy, did they ever go shopping. Corporations became even greedier too if that's even possible. Trying to make a quick buck, they wrote tons and tons of sub-prime loans after 9/11 and the speculation on Wall Street was at an all-time high. Which leads to the current situation. People simply got too greedy and they looked out for #1 too much until it got to a breaking point and then the whole economic system collapsed.  Why did people get worse after 9/11 rather than better? What in the hell happened? It is as if people got more shallow. The rampant consumerism and celebrity worship got worse instead of better.
20090223125621AAbFwM7	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What do you think of my poem?	The preditior becomes the prey,   The hunter will be hunted.   From when disaster strikes,   We will not be far.   The world will collapse,   As we grow with power.   Soliders dying quickly,   Opinion from perspective,   We will live in regret.   Silently dying, all alone.      You may think it's a strange poem. But it's my style

20090223125257AAiVzdZ	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	I know it isn't the season for this but i wonder if you like a good dark read?	THE THREAT REMAINS         Curse this rising staring sphere,    Orb unblinking stealing night!    And to the shadows we disappear,    While mortals bask in the blaring light.    So indifferent, souls sick and unsure,    As their star burns and blisters the skin of our kind.    We have made a vow of hatred forevermore    To stalk them from this dark cloak that we skulk behind.       Midnight tolls it's deep bass hour;    Graves open like cerrenial nightshade flowers.    Seraphim, now fallen from heaven's grace,    Arise, ravenous, vicious; pale of face.    They link swiftly down silent alleys,    Slipping into open windows,    They wait beside trails    In the plush long-grassed meadows,    Seeking only to sate the ever-yawning hollow.    The only sustenence is found in the dying    Of the one whose blood they swallow.    Too soon that hunger will return,    Painfull, intense; persistent.    Taking human lives as prey    In one fatal instant,    Within which the elusive    And unfathomable soul    Are theirs... thus filling    That gaping, hungry hole...       ...And the fiends commit to slumber,    Submitting to the spell they are under.    Into basement, sarcophagus, chasm,    Where, all men know, the Devil has them    Locked in a dream of woven thorn-vines    Unable to wake as long as the sun shines.       The sound of a pendulous winged creature hitting ground    Breaks the solemn silence of the sleepy little town.    Children whimper fretfully from vague, unsettled dreams,    And are startled into wakeful terror by nearby unholy screams.    Something perhaps lurks there behind that half-closed door,    Perhaps leaving crimson puddles in splothes on the floor.    Invisible but for the bloody trail of footprints left behind them,    They carry off the innocent to a place no one will find them.       Sleep for now in peace, child- have nary a care,    The sun rises fast- tonight your life is spared.    But know this: we will come again,    On the wings of a wild windstorm;    Immortal, unyielding, fearsome and hellborne.    Curses upon every one of your souls,    Hiding like mice in your little cubby-holes.    Deadbolts, chainlocks, security systems,    Will never stop us from the taking of our chosen victims.    Warding spells, holy relics, chanting, churchyards, charms-    Won't save you from our rage as long as your blood is warm.    For as long as that fluid pumps through human veins,    The fear will rise in all men                                       yes, the threat remains...            ? 2009

20090223125345AA84kEb	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	How many of you are REALLY happy with your life?	I really do not know what my problem is but I am at a point in my life where I feel like it has no meaning or purpose.  My job bores me to tears, my home life is extremely routine and I'm just stuck in a rut, a very blah feeling.  I am taking steps to improve this feeling by going back to school and changing the career that I am currently in to one that has a daily change in scenery, I also started going back to the gym but there is this emptiness that I can't explain or even understand.  I know deep down that there are choices we all make and I can be happy or sad, I definitely choose happy but in the pit of my stomach this sadness lingers.  I'm even kind of ashamed to write this because I have a beautiful family and I really am thankful for all that God has given and taken away but the sadness or the feeling that makes me feel like I am nothing but a robot just continuing my daily routine life and chores is really starting to get to me.  Any useful/heartfelt advice would really be greatly appreciated
20090223125713AA84zfB	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Hope...how do we get it?

Thanks in advance.

Hi, i'm 15 and this is my second time writing any kind of poetry, so really, I'm not sure if the way i'm writing it is completely horrid or not. What do you think of it? Is there any way I could improve it?      It's called, "Jeans".         No, love, there is no oxygen on the moon   Take your jeans off   Feel obliged to use the last of the cash in your pocket   Unzipping this mask of burden is free      Use the hands chocking in those pockets   And attempt to rip your odious fads   Strum the last remains of the ominous threads   To elicit a new sense of awareness   Into that oxygen deprived wardrobe      Don't forget to scribble out the tiny hearts   That pen on your legs   No one will notice in this vast ocean   Do you prefer dark or faded this time?   Suffocating is wedged between both pairs      Now hold on to the leather seat tighter, my dear   It's not uncanny to wait with an extra pair   For this space shuttle is going to rush   Though the darkest area of space seems to be close   If not already here      It's not eerie that the sky is blue   However it is weird that jeans come in different hues   These blinding shades darken your declining sense   Leave this quarantine   And take your jeans off

20090223123813AAKVdcY	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	What do you think of my philosophy?	I don't believe in anything. Nothing exists.         It's the ultimate oxymoron. I don't even believe in believing.            This is why...         If you go back in the beginning of time, you'll find out, there was no time.   If you go foward in the end of time, you'll find out there was no time.   If you think about it, time doesn't even exist.      The past, present, or future don't exist. We don't exist.      The universe is so big. But it could be so small. Imagine the universe the size of atoms. Now, imagine our existence.      There is no difference between reality and fantasy.      Zero is a number. Zero means nothing. And if nothing is something, then something is nothing.       What we see, hear, smell, touch, and taste only "works" because we live in "this" world. If the universe is so big (or small), imagine "another" world that disproves the laws of physics, math, and science. Therefore, 1 + 1 = 2 might mean 1 + 1 = 8 in another world.      What if there is no "other" world? Okay....What if there is no world at all? What if this world doesn't exist?         There is no way of proving you exist.       There is no after life. There is no before life. Therefore, there is no life itself.      There is no god, no heaven, no hell, no earth, no life.            Nothing exists.

Every event must have a cause separate from itself   2. In order for a cause to exist it has to be a part of an endless sequence of events.   3. It is not viable for a sequence of endless events to exist.   Conclusion 1:  Something must cause itself to exist or be uncaused   Conclusion 2:  Thus God exists

Teresa Neves needs to put the pressure on her son Ronald Cummings to tell the truth. He is a lier! He told Geraldo he has never sold drugs, did drugs or been arrested for drugs. That is a lie! Putnam County Sherrifs department where I guess Teresa Neves is employed (She wore a coat with sherrifs logo while doing a tv interveiw) I guess she was representing her self as The Sheriffs department that day) anyway... The Putnam CO Sherrifs department said they had no comment on Ronald Cummings prior arrests, as they did not want to embarrass anyone. Embarass who? Uhhh Teresa Neves? OR Ronald Cummings? And if its Ronalds since when do we not embarrass criminals? I am also concerned over the lie detector tests? Were they really done? The state police and FBI should get involved so they can monitor the situation. I just think that maybe these people may be bias. Let their be justice for Haliegh Cummings. She was born to loser Hillbillies druggies dont let them get away with it if they hurt her. Take that other child out of the home and away from that loser family - all of them before he gets hurt.

20090223135859AAhAHUB	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Short and to the point poem.  Good?	The letter “D”.    It can change an entire word.   Take the word “Love” in all of it’s glory.   If you are in Love, you may care more about someone than you ever will for yourself.   Add a simple “D” to that, and now you no longer do.   That feeling simply drifts away into cold nothingness.   And most of the time, all we want to get rid of, is   The letter “D”.

If you like this, I have a profile on writerscafe.org. Kameron Armitage. I would love for anyone to e-mail me what you think:) thank you very much:)            It's painful to see.      Your love for him growing stronger.      None given to me.      Can't grasp this much longer.            Not me.      It's him.      This hurt will never drift.      Can't get.      What I thrive.      Love is not a gift.            I am seeing a never ending Mirage.      As I continue to chase you, with no chance of success.      The only thing that love attracts is distress.            Yet I welcome it.      As if it is wanted.      And now I cannot forget.      And I am still being haunted.            Please, set me free.      Rejecting.      Accepting.      That's all that I need.            But one thing I won't do.      Is leave without trying.      I need to either be with you.      Or get closer to dying.            Although it may hurt, I will thank you deeply.      Because all that I want, is for you to see.      The real me.      Who truly.      Loves thee.      With one last plea.      Please set me free.

20090223133611AAje3oV	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Writing a short story but... gah! Help!?	I've got a seedling of an idea, and I'm really excited about writing it... but it takes place in the early 1700's and I really have no idea what normal, everyday life was like back then. I know the stereotypical lifestyle, the threat of indians, etc... but it all seems so shallow, since I'm not knowledgeable about regular people's lives in that particular time period in the US. I want to get this story down on paper, because it's been rattling my head too long already (and because I'm supposed to have at something for my class on Thursday)...      Should I...      1) Just get the story out of my head and on paper, even with the semi-cliche lifestyle. If I have time, or if it becomes important to the story, I'll research what I need to about the late 1600s and early 1700s and incorporate new details into my second draft.      or      2) Research before I start writing. Maybe through research my story will take a different turn because of some interesting factoid I learn about... but I also might not find anything interesting that affects the root of my story... I'll also be pressed for time to complete what I need by Thursday      What do you guys think? I love your opinions, however experienced or inexperienced you may be. I'm confident that I can create a fairly good story either way, but I'm concerned that I don't know enough to make the story sound real... I'm also concerned about putting off writing the story, since I've already been thinking about it a lot and have procrastinated starting the actual writing of it.      Thanks in advance! :D

Uh well we have an assignment to write a four line metaphor poem in which lines 1 and 2 rhyme and lines 3 and 4 rhyme. My topic was dogs.

Anyways, if anybody could help me think of something to compare dogs to it would be very helpful.      Please don't think i am asking you to do my hw for me. I just got stuck. I don't want you to write me a poem, I just need something to compare a dog to that i could write a 4 line poem on.       Thank you very much =)

20090223143331AABL6m9	Arts & Humanities;Theater & Acting	Have you seen 'Green grow the Lilacs?'?	I was doing research on Agnes De Mille and found she choreographed Oklahoma or 'Green grow the rushes' as it was sometimes called. However it's true name is 'Green grow the lilacs'. This is based on a folk song, but a South American one too, and Green Grow is in fact 'Gringo'. Has anyone see the play?   Here is some stuff I researched.   Green Grow the Lilacs (play)   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   Green Grow the Lilacs is a 1931 play by Lynn Riggs named for the popular folk song of the same name.[1] It was performed 64 times on Broadway, opening on January 26, 1931 and closing March 21, 1931. It also shown January 19, 1931 through January 24, 1931 at the National Theatre in Washington D.C. It was produced by the Theatre Guild and directed by Herbert J. Biberman. Rather startlingly, the debonair, ultrasophisticated actor Franchot Tone portrayed cowboy Curly. June Walker was seen as his sweetheart Laurey. Theatre Guild board member Helen Westley, who had appeared as Mrs. Muskat in the original Broadway production of Ferenc Molnar's Liliom, played Aunt Eller. Lee Strasberg, later to become a renowned teacher of method acting, played the part of the Persian peddler. The play also toured the Midwest , and was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.[2] For example, it appeared at the Dallas Little Theatre during the week of March 7, 1932, and again in Dallas at the Festival of Southwestern Plays, on May 10, 1935..[3] Although the 1943 Rodgers and Hammerstein musical play Oklahoma! used a new score rather than the old folk songs in Riggs' work, the story of the play is mostly very similar, except for the ending, which unlike that of the musical, is left rather undecided as to Curly's trial for accidentally killing farmhand Jeeter (Jud in the musical). [2] In addition, the cowboy Will Parker is only referred to in the original Riggs play; he does not actually appear in it. Therefore, the entire comic subplot involving the fifty dollars that Will must obtain in order to be able to marry Ado Annie is an invention of Hammerstein's.

20090223134442AAKZoFh	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is there any academic conjecture as to whether Lord Tennyson was bisexual?	I've always read the poets of the Romantic era, and recently while reading an older book (ca. 1965) which had a short biography on Tennyson, it occurred to me that he might have been bisexual.      While this is no judgment on the man, who was and remains one of the most brilliant poets of English language, it is of note that he spent a good portion of his younger life with a friend named Arthur Hallam, upon whose death Tennyson was devastated. He did marry after the death, at the age of forty. It is just a question, however, and open to whatever you may wish to include.      No, this is not homework, before someone presumes it is. This is just something I noticed while reading "The Lady Of Shalott" for class, and wondered where there was academic conjecture on it o what opinions might be.

20090223134133AANurjD	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	What are some philosophical reasons not to commit suicide?	What are some philosophical reasons not to commit suicide?      Sociobiology teaches that a certain set of egotistical, selfish values remain with us from antiquity and will continue to be cavemen. Certainly the insanity of this Second Great Depression seems to confirm the selfish war of all against war that hides behind the facade of law, civilization and morality. And look at male-female relations. With all the complaints of "political correctness" walk into any college fraternity or bar and cavemen ethics still rule.      Schopenhauer said we were in the worst of all possible worlds. If any worst it could not exist as mass suicide would follow. Instead an irrational will to live which we could not control forces us to go on with our wretched lives until we commit the sin of parenthood and sentence another generation to the hell of existance. Sex is the tool the WIll uses to ensure the survival of this hell.       So if there is no rational reason for living, and if one rejects the values of sociobiology and the times, then what is the philsophical argument against suicide?

I am writing a book and this girl goes up stares to her attic to escape her siblings and finds a trunk. When she realizes there is a name written on it that belongs to no one in her family she opens it. She finds a robe, and then realizes that there is something under the fabric and pulls it out. She finds another box and pules it out. It is an old metal box with runes carved into it. they  are written by different people (different family members). She opens it and finds... Insense, a wand, a knife (an athame), jewelry (talismans, amulets), a necklace (pentagram), dried herbs, rocks, cords, candles, 4 bowls (elements), a bell, a cup (chalice, goblet), crystal ball, another knife (boline) and chalk. Everything has symbols on it. She goes back to the chest and finds more fabric, and a broom (besom), a cauldron, and a book. She also finds a book of shadows, her mothers. I was wondering if there is anything I am missing or should take out. What happens is her biological mother died when she was young and the father was not known. She was adopted but never told.

20090223144647AA4ZExP	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Self publishing my novel?	I wrote a novel and its about 60,000 words. I am currently working with an independent editor and when the book is finished, it will be closer to 70,000 words.       Its a dark, sadistic, psychological thriller with gruesome murders, violence, abuse, blood and guts.      I know thats a lot to take in. But, I am thinking that self publishing my book (in this case) would be a better idea because of the content of the book. I know there are many books written with some of the same content (published by big companies), but they are written by more mature authors.      I live in Portland and I am currently looking into Greenleaf and Peanutbutter Publishing.      Has anyone self published a book with either? or somewhere else? What was the outcome? thanks.

20090223144102AA1M71T	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What is the moral of this poem?	i have to write a response on the moral of this peice.  I'm having a tough time putting it into words any help would be greatly appricated    :)         the glove and the lions      King Francis was a hearty king, and loved a royal sport,   And one day, as his lions fought, sat looking on the court.   The nobles filled the benches, with the ladies in their pride,   And 'mongst them sat the Count de Lorge, with one for whom he signed:   And truly 'twas a gallant thing to see that crowning show,   Valor and love, and a king above, and the royal beasts below.      Ramped and roared the lions, with horrid laughing jaws;   They bit, they glared, gave blows like beams, a wind went with their paws;   With wallowing might and stifled roar they rolled on one another,   Till all the pit with sand and mane was in a thunderous smother;   The bloody foam above the bars came whisking through the air;   Said Francis then, "Faith, gentlemen, we're better here than there."      De Lorge's love o'er heard the King, a beauteous lively dame,   With smiling lips and sharp bright eyes, which always seemed the same;   She thought, The Count my lover is brave as brave can be;   He surely would do wondrous things to show his love of me;   King, ladies, lovers, all look on; the occasion is divine;   I'll drop my glove, to prove his love; great glory will be mine.      She dropped her glove, to prove his love, then looked at him and smiled;   He bowed, and in a moment leaped among the lions wild:   The leap was quick, return was quick, he has regained his place,   Then threw the glove, but not with love, right in the lady's face.   "By Heaven," said Francis, "rightly done!" and he rose from where he sat;   "No love," quoth he, "but vanity, sets love a task like that."             -- James Leigh Hunt

20090223105832AAnYDub	Arts & Humanities;Theater & Acting	Themes for rewriting Romeo and Juliet?	I was recently assigned a project where I have to rewrite an act of Romeo and Juliet in a different theme. I was assigned to do Act 4 in a country western theme. My group and I had a difficult time rewriting it that way, so we need a different theme.      Here are the other themes that are already taken, so don't suggest these: the eighties, gangsters and the mob, and hip hop.

I cant seem to find out who the artist is or where I can find a print. I seem to remember it being called "After The Storm" but I am not 100% sure if that sit. I found it once online but the artshop no longer was in business. Its I believe chalk but could be oil and it shows a few sheep at the base of a green hill and the clouds look kind of gray and stormy. Any ideas?
