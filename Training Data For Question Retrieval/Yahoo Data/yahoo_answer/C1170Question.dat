And i could probably find most of that at y goodwill. But, um, would it look good on me? I'm 13 years old, around 5'9, and i weigh around...212 pounds. So i was wondering would i look like an ***, or should i lose some weight?And, how could i lose some weight? Fast!? So i guess this isa separate question. How can someone my age lose weight really fast? Thanks.

20081004182926AAt7Suq	Beauty & Style;Hair	Does your first gray hair "grow in" or does it turn most of the grown out strand gray?	I'm 20 and my hair is about about 7 inches past my shoulder. I woke up this morning and noticed a very light strand (my hair is dark). I noticed it gets much darker as it goes down, at around my shoulder.       I don't know if this is a gray hair, or a result of the "ultra pale blonde highlight" conditioner I've been using for less than a week, but I think were it a gray hair I'd have noticed it sooner? Which is why I ask if when you get your first gray hair, do you see it grow in or does it turn most of the strand gray?

When I was younger all the kids said they wanted to be things like doctors. I went around "thinking" I would be a model just like Cindy Crawford. My mom use to laught at me because I'd always look at fashion magazines. Now I'm turning 16, mailed my pictures off. One agencie already denied me. Oh, and just if some of you are wondering I KNOW that I can't do catwalk. My height is a major factor, but there are other types of modeling... I really need to think of a new career for myself. I'm really into fashion and make-up. My mom is a make-up artist, but I really don't think I want to do that. Ugh, I might as well start flipping burgers.

The under layer, right above my neck has big curls. And the hair around my temples (like the middle layer) are tight curls.   All this together makes it look poofy.   I don't think this looks good with my face shape.   Is there any way i can keep me hair looking the way it does when i get out of the shower?   I know that gel and hairspray do not work. It gets poofy anyways...   Any advice at all? Please?

Ok, so i got foils for the first time 3 weeks ago, and my hair was so dry/damaged, then i used the Joico K-pac reconstructing- intense conditioning treatment AND IT WAS AMAZING! After 1 use, my hair was soft, healthy, shiny, easy to manage, people even said 'have u dont something to your hair? Its so shiny and healthy'. Even though its intense, and only supposed to be used  like once a week right?      Well, 2 days after using it, i used it again. Now i am scared... have i wrecked my hair by using it again 2 days later? Too soon... im only going to use it once a week now, but im scared that if i use it too much it wont benefit me anymore... is that true??      And also, is it worth getting the Joico K-pak shampoo and conditioner aswell? Honestly, does it do any better with the conditioning treatment, or is using the treatment alone WORK just the same (with a regular shamp & con)      THANKS!!!!!!!!!!!

My skin is light brown but i look like a pale yellow up close lol. So i wanted something with a self tanner, and saw the Dove Energy Glow.   So i bought that since it said it was a subtle tanner, and evened out your own skin tone.      I went home an put it on after my shower an went to sleep.   I woke up like 2 hours later an went to the bathroom, and my hands were almost like a bright orange. I washed my hands a couple times, and nothing happened.

I've had my ears pierced since I was very young and recently decided to stretch them.     I found that the first stretch - t 14, was somewhat painful.  14 to 12 was absolutely nothing for my right ear (left is still 14) and then the 12 to 10 was... painful.  I've been waiting a full month between gauging, which should be plenty of time to heal... am i just doing it wrong?  Should I be sliding the taper in just a little bit through the day instead of all at once? (with water based lube in a hot shower)      In your experience, were some gauges just more difficult to adjust to?  Which ones?

I use clinique and lush for my skincare, and those stuff can get pricey. I think you can find drug store products that work just as good, or better.         Morning:   St. Ives Clear pore cleanser. It's a purifying face wash.   Lush eau de melalenca toner (I think it's the tea tree water the labels where I live are french) I know I said I'd give up lush, but I can't give up this product. I love it too much. For 17$ it lasts a long time.   Oxy daily moisturizer spf 15    Sunscreen with spf40 if it's really sunny outside      Night:   Lotus Aroma eye make-up remover   Baby wipe (used to use MAC wipes) to quickly wipe off makeup.   St. Ives clear pore cleanser for the first wash, to get all my makeup off.    St. Ives Apricot Radiance Cleanser. It has beads in it so I think it will be a nice little exfoliation product. To really clean my face   Clean & Clear daily pore cleaning pads.   Lush tea tree toner      Onces a week (Prob sunday):   St. Ives apricot scrub. For a good exfoliation.    Lush Mask of Magnaminty Cleanser. A good face mask, probably Thursday nights.  Like I said I would cut out Lush, but the two products I said are too amazing to give up.          Do you think that is okay? I've used these products years ago (minus the lush stuff) and I always liked them

I have decided that I want to make a life style change and lead a healthy life from now on. So needless to say I want some sort of fitness tattoo. I also want to incorporate a harpoon head or the full harpoon into the tattoo.       Please don’t send me any Japanese symbols or other commonly used tattoo designs (like a barbell), but besides that I’m open to Ideas. Thank you for your help

My hairs kind of line up with my skin though, so you can still see hair that is lying parallel with my skin that my razor does not get. It's not really on the legs, but mostly in the armpits. It looks really gross. I can never lift my arms because if I wear a shirt, I have sweat stains (doesn't smell...), and if I wear a tank top, I have a very, very, very noticeable and ugly shadow! I tried plucking, but it hurt 'cause the process was so slow, and it was causing a lot of strain to my eyes... lol :p So, um, I don't want to use hot wax or anything, 'cause then I'd have to let my mom know lol. She wouldn't care, I just don't wanna talk to her about it lol. So do those ready-to-use wax kits work...? And can I use them in my armpits? And also how do I keep away sweat stains? :(

20090309223425AAUMO4V	Beauty & Style;Makeup	Do people really analyze/think it's weird when girls wear a full face of makeup daily?	I think I look better (and more importantly, I feel more confident) when I have full makeup on everyday (foundation, powder, blush, lipgloss, heavy eyeshadow and liquid eyeliner). I've been doing this for years and I people seem to notice and point it out(mostly people saying how my makeup is always done or that my eyeshadow looks good) but this semester in college I have this one psychology professor who talked about how insecure people with heavy makeup on can look and a big discussion came out during class and other classmates stated that they didn't see why people would need to wear all that to school, etc. I'm going to wear what I want, but I just wanted to know if other people feel the same way.  It's funny that if I saw someone in the grocery store in heels I might think "I hope they didn't wear heels just to go to the grocery store" but I don't think twice about a made up face :-) I don't obey to night/day makeup either. If I want smokey eye with glitter at 8am, I'm going for it! I wanted to add though that though I wear lots of makeup, I am NOT a gurlie girl- I don't wear skirts or heels or have fake nails or anything. I wear typical casual clothing to school and work (lounge pants/jeans and shirts from Hollister or VS) w/ uggs

I heard Clean and Clear and Nuetrogena are pretty good. What products, not JUST brand, would you recommend?

20090309215133AAS8toZ	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Tattoos	Idea for a tattoo? (neutral milk hotel song based)?	Okay, I always wanted a tattoo that would mean alot to me and not be visible to everyone as the obvious. I find the song Oh comely, by neutral milk hotel absolutely spine chilling. I always had a great interest for the holocaust and all of those lost in it and that time period. Neutral milk hotel's cd "in the aeroplane over the sea" is based solely on anne frank. Basically..what im getting to, is a part in the song "oh comely." repeats "know all your enemies" so i was thinking about getting the dutch translation "weten al uw vijanden" tattooed on my side somewhere to not speak directly from me in english, but in the language that anne frank suffered in. What do you think? I believe the saying holds true because look at what happened in the 1940's and the terrible events that happen even today.

20090309224636AApFdMJ	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Infected nipple piercing?	I got my nipples pierced last tuesday. My nipples were my 11th piercing ever. I've never had an infected piercing before, until now.   The lady who pierced my nipples pierced my left nipple really deep. As soon as we left the shop i knew something was going to happen with my left nipple because it hurt worse than the other one. Yesterday i was cleaning it and noticed that i had white pus inside it, and a red streak has started to develop. There isnt a fever in it yet, but i want to prevent that from happening. Also, the skin tries to grow up around the ball of the barbell, and when i try to push the skin back over it, it's the worst pain ever. I've been cleaning them with Sea Salt and Antibacterial soap like all of my other piercings, but this one is being a real ******. I havent had any problems with crusties or anything, so i know that there isnt one inside my nipple making it irritated. Another thing. The actual hole where the barbell comes out of looks like it has been ripped, or maybe it's just swollen? I dunno. Is there any advice for this from anyone who has had the same problem?   Thanks

20090309231958AAJnRS4	Beauty & Style;Hair	My hair is dyed blonde, and I want to dye it an ash blonde?	My hair is blonde, mainly with a lot of highlights used from Kaleidocolors, I just purchased ION Medium Ash Blonde with a 20 developer from Sallybeauty.com and I'm wondering if I put the Ash Blonde over my hair how it is now, will it develop? I have heard color won't lift color, but does that apply to dyed blonde hair- since it takes bleach to get hair blonde?  Please hold off the comments telling me to get my hair done at a salon, I usually do, but it's starting to add up so I'm just trying to get back to my natural hair color this way.       If someone can explain, that would be fabulous! Thanks!
