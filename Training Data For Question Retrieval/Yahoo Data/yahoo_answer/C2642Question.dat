20090202193317AACUGN6	Pets;Dogs	I am picking up my new dog tomorrow!!!! YAY!?	last saturday I went to a small dog rescue and adopted a 2 yr old schnoodle (schnauzer poodle mix)! His name is scruffy and when they got him he was all matted and was found living as a stray! Anyway he was just the sweetest thing so I can't wait. He is getting neutered so I will be picking him up from a vets office.  On to the question, when I pick him up what should I bring?   I know I will be bringing his collar and leash.   I was planning on having him ride in my lap, since he is small, but would it be better to bring him in a crate?  Oh and how soon until I will be able to take him to the dog park and Petsmart? thanks guys!!!      -fish

20090202193336AApxb7U	Pets;Reptiles	Why won't my ball python eat?	I fed my ball python about two months ago a pretty decent sized rat. It hasn't defecated since then and coils up when the newest rat comes near. Why won't it eat? Is there something wrong with it? It's winter so I don't know if that has anything to do with it. Also, the rat is about the same size as the previous one, maybe a little bigger now because I've kept it for awhile because the snake refuses it.

When I open his crate to let him to the place where he should go, he pees even before reaching that place. This happens every time I try to put him on a leash and take him to the place but when I carry him to the place he does it where I want him to or somewhere near that place. How can I take him on the leash to the potty spot without him doing it on the way?

20090202200050AAI0D6o	Pets;Dogs	Any idea what this behavior could be?	I have a 9 month old dachshund and she has a toy that she carries around everywhere and treats as if it were her puppy. She has been doing this for about 3 months now. She grooms it, guards it from the other dogs, sleeps with it, and even walks around the house whining sometimes because she doesn't know where to hide it from the other dogs. Its a rare moment to catch her without it somewhere close by.    It's not really a concern, because when we take it away from her she doesn't worry too much. We took it away for about a week and she was fine but she was also VERY happy to get it back.      The behavior began a couple weeks after she was spayed, at about 6 months old. Could this have something to do with it? Anyone have any insight or experienced a similar situation?      Thanks!

20090202111939AAC0c6m	Pets;Rodents	OMG hamster chews bars?	My hamster constantly chews the bars of his cage, all the time. He has loads and loads of chew toys and normal toys and I get him out at least twice or three times a day as well as letting him have a run around in his ball. I know it's not safe because two of my friends had hamsters whos teeth become misaligned by doing this and they died, then another friend whose hamsters teeth broke whilst doing it and the vet just managed to save him but it cost her loads of money and it died a few weeks later, so please don't tell me it's safe to let them chew the bars!   I can't afford another cage of any type and I don't want a bin cage or home made one either as the cage was an expensive present plus Gerald would hate not to be able to climb the bars.      1. Does bitter apple spray work?   2. Could I rub meat on the bars, my friend says it will work because most hamsters don't like meat and are vegetarians and Gerald is one of those hamster, would this stop the bar chewing?
20090202132845AACCKfQ	Pets;Birds	Cockatiel egg laying, help?	Ok, so I have had my cockatiel for almost seven years.  In that time, she has become egg bound twice, and required an emergency visit and shots.  I am now trying to avoid this happening again.  ( I give her all the vitamins and minerals they are supposed to be given)   Well I know that they are supposed to have 2 clutches a year with 2 to 5 eggs per clutch, having an egg every other day.  Well in December 08, she had a clutch (her 2nd for 2008) of 3 eggs, each coming every other day.  Then this Jan, she had just 1 egg.  Now she is laying eggs again, a few weeks after the 1 egg.  So far she has had 2 (every other day) but it looks like she is going to have another.  What is going on? what should I do?

If you have anything to say about that, please do.      If you know if I might be able to cut her open and take the eggs out, can you say so?  BTW, I am now down to one see monkey.

What I really enjoy though is volunteering at the dog shelter I've been going to for about five years, so I decided that when after I graduate I want to spend a lot of time helping out at a dog shelter and eventually maybe forming my own shelter? Do you think being a pharmacist or an engineer would provide a better opportunity to do this? I just want some second opinions. Thank you for the help.

20090202141733AAWUvYo	Pets;Horses	Help with a Off Track Thoroughbred...?	I am considering adopting a Off Track Thoroughbred (OTTB) I was wondering if anyone has any tips in care?      My main concern is what bit and what is a good bridle? I currently have a regular bridle, but am looking for a good bit that he can be taught on and then stay on. He has been off the track for about a year. The center where he is currently stabled at, has ridden him I believe. I am going to find out better after I go out there to see all of the horses. I have one I really like though.      Another thing is what type of boots would be good? I plan on using him mostly for arena riding. Maybe a trail once in a while, but my main thing is what is a good boot for arena riding. I might jump him, too.      The last thing is any tips for the re-training? Where should I start, from the very beginning? Just give me information, not stuff like its a big task and I don't advise anyone that isn't an expert.    I have trainers and there will always be a highly experienced person with me until he is trained better and I know him a lot more.    Thanks in advance.

20090202141200AAtqVxr	Pets;Dogs	My 3 month old puppy is growling and biting?	This dog seems to have dominance issues. I read online and through books that when they growl and bite (when you take away something such as food or toys they growl) We have done the eatingbefore her, to show her that we are the leaders of the pack and stuff like that. Any sort of spraying her in the face with a water bottle, or yelling a loud NO, seems to only make her more aggressive. She got to the point where if we pet her near her face she growls, and doesnt hesitate to bite. Now when we want her to stop anything, such as getting into the trash, or not eating a towel, she growls if we get close to her. I have even tried switching it out with food process or a treat so that she can understand that she has to let go. But she is getting more and more aggressive. Before I turn to taking her to behavoir classes or anything of the sort, I want to know if there are any other things I can do to stop her.    By the way she isnt playing when she growls or bites, it is definitaley a way of saying, 'GET THE F**** AWAY'
20090202141306AAcUFOq	Pets;Dogs	How much longer will my 14 year old Beagle live for?	I know there are many variables, but how many more years do you think my puppy will be with me?      She is 14 now, a Beagle and is a good body weight.  She has no health problems where she needs medication.      She has lost most of her hearing (I think), at least 80%.  She has cloudy vision, but doesnt run into anything.      She can walk far distances (we did a 3km walk yesterday) and she is fairly flexible, with climbing up and down stairs.      Lately she has developed some sort of social anxiety, where she is afraid of other dogs...seeing them or hearing them.  It stresses her and she pulls hard on the leash to go home.      No appetite, bowel or urinary problems...and she still initiates play with me at home.      She is my first dog I have ever had, so I'm not sure about the progression....

20090202153358AAiP7nV	Pets;Horses	My mare bites her shank?	My mare has gotten into this habit where every once in a while, she'll grab the shank of her curb bit with her mouth and bite down on it.      I don't pull on her... I keep a ton of slack in my reins at all times. I'm not hurting her, so why would she do this? I'm guessing it's just part of her personality... she likes to chew, lick, and bite everything.      But there are two problems with this. One, I can't stop her if I'm cantering. She bites down so hard that she can't feel it if I pull on that rein. So if I try to stop her, she just turns in the direction of the side she isn't biting. Two, I can't turn her in the other direction. And three, she bit it so hard once, that she chipped her tooth. I don't know why she would keep doing it if it's hurting her.      How can I get her to stop without hurting her even more? If I put something that tasted bad on the shanks, would it bother her when she wasn't biting on them?

Every now and than my paint when she wants her own way will chomp on the bit, and than she will grab it with the corner of her mouth in her teeth and hold it for a minute, besides throwing head. How can I stop this, I thought about those rubber guards, I rode her yesterday, she acted up pretty bad, by throwing her head and grabing the corner of the bit. The bit I use is a snaffle with a copper roller ball in the middle, not severe. She only does this when she wants her way. Should I change bits , or can anyone recommned what i need to do to correct this problem, thanks

I heard it's bad if they don't get some exercise.     The worst thing is that he's hyper at the time when we're asleep, so we can't let him out of the cage without supervision.

20090202173723AARvLJw	Pets;Horses	Miniature horse acting STUPID!?	My sister's miniature (my sister is 15, im 13 if that helps)  is a colt right now and is not yet ready to geld.  My sister and vet insist on keeping him a stud because he is short AUGH.  size isn't everything....  It's so annoying.  This guy... he just started bucking and was inches away from getting my face!  (i was petting our puppy, and he came up and started bucking.  It wasn't kicking.  He did what the broncs did)   Now I know that he should be gelded ASAP.  I KNOW THAT. SO dont tell me that.  (well you can tell me that but dont yell at me for it =])  But like I said, my vet, sister (and my mom, too actually) want him to stay a stud.  Our family is not ready for a stud.  I'm the only one comfortable around horses over 40 inches tall.  My mom's only been around horses on trail rides at our neighbors.  My sister used to be a horse person, then fell off, and got scared off horses (over 40 inches) and basically- forgot her horse sense.  She's smart enough to hit my horse on the HEAD when it smells her.  seriously- I do like the horse, but he's acting too much like a stud, and we aren't ready.  We have a pregnant mare, and that's enough trouble.  A stud is too much!  And, he's a DWARF if that makes it worse (IT DOES) and my mom bought it as my sister and my back to school present... Without asking me who i liked...... Bahh.   So.  How do I convince my family/vet to geld this guy!?

20090202131634AAP2lgs	Pets;Dogs	Help potty training an Adult dog.?	I please ask everyone to put down their swords and help me with my question.  I know this situation/question will upset some readers, but understand that I am trying to change my families ways with our dog.  With that said here is my situation/question:      My family has had our dog(Sox) for a few years now and we have struggled potty training it.  We completely got guilted into taking her from my ailing Grandfather who rescued her off the streets when she was 1 or so.  My Grandfather could not properly train her as she had noticeable trauma and he did not have the energy.  When we took Sox from him she was able to form a great bond with our 8 year old cocker and basically copy catted her way to become potty trained which was use the doggy door into the back yard.  Well our much beloved cocker passed 2 years ago and ever since then Sox has been peeing and pooping in either the house or the garage about 25% of the times she goes.  I will admit that our other dog passing left us apathetic towards Sox but we want to fix that and form a good bond with our addition.      How can we break her of this habit?  I understand this won't be easy and we must as a family make major changes in the way we care for our dog.       A little about her.  She is about 7 years old and is from best guess a jack russel/chihuahua mix.  She has a broken tail so we think she for sure has some major trauma issues from before my Grandfather rescued her.      Thank you to all that can lend a helping hand.

20090202173821AAHFuLl	Pets;Dogs	Why does the dog continue to jump at me continuously?	Well, you know my question "Should I keep this lost dog?"      I'm doing everything I can to find the owner.      However, there's this weird problem. O__O;      Two days after I've kept the dog in my backyard till the owner finds it, it started jumping a lot, but only when i come outside. Once I go outside, she approaches me and I don't know what she's trying to tell me. She keeps trying to get up or something. Each time, it's like she wants to bite me.      Just today, she tried to bite me on the leg but her to stop before it dug in deep into my skin. I didn't really feel anything however, and there is no mark or blood on the slightly bitten area.       Do you know what might be happening to the dog? D:         Some other details you might need? -----------------~~----;   I do not keep it in the house. It remained outside ever since I let it in my backyard.      It does not have a dog house, but I got it a cardboard box to stay in for a while covered in rain coats, just in case it rains.   See, in California, it doesn't rain as much.    It's bed is made of fluffy jackets.      I don't have a rubber ball or tennis ball or anything like that for it to play with, but I got it some old stuffed animals. Three, to be exact.       I play with it everyday for at least three hours. I pet it for about ten minutes, then I give it some treats.          Do you know what might be wrong with the poor dog? D:

20090202180745AAJGPB5	Pets;Horses	Any suggestions about cause of leg deformity/lameness?	A friend has a senior horse who has been under the care of a vet for about the last year treating a lameness problem that occured after she changed farriers. I see the horse about every two months, and recall that first the horse just appeared sore. More noticeably during this time the horse dropped a good 150 pounds or more.       The vet diagnosed founder, but it had to be a very mild founder if at all. (I have a Cushings horse that has had severe founder, so I think I'd have fair ability to assess this, and I never saw any distinct signs of founder or active laminitis.) The vet also recommended changing to alfalfa and a senior feed supplement from grass hay. (Another thing that tells me it wasn't founder, but I digress.) One leg then became noticeably sore and bowed forward from hock to knee. Several months later, the horse is diagnosed with arthritis (no argument there) and treated with bute and monthly Legend shot. Owner thinks mobility is increasing, but here's the deal:      It's now the entire leg that is bowed. I wish I could better describe this, but the shoulder joint is pushed forward and the leg from shoulder to knee is about 15-degrees angled back from where it should be. Then from the knee to the hock, the leg is bowed forward. The hock to hoof joints are just balanced oddly so the horse is still mobile. I find it hard to believe that arthritis can onset in ONE leg so rapidly. It's been this way for about 4 to 6 months without any change that I can see. I suspect it's more of a tendon matter, perhaps something that started below the knee and now the horse's shoulder has adjusted to make that leg mobile. Horse stands, walks, lays down, etc., and prefers flat terrain. Vet has made no suggestions beyond keeping the horse comfortable with pain and arthritis meds, and I agree at age 32 there's not a lot of invasive stuff that can be done. I can't find any information readily available about a whole-leg lameness. It's definitely beyond a check ligament or DDF....but it MAY have started as a contracted DDF. When she walks you can hear a faint "snapping" like a tendon moving across a joint. Horse is already on a glucosamine/chondroitin sulfate product and has been for years.

20090202131645AA7L3wN	Pets;Fish	I found a baby fish in my tank before, help please!?	A few hours ago, i saw this tiny fish swimming against the glass. I have 2 male platies and 5 zebra danios so im guessing the danios laid eggs. I got so excited so i told my mom but when i came back, the baby fish was gone. I still cant find it so the other fish probably ate it. Im just curious how my danios laid eggs though. The temperature isnt even high, its set at 72 degrees. Also, i never fed the females brine shrimp. Is it possible that there are other eggs hidden in the gravel? How come there was only one fish that hatched? If i raised the temperature to 76, will the rest of the eggs hatch?    Sorry about all the questions, i never had fry before. Please answer my questions! Thank you.
20090202132626AApX2fg	Pets;Other - Pets	I have two mice, one is coughing/sneezing...?	I know this gets asked on here a lot, but this is a bit different from the questions I have read prior to posting. I have two female mice in the same tank with a wire cage topper and I use cardboard on the flooring of the cage topper. Both were bought about September or late August of 2007. One of the mice sneezes and coughs in fits, but this only happens when it is out and about. Furthermore, it eats fine and gets around well considering her age. One of her eyes is a little more dull than the other- which I hear is another sign of the breathing problem-, but I believe that has more to do with the fact that she had a stroke early last summer. As far as the stroke goes, she was looking very, very bad, but made a full recovery to the point where she still does a fair share of climbing. The question is this: is it a good idea to try and segregate her from the other, or because it doesn't seem to have spread to the other mouse whatsoever (nothing wrong with her except a little bit of balding), would separation be a bad idea in case it causes anxiety for the two of them? Lastly, if I wanted to administer her an antibiotic, what would a vet most likely prescribe? I have access to antibiotics and would like to avoid the veterinarian bill

I have a 10 month old dachshund...cross?  he definitely does NOT look like a dachshund... but he is...and I think he has some jack or something in him because hes INSAAANNNEELLLYYY hyper...       I have NOT neutered him yet because he formed a hernia and they will remove the hernia and neuter him at the same time I just need to come up with $300 or so dollars.       ANYWAYS...    so in the mean time..   hes up to date on shots    and ive taken him to the dog park ..       one time there were ABSOLUTELY no dogs so i let him off his lead...      he ran crazily forever and barked and played but when its time to go he wont come to me and if I grab him he'll snap at me and run off...   he's literally bitten me on several occassions.    this is with his favorite treat in hand...   and it was getting dark so i wasn't going to stay any longer...especially that late.       this also happens a LOT at home.    i live in a house that has a yard that doesnt have a door leading in to the fence...    so ill have to go out and either pick him up or put him back on his lead because lately (because of his age and not being neutered yet) he likes to run off...and bark at neighbors...and run the streets.    its dangerous because so many dogs have been runover on my street because there i live on a steep hill and you cant see when youre driving if you're going to hit something or not.       anyways,    he will bite me    or just run off and stare at me...   like im going to hurt him or something.      ive sat down for 10 minutes trying to get him to come to me but he just sits and stares and if i go to pick him up he'll run off...   ive tried treats and everything.       i know its because he wants to stay outside    and usually when i take him back inside he'll go into his crate because im leaving.   he is mostly an outside dog but during the winter he spends most of the time inside...          its just really annoying that my dog bites me or runs off (EVEN WITH TREATS AND ME BEING COMPLETELY CALM AND PATIENT) when i call him.    even embarrassing when people are around...         does anyone have any advice for me???    please!

I have a good water filter and an oxygen pump as well as a heater. It has recently occurred, but my fish appear to be okay until I turn off the lights for a few hours and when I come back they are lying on the bottom of the tank and they look lighter. And I noticed that their eyes become faded as well. For example, today I came home from school and had a dentist appointment, so I turned off the light of the fish tank. I've been gone for 5 hours and I came home seeing that my fish are at the bottom of the tank and appear discolored. I leave the light on for a while and their colors become more natural and look better. Is there a chance that my fish are sick? Also, one of my discus fish is blue. And just recently, it has developed brown patches on its skin. It's not visible from far away, but when you look up close you can see it. Could this be fungus or bacteria that is present in the tank? My fish tank is established in an area that never has sunlight directly shining on it. Are my fish sick? What could I do? And does anyone know if the eye color of the fish can be affiliated with signs of near death? Please help. I'm extremely worried. :[

He had them before we moved in together.I am not sure on how to punish, how to get him to use the litter box again. I have discussed crating them while I'm away and at night. I don't want to though they have always been able to roam and they would probably cry. I have always had dogs so i don't know how to deal with this.Please any suggestion would be helpful.

So I left my 6 year old Yorkie at my friend's house (who is also his babysitter) so she could take care of him for me as I left town for the day. Well, when I came back the following day, I get this phone call call from her saying something is wrong with my dog. She informs that when she had came home from work, he did not greet her (you know, the typical greeting dogs would give when their loved ones would come back home), but rather, he was laying on the couch, seeming to be really tired. When she checked what was wrong with him, she noticed really red marks under his fur.. Some spots throughout his body seemed to be flushed with red, which isn't obviously normal.      He's not bleeding, but I'm just wondering, what could it be?   I had to drop him off and leave him overnight with the Vet so that she could keep an eye on him.      I'm praying to God that he will be okay..      Anyone have any idea what could be wrong?

20090202201350AA5bxir	Pets;Rodents	How to convince my parents to get me a Guinea Pig?	I've been researching them for MONTHS, I've written a 7-page report, my birthday's 3 months away and they're still not sure.   I went to a pet store and looked at all the prices, I bought a Guinea Pig book,  I'm looking for cubes for the C & C cage I'm going to make (if I ever get two Guinea Pigs!)    They said the two main factors are:      1. My autistic sister (who likes to pick up stuff then drop them, squeeze animals until they can't breath, and she REALLY likes to go into my bedroom, where I'll keep the Guinea Pigs. They won't let me get a lock for my door.)   2. They think THEY'LL take care of the Guinea Pigs. No way! They practically KILLED the last 7 fish we had. The result? *fluuuush*      So because of number 2 (which I've tried to convince them SEVERAL weeks that they won't do), they want me to show a habit (MONTHS) of a) keeping my room clean, b) making sure that I'll clean up any mess my sister leaves in my room, c) doing all my homework (I got Straight A's on my last report card! Yay!), and d) being nice.      I'm not even sure that they'll get me 2 on my birthday! They won't tell me how long, because they want me to have a commitment. I do, but I'm getting impatient (I've been doing this for a month now, and it's not fun! :P)   Thanks for reading this- but is there ANY WAY TO HELP THEM GET ME TWO GUINEA PIGS SOONER? Sooner than when? I don't know x_X

20090202201737AA1DM34	Pets;Fish	My Beta fish is hurting itself!?	It is in a 1/2 gallon tank, and it keeps swimming into the walls. It is being very agressive and I have to keep the tank covered so he won't jump out. He has these "spurts" about every twenty minutes or so. I'm looking into getting a bigger tank, but is there another problem that is making him crazy? He is being very aggressive, and it just started a day ago.

20090202202022AAx7G19	Pets;Dogs	Puppy trouble ! Help !!!?	Ok well today my puppy has been driving me nuts ! he would pee and poo everywhere! i would take him out to the backyard to do his business for like 20 minute, but he would not. So as soon as i take him inside he instantly pees and poops there! i think that hes getting very spoiled because i let him sleep in my bed, give him SOME table food and treat him like the rest of the family. He started to bite really hard on my hands, i would say not in a firm voice and try EVERYTHING that i read online but he would just stare at me then jump on my face and bite harder. He even ripped a hole in my pants! he also started growling when i pick him up when he does not want to be picked up. I tried locking him in a crate but he would scream non stop until someone comes, one time he was screaming so much that he threw up!!! i give him lots of love and tell him how good he is. but sometimes i feel like hes doing that on purpise because as soon as i tell him not to touch a plant for example he looks at me and starts eating it, but if i said nothing about the plant he would not even notice it. so today he was driving me crazy! i did not sleep for for ages because he would not let me! he pooped everywhere so i just could not take it any longer and hit him!!! not too hard but just enough so he would understand. he quickly ran to his crate and stayed there for an hour without making a sound. so now he seems like he hates me! because he does not follow me around like he usually does and seems very quite. So i need some advice on what to do HELP PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

20090202202839AAUOWkh	Pets;Dogs	Two large dogs... no fence help!?	I have a great dane (10 weeks old) asnd a pit bull mix that need to be contained. Paying to put up a fence is way to expensive and my husband is in the army and getting ready to deploy so he doesnt have the time to put one up.  I was considering one of the invisible fences but am not sure my dogs will be contained. My pitt bull (Buster) is very hyper and runs fast when he is outside, so if he had the shock collar on, he wouldn't feel it fast enough. I also think my great dane (Pepper) is too big to even feel the pain of the shock. I leave them outside sometimes but they wander too far (I have 5 acres). They love being outside too much for me to just take them out to go to the bathroom and come back inside. Any suggestions? I have about an acre that I want to fence in. Fencing an acre with conventional fencing will be way too expensive with installation and such. Thanks

20090202203848AAN4jPd	Pets;Rodents	How should I treat my infant rats for lice?	I just had my first litter of rats and noticed that they, as well as the momma, have lice. I never had worried to much about lice on my adult rats because I couldn't see them, but seeing the babied with so many rally jarred me. I want to treat them and the momma as soon as possible, but I know I need to wait until they are at least 4 weeks to treat them with something like Advantage or Revolution. They are only 9 days old. Is there anything I could do in the meantime to reduce irritation, like dusting them with baby powder, or putting mineral oil or Vitamin E on them?
