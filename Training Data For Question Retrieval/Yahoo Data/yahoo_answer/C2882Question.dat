20090202144816AACwqnh	Environment;Global Warming	Is my friend right or wrong?	I am unsure whether to believe or not believe in global warming. My friend, who is a huge conservative, claims global warming is just liberal crud. He says that global warming is just a natural cycle. When I pointed to all the organizations who are fighting global warming he told me that they are only doing that because that's where the money is.  He also pointed to the scare during the 1970's of Global Cooling claiming this was proof that Global Warming was just a fad. While I don't completely disagree I don't completely agree either. So, is my friend right or wrong.

20090202194858AAIGS9d	Environment;Alternative Fuel Vehicles	I need help deciding whether to trade my car in for a bike/public transport!?	I've been a nanny for the past few years so have had to have a car for the carseats. I'm looking for a non-nannying job now and realised I don't have any excuses to still have a car...BUT after thinking about it, I have been able to find a few (some are very silly, and a bit girly) but I still need help solving these before I can commit to actually doing this...         My PROS list looks like this:   * Environmentally friendly   * More cost effective (unless I'm using public transport - it would cost me about $50 per week if I used a bus/train every day for a week, but only about $35 for car costs - so I'd like to cycle mostly if I sold my car)   * Good fitness   * ??? any others that you can give me?         CONS   * I'll get sweaty by the time I get anywhere and won't necessarily have a shower available at the end of the trip (that's the most girly one!)   * Long distances would be tricky   * I'm not sure I'd be comfortable riding at night   * How would I get my groceries home??   * ??? any others?         Thanks so much for your help in advance...

20090202202443AAIle5R	Environment;Global Warming	Why do people still believe in man made Global warming?	Man made Global warming has been disproved by the majority of scientists in the world yet people are still operating under the idea that it is fact. Most scientists including meteorologist at the weather channel call the theory by Al Gore pseudoscience. There was a panel of some 600 questionable scientists at the UN who originally put forward this theory and since then there have been more then double that amount of scientists who have come out strongly against it. The earth has been shown historically to go through warming and cooling trends and it has been shown to be caused by volcanic activity, the tilt of the planet, solar cycles, and shifts in oceanic currents and the reversal of the Earth's magnetic fields. I have heard one scientist put it this way: if the atmosphere was a 100 story building and the total amount of CO2 emissions produced from man made sources were placed in the building it would only amount to the thickness of the linoleum on the ground floor. Kind of puts things in perspective. There are many people making a lot of money on this theory by selling carbon credits which is a total sham in and of itself. One person of note who is making millions off of carbon credits is Al Gore so don't tell me he doesn't have anything to gain by pushing this agenda. Read up on the issues before you call me a liar and insult me because it is ignorance that has caused so many of these problems to begin with.
