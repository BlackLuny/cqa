I am a singer who wants to get out there a bit more, so I thought doing some open mic nights may be a good start. I don't know what to sing. I usually sing hip hop/pop music, but the only instrument I kind of play is the guitar, but am not sure if I am good enough to accompany myself. Do people sing a capella? Also, what do most people sing?      Thanks
20090304091320AAYhQtT	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Anyone know this teen book that was popular in the 80's?	It was fiction; our teacher read it to us in the fifth grade, so maybe 1985?       It was about a very poor family - maybe in Appalachia. There was an older girl who was pretty, but not bright, and then another sister who was kind of in charge of the family. There were younger siblings, but I don't know how many. The parents were either dead or dying, and they had no money. The story was about how the one sister kept everything running without the county or social services realizing the kids were on their own. There was a guy who was rich, but kind of a jerk with poor oral hygiene, who wanted to marry the stupid/pretty sister, but the smart one wouldn't allow it until the very end.       Ring any bells for anybody? It's killing me. Thanks.

Is the punctuation right?   How could I write it better?      Here's my description paragraph:   For the first time I saw my reflection: I saw how my sleek blonde hair tumbled down my neck, how fragile my porcelain skin seemed, how my aqua blue eyes glistened in the light, how my face curved into a diamond shape - alike an elf, how my eyes gazed longing fully back at me, they were too old for my face, how the synthesis of ‘Cynthia’ was combined; and I for one, was shocked.

20090304092851AArblWT	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Story chapter ideas need some help please!!?	Ok so please answer any or all of the following questions but first the plot:      A normal homeschooled 18 year old girl meets a 19 year old rock star at a band meet and greet, and they immediatly have a connection. A Realtionship starts and he gets to fly in every few weeks to see her town to see her. the story it going to take place over quite a few months possibly even years..pretty much their dating..   So here are the questions      A: I want to have a part where her boyfriend is kinda protecting / defending her from something or someone. I’ve been stuck on this for awhile I don’t know how.. she has a great relationship with her parents and siblings so it cant be something with that…I don’t want him to have to save her life…violence is ok but not to much a small fight would be cool.      B: ok so shes gonna go to stay with him in CA for a week, well the paparazzi end up finding them which leads to a small fight, and than she heres him and some other people rehearsing a script for a movie however she doesnt know that (shes kinad easdropping) and these people are telling him he needs to dump her its just a script not real but she thinks it is, so basically shes gonna leave before the week is up but I need another thing to push her over the edge that makes her leave! She really loves him and she really loves her so I need something else to make her leave..and he cant cheat! ;)      C: one of them needs to get hurt I was thinking while shes at her house a couple states away her rock star boyfriends gonna be driving and a drunk driver is gonna get in a car wreck...and hes pretty critical..is that to much?? OR should she be the one to get hurt and end up in the hospital?

Well,over the weekend I went to a church function and I was talking to my vicar about Twilight and I mentioned the topic on how Edward won't change Bella into a vampire..And he brought up the idea that maybe the reason why    Edward didn't want to turn Bella into a vampire was because he didn't want Bella to go to hell.   And I thought he brought up a good idea!   Maybe that is the reason why he doesn't want to turn Bella into a vampire..I thought that Edward didn't want to turn Bella into a vampire because she would be going through pain during the transformation..I haven't ever really thought about it..so maybe you can tell me...   Do you think this is the reason why Edward won't turn    Bella into a vampire?   OR   Is there another reason?   Thanks so much!   Twilight Addict!! :]=

First, list at least three topics you will want to cover. Then write one paragraph about each one. The information should relate only to foreign policy between 1867 and 1920.

20090304102404AAdpwi7	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I am constantly hungry, what should I do?	I am an orphan. My parents died when I was little, and I was sent to  live with my rich relatives. While my mother's brother, my uncle Reed, lived, it was all right. When he died, it became really bad. My aunt  Reed disliked me, my cousins bullied me. At last she sent me to a  boarding school Lowood, a charitable institution. It's very cold here all the time, and often can't wash themselves because the water's frozen. But the food it the worst. For breakfast they give us porridge, frequently burnt to a nauseous mess; burnt porridge is almost as bad as rotten potatoes; famine itself soon sickens over it. It's impossible to eat. When it's not burnt, the portions are very little. Soon after five p.m. we have another meal, consisting of a small mug of coffee, and half-a-slice of brown bread. Then we have a recreation, then study; then the glass of water and the piece of oat-cake, prayers, and bed. Older girls often take my food, because they are starved, and I have nothing to eat at all. Every night, when I go to bed, I imagine a supper of hot roast   potatoes, or white bread and new milk. Mr. Brocklehurst, treasurer and manager of the establishment, says that if we are well fed, we will get accustomed to habits of luxury and indulgence, and we must be brought up hardy, patient, self-denying. He says that wee should think about Christian martyrs whenever we are hungry. It's unbearable and I   can't endure it anymore. What should I do?

20090304070715AAVcZST	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Speaker/Tone of Snake poem?	Securely sunning in a forest glade,   A mild, well-meaning snake   Approved the adaptations he had made   For safety’s sake.      He liked the skin he had—   Its mottled camouflage, its look of mail,   And was content that he had thought to add   A rattling tail.         The tail was not for drumming up a fight;   No, nothing of the sort.   And he would only use his poisoned bite   As last resort.         A peasant now drew near,   Collecting wood; the snake, observing this,   Expressed concern by uttering a clear   But civil hiss.         The simple churl, his nerves at once unstrung,   Mistook the other’s tone   And dashed his brains out with a deftly-flung   Pre-emptive stone.      Moral      Security, alas, can give   A threatening impression;   Too much defense-initiative   Can prompt aggression.         --- Richard Wilbur's poem "A Fable"      i'm having a hard time with this. what exactly is the tone?      the speaker is hard to tell as well - it's in third person. but how can you tell the persona of the speaker?

20090304061023AAhN4ye	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Analysis of Winter memories by Thoreau?	Winter Memories      Within the circuit of this plodding life   There enter moments of an azure hue,   Untarnished fair as is the violet   Or anemone, when the spring stew them   By some meandering rivulet, which make   The best philosophy untrue that aims   But to console man for his grievences.   I have remembered when the winter came,   High in my chamber in the frosty nights,   When in the still light of the cheerful moon,   On the every twig and rail and jutting spout,   The icy spears were adding to their length   Against the arrows of the coming sun,   How in the shimmering noon of winter past   Some unrecorded beam slanted across   The upland pastures where the Johnwort grew;   Or heard, amid the verdure of my mind,   The bee's long smothered hum, on the blue flag   Loitering amidst the mead; or busy rill,   Which now through all its course stands still and dumb   Its own memorial, - purling at its play   Along the slopes, and through the meadows next,   Until its youthful sound was hushed at last   In the staid current of the lowland stream;   Or seen the furrows shine but late upturned,   And where the fieldfare followed in the rear,   When all the fields around lay bound and hoar   Beneath a thick integument of snow.   So by God's cheap economy made rich   To go upon my winter's task again.      I would like some analysis on any themes, or the deeper meaning of it. Thanks!

I'm almost done with the second draft of my YA Fantasy novel, and it's 45,000 words. I've done a lot of research on word counts, and I've found that 45,000 words is fine for a YA novel (40,000 is the minimum), but too short for an Adult Fantasy novel. So what about YA Fantasy? I haven't found any information that applies specifically to this sub-genre. Do you think my book is long enough?      I posted this question earlier, but I'd like a few more responses :).
20090304072847AAsjk7d	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Looking for the title/author of a story about a child devil in Catholic school (not Hellboy)?	Okay, this one's something of a shot in the dark, as I don't remember enough details to make a google search productive.      When I was in grade school, I read a story about a young devil who decided he wanted to be good.  He went to a Catholic school (I can't remember if his teacher was a regular nun or Mary herself, she did seem to have mystic abilities), and at the end of the story his horns fell off.  The only other concrete detail I remember is a math problem he was posed, which went something like, "What number has one leg shorter than the other, and blue eyes?"  He eventually wrote 189 and added eyes to the 8.  The teacher brought the number to life and it limped away.      I'm pretty sure it was written prior to 1970, as I recall reading it in a somewhat musty hardcover book.  But I don't remember if it was one of my mom's books, or something I got out of the school library (I went to Catholic grade school), so I really can't narrow it down any further than that.  I think it was part of a textbook or anthology, not a full-length novel.      (As a purely irrelevant aside, I can't help but wonder if Mike Mignola read the same story as a kid and it helped inspire Hellboy.  Then again, if it did inspire him, maybe someone who's a big Mignola fan would know the answer.)

Its an opinion question, but my text doesn't give me enough information to answer these questions. I tried wikipedia by the way. Nothing.      Q: Many critics feel that the Yalta Conference did not do enough to ensure world peace following World War II. Why do so many people blame Roosevelt for the failure? Knowing that Stalin had implemented a communist government in the Soviet Union and hoped to extend it to other parts of eastern Europe, do you think that Roosevelt and Churchill could have done anything more or better?      Thank you so much!      10 points to best answer.      :)

Strands of time   spun to years,   spun to wisdom.   gleaming interlocking web,   many spiders weaving words.      Transparent patter silhouette,   perfect from afar...   one marring thought,   one child's finger outstretched and the web floats away,   drifts,   and is re-created.      World falls still,   still searching, still praying, still...here,   dancing on sticky-silk edges,   dancing on transient beauty.

20090304074402AAYFCfH	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	How does this plot summary sound to you?	ACTUALLY I'M MORE INTERESTED IN WHAT YOU THINK OF THE STORY IN GENERAL, NOT MY MEDIOCRE SUMMARY OF IT, AND BY THE WAY, PLEASE DON'T LEAVE THE QUESTION JUST BECAUSE IT'S LONG. I'VE TRIED EXTREMELY HARD TO MAKE ANSWERING IT WORTH YOUR WHILE!!!!!!!                  A man with long black hair and a beard wakes up without a clue of who he is or about his past life. He finds himself in what remains of some ancient shambles of a prison in the middle of a vast wasteland. He is greeted shortly after waking by an angel who claims that she was sent to protect him against the horrors that would consume him in the wilderness. Additionally, the angel instructs him to gather what little amount of people are able to survive in the wastes and lead them to a safe haven, however the location of this safe haven is vague at best to the protagonist. He then leaves the ruins with great ease as they have long ago been out of order. After wandering for some time searching for life and honing his skills at utilizing his guardian angel's power (manipulating objects without touching them, improved strength… etc) he finds yet another ruin. Deciding to gather his thoughts and rest for at least a little while, he makes his shelter there.      After living there for a few days he catches a brief glance at a nearby traveling heard of large white beasts about 80 feet from the his encampment. And from then on he would make a regular basis out of sneaking among them while they slept and placing food for them to eat that they might evade starvation.. One day, a cub of the pack had decided to make it's way into the man's ruin and sleep with him for the night (the man was initially terrified by this but later realized that this small pup, at least, meant him no harm).Things were livable, not ideal necessarily but certainly livable.       The morning after however, he was lying with his back to the floor when he saw in the sky, some vultures cycling around. Deeply concerned, he woke the cub beside him and started for were he remembered seeing the cub’s pack. But within only a few seconds he had already seen what amounted to a few discarded limbs and an array of blood spatter, partially soaked up by the thirsty terrain. The beast that was left emitted a long a terrible roar at the sadness of it’s great loss. The angel then reappeared to the man and explained that while she offered her most sincere condolences, he must press on to find the menace responsible and if at all possible, any survivors. After hearing this he did come to realize that there was a trail of blood to be followed. And so he mounted up atop the beast that remained and road for were ever the blood trail lead.      The trail dissipated gradually and he had no idea were to look and so he departed for a far off settlement which he could barely see in the distance. He arrived there and was provided with food and lodging but while there heard various remarks from the villagers that there was something wrong with his hands and that he "has a demon" He came to notice that all the people of this place had no black fur, red skin or long claws on their hands like he did. Confused, he consulted the angel and was quickly reassured that the whole business pertained to 'scars of the past' and ought not to be paid any heed. That night he stabled his pet near him at the inn he was sleeping in, and he slept good dreams of leading the people of this region to the oasis that the angel had promised.      The following morning he awoke only to the sight of burning buildings and slaughtered innocents. Cursing the heavens, he was then confronted by his angel but realizes not only that it was laughing at the atrocities that had transpired there but also that the villagers were right, he did indeed have a demon. (it no longer chose to appear as a messenger of light but as a smoldering menace with large horns and an oddly majestic evil about him, oh yeah it's actually a him) He came to realize that the way his hands looked were probably a result of channeling the demon’s sorcery, and that weather he liked it or not, he was a warlock.        The man discovered one of the demon's minions (a possessed corpse of a human) continuing to slaughter townsfolk and demanded that it tell him were his master was. Afraid of loosing access to the realm of men, the possessed corpse hurriedly tells him. Of course, the man had no intention of leaving such a monstrosity alive and quickly destroyed it along with all it’s brethren. Filled with a rage he mounted his beast and rode for the destination told to him and during this time he was continuing to be tormented by his demon. And it tells him that all along, the oasis was really the demon's base of operations and that he would manage to expunge all who live regardless of weather the man had brought any survivors with him or not. And so he reaches his goal and finds a blighted, black area with a horrifying black, burning tower in the center(out of which he could hear screams of suffe

20090304072227AAYlm8e	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	God created men in his own image?	It says that in the bible and most people simply interpret it as humans looking like god. Somehow I don't think that's it. We imagine god as this perfect, all knowing being. But if he were perfect then he would have no ambition, He'd be absolutely content. But he wasn't, was he? He wanted more.       He wanted to share his love with others. He was lonely. Loneliness is an emotion. He's the original parent. But as a parent, there were obviously things he couldn't for see. Things like his children disobeying him. Then he had to improvise.      OR       God was the original scientist. He is everything and nothing is above him, so he has no temptation. But he wanted to see what temptation has the power to do, so he made people and he gave them free will.       Either way, the way I see it God wanted to learn and he has been learning with us.      Another thing that this has made me think of. God in the old testament and even the new, was violent. He was angry and vengeful and taught people to obey him or perish. Then Jesus came along and preached peace and compassion. Turn the other cheek. Was what Jesus said what God wanted? Or was he rebelling against his father? I've often disagreed with the decisions my father has made and the way he has lived his life, but that doesn't mean I don't love or respect him. The one thing that I found to be particularly interesting was this. When Jesus was on the cross he said, "Forgive them father, for they know not what they do." Was God ready to avenge his son? Did what Jesus said change God's ideas or make him reconsider? Jesus had a view of humanity that God could never have. He was a human. Was Jesus only sent to save us? Or was there something more? Was Jesus sent to learn from us? God created us in his own image. What's more characteristic of the image of humans that the need to learn?

For me, English is a very difficult language. But I want to learn English. In fact, I want to be fluent in English, so I was determined to join the Pai Chai Chronicle after seeing a poster advertising “Cub Reporters Wanted” last November.          A week after joining the magazine, I undertook my first task. Covering ‘The 11th International Folklore Festival’ was my first assignment. In the concert hall, I took pictures and made notes about the performances. When I got back home, I immediately put pen to paper. It was a laborious task for me. It took a long time to look up words in the dictionary and write the article. The article I did was very short but as I looked over what I had written, my heart was full. When the PCC magazine was published, my heart skipped a beat as I saw the results of my hard work in print.           Frankly speaking, even now English is very difficult for me, and writing an article is arduous work. However, I will go on working diligently because I am proud to have become a PCC Reporter.

Here it is~      I count the dismal time by months and years   Since last I felt the green sward under foot,   And the great breath of all things summer-   Met mine upon my lips. Now earth appears   As strange to me as dreams of distant spheres   Or thoughts of Heaven we weep at. Nature's lute   Sounds on, behind this door so closely shut,   A strange wild music to the prisoner's ears,   Dilated by the distance, till the brain   Grows dim with fancies which it feels too   While ever, with a visionary pain,   Past the precluded senses, sweep and Rhine   Streams, forests, glades, and many a golden train   Of sunlit hills transfigured to Divine.

I am writing a young adult fantasy novel and am thinking it will end up around 50,000 words.

This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,   To love that well which thou must leave ere long.

20090304084241AAiurJm	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Does this story opening grab your attention?	And what do you think of it in general?   Any and all critics are welcome!      “… When you laugh certain organs are stimulated, your heart rate and blood pressure increase, and over a period of time your body will release neuropeptides. When you cry from sadness, your tears…” he had to stop to take a drink; he had been talking so quickly that his saliva hadn’t been able to keep up. At this point you could see the excitement and energy just radiating from his every gesture and his eyes grew wider, “your tears produce more manganese and prolactin than what is necessary for the normal rewetting of the eyes!!!” he ended with a great burst of excitement as if his enthusiasm was supposed to somehow spark a revelation in me.      The look of confusion must have been evident on my face because after a brief pause he continued on with his excited rampage of words, “The HDA has given us all the information needed to know what the body is doing and why! This is more than every scientist has ever dreamt of having!! Is the suspect lying or telling the truth? We know by picking apart his sensory system!! The body’s reactions to stimulus are so neatly defined. Some of those reactions are ensnarled in a complex type of cypher; but we finally have the technology to unlock the physical encryption!! Why the only information we can’t access, yet, is thoughts. My how entertaining that discovery could be!” He chuckled as he considered the possibility, “Also, the HDA is equipped with a unique tracking mechanism; if a boy is lost in the woods, we can find him! The implications are literally endless!! Crimes will be solved without the guesswork or speculation, medical research and development will make epic breakthroughs!!

20090304104602AApTuar	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What sort of people would be most interested in this book?	I'm trying to figure out how to market the book David Garrick, by T.W. Robertson.    http://www.target.com/David-Garrick-Nove...       Summary: "The year is 1742, and David Garrick is the biggest celebrity in London, performing Romeo and Hamlet every night at the Drury Lane playhouse. He is admired by all... but the tables are turned one evening when he catches sight of a beautiful girl in the audience. He cannot forget her, and searches the city in vain trying to find her. Then one day, a wealthy old man contacts Garrick, complaining that his daughter has developed a crush on him so strong that she is refusing to be wed to a handsome, up-and-coming nobleman. Will Garrick assist in making her forget her foolish attraction to a play-actor? Imagine the horror, of Garrick and the father alike, when it is discovered - the girl is the very girl that Garrick loves!"      For the record, I'm not the author (in fact I think the author has been dead for about 150 years.) I'm just trying to figure out how to promote it.      Would teenage girls be the best people to appeal to? The edition in question is the script for the stageplay, and the novelization of 1865 printed side by side, so it might not interest them...?

The subject is freedom, and my teacher has told us to bring in 3 pictures of the subject within freedom we have chose. We can do the project in anyway we like eg. drawing, painting, 3d model; but i've already decided on drawing, as its my strongest point.      My main problem is, i cant think of a good, but Original theme. Im quite good at drawing things from my imagination, as i like to doodle a lot in the back of my book, but I cant find a way to link that to freedom.

20090304100121AAq2tsY	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	How can anyone in their right mind equate homophobia with racism or sexism?	I love how people equate disapproval of homosexual conduct with racism or sexism, yet they seem to be forgetting one of the most common arguments against homosexuality, "Hate the sin, love the sinner." "Hate the sin, love the sinner" is NOT applicable to race or sex in ANY manner because there's no behavior involved in being a woman or being black. There's NO way ANYONE could EVER say, "I don't hate blacks. I just hate the color of their skin," or "I don't hate women. I just hate their female gender or womanlike appearance." However, there IS such a thing as homosexual behavior and you CAN DEFINITELY say, "I don't hate gays. I just don't approve of the act of sex between two people of the same gender. However, if they want to do it, it's their business." That's no different than saying, "I don't hate unwed mothers. I just hate the act of fornicating and having children out of wedlock. However, if they want to do it, it's their business." THAT makes sense, doesn't it? Do you understand the distinction?

The past will haunt,      The smiles gaunt      And the tears will leave a trail.      But dark soul aside,      And mind blocked away,      Her body was slowly dying      Eaten away      By memories’ stay      And she knew the world was lying.      She moved with a grace      Away from the crowd      To the small comfort of dark      Still alive      Yet cold and dead      She never left a mark.      No one would mourn      Alone and forlorn      for eyes and heart of gray      so there she stood      so misunderstood      And slowly began to pray      Nobody noticed      Nobody cared      For she had no friends to cry      That the sad, gray girl      Who sat in the corner      Had even said good-bye.

She slowly opened her eyes, looking at the thin cracks in the ceiling, trying to concentrate.She suddenly remembered and hoped that it was all just a dream, she closed her eyes again convincing her self that she will wake up in her old room.   But the telepgone rang again.      It was a cloudy morning in an almost empty room in a motel in texas when a young girl slowly got up, putting an arm on a dark blue sheet on the edge of an old bed, trying not to make a noise.   she stood up and...         so should i continue writing it?      ** i don't know where else to post it

20090304121734AA9ZVxQ	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Photography	How would you feel if you wife models nude?	OK so basically my wife models nude.  Im cool with it, but she keeps telling me she is open to try new things in modeling.  not porn but she wants do shoots with a possible nude male involved in it thats not me.  She trys to rationalize it saying its art and that she trusts who she works with. I on the other hand not so keen on the whole idea in fact it bothers me.  I've told her how i feel. It kind of goes in one ear and out the other as i try to give my opionion as if i just stole all her energy on the subject and that she's thinking i dont care how he feels cause this is what I want.  What do you guys think i need your opinions?
