You wouldn't put a child in there & you shouldn't put a dog in one either."<br>  <br>  Incorrect.  Don't anthropomorphize the dog.  Wild canids live in dens, and while our dogs are domesticated some instincts remain true to them, such as prey drive, the instinct to breed, and the instinct to den.  Dogs find crates a security and place to get away from the hub bub of the family.<br>  <br>  "The crate is way small she cannot even turn around in the thing!"<br>  You need a bigger kennel.  She SHOULDN'T be able to potty in one end and sleep in the other, but the dog should be able to stand up comfortably and turn around.  Anything smaller is cruel confinement.<br>  <br>  If she's pottying in her crate, vet her and have her tested for a UTI....while this could be behavioral, puppies (especially b itches) have a tendency towards UTIs.<br>  <br>  The other thing to do is check on her frequently.  How old is she?  The general rule is that a puppy can hold it one longer hour than their age, so if she's 4 months old, she should be able to hold it for 5 hours (This IS a generalization and is not fool proof).<br>  <br>  If she's not gone potty in awhile, take her out of her kennel, potty her, play with her, and then if you must, kennel her again.|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	If she has to go & there is no place to go she will go when she has to.

Keep her confined, like in the kitchen, so as soon as she starts to pee, pick her up and bring her outside.  Make sure you praise her everytime.

3IUMh4Igaa	They breath just like you and me. They can hold their breath longer... But they do need to surface for air.|`|01nMRPHVaa	All reptiles breathe using lungs, Aquatic turtles have developed more permeable skin, and some species have modified their cloaca to increase the area for gas exchange.<br>  <br>  Turtle lungs are attached to the inside of the top of the shell (carapace), with the bottom of the lungs attached (via connective tissue) to the rest of the viscera. By using a series of special muscles (roughly equivalent to a diaphragm), turtles are capable of pushing their viscera up and down, resulting in effective respiration, since many of these muscles have attachment points in conjunction with their forelimbs (indeed, many of the muscles expand into the limb pockets during contraction). <br>  <br>  Breathing during locomotion has been studied in three species, and they show different patterns. Adult female green sea turtles do not breathe as they crutch along their nesting beaches. They hold their breath during terrestrial locomotion and breathe in bouts as they rest. North American box turtles breathe continuously during locomotion, and the ventilation cycle is not coordinated with the limb movements (Landberg et al., 2003). They are probably using their abdominal muscles to breathe during locomotion. The last species to have been studied is red-eared sliders, which also breathe during locomotion, but they had smaller breaths during locomotion than during small pauses between locomotor bouts, indicating that there may be mechanical interference between the limb movements and the breathing apparatus. <br>  <br>  Box turtles have also been observed to breathe while completely sealed up inside their shells (ibid).<br>  <br>  Most reptiles lack a secondary palate, meaning that they must hold their breath while swallowing. Crocodilians have evolved a bony secondary palate that allows them to continue breathing while remaining submerged (and protect their brains from getting kicked in by struggling prey). Skinks (family Scincidae) also have evolved a bony secondary palate, to varying degrees.<br>  <br>   Snakes took a different approach and extended their trachea instead. Their tracheal extension sticks out like a fleshy straw, and allows these animals to swallow large prey without suffering from asphyxiation.
01nMRPHVaa	I highly suggest a box turtle, there easy to obtain from a pet store. Most tortoises are not meant to be brought along with you though :-(.<br>  <br>  "The box turtle is one of the many kinds of turtles distinctive by its high convex shaped shell and a movable hinge at the bottom, thus allowing it to retract and to escape from its preys. Turtles, in general, grow slowly but have a long life expectancy. Though this seems to be good news, unfortunately, they are also one of the slowest reproducing species in the ecosystem.<br>  <br>  <br>  Box Turtle<br>  Box Turtles are adorable creatures of the wild now sold as household pets.  Taken away from their natural habitats, most of them do not survive because of the unfamiliar conditions they are forced to adapt. Outmost concern over these animals is not enough to prevent them to reach extinction. If you are a pet lover, read on to know few pointers about box turtle care.<br>  <br>  Temperature and Lighting<br>  <br>  Temperature and lighting are two very important aspects to consider in box turtle care. Unlike common family pets like dogs and cats, box turtles are cold-blooded animals. This means that they can’t regulate their own body temperature and would greatly rely on its environment to seek warmth or coldness. Because of this, it is important that you pick a shelter that is supplies both abundant sunlight and shade. In addition, temperature and lighting acts as triggering aids of your turtle’s appetite. Without their appetite, turtles would grow sick, weak and eventually die.<br>  <br>  <br>  Box Turtle<br>  Food<br>  <br>  Box Turtles are omnivores and they eat almost anything that smells edible. But this doesn’t mean that we should be negligent of their diet. Maintaining a healthy diet still plays a crucial role in box turtle care. You could feed your turtles a wide array of vegetables and fruits but make sure that it is pesticide free. Examples of vegetables and fruits that your turtles could eat are mango, clover, strawberry, apples, melon and corn. Since box turtles naturally hunt for their own food in the wild, they also eat certain types of insects like earthworms, snails, caterpillars, beetles, grasshoppers and slugs.<br>  <br>  Shelter<br>  <br>  <br>  Box Turtle<br>  Another important thing you need to know about box turtle care is providing good a shelter. A good shelter would also allow your turtles to receive the right temperature for their daily activities. It is also important to consider that most animals upon captivity die because of certain environmental changes. As much as possible, provide shelter that would give them the feeling that they are still home.<br>  <br>  Place them in the areas where the sun rises; preferably in large garden areas for a more spacious habitat. Box turtles also like skinny dipping in the water. But it is not recommended to keep them in enclosed aquariums or narrow water containers. You could install shallow ponds outside your house but make sure that the water level would not drown them.<br>  <br>  Box Turtles are only few of the captive creatures fragile to human destruction. They could become a very good pet as long as you give them your time and attention. The more you know about box turtle care, the greater chances would they be able to live longer and happier."<br>  <br>  More care guides:<br>  <a href="http://animal-world.com/encyclo/reptiles/turtles/information/boxturtlecare.php" rel="nofollow">http://animal-world.com/encyclo/reptiles...</a><br>  <a href="http://exoticpets.about.com/od/boxturtles/p/eaternboxt.htm" rel="nofollow">http://exoticpets.about.com/od/boxturtle...</a><br>  <br>  Research research research<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|cqCb7et4aa	If you really want a turtle dont care about the cost. Our turtle was obscenely expensive when we first bought it, but it was absolutely worth it! <br>  <br>  Turtles are great because they're similar to buying a fish; once you fork out for the initial set up (tank, lamps, gravel, plants, heating, etc), maintaining them costs next to nothing.

6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	I don't know much about uros but I know I had a rough time getting the heat and temps right on one of my dragons. It was suggested to me to use regular household light bulbs until I hit on the right combination. I did that and have been using them ever since. Sometimes you may have to run a couple to get it right but they are so much cheaper than what they call the basking bulb that you get in pet stores. By the way, I got this information from several bearded dragon breeders which have been doing it for years. I have had no problems and my temps are good. You might want to think about trying it. Of course my UVB is the best cause you can't do much about that. Oh and on 1 I still use a heat emitter to keep it warm enough along with a 100 watt household bulb.|`|LwZezWKmaa	why dont you try using a more powerfull bulb try a 200w or a 200w emitter?|`|f44qHe47aa	you should read your answers better. if youir such a know it all about uromastyx  and there needs then why dont you know how to heat one right?|`|01nMRPHVaa	"The temperatures in the basking spot should be very warm between 110 and 120 degrees.

Put meat in a container with lid too. Keep both in refridgerator. Put the recommended amount of kibble for age and weight into bowl and then pour 1/4 cup of broth over kibble and ad 1/4 cup of meat (more or less). Try feeding him 3x per day vs. 2x per day. You can also use rice and lowfat cottage cheese (use cottage cheese no more than 2x per week- too much isn't good for their digestion)  Also, 1 egg- cooked 2x per week too and no more.<br>  <br>  Get a good kibble such as Orijen or Blue Buffalo!  Both have higher protein levels and are organic and use only real meat- no by products which is the left over part of the cow and chicken that they didn't give to us humans, all ground up. We wouldn't eat it and neither should your dog.<br>  <br>  Most commercial pet foods have grains in them for filler.  Grains are not good for dogs and cause allergies. In the wild, dogs don't eat corn, wheat, gluten. But dog food companies put it in the food to use as a "filler". It is empty calories. Kind of like me making you Meat Loaf but really using 3/4 ground corn. What's the point?<br>  <br>  So any dog food that has corn, wheat, gluten and by products is not good for your dog.

It's not the people food that is bad, it's the kind and the time. Don't feed scraps from a table and never ad salt or spices. Plain is the game here. Top breeders insist that adding it to a well balanced kibble is excellent for their health as long as it is low fat.<br>  <br>  Even the "Dog Whisperer, and "It's me or The Dog" show have shown people how to make healthy dog stew that includes carrots and green beans!<br>  <br>  See the Dog Food Project link below.

First of all, I would try maltese & poodle  rescue agencies 1st.  If you don't find something that way, research some breeders.  Not all hybrids are THAT much more expensive than purebreds, at least for some that i looked for, though certain ones are.  I found plenty under a grand, but just like others have stated, anything over a grand is just a rip-off, like the website you listed!!  DO NOT buy a dog from that website, unless you feel like wasting more $$.  I can't believe people get away with charging so much!!!  On the other hand, don't just pay $200 to someone off of Craigslist because you don't know who you're dealing with.  I would also be careful about what hybrid breeders you find online.  Some seem pretty legit, like one i found in my area that mostly sells AKC purebreds.  But there are many others that seem too eager to just get business by the way they advertise in online ads & their websites - if i see the word "teacup" with a poor Yorkie-Poo dressed up in a silly outfit next to a teacup 1 more time, i think i'll puke.  There also seem to be a # of websites that claim to be "breeder networks", but could be (or probably are) puppy mills in disguise, so just do your homework & try to visit the breeders.  There's 1 website i found that i had considered that has puppies around $400. They ships puppies or i could've driven to it within a few hours, but i decided NOT to purchase a dog without visiting where it was raised for reasons listed.<br>  <br>  I have to agree with most of the person's response above me, & i'm laughing at this:  "Looking for a Cheap Teacup Puppy?"  Seriously, this website sounds like a scam.  Chihuahuas & Yorkies are ALREADY the smallest dogs, why do some idiots intentionally make them smaller?!?!?!?|`|6xphiZLSaa	OMG he looks just like my dog exactly!

First where are you located? Are you in Texas since I think I saw that on the picture. Do you want them as a puppy? You could look at local shelters or you could go to local pet shops. I would look in your local newspaper though there are plenty of breeders in there usually. The pet store usually jacks up the price and the newspapers there are usually dogs 500 and under.

Plus people do tend to forget things.<br>  Heartworms are a terrible thing and if there is a product to prevent them why not use it!<br>  Remember that using heartguard while the pet is positive can be dangerous. So have the pet tested(simple blooddraw) beforehand.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Once a month, but if you're dog has not been on it for a while, you'll want to get a blood test done to make sure he doesn't have heartworms before giving the preventative.  Giving the preventative to a dog that already has heartworms can be fatal.|`|ydshiNrKaa	Heartguard is given to your dog once a month for the prevention of heartworm in your dog.  You should try to give it to them every 30 days.|`|zIGbqSQqaa	once a month no more no less I give mine to my dog on the 27th of each month! hope I helped!|`|xJMhQAhfaa	Also, I assume you have had your dog tested for heartworm and it is negative. Giving heartguard to a heartworm positive dog is bad.<br>  I assume a vet told you this, but just tot be sure. :)|`|p5R1GUH1aa	Every one is right, once monthly just remember to always give the right dose, as the dog grows so does the dose needed to protect.|`|KuUx34hCaa	Read the directions once a month & make sure it's the right one for the weight of the pup or dog|`|Ad2f3Cwhaa	once every month|`|LURQBU86aa	Once a month|`|GSf09ALBaa	Every single solitary month without fail.  It takes only ONE mosquito.|`|p7swtBYzaa	Every single month without fail - best is to give it the same day of every month, say the first, so you don't forget.<br>  <br>  It's so easy and cheap to prevent heartworms and so expensive and miserable for the dog to treat it.   Infestation left alone is a death sentence for the dog slowly, and horribly.
Y5FyAekkaa	You can absolutely get some diseases like Lymes Disease and Leptospirosis from your dog but this is EXTREMELY rare. It is far more common to get a parasitic infection like coccidia or tapeworm since alot of puppies carry these. If your pet isn't sick, you aren't going to get sick. Human and animal illness are very different. Just make sure to wash your hands and don't let her lick your mouth.|`|9035ecc230615edb7a8f8452d54d7898aa	Your dog needs to be vaccinated so that it doesn't pick up any diseases from other dogs or other animals.  There are very few diseases that can be transferred to humans from pets.  Learn to wash your hands after you handle the dog.  In some states vaccinations are mandatory for dogs.  Especially the rabies vaccine.|`|p5R1GUH1aa	Look up Giardia and Zoonotic diseases  there are many things (worms) you can get from your dog  wash your hands often|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	NO!<br>  & WHY TF isn't VACCINATED????<br>  Letting it die of a preventable virus sound like a good thing,Martha?|`|NVBqiZIsaa	raybeez|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	Why isn't she vaccinated? She could give you rabies if she had it,but she could also catch parvo or distemper and die.Be responsible and get her vaccinated! You're worried about yourselves,but you don't care if the puppy gets sick and dies? You don't need a dog!
VtHvcEtuaa	Have you been to the vet about this?<br>  <br>  The dog could have dry skin, allergies, anything.  I know you said that he had a flea dip, but can you see any fleas?  Check his skin under the coat.  Is the skin red?|`|H8MGismEaa	He has probably scratched himself raw. It may be allergies. He needs a vet and a medicine bath. They will give him one.|`|ydshiNrKaa	Sounds like he has allergies.  Take him into the vet and have him checked.  My dog gets allergies on occasion and the vet scripted him dexamethasone 0.5 mg. for when it flares up.|`|p5R1GUH1aa	The chemicals in the flea dip may be to strong, try not using that and getting flea prevention nothing over the counter, try Frontline, Advantage, Advantix (not with cats in home) or a new one out called Vectra. If the dog has sensitive skin the baths are making it worse and even if you dont see a flea one flea bite can make apet scratch for weeks. Let me know if that works, also check your dogs ears, look for any kind of discharge, ear infections are a possibility|`|DYxb7P3Baa	allergies? dry skin ? hot spot ?|`|QEaoW8nUaa	He might have dry skin, give him a bath with Dog Oatmeal Shampoo|`|efr4JlWJaa	Hello, <br>  I am a pet nutrition specialist for Nutro Products Inc., I would like to provide you with some information that might help you answer your question. You might want to consider looking into the foods that you feed your dog, because some ingredients can cause irritation in the skin that causes a dog to: scratch, shed, and have hot spots. A couple of suggestions in terms of what you can look into feeding are: Nutro's Natural Choice Venison and whole brown rice, Herring and Potato, or Nutro's Chicken Rice and Oatmeal formulas. These are formulated for dogs with sensitive skin and stomachs and can improve the skin condition within weeks of feeding. These foods are natural and don't contain fillers or by-products that some other foods have that could cause these symptoms in your pet. You can find these foods in stores like petsmart or petco. I hope this helps!|`|3WhEyA8Taa	well I don't know what a flea dip is.... but my dog groomer told be that when you wash your dog leave the flea and tick shampoo on for 10 to 15 minutes maybe the dip didn't get all of them?? Or my dog once had a rash and was itching, but that was because she kept eating strawberries from our patch and was allergic. Maybe your dog is allergic to something.
Go0ydYwGaa	get a beagle if u luv sports, there r 2 many dogs 2 choose from! i personally think the Labradors and golden retrievers r the best! #1 choice in U.S.A!!!!|`|AA10247494	Personally out of the two I love great danes. They are a lot of fun and great dogs to own. The only downside is they seem to get arthritis and hip displasia more than other dogs.<br>  <br>  I also love Wiemeriners. The "grey ghost" is a fun energetic large breed that is very playful throughout life and is great to train and is good in a family environment. I'd highly reccomend this breed. They are longer lived than most of the much bigger breeds and they are great.|`|AA10400143	Great danes are said to be very sweet and loyal, however the have a problem with the stomach turning & hip displasha (most big dogs do). If you get one, make sure it is from a good breeder who tests hips.|`|p5R1GUH1aa	have you thought of a greyhound? They can even be aprtment dogs with their calm nature and I am sure they would love to RUN in the yard. There are adoption groups to help place the right one with the right person|`|J54HawZyaa	a great dane, they are amazing dogs|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Great danes are great dogs but actually laid back & couch potatoes so they don't need a lot of space.  Shibas do need space & are great escape artists & have a very high prey drive.  Unless you do a lot of reading & research into shibas don't get one - you won't be prepared.  This ia great link by shiba owner with the real  pros & cons of owning a shiba.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://shibainus.ca/chapter-3-should-you-get-a-shiba/" rel="nofollow">http://shibainus.ca/chapter-3-should-you...</a><br>  <br>  Danes are certainly much more quiet than shibas.  These are 2 very different breeds of dogs so you need to be more research in your choices.  Shibas are difficult to train compared to most dogs & are not for novice owners. I adopted 2 danes & 1 shiba & hope to adopt another dane this year.  Can't say I would adopt another shiba anytime soon.|`|JpH6FAlBaa	A Dane would be an excellent choice for you..they are very loyal and loving. I personally have 6 dogs and one is a Great Pyrenees so I am inclined to tell people how great they are but my second choice was a Dane, just couldn't find a breeder at the time so went with the Pyr. Our other dogs are herding dogs which are terribly smart but have to work or they get destructive. A greyhound is a good choice but you have to be careful with them as they are high instinct to chase and lol hard to catch up to.
xTT13wFmaa	when shes used to your house. then take her for frequent short walks. she'll gradually be able to walk longer|`|11PAFD9Caa	Its best to wait until she has had all her necessary shots. Ask your Vet....|`|bU2TrMxgaa	It really depends. If you have your own yard and you know that there is no chance of there having been any dog with parvo on your property then you can take her out for walks there. If you live in an apartment or the city and you would be walking her where there are all sorts of dogs being walked, then I would wait a couple more months.|`|6LMeXaTeaa	I have a 5 and a half month old puppy, and he is taken for walks but not too long. I suggest that you start walking her in a month or so on a short walk and slowly extend the length that you take her.<br>  Hope I helped. Good luck with your little one!:)|`|QJsyw1EVaa	You shouldn't walk her until she has finished her full puppy vaccination schedule.
KuUx34hCaa	I always stay with my dogs to make sure every thing goes ok & help them some with cleaning up the pups as I have had them deliver the next one before she could get the previous one all cleaned up you can make sure the pups are kept to the side while she is delivering the next one|`|PM23RDycaa	Sure go to bed, And when you wake up in the morning to find dead or dying pups and their dead or dying mother you can pat yourself on the back.<br>  <br>  Why the heck do you have a pregnant animal if you don't know what YOU are supposed to do?|`|bIaywrBCaa	you should stay awake in case you need to help her or if she needs to go to the vet!!|`|bfe89b40e0344af279288338e469b235aa	YOU are elected midwife you accepted that position when you allowed your dog to get preg. - you stay up and help clean pups & cut the cords ect.<br>  <br>  Besides if  you could actually sleep this litter is not important enough to you and you shouldn't breed  (if for no other reason to see how many & what sex pups)|`|xRa4XNFaaa	Yes, because something might go wrong.  And if one of the puppies dies, the mother will not go near any of them, (same with all animals).  And if the mother does that then all of the puppies will starve until you wake up.|`|kN4EaiUDaa	yes you need to stay awake incase something happens and you need to rush the mom or the puppies to the vet. also if you were in labor wouldnt you want comfort and someone to be there with you. she's probably going to be scared|`|sosYw7Z5aa	Yes, stay with her to make sure there are no complications, too many things can go wrong. By being there you possibly can save a life.|`|FXDTj87Iaa	Stay awake, you wouldnt leave your wife by herself in the hospital while giving birth. Your dog may leave a mess or might need help.|`|BNKBs4Peaa	Yes, stay awake. You may need to help her give birth (pull, etc.). If something goes wrong, you need to be there with her! =)|`|8MuDruTlaa	Stay awake incase of complications and to make sure every goes okay.

VtHvcEtuaa	The dog needs to be seen immediately by a vet!|`|ydshiNrKaa	this is perfectly normal for pups after being given de worming medication.|`|OnZDg0AEaa	hi,<br>  <br>  Just about every dog on the planet is infested with worms to some degree. If they stay at low levels, your dog can build up immunity to them. But if the infestation reaches a certain point, worms can cause anemia, lethargy, poor appetite, and even death. Fortunately, almost all worms can be detected by a vet and treated with medication.<br>  here's more info:<br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/worms.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/worms.html</a><br>  <br>  hope this helps.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	After you worm pups, the worms do come out ... <br>  <br>  Most breeders don't let the pups go until AFTER the worms have finished coming out, but if she just wormed them, this is normal.  Gross, but normal.|`|df378c28318ff6097f7f272b0367e6cbaa	Its really not a big deal, all puppies get worms!  Just have the vet worm him again and he'll be fine.  It can take several courses especially if the puppy gets reinfected by eating poop or via fleas.|`|Y5FyAekkaa	The breeder is sort of correct but i just wanted to expand upon what she told you.  Healthy worms are going to stay and live inside your dog. What you are seeing is likely dead and dying worms. I get aggravated about the "dewoming" generalization because many over the counter dewomers only address one type of worms. Each species of worms requires a different remedy. You need to have ur vet perform a "fecal floatation" to identify exactly which worm she has and provide you with the right medication. The runny stool is also just a factor of the worms, not a major concern at the moment.|`|Kdr8okbAaa	oh my gosh! no way! that could mean that it could be dying! those worms that r popping out must be gross but those worms can possibly be eating his/her insides which could lead to a heart problem or death and also possibly bleeding from the inside. i would schedule an operation to open the puppy and make sure babies aren't being born cuz more worms, closer to poor puppy death. Give that por little puppy as much ove as possible! i hope it will be okay!|`|IKKAokDxaa	my puppy just got dewormed, and his poo was dry-ish, and it had DEAD worms, because they are supposed to be dead when they come out, because the de-wormer kills the worms, so they come out. I don't think that's normal. Take her to the vet ASAP!!|`|BbYywLrTaa	yea everything is normal thats like the only way to get the worms out of the dogs system is pooping so yea it might take awhile. the pup may have been born with worms but its alright|`|8MuDruTlaa	We've had a few puppies, and a couple of them had worms when we go them too. You should go to the vet, because they can give to antibiotics. (:|`|pgIDcxXxaa	dont worry ,the vaccine she had may be working and that is why shes dishcharging them,keep an eye on her,if it seemsto irritate her,let the vet decide|`|788sif5baa	That is definitely NOT normal. I doubt that your pup got anything like de worming shots! <br>  <br>  GO TO THE VET RIGHT AWAY!
t9Fxx75uaa	If your dog is relaxed, has a good appetite, not aggressive, playful, loving, perky, licks you, gets regular exercise, and just seems comfortable then it is happy.  Signs of an unhappy dog are timidness, aggressiveness, depression, growling, not wanting to play or go for walks etc.|`|fFOzNY6jaa	Typically, when your dog his happy you can tell, if he is outside or something and you walk outside does he run to you? is he aggressive to you? somewhat like a kid, you know if he likes you, but if you are nice to him, and take care of him properly and pay attention to him he should love you :D<br>  <br>  (not sure if its a he or she) :D i have a male dog.
kceGobAXaa	I agree with Cassidy.  You sound worried so take him to the emerg.  Better safe than sorry.|`|bIaywrBCaa	it could be many things. He could have food lodged in his throat or may have swallowed something else. He might have pneumonia. If it was my dog, I would take him to the ER vet tonight.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	It could be several things.  An infection, cancer, lung disease, upper respiratory problems, 'kennel cough', heart failure..... just too many things that could potentially cause this.  Make sure he doesn't have something stuck in his throat that is causing him to breathe heavily, cough and gag.  He could be choking.|`|BNKBs4Peaa	Possible Diagnosises:<br>  *Respitory Infection<br>  *Allergic Reaction<br>  *Sickness/Poisonous Infection<br>  *Old Age/ Getting Weak<br>  <br>  All of these are too hard to fix unproffesionally. You will have to wait until the vet.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	****************************************... <br>  Call the emergency vet, and take your dog there NOW!<br>  **************************************...<br>  <br>    He is in pain, and has a serious problem.

If he hasnt been eating the shaking could be caused by being hypoglycemic. Meaning he needs sugar in his body. Hypoglycemia can cause seizures as well... I dont know if you are describing a seizure or not. Since he has been gagging I suppose he could have somthing lodged in his throat . . . But since he is shaking and breathing hard you should take him in asap. Sounds like he may be getting critical and I see things like this all the time.  owners wait too long to take their dogs in and then things get really bad ya know :( Good luck|`|0WuXhCTSaa	Taking him to the vet is the only way to know what's going on.<br>  We turn to eachother for answers sometimes, but when it comes to anything medical, but best bet is always a vet.|`|5Gr1TpMKaa	Could be upper respiratory infection.

vUiUoamVaa	if you Google the phrase "free websites to advertise dogs" you will get a lot of hits.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&gfns=1&ie=UTF-8&rls=GGLG,GGLG:2005-30,GGLG:en&q=free+websites+to+advertise+puppies" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=na...</a><br>  <br>  I honestly cannot recommend one over another since I have not advertised any dogs for sale on the internet for years.|`|Clt9uTmNaa	www.petfinder.com  That's the largest online pet website.  I believe it's free.<br>  <br>  Also I would suggest contacting your local no kill shelters.  Some of them will take them off your hands, and will be able to do in depth research on potential families to ensure the puppies go to a good home.  Your local Petsmart will have a few shelters they refer to.|`|Su0LaNhoaa	You can put it in your local newspaper.  if your in jersey i may be able to help, i am a hairstylist and know lots of people and i could ask if anyone is interested.  also you could ask friends to help who have myspace and facebook to put something on there page.  Im not sure any sites like craigslist but im sure they are out there.  And if your not from jersey tell your local hairstylist.  They are excellent people for trying to sell/give away stuff.|`|PQufLphDaa	i use craigslist and hoobly.com works really well to
wUg7iYU1aa	It seems to be a pretty good bed, machine washable, protected, good for indoor and outdoor....Looks fine.|`|0WuXhCTSaa	I don't want to say you got ripped off, but I have bought many for my dogs over the years, and I have spent alot of money.   I find none of them last that long, and are way over priced.  I went to a dollar store in my area, and I was happy to see they sold many items for pets including blankets.  I bought about ten and I can throw them in the washer and the price was great.  $1:00<br>  As long as my dogs were comfortable I was happy.  I find most products that are sold for dogs and other pets are just mainly appealing to us, the pets don't care, so why pay more than you have to.|`|tMtBe1lKaa	I haven't had those kind, but they look like a good price. I got mine from Costco fo 11.99 for a ex large. (I have a lab). I actually bought them before the dog though to use as "gamer pillows" when the kids are playing or watching t.v. They were really comfy and matched my decor. I've had them 2+ years. My dog loves them and they have a zipper for easy cleaning. I've only cleaned them once though, and they came out fine. <br>  Have fun. Your dog will thank you either way!|`|05805cd7f8ba800b6b1e4c9525a624bcaa	I think as long as the dog likes it that's all that matters.

I am looking at a dog bed and you asked about a dog blanket.?|`|TSQxwlbraa	It looks like a pretty good deal to me.|`|zICgiPUcaa	the bed looks nice and cozy and affordable too. none of the beds i've seen so far have been less that 30$|`|pTD05NBKaa	it doesn't look baad!!<br>  I HATE looking for dog beds!! i always look at the pictures and how fluffy the bed always looks, but once I FEEL the actual product I get annoyed and turn around. Reasonably priced dog beds are flimsy and thin. (I tend to like mattress type beds) or at least something that isn't paper thin. With my dogs I usually buy blankets and fold/layer them. They work better and are easier to wash in my opinion. Wait `till you get the bed &lemme know how thick it is!|`|ylsx7pRHaa	if they do as they say, inany event they look comfy I reckon they look great ! might look at a couple for my dogs.|`|xzr33wNzaa	it looks like a pillow >.<|`|pPit2IQ4aa	u got ripped off sucka ...!!!! =(|`|tPGxPDvBaa	They looks decent to me but I'm not sure what the exchange rate from Australia dollars to US dollars is.

2YIxnXXyaa	I feed my pond about four times a day.  That's mainly because some turtles are out during the afternoon and some in the evening.  But usually the same one eats each time.<br>  Try to feed them twice a day, and keep about five to ten small goldfish in the tank at all times just in case it is hungry when you're gone it'll have something to munch on.<br>  I would feed him about ten to twenty pellets in the morning and in the evening.  If she gets hungry in between, that's what the fish are for.<br>  <br>  Also tadpoles, ghost shrimp, guppies, goldfish, and/or minnows.  Those are all good for turtles so just put a few of those in there and they should be good to go.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped, good luck.<br>  Oh and btw, turtles are ALWAYS hungry, they're little piggies in disguise.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ...That is a horrible version of a middle finger.|`|ld2vmypNaa	<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/29035692@N03/sets/72157614552292977/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/29035692@N0...</a><br>  <br>  Aquatic Turtles are a life long commitment.<br>  <br>  ‘Austinsturtlepage.com’ has all info on care and feeding for an eastern painted turtle.<br>  <br>  ***They MAINLY eat FISH for their diet along with fruits and veggies every other day or so..<br>  <br>  Get more fish.<br>  <br>  Food container?<br>  <br>  <br>  They NEED calcium and protein they get it from the fish meat and the fish bones.

nG3RCbZTaa	I'm not sure how much they go for where you come from but from breeding a bumblebee to a normal you have:<br>  25% chance of spiders<br>  25% chance of pastels<br>  25% chance of bumblebees<br>  25% chance of normals|`|8i90ov0Gaa	Baby bumblebee ball pythons sell for about $800 to $1000 from breeders, so your friend has one heck of a good friend. Breeding a bumblebee to a normal will give you the odds Calvin mentioned. You'll get approximately 25% of the clutch being normals, 25% being pastels, 25% spiders, and 25% bumblebees. These aren't guarantees. And considering ball pythons only average 4 to 6 eggs, you may or may not get one of each morph I listed.
j8VSZudZaa	Well your cage is ok if there aren't an overload of toys in it. One of my budgies is kept in a cage roughly this size, maybe a bit wider but she has separate playgym on top of it where all her toys are, I let her out half the time, so the time spent in the cage is only for sleeping which is ok. If your budgie is permanently caged, please get a much larger cage length x width wise with plenty of toys please. :)|`|wF52XMxAaa	Not really.  I'd want at least 18" long x 12" wide x 15" high if your bird spends a lot of time out of the cage, and more if it's spending most of its time inside.  Bigger is better.<br>  <br>  Hallowsweets answer, btw, works out to about 18"x12"x12".  Your cage doesn't really need to be longer than it is high.  If it's long enough, extra height won't hurt your bird; it's just that extra height can't make up for a cage that's not long or wide enough.

But if you want to protect your dog.. you should at very very least get distemper and parvo as well..|`|ydshiNrKaa	Puppies should receive immunity against some diseases through their mothers milk but this disappears during the first few months of their life. To protect puppies during this critical time, a well-researched approach is taken: A series of vaccines is given every 3 to 4 weeks until the chance of contracting an infectious disease is very low. The typical vaccine is a "combination" that protects against canine distemper virus, canine adenovirus, parainfluenza, and canine parvovirus (the four viruses are commonly abbreviated DHPP). <br>  <br>  Many veterinarians also recommend incorporating leptospirosis in the vaccination series (this combination is abbreviated DHLPP). <br>  Rabies vaccines are given between 16 and 26 weeks of age in most states (governed by law).|`|d97e0d7c192c0cd5634d474777b47535aa	Talk to your vet, normally you can get a 7way shot to give a few times and you pup will be good for a while. The important ones are parvo, distemper and a few others. Rabies comes a bit later I believe. Also, get it spayed (before she goes into heat for the first time) or neutered.|`|tMtBe1lKaa	definitely parvo. You should do this ASAP. It could get it when you go to the park or even in your own back yard if there was a dog who had it before there. It's a real killer, so protect your pup. <br>  <br>  Go to the vet and ask what they reccommend for your area. Some diseases are more common that others- depends on where you live. To have the dog liscenced, you have to give it a rabies shot as well. I think you have to wait until a certain age though- 3 months? not sure. Ask vet for best info.|`|nHp8zzkjaa	All of them, the reason they have the shots is to protect your dog. He can catch a deadly disease just by being in a area where a dog had it and vacc. prevent that.<br>  <br>  Rabies<br>  bordetella<br>  Parvo<br>  Dhppl|`|dFNaSqBUaa	Ravies & parvo|`|bsEIFCZFaa	Hi,<br>  I work for a shelter and would stress the DHLPP (they need 3, the main one and then the boosters) , which is the puppy vaccine.  It protects from the biggie "Parvo" a terrible disease in dogs.  Puppies and older dogs are the ones that suffer the greatest.  Pups usually die and it's a terrible death.  They basically dehydrate to death.  It's very bad.  <br>  <br>  Next is your Rabies.<br>  <br>  If you live in an area where there is Lymes Disease, you will need that vaccine too.  If you don't then it's not recommended.<br>  <br>  Call a local vet and they can give you a complete list of vaccines they recommend for your area.  But the DHLPP and Rabies are the main 2 in my opinion!<br>  <br>  Hope that helps :)  Good luck with your new pup.  Also, just a word of advice, if you plan on spay/neuter, do it while they are young.  They recover much faster and better than waiting.|`|0WuXhCTSaa	You have got alot of good answers, but one other thing which is a good idea is to get your pup protection from kennal cough.  It can kill your dog.  It is a very serious issue.

Xy1XH5gVaa	Add some fresh meat to your cats diet.|`|fIsjIMZHaa	i give my cats 3/4 cup each a day and wt food at night.  neither are over weight one is 8 lbs one is 11lbs  It depends on what you are feeding them.

2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	Buy a crate and crate train her.<br>  <br>  Add: Hmm, it seems some folk don't understand what crate training involves.  You take the pup outside to potty and if she doesn't oblige you pop her in the crate for 10 minutes and then take her outside again.<br>  Most puppies do not soil in their crates.|`|AA10233318	It takes time, perhaps a month or so in some cases. Buy a crate and purchase some pads, watch her carefully after eating. Many tips below:|`|0WuXhCTSaa	First of all, you need two things.  A crate to put your puppy in and it shouldn't be much bigger than the dog.  The reason for this is because they won't go where they sleep.  Buy some puppy pads, they are great.  Don't buy them at pet stores cause they are more expensive there.   Your pup should be crated when you sleep, not all day.  <br>  Also, the pup should not be allowed to run all over your home.  Use one area, for about a month or so, and in that space the dog will have it's food and water bowls and puppy pad.  <br>  <br>  When you take your pup out of the crate each morning, put the pup on the pad.  If he pee's somewhere else, whipe it up with the pad and leave it on the floor.  The pup will soon pick up the scent and pee on the pad.  When the pup does this, make a huge fuss over it and give the pup a treat.  Do this every time he pee's on the pad.  Don't yell or hit the pup if he pee's anywhere else, ignore it cause any attention you give the dog is seen as positive attention to the dog.   Pups need alot of rest, so crating him during the day off and on is a good idea, but if your not home to do that, that confine the dog to one area.  Don't let the pup run around the house.  It just is a matter of creating a routine and sticking to it.  I have done this with many dogs and it works.<br>  Good luck.|`|UdICTUnaaa	i hope that you considered all the walking you have to do with a dog<br>  <br>  your puppy must be on a strict food and water and walk time until she is trained... dont leave the food and water down for her.... feed her 2 or 3 times a day at the same time every day... and take her out to walk 10 minutes after she eats.... same with water but offer it with the food and a couple more times throughout the day<br>  <br>  the key is consistancy! dogs need routine... anything else is confusing to them|`|3d7rK5Z4aa	I wouldn't Crate train her! this confuses them. teach her to do what you want her to do in the first place or she won't know where to go. Take her outside every hour and once or twice at night or put her in her carrier at night. She will learn eventually that that's what she's supposed to do. It only took my dog a couple weeks to figure this out. but if they're really young sometimes it takes a while for them to be able to control it. just take her outside every hour and this may take 10 to 20 minutes per time you take her out. but if you do this then she will be better about potty training in the long run.And don't forget to reward her and brag on her a bunch when she does it!|`|zWFJBlJZaa	Keep her in a non-carpeted area!!!!<br>  <br>  Please download and read this FREE book:<br>  <a href="http://www.dogstardaily.com-train-aft" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogstardaily.com-train-aft</a><br>  and they tell you everything you need to know about raising your puppy (and they give you schedules)!!!<br>  <br>  Good luck, have fun, and enjoy your new buddy!|`|pkNZkpqaaa	You need to train her to go in one spot. If you live where she can easily be left outdoors then put newspaper down in front of the door she is to be left out of. If she doesn't go on the paper, then when she wets put a piece of paper on the wet spot and then transfer it to the place by the door. She will go to the scent and then when you see her by the door you can take her out. Be PATIENT this will take some time to teach her. Some puppies learn quick and others don't. Also sometimes puppies get urinary infections that make it impossible to totally train them but are easily cured with a simple antibiotic so make sure that you rule out that possibility before you give up by having a vet. check her. Take her out right after her naps and after her meals. Have fun with her and she will be your bud for life.|`|UlwswPliaa	Haha well thats a puppy (; i just got one myself hes 6months old and USED to pee everywhere! Well the first time he peed we put dog pads at the exact spot and the next time he had to go he smelled his sense their from before and didnt miss the spot. He has around 2 spots in the house where we have to put the dog pads. First we closed him in a area so he knows thats the only area he can pee it wasnt a small one it was like in my living room. have fun with your puppy|`|zICgiPUcaa	you should try using training pads. they attract the dog with their smell and they get used to peeing and pooping only in that area. if you have the time, you can also try taking your dog out in the morning and right after he has had his meal.
5TM9P8tsaa	*On my vision quest I met Jesus. There were animals in heaven. He told me everything that God, and the Goddess created has a soul. So yes.|`|AA10129150	No one knows. Some animals seem to have much more feeling than some people. Some religions teach that animals do not have souls, other teach that they do. Some religions are based on animals having souls, so that when you get reincarnated you can come back as an animal. It is really based on what you believe, there isn't even any proof people have souls, it is just something that people believe.|`|XI2iylR4aa	I was raised Catholic, and on one Ash Wednesday I went to church.  The priest was talking about how a lot of people asked to bring their pets in to get ashes.   He said that they won't bless pets because they don't have souls.<br>  <br>  So, that was my last day as a Catholic.<br>  <br>  I don't know exactly what I believe, but if humans have souls, then animals do too.  I think it's ridiculous to say that humans are the only beings that are high enough to go to heaven.  So if your church is telling you that animals don't have souls, and you want to believe that they do, I think you should continue to believe it.  You don't HAVE to believe everything you hear at church.|`|mnsuJ1MXaa	I think just like you or I might have different beliefs about what happens when people die, different people have different beliefs regarding animals as well.  I believe so, yes!  But I guess I could answer your question with another question and say, why would you think they don't?  They are a living breathing being who shares this earth with the rest of us aren't they?  In the church they are "god's creatures" no?  So for some idiot in a church to say that animals don't have souls, I have to question that persons thought process and they're credibility with they're version of god(whichever they choose).<br>  The more I think about it, humans despite what we like to believe, are anything but a superior race.  We have invaded and trashed this planet much like cockroaches take over a filthy house.  As a race people act as if we're owed our life on our home we like to call earth and it's disturbing.  I don't think most people realize just how insignificant we are, and how simply we could be wiped clean, and we are speeding down a path of destruction that's become very close to ireversable.  The human race has disturbed the natural order of mother earth and in the words of Death Cab For Cutie, it's just a matter of time before we all burn.  <br>  Of coarse animals have souls, why the hell not?  What Say's we are better than them, or that we deserve a soul over the dog or any animal we may keep as a pet?  Actually judging by the general population, our history on this planet and the constant lack of respect for our resources, I'd be more likely to say any given person lacks a soul in comparison to our furry little friends.  <br>  But then again, who the hell am I to share my thoughts when the Christian church is out to pollute the minds of the public and brainwash our children.  I'm sure it differs from person to person just as any belief does.|`|GcvNxfYFaa	i like to believe they go to heaven.  i do hope and pray so.  i hope when i die i'll have my pets waiting on me as well as all the other animals. to me, thats a reasonable belief but obviously i have no solid proof.|`|cnMk2jWAaa	yes. <br>  Have you even looked into the eyes of an animal, espicially a dog?<br>  That's how I know they do.<br>  and the heaven thing is a personal belief thing.|`|5p4Zv83eaa	Some animals love and care for each other.  Many animals (such as dogs) are much more sacrificial than many human beings with "souls" whom I know. Some animals give up their lives for their babies, but some humans with "souls" kill their kids. Numerous love stories were told about penguins, and these beat my own stories. :) I am convinced that animals have souls, and these souls are much more loving that those of many human beings. Thus, I do believe that there will be animals in heaven.|`|GgihQmeWaa	That's a ridiculous question to ask because first of all, nobody knows for sure if heaven even exists. Second of all, if you do believe in heaven, of course they have souls! They have feelings and emotions. They can touch, they can hear, they can smell, and they can see. They have a brain, just like us...but not as developed. Every animal has a soul, the way I think of it. In fact, you might've been an animal in your past life, even! Animals might become humans in their next lives. Nobody knows this for a fact, and scientists would say this wasn't scientifically proven, but if you believe in souls, heaven, and the past lives you could agree with me.<br>  <br>  I personally don't think it's a good idea to post this question on Yahoo Answers, because nobody could really answer it. No one knows for sure what happens when a person dies, let alone an animal. Believe what you want to believe.|`|Z2vlRSzpaa	Of coarse they do! Any animal loved and cared for all have souls!<br>  <br>  We are animals...and they are animals.......So if we don't have souls........then they don't.<br>  <br>  But we have souls.

CJMhtM7maa	I train or refresh all my dogs at the same time.It seems to go a lot faster at times.The younger ones learn from the older ones.Let your pups have their play time,when they calm down then start your training session.Remember your pups attention span is very short.Try starting off with having them sit before you feed them,have their bowls in hand,tell them to sit,soon they will sit and wait till you feed.Food works wonders,remember it all takes time and patience.Good Luck.|`|akqzdLA8aa	We have been trying to house train ours for a year.

We have leash for her to go out and we praise her when she "tinkles" outside, she even has an older dog that is perfectly house trained to model after but she just doesn't get it.

Keep the concentration of the treat not being given to the one that has to wait.

PSiNv7gUaa	First of all, a 50-foot snake?  Somebody better call Ripley's, cause they're never gonna believe it!!  Second, depending on the size of the dog, just feeding a large snake one dog would be enough to keep it full for 1-3 months.  A snake would refuse to eat any more until that meal was fully digested.

45a2d78be5d5ed4c4b9533acffae073baa	Cats may sometimes get in a crib with a baby to keep warm but they don't smother anyone on purpose.  Yes it's a myth.  <br>  While cats are predators and will kill things like mice and birds they have no homicidal tendencies toward humans.  I suppose it would be possible, although highly improbable, for a feral cat in a panic to scratch a human so deeply that they severed an artery and the person bled to death but that would not be murder.|`|VebGHrysaa	no|`|yH0QjJQRaa	Thankfully the suffocation of babies is a myth, considered to be from when someone placed their babies belly down to sleep, which can lead to Sudden Death Syndrome.<br>  <br>  That being said, I have seen babies badly scratched by cats when they are too enthusiastically played with.  It is best to limit the baby's availability to cats unless you are watching closely.|`|aN4SUKkRaa	Not a myth, whether urban or from outside the city limits, there have been many cases of cats suffocating babies. As for motive, the cat usually lies on top of the baby for warmth. But dogs have been known to maul new born babies to death -- usually when they were owned by a childless couple for many years and a baby arrives and takes all the attention that was previously lavished on the dog. There is no reason for a cat to not feel the same jealousy and take matters into its own hands (or should that take be "matters into its own paws"?)<br>  <br>  A cat did "murder" an elderly man recently in the news. From a witness account (the man's wife) she heard the man yell from the yard, "That bloody cat just scratched me leg!". The cat ran inside soaking wet. She assumed that her husband had turned the hose on the cat which he had done on numerous previous occasions. About 15 minutes later she took her husband a cup of tea outside and found him lying in the yard. The cat had struck the femoral artery in his thigh and he had bled to death!!

Bettas are tropical fish that thrive in temperatures in the low 80's, that's impossible in a vase because there is no heater in a vase. When the temperature is lower than his natural environment, their metabolism slow down, making food undesirable. Bettas are better off in at least a 2.5 gallon with a heater and sponge filter.|`|lXpGlAm3aa	I had a Beta fish for 2 years.I loved him! I named him "Bing" from a children's book.Anyhow,I cleaned his water every morning, faithfully.I figured if I was a  fish I wouldn't want to be swimming around in filth.<br>  Just keep trying to feed him.Put 2 or 3 pieces of food drops on the surface and see if he swims up to eat.He might feel nervous if you are standing there watching him eat.Some Beta's are very shy.<br>  Maybe try and start feeding him two times a day.Morning and night.I did.My Beta was spoiled rotten.<br>  Well good luck,because I was pretty upset when Bing passed away.They are a pet just like any other pet.
a2cjwMKcaa	Test strips are OK for pH, it's not really that important. You want to know if it's gone to some extreme, but as long as it's in the 'normal' range (6 - 8) and you have common fish, no worries.<br>  <br>  Oxygen levels is difficult to measure, think expensive machines. Generally just make sure the tank has good water circulation and assume it will be OK. If you are worried, add an extra bubble wand just to make sure.<br>  <br>  More important things to check are the nitrogen cycle chemicals. Thats where most problems occur. Test for ammonia (very toxic), Nitrite (toxic) and Nitrate ( slightly toxic).<br>  <br>  Those are the things that cause the most problems and you should keep an eye on.<br>  <br>  Ian|`|8owlj2xHaa	Test PH with a good and easy to use kit, like Salifert. They are more expensive, but are the easiest to use. Ph needs to be tested at 2 different times of the day. In the morning, near lights on, and at night near lights out. Ph is time of day sensative. As the lights are on algae in the tank take in co2 and put out oxygen, which increases ph levels. Over night with lights out there is less oxygen being added to the water, which lowers ph levels. You need to know what the high the and low levels are.<br>  You do not want to low of a level, going to high is harder for a tank to do but still needs to be checked. You also want to check your alkalinity levels as PH is a direct result of your alkalinity levels. After you check your tanks levels of alkalinity, check your new water source as well.|`|oMmBhWK4aa	All serious aquarists and responsible ones should invest in water testing kits. Suggest not to rely on those all-in-one test strips that are rather iffy to read though they are cheaper. It's worth the expense to buy separate kits to measure common parameters (pH, ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, gH and kH). Planted tank owners should also measure CO2 content. Measuring O2 is more unusual but there's also a measuring kit for that. Better to buy kits from reputable brands like API, Tetra, Sera etc. <br>  <br>  A more expensive alternative for pH is to get a pH measuring pen for faster digital readings. Good for the impatient or those with cash to burn, but you need to calibrate it every now and then. There are also digital monitors that are placed into the tank for real-time constant readings but those are similarly expensive and overkill for most aquarists.
yH0QjJQRaa	Oddly enough, I've seen a lot of cats do this.  Many cats prefer to drink from flowing water.  There are some great watering devices that continually give cats fresh moving water.  I believe that it is in part due to their great sense of smell.<br>  <br>  There is a great catalog called - Doctors Foster and Smith "Just for Cats"<br>  has some great products.  1-800-826-7206 or DrsFosterSmith.com|`|quPY9x7qaa	cats love running water, and they like clean water. that's where this action comes from, just like their larger counterparts lions, tigers, etc., they paw at the water to clear the top for a drinking place. when they scrape around their bowl after eating they're "covering it up" to keep other predators from finding it.|`|NFyddSd5aa	Wow! Two of mine do that too! I thought they were the only ones! Mine scratch the floor with one paw a few times before they drink, I have always wondered why. Maybe marking territory, they have scent glands in their paws.|`|lx79GmcKaa	My kitten does that in front of the bowl too! quite odd, but i think i know why, not positive but possible!<br>  <br>   I think he is like claiming his territory|`|85pp4KGiaa	My cat sticks her paw to the bottom of the water bowl before drinking it.

Either a paw dip test and the paw outside the bowl, how deep it is.<br>  When they do that after they have eaten, means they are "cleaning up".  <br>  <br>  love<br>  peppa

t6Ya3c3baa	My largest cage (aka The Palace), originally housed Sam and his sons Coaly, (Krispy) Kareem, Ivan (awful itch), Victor, and Yancy. That was six male rats who got along just fine, and  were known as the Palace Boys. These males were placed into The Palace at the same time; in order to get them away from Zoe when she had another litter.<br>  <br>  When the four males from that litter were big enough to need separating from their mother and sisters, I tried to introduce them into The Palace. Big mistake. The big brothers attacked their younger brothers {intruder alert, intruder alert}. That is the only time I had any real fighting in The Palace. I quickly removed Charlie(coal), Dagwood, and their two unnamed brothers from The Palace; and placed them into an inadequate container (it was all I had available) below The Palace, which became known as The Dungeon.<br>  <br>  Last Spring I gave away Dagwood, the two unnamed Dungeon boys, Yancy, and Ivan, which left me with four males in The Palace (and only Charlie left in The Dungeon); with the remaining Palace boys still all getting along fine. Last Fall Kareem (a beige) passed on,  for no discernible reason, there were no wounds. Then this past Winter Sam, my foundation male, passed on, probably from old age.<br>  <br>  Now, The Palace only holds my two oldest rats, the brothers Coaly and Victor, who are still getting along perfectly well. Of course, they have spent their entire lives together. Prince Charming Charlie(coal) still lives in a Dungeon below The Palace; but, while it is still inadequate, it is better than what he had before. I am working on a new cage for Charlie.<br>  <br>  My fourth male, Remi, has his own cage which I am getting ready for a visit from Alice. Currently, Alice lives alone next door to The Palace. Remi and Alice are my two youngest rats.<br>  <br>  My females are in cages separate from the males, though in the same room.|`|GuOJIftAaa	Mightypower7 Doesn't know what she's talking about.<br>  <br>  I have 3 male rats that were ALL bought at different times, aren't related and there aren't any females around and they have never fought a day in their life. They're always all piled up together and love to play.<br>  I know people that have upwards of 20 male only rats and never have fights. Sure, there will be the occasional male rat that has issues, but its not a sure thing that they'll fight.<br>  <br>  Spaying a female where I live is $150 but it mostly depends on where you live.|`|yn37MLwnaa	Male rats will not generally fight. I have had rats in the past, and my friend has rats(two males that have lived together for quite a while). Males do just fine together, and are extremely social. We currently have three males living together that adore one another. <br>  <br>  However, in just about every other rodent species, males will often fight. Rats seem to be one of the exceptions to the rule.|`|dvJYp7YAaa	First of all, I am a rat breeder, and I keep all my males together. They usually don't have any problems.<br>  <br>  You need to properly introduce them if you want them to live/play together. You can put them in a neutral place, like your bed or the bathtub until they get to know each other. This usually takes a few minutes. If they don't start fighting, then they are going to be fine. If they do fight, then you should separate them in different cages and try again the next day. This might take up to a week. (Make sure you are quarantining them first. If you don't, you should spread infection or disease).<br>  <br>  After that, they should be fine.<br>  <br>  To take an exotic (rats) into see the vet, it usually costs between $50 - $80. Then, if you want them to be spayed, it's usually around $200 - $300 because of the anesthetic. Rodents don't do so well under anesthetics. <br>  <br>  I would just separate them, but that's just me. It would be cheaper. <br>  <br>  Oh, and after the spaying/neutering, you want to keep them separated until the stitches are gone. That way, if there is any wrestling or fighting, there won't be any damage to the wound.|`|yb01tlviaa	male rats normally dont fight.  mightypower7 doesnt know what shes talking about as she worked with them in a LAB, who knows what they were doing to them...

Then heir are the other like Oscars that grow very large ( about the size of a large dinner plate and most get larger) The red belly pacu's are normally pretty small when we get them but they can grow over 2 feet long and require a 55 gallon tank for one. Same with the goldfish. People buy them and can put them in 10 gallon tanks to begin with they need 55 gallons depending on the size. <br>  <br>  If you think everyone at Petsmart are losers then don't buy things there.|`|mnsuJ1MXaa	Sounds ok for a ten gallon|`|svrFBaENaa	Looks ok to me... it won't be overstocked.. well in the normal sense of the word anyway.<br>  <br>  5 Male Guppies may not get along with each other depending on their individual temperaments. There may be some fin nipping. You may have to relocate any problem guppies if it does occur.<br>  <br>  I would also consider a different filter. Sponge filters are great for establishing the biofilter, but without activated carbon, there's no real mechanical filtration going on. Have you considered a hang on the back filter? They're not as cheap as a sponge filter, but aren't that much more either.|`|h6bJ8RVoaa	umm well it sounds okay to me... those are all small guys so they'll be fine...<br>  <br>  2 live plants... may i ask what type it is? as long as it's hardy and have powerful roots then its fine, because corydoras like to dig for food (but don't worry,they're not destructive )<br>  <br>  5 male guppies huh?? is it okay if i suggest to you platy? they're smaller than guppies and both sex is pretty... plus you can sell the fries if you want :)|`|D4ot0qLpaa	Despite your "eww", the Petsmart person is correct: guppies often grow to double the size at which you purchased them, maxxing out at nearly 2 inches for the males. And corys, depending on species, are usually only about an inch long when sold in pet stores, but can grow to 2-1/2 inches or more. The vast majority of fish that you get will at least double or triple their size after you bring them home.<br>  <br>  It's good that you included information about your tank setup - most folks don't bother to do that. :) Estimates like the one you're quoting can be useful, but they are oversimplified. The bioload that a tank can support depends not only on the size of the tank, but also on the filtration level. If you have a good combination mechanical/biological filter running at 75-100 gph, you can probably get away with that 16" of slim-bodied fish, or possibly even more if you do very frequent partial water changes. But if you're using a sponge filter running off of an air pump, or a small (25-50 gph) power filter without a biological component, I'd stick closer to 8-10" of fish. That's why I'd have to agree that your proposed bioload is high. You would do better to either reduce it or add more filtration.<br>  <br>  Also, you know that you need to stock the tank gradually, right? Adding that load all at once can cause a huge ammonia crash; you'd end up losing fish or having to treat for fin rot, most likely. Add just a couple of fish at a time, with at least a week or two in between.<br>  <br>  With regard to "only losers work at petsmart", you should realize that pet stores, just like any other store, hire whomever they can get. Sometimes they are full of ignorant people; sometimes you find real experts there. Don't write someone off just because of where they work. Especially not someone who is just trying to help you answer a question that's important to you.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!
2t4PRzEQaa	I think it'd be just a little bit crowded... two for a 20 gallon is alright, unless you get one of those tank toppers, that would be cool for three. I would NOT recommend buying from petsmart though... you should rescue some gerbils from the shelters. Try using petfinder.|`|dvJYp7YAaa	Well, I like both. I've never had problems with either males or females. I think putting 3 gerbils in a 20 gallon would be alright as long as there are lots of toys and things for them to play on.<br>  <br>  Cardboard toys work the best. Toilet paper rolls and things like that. If you want a hammock, you could try cutting up an old towel or something.

They are quite large, as rats go, about 3 lbs or more, big enough they are almost the size of a small cat, and I've seen some as big as cats.  They are very sweet, and clean.  They come in paint-style coats as well as solid colors.  Look at the exotic pet stores in your area or online and see if you can find a pic.  I know Animal Planet did a spot on them once, but it was a while ago.  I've looked online and can't currently find any pics.

But keep it small and limit too much could cause an upset stomach. <br>  <br>  Its also ok to give them raw fruits and veggies like carrots, banana's, apples and sweet potatoes. <br>  <br>  But do NOT give your pup any grapes, raisins, onions, garlic, chocolate, or fruits with pits (so avocados, peaches, plum) All of these have been known to be highly toxic to dogs.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	Chicken,cheese,turkey hot dogs,carrots,beef chunks,chicken livers.You don't want to feed her too much human food or she will expect to eat it all the time.Make sure she eats her puppy food and just give her a few bites of chicken breast or a chicken liver as a treat.But there are tons of great dog treats out there.Rawhide is bad,though,as a dog can choke on it or get an intestinal obstruction.You can make you own jerky by slicing chicken,beef or lamb into thin slices,placing on a greased cookie sheet and baking at 180 degrees F for at least 8 hours or until the meat is dry like jerky.|`|AA10473274	Any kind of meat and some cheese (small pieces).

When I want to give my dog a "human food" treat, I'll give him some peanut butter in one of his Kong toys, or sometimes I'll boil up some chicken or beef for him mixed into his food. Sometimes I'll add a little cooked brown rice with some chicken or beef stock too. He has kinda yucky skin, too, so he gets salmon a few times a week for his skin, so I don't give him "treat" foods too often. Try not to give her too much processed stuff, like burgers from fast food places, or stuff like that, because it's not only bad for dogs, it's not too good for us, either!!! There's also A LOT of new dog treats that are made form human grade ingredients that have no preservatives or by-products, that my dog loves too! I left a few sites below where they have some great stuff! Good luck!|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	you can give tiny pieces of boiled chicken, or slice turkey hot dogs paper thin, bake them til crisp, and refrigerate them.<br>  <br>  sometimes i cut up a log of Natural Balance dog food into small pieces and keep that in fridge or freezer for treats, too<br>  <br>  there are a lot of dog treat recipes on line.  you might do a search if that is something which interests you.|`|AA12084593	STEAK|`|xPDSkSyjaa	If you are just looking for the occasional treat to supplement a well-balanced proper dog food, then I would use raw baby carrots or steamed green beans.  Dogs also love bananas and apples.  Be careful what you feed your dog that is human food as many of our foods can be toxic to dogs (onions, grapes just to name a few).  Educate yourself about feeding too much human food...  go to DogAware.com or a similar sight.<br>  <br>  My dogs LOVE to get veggies and fruit from me - its our special time to share and I replaced regular dog treats with steamed green beans for our overweight dog and successfully got his weight down to the perfect range.  I buy the 4 pound bag of french green beans at the Costco and steam them at once.  Serve them one night to my family and keep the leftovers in a ziploc bag and use them daily as treats.  Needless to say, the dogs have learned to surf the Costco box and see if they find the beans.  Good luck with your new friend.

Trust me ive had experience. All the cats ive had in my life (over 10) got sick or got diarrea on my carpet whenever we gave them dairy products. thats because they're lactose intolerant.

It can kill them. <br>  <br>  Maybe get him some can food and take it out of the can, put it on a speical plate, and then shape it so it looks like a cake? If you really wanted to.

Ao contrário, cachorros agressivos e dominantes abanam seus rabos em movimentos curtos e rápidos, quase parados e totalmente eretos.<br>  <br>  Quando um cachorro abana o rabo pela volta de seu dono ao lar, novamente ele demonstra um conflito entre a alegria e excitamento em rever o dono e uma pontinha de apreens?o já que eles nos vêm como os líderes do grupo, do qual a sobrevivência deles depende.<br>  <br>  Outro aspecto no fato dos cachorros abanarem o rabo é a mensagem olfativa que eles est?o enviando.

IJr0MR1Aaa	Its spelled Groenendael.  Walk him/her every day.  How long will depend on how old he is and how energetic he is.  If he is a puppy under 4 months of age, walk until he shows signs of slowing down.  If between 6 months and 8 months, besides simply walking, run and or find some activity that will burn off energy, such as retrieve.  If he is an adolescent or adult still in his prime, he will benefit from a good run at least once a week.<br>  <br>  Even more important than physical exercise for an intelligent breed that was bred to work with people, is mental exercise.  Enroll in obedience classes and once he is off leash trained you might look for an agility club.  Groenendaels love it and usually so do their owners.  This will give the dog exercise and some mental stimulation, as well as providing you a fun way to get to know other dog lovers.|`|y0cbLn0Yaa	It is spelt Groenendael.  These are a very active breed needing both alot of physical and mental stimulation, especially for the first 3 years or so.<br>  <br>  You would need to walk the dog twice a day for an hour each time.  In addition it would be great if you had access to a safe area where the dog could be allowed off lead to really run and blow off steam.  It is critical that this breed be well socialised while young and I would strongly suggest enrolling in obedience classes.  This is a breed which will really excel at Obedience.  Once the dog is controllable off lead then Agility classes are another good idea for the breed.  If you have access to herding training, I would definitely look into it.<br>  <br>  The Belgian Shepherd can be the most amazing and wonderful family pet if raised well, but an absolute nightmare if not.  I have had experience in the breed for over 20 years, Groenendaels and now the Malinois.|`|UETAqR8Taa	I think you mean how many times a day not week. really. x2 30 minutes per day. Highly active " I want exercise dog"<br>  <br>  please excuse any sarcasm sounding - not intended|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	Your dog needs a lot of exercise.  If you have a local dog park, beach, fields or trails with boundaries, it is a good idea to let him run.... dogs need to run around like kids... <br>  <br>  I take my dog for a run at least 4 times a week for an hour or so.  We play fetch and she explores.  She is to the point now where i can take her places safely, without boundaries.<br>  <br>  But to be safe, he needs an enclosed area for a while.|`|taLD45Sqaa	As much as you can! If I can't walk my pups I make sure to spend at least a little time letting them run and chase the ball or I chase them around the yard and we play. Dogs will walk as much as you are willing to walk them, they love it.|`|AM7CgQ4daa	I would assume they are similar to the GSD, so must be walked every day.   I find it best to walk morning and afternoon, I do approx 40 minutes each time.|`|UdICTUnaaa	these are working active dogs, they need to be walked for at least an hour every day! not walking a dog can cause mental and behavioral problems<br>  dont you ever watch the dog whisperer?|`|XuK91PwKaa	I think dogs should be walked at least once a day regardless of size. I just think how would YOU like it, if you only got to go out once a week. Dogs are natural outdoor animals, and they need to get some fresh air and exercise.|`|322582d735a927f0dbcd0ead5902a454aa	at least twice a day morning and night if you can walk it more often and for as long as it  takes  for the dog to go to the bathroom a few times great excercise for both of you
8i90ov0Gaa	I use racks for my ball pythons and they are heated with Flexwatt heat tape connected to thermostats. As for humidity, all I use is newspaper for a substrate and a water dish. Bins hold heat and humidity much better than a glass aquarium with a screen lid. Heat and humidity rise and a screen lid allows most of it to escape. But since the bins just have some holes on the sides, it holds most of the heat and humidity, and for me, a water dish is more than enough without me having to buy fancy substrates to allow proper humidity levels.|`|TkJn9gO0aa	Keeping snakes without a heat source is irresponsible and i can assure you any breeder that does so, isn't a good breeder.<br>  <br>  Giving snakes access to only 84.545334543340943 F is a recipe for disaster. For racks, the only option really available is heat tape like Flex-Watte. <br>  <br>  For some locations, the local humidity is high enough to not worry about it. Other more arid places may utilize a humidity machine in the snake room or with some other climate control system. Tubs with lids are great at keeping in humidty, but most rack systems don't utilize actual lids.
2t4PRzEQaa	Lol nooo, all hamsters take out their poop and throw it actually, it's completely normal (:|`|ak9DrBSwaa	If your hamster is always trying to escape its cage, chances are the cage is too small. Look into a 105 qt bin cage, 20 gallon long aquarium or something else of equivelant or larger floor space.<br>  <br>  Hamster eating their feces is normal, many rodents do this to get certain vitamins.<br>  <br>  Since you have a Syrian hamster, you can not keep its sister in the same cage. You would need two seperate cages to keep two Syrians. They must live alone.|`|lhIucz23aa	My teddy bear hamster does this 2, its atchully pretty digusting but cute at the same time, just go with it and make sure to give a wet down weekly like pat it down with a cloth and make sure they always have food and water|`|TUFoB5RMaa	Its all normal.. most hamsters do that so don't worry!!  Also, you might see your hamster eating her own droppings. This is quite normal as they provide the hamster the bacteria needed to create Vitamin B12 during digestion.|`|dvJYp7YAaa	Hahahahahahaha!!!<br>   Your hammy has a personality!!!!<br>  <br>  This is actually normal ... in monkeys.... <br>  <br>  hahahaha.<br>  <br>  This is cute! Enjoy it!
pwiRMmicaa	they're awesome family dogs. i have one and there's 4 kids and 2 adults in are home. they love with all their might and protcect you and your home aswell and they want to learn new things too.my doberman is really gentle and thinks he's a baby and sits on are laps when we sit down and he's very gentle with puppies and babies when they come aound ,but he drools all over them lol.<br>  but you have to watch out they're big dogs and heavy so they might knock down younger babies on accident.|`|iJtuhLMTaa	Dobermans can be excellent family pets for the right family IF they are properly bred, trained and socialized.   They are not the dog for everyone by any means.  Dobermans aren't generally recommend for first time owners but if you do your research properly and are willing to actually do the work it takes the train the dog properly you should be fine if a Dobie otherwise fits into your family.     It is important to get a Doberman from a responsible breeder (even more so if it will be around small children)  far to many BYB are breeding Dobies with improper temperaments.|`|sUXyRlVjaa	<a href="http://www.dpca.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dpca.org/</a> This is the US national breed club's website and any research should start here.  But, in general Dobies are not recommended for first time or inexperienced owners.  Below is a pretty good assessment of the pros and cons for the breed.<br>  <br>  If you want a dog who... <br>  <br>  Is large and strong, yet sleek- and elegant-looking <br>  Has a short easy-care coat <br>  Thrives on exercise, athletic activities, and challenging things to do <br>  Looks serious and imposing, so makes an effective deterrent even when friendly <br>  A Doberman Pinscher may be right for you.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you don't want to deal with... <br>  <br>  An extra careful search to avoid dangerous lines <br>  Providing enough exercise to keep him satisfied <br>  Rowdiness and exuberant jumping, especially when young <br>  Aggression, sharpness, suspiciousness, or shyness when not socialized enough <br>  Aggression toward other animals <br>  Emotional sensitivity to stress and loud voices <br>  Physical sensitivity (tendency to react defensively when startled or mishandled) <br>  Shedding <br>  A multitude of serious health problems <br>  Legal liabilities (public perception, future breed bans, insurance problems, increased chance of lawsuits) <br>  A Dobermann Pinscher may not be right for you.<br>  <br>  My major concerns would be:<br>  <br>  Unstable temperaments. Doberman Pinschers are a dime a dozen, and most of them are bred and offered for sale by people who don't have the slightest idea of how to breed good-tempered dogs. Obedience instructors and behavioral consultants see LOTS of Doberman Pinschers with neurotic behaviors, including aggression and biting, extreme fearfulness, and hyperactivity.<br>  <br>  Providing enough exercise and mental stimulation. Doberman Pinschers MUST have regular opportunities to vent their energy and do interesting things. Otherwise they will become rambunctious and bored -- which they usually express by barking and destructive chewing. Bored Doberman Pinschers can make a shambles of your house and yard.<br>  <br>  If you simply want a pet for your family, and don't have the time or inclination to take your dog running or hiking or biking or swimming, or to get involved in agility (obstacle course), or advanced obedience, or tracking, or schutzhund (protection), or a similar canine activity, I do not recommend this breed. <br>  <br>  Providing enough socialization. Many Dobermann Pinschers have protective instincts toward strangers. They need extensive exposure to friendly people so they learn to recognize the normal behaviors of "good guys." Then they can recognize the difference when someone acts abnormally. Without careful socialization, they may be suspicious of everyone, which could lead to biting. Some Dobermans go in the opposite direction -- without enough socialization, they become fearful of strangers, which can lead to defensive biting.<br>  <br>  Animal aggression. Some Doberman Pinschers are dominant or aggressive toward other dogs of the same sex. Many have strong instincts to chase and seize cats and other fleeing creatures. If anything goes wrong in the breeding, socializing, training, handling, or management of this breed, it is capable of seriously injuring or killing other animals.<br>  <br>  Emotional sensitivity. Be honest...is there tension in your home? Are people loud or angry or emotional? Are there arguments or fights? Doberman Pinschers are extremely sensitive to stress and can end up literally sick to their stomachs, with digestive upsets and nervous behaviors, if the people in their home are having family problems.<br>  <br>  If you have small children, I do not recommend a Doberman Pinscher. First, young Dobermanns (up to about two years old) romp and jump with great vigor, and things can go flying, including people. Second, Doberman Pinschers may try to protect their own children from other children, which could lead to tragedy if kids are simply roughhousing and your Doberman decides to stop it. Finally, there are just too many Dobermans who feel overwhelmed by the loud voices and quick movements that children can't help making -- and stress and shyness (even defensive biting) may be the result. <br>  <br>  <br>  Shedding. Doberman Pinschers shed more than you might think. Their short coarse hairs come off on your hands when you pet them, and stick tenaciously to your carpeting, upholstery, and clothing.<br>  <br>  Extremely high prices. Some breeders are charging over $1500 for a Doberman puppy. In my opinion, this is absolutely absurd and I wouldn't even consider supporting prices like this.<br>  <br>  Serious health problems. In the health department, Doberman Pinschers are extremely risky. An alarming number of Dobermans die of heart disease and cancer at an early age.<br>  <br>  <br>  Legal liabilities. Doberman Pinschers may be targeted for "banning" in certain areas, or refusal of homeowner insurance policies. Your friends and neighbors may be uncomfortable around this breed. In this day and age, the legal liabilities of owning any breed that looks intimidating and has a history as a guard dog should be seriously considered.
XagPxe7Faa	There is no such thing as a "teacup" Yorkie.  "Teacup" is a marketing term used by unethical breeders to describe dogs bred to be extremely small with no regard to health.  So in a word, NO, they are not good.  These are the types of breeders that should be avoided at all costs.<br>  Reputable breeders who produce "good" dogs focus on the health and temperament of the dog as well as breeding dogs that conform to the breed standard.|`|Xtqs0Hxzaa	This is like the 10 billionth question about 'teacup' yorkies...<br>  *sigh*<br>  no, they are not good dogs. they are the products of irresponsible, cruel back-yard-breeders or puppy mills. If you want a dog, adopt from a shelter; save a life. or go to a reputable, responsible breeder.|`|dWed21jUaa	No such thing.<br>  <br>  Teacup is another word for poorly breed, sick dogs. <br>  <br>  <br>  Yorkies are good dogs. But don't get a teacup. You'll be supporting teh suffering of dogs if you do.|`|nFcl0BOsaa	Good and overpriced. Good for high vet bills and behavioral problems.|`|zWFJBlJZaa	A Yorkie is a VERY good dog -- it has a big dog's brain in a small dog's body.<br>  <br>  There is no such thing as a teacup yorkie.  If you are going to someone who is trying to sell you a teacup yorkie I have the perfect response -- "I want a written warranty that this puppy will weigh no more than 5 pounds as an adult."  If they sign one for you then ask them how soon they are leaving the country!!! (LOL)<br>  <br>  Please go to: <a href="http://www.AKC.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.AKC.org</a> - Breeds or Breed Clubs and find a Yorkie Breeder in your area to talk to.  A Pet Quality could run as little as $500.00 and a Show Quality could well be over $1,000.00.  But either way, the people listed on AKC.org are legitimate breeders and you should end up with a happy, healthy little friend.|`|YuTFG3feaa	Teacups are hard to come by and you will be looking at some high vet bills if you do get one.  I have a Yorkie weighing in at 4-1/2lbs and I think he is a perfect size.  I have had 2 prior to him approximately in the same weight range.  Teacups and miniatures usually run on average $1500.  lol|`|PM23RDycaa	High vet bills putting way too munch money in the hands of bybs and puppymills and breaking your heart when they are dead before the age of five. Ever wonder why paris hilton is rarely seen with the same dog more than a few times?<br>  <br>  If you want a yorkie go adopt one or go to a REPUTABLE breeder who breeds just yorkies, which are to be no larger than 7lbs.<br>  <br>  There is no such thing as a teacup dog.|`|AM7CgQ4daa	What people are trying to say, that the word teacup means the pup is too small for the breed, some people use the word runt.<br>  They tend to have more physical problems and are much more delicate.  So unless you have money to spend at the vet, and a very quiet house with no other dogs or children that may hurt the pup,   get a well bred one instead - not a teacup
AA11887983	Depends on the condition that you are treating, and the weight of the cat.  Different antibiotics treat against different types of bacteria, and different conditions are caused by different types of bacteria.  Dosing is usually based on the weight of the cat, but that depends on the condition.  Dosing can be varied, depending on what you are treating for.  <br>  <br>  Most antibiotics are pretty safe, unless your cat has a reaction to it.  No way to know if that is going to happen unless you give it to them.<br>  <br>  And if it is not helping, please get a second opinion.  You are the only one who can speak for your cat.  <br>  <br>  And Einstein, you just proved that people will give erroneous information on here just to give an answer.  What is the concentration of the amoxicillin that you recommend, and what size cat is that dose for? And what are you specifically treating with amoxicillin?|`|FCY3lwnoaa	There is *no* safe antibiotic for a cat to take unless it is prescribed by a Vet.<br>  <br>  Specific antibiotics need to be given for specific infections.  There isn't one antibiotic for all infections.<br>  <br>  If you are having trouble paying for a trip to the vet, go to a Vet Hospital.  They are much more flexible in accepting payments  over time for treatment.<br>  <br>  Added:  Just read your new info.  If your cat is not getting any better, I strongly suggest that you get a second opinion.|`|Ow2xyl9iaa	GO GET AN OTHER VET.. you should only give you cat antibiotics from the vet they  they have a liquid at the vets....but i would tahe him to anoher vet,, this one maybe giving the wrong medicine for a wrong diagnosis and i don, think he should be on steroids have not heard of any cats on it..........so just why is he  and what has he diagnoiis his illness to be....please try another vet   GOD BLESS and i pray that all will work out well and you will find out what his real problem is   i send prayers your way|`|ug1OrLMlaa	Amoxicillian.  Usually 1/2 tsp. per 5lbs. of body weight.|`|AA11457471	The one your vet prescribes!<br>  <br>  Add:<br>  It's time to get another opinion & a definite diagnosis. <br>  Steroids should be used as a last resort- not as a quick fix!<br>  <br>  Einstein is no genius!!! <br>  Dosages are always given in milligrams!

taLD45Sqaa	Maybe she ate too much too quickly? Try soaking her dry food in water so it expands BEFORE she eats it and not in her stomach..... puppies can be quite sensitive. She may need a diet without fillers in her food if this doesn't help. Mention it to the vet when you go for shots eventually.|`|38ab6659a0292a00b09330a5fca5c2deaa	Puppies do throw up quite a bit at first.  Try 5 very small meals during the day so her stomach can learn to cope with the new food.  If she is still acting healthy and happy you can wait until you see the vet.  If she starts acting listless and sick take her right in.|`|Qr7cTlFaaa	she may have parvo virus|`|QKn1oUnEaa	My family trains puppies and dogs for a living and it is not normal for your puppy to be throwing up like that.  I would be concerned about parasites, parvo, etc since your pup has not been vaccinated yet.  BTW First shots should be given at six weeks when they come off it's mother's milk.  I hope your puppy is doing alright by morning but either way I would take the little dear to the vet.  If you can't afford to have it's shots done by a vet you can order them and give them yourself, with the exception of rabies shots.  Good Luck and give your pup a pet for me!|`|yL94qX5baa	Your puppy might just have food allergies, which will not be a big deal. <br>  <br>  But the vomiting may also be from something far different and can lead to renal failure if left untreated.  The good news is that she is still drinking water.  Parvo is the main cause of vomitting in small puppies and can be fatal.  <br>  <br>  I would remain calm and call the nearest emergency vet tonight, if you don't have one nearby look up the closest city and call them for advice.  If this fails try to get some pedalite (the kind for children) and give it to her some her electrolytes stay up until the morning when you can get her to a vet.<br>  <br>  I hope everything turns out well.|`|im4SbMP2aa	i agree with shannon and u need not bother bout her vaccination as this is not the problem.actually u have been giving him dry food and when ur pet drinks water the food soaks the water and take the passage of mouth becous it wsnt digested and he ate his stomach full when you gave him his hills science diet food.|`|RDZGo6kQaa	I would suggest going to a vet.<br>  <br>  Or at least ringing one so they can help you over the phone, to see if a consult is nessecary.|`|jYddkshRaa	If its clear its because she is not drinking enough.<br>  If you gave her any kind of milk it might be it because human milk gives puppies deadly direihea. if she has went outside with out her shots it might be parvo.|`|AA11887983	If she is vomiting tomorrow, please call your vet.  It is never normal for puppies to be vomiting, and if they are doing it frequently, there is something not right.

AA11887983	I think it is just because pork is usually so much more fatty than beef or chicken.  In small amounts, it usually isn't a problem, but you'll notice that there are not any pet foods that have pork as the primary protein source.  It really can cause gi upset, as well as pancreatitis, but mostly in dogs.  Cats seem to tolerate it better, but only in small amounts, and some not at all.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	pork used to be a source of trichinosis, a type of roundworm.  usually pigs which are not wormed or have been fed trash  can carry the worms, but these days i don't think it's common at all.<br>  <br>  if you are giving an animal a bit of pork, make sure it's well cooked.  but that also goes for us, too|`|kZrZCPRMaa	My cats at age 5months i give her ham for her daily snack each day and she also gets twice a month vet visits or more and she couldnt be more healthy!?(:|`|38ab6659a0292a00b09330a5fca5c2deaa	The old wives tale is because you should not feed them uncooked pork because of worm eggs in raw pork.|`|quPY9x7qaa	old wives tale.... my cat loves bacon and sausage when i let her have it, and she's healthy as a horse @ 8 yrs old|`|AA11457471	When it comes to pork, if it's healthy for you, it's healthy for your pet.<br>  Raw pork (as opposed to some other meats) is not a good idea.<br>  Bacon, sausage & ham should be avoided but pork roast, broiled pork chops, etc. are a great addition to your cat's diet!

a4bee146fb1af35a63c4c879832ea8bcaa	Whoa there... hold off on medicating your pet before you know what's wrong!<br>  <br>  Things that hairloss can indicate:<br>  Dermatitis due to skin infection<br>  Flea bite allergy (but not usually so if you don't see any fleas)<br>  Hyperthyroidism<br>  Ringworm<br>  Allergies<br>  Barbering (behavior when a cat chews for no reason)<br>  +/- kidney disease<br>  Stress<br>  <br>  I would call your clinic and leave a message for the doctor that saw your cat. Often times they look at the record and can give you advice over the phone. If the cat had hairloss at the vet, the vet should note it in the chart during the exam. But I wouldn't treat for something you don't know she has without asking the vet... often that can cover up a problem or cause a bigger problem.|`|876c49193a9313c4e97d08ad1f9cc5e9aa	I had a cat that lost patches of hair on her rump if she came into contact with fleas... I don't know if that could be it or not--maybe you could just give the vet's office a call and tell them you forgot to ask at your appointment, but you wondered if they had noticed anything problematic?|`|AA12390593	I am aware that hair loss in cats if it is generalized is typically because the cat is stressed.  When the hair loss is in a specific area my sense is that it is probably something she is doing via chewing and is probably the result of a food allergy or she may have bites from fleas which can cause extreme itching.  Do you notice any inflammation, reddening of the skin in that area, bumps?  Have you changed her food recently?  While you shouldn't be overly concerned, it should be watched so you will know if it gets better or worse.  If it does not clear up within a week or 10 days, I recommend you take her in or some vets will talk to you on the phone and give you an idea of what it might be and/or what you might do about it.  Since she has had a check up recently, they probably won't charge you for another check-up, just the office visit.  Good luck and remember, you are the only one she has to rely on to provide her what she needs to be safe and healthy.  I know $ can be a problem but you wouldn't want her to be suffering either.  You may be able to work something out with the vet too.|`|a7e780077bc89240ec94b74a49f6392aaa	That is a classic dermatitis area, back of legs and hips. Keep her Frontlined or Advantaged for flea control and see if it clears up. If not, she may need a steroid from the vet, to control itching.|`|1203d31ab3bc3d0447a306d55a7bde5faa	It is possible that your cat has had an allergic reaction to flea bites.  You can get a flea comb from most pet stores (it's a very fine-toothed metal comb); run it through the cat's fur, and if there are fleas, they will be caught between the teeth of the comb.  If you see fleas, you will of course need to deal with those.  If you don't see fleas, and the bald patches don't spread, then keep an eye on them to be sure that they are not getting infected; if the area starts to spread significantly, it's time to see the vet.  Since it sounds like you've recently taken the cat for a check-up, the fact that the vet didn't mention it makes me think that it is a temporary matter; if you can see that it is distressing the cat, then take her/him in to be seen again.  Good luck!|`|e8a2336066b398f2a0cee83079550024aa	There may be something of use here.

(if recent and just change food i would consider  this)<br>  3) If you bathe your dog to much it dry's and irrtates the skin or if you dont bathe your dog at all this could cause fungus to grow on the skin too. ( Once a week to at least once every 6 weeks bathe your dog. shampoo is important and only use approved dog safe shampoos)<br>  4) The sun can also cause this so make sure if outside it has plenty of shade.<br>  5) Also be sure to brush its hair if long.

Even adults can die from sand so the baby for the baby its really dangerous. Only if a gecko is 6" long can it be put on sand but its still really dangerous. <br>  <br>  It should be eating alot. 7 to 10 crickets or more.

dvJYp7YAaa	Food:<br>  Use lab blocks or make your own mix. The seed has too much protein and fat for the little ratties. Some eat until they get sick. <br>  Treats:<br>  Yogurt drops are the best, and actually the only rat treat you should give them since fat&protein are so high in the other ones.  You can give them dog food/bones as well if they are low fat.<br>  Human Food/Treats:<br>  Small amounts!!!!! Veggies, fruit (Anything BUT: oranges&rinds, banana rinds, cabbage, spinach lettuce). Cooked meat (not hamburger though), cheese, crackers, bread, boiled egg.<br>  <br>  Bedding:<br>  Carefresh (Not pine or cedar -- upper respiratory diseases start this way), aspen is alright, but mix it with something else, newspaper, fleece (on the bottom and just throw it in with the laundry every week!), shredded paper. No plastic or anything not bio-degradable.<br>  <br>  Cage:<br>  Make sure the bars are coated!! If not, your ratties might chew on the bars and get lead poisoning. Make sure it's big enough (you said you knew this already)<br>  <br>  Toys:<br>  Home-made for cheaper:<br>  Cardboard anything! Toilet paper rolls, paper towel rolls, anything they can chew on.<br>  Hammock: Cut up an old towel and use zip-ties for tying it to the cage (Or just use rope or a shoelace for ez to get down to wash kind of stuff). You can use old socks too.<br>  House:<br>  Kleenex box! That's what I use for my standard size rats. I thought only one could fit in there, but you can fit a few!! 3 will snuggle up and sleep at night in mine. <br>  Chew toys:<br>  Nylabones, rawhide (not too many -- this is hard on their digestive system!) Anything wood, basically.<br>  <br>  Things you have to buy (or that I think is necessary)<br>  Wheel -- some don't use it, but most of my females do. Some of my males use it. I got the plastic one (Large size).<br>  Water bottle - I use the glass one because it doesn't smell as bad as the plastic ones, and they can't chew through it. Better quality as well.<br>  Food dish - Cheap too. You obviously need this<br>  Chews - Anything that is soft enough plastic (like nylabones) or wood. I just use the mineral chews. <br>  Toys! Rats are smart and need something to do while you are away. BOREDOM SIGNS: They will start chewing on the  bars and get overexicted when you come back and might bite you too hard.<br>  <br>  You use your imagination with toys. I use bird/cat/dog toys in my cage. <br>  <br>  I have a mirror which they use quite frequently, and a bird ladder that I taught them how to climb. Cat toys are the ones with the bell. They like that one too.<br>  I also have that one wood block toy that they have to chew up to get the nut inside. They are almost there! Lasts for a long time!<br>  <br>  <br>  Things to be aware of:<br>  Respiratory diseases/infections: symptoms: poryphin (looks like blood) coming out of ears, nose, eyes, mouth. Sneezing or coughing. Weezing -- NEEDS MEDICAL ATTENTION This happens when they are allergic to bedding, or allergic to something in the room -- no candles, sprays, scented anything, and be careful about bedding.<br>  Fight wounds - cuts, basically. Not to worry unless it won't stop bleeding or it looks serious. Don't worry about a 'rat fight' if there's no blood. They are either playing rough, power grooming, or fighting for dominance. Let them.<br>  Bumblefoot - calouses on feet, limping, not wanting to move. NEEDS MEDICAL ATTENTION. This happens when they are on an un-even surface for too long. i.e. wired cage floors. Use carpet or rubber or something to keep this from happening. I use fleece on the top levels of the cage.<br>  Head tilt -- NEEDS MEDICAL ATTENTION -- MOST LIKELY WON'T MAKE IT. This is the worst thing that could happen to a rat. They are in pain, confused, dilerious, and basically paralyzed. Head injury/trauma, genetic trait, or something else. This cannot be seen ahead of time if young. Sometimes it just develops -- it's basically a brain tumor. If this happens, you will most likely lose your ratty. :( Hopefully you will never have to go through this. I have--twice.<br>  <br>  Good lcuk and I would be happy to answer any more questions you may have about rats!|`|dbd38c52ccf7ad225191e12b53727a75aa	Dapper is a good place too.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dapper.com.au/articles.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dapper.com.au/articles.htm</a>|`|uBFhKXgHaa	Instead of trying to tell you everything you need to know about rat care, I will refer you to some good websites for research:<br>  <a href="http://www.petinfopackets.com/rats/ratinfopacket.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.petinfopackets.com/rats/ratin...</a> (My website)<br>  <a href="http://www.rmca.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rmca.org/</a><br>  <a href="ftp://members.aol.com/juliesrats/e4nindex.html" rel="nofollow">ftp://members.aol.com/juliesrats/e4ninde...</a><br>  <a href="http://ratguide.com/" rel="nofollow">http://ratguide.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.goosemoose.com/rfc/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.goosemoose.com/rfc/index.php</a><br>  <br>  Darksong~|`|BWez86Ldaa	Cages:<br>  The one and only thing to remember about cages is that rats' urine has a lot of ammonia in it, and because of this you *must* have an open-air cage if you want to keep your rats healthy. The cages I suggest are Martin's cage ((<a href="http://www.martinscages.com))" rel="nofollow">http://www.martinscages.com))</a> or the Ferret Nation or Critter Nation by Midwest ((<a href="http://www.midwesthomesforpets.com/))." rel="nofollow">http://www.midwesthomesforpets.com/)).</a> All three of these cages are completely awesome for rats and will allow your babies plenty of room for play and furniture!!\<br>  <br>  Food<br>  This is, probably, the biggest debate in the rat world! The one basic thing to remember is that you must do your research! Personally, I serve a mix called SueBee's mix. <br>  <br>  A: SueBee's Mix: is a combonation of cereals, dried fruits, nuts, and so on that you mix together yourself with ingredients you can buy from any common grocery store. Here is the website for more information: ((<a href="http://www.ratsrule.com/diet.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ratsrule.com/diet.html</a> )) Suebee's mix is meant to be served with an equal portion of premium dog food along with fresh fruits and veggies.<br>  <br>  There is also the Molasses diet, which is simular to SueBee's diet only in that you mix it yourself and you can buy all the ingredients from your local grocery store. Here is the website for more information: ((<a href="http://www.ratfanclub.org/diet.html))." rel="nofollow">http://www.ratfanclub.org/diet.html)).</a><br>  <br>  5. Cage Fillers and Accessories:<br>  <br>  A. Bedding:<br>  Personally, I do not use any kind of "bedding" I use only fabrics, mostly fleece because rats tend to get their little nails stuck in other fabrics. I enjoy using fleece and fabrics for "bedding" because it's easy to clean and completely reusable. If you want something for your kids to dig in, CareFresh is the most suggested bedding I can possibly think of. I used it when I had mice and I just loved it, however, it's not easy to clean, and because of it's fluffy nature, it tends to get "all over the place". <br>  <br>  B. Accessories<br>  Almost anything can go in a rat's cage. Hammocks, ropes, ferret toys, bird toys, puppy toys, boxes, igloos, and so on. The more "stuff" the better, and the more fun your little ones will have ruffling around the "junk". Try ((<a href="http://www.Ferret.com))" rel="nofollow">http://www.Ferret.com))</a> for some good ideas!
ld2vmypNaa	Aquatic Turtles are a life long commitment.<br>  <br>  ‘Austinsturtlepage.com’ has all info on care and feeding for all land and aquatic turtles.<br>  <br>  Swollen eyes due to lack of vitamin A fruits and veggies. So he can't see the food if his eyes are bad.<br>  Petco sells eye drops for this. But you must feed veggies and fruits as well as feeder guppies goldfish or minnows.<br>  They NEED calcium and protein they get it from the fish meat and the fish bones. Drop 20 or 30 or so feeder guppies or small goldfish or minnows they maybe a bit fast for babies at first just drop in the tank and watch them disappear in a few days! <br>  They can have garden worms which are a great source of protein. which I collect after a good rain and dump them in the pond, also meal worms, snails, crickets, flies, crayfish small frogs, slugs, tadpoles, ghost shrimp , dragon flies and anything that moves, but only as a treat.<br>  They need leafy greens Romaine, Butter lettuce. (Iceberg and cabbage are bad for them, any other leafy greens will do) for vitamin A that they need at least 4 to 5 times a week.<br>  They love grapes and strawberries and squash , apples cut up<br>  TOSS in a bird cuttle bone in the water for calcium that will promote better shell growth, it will dissolve real slow and if they eat it that’s fine!!<br>  <br>  Did you know that they need to bask under a reptile light UVA/UVB for up to 8 hrs a day for the Vitamin D that they need to grow<br>  <br>  Contact rescues sites…and vets ..in your city ,state, or country<br>  For land or aquatic turtles:<br>   <a href="http://www.anapsid.org/reslider.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.anapsid.org/reslider.html</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/29035692@N03/sets/72157614552292977/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/29035692@N0...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  I wish you luck.|`|2YIxnXXyaa	Honestly, I would just take it to the vet.<br>  With it not eating, puffy swollen eyes and a bleeding shell...it's worth the drive...because if you don't do it now, later on could be too late.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/</a><br>  <br>  There's a LOT of information out red eared sliders.<br>  Sicknesses, symptoms, and there's even a page that has listings of vets who treat turtles in each state.<br>  Be sure not to go to one that doesn't treat turtles because they won't know how to treat them most likely.<br>  <br>  Mine have never done this so I honestly don't know and I'm not going to try to tell you what to do because..well just because that's wrong if I don't know the answers.<br>  But seriously, I suggest taking it to the vet as soon as possible.|`|ybf1g89jaa	Forget the mealworms and buy red worms.  The red worms will wiggle and not drown as quickly.  RES love to eat red worms and they are full of protien....If your turt doesn't start responding soon you really should take him/her to the vet.|`|sBn7D0h4aa	I would say that the swollen eyes could possibly be the beginning stages of either a respiratory infection or a vitamin A deficiency.<br>  <br>  If he has a respiratory infection (bubbles coming from the nose, wheezing/hissing noises when breathing, listlessness, not eating) raise his water temperature to 85-88 degrees as this will help them fight infection/illness. If he has a vitamin A deficiancy introduce things like carrots, kale, mustard greens, romaine (not iceburg lettuce since it has no nutrious value) to his/her diet.<br>  <br>  As for the shell looking like it is bleeding, I would say your turtle could possibly have shell rot. Shell rot is a fungal or bacterial infection in the turtles shell. Too much moisture, too little moisture, unsanitary conditions, improper diet, improper heating, and improper lighting can all lead to shell rot. If you think your turtle may have serious shell rot I would definitely take your tutrle to a vet right away so the condition does not worsen or else you may end up with a dead turtle on your hands. And I would would say if he looks like he's bleeding your dealing with a more serious case. <br>  <br>  But in any case I would definitely take him to a vet because even when my RES had ear abcesses, if let untreated he could have died. So i think it would just be best to get your little guy in.

49BRunStaa	you should first make her a comfy soft place where she is isolated and comfy. after she gets acclimated to it she will most like pick that place to give birth. most animals don't want to be in the open when they give birth so an mostly enclosed place is best. then the signs to look for are continual turning around in her bed and trying to get comfortable. she may or may not try to further the birth by licking herself. some do and some don't. and she wont let you get near her. especially if you havent had her for very long. things like that will happen. <br>  <br>  hope this helps and good luck with kittens! :)|`|g6MiGWuJaa	my cat was very loving then i saw her stomach heaving up and down and her water broke!  its very easy to tell u will know when it happens i got a box of towels and put my cat in it and she delivered 6 kittens she tried to eat all the yucky stuff but i got tired and wanted them in clean box so i took them out and cut the cord of the sack and put them in the clean box.  you will want them in something and not on your floor cause its very very messy|`|quPY9x7qaa	just like humans she will start having contractions when she's ready. you need to make her a box or area with some old clothes ( since she's attached to you use yours so she can smell you) to make her comfortable.

Most cats cannot handle cows milk. If he wants to give her a milk treat then get cats milk at the pet store. Its made so that the cats can process it without getting sick. <br>  <br>  You could also try catnip. Taking her on a walk outside (they make cat harnesses). A feather on a stick. Hard cat treats. Cat gravy (again in the pet store). You could try a feliway plug in to help with the depression. It plugs in like an air freshener in an outlet. It emits pheromones that can be soothing and may help.<br>  <br>  Even if she is enjoying the milk if it is causing diarrhea that is stressing her body and at her age/medical condition you want to avoid any added stress.<br>  <br>  Also: If she has diabetes its a good idea to check with your vet before you start her on a new food, treats or any type of food. If she is taking insulin the change in food can cause some trouble with regulating things. She might need a lower or higher dose of the insulin depending on the food source.

AA11887983	There are a lot of dogs that live long, happy lives with this condition.  Most important things to know are that he cannot become overweight or get over heated.  Those will be bad things for him.  <br>  <br>  He may need periodic treatment with cough suppressants and corticosteroids, but if he seems to be ok right now, he may not need anything right away.  Most of the meds for this are pretty inexpensive, especially if he doesn't have to be on them all that much. <br>  <br>  I say, if you are willing to give him a home, do it.  Worry about surgery if the need arises.  You can always have your vet give you an idea on what the surgery would cost, and put some money away for a rainy day.   <br>  <br>  Good luck, and give him a chance!|`|K6fasl6kaa	the collapsed trachea will probably be ok for now.  keep in mind that he is heart worm positive and find out if treatment will have any bearing on his other condition.  this case is not really a weighing of pros and cons.  it is rather dependent on you and if you have the resources to care for potential problems and if you are that special person meant to give this guy the best life he can have.  he should be your only pet, if that is possible.  chihuahuas are delicate and get themselves in trouble because they can pick fights with larger animals.  they can be injured in rough play.  i dearly love my 11 year old chi, Cisco; but will admit it is not a breed for everyone.  if you are the person to make this large commitment and has the unselfish love it will take, may God bless your effort.|`|XmJZkFuMaa	Most of the dogs I've met with collapsed trachea had that happen because of people walking them with the collar and yanking them or letting their front legs come off the ground.  Usually, all that was required is to make sure you use a harness so that no pressure is ever on their throat and avoid all pressure on their throat.  You might want to check with a vet, but the dogs we worked with typically... that's all they needed, just a harness.  It DID lower their life-expectancy though.  But it sounds like he'd be a great dog.  :)<br>  <br>  Add:  Sounds like he wouldn't need surgery, and his age to me wouldn't be a turn off (small dogs live a long time...)  If you like him, I'd go for it.
AM7CgQ4daa	she may have been dumped after they got rid of the puppies, of maybe they kept one of the cute puppies and dumped mum.   If you decide to keep her, you need a vet visit as she is probably full of worms and fleas so get this checked out at the same time.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Well it could be possible that she hid the puppies, but it sounds like she was dumped.  When a dog gets dumped in my yard, I take it to my vets.  She knows who owns what dogs, so she is likely to know who owned the dog, and she is also great about finding new homes for dogs because she won't put a dog down.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	Feed her,put her on a long leash and see if she will take you to her pups.If she doesn't seem to be interested in looking for them,then they are likely dead or the owners dumped her off to get rid of her. If you're going to keep her,please have her spayed.The milk will dry up by itself.|`|taLD45Sqaa	She may be a puppy mill Mommy. Sometimes when  the dogs get too old the owners just abandon the Mom somewhere ( given she was dropped with a blanket... chances are this is what happened). Very cruel. But on the off chance she does have pups outside somewhere, take a good look around and give her a good meal. Call your local animal shelter for other suggestions and so they know to keep an eye out for Mommyless pups as well.|`|dWed21jUaa	She might have some pups out there some where. Give her a nice meal, clean her up if she's dirty, and put her back out. Maybe follow her to see if she goes to them. <br>  <br>  I have this happen with cats, and it'd be cruel to keep mom inside when there's possibly pups out there some where.|`|wUg7iYU1aa	Feed her, put a leash on her and see if she takes you to them, more than likely she will run right to them..Then you can save the pups also.|`|MZ5deUKWaa	If her puppies are somewhere to be found she will find them, but it could be a good distance from where you are. And the puppy mill thing is a sad and cruel, but true reality. Put some posters up concerning found mother dog and no puppies, tell them to contact you if puppies are found. Considering you found her with a blanket, someone most likely abandon her. Animal cruelty.....i don't see how people like that can live with themselves.
ltIuUBXNaa	Be aware that you may be short one dragon soon if the size difference is very noticeable.The little one might be digging to create a hiding spot. The best solution is to separate them, but you can keep the tanks within sight of each other. The larger one will continue to thrive and the little one will either be eaten or die from stress/ lack of food, etc. You can let them out together supervised for interaction, but that is all I would do. At least until you are positive of the sex of both and until they are a lot closer in size.|`|6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	Bearded dragons should always be house alone to begin with.

Even a 4 to 6 week old doberman would be considerably larger, and it doesn't look younger than 4 wks.  Even a kelpie, as someone suggested, should be larger.  It might be part min pin (Miniature Pincher) or a German Pincher which is a bit larger.  They are similar because the min pin was bred down from the German Pincher.|`|nWlz56ubaa	Based on the fact that you know it is a larger breed dog, and the colouring in the markings, a doberman mix.  The shading of the colours would strongly suggest that to me.  Although what he/she is mixed with, no clue.  Side note:  that's a HUGE shoe, or a SMALL puppy!  lol!!!!|`|WqVawp0Kaa	looks like a lab/pit mix|`|pwiRMmicaa	looks like a doberman or labrador|`|MZ5deUKWaa	it's a little hard to tell. if thats blue eyes i'm seeing i would say part huskey.
AA11887983	I don't know.  They can be published in journals and things like that, so why not?  You might want to investigate the HIPA laws, on patient confidentiality.  Vets have some of them too, but mostly they apply to the client.   I guess the question is why would someone want to see that?|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Animals can't be identified as easily as ppl & many owners can't pick out their own dog from a group of the same breed.  We've had owners take home the wrong - same name & breed - to call back later saying my son says this dog isn't our Pepper.  I probably wouldn't like to see my pet displayed but in educating others I would give my permission.

To my way of thinking, it is okay.  And, as far as I know, it is not illegal.  Nor is "consent" required as it would be in the case of humans.  <br>  I am a retired D.O.  My brother-in-law is a vet.  I treated humans; he treats animals.<br>  There is a difference.<br>  Why would you try to get photos depicting medical treatment of animals removed from someone's facebook?<br>  I think you are overreacting and butting into something that is not your business.|`|Ms8b2kISaa	If I wasn't the one who posted it, then no, I wouldn't be too happy about it at all. But, if most of the injuries being shown are pretty horrific, then maybe we can assume that the pets were either never claimed, or maybe were signed over to the vet for whatever reason after it was brought in for treatment...? In which case, I suppose the "owner" wouldn't really have a say in it...but I agree with you, if it is a pet that still has an owner, and the owner didn't agree to the pics being posted, I think it's wrong!|`|dWed21jUaa	I wouldn't mind. I think photos of animal cruelty need to be seen, people understand better seeing rather than reading about it. Y'know?<br>  <br>  Permission should be given thogh
rdcxVqfxaa	Your best bet would be to check your local newspaper daily, check trade and sell magazines, or look at bulletin boards at stores in your area. You could also check adoption sites online such as petfinder.com. Just type in the breed of bird you're interested in on the left hand side, type in your zip code, and click search. Good luck.|`|kC8JHWVQaa	Look at ads in local newspapers and on your comp for your town or state alot of people right now are giving animals up to people who can care for them better than the owner now might be able to find a bird with this. It's sad but its being done all over the country.
tPGxPDvBaa	Their  coat acts as insulation from the heat & cold &  should never really be shaved down.  Trimmed is fine but not shaved.  If it is cold out, get your dog a coat or sweater if you worry.  If hot, shaving them down doesn't help but means they can become overheated quicker or sunburned.|`|AA11887983	Their body temperature is usually about 101.5 - 102.5, farenheit.  That increase over human body temperature is based on the fact that they have a higher metabolism that we do, and they have fur.  They are used to it.  Your dog should be fine with hair, if that is what you are asking.

XI2iylR4aa	Rabbits have two different types of poop, one of which they eat...here's a page about it:<br>  <a href="http://www.bio.miami.edu/hare/poop.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bio.miami.edu/hare/poop.html</a><br>  <br>  As for doing it on your bed, that's unfortunate!  If she's peeing on your bed, she might be marking it as her territory, or she might not know how to get back to her litterbox.  Whenever we let our bun on the bed, we put her litterbox on the bed too, so she always has a good place to go.<br>  <br>  I don't think rabbits can "hold it" like dogs can, so don't be upset.  If you get her spayed, she might have better litter habits, but since she is young, she might not be old enough yet.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ak9DrBSwaa	If raising your bed isn't an option, what about blocking it off when bunny is out, so she can't get on it. A piece of cardboard or a posterboard would do the trick and you could fold it awat when not needed.|`|R2YvUudQaa	a lot of rabbits eat their poop....mines did|`|5TM9P8tsaa	*They recycle.

If it is painful, it may just be a local reaction or infection.  Don't worry too much.  It will probably not affect the kittens at this point.
AxENuJahaa	Society finches and budgies can eat the same seed.  The basic seed mix for both includes a variety of millet and other small seeds.  The main difference is that the mix for budgies includes some larger seeds such as safflower seeds that finches cannot crack and eat.  The main concern with putting them all in the same cage is that the budgie may chew on the feet of the finches.  Please do not turn the society finches loose.  Either take them back to a pet store or try to rehome them if you choose not to keep them.  Finches are not the type of bird that will sit on your finger and talk to you like the larger birds do.  They can be very fun to watch though.  They would do best in a larger flight cage where you could sit back and watch their antics.  They can become familiar with you and may eventually take treats out of your hands.  They like a variety of greens such as kale, parsley, carrot tops, etc.  Your budgie will enjoy the same types of treats as well as a variety of cooked veggies such as carrots, peas, corn, squash, tomatoes, etc.  The budgie may also enjoy pasta, rice, potatoes, and bread.  Just remember that treats should be no more than 5 % of the bird's total diet.|`|OyNJTWaiaa	Setting the finches free is not a good idea. If you dont want them, sell them or offer them free to a good home. <br>  The budgie cannot be put in the same cage as the finches or the finches will suffer. You are never meant to mix straight bill birds with hooked bill birds. <br>  They can all eat the same seed but please do not house them togther. I often give my budgie finch mix as a change.|`|fyrj50Braa	Take the finches back to the pet shop if you don't want them, you may not get your money back but it's better them throwing them out in the wild as there not wild birds.|`|38ab6659a0292a00b09330a5fca5c2deaa	If you release the finches you are breaking federal laws.  The finches will probably die quickly also.  Some birds get along, others not.  Try it and be ready to remove the fighters if it doesn't work.  The food is different.  While they will eat some of each others its healthiest to feed them what formulated for that breed.|`|NW2zyR3Baa	don't just set your finches free that would be crazy if you dont want them find them a good home and you really should have researched into them before getting them. then you wouldnt have ended up with birds that didnt fit what you wanted. <br>  common sense people please.
taLD45Sqaa	If it was broken you would know! When my pup was young she had runny poops and it turned out to be a sensitivity to the fillers in the dog food. We switched her to a higher quality food with no grain etc. and she was better afterwards.|`|UETAqR8Taa	well i believe he should have an xray too be sure to start. he cant say say hey " i may have broken my leg".You wouldnt wait a few days to see if you had broken your leg. secondly his puppy poop. puppys have sloppy poo sometimes. and if this a change from his normal habits SINCE his accident, thats even more reason to close your computer and take him to the vet. now. he could be in very bad pain.|`|YA3JJwE3aa	Your dog needs higher quality dog food.
AA11887983	Ok, now that he has 2 problems, will you take him to the vet?  Limping should not last more than 24 hours after a fall like that.  And diarrhea, or soft stool, is never normal in a dog.  He needs to see his vet.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	Maybe he needs to go to the vet.  Dogs don't always yelp and cry and have a fit when they have a broken bone, or when they are ill - it could even be a hairline fracture.<br>  <br>  You didn't mention the pup's age.|`|2f39231b33c0ad3020523d896c03fc90aa	I'm not sure if it was from falling, but does the puppy eat solid food?<br>  If not it could be the soft food, or has any of your family gave the puppy food that is not good for the puppies diet?|`|322582d735a927f0dbcd0ead5902a454aa	take your pup to a vet stat and have him checked over  the fall made have done more damage than just hurt his leg|`|RIiy7APbaa	I recently took my dog (and a stool sample) to the vet because her stool was lightly colored and soft. It could really be a variety of things and the only way of knowing for sure what is causing that symptom is to go to a vet. If you have a fresh stool sample (within 24 hours of being deposited) I would recommend taking that as well.<br>  <br>  Just a few of the possibilities to the stool problem is bacterial infection, parasites, food allergy, a sudden change in diet, and it could even be related to the hurt leg. My vet told me that lesions on the spine (sounds serious but it isn't really) can form when a dog twists its back around and causes one to form, i.e. when playing (or in your case, maybe from the fall). He told me that this can cause a change in stool as well. It is easily fixed if your vet has the proper, painless-for-your-dog tool on hand to fix the lesions.<br>  <br>  As for the leg, the sooner you get it taken care of, the less chance of there being permanent damage.<br>  <br>  I hope your puppy heals quickly!|`|nWlz56ubaa	part one:  If your pup fell off the chair more than 24 hours ago and is still holding his leg up, see a vet and get radio-graphs taken.  Dog's will instinctively mask their pain, and their crying is not a good indication of whether they are in pain or not.<br>  <br>  If the injury is soft tissue, you should see some resolution within 24 hours, but if he keeps limping, or holding the leg up, you need to get him to a vet.  Ideally you should have him evaluated regardless, even if he has stopped limping.  I saw a dog the other day that was bearing weight on his leg slightly, and not crying in pain.  We didn't think he had broken his leg based on his response.  But sure enough, leg broken.<br>  <br>  part two:  The soft, pudding stools.....if you noticed this at the same time as the injury to the leg, dogs can get stress diarhea.  So, the stools can be related to that.  But, has your pup been wormed for intestinal parasites?  Many parasites (worms) will cause pudding like stool.  This can also be caused by his diet.  What is his diet, and have you recently changed it?  <br>  <br>  As you can see, there really is no easy answer to your question......
OyNJTWaiaa	Gull-a-holics anonymous.|`|FY2Ezviaaa	WHO KNOW
mjy4oRvDaa	Where's the litter box?  Maybe as you get closer to the area where the litter box is and the kitten follows you, it'll catch the scent of litter and want to use it.  So maybe just taking the kitten to the litter box before you prepare your food will be enough so it can go.  Then you can clean up the mess right away so there's no smell, wash up, and prepare your meal.<br>  <br>  Better yet, lead your kitten to the litter box a half hour or hour before your meal time so it won't associate you preparing dinner with potty time.|`|K4lRi1fjaa	G'day Limbaugh the Hutt,<br>  <br>  Thank you for your question.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that you look at moving the litterbox so the smell won't be so bad when you decide to eat. Perhaps she sees you eating as a trigger for going to the toilet so that might be a problem.<br>  <br>  Regards|`|rU7ZjIHKaa	Well, if you spray her when she uses the litter box, that may give her the impression that she is doing the wrong thing, and she will just poop elsewhere.<br>  <br>  The only thing you can do is clean the litter box before you eat.|`|pEfEOuu9aa	sorry but that's just the time she has to go you cant stop her . try buy feeding her earlier or alil later so shell have to go to the bathroom at different time|`|alccyiawaa	if your feeding your cat in the laundry, and her bowl is in their aswell, she can smell the kitty litter so she uses it.<br>  <br>  maybe you should feed her in the kitchen, then let her go to the kitty litter after if she wants to, she will no where to find it.<br>  <br>  and eat your dinner first, then feed her after. thats pretty simple !!<br>  <br>  if she annoys you or something while you are eating your dinner first, just lock her in the laundry while you eat, then feed her.<br>  <br>  <br>  easy|`|FH4fF71caa	does she potty IN her food? if she does then i don't know what to tell you. if she just decides to make room before she eats again, watch her and when you see her looking for a comfy place, pick her up soon as she squats, pat her bottom (to spank her), tell her no and take her to the litter box and make sure she stays in it until she's done, then take her back to her food. i've had PLENTY of cats that had oodles of kittens so i've figured out how to try to train them. LOL  if that don't work, then i don't know what to tell you other than start feeding her outside so she'll have the biggest litter box she could ever imagine.|`|TwBgfWFraa	Thats a tough one. Can you place your cats litter box in the bathroom? That way when she goes to use the bathroom when you are about to eat, you can close the door in there to let her poop so the smell dosent come out while you are eating. You can then let her out when she is finished and just keep the bathroom door closed with the litterbox in there until you are finished eating.<br>  You defidently do not want to use a spray bottle to scold her becaus eit will teach her that going to the potty in the box is bad and she will begin to go on the floor, or other places you dont want her pooping!!!!|`|Rw7gi86Naa	Changing his diet to a high quality food will help with the smell a little, and will make him healthier.<br>  <br>  Always scoop litter boxes at LEAST once a day, and change the litter at least once a week.  When cleaning the box, use a mild detergent and finish by rinsing thoroughly with very hot water.  Never use strong-smelling pine cleansers, bleach or ammonia.  Rinsing the box with boiling water is also effective.  With covered litter boxes, the smell can be worse, especially with high humidity, so you must be willing to clean it more.|`|UdICTUnaaa	forever clearly didnt understand the question<br>  <br>  no do not use the spray bottle, your kitten isnt doing anything wrong<br>  <br>  move the litter box into the bathroom, or as the first person said, clean the mess up right away and wash up.<br>  <br>  and get a stronger stomach
34uWa9kHaa	A dog will drink when it's thirsty.    When they play hard they drink more.    <br>  <br>  You really do not have anything to worry about unless she stops drinking water completely then she could become dehydrated. <br>  <br>  As long as she is drinking just keep doing what you are doing.|`|nWlz56ubaa	I think a good rule of thumb is 1 cup per 5lbs of body weight.  This is what I heard a doctor tell an owner today.  <br>  <br>  But it is difficult to acertain how much is not enough, there are so many factors that are involved.<br>  <br>  Such as, is she eating wet and canned food?  Is she only eating canned food?  There is water in canned food, this can decrease how much water she actually drinks.<br>  <br>  How big is her water bowl, to accurately guage how much she is drinking so you can tell if it is a problem, measure how much you are offering her per day.<br>  <br>  Then you can contact your veterinarian with that number, and based on physical exam, and other dietary needs of your puppy, they can tell if she is drinking enough.<br>  <br>  When in doubt, call your vet.|`|065bc4464ecaa537a95fed387f27401faa	Some dogs drink more than others, and when you leave the bowl down where it can access water all the time they usually don't drink as much.  Like us humans they ill drink a little all day.  I wouldn't worry about it as long as it is drinking and eating.  If the dog stops drinking completely or stops eating then get it to a vet.  If you are really worried call your vet and ask him or her about it maybe that will ease your mind a little.

Mostly animals.  My guess would be that someone is either getting home from work or leaving for work since it occurs at the same time every night.  If it was a wild animal I seriously doubt that it starts roaming around your area at the same time every night.  The odds of that happening would be slim to none.  If you are scared when it happens then I would call the police ahead of time and tell them what has been occurring and see if they would mind patrolling your area at that time for a few nights.  If you live alone make sure you tell them that, they will be more likely to check it out for you!<br>  <br>  Personally, I would get a male friend and go sit on my porch a few minutes prior to when the dogs usually start to bark and check it out for myself.  I do know the only way I could have any peace at night would to either check it out myself or have the police do it.  I live in California in a small mountain community and if it was happening here I wouldn't be able to sleep until I had an answer.  I had a Rottweiler for nine years that I had to have put down last week and I am really missing her letting me know what is going on outside.

oMmBhWK4aa	The most common way snails get into tanks is by hitchhiking on live plants. You can't see the eggs most of the time as they're almost invisible and small snails may be hiding under leaves. Therefore you need to disinfect aquarium plants before placing into your tank. A 20-30min soak in potassium permanganate solution in a separate bucket, then rinse well with water to remove residues. Snails may also appear in plant-less tanks, maybe floating in stealth mode in water from bags containing your new fish?<br>  <br>  There are many different varieties of snails, of differing sizes and reproductive ability. Some can't breed in freshwater but unfortunately yours don't fall in that category. Some are both males & females, so any 2 of them can breed. The bad news is that it is unlikely you can be sure of getting rid of them all, at best you keep the population under control.<br>  <br>  You can add snail eating fish but with caution. Freshwater puffers love snails but can be very aggressive to other fish including own species. Loaches and labyrinth fish (betta, gourami, paradise fish) are also snail eaters but certain loaches like the clown loach grows too large and labyrinth fish are semi-aggressive to other fish. In general most fish might eat crushed snails (you do the crushing, which is a hassle) except for puffers & large fish with strong jaws to help themselves.<br>  <br>  If you're very patient, you can spend 10 mins daily to pick up snails with tweezers & dispose them. But there's an easier way by using blanched lettuce leaves. Before you sleep at night, use small stones to weigh down a few leaves at different locations on the tank bottom. You can also anchor a few leaves on the water surface with part of the leaf touching the tank wall; I use a large plastic loop fastener attached to a rubber sucker. In the morning, presto, you just need to throw away leaves full of those little buggers clinging there. Repeat daily until the snail population is almost gone.<br>  <br>  The main reason why snails thrive is because of excess food available. Make sure you do not feed too much to your fish, just a few pinches once a day. Remove any uneaten food after 30 mins, except for bottom feeder pellets that can last longer.<br>  <br>  Snails can be a big help to control algae but some also turn live plants into Swiss cheese and may breed far more than rabbits. Don't use snail killing chemicals except as last resort as your fish, plants & beneficial bacteria may become victims of this bomb. You'll then have to start everything from scratch, including cleaning out gravel that may have dead rotting snails buried inside.|`|F5JXQUEAaa	The way I understand is that theye from the plants. But they are different than garden snails. It's those little ones right? They actually look kinda cool and I don't think they'll upset the balance of the tank. Maybe get a big fish, like an Angel or Discuss. They'll eat it. . . but they'll also eat smaller baby fish. Up to you.|`|kTMkP2mtaa	Is the tank outside?

7b4cd4909e3fddb3fc14d5677ec83183aa	hi, i looked into this a while go, if you have a corner tank then i would recommend the external filtration system, i think it is better but easier to reach especially if you are short because it is a long way to the back of the tank to get in to clean it out etc. If you are having small community fish again the external would be better this way they wont get stuck in the filter, i hate that when it happens. Again if you have an internal filter you will see it, and they are so big you would need lots of plants etc to hide it. Hope this helps, good luck with your choice, Maria|`|oMmBhWK4aa	I suppose you mean the Juwel Trigon 190. Although Juwel filters are good, they really do take up space inside and there's not much space in a corner tank. I also removed my Juwel filter and used an external canister filter eventually. Once you've converted to a canister filter, you can't imagine going back to other types of filter again!|`|d8f443bc582285db859040a0c5e47adcaa	i would always use external filters over internal for a few reasons .They are easier to clean as you have the canister containing the filter medium,usually in separate manageable sections,no dripping as you lift from the tank as in internal,quite larger filtering and bacterial area,overall Superiority.|`|AA12310378	The Juwel filters are excellent if you are keeping small fish. <br>  They only need upgrading if you get the largest Juwel tanks and want to keep big fish but you can use both.|`|fZgoUty4aa	BILLY B IS RIGHT A OUT SIDE THE FISH TANK IS FAR FAR BETTER THAN AN INSIDE FILTER|`|yT9gVGTUaa	I have an external one, I used to have 2 fluval 4's in my 190 litre tank then we got the Fluval 405 and it's excellent, the water is crystal clear constantly and it is so easy to clean and maintain, plus you have more room in your tank without a bulky filter in there - I would recommend an external filter over an internal anyday.|`|s7jwYBdqaa	external is the best i have pulled fish from an internal one to often|`|cbbbH1Reaa	get a canister filter it is a good choice but i personally would use a stump filter what fish do u have in there|`|ur5wDhkMaa	I'm in agreement with the external filter brigade, it's always going to out perform an internal/built in filter. If they have a fault it's they don't create enough surface agitation for gas exchange and need  a bit of help from an air pump ornament.<br>  <br>  Nothing stopping you using both, change the medium in the Juwel and run it purely as a bio filter? Just fill it with bio balls or synthetic fibres and forget about it.
Vcg2QuDWaa	He looks like a tuxedo cat, who may be part ragdoll.|`|16XpYCBmaa	I have no idea about any cat breeds, most cats look all the same except different colors. To me he looks like a regular pet cat. i have had many cats in the past but never knew what kind. I have one now and he is just a light orange cat. Your cat is really cute though :)|`|TKQZUhPBaa	im not to sure<br>  i agree tho-part ragdoll|`|Rw7gi86Naa	He's probably a domestic short hair.<br>  <br>  Most cats we own are mixed breed domestic cats, not purebreds. If your cat has some similar features as a purebred cat which you've seen, it doesn't necessarily mean your cat is that breed. For instance, a shorthair cat that was born in America is not necessarily an American Shorthair cat. Just as not every black cat is a Bombay, and not every gray cat is a Chartreux. Also terms like calico, tortoise shell, tabby, and tuxedo are words used to describe the color and pattern; they are not breeds. <br>  <br>  A domestic shorthaired cat (DSH) is a cat fancy term used to describe a shorthaired cat that does not have a pedigree or belong to a recognized cat breed. The domestic shorthair should not be confused with the American Shorthair, which is a Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) recognized breed.<br>  Domestic shorthaired cats are characterized by a wide range of coloring and typically 'revert to type' after a few generations, which means they express their coats as a tabby. This can be any color or combination of colors. They also exhibit a wide range of physical characteristics and, as a result, domestic shorthaired cats in different countries tend to look different in body shape and size, as they are working from differing gene pools. DSH cats in Asia tend to have a build similar to a purebred Siamese cat or Tonkinese cat, while European and American varieties have a thicker, heavier build.|`|GNq2rmrNaa	my friend has got a cat very similar to that. it looks nearly identical but my friends is a girl not a boy so it's not as large.|`|4aAhEK9daa	He doesn't look the least bit like a Ragdoll.  Ragdolls have pointed markings, blue eyes, a different shaped head, different shaped eyes, ears, body.  There's also large cats - this cat looks very small.  Where on earth do you see Ragdoll?<br>  <br>  Your cat doesn't bear traits of ANY breed.  It's a cat of no particular breed - just like over 97% of the cats on this planet.  As for the eye colour, unless a domestic cat has pointed markings then it's eyes are ALWAYS green, yellow or a shade in between.  Your cat's sweetness isn't anything to do with a breed - he's a just a sweet cat.<br>  <br>  Pedigreed cats tend to be sold by breeders altered - or under contract to alter - unless the cat is part of the cattery's breeding program.  So it's not very often that you find cats that are "part" a specific breed of cat.  They're just cats.|`|pUYfE1Zraa	he's just a cute cat.
AA11403032	I'm not sure that she's actually done anything illegal.<br>  <br>  But clearly she's misrepresented the sale to you.  If you've got her address why don't you go round there with the bill for having the cat neutered and chipped and demand that she refunds you the money.<br>  <br>  You could threaten to sue her for the money (although in reality it probably wouldn't be worth pursuing it through the courts).<br>  <br>  At least if you confront her on her doorstep you might also get to see if there are any signs of her running a business, if there are any more cats about, and if any are being mistreated.|`|d51rpXduaa	Can u get hold of the person who sold it to you?<br>  <br>  It is unlikely she got it from a shelter, because they are usually more expensive sometimes than they should be, as well, they would have been vet checked- vaccinated and snipped (i volunteer at one).<br>  <br>  Im not sure you can report her. Maybe you should have asked for the vet papers. Sorry.|`|VhWll8Vjaa	Unless you signed some sort of kitten/sales contract, there really isn't alot you can do.<br>  <br>  She isn't really doing anything illegal as such.

QKn1oUnEaa	There is a reason a dog is called a man's best friend.  They are the most forgiving, loving animal.  I've always found it fascinating that even a severely abused dog will remain loyal to it's owner.  I wouldn't worry about the bond between pup and tot because a puppy and a toddler can only remember as far back as to the last loving hand that touched it.  Both are loving little tykes, puppy and tot.  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  Actually, a dog usually feeds from it's mother for six weeks and is normally put up for adoption at eight weeks in order to ensure that it properly digests solids.  I have however adopted a chihuahua at five weeks and it was fine as long as it was on soft foods.  The mother's milk had dried up and along with it, her desire to care for her puppies.  Of course, the puppy I had adopted had extenuating circumstances but the above is the norm.|`|065bc4464ecaa537a95fed387f27401faa	Like most kids they are to rough with puppies, but I am sure the pup will grow to trust him again.  Give the puppy a little time and as you said make sure not to leave the puppy alone with the child any more.  I suggest maybe sitting in the floor with the puppy and holding it and petting it lightly and then ask the child to come sit with you and with his hand stroke the puppy lightly with you guiding his hand, so he doesn't do it rough.  Rite now the puppy is scared just give it some time.  Good luck I hope this helps|`|pVm7QTWjaa	Obviously, the puppy is scared of him at the moment, but the dog will like him and it will take some time for the puppy to trust him. The puppy is just scared that the little boy will hurt him. Good luck with it!|`|2BOnGvBAaa	NEVER. <br>  <br>  I wouldnt trust him.|`|5rfnEQnGaa	Firstly, this is a disaster waiting to happen.  A small child and small puppy should never have been left alone together, ever.<br>  <br>  NO DOG< adult or puppy should be left alone with a small child ever, no matter how well they get on. <br>  <br>  This puppy is far too young to have left its mother !  <br>  <br>  Legally, puppies should stay with their mother and siblings until 8 weeks, but with tiny breeds like chihuahuas/Yorkies, etc. they should not leave their birth home until 10-12 weeks minimum !<br>  <br>  Return this poor, traumatised puppy to its breeder now until it is another 6 weeks older and then treat it with more care, it's a fragile little dog. ! If you do this, it may simply forget this dreadful occurance and be more stable again when it is old enough to be with you. <br>  <br>  p.s. No reputable breeder would have let you take a puppy away from it's home at that young age.|`|YRTYXfggaa	Luckily the dog is a puppy!  An older dog could have bit or hurt the child, and they are a lot harder to regain trust from after an incident like that.  I would keep reintroducing the child to the puppy, keeping both of them calm and comfortable.  Always be present, and reward for good behavior.  They will be playing together again in no time!
NlvghuIkaa	The Weimaraner is an excellent breed of dog you could use in hunting or at least trials. I have just begun club retrieving which is similar to real hunting in game form. <br>  <br>  The handler of the dog must get into stance with a gun that only shoots caps, as if to represent the sound of something real. The dog must wait in a staying position until a scent-filled toy duck is tossed through the air. He is then told to retrieve and run back with the duck in mouth ready to hand it over when told. Terrains also vary, however when it comes to judging there are few things to keep in mind.. <br>  <br>  Judges mark on things such as..<br>  >Steadiness<br>  >Obedience<br>  >Walking to heel<br>  >Style, eagerness, action<br>  >Nose, ears, eyes<br>  >Perseverance<br>  >Marking<br>  >Direction out<br>  >Direction in<br>  >Delivery<br>  >Hard and soft mouth<br>  <br>  Each one of these traits would be needed in real hunting. Personally, I find the game just as fun still the dogs enjoy both like anything. Your best option would be to look around at any clubs who may be willing to take you onto the real levels of hunting.|`|ZYOJQdjyaa	<a href="http://www.sfweims.com/weimversitility.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sfweims.com/weimversitility.h...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mydogbreed.com/weimaraner/weimaraner-training.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.mydogbreed.com/weimaraner/wei...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.trainpetdog.com/Weimaraner/about-weimaraner.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.trainpetdog.com/Weimaraner/ab...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.canismajor.com/dog/weimar.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.canismajor.com/dog/weimar.htm...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.weimaranerhunters.com/WMH-School.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.weimaranerhunters.com/WMH-Sch...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dog-behavior-training.co.uk/weimaraner.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dog-behavior-training.co.uk/w...</a>|`|ylQXC2Mraa	My father has Brittney dogs that he hunts with all the time. The best advice is to school the dog with professionals. its a little costly but the results are spectacular.

Okzc9Hl6aa	The breed standard (in the US; the FCI standard is similar but not identical) calls for Maltese to be less than 7 pounds (4-6 pounds preferred.) Reputable breeders should be aiming for a dog which falls into this range. However, the popularity of the Maltese means that there are many, many unscupulous breeders who breed undersized 'teacup' maltese and oversized dogs (primarily females- bigger dogs can whelp more puppies) because they have 'papers'. <br>  <br>  I have seen 'purebred' Maltese as large as 20 pounds (probably was not a purebred, but the owner bought her as an adorable puppy and certainly didn't care that she ended up large.) <br>  <br>  As far as their potty habits, they need several walks a day like any dog, and the amount they eliminate will be based partially on their diet- a higher quality diet with fewer fillers (less grain, particularly corn) will result in fewer/smaller 'piles'. Like many toy breeds, they have a higher possibility towards liver shunts and various other problems than other breeds, which can cause all sorts of urinary problems, including excessive urination. <br>  <br>  Can't help you on the cost, but I would recommend contacting the KCI, which appears to be your national kennel club - <a href="http://www.thekci.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thekci.org/</a> - they probably maintain a list of breeders of each breed who ar emembers of their member clubs.|`|uXbl1Zbhaa	My dog is a poodle maltese mix and weighs 9 pounds.|`|YuTFG3feaa	You would have to call around to local breeders, go online, or check the for sale ads in the paper to get a price range.  I have 2 Maltese, one weighs 3lbs10ounces and the other 4-3/4lbs.  My dad's girlfriend has one that weighs 12lbs, which is the biggest I have ever seen.  The possible size a full grown Maltese puppy may be can usually be judged pretty accurately by looking at his parents.  With my little one that was not an accurate way of judging her possible size full grown because she is a runt.  My suggestion to get an idea of size before even going to look at puppies is to inquire about the size of each parent and if the parents are available for you to see.  You can cut down on a lot of travel time to look at puppies this way by eliminating pups that may be to large or small for your taste over the phone.<br>  <br>  I hope you enjoy your newly purchased Maltese as much as I do mine.  They have wonderful dispositions and are a very loving breed.  LOL<br>  <br>  Addition:  Just realized I didn't answer your "potty" question.  If by having a lot of potty like a Labrador you mean the size of their bowel movements, there is no camparison at all.  The amount of bowel movement a Maltese has is WAY smaller than what a Lab would produce.  it's practically nothing in comparison.|`|dn96x5W1aa	Maltese are wonderful small dogs so no, they don't get huge.  They are a bit smaller than a Beagle but are not complete spaz dogs like some other breeds.  Also no, they don't have huge droppings like a lab because of their small size.  <br>  <br>  As for the price, I'm really unsure.  You can probably find a $30 maltese puppy in your local shelter.  They always have good dogs there.  You can probably also get a at a local breeder, but their fines are not cheep.  I bought my dog from a breeder (a mini schnauzer) and I had to pay $425 - and that was at a discount rate because he was the runt.  So unless you want to run out your pocket book, check out your local shelters.  <br>  <br>  Hope I answered your questions!  :D

But many adult dogs are put down for simply the reason they have no home because people go for the much cuter puppies! <br>  <br>  Some things to consider, size of yard, size of house, height of fenced in yard, as well as your energy levels if your lazy-you don't want a high energy dog such as Pointer, but if you active, you don't want a dog that not very active such as a Pug, as well as the grooming requirements, also another thing is to consider if you have children, many small dogs are incrediable fragile and can easily be killed by being dropped on the patio & also alot of them don't tolerante typical small children behave, their incrediable snappy!, also another thing to consider is your experience!<br>  <br>  It is so important to match the breed to you, for not only your energery levels, but also the time, people on yahoo will recommend their favourite breed, but it doesn't mean they'll suit you at all.<br>  I've seen some people recommend husky for 1st time owners! husky are a specialised dog, and are NOT for 1st time owners.<br>  <br>  Dogs for children-Even great for children under 8years old, there NOT as active as your lead to believe!<br>  <br>  Dogs that require 30mintues or more twice a day & a good run in fenced in yard.Also good 1st timer dogs, however not for everyone!<br>  <br>  Labrador <br>  Activity:   Delightful, high-spirited, and energetic, the Labrador Retriever requires a great deal of exercise. They enjoy family play sessions, securely leashed walks, swimming, and a safely fenced yard to run and romp freely.<br>   <br>  Golden Retriver<br>  Activity:   The Golden Retriever requires daily exercise. They enjoy play sessions with their family, retrieving balls and other toys. They will do okay in an apartment dwelling provided they are sufficiently exercised. Golden Retrievers are moderately active indoors and does best with a medium to large sized securely fenced yard.<br>  <br>  Newfoundland <br>  Activity:   The Newfoundland is slow moving and has a tendency to be lazy. They enjoy and benefit from play sessions, daily walks, and swimming. They are relatively inactive indoors. The Newfie will do okay in an apartment or condominium dwelling provided they are given sufficient exercise. They enjoy a run in a small fenced yard.<br>  <br>  Scotch Collie-One of the few herding/working breeds that are actual very placid! One of the very few that are also good 1st timer dogs, this is one of the few working breed, that adapt to living in apartment! Of cause it would require a more exercise in this case. However most working breeds of dogs DO not make good apartment dogs! <br>  <br>  Dogs for Very highly active owners-2 long walks daily with total of minimum of 4km & need lots of mental stimulion too<br>  Standard and Miniature Poodles<br>  American Eskimo dog<br>  Activity:   This breed must have regular daily exercise. They enjoy securely leashed walks or playing in an enclosed yard. The American Eskimo Dog is active indoors and has a busy nature. They benefit immensely from family play sessions.<br>  <br>  Staffordshire Bull Terrier<br>  Activity:   Due to their athletic nature, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier needs vigorous daily exercise. It is imperative that they be securely leashed or harnessed in all public outings such as walking, jogging, or hiking. They benefit from off-lead run time in a securely fenced yard and greatly enjoy play sessions with their family. The Staffordshire Bull Terrier will do okay in an apartment dwelling provided they are given sufficient exercise, companionship, and stimulation.<br>  <br>  American Water Spaniel<br>  Activity:   American Water Spaniels require an inordinate amount of physical exercise, and enjoys swimming and hunting. They have a tendency to roam, so daily jogging or walking must be done with the American Water Spaniel securely leashed. They benefit from play sessions such as Frisbee or a game of "fetch". The American Water Spaniel will do okay in an apartment provided they are given sufficient exercise and a securely fenced yard is available. They prefer a home in the country setting with room to run.<br>  <br>  Australian Shepherd<br>  Activity:   The Australian Shepherd requires an inordinate amount of exercise. A mere walk is not sufficient. They thrive on running, herding, playing, and all family activities. They are at their best when they are given a great deal of social interaction and a task to do. Australian Shepherds are not recommended for apartment dwelling. They are moderately active indoors and require a non-sedentary owner and a large securely fenced yard or safe open area.<br>  <br>  Beagle<br>  Activity:   The Beagle is fairly active and loves long and vigorous walks, as they are the outdoorsy type. Considering they have a very strong hunting instinct, this breed should always be kept on a leash or in a fenced in yard as he is bound to run off if something catches his interest. Two long daily walks are recommended, as this breed seems to have great stamina and be somewhat tireless. The Beagle responds best in a home with a large yard.<br>  <br>  Wirehaired Pointing Griffon<br>  Activity:   With a tremendous energy level, the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon needs an inordinate amount of exercise. In addition to being a fine hunting companion, this breed also enjoys jogging with their master and swimming as much as possible. They are not suited for apartment dwelling or for sedentary owners. The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon does best in a country setting where they have the opportunity to romp and run.<br>  <br>  Moderly active-30mintues or more daily<br>  Greyhound-actual do very well in apartment!-Lazy inside, but 2hours running recommended!<br>  Jack Russell Terrier<br>  Minature Pinscher<br>  West Highland White Terrier<br>  Soft-coated wheaten terrier<br>  Cairn Terrier<br>  Border Terrier<br>  <br>  Low energy<br>  English bulldog<br>  Boston Terrier-Less energetic then other terriers<br>  French Bulldog<br>  Pug<br>  French Bulldog|`|HDK10qYZaa	i have 2 pit bulls and they are the sweetest dogs i have ever owned the female wouldn't hurt a fly if she had to, and the male is 4 mon old and hes just a happy puppy lol.  they are loyal, smart, strong, loving protective,  love exorcise and are easy to train.|`|uoOfkE7Aaa	It all depends on how much experience you have with dogs. My breed is larger more rare breed BUT it is a dominant dog and requires a lot of training and an owner experienced with more dominant dogs. It is definitely not recommended for everyone.

They're miniature collies. <br>  <br>  They are VERY smart. 2 weeks after getting him, he was already potty trained and knew his place in the house.<br>  <br>  As for shedding, I honestly was very surprised at how little he shed. I was expecting a lot of shedding, since they are very fuzzy dogs..but surprisingly there isn't much. <br>  <br>  They are loyal and very very intelligent. And cute :)|`|c32aCqwqaa	great Pyrenees or my favorite an American bulldog|`|KPi5aU56aa	If you're looking for a lap dog that's easy to train and calm, then maybe you can get a Brischon Frise, or a Maltese (though they are very common). Chihahaus are slightly yappy, and quite delicate, but they make good lap dogs.<br>  <br>  If you're looking for a large dog, maybe a Greyhound or a labrador is good. Greyhounds have calm, peaceful personalities, and they don't bark, but "sing" beautifully. However, they'll need alot of training to reduce their predatory instincts, and you'll need to have alot of energy if you're going to exercise them (they're race dogs). Labradors are very loyal dogs, and highly obedient. They can be easily trained, and are usually used as sniffer dogs, and guide dogs. <br>  <br>  If you're looking for a med- sized dog, then a beagle is pretty good, they're reliable dogs but tend to be a bit stubborn. I have a staffy cross a cattledog, and possibly a terrier so he's going to be pretty big dog. Staffys are considered the most affectionate of all breeds, and they're medium in size. However, they have a fierce side, where they'll have a sudden desire to destroy when faced with another dog. Breeders have reduced this, but it's still noticeable sometimes. My dog doesn't do that, because he's a mix breed, he tends to shy away from other dogs.<br>  <br>  Go to your local library and look for a dog breed information book, i have books borrowed from my friend. You can also go and google "dog breeds" and you can find lists of dogs and what they're like. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|pJp06o1Qaa	i think u should first make a list or table of the qualities you like to have in a dog.<br>  for example: If you need a playful dog who should just roam near you then i recommend a pug/Poddle.<br>  2.If you need a sport dog who loves to swim and play then i recommend for you a:Labrador/Golden Retreiver/Bull dog.<br>  3.if you also want that apart from being obedient it should be a tough,energetic,fierceful then you opt for Great Dane/Mastiff/German Shepherd.|`|2VdJgenjaa	I have a beagle/lab/blue heeler/poodle.

My puppy just would NOT stop eating my older cat's food. We figured it was because the dog completely idolized the cat... followed it everywhere, always trying to 'play' with it (which irritated the cat to no end). It always wanted whatever the cat had; attention from us, food, toys, etc, and that was all (we fed them both exactly the same food, so it had nothing to do with taste). Eventually the cat just gave up and started eating out of the dog's bowl. <br>  <br>  They did have different bowls though (the dog's was metal, and the cat's was plastic) so maybe the dog just preferred plastic... but I think it was really just because he loved the cat.|`|YA3JJwE3aa	1st of all, cat food is NOT safe for dogs!

Cats require a lot more meat than dogs. This will probably give your dog diarrhea and he will be missing out on the veggies he needs that cats don't need.

You probably mean american staffordshire terriers and american pit bull terriers. Generally most are not registered and there are TONS of byb that breed these two particular breeds, most actually breed the two together, not knowing they are two seperate breeds. A large amount of byb means a surplus of dogs and they are more likely to end up in the shelter. And most do not spay or neuter their dogs which increases the amount of this dog breed as well as mixes.|`|Xtqs0Hxzaa	They buy them so they can look cool, then they realize the huge responsibility of owning a dog, and surrender it to a shelter.

You do not find too many Staffordshire Bull Terriers in shelters.   All the years of doing rescue (15) I have only come across two.  And a possible mix of of about 4.   <br>  <br>   If they are labled as Staffordshire Bull Terriers 9 out of 10 they are mislabled.  Shelters sometimes do this to stay away from the "Pit Bull" label and I do not approve of that.  It hurts the dogs more than it helps in the long run.<br>  There is a difference between the breeds mentioned. <br>  Staffordshire Bull Terriers are only 14-16 inches tall and weigh 23-40lbs.<br>  Amstaffs are 16-19 inches weigh 50-65lbs.  Give or take<br>  APBT's  18-22 inches some smaller weighing between 30-70lbs depending onlines. <br>  <br>  People get these breeds dump them cause of landlords, to hard to handle.  BSL!     Backyard breeders are breeding these dogs like they are going out of style & they are seeing dollar signs  and there are just not enough homes for them.<br>  <br>  edit since you are in London then they are SBT's....could be a mix of illegal APBT's.  And AmStaffs.   My friend lives in a country were APBT's are banned also but she has some that are mixes.|`|RDZGo6kQaa	I'm pretty sure I know why. Although there are many, many reasons people dump/abandon dogs in rescue shelters, I worked at a vet and know that although Staffys are wonderfully good-natured dogs with aot of love, they can be quite active, and on buying them alot of people don't realise this so when an unexcersized dog digs holes in the garden or chews a shoe to peices, they are blamed, rather then the owner. So the poor dog is given up. Or maybe this playful, happy dog didnt make a good guarddog?<br>  <br>  I hate alot of these people. Although I understand some people have a good reason to dump a dog, many are just ignorant and don't reaserch properly. I love Staffys, they are great dogs and conmpanions. It is horible that so many people love the idea of a litter of puppies so breed a dog, then most of the puppies aren't homed and end up in shelters or pet shops, whee unsold pups are also sent to shelters. Or if they are homed well, there are plenty of dogs already in the world who will go without those homes.|`|c8L6AybFaa	Hi, I own a staff and I believe most of them end up in shelters due to owner ignorance.People buy staffs and dont realise just how much time you have to put into this breed to make a good dog, staffs are naturally boisterous and playful they just need a good owner who is prepared to train them well from the start. I have had staffs for 20yrs and have never had any problems, mine have been brought up to be loving,loyal, family pets and are great with other dogs, kids etc. As in all breeds a dog learns from  its owner so it is no wonder these lovely dogs are persecuted for being dangerous when it is the owners fault for allowing them to become like that! Please dont judge all staffs by a few bad examples, mine are gorgeous (and well behaved) P.S. I'm in the UK and staffs ARE NOT "pit bulls" they are bull terriers!|`|ppUTZoq1aa	A lot of the ones owned by teen boys are just trying to look like tough guys.

You could mix them in with less fragrant greens, like escarole (cut it up, it's got a lot of strings which can make rabbits choke.), red, green leaf, or romaine lettuce.  My bun's favorite greens seem to be chicory and dandelion.  <br>  <br>  Good luck, if he doesn't eat for a few hours, I would bring him back to the vet.|`|AA10129150	Hay is a great source of fiber, timothy hay for older rabbits alfalfa for younger ones.

dl1OOOT8aa	The ones (pomchis) found in the animal shelters came from the pet stores, same quality but different prices. So there really is no point to go to a pet store when she can go to a shelter and save a dog, that originally came from a pet store.|`|QBFbvO21aa	They are expensive there for sure. But they do provide a dog well groomed with up to date shots and vaccines. Then again, they do want alot of info on her, like sometimes they might even want to come to her house to make sure it's safe and livable for the dog. <br>  I pretty much agree with you only because of the hassel it is to adopt a dog as to buying one from a breeder. (not saying anything against shelters, i love what they do, and they only want the best) but she can get a pomchi for around 350-500 bucks and sometimes more through her local newspaper or ads or even craigslist. Alot of breeders provide lower cost and also shots included. Start showing her some local ads! let her know it's safe to buy from a breeder as well. :]<br>  Also if she decides she wants just a chuihuahua, they run averagely around 100-300. alot cheaper than a pom!|`|ZYOJQdjyaa	A purebred Pomeranian or Chihuahua puppy can fetch up to $500.00 from a breeder, as can a PomChi. She is better off going to a shelter or calling rescue groups specific to the breed. Puppy mills are being busted all the time and all the purebreds and fashionable cross-breeds go to shelters in the end anyways.<br>  <br>  Are you certain she wants a dog and not a status symbol/toy?|`|065bc4464ecaa537a95fed387f27401faa	I own a pom and they are very expinsive I have seen them in pet stores for up to $1,200 bucks.  Also let me tell you a little about pet stores.  They buy these pets from breeders which supply these little guy's to them the problem is that the ones who breed for pet stores breed these poor little animals all the time they willl  inbreed these guys to be able to supply the pet store.  In return it make the pets from the pet stores have many medical problems such as blindness, seziures and many other problems.  As for the shelter, it is a great way to save a life and supply a pet that is in much need of home a good life I do recomend it highly.  Now on the other hand I have a pom actually two and I hate to admitte it but I did buy them both.  You are much better if you plan on buying to find a breeder, they usually guarntee the puppy for up to one year to insure that they will have no medical condition such as cancer blindness.  You can some times buy from a breeder for around $500.  Please understand  I did not buy my first my dad did and then the second one I got because I wanted to show him or I would have went to a shelter.  I have addopted from shelters as a mater of fact I addopted a alaskan malamute and she was ten times a better dog than my poms, she was so smart. Unfortuanly she died she was killed by a car which the guy come flying up the hill drunk.  Never the less your friend needs to check all options, there is rescue shelter for this breed.  Sh also needs to know that poms are alot of up keep and they are very fragil and loud.  She really needs to do her home work on this breed, they want you attion all the tiem and can be very jealous.  Yet I still love the breed.  Hope this helps|`|iwMpJ6p0aa	Well theirs nothing wrong with getting animals from the shelter at all. I got a Siamese cat from my local animal shelter. You do save a lot of my and a life. In fact when I went to look for another cat and found this siamese I adopted him and later on I found out from the workers from the animal shelter that the kitty would have been put to sleep that same afternoon. So in other words I got him right in time to save his life, literally.<br>  <br>  Animal shelter have full breed dogs as well, you just need to look.
RDfOZUgwaa	Grab it by the tail. You can hold anything up to a large rat like this and they're too bulky to flip up and bite you. A corn snake won't ever need anything larger than a jumbo mouse though.<br>  <br>  Make sure you don't dangle it in front of the snake though. You might get bitten or coiled by the snake instead. Just put it in the tank and let your snake find it on it's own. Also watch out as you move on to larger mice because if you're snake's not hungry and doesn't kill the mouse early on, the mouse can end up biting the snake which isn't really a threat to the snake's life but you don't want your pet getting hurt either way.<br>  <br>  Also if you're squeamish right now, use an oven mit till you see it's not dangerous.|`|zMMQVb3eaa	grab the tail and mice dont usually bite bro i used to feed my boas large mice and the ones to watch out for is if you ever get a snake you feed rabbits they will tear you up|`|TkJn9gO0aa	Purchase a good pair of hemostats, tongs, or giant tweezers and grab the mice by the tail with them.

D4ot0qLpaa	Whether the meds will be a problem for the fry depends on what kind of meds. Malachite Green is fairly toxic to fry; Methylene Blue is safer; others are a toss-up. The package might have an 800-number for the company on the back of it; you can try calling them to get specific info.<br>  <br>  You may not have good luck with the fry if your ammonia levels are high, anyway, regardles of the medication. You could try putting them into a large bowl until the tank is better, but that causes other problems like changing water and making sure you don't accidentally pour baby fish down the drain. Really, probably the best you can do for now is just to keep them separated from the adults (even the mother) so that they don't get eaten, and continue to do your water changes and treat as directed. (Make sure your new water is close in temperature to the old water, or at least room temperature, not cold - but you probably know that). You can try using the meds at half-dose, but then you might lose some of your adult fish. Mollies are fairly easy to breed, so chances are you'll get another opportunity!<br>  <br>  Livebearer fry are fairly large, comparatively speaking, so crumbled flakes should do fine for them. Just be careful not to leave a lot of extra food waste floating around the tank, and keep tabs on that ammonia level. You will need to keep them separated until they're too big to be eaten.<br>  <br>  And yes, that is massively overstocked for a new tank, but at least now you know about cycling the tank. :) And you're doing everything right so far to fix it. Good for you! Other things that might help:<br>  <br>  Add a tablespoon of aquarium salt, kosher salt, or sea salt to the water. Whenever you change half of the water, add another half-tablespoon. Don't use iodized table salt, but any non-iodized natural salt should be okay for the moment. It makes fish less susceptible to parasites like ich.<br>  <br>  If your ammonia is still high despite frequent changes, you could consider using a product like Amquel to contain it temporarily. But this isn't a long-term fix; it's a little like taking aspirin for a broken arm. It can help you keep fish alive during an emergency, but the REAL fix is the water changes and letting the tank cycles properly.<br>  <br>  To help you cycle faster, you could try adding healthy bacteria to your tank, either by adding a handful of gravel from someone else's well-established tank, if you trust that their tank is healthy, or by purchasing a good bacterial supplement at the pet store. <br>  <br>  Again, you really are doing just what you need to do, so far, and it sounds like you understand the concept just fine. You'll be a good fishkeeper. :) Just be patient, and don't kick yourself too hard for any losses - mistakes made out of ignorance are corrected by knowledge, and you're already on your way to becoming knowledgeable.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|kiRIUpigaa	take the mother out the fish breeder net / box and grind some of your fish food into a powder to feed the fry. or buy a tub of fry feed.<br>  <br>  over stocking your tank to early can cause new tank syndrom
tnEIPjccaa	The large syrian hamsters (including teddies) are best kept alone. It is what they naturally do when they get older. I would probably go back and get real hamster food. I'm sure the rat pellets would be fine for a while, but they may not contain all the nutrition for a hamster.|`|HW8ybM2Paa	They dont NEED a buddy but i think it would like it a lot if u brought its sissy home!!!!! Then it would have a little friend , a pal, a buddy!!!|`|7wRPYVU8aa	Hamsters don't necessarily need companions in general, but if they've been together for a long time, chances are that they like it and are used to it. They might even -need- each other. Separating them may be too big of a change for her. If she seems inactive or anti-social you probably should get her sister.<br>  <br>  If it were me, I wouldn't separate them...they've been together from birth.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: They do not need to be kept alone. I had two female hamsters that were caged together over 3 years...neither of them teddy's. Eventually one killed and ate the other. It's a hamster thing, not just a teddy thing. It can happen with any breed of hamster, and I still suggest you get the other.|`|ak9DrBSwaa	Syrians (Teddy Bears are long haired Syrians) need to live alone. They don't need, don't want and will kill a companion. It's only when they are really young that they can be kept together.  <br>  <br>  Please for your pet and her sisters safety do NOT go get the other one UNLESS you are keeping them in seperate cages. You do not even put Syrians together to play.<br>  <br>  Please don't give it a mirror - seeing another animal that they don't even want there that doesn't have the normal hamster smells is just likely to give your hamster a higher stress level and make it more likely to get sick.<br>  <br>  Rats and hamsters have different dietary needs. You should switch her to a hamster lab block (like Mazuri hamster diet) with a seed mix (like Nutriphase gold).|`|TUFoB5RMaa	No, teddy bear hamsters are solitary which means they live alone naturally - 1 per cage.|`|dvJYp7YAaa	They don't NEED a companion, especially teddies. <br>  <br>  But if you don't have the time EVERY DAY (around 4 hours), then you should def go get the other one.|`|KuEhEJHvaa	i would suggest not getting the sister because when they get older sometimes they fight and that is not good.

YRTYXfggaa	They should live as long as any other toy breed if they are healthy and properly cared for.  Health problems are greater in smaller bred dogs, ie: teacup.  Dental disease, collapsing tracheas, and knee problems are big issues, as well as liver shunts and blood sugar issues.|`|UxqSH3rOaa	First of all; did you know Teacup Yorkshire Terrier is not an actual breed? When you say Teacup Yorkie I hope you're referring to a small Yorkie. Yorkie's are a member of the toy group.<br>  If you didn't already know that Teacup Yorkie is not the proper thing to call them, read about it at this website: <a href="http://www.elvisyorkshireterrier.com/teacup-yorkie-information.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.elvisyorkshireterrier.com/tea...</a><br>  <br>  Okay, the life span of a healthy Yorkie is 12-15 years. Health issues often seen in the Yorkshire Terrier include bronchitis, lymphangiectasia, hepatic lipidosis, cataracts and keratitis sicca. Additionally, injection reactions (inflammation or hair loss at the site of an injection) are common. Yorkies often have a delicate digestive system, with vomiting or diarrhea resulting from consumption of foods outside of a regular diet. The relatively small size of the Yorkshire Terrier means that it usually has a poor tolerance for anesthesia. Additionally, a toy dog such as the Yorkie is more likely to be injured by falls, other dogs and owner clumsiness. Due to their small size, Yorkies may be endangered if kept in the house with an undiscerning or abusive person, especially a child.<br>  <br>  Read more about Yorkshire Terriers here: <a href="http://www.staryorkie.com/yt.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.staryorkie.com/yt.html</a>

I think you need to do a bit of background reading if you really care about fish.<br>  <br>  Fish don't really get obese, they can over-eat and then that leads to constipation, which leads to an internal bacterial infection, which leads to you having a dead fish. Don't overfeed!|`|e9gXZsKxaa	If you want them to grow fast feed them variety of foods.

AA12083992	The first thing to remember about house training a puppy is there ability to hold themselves is limited. A rule of thumb is they can hold "it" usually 1 hour for each month of age. 2 months old = 2 hours, 3 months old = 3 hours, etc. When your puppy wakes up (morning, nap, whatever) the pup has to go, right then! Take the pup out. When the pup eats or drinks, it has to go, take the pup out. After exercise (play), take the pup out. When the pup does it's thing outside praise it. A lot. Tell the pup how good, how smart it is.  You have to pay attention to the pups "looking for it's spot" behavior. When you see that behavior indoors, whisk the pup out. If you catch the pup in the act, simply tell it "NO!" and whisk it outside. If you find a puddle or pile after the fact, clean it up with an enzyme cleaner (pet food store) get a newspaper and hit.... yourself in the head and say "I should have been paying more attention." Daytime training they get pretty fast. Night time training is easier if you crate train the pup. Also remember the one hour/one month rule. You will have to get up through the night to take the pup out. Good luck
3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	Are they hair thin, white looking worms, that swim in an S shape?  If so, that's are just nematodes, harmless to the fish and humans.  They're actually pretty common, especially in planted tanks.  <br>  <br>  They weren't brought in with the fish so to speak, but they came along with the water.  Did you dump the pet store water into your tank when you added the fish?  If so, that's a big no no.  You always want to scoop or net the fish out and not add the pet store water.  Good way to transmit bacteria, parasites, snails, even algae into your tank that way.  <br>  <br>  Just do regular partial water changes with your gravel vacuum, 25% weekly for a normal stocked tank, and don't overfeed the fish.  Nematodes and other critters love over fed tanks, their numbers will increase dramatically in that case.  <br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|d51rpXduaa	You probaly did bring them in with the new fish, or you are over feeding the fish. These are small worms. I dont think they hurt the fish but they will increase in numbers and might make your fish tank smell. <br>  <br>  To get rid of them, reduce the amount of food you feed your fish and change the water frequently, by reducing the water at least 40-50% and adding new water. Also, make sure you give the gravel a good clean on the bottom of your fish tank.|`|3eMc9yf3aa	any pics.?|`|yf0tevyfaa	Maybe mosquito larvae? I know they look like worms when they're in the water?
alccyiawaa	Bad breath in pets usually means a problem with the cats gums or teeth. Most cats get some kind of dental disease during their lifetime due to the types of food we feed them, but there are things that you can do to help reduce the build up of plaque etc on your cats teeth, such as feeding raw chicken wings, if he can coz of his condition(never cooked, as cooked chicken bones are not safe for animals), you can even brush your cat's teeth with specially formulated cat toothpaste and toothbrushes but your cat may not accept this readily! <br>  <br>  Your vet will be able to identify the cause of your cat's bad breath and then treat it appropriately. Then you should begin to use strategies to prevent the problem in the future. Good luck!|`|AYfJWQuTaa	could be his teeth or gums are bad, gingivitis can do this, or maybe it's his diet?

5FzpxQRhaa	They are great names!<br>  <br>  If you spend some time, think about their personality and features and give a name that matches. If you want smart names, you can mix up words or just give it a adjective name. My cockatiels name is Cheeky. A dog I used to own long ago was called Coffie (Small, sweet, sometimes bitter attitude, black and brown) and his female pup was called Milk. Milk-coffie. Then we had another male pup, and it was all brown so we just named him Brown. Brown-Milk-Coffie. When I was 3 I had 2 dogs (both males) and we called one Lucky and the other Lotto. Lucky-Lotto.

g4lgt3Yvaa	Not all female turtles will lay "gravid" (unfertilized) eggs, but many do. Since you don't seem to be breeding your turtle, you have no need for a special nesting set-up. She will just "drop' them in the water or on the basking site and you can scoop them out with a minnow net and dispose of them.<br>  <br>  BTW. Gravid eggs will soon begin to decompose, so you want to remove them ASAP so as to avoid bacteria that is attracted to decomposing eggs. Actually, for the most part, bacteria initiates the decomposing process. The bacteria can contaminate your enclosure.|`|kTlfyTUVaa	if its female

If that filter is something like an Aquaclear, I would say it's not enough. If it's a large canister filter, maybe that will be ok. <br>  It also depend on how much live stock there is in your filter. The more you have the more filtration you'll need. <br>  <br>  Personnally, I always go with about 10X the volume per hours
I9SZa7PBaa	Good for you fostering a pregnant dog, it is a lot of work, but such a great reward to know you helped bring little ones into the world. My shitzu had 4 healthy puppies 2 months ago and it was my first time also, so I can completely understand what your going through. First off, do you, or the previous owner know how far along she is?.. Or how many she is having? Dogs have there puppies anywhere from 58-65 days.. Any sooner, or later, call or take her into the vet. They can be in labor for a while. Mine was from 10 at night until 8 the next morning when she had them. How you will tell is she will start to "nest" get blankets, scratch at the ground.. Not want to eat either. She will be very needy and want to be with you all the time also. I set up an area for my dog in the closet in my room next ti my bed. She kept wanting to go under my bed which would be hard for me to get to them, so I put blankets and things that were comfortable for her and that she was familiar with and kept the closet door open, just put something there so she couldn't get out. She will be scared, might bark or cry, but its better than her having them somewhere where you are unable to get to the pups. If its a safe place, away from people she should be fine. From there.. She will know for the most part what to do. Just help her. As each baby comes out, it will be in a sac, if the mom doesn't start to bite the sack off within a minute, help her with a warm wet rag so the puppy doesn't suffocate. Buy one of the nose suctions you can get for a baby, and suction carefully there little noses to make sure everything is out of there.. Then rock the puppy back and forth gently a couple times, belly in hand to help stimulate their breathing .Do this to each dog and make sure after that to have nice warm towels ready from the dryer.The reason I asked if you knew how many there were is because you can then no how many to expect. This would have had to be done by an xray. If you don't, just keep a close eye out, feel her tummy, and they generally come very close within eachother. The babies will drink milk for a good 5 6 weeks. Just milk, no water. The mom will not want to leave her little ones at all for the first few days, so make sure to have food and water next to her, and puppy pads so she can pee just incase she can't make it outside. The mom will clean the babies, there pee and poop.. You might see a few little poops that she misses, just make sure to wash the blankets and towels often, and try not to bring to many people around at first as it could scare the mom and she can get very protective of the little ones. Also, those babies will be taking a lot from the mom energy as well as eating wise. The mom will loose some wait while she is breastfeeding, I recommend feeding her an egg once a day (scrambled) as it has a lot of protein and will help keep her healthy. Try not to sell or give away the puppies until around 9 weeks. 8 at the minimum, the longer they are with there mom, the better dog they generally turn out to be!! Good luck! Let me know if u have any more questions! :)|`|akqzdLA8aa	It sounds like your about ready.  Just let it happen naturally but try to bond some with mother before she gives birth, you never know how a mom will reactive once her protective instincts kick in.  We always had a little hard plastic pool that we kept in the living room once the puppies could start moving around, easy clean up and they were confined with plenty of room until they could start getting out.  Good luck!|`|SndrZbn8aa	It sounds like you're really prepared. One thing that helped when my dog had her pups was a kiddie pool. I lined it with all their bedding and it kept the pups all in one spot with mom while keeping the floors clean. I had wanted her to give birth in the pool but she decided my closet was best... =/|`|5FzpxQRhaa	You've done your best and no you're not missing anything. I've never experienced something like you're about to, but only with cats.<br>  <br>  You don't have to do anything much. Just let mummy do the things. No need to clean the pups right after birth because the mother does it all.<br>  <br>  Good luck and hope Mummy dog and pups stay healthy =)|`|wZsKG8bPaa	Honestly, just let nature take its course.  Mom will know what to do.  Just keep an eye on things.|`|wjjvJhEpaa	Sounds like you have everything under control. Your main duty right now is to take care of the mother. She'll know what to do with her puppies. Also, there's usually one runt puppy and the mom may choose not to take care of it. It's just nature's way of preserving her species. You'll notice that the mother will lick each puppy's behind to stimulate bowl movements and such. She most likely won't do that to the runt and it will eventually stop eating. If you notice this and you really want to save the puppy, you can take a warm wash cloth and mimic a mother's tongue on it's belly and butt. I had to do this before and the little guy just loved it! And make sure it can get to a nipple because the other puppies will push it out of the way. If you can't get it to feed, you can purchase puppy milk stuff at any pet store and feed it will an eye dropper. Best of luck!|`|7e22a1b7de650843d2dd580cc4ddb41aaa	just love and  hugs
F32uPjAraa	Although most wobbegong species are unsuitable for home aquariums due to their large adult size (approaching 7 feet in length), this has not stopped some of these larger species from being commonly sold in the aquarium trade. However some aquarists have had success in keeping smaller species, such as the tasselled wobbegong and Ward's wobbegong. Small wobbegong species are "ideal" sharks for home aquarists to keep because they are the apropriate size and are sufficiently lethargic in lifestyle, enabling them to be accommodated within the limited space of home aquariams. Some aquarists, by contrast, see the lack of activity to be a drawback to keeping wobbegongs and prefer more active sharks. Wobbegongs are largely nocturnal and will consume tankmates, even rather large ones. Due to their low metabolisms, wobbegong species are not fed as often as other sharks and most do well on two feedings weekly. Underfed wobbegongs can be recognized by visually atrophied dorsal musculature.|`|SZOMVGBRaa	Yes they are kept as pets because they stay smaller than most sharks, they only grow about 90 inchs max lol. Your tank would need to be about 5000 gallons minimum, 10'0000 just to make it a happy home for it. Its care is saltwater obviously because its a shark and its gonna eat live food too which costs allot. Unless you where really skilled at saltwater keeping and where bored and have TONS of money to spend on setup. This is one fish that's best left in the wild. <br>  <br>  As far as where to buy one....

3IUMh4Igaa	First off, they come out at night. They prefer to stay in a cave the rest of the time, so don't worry about that. <br>  Second, after eating half a pinky, he is not going to eat for a while. That is perfectly normal. They are not an animal that eats everyday, or even every other day. And a pink is a really big meal for them. In the wile they eat small bug usually and still do not eat everyday. <br>  <br>  You are fine. Give him a few more days then try a few crickets.|`|cLhF7DM9aa	Emperor scorpions will feed when they're hungry, the way you have worded your question suggests you took half a pinky away from the scorp while it was eating it so it didn't go rotten overnight,?a pinky will not rot that quickly and I wouldn't suggest taking food from your emperor's mouth, he may have finished it and you wouldn't have had a problem with it going bad. Sometimes scorpions will go ages without eating and also go off food types that have annoyed them, for example, if you leave lots of un-eaten crickets in his enclosure  they may crawl over him and annoy him and he may stop eating them, you would have to use a different feeder item in future, try locusts. I don't like the viewing type products, I believe if the animal wants privacy it's for a reason and is its natural behaviour but each to their own and if it works for you that's fine, our emperors never seemed to drink but that doesn't mean they didn't and they get most of their water from their prey anyway.
F3LBgfvwaa	It's always possible for a cat to catch fleas. They can even catch fleas if you keep them inside all the time. But you can spray her with flea spray to prevent that from happening, so you could walk your cat and not have to worry. I let my cats outside on a leash and harness sometimes and they love the fresh air.|`|tatbIu54aa	Well there is always the chance that she will get fleas.<br>  But I would not worry about it.<br>  Cats NEED to go outside even if it's on a leash.<br>  My kitten(7 months)LOVE'S to go outside he would be SO sad if he could not go outside.<br>  I it was me I would let her out off a leash assuming that you have a place to let her out you can sit outside and watch her(make sure she is fixed before you let her out).<br>  But if you can't or don't want too let her out yes I think you should take her for walks.<br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|KPas0MBbaa	I don't see why you couldn't walk your cat.  However, she may not like it at first b/c it's not something you've been doing from the beginning.  Just like dogs, cats need to be trained to walk with a leash.  Also, it's not going to matter where you walk her, she could potentially pick up fleas (they can jump quite a distance).  Your best bet is to buy the flea and tick drops (found in pet stores, walmart, etc) to deter infestation (it's placed on the skin on the upper portion of the back in a straight line).  Whether she would have an allergic reaction isn't clear.  It depends on your pets physiology.  But, like other animals, she will scratch and bite herself to relieve the itching.|`|Ow2xyl9iaa	Your cat can catch flees being outside anywhere and she will carry them into the house and are hard to get ride of them once they are inside   the proper harness is ok.. and as long as there are no dogs around   but as i said she is safe being kept inside and free from harm and deseases and it sounds like she has stayed inside up tillnow  so i don,t think i would start now......the flees most certainly bit her and suck the blood from her little body.......and would itch her to death|`|YRTYXfggaa	Yes, I walk mine!  Just start out in the house first, cuz they don't tolorate the harness very well at first!  I let him get used to it first, then put the leash on and let him get used to that.  He loves to go outside now!  I'd rather do it that way then just let him roam the streets!
0B4plcLEaa	Hi, I have several pet quakers...and they are also one of the species I breed. I love working with them...they are awesome birds. You never know what is going to happen once a pair bonds, and starts to rear young. A lot of people breed their pets and they are fine. Make sure that you interact with them constantly, and you may not have any problems. I have a quaker bonded with a sunday conure (I know, it was not meant to happen...they picked each other so I allowed them to bunk together!  They cannot produce so as long as they are happy- I am happy.)  This quaker/ conure pair have been together for years, and they are very tightly bonded...but still bonded with me. But, these birds do not nest. That is where things get tricky. When birds mate and nest and begin to rear young they become hormonal and tempramental. Quakers nesting can be nasty little birds...even to their owners they adore. Often they are only concerned with keeping their eggs and babies away from anything potentially harmful. They may not want to be handled or have much to do with their owners while nesting.  This is not always the case, but my pairs go nuts when they nest. I have breeder friends that breed their pets, and they go back to pets when they are done raising young and everyone is happy. If you have a male and female...they should bond no matter if the female has bonded with your hubby. Once they reach sexual maturity and she realizes that your hubby is not her real boyfriend she will probably start to develop an attachment to the male. <br>  Quakers are colony nesters. Which means in the wild they nest in colonys of normally around 3 to 6 pairs. So your quakers are looking at each other and you and your husband as members of their flock. As long as you stay a daily part of their normal routine...you may never have a problem. They are not solitary creatures. They love their flock members. They are extremely intelligent and loyal little birds. They bond very well and very closley with their owners. They are my very favorite species to work with...I love what I do.  Their is nothing cuter than a baby quaker! <br>  I wouldn't put a box in with them until they are about 18 months old. Before that in a hen could cause egg-binding. Before 18 months in a male may be too soon for him to fertilize the eggs. I use standard cockatiel size nest boxes. Quakers lay between 3 and 8 eggs normally. Usually clutch size is around 5. They are prolific breeders and wonderful parents.|`|wF52XMxAaa	No telling.  You'll have to wait and see.  <br>  <br>  We have two amazons.  One thinks she's a person and wants to mate with Sandy.  The other thinks he's a bird and wants to mate with the first bird.  But she thinks he's a pervert for wanting to mate with her, because she's a person (she thinks) and he's a bird.<br>  <br>  If your two quakers do bond, you'll then have to see if they manage to remain good pets while breeding.  Many parrots don't, but some do.
Rx7wv4JLaa	You should really wait 48 hours after he got his shots and I'd wait until after his second set of shots<br>  <br>  The third set of shots help to boost his immune response but the first two are still effective and the second is a booster shot as well. The reason you wait 48 hours after getting the shots is so they have time to get into the system and start to work. <br>  <br>  I'm just assuming this is his first set of shots since in my area shots are given at 8, 12, 16 weeks. 4weeks apart. I hope you didn't get him at 6 weeks.<br>  <br>  Link on vaccines<br>  <a href="http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content.plx?P=A&S=0&C=0&A=524" rel="nofollow">http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content...</a>|`|AM7CgQ4daa	2 weeks after his last shot, as it takes 2 weeks for the full immunity to take affect.       Some dog diseases can remain in sand for up to a year, so it really is not worth chancing.<br>  If you live in a condo, do you have your own courtyard or balcony?  If so teach him to go outside, but I would not use a communal yard yet.|`|bCEMOIYkaa	I would avoid the dog parks until the series of vaccines is done. Also be sure you get the kennel cough vaccine also. Find one area outside for him to do his business and stick to that one area for now.  But really avoid the dog parks. Parvo is serious business and can live in the environment up to 6 months.|`|iwMpJ6p0aa	I take my 15 weeks old pekingese puppy once a week to the park and his barely going to have his 2nd set of vaccine, he already has his rabbies vaccine, when i got him i had to get him started on the vaccines again because the 1st owner didn't really do much for him|`|AA12393475	With puppies, you want to make sure your pup has all his vaccinations before you take him to the dog park.  As for your condo, I think you should be alright potty training him.|`|Qr7cTlFaaa	after his last set of vaccines|`|zphdun49aa	I think he should get a bortetella (sorry for spelling), because that is the one that will prevent him from getting diseases if you would ever put in a dog hotel. So unless he already has that shot i dont recommend the dog park.|`|qAHlZNWSaa	I'd skip the park until he 's fully vaccinated... but go ahead and take him outside to potty on a leash, but I wouldn't take him far from your yard at all... and no exploring just yet. When he's fully vaccinated it'll be fine. Better safe than sorry!|`|IJr0MR1Aaa	Until his vaccine series are completed, don't chance going anywhere that dogs frequent.  Dog parks are also potentially dangerous to young pups simply because they are small and vulnerable.  While many dogs are naturally protective of puppies, some are aggressive.  If you want to take him to socialize him, its better to do that in a more controlled setting.  If with adult or adolescent dogs, even small ones, make sure they are on a leash and under their owners control.  There are many places that puppy play groups are available.<br>  <br>  As for pottying him on a leash, he's not too young to learn how to walk on a leash, but potty him somewhere you know other dogs haven't been until his shots are complete.  If you have no place safe, toilet train him to paper, or pee pads, for now and retrain him to potty outside when his shots are complete.  Retraining to outdoors can be accomplished easier if you bring a piece of soiled paper to the place you want him to potty.  Anchor it with rocks and if possible leave for next time.|`|Okzc9Hl6aa	He can start going on walks as soon as he's had his second distemper/parvo shot (which should have been the 10 week one; generally he'll have gotten one at 8 weeks by the breeder or shelter- check his vet record to be sure). It's still important to avoid areas that are frequently trafficked by unvaccinated dogs (dog parks, pet supply stores, etc) until he's finished his last shots around 16 weeks, but the main two diseases that you need to worry about are parvo and distemper, and he'll have at least SOME protection from the first two vaccines. Not getting properly socialized is at least as dangerous as parvo and distemper- more dogs die in shelters where they ended up due to behavior problems (and socialization plays a MAJOR role in behavior) than from parvo and distemper combined.<br>  <br>  As for the dog park, I would wait until he's at least 6 months and past the main puppy fear periods. It's very important to socialize your puppy, and the dog park is definitely fun for a lot of dogs. However, at your pup's age, he's extremely impressionable, and one bad experience at the dog park could result in him disliking other dogs for LIFE. It's important to get him out and about and meeting as many FRIENDLY dogs as possible right now- I would save the dog park for when he's older. For now? Join a puppy kindergarden class, set up playdates with your friends' vaccinated dogs, and enjoy your baby, because they grow up fast!<br>  <br>  There are a lot of GREAT puppy training articles on <a href="http://dogstardaily.com/training/raising-puppy" rel="nofollow">http://dogstardaily.com/training/raising...</a> (no relation to me, I just like their site and chose my name independently :P) that you might enjoy.
ZDFw8o1Saa	I know, a lot of thoroughbred farms are not very personal with their horses.  If you had to ask me I'd say, Arrow.  You get it from the aim part of Aim High.  Think on it.  There are a bunch of other names you can get from Arrow too.<br>  <br>  Thoroughbredtrainin'girl|`|fyLOVaNiaa	just going to give you a list of stable names from yards ive been at for ideas :P i cant really think of any along the lines of abe <br>  Mocha, Diesel, Byron, Pepper, Sonny, Apache, Jake, Sooty, Bradley, Toffee, Slayney, Dylan, William, Spyder, Kestral, Bobby, Mcewan, Charlie, Arthur...sorry my minds gone blank :Px|`|u1HahCoqaa	Just call him Abel. Really, it is best not to change a horses name- it is compareable to getting a 7 year old child and changing its name from Sarah to Reyanne. It is also kinda a snub to the previous owners.<br>  <br>  The horse recognizes its name as Abe- so if you simply MUST change it, go with the closest name you can- like Abel.|`|y7H1V39Jaa	I see nothing wrong with Abe.
FCY3lwnoaa	The female is in heat and the male is trying to get to her.|`|u53ISZoXaa	he wants to do it, and she doesnt.  Who doesnt meow over that crap.  Turn the hose on them!|`|DqUf3LM8aa	The cats are about to have sexy times.  They have to have courtship first...they don't just jump in the sack.    This is the equivalent of phone calls, text messages, and facebook status updates.|`|knmxq1o4aa	they're discussing kitty politics. The discussions can get very heated|`|Ow2xyl9iaa	May be in heat they will do that.....or they are getting ready to fight  Perhaps it is a territoiral  thing|`|3OeE8kMQaa	Uh-oh, their plotting to take over... get your dogs...|`|KPas0MBbaa	Not much you can do.  This can last for a couple days to a couple weeks.  The faster the female gets pregnant to quieter your nights will be.  If they are still at it tomorrow, call the pound to pick them up.  If they have owners they'll be found (and those owners should learn to keep their cats inside during this phase or get them fixed), if not they will be spayed/neutered and adopted out if they aren't too wild.  If you don't want to do that I'd say give them a spray with the hose - but, they'll probably be back if one of the cats lives in that area.|`|MdOOdqnpaa	You will have to go down there and hose them down if you want them to stop. Personally I wouldn';t do it but its better then someone else going out there and harming anyone of them. The reason cats do that is becuase the male cat has barbs on his penis kind of like how their tongue looks, but these ones are more solid. So it is actually a little painful for a female cat, but that is nature. Its you call, but I would go out and do something that is gonna be less painful then what someone else might do to them. Good luck|`|QRRQB1Lraa	Man my cat (Johnson) did that a bit ago and it drove me nuts!!! I went outside grabbed his little *** and brought him inside. The next time that happened I just listened for a bit and yes it did drag on for well over an hour. They were out there fighting over the land he claimed (my house) till the other cat left "HIS" land.|`|9WzOlFMeaa	i hate that! theres a cat here that does the same! like we are asleep and the noise wakes us up! and it is VERY loud! i was telling my co-workers about that and they said that it means that they ARE in ~heat~... ewwww|`|2BOnGvBAaa	Darn it people...<br>  <br>  Have you not learned anything from Garfield and Heathcliff. Their just singing showtunes.<br>  <br>  Let them live man...|`|kZrZCPRMaa	There probably having sex<br>  and their both moaning from it look out<br>  your window!lol|`|et8gtvhGaa	communicating. seems they are friends.|`|4Um6yfhdaa	Deal with it.|`|XDYxhuVIaa	Theyre having sex.<br>  <br>  Cork the female cats butt to make them stop.
3sB49YNnaa	The way a pup will look is a function of the genetic make up of BOTH parents equally in a genetic sense.  Depending on the genetic make up of the individual parents, the pups may look more like one than another but genetically each parent contributes equally.  For example, if the father is pure breeding black and the mother is pure breeding red, the pups will all look black because black is dominant to red but each pup will be genetically black/red.  Breed one of these to a red and, on average, half the pups will be black and half will be red.<br>  <br>  Unless you know something about the rules of genetics in guinea pigs and have an idea of the parents genetic background, predicting is hard.|`|x3ly5oSdaa	Good Question :)<br>  <br>  My cousins used to have guinea pigs, think they were all girls, but pretty soon the had lots of babies. All the guinea pigs came out looking different from each other. I want a baby guinea pig :) Make sure you put the male in another cage or plastic bin for a couple of weeks after the babies are born or the father may kill or mate with mom afterwards, guinea pigs can become pregnant again shortly after birth. Have fun :)|`|VdeV0jUqaa	If youre cross breeding guinea pigs there is no sure fire way to tell exactly what the babies will turn out like. <br>  Sometimes, its all part of the fun of having pregnant guinea pigs- guessing what the babies are going to be like.<br>  If your guinea pig has an unusual colour pattern there is a good chance that it would not be inherited by her babies- if its unusual there is a good chance that it could be due to a recessive gene that the father would probably not carry. Breeding with a like-coloured or patterned guinea pig would increase the likelihood of the babies looking like the mother.|`|AA12309756	Interesting  Question, Although I know I can not answer this...lol..<br>  We have 4 albino guinea pigs... Started out with 2 that were both supposed to be girls.... Well one was one was not so they had a litter of babies....
YGqRSJjSaa	Probably an infection from earlier flea bites, my dog had the same problem, got some antibiotics and it cleared up very fast|`|386fa1284d4c180bfe964db1309fabd1aa	Could be another allergy - food and dust mites are both possibilities. Also, if she is not neutered then it could be a hormone problem. I'm sure the vet will be able to give better advice.
l6aRCUecaa	oh yeah my rabbit had that before, It is just patches of fur that comes off because she cleans herself with her front paws and so it will grow back, Good Luck with your bunny :)
bF3k1uBfaa	The best test for fleas is to comb the animal over a white sheet of paper.<br>  Normally little clumps of dirt will fall off. If you spray them with water, and they run red, your animal has fleas.<br>  <br>  This works because some of the dirt that falls onto the paper will be flea droppings, and the blood in the droppings will show on the paper when wet.<br>  <br>  Also, you can usually find fleas around the back of the ears, or on the tummy. If you look through your animal's fur, you should be able to spot fleas. They're no where near as small as you think.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, you may be lucky enough to have a very social bunny who just likes scratches. :-)|`|YRTYXfggaa	Did you look inside her ears?  She may have ear mites.  If it's brown or black gunk or specks, that may be the case!  She could possibly have an ear infection too if she scratches a lot.
YRTYXfggaa	They should be fine!  The problem with those kind of treats is that they don't digest very well, and they could cause an obstruction and make the dog sick.  I don't give my dogs any chew treats that aren't easily digestable.  Pig ears (gross, i know) are great!   There are also these things called "bully sticks" (don't ask what they are).  Both of these are easy to digest and can keep them busy for a while.|`|YuTFG3feaa	Chances are, since you stopped giving them the rawhide and nyla bones, whatever they have ingested of the nyla bones has passed through their system.  As far as the rawhide, if you haven't noticed any problems with their digestive tract (diarrhea, blood, in stool, loss of appetite, etc.) by now then you won't as long as you are no longer giving the rawhide to them.  I am totally against giving my dogs rawhide, but I have 4 small breed puppies that are teething on everything in the house, including the sheet rock, so I have been getting the real big rolled rawhide chews for them.  They are so big that they rarely ingest any if at all, it just turns into mush on the part they chew on and keeps them from causing further damage to house and furniture.
a984cQjKaa	you should stick your head in the anaconda's mouth.  for scientific research, of course.|`|alccyiawaa	what the hell lol<br>  <br>  i dont think you should put your cats any where near your anaconda|`|AA10129150	I think you won't be able to get them to breed, but maybe with a degree in genetics you can try and cross your cats with your anaconda. It would be interesting to see what you come up with. You should collect some DNA from your animals now because by the time you have gotten the degree and a lab to do your research your cats might not be around anymore.|`|hetZz4c1aa	It would not be scientific and is not possible.  So back to your science class.<br>  <br>  good luck!
kC8JHWVQaa	Great you can train this bird to use a litter box and eat from a dish as well so if this is safe for your bird by all means keep in the home it will love a high roost at nights  or it mat rest on the dog. Your home your rules LOL LOL.|`|46b18241eabac38c05136793eb0a4350aa	No you shouldn't keep a chicken inside your house as it isn't very hygienic for human beings to live together inside a house with a chicken. If this chicken doesn't get on with the other chickens outside then make a special pen for it & then you can get more of the same chickens if you wanted to.|`|pDv13gJwaa	yeah, get a big cage and enjoy|`|vUiUoamVaa	wonderful|`|fyrj50Braa	There's nothing stopping you as long as you don't mind the mess. People keep all kids of animals these days.
TnEtH1aUaa	maybe parvo my dog almost died from,it she had parvo,hookworms and round worms.|`|YuTFG3feaa	I am sooo sorry for your losses!  I have four puppies that I absolutely adore and would be devastated if I lost even one let alone all four!!!<br>  <br>  Was the vet unable to diagnose the problem?  If not they should have.  You definitely need to know if it was something contagious like parvo.  I hope the puppy that you had survive makes it.  If that one goes to within a day or two I would say it was likely parvo.  I hope that doesn't happen though, you have suffered more than your fair share of loss already!  LOL|`|mFQydvncaa	did the mom have parvo or any kind of deadly worms or diseases. I would have the mom looked at, especially if there is still a puppy feeding. You dont want them to also parish. Is mom current on her shots and healthy?<br>  <br>  im sorry for your loss! i hope the others stay with you|`|mzQhw8pLaa	I think this is because of poisoning!|`|065bc4464ecaa537a95fed387f27401faa	There are many thing that may have caused it, one thing could be mom laid on the puppies or there is some kind of disease that causes this problem.  I can't think of what it is called but it has to do with the mom's milk, some how it poisons them.  Were the puppies growing?  Also I have herd of mom not producing enough milk their for they are not getting enough to eat.  There are so many things it could be and I know it is heart breaking, I to had this happen once I ended up having to pull them from the mom a bottle feed them with this potion I know sounds crazy but worked great, they would not take the stuff you  get from vet and they were literally starving to death.  If it comes to that post it on here and i will send you the ingredients you need.  I am so sorry you are having to deal with this we get so attached so fast.   Good luck and keep us posted.|`|2BOnGvBAaa	OMG what did you do??????|`|bfe89b40e0344af279288338e469b235aa	herpes virus can wipe out an entire litter like that and now you get to worry your female could be a carrier and loose every litter henceforth the same way.....breeder near me spayed a high quality imported female because of this<br>  www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?cls=2...|`|0dda4d5d5420e22adc401448a90f4f83aa	Please learn from this and have your female spayed once the puppies have weaned.
rOMTKmjDaa	Go to dog beach in Del Mar or Coronado!|`|YuTFG3feaa	Most beaches also have leash laws.  Outside of your own yard I can't think of any where else other than where you go already.  You might try calling the Humane Society in your area.  They would probably have some suggestions for you.
Z9zzNYNCaa	Instead of LYING like the disgusting CROOK above says...you write in ***UNKNOWN***!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  & check out UKC|`|065bc4464ecaa537a95fed387f27401faa	DNA is a waste.  When you got to puppy the breeder should have provided you with all this information, you do need the mom and dads colors and registered name.  Usually you have to register them who the parents are registered with, they will also ask for markings on the dog.  Your best bet would be contact the breeder they can help you with every thing.  Good luck hope this helps.|`|nWlz56ubaa	Well, I think you would do best calling NKC and asking them if they require the registration names and numbers.  <br>  <br>  As far as testing him for DNA.....it's costly.   Several hundreds of dollars.  It depends on what vet you use for the testing, and what lab they use.<br>  <br>  Do you need to DNA test him for weight pulling?  I would say, if not, it's not worth the money.|`|3MxtpBelaa	o.k ive done this before, because my golden didn't come with papers, well i had no clue what her background was, so i put in random names, and filled the rest of it, took pics of her ect. well two days later, i relized i didn't put the pics in!!! so i was thinking they wouldn't send me the papers, well they did send the papers, my golden is a purebred, but they couldn't of known that, they didn't see her, they could of registered a lab mix under a golden retriever! what i'm saying is they will register anything with four legs and a check. all they want is your money. i would never go through them again, if i ever get a dog without papers ( shelter dog) its just not going to have papers.
e9gXZsKxaa	Sounds like you didn't cycle the tank....|`|LMc23g9Maa	We've had 2 gouramis in the past and they were real Bullies too.  NEVER again...|`|KPi5aU56aa	Do you use special water conditioners that remove harmful bacteria? IF you do, are you mixing it in properly? Maybe you're gourami is the cause, because my friend had a territorial fish and she kept it cooped up in one side of the tank. Her fish slowly all eventually died. They're could be a prevalent diesease in the water, that isn't visible. DO you also clean your fish tank often? think about these.|`|cdfyjkTYaa	When starting a new aquarium it is important that you "cycle" your tank. This prevents harmful buildup of ammonia and nitrites which will kill your fish if they spike too high. Their are many products that you can buy to speed up this process and it is advised you do it without fish in your tank...as you have witnessed firsthand.<br>  <br>  I suggest you visit some fish sites such as fishlore.com and read more about how to cycle your tank.|`|Qhdozm54aa	As a couple of other answerers have mentioned does your tank have a filter and is it cycled? I would strongly suggest that you test the water for pH, ammonia, nitrite and nitrate. If ammonia and/or nitrite is detectable then I would recommend carrying out several large water changes until both parameters read 0ppm/mg/l on the test charts. Almost 80% of fishkeeping problems are related to the water quality.<br>  <br>  The cycling process involves adding a source of ammonia (such as fish food or bottled household ammonia from a chemist or supermarket). After a few days the ammonia will start to be broken down over a period of a week or two into another harmful substance called nitrite, after another two to three weeks the nitrite (and any remaning ammonia) will be broken down into a less harmful substance called nitrate. This process can take several weeks to complete.
Um8osMNuaa	That should be big enough, but the bigger the better. They need room to stretch their wings, also room for lots of toys, helps to alleviate boredom and stop feather plucking.<br>  My cage is a little bigger than that, and my Grey loves it.|`|vMByDy1raa	That would be about the smallest I would get.   Remember the bigger the better.  They need enough room to be able to stretch out their wings and be able to flap them in the cage without touching any toys and you need room for two or three perches.  Wood, sandy, rope is what I use.  So they have a variety to stand on.  I also use a bungee rope (coil).  The more you leave him out the smaller the cage would be.  I leave mine out about 8 hours a day but my cage is a little larger than yours.   They are very curious and need toys to keep them busy while in the cage.|`|PmwX2VXOaa	Aloha. If your gray can stretch his/her wings, bigger is not always better. As most mid size parrots, they would much rather be out of the cage. I have 2 grays and 2 cages. both cages are 3x3x4. with a door large enough for them to get into it quickly. Sure you know what I mean. They would much rather be on top with some toys or climbing in and out and around the cage. Most parrots would rather be in their cages at night. It is there home. They feel protected in there and as you've noticed I'm sure, go in there to get away. SO. Ideally. if your bird stays in a cage, bigger is better. remember you need room for branches or excersize space. even if you leave the cage door open, a parrot will go in too feed and to sleep at night. and to eat. It's safer and they know that
c82ecbef231aced5c49891502424aad3aa	It's part of being in a pack and they do rub each others belly's and it helps them relax|`|16XpYCBmaa	My dog really likes that to. But my dogs favorite spot is right below her neck like between her arms. She always gets me to rub that area and if I stop she gets mad and takes her paw and puts it on my hand. It is so cute. I guess it just relaxes them and it feels good. :)|`|YRTYXfggaa	I think it's like us getting a back rub or massage!  Feels good and relaxes you.|`|S43JE69Uaa	cause it feels good I guess haha|`|SI46bZ8vaa	because it reminds them of sex|`|pRTh6SmTaa	It could be because it is a vulnerable spot for them, so the fact that you a. are bigger and stronger and b. aren't biting them there c. giving them delightful tummy rubs makes them humbled and joyful|`|d2191893763b20a6b077367a131978aaaa	...but some dogs do not like it.
5d8cda11147363f74448679f58829463aa	I've had more than one ferret several times and prefer it that way so they can interact when i'm working and such. Ferrets have ridiculously tough skin, what would easily tear through our skin doesn't phase these little guys. Mine would sometimes get in a tumble that looked like all out war, with huffs, squeals and lots of biting, but it's just play for them. I'd only get worried if it's constant and you notice one trying to bully the other all the time and really try to kill it. As for scruffing, it's not really effective as a guarantee stop biting, their still gonna bite and you won't hurt one this way because once again they have really tough skin, just don't start hitting their noses when you say it because you can damage their nose rather easily.|`|tSEUWOlnaa	teach  them by giving reinforcment that is when they keep playing together which is fine  and punsh them when they get pretty into it and bite each other pretty hard,|`|RHdq53LSaa	they are just playing..|`|TW4Xg7Kbaa	Tap them on the  nose and say no. Seemed to work for me.|`|QKUmQ5r7aa	never punish them it will only make them not trust you in fact the noises they are making are  play full noises the same that babies make some times they do get a bit rough and if one make's a loud noise and the other one doesn't stop,simply move the rougher of the two to their cage and keep it there for two mins then put it back to play|`|2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	Your ferrets are fine as long as there is no blood or poo during the encounters.<br>  <br>  As for disciplining, I have only used the scruff method. Yes, in the beginning they may try to bite you, but that quickly stops.  Also, if they struggle too much, reduce the support on their rear until they calm down.  I don't advise hitting or smacking them.  I've heard stories of people actually fracturing and breaking their nose by disciplining them like that.|`|Vcg2QuDWaa	I think you are making things worse by trying to punish them.  Separate them if necessary.  And let them play together on occasion.  Good Luck!!
HDK10qYZaa	yeah its possible! my neighbor has a german shepard jack RUSSELL mix  how they did it i dont know.|`|rLDf1gGGaa	Yes, actual it is possible a Maltese x in australia actual ending up getting a Doberman pregnant a few years ago! It actual made the news , with the resulting litter being Doberman x Maltese. The owners were shocked to say the least and yes there were 5 puppies!<br>  <br>  Also there was a Kelpie x Pomeranian at a animal shelter recently=It had the looks of the Kelpie, with the pomeranian coat!|`|16XpYCBmaa	I was wondering the same thing, my dog is a gsd/rotti mix and she was in heat and my moms dog a chi/cocker spaniel mix kept humping her. I never seen them actually tie. But I was just wondering this to. I would say no unless she was laying down but then I still don't really know if he could aim to the right direction. I am just really hoping nothing happen. But I would say yes if is possible if he is really trying hard enough.|`|YqskC1onaa	yes its possible when a ***** is on heat it last for about 2 weeks and at the just right time which is only a window of about 24 hours she will lay down to let a smaller dog in because she wants it as much as him believe me it happened to my german shepherd whos only contact with a male dog was an australian terrier and she got pregnant|`|KPi5aU56aa	Yep.<br>  <br>  My friend has a Pomeranian cross Dalmatian. Awkward, but true. it looks like a pomeranian with a big black spot on it.<br>  <br>  It's not impossible.|`|iGBA31qhaa	YES OF COURSE!!!!!<br>  BUT CHANCES OF SURVIVING AFTER BIRTH IS LOW.|`|2VdJgenjaa	We don't know how it was done but my friend has a GSD cross (mum) / chihuahua cross (dad). The vet thinks that the people who owned them must have helped some how. They were from an Aboriginal camp out of town.<br>  <br>  The result is Asha who looks like a very small GSD with huge pointy ears.|`|kCDDRFQCaa	yes, it is possible. Now you can have a Malti-Poo-Nard.|`|wjjvJhEpaa	Physically no.|`|WcQEqnM5aa	they sure can, only if he can reach.
AA12083992	Start with a vet, have them recommend a diet exercise program. Feed a quality, low cal food. Even a senior food, it has less fat. Feed according to the weight she should be, not the weight she is. No table scraps, no dog treats. If you must give treats make it carrot slices or apple slices. Even if she can exercise moderately for 5 minutes do it a few times a day. Again, start with a vet.|`|csPbzGHXaa	My dachshund had this problem.<br>  We have a fenced in backyard, so during the day we open our door and let her run in and out to chase squirrels.<br>  Also, take her to the vet and see what their opinion is.  Our vet gave us diet dog food, which really does work and the dog likes it.<br>  Try walking the dog the same distance until it gets used to it, and then gradually take the distance further, like you do with humans.  Don't take it on a 2 mile walk in one day.  It is small and will only be able to handle so much, but conditioning it may help too.|`|7j4IJi1Qaa	Alright first take it too your Vet.  See how much weight he thinks the dog should loose.  And what you should feed it, how much food, how much exercise a day, etc.  <br>  Don't give her any food besides her dog food.<br>  Give her a less amount of food.  <br>  And get her more exercise.  Take her on walks, play games with her.  Play fetch, etc.  Things that are fun so she will be more motivated to do them.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!<br>  Good Luck with your dog!|`|akqzdLA8aa	A lot of small indoor dogs don't get enough exercise.  Don't over-feed. Put down food and allow it there for a certain amount of time and then take it back up, she will eventually get use to a new feeding schedule and not be able to eat on demand.  Let her have time to run free and be a dog.  Teach her how to play with balls and fetch.  The weight will come off but you have to spend time with her and make sure she is enjoying life.  Good luck.|`|16XpYCBmaa	Just don't give it any table scraps, and put it on a diet of some kind and stick to it. And try to exercise it as much as possible. At first do small exercises and then increase it. The best thing to do it take it for walks.|`|GNq2rmrNaa	feed it very small amounts. you might feel bad but you will feel worse if you have to put it down for being too overweight.|`|wjjvJhEpaa	First of all, take her to the vet. They will be able to recommend the best diet for your dog. It's extremely important you get her weight down because overweight chihuahuas can break their backs by jumping off furniture. There's no way to fix it either so you would have to put her down if that were to happen. The vet will probably suggest NO people food, a specific type of dog food to lose weight, a controlled portion, and daily exercise. And stick to it! Putting her on a diet will be a lot harder for you than it is for her.

I paid $35 at the clinic the Humane Society referred me to for my cat to be spayed.  I don't know how the clinics handle it if the cat is in heat so you would have to ask when you call the clinic to make the appt.  LOL|`|aHfv3xcraa	Thats ridiculous!! $215?!!!

Usually it is because it makes him feel secure, and sometimes they do that if there has been some lack of security or lack of love in the household.  My brother's cat broke his leg when he was 3 or 4 months old and developed the nursing habit after that.  He was probably tramatized by the break of the leg and developed that habit as a result.  He grew out of the habit later on in his life and doesn't do it anymore.  So give it time and he will outgrow it.|`|SBEnrRZPaa	Is he new to the household? If so, he will eventually eat. The nursing is a comforting action that comes from his babyhood.

Oyb49z7Waa	Get a few clean 5 gallon buckets and save as much of the existing, cycled water from your tank as you can.  Use one or two of those to keep you fish in until you're finished (you could use an airpump and stone if you're going to take a while). Then just dump the old and replace it with the new, pre-washed substrate. Then just refill your tank with the cycled water and gently put your fish back into the tank. There will be plenty of bacteria left in your filter and on the other surfaces of your tank. Your fish will hardly know anything has happened.|`|tXxG2FrZaa	Better not to change the thing If u realy want to do Cycle the new substrate in any container and try to add the to your tank by removing the old one. nice to remove your for sometime and do the changes. So that it wouldn't disturb your fish health. New water as u know makes them bit sick. It leads mostly to death. From ur words it is known that u r well known of all this. Don't just get confused think for a while. It's your fish u better know well of your fish safety. All the best
eo0Uv7Wsaa	Read up as much as you can! Only you can truly know. They are VERY loud- yet very sweet and funny birds. You will need a bigger cage, new toys etc. All I can really say is read up on them, maybe go to a pet sotre and spend time with one and ask the person who is working a  lot of questions.|`|cdfyjkTYaa	A cockatoo is rather large bird, it will require lots of attention just like any other parrot like bird.  I suggest reading up on cockatoos specifically, and take into consideration the longterm commitment a cockatoo would be.  Also ask yourself if you can provide it with a comfortable living area?  There are many questions to ask yourself when getting a new bird...the biggest thing in my opnion is educating yourself as much as possible!

cqCb7et4aa	talk to the breeder who sold you the dog; it would be a bad idea to breed it with a close relative (so that breeder's other dogs are probably off-limits), but breeders keep in contact with each other and she will probably have a network of other breeders you could talk to.|`|JM4Uiunqaa	You adore her so you want to risk her life? What for? Would her puppies benefit the breed as a whole? Has she done spectactularly well in conformation showing? I'm not even going to go on from here because if the answer to those last two questions is "no" or "I don't know" then you have no business breeding her.|`|5rfnEQnGaa	You don't you read through the website below;
u1HahCoqaa	For dressage you want to look simple and refined- black tack for horse is the norm, and do not use a ribbon browband. Your horse should be very clean and well trimmed. Some people use browbands with "bling" on them, but that is quickly falling out of favor and some judges will mark you down for it- same thing goes for your spurs. For rider dress usually it is smooth black tall boots, (Or for the lower levels the same color smooth leather half chaps and paddock boots are acceptable) white or tan breeches, black (No pinstripes) show coat, white show shirt, (Goes beneath coat) Stock tie, Hairnet, black show helmet (Or regular one with a black velvet cover, or top hat for the highest levels, sometimes)  Black gloves, or, if your hands are PERFECTLY still, white gloves. That's for showing. If there are any fads in your area don't follow them- save yourself money and go for the classic look, it will always last. Although for fads, dressage is not nearly as bad as Hunter, and really this shouldn't be an issue.<br>  <br>  For hacking it truly doesn't really matter- although for safety you should still use appropriate (Not tennis or running shoes) foot wear, and a helmet. Ideally you will also be wearing breeches whenever you ride. Jeans are not only kinda tough on your saddle (and yourself) but they also are not nearly as flexible as breeches. Which might be fine for western, but most english riders just use breeches.<br>  <br>  .............And what do you mean by showing? There are so many different disceplines, and they all have different dress codes, really.|`|TNTFomKeaa	Dressage is white jodphurs/breeches and for showing you will need cream ones. You wear a black jacket for dressage and a dark blue one for showing. You can wear a stock with a pin for both, and a velvet covered riding hat to match your jacket. You should also wear dark gloves for both. White gloves are allowed for dressage but they show up every tiny movement of your hands so I wouldn't recommend them. That's the rider.<br>  For the horse, he shouldn't wear boots or bandages on his legs for dressage or showing. He should be braided - usually small top line braids with white tape around them for dressage and wider, sewn in braids for showing. Fashions vary though, so look to see what is being done in your area. The tail should be braided if it isn't pulled. (If you're showing in some breed classes and your horse has a full mane and tail you don't have to braid it). In dressage you use a white square saddle cloth and a plain bridle. At the lower levels you have to use a snaffle bit. You can't have a martingale. In showing you use either no numnah or a saddle shaped one that is as discrete and invisible as possible. You can use a snaffle, double bridle or pelham with two reins. Some classes expect you to have a plain bridle (working hunter, for example) whereas other classes allow a ribbon browband (show pony). If you're unsure, I would just stick to a plain bridle. Again, no martingale.<br>  Hacking is much more straightforward. As long as you're safe, you're fine. You should wear a hat, gloves and proper footwear. Your horse should wear a properly fitting saddle and bridle and boots if he needs them. If you're going on the roads, get as much reflective stuff as you can and cover yourselves in it. Use lights at night. It is far safer to be decked out like a Christmas tree than not visible enough.<br>  I hope that helps. Good luck for the show season!|`|RloOJ43haa	If you are confused, the way to find out the dress code for each type of event that you want to participate in is to read the rule book. It will tell you. You can download the rule books for nearly all types of events from the USEF web site. Each rule book will have a section devoted to dress and another devoted to saddlery.|`|3Tf9pXMuaa	(RIDER) dressage you can wear cream joddies  with a white shirt and tie with a black jacket with long  or short boots with joddie clips <br>  <br>  (HORSE) dressage plane black bridle  black or white saddle blanket  with main and tail plated <br>  <br>  (RIDER) show you can wear cream or banana  joddies  with a white shirt and tie with a black black or brown jacket   with short or long boots with joddie clips if short <br>  <br>  (HORSE) show black or white nam nar  with nice ribbon brow band  with plated main and tail  <br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|YHpePjb9aa	dressage: (rider) white/cream jodhs or breeches, long boots or short boots and chaps (or jodh boots with jodh clips depending on age) white shirt, tie or stock, generally a black jacket (doesnt matter so much for local level dressage as you can get away with a tweed or blue jacket aswell), plain coloured hat (navy or black), gloves if you need them. For the horse... you can use any type of numnah or saddle pad aslong as its not a bright of florescent colour (i like to use a white saddle pad and then a sheepskin half pad directly under the saddle), plain colour girth and plain coloured leather tack. The horse should be plaited and you shouldnt use boots. As for bits, you should stick to a simple snaffle/hanging snaffle/ dr bristol or double bridle (again... the lower level competitions aren't to worried about what bits you use but you might like to check first)<br>  <br>  Showing: Rider; Depending on what sort of class you are doing, then you should use a black or navy jacket for showing colours and a tweed jacket for natives/ mountain and moorland/ hunter classes..... but you are generally safe with a tweed as i tend to use mine for everything. Plain white or beige jodhs, long boots, white or pastel colours shirt and a tie, gloves, hat, show cane. For the horse, try to use a snug fitting numnah (no poly pads or saddle pads) so that the judge can't see anything under the saddle so she can see the horses movement easier, NO BOOTS!!! (if you do use them in the show ring the steward will probably tell you to take them off) plain leather saddle with a plain coloured numnah (try and keep colour coordinated) and a plain bridle. For mountain and moorland/native/hunter classes you should use a plain browband, but a ribbon brow band is acceptable in other classes, any type of bit (unless specified).<br>  <br>  So in general, anything is acceptable aslong as you are clean and tidy. Saddle pads are acceptable in the dressage ring, but not the show ring. Good Luck.
5FzpxQRhaa	Never stop loving it!<br>  <br>  It's a great thing to love your dog! I fell in love with my dog Coffie lol. He was always so nice to me and everytime after school he'd run to look for me. It's a great relationship with your dog. If your dog loves you too, you're at a great position. Keep the relationship going and it will make your life much easier =) [you could even train it!]<br>  <br>  I'm talking about relationship and love between owner and pet. But don't spend too much time with it, you can spoil it bad and if that does happen, it can be your worse day. Make sure you share your love with your family too lol. Because if you spend too much time with her/him, it can become aggressive to other people.

rLDf1gGGaa	No, because he has behaviour problems and a dog that has behavioural problems especial aggression toward other dogs SHOULD not be breed! The problem is by breeding him, your likely to pass the aggression with other dogs onto his littermates.<br>  <br>  Every year over 20 million animals end up in a shelter. Over 15 million of them are killed (euthanized is the nice term). Of those animals 61% of the dogs and 75% of the cats are killed. Very few of these are claimed and there are many more that die from disease, starvation, animal attacks and cars! Anyone who sees these facts must agree that not neutering an animal is contributing to mass cruelty and irresponsibility!<br>  <br>  Many people feel that neutering an animal is cruel, it isn’t. The fact is that it is actually much healthier and more beneficial to your animal. The terms related to this procedure "fixed" and "spayed" for the females ( Terms: "*****" for dogs or "Queen" for cats ) or "altered" for the male (Terms: "Dog" for canines or "Tom" for cats) are pretty negative but the procedure is a very loving and positive thing to do for your pet.<br>  <br>  Benefits to your pet after neutering mean that females have less chance of ovarian cancer or uterine infections if it is done before their first "heat". Each cycle they experience increases the chances of illness greatly, as much as ten times each! The other benefit is that you will not have to clean up the mess which happens during her cycle! The behavior benefits mean that your pooch or feline will be calmer and more reliable. You also won’t have to bat the male dogs or cats away and deal with the fence climbing, dirt digging, fence destroying mongrels or yowling, prowling, spraying and fighting tom cats!<br>  <br>  Neutering your pet is just as important! It takes only one escape to find a female and become a villain of pet overpopulation. One cat and her kits will produce over 420,000 cats in about seven years! Males who are neutered have less of a desire to roam, fight, mark and be destructive. They also have less problems with the prostate gland and testicular cancer. From a behavioral standpoint, neutered animals are more reliable, stable and have about sixty percent (60%) less problems than those left "intact."<br>  <br>  Veterinarians are now able to neuter animals at younger ages, some as early as two to four months of age! Traditionally, most veterinary offices will perform this procedure at six months. It is cheaper and easier to neuter the younger animals as many clinics will charge by weight<br>  <br>  Temperament<br>  Never breed any animal that has temperament problems. In particular, this has been the cause of the degeneration of many breed's general temperament: Doberman Pinschers, Rottweilers, and so on. If your animal is untrustworthy around people, overly aggressive to people, excitable, or is a fear-biter, do not breed it. If it is shy or submissive, don't breed it. Look for happy, confident and obedient animals, and consider carefully the particular temperament requirements for your dog's breed.<br>  <br>  There are a variety of tests to indicate a dog's temperament. Many of the working breeds have a temperament test (for example, the Doberman's WAC test) for their breed. AKC has a Canine Good Citizen test (open to all dogs) that gives some indication of the dog's temperament (and, yes, training). Therapy Dogs International and other Therapy Dog clubs have temperament testing that does try to separate out actual temperament from training. Obedience titles can be (but are not necessarily) an indication of good temperament.<br>  <br>  Here are some things that anyone who is thinking of taking this step has to consider:<br>  <br>  What is the dog's pedigree? This MUST ALWAYS be taken into consideration when breeding. Nightmares can and do happen when dogs are bred without checking out the history. Are the lines compatible? Will they double up on faults that could lead to severe problems on down the road? This becomes even more important when breeding chocolates because the genetics are trickier than with the other colors. I believe that when breeding chocolates you really want to stay away from having yellow in the lines. Yes, there are dogs out there that do have yellows but you are courting disaster if you are not very careful. You need to know if both your dog and any dog that you are breeding to could have yellow heritage and if so how far back. Ideally, a chocolate to chocolate breeding should not be done for more than 2 generations. Every other or every third breeding should be to a black that carries chocolate (called a Bc). You need to know the pedigrees involved so that you can advise the ***** owner as to the proper course to take.<br>  <br>  How old is the dog? No dog, either male or female should be bred prior to the age of 2 years. Has he been OFA'd, Penn-Hipped or Wind Morganed for Hips and elbows? No dog should ever be bred without these clearances. You mentioned that your dog's joints and hips have been certified and I can't tell you how glad I am to hear that. You did not mention whether they were OFA'd, Penn-Hipped or Wind Morganed or what joints you had done and what the ratings were. These are all very important. Did you have elbows done? What about shoulders and hocks? Are you forceful enough to insist that any ***** coming onto your property has the same clearances? Remember if anything shows up, the fault will probably be placed on your dog regardless of actual liability.<br>  <br>  Speaking of liability, we live in a sue happy society and it is not uncommon for law suits to be filed over health problems in dogs. Even if your dog is clear but the ***** he is bred to is not, you can both end up looking at a very expensive lawsuit. What do you know about the other puppies in your dog's litter? Just because your dog is certified free of CHD, etc, if there are a number of pups from his litter than do have problems, then the chances of your passing them on to subsequent generations is increased dramatically.<br>  <br>  Has he been CERF'd as well as being cleared of PRA through one of the current DNA tests? No dog should be bred without having yearly eye exams by an ACVO licensed vet. You mentioned that he has not had his eyes done so this is something that you would have to have taken care of if you decide to go ahead with any breeding. Once again lawsuits can be filed if a dog develops PRA or other eye disorders. Has he been checked for entropion or ectropion? Again you need to be able to enforce the rules with the ***** owners who come to your dog.<br>  <br>  Is his colour reconised by the AKC, even if he has show champion linage, many unusual colours are NOT reconised by the AKC.<br>  <br>  MYTH: But my dog (or cat) is so special, I want a puppy (or kitten) just like her.<br>  FACT: A dog or cat may be a great pet, but that doesn't mean her offspring will be a carbon copy. Professional animal breeders who follow generations of bloodlines can't guarantee they will get just what they want out of a particular litter. A pet owner's chances are even slimmer. In fact, an entire litter of puppies or kittens might receive all of a pet's (and her mate's) worst characteristics.<br>  <br>  Another thing Blue roan i think is a horse term, but i think your refering to Blue Mere which looks the same-colour alone DOESN'T mean a dog should be breed! Breeding responisbly, does the dog have Guaranteed sound temperment? No sign of aggression toward people or other animals? Also are you aware the Blue merle dogs have a deafness gene? Is he free of this genetic defect? BREEDING for colour is the WRONG way to go about breeding! Border Collie and Aussie shepherd have the Blue Mere colouring!<br>  <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Border_collie_blue_merle_879.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co...</a><br>  <br>  Just because he got fanastic linage doesn't mean your dog should be breed, breeding dogs should be about improving the breed & by breeding a dog with known dog aggression problems IS NOT improving the breed at all!<br>  <br>  A breeding dog should be perfect in nearly everyway<br>  Temperment, genetics and confirmation! Colour should be the least important factor but for breeds that have a known deafness gene, then this is important to consider, prior to breeding<br>  <br>  Be careful of local breeders-Alot of them are irresponisble and only breed for cutenes factor! I would kindly refuse and say he not suitable for breeding, due to his temperment with other dogs.|`|9kTejB0uaa	Bottom line - once you have allowed this boy to be used at stud, he won't be a 'family dog' any more.  He may be different of course, but my experience with stud dogs is once they have been introduced to this side of life, he will always have his mind on mating first, and you/family dog second.  In other words, unless you can provide him with a 'steady stream' of ladies, you will have one frustrated dog on your hands, and will most likely end up having to have him castrated in any case. <br>  <br>  Is he the only one from his particular breeding?  No siblings?  Is there truly a reason why he needs to be used to further his breeder's bloodline?  Or is this just all words?  I'd think, without knowing where you are, there were any number of good blue roan stud dogs out there already?<br>  <br>  I've just noticed your add on, re going ahead with neutering.  Probably the best decision.  Please know however, that the only certainty with neutering a male is he can't sire puppies.  The rest is down to luck really.  Neutering should never be seen as a substitute for training.<br>  <br>  But enjoy your lad - he sounds quite a character.  And I have a real soft spot for Blue Roans!!  I was going to find one, but decided they were just too go-go/noisy for me.  So I settled for a blue brindle Whippet!!|`|NlvghuIkaa	Reputable breeders don't ask for any random stud they like. A lot of research is put into the litters and this means titles. Obviously this spaniel has never seen his first show? Or even had his first health testing. Just because he was from a champion litter doesn't exactly mean that he is one himself.<br>  <br>  There is usually only one good quality pup in the litter and chances are, the breeder chose that pup to keep. The most responsible thing you can do in this situation is turn down her offer with a no. If you decide to breed him, aggressive issues are only bound to turn out worse. <br>  <br>  She doesn't sound like a good breeder in my eyes. I guess she is only there to add to the population of poorly bred and unwanted dogs.|`|eDySIDPQaa	No, the dog should not be bred, his temperament is not good....<br>  <br>  He may have papers, but no way he is a Champion and Titled out with the way you described him being with other dogs, one thing a Judge would put a dog out of the ring with his temperament......and doubt he would even make it to the ring, as they are watched before the show as well...any temperament problems and the dog and handler are out of the door...<br>  <br>  I have been to a lot of shows, and the way you are talking about this dog, barks, growls, he would not even hit the ring<br>  <br>  You should have him neutered and then take him to obedience classes to get him trained properly, and begin really socializing the dog before you get a lawsuit for him jumping another dog or even a kid with his attitude....<br>  <br>  and the person wanting to use him as a stud, is probably not a good breeder, you don't just pick a dog and say I want to stud him, a reputable breeder would ask for testing records and vet health certificates.<br>  <br>  I commend you on getting him neutered, it sounds like you really care for this dog and I think with training and socializing him really well, he is gonna make your family a great companion.<br>  <br>  Dogs that tend to be left alone alot or abused will get temperament problems, it is not their fault...<br>  <br>  so good luck, and hope all works out well for the family and your new best friend...and the neutering asap will help to settle him down, but will still need the training to get him under control|`|5WggUmJeaa	I think temperament should come top of anybodies list.<br>  Wasn't there a well used golden cocker stud some years ago that passed on a gene which gave many of his offspring 'cocker rage'<br>  Some will ignore a trait like this if confirmation is good.<br>  Well that type of attitude has taken many pedigree breeds down to there present state.|`|7e22a1b7de650843d2dd580cc4ddb41aaa	i would take you vets advice have him neutered. if he has been neglected and is nervous  then using him to breed could make it worse and . he will also be inclined to run of when bitches are on heat were you live|`|AA12279950	Well, given the cons you've listed along with the pros, I'd get him done.  It will make no difference to your life whether he's bred or not and he'd fit in far better with your family if he calmed down a little.|`|0dda4d5d5420e22adc401448a90f4f83aa	No.<br>  The only reason you should breed him would be if he was shown and a CH male. At 20 months he is not within breed-able age because he is too young to get the majority of health checks done.<br>  When breeding responsibly the owner of the male would bring the female into her home for the mating to take place - obviously you wouldn't have a clue how to do this.<br>  There is no reason to breed him, his temperament - as you've described - is not even a sound one. If he is that good a pup then one or more of his siblings will be shown and bred and be carrying on the line, there are way to many bad breedings going on.<br>  Also as you have just got him from a friend do you know any of his history? Did she transfer ownership of Kennel Club papers? A breeder knows a heck of a lot about their breed, their dog's bloodline, the breed standard etc.|`|7j4IJi1Qaa	A dog like that should not be bred.  With his temperament.  He will pass that on to the puppies.  And does he have papers?<br>  <br>  Don't breed unless your going to be a Reputable Breeder.  Which you even said so yourself that you don't know hardly anything about breeding.  Which means your not a Reputable Breeder.  <br>  I say get him Neutered!  It will calm him down, you won't have puppies with that temperament.  And then you won't contribute to the overpopulation of dogs.<br>  <br>  So get him neutered!  Please.|`|AA12083992	Please, please think long and hard about to breed or not to breed. Why? Why would you want to do this knowing there are millions of healthy dogs/pups killed in shelters every year because of not enough homes for all born? Why would you want to contribute to these huge numbers? You think you will find homes for all the pups, right? What about their pups? What about when those pups start having pups? Did you know one female and her offspring can produce 67,000 dogs in just 6 or 7 years? Did you know that only one dog in ten gets a permanent home? Why? Why do this?|`|Okzc9Hl6aa	No papers? What are his hip, eye, elbow, patella, thyroid, allergy, and heart test results? <br>  <br>  Don't have any of those? Don't breed him. An unusual coat is generally NOT an asset- usually it's one that is neat but incorrect for the breed (ie, a color pattern that isn't native to the breed and is evidence of a falsified pedigree somewhere in the packground; or something like too soft- a major fault in a working dog that needs protection from brush like a spaniel!) His attitude also sounds like one that I would not like to pass on. Drive is great, but aggression with other dogs should be extraordinarily uncommon in a working gundog. <br>  <br>  He sounds like a fun dog with a lot of drive, but I really would neuter him.|`|nFcl0BOsaa	"Excellent bloodline" means nothing when it comes to breeding. Since you can't show a dog with a temperament like that, there is no way he can win any titles himself. Even if he has already won titles and has been cleared of genetic hip, eye, elbow, etc.disorders, his temperament is still a problem. There is no telling if it's strictly inherited, or behavioral problems caused by the owner who didn't have time for him.   Leave the reproduction to dogs who are clearly breeding-quality.|`|oGVWdnHraa	By the sounds of his temprement, no you should not breed him, those bad traits could be passed onto any potential pups....which wouldnt be good.....and plus you shouldnt breed if you dont know what you are doing, even though you dont own the female, you are still accountable for the breeding and the welfare of the pups, so if you dont know what your doing, get him neutered :)|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	hes a family pet i would neuter him
cdfyjkTYaa	It could be a number of problems, one of my first questions is how big is your tank? From what i have read goldfish are big waste producers and if the tank is too small their water may be dirty.<br>  <br>  My next question is do you know about the nitrogen cycle? In a fish tank any waste from fish or leftover food causes ammonia in the water which is very harmful to your fish. the cycle creates bacteria that eat ammonia converting it to nitrites, and another bacteria turns the nitrites to nitrates that aren't as harmful to you fish.  If you changed all the water and washed the rocks you may have lost your cycle.  <br>  <br>  Finally, you may very well be overfeeding your fish, it is not healthy for them to eat too much, fish are scavengers, so when they find food they eat and eat until it kills them.  Feeding them 3 small meals a day is best.  Most food come with instructions on how much you should feed.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|X94VKR0Laa	It sounds to me like your fish has AIDS, if I where you, I would prepare for the worst. Think of the good times you had with your goldfish, and make its last days the best of its life. :)|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Your tank is much too small. Your fish are probably suffering from poor water quality. Oddly enough both laying on the bottom of the tank, and erratic behavior can be symptoms of poor water quality. <br>  <br>  Without a third dimension I can't figure volume, but your tank sounds smaller than a ten gallon, which is not suitable for two goldfish. It's always important to do your own research prior to purchasing a pet, rather than rely on the word of an associate.<br>  <br>  Depending on the type of goldfish:<br>  ~2 fancy goldfish require 30 gallons.<br>  -Fancy goldfish should grow 6-8 inches.<br>  ~2 common goldfish require 75 gallons.<br>  -Common goldfish should grow at least one foot.<br>  <br>  If you fish are not growing than they are not healthy. Test your water to see if ammonia, nitrites or nitrates are high.|`|0ac43e977a3e97e8837ae36373de95c0aa	Man needs vitamins so does fish. It can be the fish is sick. You cannot change the water just like that.They will die. Water not change for too long becomes acidic. On the other hand if you change the water then it become alkaline. Try putting some plants in the tank. The water temperature is also very important.

qaacatZzaa	It's because of the pheromones released by the female dog that gets the male dog excited. Perhaps also like when a woman smell good.<br>  <br>  The leg humping and or dogs humping each other like girl on girl or girl on boy is to show dominance over the other dog, basically making them submissive, i.e. to show them who the boss is, it's the alpha male (dog in this case) mentality. Not that the dogs are gay in anyway, their just showing dominance over the other dog.|`|VoQN7ADvaa	When female dogs are in heat, they're ovulating and are able to conceive puppies. Dogs don't have the same concept of sex that people have; for them it's mostly a primal instinct. They know that when the female is in heat, her egg can be fertilized.<br>  <br>  The humping of legs and the like is merely a form of self-gratification to the dog which they view as being completely different than sexual in nature.|`|TgNQAYyXaa	Male dogs can smell a female bit** on heat from quite a ways.  They will then find ways of digging or jumping 6 foot fences to be with the bit** on heat.  I suppose it would be like a pheremone to a dog, and it makes them "get jiggy"  with it.  <br>  <br>  A dogs sense of smell is incredible and they can sense a bit*h on heat from quite a distance.|`|o3xvqEkAaa	no, i'm like it all the time, woof.|`|ZdtebKIoaa	dunno,<br>  probs cos the hormones released in the smell of the girl dogs in heat gets them ready for it?<br>  humans and dolphins are the only species to mate for pleasure aswell.<br>  so the dogs do it only when its needed.if theres no chance of the girl dog getting pregnant,why bother/<br>  hope this helepd<br>  ^.^|`|uD9HMdLfaa	It's called primitive instinct... dog's smell the scent of bitches that are in heat which turns them on.

R60sy5yYaa	If you want to be able to let the pet roam around, I'd suggest a ferret (or better yet, two).<br>  <br>  The only real downside to a ferret is that they kind of stink, and are curious enough to get themselves in to trouble. The same goes for rats, though. Also, if you decide to get a cat down the line, they get along great together! Most are very good-natured and playful. They're definitely as amusing and intelligent as rats. They're litter box-trainable, and most likely already trained if you get them from a breeder or a pet store.<br>  <br>  You could consider a rabbit or guinea pig, too. From my experience they're not as friendly as ferrets, though. Not that they're bad pets, but ferrets seem to naturally like people.|`|j2M5aFfMaa	A chinese or a black person, both work very hard and don't think much although the black person is alot more violent though.|`|9PE8tV8vaa	I usggest a rabbit.

You can do so much more with a dog and I'm sure your girlfriend would be all over this idea!  Good luck!

3de088fb5bc7386da3a56759225eace4aa	Tesi scientifica:<br>  Sicuramente l'uovo visto che si tratta di una cellula.......<br>  <br>  Tesi religiosa (cattolica-cristiana):<br>  GENESI C.E.I. (1,24-25)<br>  24 Dio disse: ?La terra produca esseri viventi secondo la loro specie: bestiame, rettili e bestie selvatiche secondo la loro specie?. E così avvenne: 25 Dio fece le bestie selvatiche secondo la loro specie e il bestiame secondo la propria specie e tutti i rettili del suolo secondo la loro specie. E Dio vide che era cosa buona.<br>  <br>  Da queste parole si deduce che è nata prima la gallina, in quanto è stata creata<br>  <br>  Secondo la filosofia cinese:<br>  Si tratta del il mito di Pangu. Secondo questa spiegazione, offerta dai monaci Taoisti secoli dopo Lao Zi, l'universo nacque da un uovo cosmico. Una divinità, Pangu, nascendo da quell'uovo lo ruppe in due parti: quella superiore divenne il cielo e quella inferiore la terra. Man mano che la divinità crebbe le due parti dell'uovo si separarono sempre più e, quando Pangu morì, le parti del suo corpo divennero varie zone terrestri. <br>  Quindi due a uno per l'uovo<br>  <br>  Ainu<br>  La cosmologia del popolo Ainu constava di sei paradisi e sei inferni dove vivevano divinità, demoni e animali. I demoni si trovavano nel paradiso basso, le divinità minori vivevano tra le nuvole nel sommo paradiso viveva Kamui, la divinità creatrice, coi suoi servi<br>  <br>  DUE PARI<br>  <br>  APACHES:<br>  All'inizio non esisteva niente, solo il buio era ovunque. Improvvisamente dal buio emerse un sottile disco, giallo da un lato e bianco dall'altro, che appariva sospeso a mezz'aria. All'interno del disco siedeva un piccolo uomo barbuto, il Creatore, "Colui che vive al di sopra". Quando egli guardò nel buio infinito, la luce apparve in alto. Egli guardò in giù e divenne un mare di luce. A est, egli creò le strisce gialle dell'alba. Ad ovest, tinte di diversi colori apparvero ovunque. C'erano anche nubi di diversi colori. Egli creò anche tre altri dei: una piccola ragazza, un Dio Sole e un piccolo ragazzo. Poi creò i fenomeni celesti, i venti, la tarantola e la terra, in forma di una pallina marrone non più grande di un fagiolo, dal sudore dei quattro Dei mescolato nelle mani del Creatore. Il mondo fu espanso fino alla sua attuale forma dagli Dei che prendevano a calci la piccola palla marrone. Il Creatore disse al Vento di andare dentro alla sfera e di farla esplodere. La tarantola, il personaggio imbroglione del mito, tessette un filo nero e, attaccandolo alla sfera, scappò ad est tirandosi dietro il filo con tutta la sua forza. La Tarantola ripeté quest'azione con un filo blu, tirando questa volta verso sud, con un filo giallo verso l'ovest e con un filo bianco verso il nord. Con maestosi strattoni in ogni direzione, la sfera si allargò fino ad una grandezza non misurabile. Diventò la Terra! Non c'erano colline, montagne o fiumi, ma solo pianure soffici e prive di alberi. Allora il Creatore creò il resto degli esseri e delle bellezze della Terra<br>  <br>  3 a 2 per la gallina<br>   <br>  ABORIGENI AUSTRALIANI<br>  Nella cultura degli aborigeni australiani, la creazione del mondo svolge un ruolo fondamentale. La creazione risale al "tempo del sogno", in cui gigantesche creature totemiche attraversarono la Terra cantando di ciò che incontravano (rocce, pozze d'acqua, animali, piante) e così facendo portarono questi elementi alla creazione vera e propria<br>  <br>  4 a 2 per la Gallina<br>  <br>  BANTU<br>  La Terra non era altro che acqua e oscurità. Mbombo, il gigante bianco, governava questo caos. Un giorno egli sentì un fortissimo dolore allo stomaco e vomitò il sole, la luna e le stelle. Il sole splendeva perfidamente e l'acqua evaporò nelle nuvole. Gradualmente, apparvero delle colline asciutte. Mbombo vomitò di nuovo e questa volta vennero fuori gli alberi, gli animali, le persone e molte altre cose: la prima donna, il leopardo, l'aquila, l'incudine, la scimmia Fumu, il primo uomo, il firmamento, la medicina e la luce. Nchienge, la donna delle acque, viveva ad Est. Ella aveva un figlio, Woto, e una figlia, Labama. Woto fu il primo re dei Bakuba.<br>  <br>  Povero uovo 5 a 2 per la Gallina<br>  <br>  CHEROKEE<br>  In principio, c'era solo l'acqua. Tutti gli animali vivevano sopra di essa ed il cielo era sommerso. Erano tutti curiosi di sapere cosa ci fosse sotto l'acqua ed un giorno Dayuni'si, lo scarabeo acquatico, si offrì volontario per esplorare. Esplorò la superficie, ma non riuscì a trovare nessun terreno solido.<br>  <br>  6 a 2 ! ! ! ! <br>  <br>  Non so e non ho trovato altro, ma per il valore che può avere la serie storica devo asserire che è nata prima la Gallina ! ! ! ! ! ! !|`|0lY233dHaa	dio ha creato l′uomo e gli animali prima quindi mi viene da dire prima la gallina!!!|`|53895c3c419f23ad841454d718bc3ad1aa	Il Signore, oltre ad Adamo ed Eva in seguito creò anche gli animali ed anche questi li fece a coppia uno maschio e l'altro femmina. Per quanto riguarda la domanda per avere continuazione della specie nella gallina si forma l'uovo ma se questi non viene gallato non può nascere la gallina. Di conseguenza è nato prima la gallina e poi l'uovo fecondato che dà origine ad un nuovo animale.|`|DrgOhPJGaa	All'inizio Dio ha creato l'uovo, che era più rotondo di quanto sia adesso, ma Eva, scambiandolo per una mela, lo mangiò.<br>  Allora fu creata la gallina, con un deretano abbastanza stretto da far sì che l'uovo che avrebbe prodotto non somigliasse più alla mela.<br>  Morale:<br>  E' nato prima l'uovo che però non era l'uovo attuale.<br>  Poi è nata la gallina<br>  In seguito si è arrivati all'uovo attuale.<br>  Ah, dimenticavo ... tra il secondo e il terzo passaggio è stato creato il gallo.|`|N8RkoyvLaa	Semplice: è nato prima l'uovo. Come saprai, gli uccelli sono derivati dai rettili, che naturalmente deponevano le uova. E' probabile che una mutazione di DNA abbia prodotto la prima cellula di gallina. Quest'ultima, quindi, è il prodotto dell'evoluzione da un animale "non gallina".
V7AAba8Laa	There's a pretty good chance any of the eggs you get each day from your birds are fertilized, meaning they are viable and have the potential to be incubated and develop into chicks.  Until the egg is beginning to develop, it is often very difficult to tell what is what.<br>  <br>  First, if you plan on allowing hens to incubate their eggs and hatch chicks for you, you need to examine each egg.  Discard any that are oddly shaped (too conical, excessively large or small or otherwise misshapen).  Eggs that are less than perfect don't develop into healthy, thriving chicks.  <br>  <br>  Second, you do need to candle your eggs to check for double yolks.  Double yolked eggs hardly ever fertilize properly, and keeping them in a brood nest increases the chance that your brood will have a rotten egg break in it, contaminating the rest of your eggs.  Candling will also help you see if any eggs have tiny cracks in them that could let bacteria in - discard these as well.<br>  <br>  About a week after the start of incubation (brooding or the use of a commercial incubator), candle the remaining eggs again.  Each viable, developing egg should have a web of blood vessels within it, indicating the embryo is on its way to becoming a chick.  Eggs with a shadowy appearance, or the appearance of a thin "ring" within the egg or close to the narrow portion of the egg - indicates that either the egg was infertile or the embryo died within it.  Discard these eggs as well.<br>  <br>  Typically, if you collect your eggs every day, you'll never know the difference between what is fertilized and what is not.  If you do plan on trying to hatch out some chicks, you'll need to leave a few in a nest to see if one of your hens intends to go broody.  If you do not have a breed that is willing to brood its own eggs, a commercial incubator may be the only way to hatch chicks.<br>  <br>  Hope this answers your question!|`|kC8JHWVQaa	STONEFIE has it about all covered  have birds and have had peeps from them|`|VdeV0jUqaa	If you hold them up to the light you should be able to sort of see through the infertile ones, but the fertile ones will be much darker.<br>  If you are collecting the eggs every day, you shouldnt have a problem with fertile eggs, though.|`|ncWV2FwLaa	well wait till the time has past for the egg to hatch,about 2 weeks after and if no chick,then the egg is not fertile

8cikAYp3aa	set up a box for him, it needn't be large at all.  He doesn't need a litter box quite yet but will soon, a pie tin with litter works grand for little guys.  for comfort you can take a clean gym sock, fill it with rice and pop it in the microwave for 2-3 minutes.  It will hold its heat for 30 -40 minutes.  A stuffed animal can be a substitute mom for him as well.

Okzc9Hl6aa	Absolutely small dogs can eat raw! While you DO have to select food that their smaller jaws can manage (for example, wings and necks from chicken, rather than turkeys!) it's still very do-able. <br>  <br>  There are several models of raw feeding. RMB/BARF (Raw Meaty Bones / Bones And Raw Food) is probably the oldest and most well-known. It consists of giving your dog large meaty bones for the largest part of their diet. A certain portion of bones are consumed (these are smaller meaty bones :P) and a small portion of organ meat- some of these people feed vegetable mush or raw veggies as well. Other people use 'prey model' where they attempt to approximate the feeding of whole prey that most closely matches what wild dogs/wolves would eat. Because it's difficult to find whole prey animals (including feathers or fur) and it grosses some people out. Most typically, prey-model people use sources that typically cater to reptile owners and feed frozen rats, rabbits, quail or chicks. Others do 'frankenprey' where they attempt to assemble the approximate proportions of muscle meat, bone, and organ meat to match a prey animal. Lastly, you have a catch all 'everything else'. <br>  <br>  Two of the main controversies with raw feeding are the feeding of vegetables (Do dogs need them at all? Should they be raw? Cooked to mush? Ground? People disagree.) and supplements (in the form of multi-vitamens, fish oil, nutritional supplements like glucosamine, and so on). Some people feel that animal food sources alone (whether whole prey, frankenprey, or RMB) is sufficient, others feel that veggies are needed to approximate the partially digested stomach contents that wild dogs will eat from their prey, and to provide vitamins that are not highly present in animal protein.<br>  <br>  Lastly, there's the debate over 'balance over time'. It's important to feed a balanced diet- no one disputes that. Some people feel it's okay to have a menu that is balanced over the period of a month, others feel like it needs to be balanced over a shorter term of 3-5 days (that's the period of time that the body needs to excrete unneeded water-soluble vitamins and nutrients.) <br>  <br>  For most dogs, disease isn't a huge risk. Dogs iwth compromised immune systems of course, are a different story. Many dogs CAN have a few days of stomach upset when first changed over (others never have a problem, but many do take anywhere from a few days to a week to adjust). Just like your own food though, use basic food safety procedures (washing your hands, sanitizing cutting boards and knives after preparing raw meat on them) is important.<br>  <br>  I would recommend checking out the Yahoogroup called "Rawfeeding" and reading as many books as you can. It's important to have a balance of meat, bones and organ meat if you intend to ONLY feed meats. Don't be scared off by extremists in either direction- you'll find people who will say raw is dangerous and also people who will claim you're killing your pet if you DON'T feed raw. It's important to do it right, but it's not rocket science, either. Read everything you can and go from there. :)|`|JM4Uiunqaa	All dogs are descended from wolves, yours are just smaller wolves. ;) A raw diet of any flavor should be just that: RAW. Not boiled, not cooked, not dehydrated, just raw. As for which type of diet to feed, check out this site and see what you think: <a href="http://www.raw.com/myths" rel="nofollow">http://www.raw.com/myths</a><br>  <br>  Beef, chicken and lamb is a pretty good menu actually. I don't know why the first poster thinks "frenken prey" is gross*, it's really just a funny name for how prey model people feed. The goal is to feed 80% meat (muscle, skin, connective tissue), 10% bone, 10% organ (half that is liver). So I might feed a chicken quarter one day (high in bone), a boneless pork shoulder the next (no bone), some beed tongue another day and somewhere in there throw in a little liver and organs. The only things to avoid are large, weight baring bones of animals like cows, and stew bones. These have value only to your vet as chewing them often results in costly dental work for your dog. Your dog could get his bone intake from chicken, quail, rabbit, cornish game hens (really just little chickens), and fish. <br>  <br>  "is it safe for my babies? theyve never eaten raw before i dont want their stomach to hurt or for them to get some sort of a disease" The vast majority of raw fed dogs started on kibble. Your dogs will not get a disease from a properly fed raw diet. That means NO pre-made patties/tubes/tubs, no veggies and no grains. You may see some initial upset like loose stools, but you would see that switching kibble as well. You may want to join the yahoo raw feeding groups to get help from VERY experienced raw feeders who can help you with just about any problem you may encounter. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/RawChat/">http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/RawCh...</a><br>  <a href="http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/rawfeeding/">http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/rawfe...</a><br>  <br>  Several other people have recommended a dogster forum on raw feeding, but I am not a member, so I can't say how good it is. <br>  <br>  More info on raw feeding:<br>  <a href="http://www.rawfeddogs.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.rawfeddogs.net</a><br>  <a href="http://www.rawlearning.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.rawlearning.com</a><br>  <br>  * sorry, misread the first post.

9kceDOTraa	I apologize for the lack of intelligent responses you've gotten.<br>  <br>  First off, you need to list the size of your tank before talking about adding other Oscars and you should understand how Oscars are, not what everyone's listed either.<br>  <br>  Oscars are a large growing South American cichlid and they are monomorphic, meaning you can't visually tell gender, and they are also monogomous when bonding.  The bonding process is very physical and could result in the death of the potential mate, if either the male or female is not up to the test.  Once bonded, the male and female pair will mate for life.<br>  <br>  2 male Oscars however can be a problem if the tank is too small.  A single Oscar should be in no less then a 55 gallon tank, and a pair, if mating pair, needs at least a 90 gallon tank, if two males, at least 150.  Until you at least list the tank size, hard to say if another Oscar can be done.|`|syIp6d2Naa	I would never have 2 Oscars in the same tank they are territorial and will fight. I don't much care for them anyway they are the bullies of the fresh water fish. When I had fish I had 2 Bala-Sharks. they started off as being less than $5.00's each they were put in a 100 gal tank and fed live as well as flaked food. When I finally sold of all the fish and tanks the Balas were quite large and you have to be careful with them they are tank jumpers.The smallest opening in the lid of the tanks and they are out of the tank on the floor. I also had a 5 1/2" blue whale. he was just about 1 1/2 " when I got him. I also used to breed fish for the pet stores in the area. That was enough no more fish for me. way to much work.|`|vY0ScgeXaa	try to reorder it.|`|H0fXySX9aa	Like many aggressive fish, Oscars do well in large groups in large aquariums, but they'll quarrel if there are just a few of them. So it's best to keep one Oscar or many Oscars, but not just a few. In other words do not keep 2, 3, 4, or 5 Oscars in the same aquarium. Keep 1 or keep 6 or more<br>  <br>  this also depends on your size of tank you would need 125 gallons plus for multiple oscars|`|WA3Z2t9Yaa	yes you can|`|2YFfwdxWaa	OH NOES!!!@ WHY DID YOU LEAVE SUCH AN IMPORTANT AWARD IN A TANK.|`|Lf3wiwsNaa	You should be able to have several Oscars living together, as long as they are all about the same size.<br>  <br>  Oscars will eat live food including other Oscars, so make sure you only add fish that are similar in size as your current fish is.<br>  <br>  And be certain the "ick" problem is completely gone first.<br>  <br>  What did you mean by "beaten to death"? Was that caused by your surviving Oscar or by some weirdo person that did it?|`|9bz6EpoLaa	best for the 1 left to be single! it will kill the new one.
XI2iylR4aa	How old is he?  If he's older than four months, getting him neutered should definitely help with the litter box.  Here's a page about litter training:<br>  <a href="http://rabbit.org/faq/sections/litter.html" rel="nofollow">http://rabbit.org/faq/sections/litter.ht...</a><br>  <br>  He might be biting you because he doesn't like being picked up.  Dwarf rabbits in particular don't seem to like being picked up.  <br>  <br>  It's definitely awesome that he's eating from your hand, but nuts aren't the best thing to feed buns.  They're way too oily.  Corn is also really bad.  We like to feed our bun a sprig of dill, cilantro, or parsley (use parsley more sparingly than the others), because they can smell it, and it's not bad for them.  The only caveat is if your bun is under three months old, avoid giving vegetables.  Once he's three months, you can start to slowly introduce veggies.<br>  <br>  Anyway, he sounds like a normal rabbit.  I don't know if there's any way to slow them down.  I guess you should just enjoy the ride :)|`|bH1DYr5saa	Sounds normal to me. When your rabbit is in his hutch then there isn't really much else for him to do then sit in the corner. This is normal behaviour.<br>  Your rabbit running away from you is also normal! It used to take me ages to catch my rabbit to put back in his hutch. Feeding him tasty treats from your hand like you are doing is good - keep doing this when he is in the garden so he associates you approaching him means he gets treats rather then gets put away! Good Luck!
QjIhIFnPaa	Funny you ask this.<br>  <br>  The other day me and my boyfriend went to the Guide dog open day and there they had a stall with the greyhound adoptions.<br>  <br>  I feel in love.<br>  I never really thought much of the greyhounds, but after speaking to one of the men there for about half an hr and watching and patting them, i absouletely fell in love.<br>  <br>  I didn't realise how bad it was for the greyhounds...<br>  2-3 yrs racing, and then they get the boot :S<br>  <br>  They can be used as blood donors.... for like 2 yrs, sent to prisons to keep inmates company.<br>  <br>  And i never knew how very placid and gentle they actually were.<br>  <br>  It made me sad to think that so many greyhounds, would be put down it people do not take them in.<br>  <br>  After being there, i decided when i get my own place in the near future, i will DEF be adopting a few greyhounds!!!!|`|F69WYrtBaa	Yes, I'd have one as a dog, unless their a retired race dog. <br>  I've seen documentaries on how the breeders who breed grey hounds, starve them, then they put meat on a stick and drag it along so that the grey hound could run for it.<br>  <br>  Apparently that's why they need a nozzle on;<br>  <br>  Around my area, they are very rare. I've got two pit bulls, their apparently 'EVEN WORSE' (by the media) - but their such loving dogs.<br>  <br>  So, it's up to you, I think yeah sure go for your life, it doesn't matter what other people say/do, because it's your own choice and even if they say that they are aggressive, like pitbulls, I think that could as well be a myth !!|`|Okzc9Hl6aa	Absolutely, except for two things. <br>  <br>  Greyhounds- like other sighthounds- just plain aren't a good candidate for off-leash romps. I walk my dogs daily in a pasture that backs up to my property, and they're off leash. While I don't mind adding another leashed walk daily for the dog, it's not a great fit for my current crew. <br>  <br>  Secondly, they have very thin skin- with my nippy herding dogs, this could be a recipe for disaster. <br>  <br>  Otherwise? I think greyhounds are one of the best-kept secrets of the dog world. They're calm, with an energy level that's perfect for just about anyone- willing to go for as long a walk as you could want but also content to curl up on the sofa with you. While some aren't good with cats or small animals, many are, and the number of greyhound rescue groups means there's a dog to fit any household out there!|`|16xfUewoaa	YES absolutely! I love sight hounds,<br>  However, I live in the suburbs, so it might not be suitable to keep a grey hound, so I'd probably consider a whippet instead!<br>  =D|`|e2YQWIFSaa	YES!!! They are great, smart, and loyal breeds.  I would adopt one from old races that is being retired. They are the best!|`|bfe89b40e0344af279288338e469b235aa	well i have the similar whippet- sighthounds suit me to the toes
16xfUewoaa	whippet!!<br>  They are so cute and easy to take care of. I mean, sure, they need their bit of exercise. But really, they basically just love sitting on your lap or amongst your clothes and in your bed.<br>  Also, they don't malt or bark much at all!<br>  =)|`|e2YQWIFSaa	That all depends on the owner...If you are looking to adopt or buy one, try this site out to see what dog is best for you.  <a href="http://www.petnet.com.au/selectapet.asp?at=43" rel="nofollow">http://www.petnet.com.au/selectapet.asp?...</a>|`|aU2yDd8qaa	I love beagles..

They are tiny clowns so full of love and happiness. They get along wonderful with other dogs, cats, and children. Amazing family dogs or companion dogs. Very minimal shedding or barking. They don't need a back yard, just some good walks or a nice visit to a dog park to socialize with all their friends and  make some new ones.

Too cute!<br>  <br>  I'd get a good quality wet puppy food since she's a baby maltese Caesar's has one, although Caesar's isn't the best quality. A very small good quality puppy kibble. <br>  <br>  A water bowl and food bowl<br>  <br>  I'd stay away from collars and get a soft puppy harness and the tiniest retractable leash because it's hard for tiny puppies to pull the weight on the end of the retractable leashes. A regular normal leash. <br>  <br>  PUPPY PADS! Being a Maltese she is most likely trained to puppy pads. Start housebreaking right away, but beware of accidents! Give her the puppy pads if you are not going to crate her at night. <br>  <br>  PUPPY STAIRS!! Puppy stairs are the ultimate purchase. If she doesn't already know how to use them start training her too right away, she'll need them for her whole life to get up on your bed or even the couch. I have 4 sets of small dog stairs located in various places throughout my house. <br>  <br>  Teething toys!!! Get some good chew toys! Find stuff that makes noise! Dogs are fascinated by bells and squeaks, it's too cute! I also recommend buying some mini bagels, cutting them in fourths,  dipping them in water and putting them in the freezer. BEST TEETHING TOY EVER! <br>  <br>  Doggie bed! Give her a nice warm bed to curl up in at night. <br>  <br>  Crate. If you are planning on crate training her, highly recommended, at least at first. <br>  <br>  Puppy Shampoo. You never know when she is going to run through a puddle of mud or eat something gross and get diarrhea. Keep a good shampoo around, always. <br>  <br>  A set of good brushes. Don't forget that you will need to brush her A LOT to keep her hair nice and long. Start with a bristle brush to get her used to it, move to a slicker brush, and then end with a comb. I recommend getting a detangler also. <br>  <br>  I like to recommend this product called Angel Eyes. It's a supplement you put in their food that clears their tear stains. I asked my vet about it and my vet said it was perfectly fine but for whatever reason I can only find it online. If you don't like her tear stains, get the product! After 3 months my dogs eyes were spotless! <br>  <br>  You should name her Tatonka like my dog. It means Little Buffalo and you can get a lot of original and cute nicknames from it... Like Tonky, Tonka, Tata. It's just a fun name.|`|mzQhw8pLaa	She's too cute!You can give her pedigree,milk and some dog foods! and bread with milk will also be nice!She's so cuteeeeeee!!!!!.....You can name her Sabrina because sabrina means princess and she really looks like a princess!Or you can name her Sabrecia,Minnie!If you want more names and their meanings go to google and you'll find many more!|`|uXbl1Zbhaa	Get her some puppy food, maybe a couple of dog toys, and a doggie bed and a blanket.|`|7j4IJi1Qaa	Oh she's a really really cute puppy!  <br>  I'm not good at naming.  But something that matches her personality and her looks would be good.  You can look at baby name books and see if you can find anything.  <br>  Here's the things you will need<br>  <br>  1. Food Bowl<br>  2. Water Bowl<br>  3. Leash<br>  4. Collar or Harness<br>  5. Name Tag<br>  6.Crate<br>  7. Dog Food Container to store the dog food in<br>  8. Dog Food.  See what the people you buy her from are feeding her from and buy the same stuff.  <br>  9. Toys <br>  10. Chew bones, rawhide's something she can chew on.<br>  11. Brush, comb, shampoo, other grooming supplies<br>  12. Puppy Pads<br>  13. Treats for her.  Like if you start training her.  Things to help with training like a Clicker<br>  14. Dog Bed<br>  15.

Make an appointment for your Vet to get her a Check-Up and shots.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope I helped!<br>  Good Luck with your new cute puppy!<br>  <br>  P.S.  If I think of some more things I will add it.|`|YuTFG3feaa	I have 2 Maltese weighing at 3lbs10ounces and 4-3/4lbs.  The main things you will need immediately is the feeding bowls, collar, leash, a good quality small breed puppy food (I use Eukenuba), some natural treats for small breed dogs, some small toys (I had to start with cat toys like little cloth balls with bells, Kong brand toys are best), a bedding area or crate, depending on what method you plan on using to housebreak your puppy you may need pee pads, a good no tear shampoo (you will want to bathe your puppy at least once a week), comb and brush, tear stain remover, and maybe some ear cleaner and other misc items that you probably will end up needing somewhere down the line.

3c90e3772380f3b727bfbb0c621c8044aa	I own a Jack Russell Terrier and he is reg. with JRTCA and it needs to be of quality meaning the dog must match breed standard or at least very close. They won't do it if the tail is not docked. The trials are fun for the dogs. They make an under ground maze for the dog to go through. At the end of the maze is a caged rodent ie. rat, rabbit, mouse ect. I am not sure if the dog can be fixed because mine was registered before we got him fixed.It is a breed club so they are going to want the dog to look like the breed. I don't think their are any breed clubs that will allow it becouse it is needed in the breed!!!|`|6b50a4d706d1b59f2ece8c92ecb456d4aa	I would go to www.ask.com and type in your question,that is where I get a lot of good information|`|48a98f0f8f5bcc0d58051094b80b40acaa	Try the national breed club site!

Try not to worry too much, can be up to an hour between babies and like you said mum will lick them and nibble at cord to bring them round though she may need help doing this. <br>  Make sure they are latched on to a nipple as soon as possible to help them build up their strength. Keep an eye on their weight you should see rapid growth in the first few days.<br>  <br>  Don't be suprised if you get a still born... it happens. If it smells (not amniotic sac smell) it would have been dead a while if no smell rub its lungs and try clear any fluid from mouth and nose to see if it comes round. (If this does happen wrap still born in tissue and remove from mothers site for burial later)<br>  <br>  If all goes well you will have a load of happy pups suckling away, mother will need food an water near by like you said as she will be weak and over the next few weeks will propbably lose weight quite rapidly. <br>  Also if she is a first time mum she may squash them by accident or walk off with one attached to her! So always keep an eye out. This is going to be long and tiring few weeks for you!|`|q7GBzr6yaa	Prepare a room for the birth to occur. This room should have an impervious floor that makes cleaning easy. It should not be drafty and should be in a quite area of the home. Prepare a bed for the dog that is lined with towels or unused clothes and get her used to using it. If the mother won’t stay in it, you can encourage her to by petting her and giving her small food snacks. Lead her to the designated nursing area when labor begins. If she has her puppies outside of the pre-assigned area, let her. When she has completed the delivery, move them all into the designated bed. Many dogs become very clingy when labor begins and want you to stay with them at all times. They try to follow you when you leave the room. You will probably need to spend some time with this type of dog to comfort her. After the birth of the first few puppies, the mother usually is preoccupied with her pups and not as dependent on your presence. Other bitches will try to get away from you and hide. Give her the space she needs, but keep checking in on her regularly. It is quite possible that you will miss the birth process entirely. You might wake up one morning or return from work only to find you have a brand new litter of offspring contentedly nursing on their mom. If your nursery room is not warm enough, you can warmer it by wrapping a heating pad in a towel, setting it on "low," and placing it under one half of the nursery bed. This allows the mother and puppies to move away from the heat source if they choose to. Wrap duct tape around the heating pad cord because puppies tend to chew on cords. When labor is eminent the mother’s appetite will disappear. By their third or fourth week the puppies should be starting to eat on their own. Encourage them to eat solids by themselves in order to remove the stress of milk production from the mother. By six to eight weeks the puppies should be fully weaned so the mother’s food can revert back to the amount she ate prior to pregnancy. When you wean the puppies help the mother’s milk supply to dry up. Do this by withholding food and only offering her half the water she normally consumes. The following day, give her only a quarter of her pre-pregnancy food supply and one half the water. From the second day on give her all the water she wants. Slowly increase her food over five days until it is back to her prepregnancy level. If she has lost weight during the pregnancy adjust her food intake upward to make up the lost weight.|`|UmhWxs1laa	A few more things to have:<br>  <br>  A person experienced in whelping dogs to help you and stay until the litter is here.  Contact your local kennel club (www.infodog.com and look up shows -- they are sponsored by a kennel club, google that kennel club and explain the problem)<br>  <br>  A reproductive vet who can do a c-section if necessary and will give you guidance on the phone -- day or night -- if you need it.<br>  <br>  A whelping box - get a plastic kiddie pool -- seriously, they work great and are easy to clean.<br>  <br>  A reflector and light bulb from home depot -- the kind that workmen use that clip onto things.  Have this about 4 feet (no closer to one end of the whelping box to make that a bit warmer than the rest if a pup wants to warm up.<br>  <br>  A humidifier if you live in a dry area <br>  <br>  I usually surround the whelping box with an x-pen (puppy play pen) about 4-5 feet high.  I drape a sheet over the x-pen to make a "cave" for mom.  Use clothespins to secure.  Under this the reflector light is clipped on the top at one end, and have the humidifier going so that the moist air gets sent under the sheet.<br>  <br>  Now get a kitchen digital scale and several colors of yarn.  Mark each pup (if you can't tell them apart by markings) with little collars of yarn.  Weigh each pup twice a day to ensure they are gaining weight. If they don't gain on a weighing, give them a bit of "stat" (can be bought at pet supply catalogues on the web).  A drop or two.<br>  <br>  If weight does not pick up on next weighing -- off to the vet.  Hopefully an experienced one with neonates.  If not an experienced vet with them, tell them to do "sub q fluids" on the pup and teach you how.  This isn't always the answer, but plenty of times it is and regardless of the issue it's worth a shot to get the pup re-hydrated.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|QCkRRqVwaa	There's nothing I can say here that the animal activists and extremists won't bash. [or at least just thumbs down] But I have had literally thousands of dogs and a lot of them had puppies, and all you really have to do is feed the mother healthy healthy food and plenty of water, give her a warm, dry place to have puppies, and watch her to make sure everything goes smoothly. <br>  I have not had to help any of mine with the sac, but that is one of the things I watched for. I have had to help goats, and I did that by having one of those baby aspirators* to help get them breathing.

They make a big mess on whatever they're on. Don't try to clean it with any chemicals, but wipe it up as good as possible and put fresh towels or blankets down. I would wait and let her rest for a while, though. Maybe until she came out to get food or water.<br>  <br>  I'm not about to explain to everyone why I've had a lot of dogs. They don't care, no matter what I say they'll still think they are better people than me.

The hid behind strong trees and usually stay lower to the ground during a storm.  We had a tornado hit out back yard threw the swing set on the roof but didn't touch a child's picnic table out back.  They have a natural instinct on how to survive.|`|EJpiaCMQaa	When it's windy, birds will seek refuge from the wind in the hollow cavities of trees.

AA12083992	Our pets need quality  food. Read the ingredients list and learn what the stuff on there is and what it does (or does not do) to/for our pets. A quick pet food 101. If the pet food contains corn/corn products or by products it is a poor quality food. Corn is a filler that can trigger skin problems. (allergies, skin problems, itching and excessive shedding) By products is anything from an animal not fit for human consumption, including cancerous tissue. Do not pay attention to advertising, they all say there food is great. "Vet approved" means they have a vet on staff to approve their product. In other words, someone paid to approve it. Same with foods most vets recommend. Salesmen "gift" vets then the vet recommends the food. Most vets are not nutritionists! Quality foods have meat as the first ingredient Wellness, Solid Gold, Innova and Merrick are a few of the best brands available.

If you search Purina and Science Diet on that site, they have NO pro's. All they have is cons. You definitely don't want to be feeding your pup that. The problem with that crappy food is that it has grain. Corn is especially difficult for dogs to digest. Some are also allergic to it. The next issue is the by-products. In order to get the by-product (lets say chicken), the parts used in the food weren't good enough to use in human food or other pet food. The by-products are usually the necks, feet, intestines, etc. Ick. Also, soybean meal is used. It is so low in protein and it can cause allergies. Some other issues are the fillers and artificial flavors used. <br>  <br>  I don't know what food you have in Germany, so you will just have to look through that site and read reviews, and just do some research.

AA10729271	Well, diarrhea is a sign that the body is not absorbing enough liquid so you need to get more liquids into her. it is a common symptom of many illnesses older animals are prone to. You should probably take her in for a check up, just to rule out that she doesn't have a blockage or a tumour (also common in older animals). But if it turns out to just be a symptom of old age there are some things you can try.<br>  <br>  I have cared for several old and ailing pets, and have noticed their stomachs due tend to get very sensitive. Our old dog Miss.K is at least 20 years old (we did not get her until she was full grown so are not quite sure about her exact age) is very particular. she had all her teeth removed so we make her homemade dogfood. but after she had her teeth out for several weeks we had to make her a beefshake, which was dogfood pureed with a rich homemade broth. you could try the same, it will make the food easier to eat since she will be able to lap it up and also get more liquidd at the same time.<br>  <br>  get some broth bones, sometimes butchers will actually give them away. boil them on low for several hours and then chill the broth. remove the layer of fat. add a little broth to the catfood you use to thin it so that it can be lapped up. <br>  <br>  Also give her a little catnip, did you know that as a herb it is often used in teas to sooth stomachs, it sometimes give it to my dogs to and it seems to sooth upset stomachs.|`|mzQhw8pLaa	So sad but don't worry go to google and you can find some informations!
4c1e07d9ba0c2d099d9db46ee34af35faa	I would ask your friend about cost of grazing land etc. as these vary enormously around the country. It will depend whereabouts in Essex you live. If you get something like a Shetland, then the costs are small - they need next to nothing, just some hay in the winter - but very little, a section a day. Hay prices vary enormously from year-to-year, but I think about ￡5/bale in most areas for people buying it in small quantities over the past winter. A healthy Shetland will live out all year with no need for rugs or stabling, so that would cut down costs - BUT you have to know about restricting their weight, they can't cope with rich grassland, as they get too fat and very often get laminitis which is very serious, so you need somewhere with very rough grazing or you might have to restrict them to short bouts on the grass, in which case you will need other facilities a stable, or hard standing for them to be turned out on.<br>  <br>  Vet costs depend partly on looking after them well and of course on no accidents. 1 visit per year for tetanus and flu jabs should be enough. The call-out fee is around ￡30 for most vets and for a booster jab, I think about ￡40. If the pony needs to start jabs from scratch it's more expensive the first time round.<br>  <br>  If it is not a riding pony, all you will need is a headcollar ￡10+ and a grooming kit - brushes start at around ￡2-3 each and a basic first-aid kit which will cost about ￡30-40 to put together.<br>  <br>  Pony will need to be wormed - this may be 6-8 times per year to include all worms and depends on the wormer used and whether there are lots of other ponies on the same grazing. If you are at a livery yard you may have to follow their worming programme. Wormers are approx. ￡15 per tube, but vary.<br>  <br>  Feet will need to be seen to, average ￡20 for a trim if the pony doesn't need shoes. Sheltands may last 8 weeks or more between visits, but if they have a past history of laminitis, as many do, then more regular attention to damaged hooves may be required.<br>  <br>  Finally you should have insurance which will cover accident and injury caused by your pony, vet bills. The cost will depend on the value of the animal but will come into the lowest class if it is not being ridden, possibly as little as ￡15/month but it depends.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't go for a Falabella - they are a specialist breed, often have health problems and require more experience than you have, in my opinion. If you want a Shetland as a pet that's fine but you MUST be careful with their weight and grazing. If you are going to keep it at a yard with others then one will be fine. If you plan to rent your own plot then you will need two.<br>  <br>  In sourcing your ponies I think it is likely that rescue charities are unlikely to let you have any, as you are definitely novices - they spend a fortune rehabilitating their animals and usually only allow them to go to experienced owners. You could have a look round the sales instead and see if you can outbid the meat men - older unregistered Shetlands often end up going that route, or I have put a meat farm rescue site below - it's a bit more costly getting your animals over, but it is genuine rescue and if you have some knowledgeable friends small ponies tend to settle after a while, although I admit it might be a gamble for the first time owner.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|Ov5nCTUxaa	my horse costs me ￡65 a week to keep  not including vet bills.<br>  <br>   a shetlland or small pony  is likly to cost around 30 to 40. speak to your local riding school, they may be able to offer such a shetland or small pony on loan and its often cheaper than owning one.<br>  <br>   its possible to rent a small paddock but also remember the pony will need shelter to, in addition feed, vets bill and farrier bill. tack could be bought second hand.|`|alccyiawaa	Hi!<br>  <br>  first things first,<br>  if your getting a pony, you need somewhere to put it.<br>  <br>  if you dont have land of your own, you will need to agist at somewhere like a riding school or a agistment place or even a friends house.<br>  the cost of having your pony there each week would be inbetween $50-$100. the cheaper places usually dont rug or feed your horses and the dearer places rug/feed your horse for you.<br>  <br>  if the place the feeds your horse, the agistment fee includes the feed.<br>  but if you have to supply your own, since you are only getting a pony you will only need to feed it hay if it fat. <br>  Hay costs about $10-$25 a bale. the cheaper is just grass hay that you might but privately, but the dearer hay is usually lucern hay which you would buy at a produce place.<br>  <br>  if your pony gets hurt or needs medication, the vet bill can come up pretty high. recently my horse cut his leg on a fence and the vet had to come down give him medication and a tetnus shot and it cost $200. <br>  it all depends on what you need.<br>  <br>  If your getting basic tack, like a saddle, get it second hand. it is so much cheaper!!! look in the trading post (in australia) or ebay or a saddlery store near you and they will have saddles their for about $200-$500. bridles are like $30 and the bits are like $10-$30. but second hand ones are cheaper!!<br>  <br>  heres a website that will help you getting your childs first pony<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.equusite.com/articles/basics/basicsFirstPony.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.equusite.com/articles/basics/...</a><br>  <br>  hope this helps!!!<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|u1HahCoqaa	Ok, so lets say you get a horse for, say, $1,200.( Although horses range from $800- over $10,000. ) Well, you are gonna have to keep the horse somewhere. And unless you have a farm out in the country, you'll have to board your horse. Thats anywhere from $120-$500/month. So you have to pay that out 12x a year. Every year. And you'll have to buy feed, and possibly even hay if where you board doesn't provide it. My horse goes through a bale a day. Think $3.50 each, more or less. Grain- Well, that depends on what brand. Usually $10-25/50lb bag. Now, you'll also need tack, like a saddle, girth, and bridle atleast. Thats a good $1000+. Saddle pads- Average $15-20 ea. You'll need grooming supplies- about $25 tops. Now, your horse will need his feet trimmed every 8 weeks. He might even need shoes. That's about $120 (every 8 weeks) for shoes, $60 for a trim (every 8 weeks). What about worming? He'll need a dewormer every 4 mo or everyday. That's about $16+ ea. And what about vet bills? He will need his teeth floated every year or so. Thats not cheap. And if he gets hurt, thats really pricey. My horse needed 8 stiches- $400+. And unless you never want to go anywhere with your horse, you'll prolly need a truck and trailer to haul him. Thats like atleast $9,000. And thats not counting gas. Which, incase you havn't noticed, isn't cheap. And if you ever want to enter in shows, you'll have to pay show fees, plus the needed tests, like coggins, or vaccinations. Thats $50+ all together. Although some shows, the entry fee alone is $400. <br>  Yeah, your horse would prolly wanna blanket. Thats $25-$60.<br>  Oh, and clothes for you. <br>  ------------------<br>  Lessons would be nice, although not required. Think $15-50/time. Although it depends on where you live.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  I made that awhile ago- all of those may not apply. But you get the giest of it.  I suggest you do not get a fallabella- they are truely a novelty breed. Your child would not be able to ride it (Unless she is like 2) and it would be pricey to buy. Just make sure that when you are looking at ponies you have the child ride them, and gauge their temperment- Do not just count on what the owner says. And get a vet check done! Sellers will lie about anything. If you can, ask to have a thirty day "trial period".  And get a helmet for your child- not a used bike helmet. Although if you do use a bike helmet it isnt the end of the world, as it still isnt a far way to fall and they will not go very fast, and the child is still growing. If you can though, get a riding helmet. They are better than bike ones.<br>  <br>  EDIT: From a rescue? Good for you, although still get a vet check and be even more cautious in choosing the pony, as many have past issues and you do not know their past.|`|42HS47t1aa	Well it obviously depends on where you live and how much 'help' you want to pay for, for your horse.<br>  <br>  If you got to a DIY livery yard you might be able to house a horse there for as little as ￡150 a month. If you want a full livery (where they feed him, clean out his stall etc etc) you could be looking at upwards of ￡600 a month.<br>  <br>  Youve got to figure that feed and vet bills will run upwards of ￡100 per month, so in short, even at the very cheapest level you are looking at ￡250 a month, more realistically if you are willing to do some work yourself (ie visiting him every night and doing the feed, mucking out his stable etc) then roughly ￡400 a month is what its going to cost you.|`|ip5EWw7uaa	Apart from cost you need to work out jhow long they live for.

They are more like miniature horses than ponies, so are not able to carry that much weight at all. Your daughter would be much better off with a Shetland pony. <br>   Luckily, Shetlands are cheaper to keep than your average horse. Because of their thick coat, they can live outside most of the time. For housing, perhaps they could share a field with your friend's ponies? Or do you have your own land? If neither, you could hire a paddock nearby- expect to pay ￡20-￡25 a week. The paddock/field should have a water trough and some kind of shelter, like so:<br>  <a href="http://www.johnshieldswoodwork.co.uk/stables-devon/devon-field-shelters.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.johnshieldswoodwork.co.uk/sta...</a><br>   Feed-wise, the main staple of your pony's diet is grass. However, during the winter months he will need about 3kg of hay, and perhaps some kind of supplement feed. <br>   You will need equipment such as a basic grooming kit (hoof pick, body brush, curry comb) and of course tack. Your future pony may come with tack, which is perfect, but if not you will need to get him fitted. Contact your local tack shop (look in yellow pages) who will be able to advise you on saddles and bridles. Your pony might also need rugs depending on his coat, I can recommend Cuddly Ponies as they do rugs for smaller equines.<br>   <br>  If you need any more help/info, check out these handy websites:<br>  ?<a href="http://www.newrider.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.newrider.com/</a><br>  ?<a href="http://www.shetlandponystudbooksociety.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.shetlandponystudbooksociety.c...</a><br>  <br>  Hope you get your pony, also good on you for considering getting one from a charity.

She hardly ever leaves any now.<br>  There are a few problems that can arise from leaving food for dogs to pick at all day - for example aggression with food.  Reasons why a dog should NOT be able to 'graze' all day :<br>  1) A meal time schedule establishes a routine, certainty and security.<br>  2) A leader controls all resources at all times. Allowing your dog free access to food you make yourself irrelevant & unimportant.<br>  3) Many dogs can quickly put on weight and become obese, which often leads to skeletal problems.<br>  4) Dogs that are allowed to snack whenever they want often become fussy eaters that pick and choose. <br>  5)Flies can quickly become attracted to any type of food that is left out with a subsequent  risk of disease.<br>  6)When a dog is ill one of the first symptoms is a loss of appetite. If you don’t know if and when your dog last ate you could miss <br>  an early clue as to the state of your dog's health.<br>  7)An empty stomach is desirable before surgery. If your dog needs an emergency operation you won’t be able to tell your vet when  your dog last ate and there is an increased risk of choking in vomit.<br>  8)Free fed dogs often become obnoxious, inattentive, yappy, bossy and totally out of control.<br>  9)Meal times with a hungry dog are one of the best training opportunities, especially for puppies. [‘Sit’ and you can have a full tummy. Don’t do so and you will go hungry!]   Why waste such an opportunity?<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|xtQkSimpaa	I feed my 2 dogs in the morning, about 3/4 of what they will have in a day.

When she goe's into labour, you will see her lying down on her side, and you will see her start pushing...sometimes labour/delivery can take upwards of 2 hours before the first kitten is born....anything after two hours becomes dangerous and you should contact a vet.  Check out the links supplied to you above.|`|a984cQjKaa	do you have an idea of when she got pregnant?  cats usually give birth about 65 days after they get pregnant.  if you don't know, make sure you have a basket with a blanket set up in a nice quiet place for her and that she knows where it is.  she'll probably be a lot more affectionate, and she'll be looking for a place to have her babies.|`|YieEbTCWaa	Count the days and pay attention to her. You can never be too prepared, though... <br>  <br>  Some years ago we had been expecting our kitty's kittens, we had a little "nest" for her and all... One night we were at a familiy reunion and came back to find her all happy in my brother's bed, under the moist covers with a bunch of kitties...<br>  <br>  She was adorable, though, she looked at us as if saying proudly "look, I made every one of them".|`|8P4EvMRkaa	these pages should help you <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cat-pregnancy-report.com/cat-is-pregnant.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cat-pregnancy-report.com/cat-...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://cat-care.suite101.com/article.cfm/is_my_cat_pregnant" rel="nofollow">http://cat-care.suite101.com/article.cfm...</a>
VdeV0jUqaa	Is your 'tiel a baby or an adult? was it handraised?<br>  If it was handraised you shouldnt have a problem letting it out of the cage- the more you handle it the faster it will bond with you.<br>  Before you do let your bird out of its cage its a good idea to take it to the vets to have its wing clipped- especially when you are just beginning to handle it. This will stop your bird from panicking and flying away and potentially hurting itself.<br>  After your birds wing is clipped you can start by opening the cage door and letting him come out for an explore, or, if he is willing, you can start trying to handle him.<br>  Its definately worth reading up on Cockatiels, and parrot behaviour and training to learn more about your pet and its needs. Good luck!|`|eo0Uv7Wsaa	I agree with the first answer.  Clip the wings it will make this process SOOO much easier! I don't know what else but for you to look at this link. It tells you how to hand tame a cockatiel. The sooner you get this out of the way the sooner and more likely he will be one of those birds who loves people, loves being handled etc. If you don't tame him he might be a bird how bites people and all that stuff.

Okzc9Hl6aa	Your best bet is to contact your local breed club (and you don't have a location posted, but the national breed club has a listing of regional clubs here - <a href="http://www.rrcus.org/club/regionalclubs/index.htm)" rel="nofollow">http://www.rrcus.org/club/regionalclubs/...</a> and ask if they have a mentoring program. Some things I would include are whether or not you have a dog yet or are still looking for your first, what your background is in dogs (will this be your first dog, or have you owned dogs in the past but not shown, etc), what your particular interests are (conformation? lure coursing? Agility?). If you're a junior handler (under 18), be sure and mention that, too. <br>  <br>  When contacting the clubs, it's not necessary to give a ton of information. Simply a "I am new to the world of ridgebacks and am looking for my first show-quality dog and someone to mentor me, does your club offer any programs like this" is probably enough. <br>  <br>  In addition to the breed clubs, you might also want to contact your local all-breed clubs. Many of my best friends in dog showing have come from the all breed club rather than my local specialty club- they may not know everything about my breed, but handling is handling and you can still learn a LOT, particularly from people with similar breeds (for example, the other hounds, in your case.)|`|WVNMnvXLaa	what the **** is a Rhodesian Ridgeback mentor?
16xfUewoaa	Trying to introduce the kitten back into the litter is probably the best thing to do, because it's the most natural. However if this doesn't work, then you'll have to keep it warm, by wrapping it in blankets etc.<br>  The most important thing to note, is that you CANNOT give it normal cow's milk, because this contains lactose, and cats are lactose intolerant, so you may end up making it very sick. If you have whiskers cat milk (or any other milk designed for cats) give some to it, otherwise use some warm water (although it might not like it much, it's safer).<br>  <br>  Good luck with it =)|`|QNX9NET3aa	You need to buy kitten formula. Or find a mother cat who is nursing and see if she will adopt it. I would keep the kitten warm and call an animal shelter.|`|a984cQjKaa	try to get the mother to take it back, but if she won't you'll have to get some KMR or similarly formulated milk for kittens and some little bottles.  the kitten will have to have a nice warm place for it to sleep, and you'll have to feed it the KMR, warmed to body tempurature, every couple of hours.  then once you're done feeding it, you'll have to rub it's little butt with a warm, wet washcloth so he'll go to the bathroom.  you can always call your local humane society for advice, or to find someone else to foster the poor thing if you don't feel you have the time or patience to do it.<br>  good luck!|`|aHfv3xcraa	The best thing for it is its mum, without her it is VERY likely to die, If your smell rubs off on the kitten she wont accept it back, try to transfer some of the mums smell back onto the kitten and trying mixing it back in with the others when she is not looking. There are many reasons why mother would abandon a kitten but usually its because its their first litter and not very good at being a mum. My cat kept rolling on to hers nearly squishing them to death, we would hear them squealing and have to roll her off them.<br>  Make sure food and water is near by because mum will be very weak and will start to lose weight rapidly now she is feeding newborns. You have a very busy 6 weeks ahead of you!!!|`|11MlFWSHaa	usually the mother will abandon her young if it is ill or not striving like the rest of her litter, so she wont take the kitten back now but if you can get some special new kitten milk from vet or pet store and perchase a special bottle for the young you can then nurse it yourself. just make sure to boil the bottles and nipples ect like you would a newborn infants and follow instructions on the milk container, you will have to take a warm moist cloth and rub its privates to stimulate the urination and bowel movements of the baby as it cannot go on its own until its a little older. keep the baby warm with soft towels and if u have a little stuffed toy thats clean to help keep the baby company that helps too. if its to much for u to take on then please take the young to ur local animal shelter asap so they can care for the precious baby.|`|oIN5URfcaa	No..the mother will leave it again. feed both with milk and send it to SPCA both will have food and being adopt.they can't actually take care of themself. if you wish to adopt it, you can adopt both two months later so that the kitten is not weak already...

You might be able to push it a bit more with extra filtering and water changes.<br>  <br>  I suggest you sell or give away some of the fish, and just keep the best ones as you do have space for a few more.<br>  <br>  Ian|`|Qhdozm54aa	As Ian has said, about 5-6 fancy goldfish would be the maximum. Common goldfish will need a much larger tank or better still a pond.|`|9bz6EpoLaa	As long as the babies are big enough to not fit in the parents mouths, they should be fine in there with them. 11 goldfish in a 55g would be plenty!

y7H1V39Jaa	What a disposition, you can see it in his eye, looks like you were putting him to sleep loving him.  I'll bet that he is going to be so versatile.  He appears to me to be either Quarter or TB crossed with the Belgian.  Lot's of bone but refined enough to probably be a good rider as well, English or Western.  He would also be very suitable to drive to cart or carriage, again, good bone, good disposition, but with enough refinement to have good movement.  Have you ridden him yet?  Oh, looks like a bump on his R knee, or is that just in the photo?  Anyway, he looks like a winner, sincerely.  A buddy for a long time.|`|BIshtm7oaa	He has good conformation. He has a short neck, but that is normal for draft breeds so I wouldn't count it off for him. His should is kind of steep shoulder but that isn't one of the big faults either. There aren't too many good conformation shots so I can't tell if he is toed out or anything.<br>  <br>  Great horse. By his hip and his shoulders I would guess he's mixed with a TB.|`|472fd8c2d5c8d3685860a41f0f7b00c3aa	I just had a quick look because I'm getting ready for school, but it seems to me he has a rather short neck and a steep shoulder.  The steep shoulder just means that his trot will probably be a bit bouncy- nothing you can do to correct that.  I'm not sure how the short neck will affect him, though.|`|GU2UVPSsaa	i think hes a belgian/halflinger<br>  i think thats how he got his color and disposition. but thats just what i thinkk  =)|`|LwYbEV3Laa	He is definitely a  Belgian cross, he might just be full belgian. I don't see the quarter horse in him (to much knee action), the only other thing that I can think of is the TB. He has the typical draft front end (short neck, low neck and chest attachment, thick throat latch). There is nothing you can do about that part except it's going to be tougher to "lift his front end" but in the pictures, seems as if he drives from the behind fairly well. His legs looks to be fairly correct as he is shorter in his cannon bone compaired to his forearm. <br>  As far as training, I would go for the basics (dressage would be good) and decide what you both like before getting into something seriously.|`|ZDFw8o1Saa	If I had to guess at what other breed he was I'd have to say thoroughbred.  He has a short neck which just his belgian side and a nice flat back.  He does look as though he had a small nick on his right front knee.  He looks like he might try to be a bit of a trickster but in the long run I see a gentle willing horse.  I think you might want to try dressage with him if you're into that kind of riding but that's just me.  I'd get some other opinions too.  One this you have to watch out for with Belgian blood is they eventually realize just how strong they are and will try to take advantage of that.  Make sure if he gets out of hand while being ridden to turn him in a circle and this will make him stop because of lack of balance.  He'll have a huge canter and probably a fast one so you'll have to teach him to collect.  Another note on his physical health, he looks as though he's being taken care of well and he's in good form.  Also his feet look good though I bet they're really heavy.<br>  <br>  Thoroughbredtrainin'girl|`|htq1LqEeaa	He is really a beautiful animal. It looks like you two have really connected with each other. I would guess maybe he has quarter horse in him, i don't know about the TB really. You have a photo of another with him, aside from the different colour he looks to have a similar build as that one.<br>  I bet he is going to be a great ride. He has a nice hip, nice shoulder and looks to have (from what I can see- no real front pics) he has great strong straight legs. Doesn't appear to be pigeon toed, cow hocked or anything like that. Yes he is built upright in the shoulder and a thick neck but that is totally to do with the Belgian breed. They are supposed to be like that to pull stuff. <br>  Also, Palomino is not a breed, it is a colour.<br>  He really looks like a wonderful kind boy and I bet you enjoy every minute with him. That Belgian breeding is such a kind breed
YuTFG3feaa	I have four 10 month old puppies that do the same thing.  The way I got them to stop (and they always find something new after you stop one area from being "ate") is Cheyenne pepper for the carpet, sprinkle the area she is currently working on heavily and any areas, like in doorways or halls that you think she might go to next.  Try to think like her and stay one step ahead.  Wires I try to keep out of reach, but if not possible purchase some "Bitter Apple Spray" at the pet store and spray wires liberally with it.  Same goes with wood whether it wood stairways or furniture.  I also add more of the pepper or spray to the areas already treated periodically until I am sure they have moved on away from those particular areas permanently.<br>  <br>  The main thing to do though is to make sure she has plenty of toys, preferably Kong brand, to chew on while she is teething.  Even an old sock with a knot tied in it and stuffed animals help.  My pups like the sock because it has my scent.  Try to avoid rawhide chews if a all possible though and stick with toys she can not "eat"  like the cheap ones.  You are only looking for a vet bill with those items.|`|9kTejB0uaa	Next to Labs, Bassets are the world's greatest chewers, given the chance.<br>  <br>  Get a crate for the times you are not around!!!  It's truly the only way, other than a pen (and they can be surprisingly nimble at climbing out despite their little legs), to contain them and prevent this sort of disaster.  There is a danger element in all this destruction too, if she's into electric cables. <br>  <br>  Speak to her breeder if you are having this sort of trouble because Bassets, contrary to popular belief, are entirely trainable.  You just have to get into their mindset - not for nothing is it said you are owned by a Basset, not the other way round.  Are you having to leave her on her own for long periods?  This is a Pack hound, and having company, much as all dogs are basically pack animals, is essential to the Basset.  They need to be in the centre of a family, not left alone for hours on end.  Even if you get a cat, this would help things - although another dog would be far better.<br>  <br>  More information please about her life-style, and I might be able to give more help here.|`|ylQXC2Mraa	Basset puppies require lots of watching.  Make sure she has a lot of ok things to chew and play with in a room that has nothing that is a no no in it.   only let her into the rest of the house when there will be someone there to correct the bad behavior. They are a stubborn dog so you will have to make sure to supervise till you can trust her.  They are a great breed once you have them trained.  Remember you are the boss and make sure she knows.  We loved ours for 12 years before we lost her but that first year is really a challenge.     good luck
4b8fb7d13eab5f34e3a4f0ce4fbb2680aa	B1tches are in season for roughly 3 weeks. The 1st week, the discharge is bright red & copious, the 2nd weeks the discharge lessens and becomes lighter in colour - this is when the ***** is at her most receptive to males. The 3rd week, the ***** may or may not continue to have a discharge (whether she has been mated or not). All dates are rough averages, all b1tches are different and the 1st season can be different from future seasons. If she continues to bleed for another week or 2, you might want to take her to the vet for a check up. <br>  To be absolutely safe, don't leave her unattended for 28 days since the 1st day you saw colour (blood).<br>  If you intend spaying the best time will be around 3 months after her season when her hormones have returned to normal and the blood supply to the uterus is at its lowest level.<br>  Yes, her sister will probably come into season in the near future.|`|UmhWxs1laa	First heats are funny things.  Sounds like she had a "split heat".  Not uncommon.<br>  <br>  Yes, one girl in season can cause more to come into heat, come in early, etc.<br>  <br>  How long before she can be let off lead?

Three days no blood they can run with the pack.|`|9kTejB0uaa	Normally bitches are in season for 21 days, give or take a day or two (they don't all read the text-books).  For the first 10 days or so you will see a blood coloured discharge.  By day 10 -13 the discharge should have gone to a pale straw colour.  This is the time she's ready for mating (again, normally, some stand earlier, and some not until the last week).  After those days, some bitches do come back into bleeding (red) until the end of the 21 days, but it normally lessens towards the end of these 21 days until it finally stops.<br>  <br>  I hope you aren't taking her out to a heavily dog populated area or you will be driving the other males nuts - and laying a trail back to your door for any roaming male to follow.  But yes, keep her on a lead in your back garden for the full 21 days.  She may well be as keen to escape and find a mate, as any male will be to get to her!!<br>  <br>  Quite often one ****** will 'bring' another into season, but more likely sisters will come in around the same time, because they are sisters.  Now might be a good time to spay the other one, and get the one who is in spayed in another couple of months, once her hormones have settled down again.|`|b2a5a3043bdf63534f0643e795165672aa	my dog did this 4weeks after and we took her to the vet who said it was a split season.

When urinated on, woods release a chemical that can poison your animal. This happens less in some woods, but unsafe is unsafe.<br>  <br>  Regular newsprint is just fine, though it may need to be changed more often. I pick up freebie newspapers from the library. Most papers use soy ink (safe) and my vet actually recommended it. She said she has the rat cages in her office cleaned daily and they use newsprint.<br>  <br>  Lay the papers on the floor of the cage, overlapping them so all areas are covered, and then tear some paper into strips and leave it on the bottom. Rats are fantastic nest builders and they'll arrange things the way they like it.<br>  <br>  Again, avoid fabric unless it's felt or fleece - these are the only ones that don't fray. Threads can get wrapped around little toes or your animal can become completely entangled.|`|cT2QY0Qpaa	Critter care odor control. Wal-Mart carries this in plain and other assorted colors at a higher price. It costs about $5.99, and a bag of which can easily take care of a ten gallon tank for three to four weeks. It lasts twice as long as other bedding and it's made from reclaimed cellulose so it's hypoallergenic. Pine,cedar, and corn cob are dangerous to the respiratory system and skin.  Side effects from such bedding choices include: ring-tail, pneumonia, cancer, ulcers,  mycoplasmatic flairs, intestinal blockage, and lowered life expectancy. Reclaimed cellulose based products are more expensive than wood shavings and corn cob but the odor control is great and a bag of it goes a lot farther than the other products.  It's also more tolerable to change and no dust.  Helps my asthma greatly.|`|27m0O7wPaa	I use pine bedding bc it smells the best.  I also add other softer litter.  I change it every week.

Okzc9Hl6aa	If you are wanting to prepare a homemade diet, please do your research and reading. I'ts not as simple as buying a specific kind of meat all the time. I'd highly recommend the yahoogroup "Rawfeeding" and the book "The Ultimate Pet Food Guide" by Liz Palika (there's others that are good too, that's just one I know well enough to recommend.) <br>  <br>  If you just want a simple diet, there are good prepared diets out there, ranging from dehydrated raw diets (Honest Kitchen is my favorite, but it's pricey for a large dog) to kibbles made of free-range meat and sustainably-farmed veggies and grains. The Dog Food Project (<a href="http://www.dogfoodproject.com/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodproject.com/)</a> has a lot of good information on prepared diets. <br>  <br>  With a GSD, I'd be very concerned about making sure that your pup gets good nutrition since it's so important for bone growth and development. Hopefully the link, group, and book recc will give you a place to get started. Canine nutrition isn't rocket science, but it's not as simple as plopping down a steak every day either. As a vegetarian, you're probably used to balancing your own diet and compensating for vitamins and nutrients which aren't readily available in most veggies (iron and calcium come to mind) by eating others or taking supplements- with dogs, it's the same thing.
q7GBzr6yaa	excessive drooling is not necessarily one of the symptoms of illness. There are many benign reasons why dogs drool, so it's important not to jump to conclusions. Your veterinarian is the best person to diagnose unusual symptoms, including excessive drooling<br>  <br>  Check your dog's teeth. Do his teeth look normal? Do his gums seem irritated? Does he still have his baby teeth? Think about whether he has recently chewed a bone or a stick that may have caused a cut that could be infected. <br>  Look for stinging insects such as bees or wasps near your dog. Drooling can be one of the symptoms of multiple insect stings around the dog's face, mouth or tongue, as the stinging can cause swelling of the dog's mouth tissue. <br>  Record your impressions about your dog to give to the vet. How is his diet and bowel functions? Are there any other symptoms that you might need to tell the vet? <br>  Understand that while excessive drooling is likely benign, it may be a symptom of several more serious conditions, including poisoning, stomach problems or even paralysis of the tongue caused by rabies (which of course can be avoided if you keep your dog protected with a rabies vaccine.) Again, your vet is the best person to diagnose any symptoms in dogs.|`|mzQhw8pLaa	i think bone is stuck on his throat!|`|Okzc9Hl6aa	Drooling can be a symptom of nausea- but it can also be a number of other things ranging from a broken or painful tooth (and he's the right age for teething), nibbling or licking the blankets (I have one dog that likes to lick any place someone has rested their stinky feet) to just plain sleeping with their mouth open! Glad you're taking him into the vet and good luck.

Um8osMNuaa	Weight loss is a sign of worms, have you seen any worms in the vomit or her poo, a bad case of worms can make pups sick, as they vomit them up. You need to see the vet again and get her checked, take a poo sample with you, this can be tested for worms. lf not worms then you need to find out what it is, young pups can go down hill very quickly once they become ill, early treatment is needed.|`|mh0QRDE9aa	If  she is puking and losing weight, she needs to be tested for worms.  Get her back to the vet for a check up asap.|`|YuTFG3feaa	Take her to the vet to find out what is wrong with her instead of trying to guess what is wrong yourself!  lol
jM7CyxQzaa	Google and they take it to a wildlife sanctuary or their local vet for treatment and possible transfer to a wildlife sanctuary if the problem is too much for them to handle themselves. Either way a professional should asess the situation.<br>  <br>  OR - you are actually a possum expert :)

fFtBqFB6aa	my husband and i bring Winston's crate into the bedroom at night, that way, if he needs to go out in the middle of the night, he can wake us up.|`|iVQULHqYaa	This is a standard reply which I have saved, unfortunately it refers to a male puppy.<br>  If you were a baby and had been taken from your mother and left alone, you would cry all night. He has been left alone in a strange place; he is frightened, confused and miserable. There are lots of adult dogs who suffer all of their lives from separation anxiety; some of these dogs belong to the people who will tell you just to let your puppy cry. Please don’t listen and don’t leave him to cry, it's easy to resolve this and its kind.<br>  <br>  Try this, it will work and both you and your puppy will have good nights sleep,<br>  After he has been fed and CARRIED out to the garden for his pees and poos, let him wander around the garden, then put him in  a room on his own with a comfortable bed.  Close the door and then immediately go back into the room and IGNORE HIM. Spend a minute or two cleaning your work tops if he is in the kitchen or pretending to be occupied with something else. Walk out again and close the door and walk back in again immediately. Keep doing this over and over again. Eventually you can leave a short gap before you go back into the kitchen, when you know that he is asleep you can stop doing this.<br>  <br>  You must listen for him waking up and you MUST GET TO HIM BEFORE HE CRIES. Pick him up and CARRY him into the garden. <br>  <br>   Play with him and let him explore the garden. If it's time for another meal, give him this and take him out again, because he will want another pee. (Always praise your dog profusely when he pees or poos outside). Then put him into his bed, close the door to his room and start doing the door thing over and over again. <br>  <br>  This is time consuming, however it works. By the end of day one he will have been put to bed several times and he will think that you are just on the other side of the door. Continue doing this for a couple of days and he will grow up without Separation Anxiety and he will stop crying at night. My dogs have never had Separation Anxiety; I think that they think that I never leave the house. I have given this advice to several people and it has worked very quickly, I know this because I have had emails from them.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|54GBWTgoaa	Don't worry she is still very young and is just missing company at night, i would strongly suggest crating her with the door shut at night, each time she whines or barks>>she may really need to pee or something so take her out to pee and then pop her straight back in her crate and say nothing to her!!<br>  <br>  make sure her crate is not to big for her or she will potty in it and make sure it has a hard base>>so just leave the rubber or plastic mat in there and put a small blanket >>but fold it up so it doesn't cover the whole base, my puppy would pee AND poo because she would confuse the pillow i put in there with her pee pads and the grass!!!<br>  leave something that smells of you and her fav toy!<br>  <br>  <br>  exercise her as much as you can in the house>>play with her and play tug of war and fetch....make sure she has peed before going in the crate and practice using it throughout the day>>>she will probably whine but you must ignore her, if you think she needs to pee then DON'T talk to her or pet her, put her to go pee and then right back in again and ignore her, sometimes leave the door open while your cooking and stuff>>> she will get used to it!<br>  <br>  maybe put her in a communal place like the hallway so she doesn't feel segregated...good luck and hope this helps :)|`|c7c42fcd2fd4b62ba49207bebbdb931daa	If she will stay in her crate while you do that, then go for it.  We had a heck of a time with our girl when she was a puppy - wouldn't sleep in her little crate, wouldn't stay in the bottom part of the crate when we put it on our bed, wouldn't stay in the covered foam bed that we put on our bed....  She was going to end up on our bed anyways, we were just worried about squishing her (she was soooo small) or her peeing on the bed.  Neither happened, and she now happily sleeps on or between our pillows  : )|`|Um8osMNuaa	My 7 month old pup goes in his crate, he has done since he was 10 weeks old, l did get up during the night to let him out, but now he sleeps through.<br>  You should do whatever you thinks best for her, but l'd put her in her crate. lf you sleep downstairs then she'll get used to this and probably not settle if you you stop doing it.

Try putting her in her cage for a few minutes at a time through the day, leave the room and wait to see what happens, if she is good (quiet) then return and make a big fuss of her, lots of affection and a treat.If she howls/barks/cries do not praise/fuss/treat, just return and release her.  Gradually increase the time you leave her and eventually she will learn that you will always come back and that you are happy if she has been good, especially if you treat (most dogs are ruled by their tummies!)    You could also try leaving a radio on quietly so there is reassuring voices,this worked for me.  My dog had separation issues and howled all night at first!!! He now sleeps all night (we sometimes are awake as he snores rather loudly!) and is a happy pup in the morning! This also works better at night if pup has been walked so is tired and doesn't need to go potty. Hope this helps, sleep deprivation is not good eh!?|`|ylQXC2Mraa	We always end up with them in our bed, but I have a friend that always puts hers in a crate with lots of toys in a different room and after a couple of nights they settle down and are quiet all night. Don't let them out at night or you will be doing it forever. If you have too, start cutting off their access to water in the evening. This worked with our basset. Good luck|`|yilREYWGaa	Our pup stays in a big cage. She is good when you ask her too she goes in but she will do her best not to if she is having too much fun so the best thing to do is wait until she is calm until you put her to sleep otherwise she doesnt understand why one minute you got her all excited and the next you want her shut in her cage.|`|IcYXQlf9aa	Can you crate her in your room at night- isolation is very stressful for puppies. If you let her out at night, it should be only to go to the bathroom and then right back in the crate with no playing , talking or treats.|`|WWhYCAbSaa	You can exercise her in your yard.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	CRATE them.<br>  Keeps them SAFE & quiet & CLEAN.<br>  I prefer housebroken & live animals & a not destroyed house,don't you?|`|N9pKl35Xaa	I slept in a tent with our older dog when he was a pup, slept like a baby. Half the time he'd go out of the tent and sleep outside of it than in the morning he'd come in and jump all over me.<br>  <br>  With our second pup, he slept in our laundry in his little doggy basket and we didnt hear a peep out of him, expect when we first put him in the laundry he'd bash on the metal thing we had stopping him from getting into the house, until he knocked it over. But we just stayed there and waited until he fell asleep in his basket and he also slept like a baby all through his puppy stages, no barking, howling nothing. <br>  <br>  People recommand putting a teddy in their crate, basket whatever with a clock so when they hear the ticking they think its their mothers heart beat. So maybe get her used to playing with a teddy and when she gets really attached to it, when you put her to sleep, cut the bottom out of the teddy and put a clock in it. My nan done it with her Maltese Mutt when it was a pup and she never heard a peep out of the dog again.|`|SSCaFfm9aa	Put them in a cage to sleep.<br>  <br>  If you let in and let her out everytime she cries she is never going to stop.<br>  <br>  You just gotta ignore her and she will learn that when you put her in the cage at night thats where she is going to stay no matter what.<br>  <br>  <br>  Do this on nights where you don't work... cuz you won't sleep|`|LoBKzXNTaa	We left our jack russel in the dining room. but after a week, she made it up the stairs and she sleeps on the floor of our room.|`|yG33SKVHaa	i put mine in a dog crate with a blanket over it.
b476b1c4e024dc79208eb923ae096217aa	They're trainable just like a dog, only problem is they aren't as social.  If you can train a cat to go in the toilet I'm sure you can train them to go outside.  I trained my cat to play fetch.  A good way to start, might be by placing the litter box outside, leaving the door open and showing them the box.  Maybe even leave some food in a bowl nearby so they can associate even faster.|`|e10742839c789d3e878f426e4a088f0faa	DON'T!!!<br>  Kittens and adult cats can fal prey to TOO many HORRIBLE and unspeakable acts of both animals and humans.

Every time you feed him, put him in the box outside afterward. If you catch him going potty in the house, or looking for his old box, put him in the box outside. Basically, just try to show him that he has a new place - and make sure he ALWAYS has access to it. It's very unfair to expect him to go outside, if the cat can't get outside without human help. Eventually he'll stop using the box outside and just go in the yard. Just make sure you keep your kids' sandbox covered!|`|AA12258575	put it outside until it gos to the bathroom and if it doesn't try getting a litter box

AA10217244	The price depends on where you're self-service dog wash is located.  Before moving to the coast six years ago, I used a dog wash in Napa, CA, about once a month.  At that time, it cost $12.  The price is now about $18, more if you use any additional services (i.e., having their personnel wash and/or dry your dog, brush him out, trim his/her nails or clean his/her ears).  At this facility, the price includes a smock to keep you dry, a fabric collar-leash combination with a clip on it to facilitate tying the dog in the tub, your choice of shampoo, a conditioning detangler, ear clearer, nail clippers, towels, and a variety of combs and brushes.  A quiet hair dryer is built into the wall near the counter and special tie-downs are located inside and next to the tub for  dogs who prefer not to be bathed.  Since I have a bad back and can't lean over for more than a few seconds, I found it extremely convenient to use the tubs, which put both of my dogs (a black Lab and a Golden Retriever) at waist height (I'm 5'6").  The business in Napa offers a variety of tub heights, plus a choice of stair walk-ups and ramp walk-ups.  This makes it easy for owners of elderly or arthritic animals to get larger pets onto the counter and into the tub without having to pick them up.  Believe me, that's next to impossible with a 90 lb. Golden Retriever!  Another plus--you leave with a dry, shiny clean dog who can't run into the yard and roll in the dirt!  The only con I can come up with is having a Golden Retriever shake when he gets out of the tub - and he's at chest heightl!|`|AA11109495	be careful when you take your dogs to these places, i have two yorkies and i NEVER take them to any grooming place. these places harm the dogs or hurt them when they dont stop barking. learn how to do everything your self. i do my dogs nails, ear trims, and anal glands....saves you money and you know your dog will not be hurt and traumatized.|`|c96d30e0ba1052cfed5fa3bf49e155ccaa	i pay around $18.00 just for a bath then grooming runs me about $12.00 more.

62d5f401819d4de72c7a3f4a36a1f070aa	yes, hearing and "speaking" are different functions, and the inability to do one is unrelated to the other.  deaf people usually speak differently than hearing people, since they can't hear the way that words should be pronounced, and the way they are saying the words themselves.  but, barking really has only one pronunciation; really no way to mess it up!  the dog can smell, and feel vibrations, and see things, so it will still bark.|`|0e46899c270211768c4844f79c521cc1aa	I have 2 collies that have been deaf since birth.

AA12303431	I think its beef heart as well; but its really not as good as regular dog food! A small (marble sized) piece of beef fat is a nice treat that will do your dog some good.<br>  Some dogs are picky eaters, if thats the case then try adding canned Butchers Tripe or sardines in oil to her food. Drain the oil off first. Sardines are great because they have protein, oil and calcium. <br>  And make sure you're using a reasonable quality dog food, if she has a small appetite and is full easily then you need to cram the most nutrients into the smallest volume of food. Cheap dog foods contain more filler and she doesn't need that.<br>  I've yet to meet a dog that would turn their nose up at either.|`|b5b08a7f14d2315049ad9f67246d2a56aa	it's beef heart, but I don't know why that should build a dog up any better than regular food|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	Are you sure he didn't say "beef heart"?|`|1e0e0999160f4b7c5687b6c136af4d19aa	i've never herd of it, but then again, i only fed my dogs normal meat. you could ask the breeder what beestart is. as for the chinese, i think you could copy it, and then go to babel fish, and from there you can translate it. that might help.|`|AA11985426	think your hearing it wrong either that or the breeder can't speak.

My black & white (full coat) has extremely manageable hair, but I have her groomed 2x per month by a professional groomer.  I also brush her several times per week, even though she doesn't generally require it.  The topknot requires a lot of work, though, unless your dog is very accustomed to having one.  Mine is, so she is easy to maintain.  It is really up to you, but their standard is full coat or long hair.|`|c9c76297191ac14d97bee289977e7fa7aa	According to breed standard, Shih Tzus should have a long, flowing coat. Really it is up to you. A long coat requires lots of brushing and combing, as well as regular grooms, to keep the coat in good condition. A shorter cut such as a puppy cut or a teddy bear trim, is easier to maintain. It depends on what is better for you. Whichever you prefer and can keep up is right for your dog.
19d00a2d61ec917f60c7b5519af0b5a1aa	It's not all that unusual.  I had concerns over my dogs when I travelled with them as well.  What is happening is that your dog has been trianed to go in certain areas.  He's learned this by associating odors.  Most likely, the odor is quite different when you travel and the dog is confused.<br>  <br>  What you have to understand is that no dog will hold their business until they are sick or die.  Make sure they have ample opportunity and leave the rest up to them.|`|a80d8c7bd0935e2ca29d03eb25666310aa	well monkey see monkey do, so maybe if you show your puppy she will want to go, no just kidding they say if you take your dog for walks all the time they get used to going in various spots they are comfortable with.  Next time when you go on your trip go for 3 or 4 days, your dog will have no choice to go, they only go in their favorite spots so it could be that she isn't comfortable yet with travelling.|`|a9c5c8e2f3f0e40d3b0b29fdb4cb0cfcaa	i doubt that your puppy could refrain from peeing for a whole weekend, she probably was going, but in a place you obviously haven't found yet :) puppies bladders are weak, but they get stronger as they grow, which is why dogs can "hold it" until they go outside..|`|e7178fa46e8e6b5f6ee3783f36464958aa	Walk them around alot|`|3e54ef59d2f31682466ffcbed9d9b307aa	Some dogs dont like to go when they are outside their environment.

You are more than likely in for some serious vet bills and probably heartbreak.......take it back.|`|DLtj51ALaa	Well, I can only guess at what you are asking.  I assume your puppy is 6 weeks old as that would be 42 days old.  Are her bowels loose?  If so has she been on a worming schedule?  If she has not been routinely wormed, her bowels can become loose.  <br>  <br>  If you have just acquired her, the stress of moving and the change in water can cause loose stools.  Give her distilled water and then when her stoold harden, begin titrating her off of distilled by giving her 1/2 distilled to 1/2 tap water.  Keep increasing the tap water over the period of 5 days until she is on 100% tap water.<br>  <br>  Is she weaning?  Have you recently changed foods?  Changing from soaked food to dry or from low pro to high pro can cause loose stools.<br>  <br>  Finally, has she just gotten her first shot?  Sometimes a puppy can have loose stools after a shot.<br>  <br>  If there is blood in her stool, you might want to consult with a vet - or - if none of the scenarios I have listed apply.<br>  <br>  Also, you may want to rephrase your question to be more specific.|`|SpYgLhzUaa	If you have purchased the puppy then she is far too young to have been taken away from her mum. Puppies of that age go to the toilet frequently. You need to make sure she has plenty of fluid so she doesn't dehydrate. Get a puppy milk replacer powder and some high quality puppy feed kibble. Make up some milk and soak the kibble in it and give it to your puppy. Make sure she also has plenty of fresh clean water. If she isn't lapping yet you need to get her a new born baby bottle and put the puppy milk replacer in that and let her suckle.|`|qg7S7eWUaa	I dont get the question???|`|zVjm9932aa	I'd dearly love to help you but, sorry, I don't understand the question.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Prashanth, add some more details so we can help you.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Ok, at that age I like to see a puppy still with its mother but too late for that now. The pet shop should sell a milk that is a replacement for the mother dog's milk. Do not use regular cow's milk. I would feed the same type puppy food that the pet shop was feeding since it was alright when you first got it. Are you feeding a puppy food made for puppies and not one for grown dogs? Also, a puppy that age will need feeding often but in small amounts. Make sure not to overfeed. Has the puppy had all its vacinations? If not I'd take him to the vet immediately. If you don't get the advise you need this time, ask again. I'll post a site for you.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Well if it isn't loose and she has just had 3 bowel movements there doesn't sound like there is a problem. She may have only had one movement yesterday because pet shops don't feed their animals as often as owners do. If the bowels are solid and she seems alert and playful(at times) then she sounds fine.

Ktuf0On2aa	nei pesci rossi LA FECONDAZIONE DELLE UOVA AVVIENE DOPO che queste sono state espulse quindi se vuoi avere degli avannotti non togliere il maschio subito dopo la deposizione.<br>  E' anzi consigliabile che più maschi fecondino le (tantissime) uova. Prendo dal libro sui pesci rossi"la vasca adatta per la riproduzione",: capienza minima 150 litri; riempimento con acqua nuova; temperatura 18/20 gradi centigradi (qualche grado in più per le varietà pregiate); presenza di un certo numero di piante a foglia larga (le uova si devono attaccare).<br>    Il resto lo riassumo.<br>   La deposizione avviene di solito alla mattina presto e dura per alcune ore con vari intervalli, i segni premonitori sono gli animali più eccitati del solito, spesso la femmina balza fuori dall'acqua e vi ricade pesantemente. Dopo vari giochi amorosi la femmina conduce il maschio nel luogo prestabilito dove lei depone e uno o più maschi feconda. Avvenuto ciò è bene separare gli adulti dalle uova, possibilmente anche le femmine dai maschi che tornerebbero ad insidiarle subito. Se i pesci adulti mostrano delle ferite è bene disinfettarli con un po' di blu di metilene(suppongo si riferisca ai pesci trasferiti in un' altra vasca). Le uova sidovrebbero schiudere in 4-6 giorni.|`|018d205e043290ce90455aa73acab378aa	se dove si trova il tuo pesce "incinta" ehehe  ci sono  altri pesci, lo devi isolare altrimenti possono mangiare le uova, devi creare come una stanza per suo conto, sempre dentro acquario con pareti di plastica, non so se mi sono spiegata bene|`|jQH6brEDaa	Niente fa' tutto da sola.|`|apF7LN3Maa	Servirebbe un ostetrica (ostrica)|`|c8BVuakHaa	Il pesce rosso (carasside)è oviparo quindi fa le uova di solito attaccate a delle piante a proposito ce le ha il tuo acquario perchè altrimenti non saprei proprio dove le possa deporre.dopo che le ha deposte vedi di isolare bene la zona prima che altri o la madre stessa le mangino e divorino pure i piccolini quando nascono.Se invece hai un acquario tropicale e il tuo pesce è un guppy allora è ovoviparo (quindi che tiene le uova in pacia e nascono direttamente i piccoli)devi prendere un'apposita sala parto che trovi nei negozi degli acquari e appena nascono i piccoli togli subito la madre altrimenti se li mangia.In bocca al pesce!|`|d089450f003c3cbf1c147d680c3220f5aa	Non ti preoccupare che fa da solo (sola).|`|da428daafc36fee55fe3ffffd7452fe3aa	basta che non ti fai venire in mente di farla partorire furi dall acqua   ; -  )|`|2ada4efa338ced72dc52971c44daae52aa	Di solito i pesci fanno le uova non partoriscono :-) eheheh  a meno che è un animale geneticamente modificato :-) scherzi a parte cosa intendi per partorire? Ciao|`|72gRLM0caa	Impossibile. I pesci rossi non partoriscono ma depongono uova minuscole e trasparenti, evento per altro rarissimo in cattività.Se hai un pesce rosso con la pancia non è sicuramente perché deve deporre, non te ne accorgeresti di sicuro. E' una varietà selezionata così panciuta. Se reconditamente facesse le uova le devi prelevare con la massima attenzione e custodirle in un altro acquario già organizzato (no acqua del rubinetto, leggere i parametri chimici) con un ossigenatore efficiente. Alla schiusa le devi alimentare con cibo per avannotti, <br>  reperibile nei negozi di acquariologia, e devi stare attento che non entrino nel filtro. Non posso stare con gli adulti finche non hanno una grandezza adeguata altrimenti se li mangiano!|`|ApSySHPvaa	Se fosse veramente "incinta", cosa di cui dubito vista la rarità con cui si riproducono i rossi in cattività, dovresti solo attendere la schiusa delle uova, che però potrebbero venire mangiate dagli altri abitanti dell'acquario.<br>  Una volta nati gli avannotti dovresti cercare di trasferirli o in un altro acquarietto (con valori dell'acqua identici a quelli dell'acquario dove sono nati) oppure puoi acquistare una "sala parto" da inserire nel tuo stesso acquario e dove tenerli fino a che non diventano più grandi.<br>  Un'altra scelta adottata da molti acquariofili è quella di lasciar fare alla natura, ovvero non toccare niente e far si che sopravvivano esclusivamente i più forti e fortunati.|`|SvEO8P71aa	mah... i pesciolini fanno le uova... e qnd sn nel mare cm fanno?! fanno da soli nn ti preoccupare!<br>  <br>  ciao ciao|`|a2ed3a98eb69c8d9892bffe61ac87a2caa	rivolgiti ad un consultorio familiare!|`|a4553b1a5197b822bc2fd40c59723d19aa	per sicurezza portalo in pronto soccorso|`|gDMPjRMfaa	Dovresti comperare in un negozio specializzato un contenitore per le uova,è un contenitore galleggiante che permette di proteggere le uova cosi non vengono divorate.|`|49cca780588fa28ef63925f17591a0b4aa	ke belle le prime tre battute mi avete fatto piaciare dalle risate!! lasciala partorire da sola e poi separa i "cuccioli" DALLA MAdre mettendoli in un altra vasca.|`|4MFEqeoaaa	dai una martellata sull`acquario cosi gli romperai le acque|`|68026fb6fc69f89bca94a31b6a5f2cfdaa	Ciao laiki,<br>  la risposta più sensata te l'ha data " dark " che si è preso la briga, x aiutarti, di trascrivere le informazioni che ha su un suo libro.

Restrict him to one or two rooms and go back to crate training for a couple weeks.

PBBdapCWaa	That can be a problem when breeding livebearers.  The only better solution is a second tank to put her in while she has the babies.

When I see one of my livebreeders getting about a week away i take the time out and move her to a smaller tank 5 gallons. their is a divider in it making it  2 =21/2 gallon sides. I took the insert from a breeder box and used ties to mount it to the side of one of the halfs. when she has the babies they go through the slit and end up in the tank and not in a breeder box bottom. they do not go back up throught the slit in the divider. when she is done i feed her and the babies in the half that babies are in. crushing the flake food to powder. this allows her to rest laying in the breeder divider. the babies also get food because the food falls right through the slit in the divider. about 6 hrs. later i move her to the other half of the tank where she will be alone for a day or so to rest and i have time to move her to the main tank with all the guys.<br>  It has taken me some time to remember how to do all this because i breeded guppies some 20 yrs ago. I found my book on how i did things.<br>  Make sure that you mark the calendar when she gave birth and exspect it to happen again in about 25-30 days.<br>  Remember stress kills. Make sure you do a water change once a month and dont over feed. over feeding cause bad water and fish to get to fat. Guppies can get feed once a week and still have plinty of food to eat for a week. If you are planning on having alot of fry set up a 5 gallon tank just for the fry. guppies like salt in the water too.|`|XRQHqDAVaa	i found that the best way to do it is just to watch the fish have the babies and everytime she has one catch it in a net and put it into another tank.|`|fe3a6b6a93cce1feb600e1b15958cacdaa	i had a frog that swam up and jumped over the top to eat my babies... so i had to get it another place to live...

1e7c2bac1aa643712df6de7f439f3edeaa	Turtles take ALOT of work & care for to do it properly. So do yourself some research & really plan it out beofre you decide to do this.  I know you have probably made up your mind in keeping it if u r on here askin so u will not listen to people saying to let it go.  It would be best for you to put it back where you found it. That is its environment & it is where it knows how to live.  BUT if u are keeping it again do what is right for it.  Since it is wild you will have to make it a wild habitat.  It is not a store bought, tank bred & raised animal.  You should think of making it a pond.  You 1st need atleast a gallon per inch of turtle, if buiding pond, @100 gallon is the smallest you should go, it needs room to grow & roam. ponds need to be ENCLOSED, a small little fence around it or it will escape. The pond needs pond plants for it to seek shelter as well as feed on. Floating plants, water lettuce, hyacinths, anacharis, or hornwort--all things they like to eat.  You can put some fish in it too. For food--rosie minnows are the best, least fatty, most nutritious, a few small goldfish too--itll eat them, not nutritious, but likes them.  maybe even buy some tadpoles & snails--they eat those too.  itll eat worms, crickets. It needs to eat in water, it cant digest food outside of water. Your pond will need a filter, a pump, some rocks, somewhere to bask in the sun--they love the sun, a big rock or you can buy a turtle dock. You need to watch the water that its not too hot not too cold, monitor it has not too much algae growing, all the right plants, some promote oxigination, some stop algae growth, others good for feeding.  Then depending where you live u may have to move them in for winter if u dont plan on them hibernating. so another whole set up for the winter, then you need heating lamps, uva/uvb bulbs they still need the sunlight--& keeping them clean! They harbor salmonella! Clean wate ris a must!  So it is expensive. u need to think about that.  If your ready to take on all the work, u can afford the start up costs & your in it for the long run go for it. They are beautiful fun little creatures--I really enjoy mine, but they are continuous work, as any pet.  heres a few sites, www.turtlesale.com there is a messageboard there its good, they give good info. also a pond store i buy from www.pondmegastore.com they give good info on what each type of plants do. good luck.|`|osrqpU2Taa	Hello..YOU don't take things from the wild..unless you want it to die or make you sick..not to mention it's USUALLY illegal to take some things from the wild, especially turtles..of any kind...wild animals, reptiles.aquatics especially carry diseases they are immune to but you,  your family, nor your pets are & sometimes all you have to do touch them one time & forget to wash your hands, anything meat eating usually carry salmonila too...go for captive breds..no wild creature would like to be taken & caged, any more then you would !!! Take Care :)|`|cxWWioNyaa	Turtles, especially a painted turtle, are one of the most easy pets to take care of. [my opinion] All you have to do is purchase an aquarium [ a fish aquarium is fine] and purchase turtle pellets. You can find these at any pet store or wal-mart. Make sure that the aquarium fits the turtle's size and it has room to swim. Also make sure that the turtle has a heater to keep the water warm [ also purachable at walmart/petstore] and something for it to climb out of the water on (something thats big enough for the turtle like a piece of wood.) Raising a turtle can be fun, and it also makes a very decorative peice of furnature if you put colorful extras in the aquarium and set it on a nice stand/table. Good Luck!|`|flP6qhkMaa	let it go back into the wild would be the best for the turtle, I know they are neat, but they are wild animals and will thrive in the wild and flounder in captivity|`|hcWlQO6xaa	<a href="http://www.petco.com/caresheets/turtles/Turtle_Painted.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.petco.com/caresheets/turtles/...</a> thats a short bit of info, do some research, you cant always rely on the answers thru here.

Ciao!|`|huQ9dBYCaa	beh i cavalli sono tutti belli io quando ho cominciato ad andare a cavallo dicevo che non avrei mai comprato un cavallo bianco o grigio e il mio primo cavallo era proprio GRIGIO!   in più dicevo anche che avrei sempre voluto un cavallo nero (o quasi) con la lista e balzano a quattro e la mia cavalla ci assomiglia molto non ha la lista ma ha il liscio tra i nari però devo anche dire che sono innamorata anche di molti altroi cavalli che sono di colori diversi....<br>  quaindi i cavalli come ho già detto sono tutti bellissimi e non conta assolutamente il colore ma il cuore che hanno......|`|0W4LfrZeaa	Mi fanno impazzire NERI o BIANCHI senza macchie e tirati a lucido......ma una persona che adora i cavalli come me li apprezza tutti il mio era baio bruciato quasi morello.....BELLISSIMI!!!!!|`|14Ae300Laa	Secondo me, decisamente NERI . Mi piace il riflettersi della luce del sole sul loro manto ...|`|zXyEuSzaaa	a me piacciono sia neri ke marroni!!!!!!!|`|41UloLnOaa	i cavalli sono tutti belli.. non importa il mantello, ma bisogna vedere nel cuore se sono belli.. conosco tanti cavalli che sono bellissimi ma sono veramente dei **********, io ho un cavallo a macchie!! un appaloosa, cavallo degli americani.. e lo chiamano cavallo di pippi  calzelunghe!!! è bello, ma è anche buono dentro, e bisogna avere fortuna per trovare un cavallo del genere, e via assicuro che all'inizio era birbante e tozzo..|`|4twcTsj5aa	neri mi sembrano più belli e maestosi!!!|`|A41MMO9xaa	scusa se preciso...i cavalli bianchi non esistono ma si chiamano grigi qualsiasi sia la loro tonalità, i neri si chiamano morelli, i marroni bai, i rossi sauri, poi c'è il roano (grigio baio sauro), l'ubero (sauro grigio), l'isabella (mantello beige con coda e criniera nera), il palomino (mantello beige con coda e criniera bionde), il pezzato, ecc. comunque il mio preferito è il baio|`|IdfBKDPhaa	ma secondo me non esiste una scelta assoluta: dipende dalla razza dell'animale: ad ex. l'andaluso  lo vedo solo bianco mentre un'ardennese(che è il mio preferito) nero sarebbe decisamente piu' bello di uno bianco o marrone.Un bel criollo? Un delitto non prenderlo pezzato..<br>  comunque se devo fare una scelta  secca dico marrone: si vede meno lo sporco<br>  Ciao, masoc.|`|KODd4bPjaa	io li preferisco color sauro, sauro bruciato e palomino.<br>  questo link che ti riporto indica i vari tipi di mantelli<br>  <a href="http://www.ilportaledelcavallo.it/enciclopedia/mantelli.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.ilportaledelcavallo.it/encicl...</a>|`|KUylCWZ3aa	allora prima di tutto non si dice bianco nero o marrone...ci sono i cavalli morelli (neri) , con il mantello baio (marrone scuro), sauro (marrone chiaro quasi rosso) e grigi....cmq i morelli sono i piu belli ma si vede subito se hanno anche un solo filo di polvere...i migliori sono i bai...dopo di pende se hanno strisce bianche sul muso o sulle gambe...(balzane)...e da come sono fatti...e da la si vede la loro bellezza!!|`|KvxHNFdQaa	marroni con la criniera e la coda nere...<br>  <br>  <br>  che belliiiiiiiiiii!!!<br>  oppure neri...|`|ONjlFx5xaa	ecco!! io ne ho uno paint horse!!<br>  e devo dire ke è incredibile..ti ricordo solo che non è importane tanto il fatto estetico (ma se ti piace marrone,nero o bianco, sn contenta x te) ma l'importante da guardare in un cavallo e ilcarattere e la capacità..=) io cn il mio ho fatto così !! in + il paint horse haanke il mantello bellissimo!! <br>  cmq ti consiglio il marrone, bianko si sporca subito e nero, con il caldo, il cavallo diventa insofferente!|`|PksZ88wSaa	bianki... + da favola IHIHI|`|SeTsLAc6aa	Io ho avuto una cavalla bianca.<br>  Il bianco è bello però si sporcano molto facilmente e spesso occorre proprio lavarli perchè con la striglia non viene via.<br>  Mi piacciono molto anche quelli neri corvini e i pezzati (marrone  bianco o nero e bianco)<br>  quelli marron, come li chiami tu (baio e sauro) non mi piacciono tanto, anche se alla fine dipende dal cavallo e dalla sua conformazione :)|`|TqjxguPoaa	VIOLA...è piu vivace..|`|UcT0NSzuaa	viola a pois blu la criniera fatta a cresta (verde) e la coda rizzata(lilla)<br>  wow wow wow wow wow wow wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  parlando seriamente neri cn la corporatura muscolosa...|`|XOkMq4d3aa	Adoro quelli bianchi con le macchie marroncine, mi danno un senso di libertà, di stato brado, perchè sono quelli americani che usavano i pellerossa e che non tenevano mai in condizioni pietose come tanti cavalli purtroppo sono stati tenuti fin dai tempi degli antichi...|`|bhnM0yZhaa	sinceramente di un cavallo bisogna vedere x prima cosa il carattere a me picciono da matti i pezzati ma il mio e' un arabo sauro !!!! l 'ho scelto x la sua dolcezza non x il colore!!!!|`|dSli2XV7aa	neri|`|qshKGeZaaa	mmm vediamo i kavalli sono belli tutti cmq se ne devo sceglie uno li preferisko o neri o bianki sono piu belli prendine uno nero ;)
