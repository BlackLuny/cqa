2BpkXSnqaa	A joint venture (often abbreviated JV) is an entity formed between two or more parties to undertake economic activity together. The parties agree to create a new entity by both contributing equity, and they then share in the revenues, expenses, and control of the enterprise. The venture can be for one specific project only, or a continuing business relationship such as the Sony Ericsson joint venture. This is in contrast to a strategic alliance, which involves no equity stake by the participants, and is a much less rigid arrangement.<br>  <br>  The phrase generally refers to the purpose of the entity and not to a type of entity. Therefore, a joint venture may be a corporation, limited liability company, partnership or other legal structure, depending on a number of considerations such as tax and tort liability.<br>  <br>  When are joint ventures used?<br>  <br>  Joint ventures are not uncommon in the oil and gas industry, and are often cooperations between a local and foreign company (about 3/4 are international). A joint venture is often seen as a very viable business alternative in this sector, as the companies can complement their skill sets while it offers the foreign company a geographic presence. Studies show a failure rate of 30-61%, and that 60% failed to start or faded away within 5 years. (Osborn, 2003) It is also known that joint ventures in low-developed countries show a greater instability, and that JVs involving government partners have higher incidence of failure (private firms seem to be better equipped to supply key skills, marketing networks etc.) Furthermore, JVs have shown to fail miserably under highly volatile demand and rapid changes in product technology.<br>  <br>  Some countries, such as the People's Republic of China and to some extent India, require foreign companies to form joint ventures with domestic firms in order to enter a market. This requirement often forces technology transfers and managerial control to the domestic partner.<br>  <br>  Another form joint ventures may take are the Joint Ventures (JV's) in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico dedicated to the conservation of priority bird species and their associated habitats. Each of these JV's is different in how they go about their respective missions, but all try to follow the principles of Strategic Habitat Conservation (SHC). SHC combines biological planning, conservation design, conservation delivery, and evaluation and monitoring. Gulf Coast Joint Venture, Lower Mississippi Valley Joint Venture, and Prairie Pothole Joint Venture are just three of the 20+ JV's found in North America.<br>  <br>  Brokers<br>  <br>  In addition, joint ventures are practiced by a joint venture broker, who are people that often put together the two parties that participate in a joint venture. A joint venture broker then often make a percentage of the profit that is made from the deal between the two parties.<br>  <br>  Reasons for forming a joint venture<br>  <br>  Internal reasons<br>     1. Build on company's strengths<br>     2. Spreading costs and risks<br>     3. Improving access to financial resources<br>     4. Economies of scale and advantages of size<br>     5. Access to new technologies and customers<br>     6. Access to innovative managerial practices<br>  Competitive goals<br>     1. Influencing structural evolution of the industry<br>     2.

Some papers with very broad scope trace a single topic over the entire course of history, or treat a single topic in every conceivable case.  Ideally, you will limit your scope to a certain time frame and certain situation. <br>  <br>  Some questions to help you limit scope:<br>  Are you referring to all erosion of Goleta beach ever, or just during a certain time period?  Maybe you only want to talk about erosion because of certain factors or relate erosion to another set of issues like environmental policy or turtle migration.

iptVbsgraa	*Try not to speak completely in first, ex. reminds me of.<br>  <br>  The book Among the Hidden can connect to several different books, for example, The Diary of Anne Frank and Charlotte's Web. Among the Hidden is similar to The Diary of Anne Frank because The Diary of Anne Frank was about a teenage Jewish girl, who hid from Nazis during the invasion of Holland. This relates to Among the Hidden because Luke was hiding from the population police and Anne also hid from the Nazis. In the setting of Among the Hidden, I was reminded of Charlotte's Web due to the surroundings of plains, trees, and farms. The plot was also based on a pig, who was saved by an eight year old girl, and almost got killed. Both the books Anne Frank and Among the Hidden is about a pre-teen hiding, and keeps one striving for more after each chapter. <br>  <br>  The beginning is still a little funky ...I just don't know what to do about it.
eb7939afceea213fb37cb6c2a376ba3faa	I found the beginnings of the novel to be dull and uninspired. However, I began to enjoy the book from its middle chapters to its climax. I particularly enjoyed the part of the book where he makes Jen's acquaintance and takes the opportunity  to sneak into her house unobserved .<br>  Because the chapters are so concise, the reader's interest is maintained to the end. However, because it delves into the realm of Science Fiction, I  feel little personal connection to Among The Hidden though, it lets me recall my past life, make comparisons with other books, and learn from the reality it presents.
jN8duTx2aa	A few colleges accept students through the spring, but the vast majority have deadlines between Dec and Feb.  Some schools accept freshman for the spring semester, but many more don't.<br>  <br>  It would be very difficult for you to apply for college next year.  If you want to, you need to take your SATs or ACTs by October at the latest.  Taking them that late will mean you only get one shot.  You'd also have to push through junior year work by November 1.  Schools are very unlikely to consider a student who claims they will finished over a year's work in 6 months.<br>  <br>  Honestly, I think 15 is way to young for college.  Most kids who graduate that young go to community college, but if I were you I'd wait to apply to college until Dec 09-Feb 10, enter in 2010.  Up your volunteer/extra curricular activities in the meantime.

"Your, your oen worst enemy".... i always thought that no one would want me in there schools but i learned that %66 of all freshmen drop out in there first semester so colleges get all that money for free so they take just about anyone because you just money to them and then after the list gets packed they start looking for people that will helpfull to school...... i hope this helps

7DuVshl5aa	It's grammatically correct, but you also have to take into account it's poetry, and the poet plays with the language.  You're right, it's definitely odd; it's written by a poet just trying to write like a fancy poet.  "Could" in the case just means the mind was about to do it.  It's difficult to know what "hold revel" means, it's a pretty cumbersome wording.  <br>  <br>  I take the sentence to mean literally" Amid such glowing beauty on a glorious September sunset in Fredericton, 1824, the mind was able to rejoice."  Basically, the poet to me seems to be celebrating a marvelous sunset.  But it's hard to know exactly not seeing the whole poem.

Jr6emga0aa	"Playboy" connotes someone who is not serious about a profession or much else, goes to a lot of parties and goes around with a variety of women.

LwywrSRkaa	Sounds like you need to brush up some social skills. You really do sound like a hard working and dedicated student. But like you said you know how to study does that mean you also understand what you're studying cos you say you're not smart? I think you should do some other things like go to clubs, do activities out of school, maybe go to a summer camp and so on. And studying is good of course! Knowledge is power lol! You'll need good study skills when you go to Uni and stuff. You said you might want to join the UN, well why not start training and so on and finding out as much as you can for your future? =) Good luck!|`|plOfDn2qaa	read all you can about economics, the more you study, the more you learn - keep up the good work, it will work out for you.

NbmnWwqEaa	Love is everywhere . . . <br>  There are different kinds of love, of course.<br>  <br>  Unconditional love is the best and most prevalent:<br>  <br>  The love God/The Universe has for us is said to be "unconditional" -- except religions make rules and ruin that theory.<br>  <br>  I, personally, believe God/The Universe (whatever you want to call it) loves us ALL (Jewish, Catholic, Mormon, Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, Athiest) unconditionally. Without conditions.<br>  <br>  Parents should love their children . . . unconditionally. Most of them do "love us" unconditionally. No matter what. Even some of the prisoner's in our jails have one parent that loves them unconditionally; no matter how heinous their crimes.<br>  <br>  Then, there's conditional love . . .which covers most of the other ones.<br>  Romantic love is conditional. You love someone because of what you think they will do with you, to you in a romantic way.  So, it is conditional.<br>  <br>  Love is not jealously or violence, though. And some people think it is . . .it is not.<br>  <br>  Loving someone, unconditionally or conditionally, means you want them to be happy -- even if it means it is without you.<br>  <br>  And the most important love of all is "self-love" which should be UNCONDITIONAL. To love yourself for exactly who you are . . . makes it easier for you to love others; because you have something to give to others.<br>  <br>  True love (also under unconditional) means, as I said before, "To love someone so much you want them to be happy . . . even if it means they are not with you."<br>  <br>  It also means, loving another person enough to "let them go" if they are abusing you. For your self-love means doing what is best for you; and wanting yourself to be happy, even if it without a person you love (because he/she is abusing you).<br>  <br>  To be willing to "die" for someone you love depends on the circumstance . . . for it usually falls under romantic love.<br>  <br>  Although, I'd throw myself in front of a bullet for a child or another human being as I have unconditional love for all people.<br>  <br>  I have learned, through the years . . . in romantic love. You first love has to be "self-love" or you have nothing to give the person you choose to love. You must fill up the cup, once in a while, to be able to pour out love to another.<br>  <br>  If there's nothing inside of you . . . for yourself, you have nothing to give to others. Thus, self-love means respecting and being kind to you. Recognizing your worth . . .so that another can see it, too . . . and knowing you deserve to be loved in return as you love.|`|cI0dF22yaa	I don't have any definition of love.<br>  Because I haven't even experienced it.|`|t3G5xSbIaa	love is compassion, truth, respect and most importantly the meaning to do anything even risk ur life for ur loved one!|`|tKKlhSgqaa	Love to me means that you care for that person more than anything else in the world. You would rather spend time with that person rather than anyone else. He makes you smile when your sad. He gives you butterflies. You feel so close to them even when you are saying nothing to each other. You hate to be mad at each other. You find your self smiling just thinking of them. Most of all you just love everything about them and you could never see your self with anyone else!|`|pmUHC95Yaa	maybe i'm not mature enough.<br>  love means a lot to me..<br>  To me my lover is top1.<br>  i really wanna change my mind.but i can't help..<br>  so far,my sweetheart is still my whole world,she's not like me though

AXiKJDV9aa	I don't know about your situation, but many moons ago when I was an undergrad the guys that did internships (I didn't bother because I had a full time job and attended part time) had an intern coordinator at their school to ensure they were treated fairly, not exploited, had reasonable working conditions, or other not on stuff.  You really need to take your concerns up with that person.  If he fired you because of it their is no way your college will penalize you in any way for it.  You cant let 'bully's' like that get away with it.  They basically rely on people not going to authorities about it. <br>  <br>  I don't know what it was like for you at school, but bully's feared snitches, which is why they claimed it was wrong to snitch.  Don't you snitch or I will beat you up (in this case fire you).  When you tell authority you will be surprised how quickly bully's back down - especially if you let then know should they retaliate then it will be worse for them.  I could tell you stories - but suffice to say my experience is you should never ever let them get away with it.  If your parents had a bit of money I would be inclined to take legal action.  I can tell you from experience that makes them run scared like you wouldn't believe.<br>  <br>  No ethical issues would prevent me from being brutally honest about it.<br>  <br>  Thanks<br>  Bill

Just think that younger less experienced teenagers have conceived a child before you but some never regret they had a child even though they were in school and had plans for the future.

Wonderful people who cannot conceive a child and would want to give your child a wonderful, loving, financially-stable secure home.<br>  <br>  Some of them offer open adoption . ..where you can write and get updates on the child you lovingly give to them. Or you can choose closed and leave your information for when the child is 18 and let him or her contact you.<br>  <br>  I urge you to consider that option, as well. And do what you feel is best.|`|AA11896905	well Hun, everyone has different views. I personally am against it. unless its medical, like the babe has a disease or was a rape baby. & you are not young!

Those without it will be behind the 8 ball from the start.  I don't like your chances unless you do it.<br>  <br>  My advice is to go carefully through college-board for all the colleges you are interested in and make sure you do the subjects that will give you the best chance of admission.  That means you should do at least their recommended preparation.<br>  <br>  Thanks<br>  Bill|`|ql61myroaa	My roommate is an admissions counselor at College of the Holy Cross and he said that top tier colleges will look to see if you are taking the most challenging classes available.  They have a quick eye for reading transcripts and are quite familiar with the academic offerings at specific high schools so they can quickly identify applicants who appear to be avoiding the tough classes and this will work against you for the top colleges.  He said they would prefer you tackle the tough classes and get a B than take a gut class and get an A which doesn't tell them anything.  You also must meet all required classes for each school or you will automatically be set aside unless you are an underepresented minority.
ccEWxExfaa	Although they both mean generally the same,<br>  homage implies public acknowledgment of honor,<br>  and tribute implies a gift,payment or declaration of<br>  praise.So it would depend on which meaning comes<br>  closest to what you want to convey.<br>  Generally speaking the word "homage" is more formal.|`|6DFhlt4daa	tribute<br>  <br>  A gift, payment, declaration, or other acknowledgment of gratitude, respect, or admiration: put up a plaque as a tribute to his generosity.<br>  Evidence attesting to some praiseworthy quality or characteristic: Winning the scholarship was a tribute to her hard work.<br>  <br>  A payment in money or other valuables made by one ruler or nation to another in acknowledgment of submission or as the price of protection or security.<br>  A tax imposed for such payment.<br>  Any payment exacted for protection.<br>  <br>  A payment or tax given by a feudal vassal to an overlord.<br>  The obligation to make such a payment.<br>  [Middle English tribut, from Old French, from Latin tribūtum, from neuter past participle of tribuere, to pay, distribute, from tribus, tribe. See tribe.]<br>  <br>  A tribute (from Latin tribulum, contribution) is wealth one party gives to another as a sign of respect or, as was often case in historical contexts, of submission or allegiance. It also incorporated certain aspects of regulated trade in goods and services between the parties under a contractual relationship formed upon duress, and based upon the potential for threats if specific performance did not occur. A tributary or tributary state is a state, colony, region, or people who pay tribute to a more powerful, suzerain state.<br>  <br>  Various ancient states, which could be called suzerains, exacted tribute from areas they had conquered or threatened to conquer. In case of alliances, lesser parties gave tribute to the dominant parties as a sign of allegiance and for the purposes of financing the agreed projects - usually raising an army. The term may also be used on religious tax used for maintenance of temples and other sacred places.<br>  <br>  Athens received tribute from the other cities of the Delian League. Empires of Assyria, Babylon, Carthage and Rome exacted tribute from their provinces and subject kingdoms. Ancient China received tribute from various states such as Japan, Korea, and Vietnam.

In this sense, a reference within a creative work to someone who greatly influenced the artist would be an homage. It is typically used to denote a reference in a work of art or literature to another, at least somewhat widely known, work. In literature and film, an homage is similar to an allusion, except that whereas an allusion merely refers to another work, a homage typically repeats a recognizable scene or stylistic element from the other work. Homage is also similar to parody, except that parodies typically exaggerate characteristics of previous works for comedic effect.<br>  <br>  Homage may occasionally be perceived negatively by critics as a technique often associated with amateur creators.

n2O0NwR6aa	It's easiest to explain using an example:<br>  <br>  In this family, Jane and John and brother and sister.  Their children, Sue and Sam, are 1st cousins to each other.

For example, Sue and Fern are 1st cousins "once removed" - because there's one generation separating them.  Sue and Beth would be 1st cousins twice removed - because they're 2 generations apart.  Fred and Beth would be 2nd cousins once removed - they're second cousins, but 1 generation removed from each other.|`|1cc3e8f1fd4f8f463a086308722eb160aa	Here is an explanation of all cousins.

tCsFxh5Aaa	When we traveled the world, we didn't see the need to comply with education laws of places that we visited for a week or two or three.  After all, if you are vacationing somewhere for 3 weeks, you don't worry about putting your child into school there.  Why would it be any different if you are visiting lots of different places?   Homeschooling is perfect for such situations.<br>  <br>  When we did this, my parents bought correspondence course materials from the country where we were living, but they didn't send in the lessons since we were traveling constantly.  Rather, they checked the material themselves and made sure we were learning.  They kept the materials to show as proof that we had been getting an education, in case anyone ever asked.  The only time they ever needed to show someone was when we settled down and they wanted to put us back in school.<br>  <br>  Residency requirements vary from place to place.  Often it is living somewhere 30 days in one place or taking a job there that makes you considered a permanent resident somewhere (but  a month in a state wouldn't necessarily make you a resident if you have several addresses during that time or are living in a hotel or a motorhome or something).<br>  <br>  Do you need a permanent address?  Not really.  It is good to have an address of a relative or friend that you can use when needed, especially for bills and such, if you need it.  But we had no permanent address for over 2 years and did quite well.  We eventually settled in a different country and had no problems with school officials accepting our homeschooled work as proof that we could go right into the age-appropriate grade level.<br>  <br>  Make sure to let your child make the most of the learning opportunities available from traveling.  Visit lots of historical places.  Get to know the locals and see how things are different (and the same) as in other places.  Look at maps and such to learn geography as you travel.  Have fun with it.|`|MoaIQPvCaa	Do you have proof that you are a resident of another state? Have you kept his school work for the year?

Nursing attendant was to Princess Alexandra's RAF hospital Halton in Buckinghamshire. <br>  On my arrival at surgical ward I was met by senior nursing sister, Shirley Hubble: "Have got a special for you, Carroll," she advised, "Pio Grech - arrived last night, flown over from Malta by air ambulance. <br>  <br>  Urgent Care Express<br>  Arizona's Best! Chandler/Gilbert, Mesa, Florence and Queen Creek.<br>  www.UrgentCareExpress.com<br>  TeamHealth<br>  Leader in emergency medicine and hospitalist staffing and management<br>  www.teamhealth.com<br>  Mobile Specialty Vehicles<br>  Units for Law Enforcement, Fire, Healthcare, Government, Display<br>  www.msvglobal.com<br>  "A real sad case is this, Pio is a Maltese from Valletta. He is a civilian who was working under the jurisdiction of a British service contract. Employed as a driver he was transporting canisters of sulphuric acid when he crashed and overturned on a steep hill, fracturing one of the canisters which, literally, poured over him from head to toe. You'll specialise during the day, we need to keep constant watch." <br>  Reading the notes I saw this case was going to be a challenge. Halton RAF hospital was equipped with the latest technology. Staff were chosen to match that technology. Sister directed me to the screened area in the main surgical ward and pulled back the curtains. <br>  "Good morning, Pio," she announced brightly. "I'm introducing you to nurse Peter." <br>  I winced when I saw Pio. Sister removed and replaced each dressing. He had horrendous burns. Must of the extremities were absent or severely damaged. Pio had also been blinded in the accident, his eyes severely damaged, the outer covering of flesh burnt away. <br>  Pio responded with a slight head movement and an attempted smile. What was left of the flesh and muscle surrounding his mouth was taught and raw but he was able to issue a sound and move his tongue. <br>  "Fortunately, Pio speaks English quite well," Sister advised, "his hearing is fairly good but you will have top speak up. <br>  "Because the skin nerve fibres were burnt he suffers little pain, he has some feeling in his finger tips though. You will need to change his dressings twice a day, he is constantly losing body fluid and you will see he is on a saline and plasma drip." <br>  Sister gave me an optimistic smile: "He's all yours, Carroll. I know you can cope," she encouraged. "Doctor Richer will be doing the rounds this morning, apparently they sent him out to Malta to pick up Pio, he specialises in burns, it's his first day at Halton." <br>  I drew up a chair to the bedside and made myself comfortable. I had to get to know my patient, to reassure him that he was in good hands. <br>  "Okay?" <br>  I saw Pio's blinded eyes flicker as he responded with a delicate movement<br>  <br>  of the tongue. I was able to understand that. <br>  "Yes, I'm okay, Pio. How are you feeling?" <br>  Over the next few days I was able to quickly adjust to the treatment and needs of my patient. It soon became evident that Pio was aware of the extremity of his injuries, but did not crave for or want pity. Doctor Richer said it was a miracle that he was still alive and he must be blessed with a tough resilience and willpower. <br>  <br>  CoDependency 5 Days<br>  Intensive Program for those impacted by addiction (877)742 HERO<br>  www.aherosjourney.com/<br>  Disney World?<br>  Buy 4 Nights, Get 3 Free with park tickets!

He was soon the most popular patient in the ward and the other patients admired and respected him. They teased him about hogging the female night nurse all to himself but he took it all in good heart. <br>  In the next couple of weeks Pio's condition worsened. He was still losing body fluid and the saline and plasma drips were stepped up. Due to the inability to move his lower jaw Pio was on a feeder tube. The whole ward was a quieter place now. We feared the worst. <br>  The hospital psychologist felt certain Pio's extraordinary mental resources would pull him through but he needed something to spur him on. <br>  The plastic surgeon and the eye specialist were ready to start work on Pio. With a skin loss of eighty per cent there were limitations on how far to go. If Pio gained strength the eye corneas could be replaced. <br>  The answer came in the post the following morning: Pio's brother was flying over from Sicily. I could see the joy on his face when I told him. He wanted yo shake hands with me but his was too fragile, he had two movable fingers on his right hand. I interlocked them with my own right index fingers. "Let's shake on it," I laughed. <br>  It was to become our own method of greeting.

Often times research which disproves something is not as appealing or glitzy as new research which demonstrates something new.

My old professor told me that a good rule of thumb for research material is not to use anything older than 5-7 years, but at the very oldest 10 years old.<br>  <br>  Who wrote the article - This is especially true for an internet source. The internet allows any joe somebody to put their opinions out there for anyone and everyone to see.<br>  <br>  Where the research was conducted - Where was the research conducted is a good indication of the validity of the source. <br>  <br>  The references that the article cites - What are some of the other resources that the article shows. Would they be valid in your research as well.
45a2d78be5d5ed4c4b9533acffae073baa	Well, since I don't want to rewrite the whole thing in order to make corrections, I'll just offer a few suggestions.<br>  1)  You have a lot of short sentences that can be combined to make the story flow better.  For instance: " I was fifteen, living in Naples, and school had just let out that Tuesday which meant that I had a three day weekend."  There are times when you can include a short sentence when you want to draw special attention to the idea being stated.  <br>  2)  The old man "lay there" not "lye here."<br>  3)  Watch for capitalization, spelling, and punctuation.<br>  4)  Lose the "had" in "A policemant had told me."<br>  5)  "My senses were keen to the slightest movement.  There were angry voices coming from the alley so we ducked behind an abandoned car in an effort to hide from the group as they walked by in a rush."  If you say "My senses keen to the slightest movement." than you will have to add more to the sentence to explain what is happening with your senses, such as:  "My senses, keen to the slightest movement, made me aware of the angry voices coming from the alley."  "We ducked behind an abandoned car in an effort to hide from the group as they walked by in a rush."<br>  6)  "I could feel the sweat drip down my brows as I tasted blood in my mouth.  I felt adreneline rush through my veins as the smell of sweet victory, flowing in the calm night breeze, hit my face."  Or "Sweat dripped down my brows, I tasted blood in my mouth, and I felt adreneline rush through my veins as the smell of sweet victory, flowing in the clam night breeze, hit my face."  Again, watch for sentence fragments and punctuation.  <br>  7)  Don't use too many "ands" in a sentence unless you have a special reason for it.  Use punctuation such as commas instead.  <br>  Of course you don't have to take any of these ideas.  Sorry I couldn't do more but it's getting late and I have to go to bed.    <br>  You have a good story and you are telling it very well.  You just need to clean up the technical parts to make it read more coherently.

CrAwmz65aa	This is just a story, but I have heard about a student who was denied admittance to a graduate school because of his GRE scores.<br>  He ran a study which found that there was no significant correlation between GRE scores and graduate school grades.<br>  He then submitted the results of that study to the school.<br>  The school was impressed both with the results of the study and with the student's display of diligence in conducting that study, so they admitted him.
Vd1OzUO8aa	I know this is cliche, but my secret is to take as good as notes as I can.  So that when it's time to take exams everything is written out and it reduces my overall time to study.  I usually spend a full day studying for every exam.  (I just finished two).  I push myself to get at least 70% on the essays, and 90% on the exam.  This usually equals out to higher than 80% when all is said and done, and I end up with an A or A- in the course; not too shabby in the end.<br>  <br>  It all comes down to memorizing everything I can for the exam.  For the essays I've found it best not to do anything fancy, like don't try to bring forth weird concepts or ideas that you can't back up.  Make sure you do everything that the essay asks you to do, so you don't lose dumb marks.  Like if it asks for specific instances from a work or from a time period that backs up what you say, make sure you include them.  In fact in general, its always best to add examples to back up your work.  It looks better that way.  Like say if you are comparing the style of paintings from different eras, give specific works of art to compare, don't just make generalizations.  Many people don't make the effort to find these specific things.  <br>  <br>  Also, I've found now that every teacher has their own system of doing footnotes, endnotes or sources (whatever you want to call them.)<br>  As stupid as it sounds, I lost several marks on an essay I just did, using the system of notation that another teacher said was acceptable for the university.  I check now with every teacher to make sure that they like both the style of writing and the type of notation style I use.  Some teachers kind of have this arrogance about them, that they want it only their way, and they think their way is the only correct way.  Also make sure your writing matches the course.  For instance, a history essay requires a more serious tone than an english one, and especially something like a geography or math one.<br>  <br>  Overall, I guess I'd just agree that you are paying for this.  It is very hard to get a second chance in life to go through it all again (as I am doing now.)|`|067b2baa55e77757acd3ddad50ffa2beaa	What a great question!...My secret to success at the university level was to understand why I was there and never lose sight of that.

trKgx3Ukaa	I am a third year civil engineering/law student ( plus I work three days a week). Time management is the key. Here is what works for me:<br>  <br>  1. Make a study schedule for each day/night: list exactly what topics you will cover in the hours you have set for the day. Stick to that, unless there is no way around it, and in that case just reschedule that topic for the next available day. <br>  <br>  2. Leave at least one day or half a day a week ( say Saturday or Sunday) free for any catch up you might have to do from the preceding week. <br>  <br>  3. Start all assignments as soon as you get them and schedule the times that you will work on them. Don't waver from this schedule except for hell or high water incidents. <br>  <br>  4. Make every study session productive. Ensure you have set yourself achievable goals for that session, and do your utmost to aim for those goals. Don't feel defeated if sometimes it just doesn't work out. It's OK, we all have bad days or just get stuck on a problem. Put it aside and tackle it another specific day, or ask for help from fellow students or your lecturer. <br>  <br>  5. Reward your hard and disciplined work with whatever your favorite activity might be. <br>  <br>  Effective and productive use of time, will save you heaps of time. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

iEExVH1eaa	Interesting and refreshing concept.<br>  <br>  One method is by examining a specific element of the book that is not primary to the theme. For example, one might look at the images of agriculture contained in Of Mice and Men and The Lord of the Rings. Likewise, you could look at the author's use of animals, alcohol, music references --- really no limitation, and the theme not need be central to the stories, although it could be. I once did a critical essay on the image of world-building in Larry Niven's "Protector" novel and the Biblical story of Genesis. You might also use the author's treatment of a non-English language within the text; two Japanese-Canadian authors, Hiromi Goto and Joy Kogawa, both include some elements of Japanese language in their novels "The Kappa Child" and "Obasan", but while one offers an English translation of items spoken in Japanese, one does not. It's possible to analyze the implications of this and the stylistic effect, as well as the impact on a non-Japanese speaking reader.|`|OTvSnO7naa	You could try cover art or maybe the country they're set in.  I suppose you could connect they by the fact they're both written in the same language or count the number of times a particular word is used and produce some sort of complex mathematical formula.<br>  <br>  There's a reason you compare books by theme - it makes sense.  Make your essay interesting by doing a professional job, not by using a gimmick. <br>  <br>  Characters, go for characters!  Both books will probably have men and women in them........|`|mSFLNznxaa	Be persistant I guess.<br>  I suggest the Twilight saga books, very addicting!

cQ6UFMmyaa	Depends on your learning program. If I were you, I would order the Rosetta Stone program for learning German. I have learned two languages and am very good at them thanks to said program. I strongly recomend it to anyone at all. The only downside is it costs roughly 150-200 dollars.

98k1nnl9aa	If you qualified in the UK and have Qualified Teacher Status then you are able to teach any subject to any age group.  However, I can't imagine you'd be successful in finding a PE teaching post if you've no coaching qualifications.  There are many well-qualified, unemployed PE teachers out there, so I'd be surprised if you were able to secure a job over someone who trained specifically as a PE teacher.

AA10067221	--What are the effects of light and darkness on ants?<br>  To test the effect of light and darkness on ants, you may want to have two observatories for this experiment. Place 25 ants into each observatory. Keep one observatory in the dark for a specified amount of time (4 weeks). Keep the other observatory in the light during the same time period. Note the differences in how much work has been done (tunnels dug, dirt mounds built, etc...) at the end of each day. Draw conclusions based on your experiment. <br>  *Your Hypothesis should answer these questions: <br>  Are ants affected by light and darkness? If so, how? Why do you think this is the case? <br>  <br>  --What types of food do ants prefer?<br>  To test the ants reaction to different foods, try placing different kinds of food into your observatory and see what the ants do. Do they prefer certain foods? Some good foods to try are sugar, salt, citrus fruit, green vegetables, meats, granola. Make conclusions based on the results of your experiment to determine if ants have particular taste preferences.<br>  *Your Hypothesis should answer these questions: <br>  What kind of foods do ants like/dislike? Why?  Do you think their preferences for certain types of food are based on taste alone, or is the texture of the food types also a factor? <br>  <br>  --Does music affect your appetite? <br>  Weigh your food before and after each dinner and change the music each night. Do this for one month and see which kind of music resulted in you eating the most amount of food. (You could do this experiment in a variety of ways by substituting music with other factors that could have an affect on your appetite, including color of the table cloth, the size of the utensils/plates, the presence of a TV, the amount of light in the room, and the presence of other people.)<br>  <br>  --What popular brand of soda afftects our teeth the most?<br>  Test four different teeth in four different popular beverages for a month to see the effects each beverage has on the tooth.

Do Humming Birds prefer certain colors over others?  What colors are Humming Birds most and least attracted to?<br>  (You could test this by placing several different colored bird feeders in various areas where Humming Birds frequent and measure and record the amount of sugar water that is left in the feeder at the end of each day.  Run the test for 4 weeks and determine if color was a factor in the Humming Birds' attraction to the feeder.)<br>  <br>  --How are different soils affected by erosion?

AA10401458	A geologic map is a special-purpose map made for the purpose of showing subsurface geological features. In the United States, geologic maps are usually superimposed over a topographic map (and at times over other base maps) with the addition of a color mask with letter symbols to represent the kind of geologic unit, stratigraphic contour lines, fault lines, strike and dip symbols, and various additional symbols as indicated by the map key.<br>  <br>  The color mask denotes the exposure of the immediate bedrock, even if obscured by soil or other cover. Each area of color denotes a geologic unit or particular rock formation (as more information is gathered new geologic units may be defined). However, in areas where the bedrock is overlain by a significantly thick unconsolidated burden of till, terrace deposits, loess deposits, or other important feature, these are shown instead.<br>  <br>  The stratigraphic contour lines are drawn on the surface of a selected deep stratum, so that they can show the topographic trends of the strata under the ground. It is not always possible to properly show this when the strata are extremely fractured, mixed, in some discontinuities, or where they are otherwise disturbed.<br>  <br>  Strike and dip symbols consist of (at minimum) a long line, a number, and a short line which are used to indicate tilted beds. The long line is the strike line, which shows the true horizontal direction along the bed, the number is the dip or number of degrees of tilt above horizontal, and the short line is the dip line, which shows the direction of tilt.<br>  <br>  Whereas topographic maps are produced by the United States Geological Survey in conjunction with the states, geologic maps are usually produced by the states.

Skipping it would put you at a disadvantage, and honors Algebra should offer you a challenge eventually.<br>  <br>  You are correct in assuming there will be some review involved for you.

Too bad about losing a scholarship, but maybe you wouldn't? Talk to the organization who gave you the scholarship; maybe they would be willing to hold it for you. Never hurts to ask.<br>  <br>  However, don't knock the art degree because there are many things that can be done with an art degree if that is where your passion lies. If it isn't, then switch to something that does make you happy but don't needlessly rip on something just because it doesn't seem to be the best fit for you.<br>  <br>  One thing to consider is that even though you are down on the art degree now, at one point you obviously thought it was a great idea. Learn from that and don't jump into a new direction without asking a few more tough questions and having a good idea of what you are getting yourself into.

During the times of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth the flag featured both symbols of Poland and of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, though in fact there was little need for a state flag in a modern sense. Most of the military units flown the flags of their lands or founders (usually featuring coat of arms) and only the royal regiments used the royal standards. Some of the detachments however adopted the red and white stripes as their symbol. The shapes however often differed.<br>  <br>  The situation changed in 19th century, during the partitions of Poland, when Polish patriots required an easily-recognizable flag that could be used both for identification of troops on the battlefield and as a symbol of the state. On February 7, 1831 during the November Uprising, the Sejm decided that national colours of Poland are those of Coat of Arms of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, that is white above red. However, after the fall of the uprising the official flag of Congress Kingdom was changed back to that of the tsars of Russia.<br>  <br>  After Poland regained her independence in 1918, there was a considerable controversy over the adoption of a state flag. The coat of arms was obvious as it has been in use for roughly 900 years, however there were several possible versions of the flag. Finally, on August 1, 1919, the Sejm adopted the white and red flag at its current shape. Since the same shape and colours were used by port authorities around the world for harbour pilots and tugboats, the same act of the parliament adopted a variation of the flag with the coat of arms of Poland placed in the middle of the white stripe. The latter version was used as the Civil ensign for the merchant marine and by the diplomatic service abroad.<br>  <br>  Since then the flag of Poland remained almost the same, with the exception of colour changes introduced twice (see below). At the same time, the version with the coat of arms changed several times, in accordance with the changes applied to the coat of arms itself. In 1927 a new design of the White Eagle was introduced. Between 1928 and 1938 the flag with the coat of arms served solely as the flag of the Polish merchant marine, after which it was again introduced as a flag of Polish diplomatic service.[7] After the war the new communist regime removed the crown from the Eagle’s head and replaced (perhaps accidentally) the rosettes on its wings with stars, a change that was applied also to the flag. The changes were confirmed by the decree of December 7, 1955. It also extended the use of the flag with coat of arms to civil aviation (airports and civilian planes while abroad). The act of 1980 added port authorities to the list. The crown was reintroduced in 1990, and the current version is basically the same as that of 1927, with minor cosmetic changes.<br>  <br>  <br>  The act of 1919 did not specify the exact shade of the red colour featured on the Polish flag. In a 1921 pamphlet issued by the Polish Ministry of Military Affairs[8] all the state flags and symbols used the crimson red. The possible reason might have been that following 17th century the crimson was one of the most expensive dyes and was used by the magnate families and rich szlachta for their garments. The tradition was later adopted by various military formations (for instance, the soldiers of the Bar Confederation) who wore distinctive crimson coats, serving a similar role to the British red coats. On December 13, 1928 the President of Poland officially settled the controversy by ruling that the correct shade is rather vermilion. The shade was in use until 1980, when a need arose to better describe the correct colour using scientific description rather than traditional names. On January 31, 1980 a new act of the Polish parliament described the colour using the CIELUV standard.

Make sure that when you transfer those credits, it is into a regionally accredited school, so you'll be able to be professionally licensed down the road.

Be sure you are addressing the job requirements.  But given your age, the job options will likely be entry level with no special needs.  In that case, you want to emphasize your strengths.  <br>  <br>  If you already have employment experience or an impressive list of voluntary service responsibilities -- put them first.  If not, but your grades are solid, go with education/honors first.

1eb12276dbdaa05173fd144fb2aafa2aaa	NYU and USC are both considered to be the top film schools. When I was looking at going into film (which was about 5 years ago) UW-Milwaukee's Peck School of the Arts was good for experimental film. Also, you may look at Loyola Marymount, Fordham's Lincoln Center Campus, UCLA, Emerson, the University of Arizona, and the University of Texas at Austin's RTF program.  These are all well respected film schools though I have no idea how thay are in post-production specifically.<br>  <br>  A word of caution about editing (and film school in general): Equipment is very expensive (especially editing equipment), so even the best schools are notoriously out of date and under-equipped. Some schools post their available equipment online or will tell you if you ask. This will give you an idea of what you'll be working with, which is important as one of the reasons to go to film school is to have access to the equipment. <br>  <br>  Also, look at how the programs are structured. Some do not officially let you into the program until you have submitted a portfolio (or reel) at the end of your sophomore year. Some will let everyone and their dog make a film but will offer absolutely no help funding projects. Others give generous funding to one or two people but everyone else is relegated to crew positions. all of these systems have their advantages and disadvantages. Any one may work out for you (especially if you just want to edit as this will be less competitive than directing), but be aware of how the programs work and it will help direct you to the school that's right for you.<br>  <br>  Finally, you may want to look into getting AVID certified. This will mean you meet industry standards in editing. It costs a prettty penny though. They do, however, have some free online resources on their website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.avid.com/community/education/index.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.avid.com/community/education/...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps and best of luck.

The only thing I would add:<br>  <br>  Metaphors have a poetic quality -- they are less formal, stylistic imagery.  <br>  <br>  Similes can be used in poetry, but are less successful in that venue.  They are more aptly used in formal language and situations where too much poetic language would be inappropriate.

AA11372672	Drinking water can come through a variety of sources:<br>  Rain<br>  Lakes<br>  Glaciers<br>  Rivers <br>  Groundwater<br>  Sea<br>  These are the most common sources. <br>  For all of them, before they can be consumed, they must be purified to water standards in the region. For seawater, it must first go to desalination plant where the water is evaporated so the salt is removed. <br>  <br>  And for all of this, water that you are drinking may have been consumed several thousands of years earlier. How it works is that after you drink the water it goes through, you take a bathroom break and its released somewhere on the earth. Then the sun evaporates it, the clouds condense it, and it rains back down. Finally the water gathers somewhere like a lake or river and then it is collected. After being used, the whole cycle starts again.

Strip the insulation off of the ends about 3/4 in.  Connect the positive (+) end to the battery (but don't do the negative (-) one yet). Push the nails through the styrofoam, about 2 in apart.  Glue or tape the styrofoam to the board.  Connect the other end of that (+) wire to a nail.  Now take another wire (a different one) and connect it to the other nail, then back to the (-) terminal of the battery (but still don't connect it yet).  Now take a sharp knife (be careful) and cut a small piece of the insulation off of the wire BEFORE the nail on the (+) wire (about 2 in long).  Do the same thing to the (-) wire AFTER the nail.  Try to make it so the 2 pieces with the insulation cut off are close together.  Now take a pair of scissors and cut some very thin (about the width of a toothpick if you can) pieces of tinfoil, long enough to go between the nails and wrap around the nail a few times.  Attach one of you pieces of tinfoil to the nails.  Now connect the (-) wire to the battery....nothing should happen, and this is GOOD !  Now, take a screwdriver or something metal, and lay it across BOTH of the bare parts of the wires (where you cut off the insulation), and WATCH THE FOIL !  It should melt, and break the connection (circuit)...you have just made a FUSE !  When you create a "shirt-circuit" the fuse breaks the flow of electricity.  HINT:  If your foil doesn't melt, it's either A) too thick, B) battery is dead or too low of current, or C) you didn't connect the wires correctly.<br>  <br>  Add  a lightbulb and a switch to make it really cool !  The switch turns on and off the electricity like in your house, and the light bulb goes on when you throw the switch, and off when the fuse blows....<br>  <br>  Have fun and good luck !

nHhQhqvGaa	The name may be putting you off.  Try thinking of it as "Timeless Literature" or "The root of a story that we have in common!"  The thing that classic literature has in common is that once you decipher it, (harder sometimes than other times) you often find a conflict that you have had, or are likely to have.  That's why an old mothball of a play like Shakespeare's "Taming of the Shrew" can end up as a modern motion picture "Ten Things I Hate About You!"  Bernstein's "West Side Story is only a thinly disguised retelling of Romeo and Juliet.  The fact that you can get insight into the attitudes and customs of another time is also valuable, but even that wouldn't make a story worth reading all over the world!  Sometimes seeing a problem in a foreign setting actually makes it clearer, and sometimes just the novelty of the character helps us to be able to "swallow" the idea which has otherwise eluded us.  Take a look at the credits of some of your favorite movies and find out how many of them came from those dusty dry "Classics!"  Even George Lucas gave credit to the director of an earlier film, "The Seven Samurai" when he came up with "Star Wars!"  Sometimes researching the history of an idea or conflict, helps you to resolve it in your own life.  Sometimes it just makes you a wiser, well rounded person, and sometimes it just opens you up to worlds you never would have discovered any other way!  (It also makes you extremely interesting to talk to when you are around people who can seriously help you out with scholarships, grants, jobs, favors etc.)|`|b3d4065d5f3362225e7b5177e39da359aa	Not only is it important to learn the timeless lessons that classic literature offers, but reading these works is fantastic mental exercise. We must keep our minds limber by presenting them constantly with new challenges, and sometimes classic novels can be quite the challenge indeed. <br>  <br>  Also, it is essential that as part of a society we educate ourselves on the work of humanity. Writing is a primary vehicle for philosophical discussion and societal evaluation. How can we create something new if we are unaware of what has come before us?|`|41ee57b2143cb28d55c42bac1bb058c6aa	Dear Lord this cant be a real question.

082df5a738ab07d928d8eaff1fe24919aa	Take the full ride.  Many employers won't care where your degree came from, especially if you make the most of your education.  Demonstrate that you have made the most of your education by taking every opportunity to write and publish and be involved in other journalistic opportunities.  <br>  <br>  In other words, don't major in journalism and then spend your time getting tan, getting drunk and getting - well, sexually experienced.  Build a resume while you are in college.<br>  <br>  That said, I spent ten years paying off my undergraduate degree and all these years later, I consider it the best money that I've ever spent.  Look at both programs.  What do they each offer?  IS the Northwestern debt $7500 per year, or total over the four years?  Even at $30,000 debt after college, that is just about the cost of a car.  A more expensive car than I have ever bought, but most people wouldn't think much of spending that on  a car. My friend spent that much on her daughter's wedding.  <br>  <br>  Debt for your education is not like debt for a car or a wedding.  A car is going to lose at least 20% of its value the moment that you drive it off the lot, and if you miss payments, it can be repossessed.  50% of marriages end in divorce, so that's a lot of $$$ down the toilet.  No one can ever take your education away from you once you have it.   The cost of your education is an investment in your life.  <br>  <br>  Remember that more expensive doesn't always equal better.  Decide what YOU want, and examine the two schools and their offers to you in that light.  Then make a decision and quit sweating it.  <br>  <br>  With the offers that you have received, you obviously have a brilliant future ahead of you.<br>  <br>  I'd wish you good luck, but I think you're going to make your own luck!|`|38ogDZRIaa	You should come to Purdue...it's the best|`|ENIpbuTgaa	You should go tto Richmond because they gave you a full scholarship.

GPBJOH2Vaa	Yes, but some schools will not consider "mix and match" scores.  Check with the schools you're applying to to find out what their policies are.|`|xBhzMK3Paa	If I remember correctly, you take the writing section first, so it may be hard to skip.  Scores are also reported by sets and your non-score on the analytical writing section would show up when you sent scores to whoever you are sending scores to.|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	What do you mean, again?  The GRE has always had three sections.  Before they added the writing section, they had an analytic section instead.  I don't remember there ever being a '2 sections only' option.|`|eec61b9791496ca2bff48e78593ac3beaa	Absolutely 100% no way.  You do not get to pick and choose which scores in which sections you get to submit to grad school.    If you elect to retake the test, you retake the entire test, and you submit the entire score.  <br>  <br>  And if I remember correctly, you cannot opt to submit the scores once you've looked at them.  In other words, the total score is submitted to the university at the same time you find out your score, so if you bomb the second test, there's no recalling the scores - they're already submitted.

DjXzaHiqaa	They aren't, unless you count the pressure on professors to publish & be counted as experts in their fields.<br>  <br>  If anything, your quarrel should be with the textbook manufacturers.  There are so many different textbook options available per subject that it's expensive to produce them (think mass market paperbacks, but in reverse.)  I'm not sure if it would be a good thing for more consolidation of textbook choices, but it would definitely drive down costs.  There's also pressure on publishers to do very frequent revisions, which further drives up costs.|`|GPBJOH2Vaa	Sometimes school bookstores are locked into agreements with certain book vendors (Barnes and Noble is a big one lately), so they have to deal with costs like overhead and profit.

8kuqZPSBaa	Hi,<br>  I have been freelancing for almost 20 years and what I have learned is that Medill School of Journalism in Illinois is a great place to go to school. Why? Because one of the best newspapers in the nation, the Chicago Tribune, actively recruits new graduates from this school to work for their newspaper. There are also internships available, and they always seem to take Medill graduates to fill those internships. I have freelanced for many years for the Tribune and wish I would have gone to Medill simply because I've seen how many doors are opened to Medill graduates.<br>  <br>  I, myself, graduated from Northern Illinois University and majored in English, not journalism. I don't know of good schools in Texas or Indiana, but if you decide on Illinois, make it Medill! Hope this helps you. Stefanie Dell'Aringa, West Dundee, IL

Which should it be ?|`|TYJjicBqaa	1.<br>  f(-4)=(5/-4)+2<br>  f(-4)=-5/4 +2<br>  f(-4)=-5/4 +8/4<br>  f(-4)=(-5+8)/4<br>  f(-4)=3/4<br>  .........................................<br>  you will do exactly the same work for the other values given.in the place of x you will put the value given and you will find the result.<br>  in the last,you will put in the position of x the m-2.<br>  <br>  if you still can't understand,invoice me!|`|K6CM2623aa	1)<br>  <br>  First substitute the f(x) in the function with the given value:<br>  -4= 5/x + 2<br>  <br>  Next, isolate x by moving numerical terms to the left of the equal sign:<br>  <br>  -4+2= 5/x<br>  (multiply both sides by x to get rid of the x in the denominator)<br>  <br>  x(-4+2) = 5<br>  <br>  Thirdly, simplify:<br>  <br>  x(-2)=5<br>  -2x=5<br>  <br>  Lastly, solve for x by moving last numerical tern to the right to combine like terms.  This can be acheived by dividing both sides by -2:<br>  <br>  x=5/-2<br>  <br>  Leaving your answer as x=   - 5/2.<br>  <br>  The other problems are similiar in that for each one you need to first substitue the x in the f(x), combine like terms, simplify, isolate x and solve.<br>  <br>  *Example:   If I wanted to solve for # 2 on your list I would begin by writing the equation as follows   1/2 = 5/x +2<br>  <br>  As an algebra teacher I know how confusing algebra can appear, but if you just take each problem one piece at a time it may seem less intimidating.  Good luck.|`|oZPmBHqNaa	You just need to plug the value in for x<br>  <br>  1. 5/-4+2=?<br>  <br>  don't forget anything divided by 0 is undefined. You can never divide by 0.

QIZFLZ9Naa	VICTOR HUGO<br>  (1802-1885)<br>  <br>  Victor Hugo nació el 26 de febrero de 1802 en la localidad de Besan?on (Francia), hijo de Sophie-Francoise Trebuchet y de Leopold-Sigisvert Hugo, militar del ejército francés.<br>  El matrimonio de sus progenitores se tambaleó debido a las infidelidades de los dos cónyuges, Sophie con el general Victor Lahorie, y Leopold con la enfermera Catherine Thomas.<br>  <br>  Victor residió, a causa de los servicios militares de su padre, en diversas localidades como Elba, Marsella y Nápoles.<br>  Llegó a Madrid cuando su padre acompa?ó a la península Ibérica al nuevo rey José I (el célebre Pepe Botella), hermano de Napoleón Bonaparte.<br>  <br>  Tras residir en Espa?a durante dos a?os, Hugo se educó en París a partir de 1815, instruyéndose con el objetivo primordial de dedicarse a la literatura.<br>  <br>  Excelente estudiante, a los quince a?os fue premiado por la Academia Francesa por un trabajo lírico, preludio de su primer gran libro de poemas, "Odas y poesías diversas" (1822), un volumen inspirado por Chateaubriand.<br>  <br>  Junto a su hermano Abel fundo la revista "Le Conservateur Litteraire", en donde publicó la novela "Bug Jargal" (1824).<br>  <br>  En 1822 contrajo matrimonio con Adele Foucher, hija de un funcionario del ministerio de defensa francés con quien tendría cinco hijos.<br>  <br>  La censura prohibió su triunfal obra "Marion Delarme" (1829). Al a?o siguiente lograría un un rotundo éxito con el drama "Hernani" (1830).<br>  <br>  Su alta capacidad productiva proporcionó grandes obras a la literatura universal, con títulos como "Cromwell" (1827), "Nuestra se?ora de París" (conocida también como "El jorobado de Notre Dame") (1831) o "El rey se divierte" (1832).<br>  <br>  La muerte de su hermano en 1837, el ahogamiento en el Sena de su hija Leopoldine, y las infidelidades de su esposa con el crítico literario Charles-Augustin Sainte-Beauve, agriaron el carácter del escritor francés.<br>  <br>  Para calmar sus desazones amorosas comenzaría a mantener relaciones sentimentales con la actriz Juliette Drouet, con quien permaneció hasta su muerte.<br>  <br>  Su inclinación a la participación política le hizo ser elegido par de Francia en 1845, nombrado por el rey Luis Felipe de Orleans.<br>  <br>  Con posterioridad, simpatizó con el estallido revolucionario de 1848, hecho que determinó su marcha a Bélgica cuando se restituyó el poder autoritario de Luis Napoleón bajo el nombre de Napoleón III.<br>  <br>  Ante la subida al poder de éste, Hugo se exilió voluntariamente, primero en Jersey y después en la Isla de Guernsey (Gran Breta?a), en donde terminó "Los Miserables" (1862).<br>  <br>  Por esta época acometió incansablemente contra la figura del nuevo emperador en libros llenos de sátira. como "Napoleón el peque?o" (1852) y "Los castigos" (1853).<br>  <br>  <br>  Hugo regresaría a París en el a?o 1870 tras la restauración de la República (en 1859 había desechado una oferta de amnistía de Napoleón III), ocupando diferentes puestos políticos, entre ellos el de senador.<br>  <br>  Falleció el 22 de mayo de 1885, a la edad de 83 a?os, cuando todavía se encontraba pleno en sus facultades sexuales, satisfechas con Juliette Droutte y su criada Blanche Lavin.<br>  <br>  Victor Hugo, un escritor de vastísima producción, cultivó la poesía ("Odas y poesías diversas", "Odas y baladas", "Las Orientales", "Hojas de Oto?o", "Los castigos" o "Las contemplaciones"), la novela ("Han de Islandia", "Nuestra se?ora de París", "Los Miserables" o "El hombre que ríe"), y las obras teatrales ("Cromwell", "Marion Delorme", "Hernani", "El rey se divierte", "Ruy Blas" o "Los Burgraves").<br>  <br>  De fuerte personalidad, acérrimo partidario de la república, practicante de experiencias espiritistas, y amante de las libertades, Victor Hugo implantó las bases ideológicas de la corriente romántica en el prefacio del drama histórico "Cromwell", desligándose así de la literatura clásica.|`|7pKrDivfaa	sauda??es libertárias..........<a href="http://www.orkut.com/FavoriteVideoView.aspx?uid=5524228638342133945&ad=1191998526" rel="nofollow">http://www.orkut.com/FavoriteVideoView.a...</a>

However, some can interfere with fertility and cause pain and heaviness in the scrotum.  Most varioceles are not visible from the outside, although more can be felt than seen.  If it is seen, it looks a lot like a vericose veing right above the scrotum.

He has Yale, Princeton, Colombia, Brown, and UPenn all obsessing over him. This kid, to be honest, is not even that good at football.

uEVJuoKyaa	If you have determined that the snake needs to be transported out of the area, you will need to safely contain the animal. Use your knowledge of the snake and the area to make this determination. Remember, if the snake needs to be moved more than 500 feet from the capture site, a wildlife expert should be responsible for relocating the animal or finding it a responsible home. Randomly relocating wildlife is not a good idea, and in some cases it is against the law. <br>  <br>  For a snake you have positively identified as harmless, temporary containment can be as simple as a knotted sack or a pillowcase secured with a cable tie. Large, strong constrictors such as king snakes and rat snakes can make their way out of an improperly tied bag or even tear the seams of a poorly sewn sack. Do not leave snake sacks unattended, especially in your car. All animals including snakes (and humans) can see through a standard cloth pillowcase that is right over their eyes. Vipers (rattlesnakes and cottonmouths) can deliver a bite through a cloth bag with their long fangs. Use only solid, sturdy containers for venomous snakes.<br>  <br>  Florida law requires that venomous snakes be transported in a sturdy padlocked container such as a ventilated tool box or tackle box that is clearly marked "Poisonous Reptiles". Never leave a live animal in a locked container in direct sunlight. Transport the animal to a suitable facility as soon as possible, or phone Snake Getters for pickup.<br>  <br>  Use "Snake-Jitsu": Safely containing snakes is easy if you know the secrets of "Snake-Jitsu" and how snakes like to behave. An empty wastebasket, cardboard box or garbage tipped onto its side near the snake makes an attractive enough hiding place that a snake usually does not mind being prodded or swept inside. A piece of crumpled newspaper or cloth in the bucket can sometimes be effective in encouraging the snake to go inside and stay inside, because it has something to hide under. A more stubborn animal can be lifted with hook or tongs and placed inside a secure container. Or you can use a snake bagstick and a hook to encourage the snake to move into the bag where it can be secured. <br>  <br>  View a tutorial from the University of Florida that will teach you to safely sweep a snake into a container without ever touching it. You can also place a bowl, a bucket, a wastebasket or a garbage can over a snake that is resting on a flat surface. Make sure the mouth of the container is larger than the snake. If the snake is smaller than the length of the container and you can keep at a safe distance while doing this, you may use your hands. A safe distance is one snake-length away from the snake. <br>  <br>  To extend your reach, use duct tape to fasten the handle of a broom or mop to the bottom of a bucket. To keep the snake from escaping, place heavy weights on top of the bucket and do not leave it unattended. Call a snake expert immediately for pickup and identification. If the bucket is in direct sunlight, wet a towel and place it over the bucket, and provide shade if possible. Do not attempt to move the container once the snake has been secured underneath it. Do not attempt this technique if the snake is on uneven or rocky ground. <br>  <br>  Important Safety Rule: The most important rule for handling snakes safely is that if you don't cause the snake pain, the snake probably won't cause you pain. The techniques that are the safest and most successful are painless and gentle ones that do not force the snake to desperately struggle and fight for its life. Use long tools that extend your reach and give a snake one snake-length of space from all parts of your body. Good "Snake-Jitsu" means gaining control of the situation quickly, calmly, safely and without unnecessary violence. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps, and please be safe.|`|44b4fdd7ed7cc42e599ec8a9302e9632aa	ihaveawhitesnakeinmyhouseanditis<br>  abouttwoyardslongandidonotknow<br>  whatkindofsnakeitisihopeitisnot<br>  poisonousbecauseitjustbitmeand<br>  idonothaveawaytogettoahospital<br>  andisurelydonotwanttodiehere<br>  aloneatsuchayoungage<br>  <br>  everythingisgettingdarkithinki<br>  mightbedyingbuticertainlyhope<br>  notbecauseistillhavethingsiwant<br>  todobeforeidiepleaseifyouread<br>  thissentmehelpandsomeanti<br>  venom|`|0370fd46af40ff0a67a8182e1d0051a2aa	I would ask it to leave right away!|`|Ivldm3NHaa	Did he eat your "space" key?|`|gXsFSMW3aa	Whatever you do, don't ask it if it wants to polka.<br>  <br>  They HATE that.|`|p5wvMr7Zaa	OMGYOUDON'TKNOWHOWTOUSESPACES BETWEENYOU'RWORDS<br>  ITHINKTHATYOUSHOULDLEAVEYOUR HOUSE IMMEDIATELY<br>  ANDCALLANIMALCONTROLFROMA PAYPHONE<br>  ORNIEGHBORSHOUSE<br>  ORCALLTHEPOLICE<br>  ANDFORFURUREREFRENCEYOUSHOULD USESPACESBETWEENYOU'RWORDS|`|YEt188WOaa	Most likely a black rat snake.....harmless.

As the previous answerer wrote, perhaps it's more geographical than anything else. <br>  <br>  TEFL is more common abroad (in non-native English-speaking countries) and ESL is a catch-all term for teaching English as a second/foreign language--whether to international students in an English speaking country or to domestic students in a non-English speaking country.|`|anBqOkspaa	TESL refers to Teachering of English as a second language.

P1LPxdc6aa	There are probably some minor differences from State to State.  If you are going to a public school and you are moving to a new town and, thus, a new school, you'll need your birth certificate and proof of residence.<br>  <br>  There are a few possibilities of changing from one public school to another when you don't move.  They usually have to include documented incidents of you being mistreated and you need to start over in a new school, or the school you are attending is rated so poorly by your State, they may let you change because that school is failing to give you a good education.<br>  <br>  If you are going to a private school, you'll need to meet their private criteria (religion, grade point average, etc.) and you'll need to be able to afford their tuition.|`|2ewj2Mmgaa	Typically you will have to apply to another school and be accepted first.  Then, to transfer and keep credits, etc. the second school will want transcripts, copies of standardized test scores and so on.  The school that you are trying to transfer to will have a list of the requirements, and every school is slightly different, so you should consult someone at that school.  The only thing left, then, is the tuition$$.  Good luck!|`|7cMNxztVaa	Ask your school immediately about an open enrollment process. In my school district, we must report to the district office on a given date (usually the spring before the next school year) and list in a "lottery" system. We are then notified if we made it or not. If you make it, your current school should automatically forward your school records; confirm, just in case.<br>  <br>  Another way to switch schools, is to move. You can move into a home that falls into the range of the school you wish to switch to.|`|pXydnj8Baa	first u have to go the school for registration form and they explain the rest|`|w5IOcb0Iaa	I presume that you are thinking about changing public high schools.  Whether you can change will depend a lot on your state.  In some states like Minnesota it is common and another high school will encourage you to do it because they get the money that comes with you.<br>  <br>  In other states like California, they can make it very difficult.  <br>  <br>  My best advice is to call the high school you want to go to and ask them. <br>  <br>  I would not ask your current high school unless there is a special trusted counselor or someone that you can speak with.  They will probably discourage you.<br>  <br>  Also you might want to look into charter schools in your area.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.
GnccsQTwaa	In my mind the MLS is the stronger option. There is a great deal of technology  in the MLS programs. You can pick your setting, k-12, medical/legal/ university. <br>  <br>  see links<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lisjobs.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lisjobs.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos068.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos068.htm</a>     <br>  <a href="http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos060.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos060.htm</a><br>  <br>  Note comment about about growth and jobs in coming years, retirement ect of librarians. The BLS does indicate a high growth rate for social workers. It really depends on where you want to spend your time. In both cases you are helping people, neither choice is bad.  Look at the earning potential as well in the bls reports for both.<br>  <br>  Talk to  representatives from both programs. They can tell you what the newly minted masters grads are doing ...<br>  <br>  good luck|`|GPBJOH2Vaa	That would depend on what you want to do.  I can speak best to librarianship (since I am a librarian) With an MLS, you can work as a librarian in any one of a number of fields.  There are school librarians, public librarians, academic librarians, and librarians who work in special libraries such as law or medicine.  Some sub-fields of librarianship will pay better than others, of course.  Depending on what kind of coursework you take, you could end up doing preservation/conservation work, cataloging or public services such as reference.  You could even, with some technical expertise, become a systems librarian.  So I guess the first thing to think about is what kind of librarian you are thinking of becoming.<br>  <br>  The repeatedly slashed budgets in recent years have turned some large urban libraries into day destinations for the homeless and/or mentally ill (see Alternet link below).  This has given librarianship a bad rap (as has the widespread public opinion that librarians are merely glorified file clerks).  While this is a problem, the majority of libraries are not like that at all.  For example, I won't call my workplace posh, but it is certainly comfortable in a government-issued-furniture sort of way.<br>  <br>  You'll hear a lot of hype about "the greying of the profession" and how librarians will be in high demand as a consequence.  Many newer librarians discount the hype, believing that older librarians are not retiring as predicted (many working longer, or going into a part-time work kind of semi-retirement), and that shortsighted libraries are replacing fully qualified librarians with paraprofessionals.  And I won't lie to you -- the market for librarians is tough for people looking to go into public librarianship.  However, the market is much, much sunnier for budding academic librarians, and in special libraries (such as law librarianship).  The only catch to those positions is that it is becoming common for academic positions to require (or prefer) a second Masters degree (and a JD is becoming a standard qualification for law librarians).  <br>  <br>  But I'll also tell you that I absolutely love being a librarian.  I help people learn how to find information (which I feel empowers them), and I organize information so that it is findable.  The new directions that librarianship is taking are really exciting, and I work within a profession of exciting, driven, interesting people.|`|xvhTMwBNaa	MLS - you can work in a library for a city or university. You can make really good money as well.|`|d6255767167c76dd77d58e62942f18b3aa	If the state of libraries is any indication of the job market an MLS  is practically worthless.  Libaries are the most undervalued resource in most universities and in most communities.  They are the first agency to experience cuts and they never get the funding back.  DA

GPBJOH2Vaa	Four college classes per semester is considered a full load (12 units), though it is fairly common for people to "overload" and take five classes per semester.  A "full time" course load is supposed to be equivalent to a full time job -- totaling 40 hours a week when you count lecture, lab and studying.  <br>  <br>  Now, if an AP course leads to an AP test, which can be substituted for one college course, it seems as though each high school AP course should be counted as equivalent to a college course.  What you are proposing is taking 6 college courses, or the equivalent of 18 units (when 12 units is considered to be full time) -- or one and a half semesters worth of college coursework in one semester.<br>  <br>  Now, don't get me wrong, people have done this kind of thing before (heck -- I did it back in my undergraduate years), so it is definitely doable.  However, you need to look at how well those courses play to your strengths.  Because one class that turns out to be harder than you thought can disrupt everything quicker than you can believe.  If those classes are all areas in which you feel comfortable, and you have done well in those areas before, then (and only then) would I advise you that your plan may be workable -- and even then, you may be cutting things too tightly.<br>  <br>  You need to look at all of the other things that will demand your time, too.  College applications, extracurricular activities, work, family -- all of these things will demand time that you may not be able to give them if you take the equivalent of a six-course overload.  You need to look not just at your time budget, but the opportunity costs involved as well.<br>  <br>  My advice is for you to not take so many courses -- especially  with college applications coming up.  Drop at least one, or possibly two of the classes you are looking at, and spend that time writing really impressive college applications.  It'll be a better use of your time.|`|rYs4HRENaa	if you did just allright, take one less class and do better this time|`|1XuENPe2aa	Yeah, that's nothing.  2 AP classes senior year?

Pero, por otro, el derecho es definido como aquella ciencia o disciplina que precisamente estudia el derecho. Precisemos más esto.<br>  <br>  Se acepta, por lo general, que el derecho ha existido siempre. De ahí el viejo aforismo ubi homo, ibi jus. Esto es, que donde existe el hombre hay sociedad, y en donde existe sociedad hay derecho, para decirlo de una manera más extendida. En tal sentido, el derecho es, en sustancia, un conjunto de reglas que ordenan la vida en común. Y éstas se han dado siempre, en todas las sociedades, como lo demuestran los hallazgos arqueológicos (así el código de Hammurabi del siglo XVIII a. C. y las leyes medo-asirias, del siglo XII a. C.). Esto no significa que tuviesen un grado muy elaborado de lo que era la parte normativa, pero es indudable que la tuvieron, primitiva o rudimentaria, o si se quiere insuficiente, pero la tuvieron. Correspondió a Roma la creación del derecho en forma, esto es, como cuerpo técnico, y eso es precisamente lo que ha dado origen a los numerosos pueblos que acogieron su legado y que conforman lo que los comparatistas denominan derecho romanista (o romano-civilista, o romano-canónico, o romano-germano, o romano-canónico-germano, pero brevitatis causa, lo podemos llamar familia romanista, para distinguirla de la familia sajona o del common law, que es la otra gran formación histórico-jurídica de Occidente).<br>  <br>  Pues bien, desde siempre existió el derecho (término por cierto más moderno), con lo cual queremos significar que existieron reglas de juego en todas las sociedades, reglas que tenían fundamentos diversos, alcances distintos, con características variadas y sanciones peculiares, pero que tenían un núcleo imperativo que, en esencia, se mantiene hasta ahora (es decir, hay numerosas normas que son simplemente permisivas o indicativas, como lo ha puesto de relieve Hart, pero el núcleo jurídico siempre es imperativo).<br>  <br>  Y si esto es así, advertimos de inmediato lo que muchos han calificado como la historicidad del derecho, lo que implica tres aseveraciones: por un lado, que el derecho siempre ha existido; por otro, que el derecho se configura de acuerdo a cada coyuntura histórica y se transforma con él; y finalmente, que el derecho, a la larga, perece, no siempre permanece, lo cual es más notorio en las civilizaciones desaparecidas.<br>  <br>  En consecuencia, si el derecho es histórico, esto significa que existe un antecedente, un hecho en el pasado que es jurídico y que hay que detectar.<br>  <br>  A los operadores del derecho, fundamentalmente al abogado, al juez, al profesor, al jurista, les interesa el derecho vigente, el que es válido aquí y ahora. Lo anterior, porque el derecho es parte del entramado social y con él tenemos que contar, si queremos saber qué hay de nuestras vidas y cómo nos proyectamos en el futuro. Así, por ejemplo, a cualquier ciudadano que tenga ciertas pretensiones o problemas de herencia, le interesará saber qué dice sobre esta materia el Código Civil de 1984, actualmente vigente, y no lo que decía el Código Civil de 1936, vigente durante muchos a?os, pero no ahora, pues fue derogado hace a?os.<br>  <br>  Esto es lo que interesa al hombre de derecho y al hombre común y corriente que se relaciona con el derecho.<br>  <br>  Pero el historiador busca el derecho del pasado, que es, por lo general, el derecho no vigente. El derecho que no existe hoy con fuerza, es el no derecho, es el derecho derogado y, en cuanto tal, no interesa. Por cierto, sabemos perfectamente que en ciertos ámbitos, de manera muy marcada, interesa el derecho derogado, o sea, el derecho no vigente. Así, en materia penal, no se puede juzgar por la norma vigente hoy en día, sino por la norma que estaba vigente cuando se cometió el delito, en el supuesto que sea más favorable, y no con la actual, si es más severa. A veces el derecho derogado tiene vigencia, pero por cierto tiempo; es lo que se conoce como ultraactividad. Esto también sucede en otros ámbitos, como en el derecho civil (así, cuando analizamos situaciones que están regidas por los cambios de un código a otro código, y situaciones que se dan con la existencia del llamado derecho transitorio o en materia tributaria, en donde es tan debatido el problema de los tributos derogados, pero que son más tarde detectados por la administración tributaria y que pueden ser objeto de acotación, siempre y cuando no haya operado la prescripción. Pero éstas son las excepciones).<br>  <br>  Lo frecuente es que el derecho derogado deje de interesar y sea reemplazado, para todos sus efectos, por el derecho vigente.<br>  <br>  Por cierto, el derecho vigente también puede tener su pasado; así, si el Código Civil de 1984 se aplicó a una situación determinada de 1990, se trata de una realidad pasada, que interesa como referencia o antecedente, y que sólo puede ser invocada en la medida en que en esa época el Código era el mismo. Pero las situaciones pueden haber cambiado y, por eso, tal aplicación judicial del Código Civil en 1990 puede ser objeto de un análisis histórico, pues se trata de historia reciente.<br>  <br>  Ahora bien, ?cómo enfocamos el pasado en materia jurídica? ?Es posible decir que el pasado es tan sólo una sucesión de códigos y leyes, y que el análisis del pasado se limita a este examen exegético de la norma? Creo que la respuesta es negativa. El pasado del derecho se expresa, querrámoslo o no, en hechos, o sea, en personas y en determinadas situaciones a las cuales se les aplica o para las que se invoca un derecho vigente en aquel entonces. Pero el derecho no vigente, o sea, el derecho en cuanto pasado, no es sólo la norma, sino el conjunto de hechos que se mueve alrededor de la norma y con la cual forma una unidad. Si bien la ciencia jurídica o ciencia del derecho estudia las normas y en consecuencia se centra en ellas, el derecho como experiencia -dentro del cual se da el complejo normativo-, es mucho más amplio, incluye un flujo social en donde precisamente la norma se desenvuelve, desarrolla y aplica. Así, considerando el derecho en cuanto pasado, su historia no es la historia de la norma y su aplicación, sino la historia del flujo normativo que condensa derecho y entorno social en el cual ha vivido. Se trata, en consecuencia, de una experiencia que precisamente permite un conocimiento global y que, en cuanto histórica, es masa social que atraviesa una porción de tiempo en unidad de processus.<br>  <br>  Por tanto, cuando queremos analizar el derecho no vigente, en tanto existió, el primer paso es indudablemente conocer y estudiar la norma que estuvo vigente en aquel momento, pero no aislada, sino dentro del tejido social en el cual nació, se desenvolvió y aplicó. Existe en el pasado un torrente jurídico que es continuidad, que surge de un tiempo a otro y sigue un proceso hacia adelante.<br>  <br>  Pero este pasado jurídico, en cuanto pasado, en cuanto no existente, no es derecho sino derecho en versión histórica.|`|NYrne1ISaa	El derecho estudia las relaciones humanas en el sentido de crear reglas para una mejor convivencia.|`|QbcS5KZhaa	El de saber quien son los ricos y quien tienen el poder y generar leyes par que eso se mantenga así siempre.
b8d7d453050012404f0dfeb62b0d9dd8aa	I'm not going to lie. The work is hard and it is really intense. I'm pretty sure that is far more work and pressurized than at most universities. Typically I have to write two 2000 words long essays a week (have a feeling English students do slightly less than this as they all seem really laid back). To prepare for that you are given long reading lists and so you spend a lot of time reading a few books and journal articles for each essay. In addition there are lectures and tutorials which iare a weekly sessions with your tutor that are normally one on one or two or three on one. The workload can come as a shock and tutorials can seem intimidating as you are discussing your subject with someone who is in most cases far more clever that you and knows more stuff. Eventually though you get use to it and develop a routine. The important thing is to manage your time and make an effort to work effectively. How good you are at this will probably determine how much spare time you have. Personally I've had many nights where I've just worked through until the morning (it's called an essay crisis), but some of my more organised friends have never had to work much past 10pm and fitted in loads of other stuff into their day.You'll probably still be knackered at the end of term though so thank God they are only 8 weeks long.<br>  <br>  It is certainly not all work as there is a ridiculous amount of stuff for student to do. There are so many societies and clubs so you are almost certain to find something that interests you. If not found a club yourself. The main reason why student life at Oxford is different to that at other universities is that it has a collegiate system. Oxford is made up of 39 (i think) semi-autonomous colleges. For example I go to Merton which has 300 or so undergrads and 300 post grad students. Some are bigger than this (eg. Keble, Christ Church) some are smaller (eg. Corpus Christi, Mansfield). Each college has a hall where you can go for meals, a chapel a bar and will offer you accommodation for some if not all your years. This all helps to build a sort of community feel. You tend to identify with your college first and the university second as most of your friends will be at your college, although some people may be exceptions to this. I think the college system makes making friends a bit easier as you are not confronted with some thing as large as a whole university but instead have a smaller more manageable group of people which you tend to feel comfortable socialising with. Many of my friends at other universities ended up only knowing a few people studying their subject, the people living immediately around them and a couple of random folks.<br>  <br>  In each college the undergraduates form a Junior Common Room or JCR (confusingly also the name of a room in college used by the JCR). It's run by a committee of the students and acts as a sort of mini student union (there is also OUSU the Oxford University Student Union). The JCR organises loads of social events such as drinks, dinners and bops which are college parties. At Merton we have fancy dress bops every other Saturday in our Sports Pavilion, other colleges have different number of bops with varying quality. Each college will also have many sports teams and other societies, which is quite good if you are just looking to have some fun or aren't really good enough to make the university team and college societies tend to be less formal and more friendly as generally you are already friends with the people in it. If you feel like getting out of college you can always go to something at the university level or make friends with people from different colleges. While it less lively  than some of the larger cities Oxford has a decent nightlife and at least it is safer. There are a fair few clubs in the City centre and they often have a special student night, eg. Park End on Wednesday, Po Na Na on Thursday, Filth on Friday (I've known people do this on consecutive nights and then go to a bop on Saturday). There are also a good number of decent pubs scattered around the city as well. If you just want a cheap drink with friends you can always go to the college bar.<br>  <br>  If you think you have a chance just give it a shot. Sure it can be stressful and hard work, but you do get used to dealing with it, you receive a quality education and you really can have a lot of fun. I genuinely wouldn't want to be anywhere else.

It becomes insulting when you are looking to personally degrade the person.|`|HHuS48u5aa	Criticism is possibly positive and can be used (if one so desires) to improve oneself whereas insulting is just used to be obnoxious..    Example: to talk especially and deliberately slow (like the listener is a moron) is insulting. There is no possible improvement.  Example:  "If you butt were any larger you would need.."..is just plain insulting.    Criticism, is instructive. Such as:   "alot is not the term you want. If you mean a bunch, then it is two words." That is helpful (but still may not be welcome).    While possibly unwelcome, criticism can be beneficial..especially constructive criticism.    ME? I do not want any feedback whatsoever usually..and only the most constructive of criticism. Use kid gloves..and I still might snap your head off.

I think it is a polite way of saying I simply wont ask you a question and not acknowledge your effort by  leaving  it up to a public vote.    I notice many people who give answers actually don't have a clue and sometime will answer with " Whaaaaaaaaat", "lol", " I can't help you with this one" or they invent a ludicrous answer.    I think they just want to chat or get their two points.       Most of the questions that people ask, can be accessed on Google or any search engine- they don't really need to come here. But  sometime their spelling and grammar are really so atrocious, that Google would not recognise the questions. So I see why they do.  C'est la Vie.

Remember, a volcabulary is for life and should continue to grow, rather than being just for exams or SATs etc.|`|YWfeRt41aa	Memorizing the dictionary isn't a very good idea. Perhaps you could find a book that you know will challenge you, you'll be getting the enjoyment out of reading the book but also learning new words. Reading also helps because you learn how to use those new words in sentences. I advise keeping a dictionary beside you as you read; so if you come across a word you don't understand you can look it up instantly.  I hope this works - good luck.|`|nkEEQtmEaa	Of course, I agree with my fellow Answerers above -- reading is probably the best way to do it!      However, if you are not a big reader, or if you want an alternative method, a FUN way to increase your vocabulary is to do crossword puzzles.  If you try to do each day's puzzle, you will find that after a while, a lot of the answers come second nature to you.  Eventually, you will be watching for paper every day so you can pull the puzzles out and start on them.  You may want to grab the biggest dictionary you can to help you get started. That way, you'll have more motivation to learn the words in their normal context.      I hope this helps and I commend you for wanting to improve your way of communicating!

Duke is arguably less prestigious than Columbia and Penn because it's not an Ivy, but there are plenty of people to whom that distinction doesn't matter.  They're all excellent, very competitive universities.|`|KKM6kW7uaa	Beg to differ with the first answerer. Duke University is among the best in the country also.  As is Emory in Atlanta.  Just because a University is not in the Northeast does not make it any the less prestigious as the Ivy Leagues.  And if you are considering Medicine, Emory would be a wonderful choice also.  I do not regret a penny spent on my daughter's Emory education.  She went to South Africa on with Habitat thru the school and to Ecuador with a sociology study program during her senior year.  There is so much available at the "high-end" schools that is not necessarily apparent during the investigative period.  That's why talking with people AT the school is so important.     Columbia in NYC might be an excellent school, but it might not be fit for you. And lots of students have actually been DISTRACTED by living in New York City.  It's a great place IF it's your style.  Having lived most of my first 30 years in and near NYC, I would not want to be a student there.  Also, New York is a VERY expensive city to live in, even if you are in a dorm, which is probably not likely in the long run.     BUT     First and foremost, apply and see where you are accepted.  Apply to as many as you can afford, but make a list in preference order before applying and AFTER you have done some research on each school.  THEN visit the schools, plan a weekend if it is a far distance. Talk with STUDENTS and also ask if you can sit in on a class in one of your desired areas of study.  THEN speak with (make an appointment first to do all of this) the Financial Aid Office.  See what the various schools are offering in the way of aid.  THEN you have to just see which school feels more comfortable.  It's like finding a great pair of shoes.......you have to shop and research and see which feels best on YOU.  Good luck to you. And remember one thing:  most students change their major at least once during their college stay......it is part of finding yourself, finding where you need to be.  And don't go to college to be a "whatever" because your parents think it would be a good thing for you.  It's a very expensive investment to build the rest of YOUR life on.

c6eb67c569aaeb5b6fd18c4e82851da1aa	Papermaking has been around for about 4,000 years. The Egyptians had a process of making papyrus, a plant based paper product. The Chinese in the 2nd century BC had a paper making process involving a fibrous matter. In the 8th century, Arabs had learned the art of paper making, which explains the rise of their intellectual endeavors and learning. It is one of those basic products that make our civilization what it is. But how is it made? Although the process has been refined over the years, the process today is less due to innovation than to efficiency of existing processes. It uses wood and it consists of eight stages: debarking, chipping, pulping, bleaching, paper machine, blade coater, supercalendar, and sheet converting.    The Composition of Wood    Wood is a renewable resource that consists mainly of cellulous, lignin, and a small portion of terpenes, resins, and fatty acids. The breakdown of wood is 45% cellulose and 30% hemi-cellulose. It also contains 23% lignin, which is a resinous material that binds the cellulose fibers together. It has less than 5% substances like terpenes, resins and fatty oils and acids.    1. Debarking    Because the process starts with cutting trees, the bark from trees must be removed before the wood can be used for papermaking. A large, spinning and rotating drum that makes the logs move around is used to debark the trees. As the logs rub against each other, the bark comes off.    2. Chipping    Before the logs are pulped, they are cut into small pieces or chips. A large rotating knife goes in circles and cuts the logs into chips.    3. Pulping    The pulping process separates the cellulose and hemi-cellulose from the lignin and removes other tree oils and resins. This process is important because the remaining fibers are used to produce the product we know as paper. There are two main pulping processes, chemical pulping and mechanical pulping.    Chemical or Kraft Pulping    Chemical pulping produces very pure cellulose fibers. It is the most common form of chemical pulping in North America. In Kraft pulping the wood chips are cooked in sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfide to produce a strong dark brown pulp. It is a highly efficient process for removing lignin and resins in softwoods while still producing a high-quality pulp. Wood wastes are burned for fuel and more than 95 per cent of the pulping chemicals are recovered for re-use.    However, there are some problems. The release of hydrogen sulfide and the mercaptan family of sulfides can cause the characteristic paper-town smell of rotten eggs, although the use of scrubbers in mills has reduced odor emissions over the past 20 years. A second problem is that cellulose fibers that are lost during the Kraft process can be discharged with wastewater, and can build up fiber beds, causing environmental problems around wastewater pipes. In this case too, technical improvements have largely eliminated the problem. Because of the dark color of the resulting pulp, however, Kraft fibers require considerable bleaching to make them usable.    Mechanical Pulping    The second pulping process is mechanical pulping. It is a process that forces debarked logs against a grinding stone or rotating metal disks to produce pulp. This is both good and bad. The percentage of usable pulp is higher, but the resulting paper quality is lower. As much as 95 per cent of the wood resource is turned into pulp, in contrast to Kraft pulping which is only 45-50 per cent. But the paper quality is lower because mechanical pulping is an energy-intensive process that is not as efficient as Kraft because the lignin and tree resins remain in the pulp. The grinding process breaks the cellulose fibers when tearing them apart, which decreases pulp strength. As a result, the paper has a weak fiber network and the high lignin content, which causes it to darken when it is exposed to sunlight. Paper produced by this process is used mainly for newsprint, telephone books and similar applications where high quality paper is not really needed.    Steam and Chemical Treating    In a variation on the mechanical pulping process the chips are steam treated beforehand. This process also called thermo-mechanical pulping (TMP) reduces the energy consumption process by softening chips with steam prior to grinding. And then going a step further, in chemo-thermo mechanical pulping (CTMP) the wood chips are soaked with sulfur-based chemicals prior to steaming. This allows the lignin and resin to be extracted from the wood, which results in a stronger pulp. Pulp produced by CTMP can be used in the production of coated papers.    4. Bleaching    Bleaching is a very important step. Bleaching is used to purify and clean the pulp. Bleaching removes lignin, which affects the purity of the fiber. Kraft mills use chlorine gas and chlorine dioxide to bleach pulp, while most mechanical pulp bleaching operations use peroxide. Chlorine gas removes most of the remaining lignin, while the chlor|`|fwf30kGDaa	First-Cut Down trees  Second-bring the trees to factories  Third-they flatten the wood  Fourth-Cut it thinner  Fifth- They cure it.(Dry it)  Six-out it goes to people|`|lbr2VTy1aa	Trees are cut down, and the lumber is then taken to a plant where it is processed.

Have you ever seen splinters in wood? Look at some wood and then some brown paper towel that your school has. Can you see little splinters or small pieces of material in the paper?   Trees are cut down in the forest and are then sent to a paper mill      At the paper mill, a machine removes the bark from the wood. In this picture you can see logs being thrown into the machine on the left and the wood and bark coming out on the right.   Bark is not used to make paper, but it is used for other things. Can you think of ways that bark can be used? Nothing is wasted.        Once the bark is removed from the wood, it is chopped into very small pieces with a chipper.   Can you see the wood being thrown into the machine on the left? The small pieces of wood are coming out of the bottom of the big machine.    Did you know that they cook wood so that it can be made into paper? In this picture, the chipped wood and some chemicals are added to a big pressure cooker.  The wood chips are cooked until they turn into a soft, slippery pulp or slurry.     Now the soft, slippery paper pulp or slurry is poured into a container. In this picture the container is on the left side.   The container pours the slurry onto a large screen. This is where the water is drained from the paper.

I have no problem saying to hell with america and its educational system.  I am now in private business and making over $250,000 per year.    Any questions?
ytiw1UXiaa	I changed my high school after 10th grade too.  I sat down with my father and explained to him all of the reasons I wanted to and threw in some stuff parents like to hear.  Explain to them that you only get four years of high school and you want to be able to enjoy them and get a good education.  Tell them that you are looking for new experiences and everyone at your school is sad and you don't want them bringing you down, you understand that the new school would be far away, but it would only be for two years and since it is so important to you can you please work out something so you can have a pleasant high school experience.  I changed schools and it worked out really well for me so good luck!
zZxX5PXBaa	A transitive verb is where the verb takes an object, so you do something to something, or at something. I hit a dog, I regurgitate a goldfish, or whatever.    An intransitive verb is where the verb doesn't take an object, so you just do something. Like ... I dream, or I throw up, or I sleep.    Some events, like throwing up, can be described with a transitive or intransitive verb, though with the transitive version you're usually adding more detail (the goldfish, in this case). And some verbs can be transitive or  intransitive depending on how you use them. I dream. I dream of regurgitating goldfish.

W5kncF6Maa	Linear motion is motion along a straight whiteline, and can therefore be described mathematically using only one spatial dimension. It can be uniform, that is, with constant speed, or non-uniform, that is, with a variable speed. The motion of a particle (a point-like object) along the line can be described by its position x, which varies with t (timers).<br>  <br>  An example of linear motion is that of a ball thrown straight up and falling back straight down on to toddles head.<br>  <br>  <br>  The instantaneous velocity of a particle in linear motion may be found by differentiating the position x with respect to the time variable t. The acceleration may be found by differentiating the velocity. By the fundamental theorem of calculus the converse is also true: to find the velocity when given the acceleration, simply integrate the acceleration with respect to time; to find displacement, simply integrate the velocity with respect to time.<br>  <br>  This can be demonstrated graphically. The gradient of a line on the displacement time graph represents the velocity. The gradient of the velocity time graph gives the acceleration while the area under the velocity time graph gives the displacement. The area under an acceleration time graph gives the velocity.<br>  <br>  Linear motion is the most basic of all motions. According to Newton's first law of motion, objects not subjected to forces will continue to move uniformly in a straight line indefinitely. Under every-day circumstances, external forces such as gravity and friction will cause objects to deviate from linear motion and can cause them to come to a rest.<br>  <br>  For linear motion embedded in a higher-dimensional space, the velocity and acceleration should be described as vectors, made up of two parts: magnitude and direction. The direction part of these vectors is the same and is constant for linear motion, and only for linear motion.<br>  <br>  <br>  
1LJp6jttaa	The sentinels, Horatio and Bernardo, are up on the walls of the castle talking about the ghost they have just seen, and what reason the ghost could possibly have for being there.   Then Horatio recalls that in Rome just before Julius Caesar was murdered, dead people came out of their graves & walked around still wrapped in their burial sheets   ...  so he reasons that when unnatural events like that or like shooting stars occur, then it's a sign, like a prophecy, that some terrible event is about to happen.  The scene is Shakespeare's way of letting the audience know they should prepare themselves for some highly dramatic stuff, because the ghost is a sign that foretells it.

Cheat on every test and quiz, and you will get A's!|`|0iiLfuiIaa	Since you're currently failing that class, the best thing to do is to talk to your teacher for extra help or extra credit. Unless you plan to drop that class and go for an easier math class, there's nothing you can do except explain your situation to your teacher and ask for help. There isn't any way to change your Mid Term RCs but you can change your GPA for the year if you dedicate yourself. Get a tutor (they usually have National Honor Society tutors in the Guidance Office or someplace like that) and REALLY start cracking the book.<br>  <br>  P.S. DO NOT CHEAT! Cheaters are eventually caught and cheating leads to a teacher never trusting you again (they will constantly watch you and scrutinize everything you had in and they will tell all your other teachers), you will get many detentions and maybe suspension, and it will go on your permanent records. If you're worried about doing poorly in school, cheating is the wrong way to go because it will screw things up even more.<br>  <br>  P.P.S. What math are you learning? There are plenty of sites online that can help you understand math and, if worst comes to worst, you can ask people online for help - like me ;D<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|QxExRnTQaa	From what I understand, it seems like you're not getting the work.

BeFneHRgaa	There are many ways in which the theme of violence occurs in 'of mice and men'...    Then explain:  The acts of violence: Curly fighting Lennie, Lennie Killing Curley's Wife and George killing Lennie.    Use and explain a quote from the book to show how this is physically violent.    e.g  'Lennie covered his face with his huge paws and bleated with terror... Then Curley attacked his stomach' Page 91    By using the words 'paws' and 'bleated' Lennie is being likened to an animal, this is comparing the fight with those in nature. Violence is often a natural human reaction when a person is angry, in this case Curley is angry with Lennie for being a lot larger than he is, leaving Curley feeling the need to prove himself.      Go on to explain how each of these acts of violence link together and the differences between them.    End by saying how each of these acts could be considered innocent.    Lennie and Curley's fight = a matter of instinct.  Lennie killing Curley's wife = An accident  George killing Lennie = to prevent Lennie harming any one else, and to prevent anyone harming Lennie.

Sometimes there is trouble, but I just sit here and keep quite and not moving a muscle.  <br>  People come here to share stories, have a few laughs, maybe rest or feed he birds.<br>  I cannot tell you all the gossip I have heard throughout the years!  I have also shared tears with the homeless person who comes here every day to sit on me as he holds his little paper bag.  I have enjoyed little children who play beside me while their parents sit on me and talk on the phone.<br>  When it rains, I don't mind too much, but when it snows, it is not too great because I don't have as many visitors.

I'd suggest taking a different angle, and write a story about the alter life of the park bench who leads a double life at night as a crime solver detective.  Analyzing clues criminals left behind when they sat on it during the day.  The bench would only be able to talk to a paranoid schizo homeless man that sleeps on it at night and that only it trusts.  He must relay the bench's crime solving discoveries to the police, and then save the day.  Only to return to its day duty as the lonely park bench that is misunderstood, but still loves the public. |`|n0I0Fw7Haa	Give the bench life. What it looks like, the things that it sees during the day, the smells, the dropped food it taste, the secret it hears on and on. The cold in the weather- yearning for the warmth of a sitter- the joy of the spring -waiting on the summer. The joy of being needed. Ready to relive the tired feet of a person who has worked all day to providing a bed to someone down on their luck- Hope this helps.

The movement of objects, without contact or with only limited contact was frequently observed in the séance room. Phenomena included rappings, table-turning, levitations, the conveyance of apports, and other material phenomena. Spiritualists believed these were caused by the intervention of discarnate spirits. Magnetists believed in the existence of some kind of fluidic or energetic emanation as the cause of such movements. Others, discounting those phenomena that were the result of fraud, suggested some form of telekinetic theory, which held that all these varied feats are accomplished by the thoughts of mediums and sitters, independent of muscular energy, whether direct or indirect.<br>  <br>  Meaning #1: the power to move something by thinking about it without the application of physical force<br>    Synonym: psychokinesis<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/telekinesis" rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/topic/telekinesis</a><br>  <br>  The term psychokinesis (from the Greek ψυχ?, "psyche", meaning mind, soul, or breath; and κ?νησι?, "kinesis", meaning motion; literally "movement from the mind")[1][2] , also known as telekinesis[3] (Greek τ?λε + κ?νησι?, literally "distant-movement"), sometimes abbreviated PK and TK respectively, denotes the paranormal ability of the mind to influence matter, time, space, or energy without the use of any currently known type of physical means.[4] Examples of psychokinesis could include distorting or moving an object[5], or influencing the output of a random number generator.[6] [7]<br>  <br>  The study of phenomena said to be psychokinetic is an aspect of the field of parapsychology. Parapsychology has used various methods to research psychokinesis, most frequently random number generators.[8] Parapsychologists generally agree that psychokinesis exists and deserves further study, pointing to experimental results such as those done using random number generators.[9][10] Skeptics contend that psychokinesis does not exist but only appears to due to fraud, delusion, statistical manipulation of scientific data, wishful thinking, or other naturally explainable phenomena.[11] Psychokinesis is a popular ability in entertainment movies, written fiction, and computer games.<br>  <br>  (more.....)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/psychokinesis" rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/topic/psychokines...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.search.com/search?q=telekinesis" rel="nofollow">http://www.search.com/search?q=telekines...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.search.com/search?q=psychokinesis" rel="nofollow">http://www.search.com/search?q=psychokin...</a>|`|XimiDwgdaa	lol    good luck, and besides, why are you posting this in "words and wordplay" ?<br>  |`|EX4jrCM2aa	joke

She's allowed to keep you home if she homeschools you, but since she's not doing that, you're entitled to a public education.|`|mquRob1faa	just fail the tests next time. if u know the right answer, mark the one thats not it. thats only if nothing else works though. <br>  i'd go to DSS and tell them whats going on. they wont take u away, dont worry. theyll just enroll u in public school and make sure ur going. |`|021MIkuxaa	If your mother hasnt taught you at all since 5th grade how come the test questions were easy for you? Surely she must have taught you something. I would definately just try respectfully reasoning with her again, but be prepared that she is your mother and does have the right to make decisions based on what she feels is best for you. One day you will look at your own child and understand that and then you will want to tell your mum that but wont be able to because shes either 1. In jail (because you sicked a lawyer onto her and for some bizzarre reason the court will listen to the story of child over an adult) or 2 You are not on speaking terms because you took her to court all those years ago.<br>  I personally cant believe you are even considering taking your own mother to court! |`|bWTNXVS0aa	Do you have another family member who could intervene for you?  Perhaps she so firmly believes she is doing the right thing for you that she thinks school won't be good for you.  You need to come at it from another angle.  Don't attack her ways so much (the most eccentric people can be really stubborn sometimes) instead come at it from "I am curious about this school thing approach. I want to know what all these kids do all day. If I don't like it, I can always come home"|`|ZKeVEmCFaa	What grade are you in now.  She has the responsibility to keep teaching you and if she isn't contact the local home school office and basically rat her out.|`|1NBBZO2xaa	Denying you an education is child abuse.

AA12095483	He's telling you that he likes you but he doesn't want to go beyond friendship right now. Respect that, enjoy him as a friend, and when the time is right and the vibes are there, he'll discover that maybe he does want you for a girlfriend after all. |`|7fDfAbQ1aa	Probably because his last girlfriend did something or something happened to his last girl friend..or something in between them..but doesn't want it to happen again..if you want to understand...read the book the boy next door by R.L stine.
8c3928ce39cd98e96b5b55afe6bfec47aa	What age group and what is the subject your teaching?<br>  <br>  Roll of toilet paper - ask each student to take as few or as much as they would like, when everyone has a piece or two, then ask them to tell the class something about themselves for each square piece of paper, such as;<br>  my name is?<br>  I like ? (type) music<br>  I play sport (type)<br>  etc<br>  <br>  Make sure you take some too, so they learn a little about you. This can be fun as someone will always take more than half a dozen pieces. <br>  <br>  Bean bag (small) - tossed (gently) from student to student, and they have to tell something about themselves as above.<br>  <br>  Snowball activity - have each student write on a piece of paper three things about themselves, including their name. Then they crumple the paper up into a 'snowball' and have a one-minute snowball fight. At the end of the minute, everyone grabs the closest snowball and has to try to find the person who wrote it. They then introduce that person to the rest of the group, sharing the three facts. <br>  <br>  Brain storm - subject written up on the board and ask students to toss ideas of what they think the subject means, write each answer on the board regardless of it being correct or not. Once everyone has given an answer, give a quick over view of what the subject is/means e.g humanitarian is about seeking or promoting health & well being (welfare) of people. <br>  <br>  Communication - write on 10 pieces of paper a number from one to 10 place into a container, each student is then to take one piece of paper, then find get into the numerical order from 1-10 with out talking. The object of this is to find another way to communicate with out talking. <br>  <br>  I did the communication ice breaker, when I did my Workplace Training as part of an assessment, it was hilarious to watch how the students found their place, only one student got the idea, after watching me jump up and down 3 times, I did toe taps, hand gestures etc, it turned out he too worked with people with disabilities who were unable to communicate. The others just stood there looking at me and the other guy, as if we had gone mad lol. In the end I had to give them a starting point of number one. The out come was I taught everyone the importance of communication and the types of communication people use. <br>  <br>  Hope these few ice breakers helps|`|3b3b2367606e4e7e3617acac7e67ae45aa	We need more information to answer your question. Assuming you are asking as a teacher, tell us the grade level you are teaching, and the subject. Tell us something about the age and level of interest of the students. Are they self-motivated, or completely passive in class? What kind of "activity" did you have in mind? If you can be a little more specific, maybe we can give you some ideas. |`|de3217ae7454e66a964a10cbffde3ae4aa	Here are some suggestions:<br>  <br>  You can ask a student to write the answer on the board. Or you can ask a student to ask another student to answer. Or you can tell students you are going to read out the answers, with a few errors thrown in, and you want them to correct you. Or you can put students in teams, ask each team to create their own list of questions to answer about the material, then get the two teams to challenge each other.<br>  <br>  I wrote an article that relates to this topic. It's written for language teachers, but I think teachers in other fields would also find it very interesting (see the link below). Enjoy!|`|4Gd5eAtpaa	Maybe you could offer a reward at the end of the day for the student who participates the most? or have a bag of little prizes - like pencils, rulers, stamps, stickers, and hand them to the students who answer. I guess it depends what age they are. If they are a bit older, maybe you could try a 'getting to know each other' session. If the students are more comfortable with their peers, they might be more willing to join in. Hope this helps.|`|wofgV6Gyaa	you can write student names on popsicle sticks and pick a person when nobody raises their hands. and you can give out smarties for hard questions. if its for 6th graders and up, ou should tell them their citizenship counts too when they had a conversasion with the class or teacher. |`|824c44a040458a609cb154ccfffb9d7caa	ask them if that's the best they can do?<br>  <br>  challenge them.|`|CVXJL9oVaa	Games like jeopardy worked for one of my teachers, then their was one where a teacher had a football if you where thrown the foot ball you had to answer, students passed the ball.  |`|sibFhZyWaa	Make a game out of it. Each correct answer will be worth one point. The first one to reach 10 points gets an extra 10 minutes on their break.

J78L72Wyaa	It is worth|`|msVapdG2aa	It is good to gain some experience and then go for MBA. Pre-MBA experience helps you to understand the course better and get good lateral placement. Engineering with MBA is a good combination for further prospect. It would be advisable that you prepare for a good B-school and then exercise your option.|`|s7DAUxjYaa	No. take a break, find some experiences.|`|pvWua3CMaa	You should first be clear, what type of career you want. If you want to be in a managerial job position, MBA is a must, specially after 2-3 years of experience from your branch of engineering. These 2-3 years experience help you understand the managerial tasks quite easily, since engineering students like us, do not have any background knowledge as such for it (unless you know people in this field).<br>  <br>  If you want to stay in your field, then MBA is not a good option. M.tech or M.S. from UK or Canada or US would be good enough.<br>  <br>  There are many many specializations of the engineering branches.<br>  See the IIT prospectives for it...<br>  Good luck!|`|HjjLoPB1aa	ya surely it does....i believe that this is time when the whole world is facing financial difficulties...so better to do some cource as packages are going to hit first...and if you have some plans regarding MBA no better time can you find then this|`|5a32b4eb0b5c266e636a5143f63e1d99aa	doing MBA immediately after BE is the best option for any engineer...
