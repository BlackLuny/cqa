Lo que ocurre es que en tu caso particular dices que solo lo utilizas  cuando necesitas que te orienten en algo y no participas constantemente...esa es la diferencia.

AA10023480	A weblog. Specifically an online diary.|`|AA11514184	A blog is a user-generated website where entries are made in journal style and displayed in a reverse chronological order.<br>  <br>  Blogs often provide commentary or news on a particular subject, such as food, politics, or local news; some function as more personal online diaries. A typical blog combines text, images, and links to other blogs, web pages, and other media related to its topic. The ability for readers to leave comments in an interactive format is an important part of many blogs. Most blogs are primarily textual although some focus on photographs (photoblog), sketchblog, videos (vlog), or audio (podcasting), and are part of a wider network of social media.<br>  <br>  The term "blog" is derived from "Web log." "Blog" can also be used as a verb, meaning to maintain or add content to a blog.<br>  <br>  As of November 2006, blog search engine Technorati was tracking nearly 60 million blogs|`|349d732155b519353cbb20d49f853d97aa	I posted the link below

AA10766356	I found the following answer to the question by logging into my yahoo account:<br>  "You cannot change your Yahoo! ID except by opening a new account, but you can add up to five aliases to your current ID as part of the same account. An alias consists of a name and some information that you show in a profile to other members. When you log in to Yahoo!, you can choose any of your aliases.<br>  To create a new alias, go to the Yahoo! Member Directory. Make sure you are signed in, then click on "My Profiles." The next page lists your ID and any profiles that you have already created. To make a new profile, click the "Create New Public Profile" button near the top.<br>  The only required field is the actual name—all other information is optional. You should not reveal any information on your profile that you wouldn't want a complete stranger to know (such as your phone number or address).<br>  When you're done, use the "Create Profile" button. This takes you back to your profile list, with your new name added. Make sure to click the "Finished Editing" link to save your changes.<br>  If you decide to re-register and create a new ID, you will need to reset all of your preferences for My Yahoo! and other personalized Yahoo! services.<br>  Information between separate accounts cannot be merged or exchanged."|`|XZNSMtjraa	You can't.

But most answers that are deleted come from complaints from people like us. There are some people that just ask rude cruel and really sad questions. Incest hurting other people and just all around weird stuff and they are the ones who get reported to yahoo.

xwSNEYICaa	I don't know where to buy them wholesale.  You can try www.liquidation.com though.  They sell surplus and returned items from major places like Best Buy, Amazon, Walmart, ect..  They offer many different size loads.  I used to buy items from there all the time for resale.  You would be amazed at how many people return items that there is nothing wrong with.  If you look around at the auction pictures, you will be able to figure out which store has which id (for example: onlineretail is Amazon).  They take Paypal, which is ideal for Ebay Resellers.  Shipping is a min. of $40, and it depends on the weight and how far away you are.  If you are looking to not spend a lot to begin with, stick with packages vs. pallets.  They have search options to narrow it down.  Also pick a warehouse on the same side of the country as you.  <br>  <br>  Another place that deals in major store (Target, Kmart, Walmart, Kohls, Sears, ect..) returns and overstocks is www.gencomarketplace.com  They are a reverse-logistics company.  What this means is they take overstock, close-out, & returned merchandise and sell it to the public.  Ever wonder what happens to the items at Target after they clearance them out?  This is where they go (although some donate them to GoodWill).  <br>  <br>  You do need a business license for Genco, where you do not need one for liquidation.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

7u77AiBjaa	UPDATE: I get that, but if you want to see if your 360 image will show up, you need to put your Y/A settings on that option (not the Yahoo! Avatar).<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  Patience is necessary when using the 360 image feature. Also, your profile picture isn't showing because you've chosen to use the Yahoo! Avatar. Switch your Yahoo! Answers settings to the 360 image option and wait.<br>  <br>  OFTEN it takes minutes, hours, days, or weeks for the system to catch up to changes made through Yahoo! 360. So, in the meantime, you will be without any picture on Y/A (a gray unisex icon), words/red "x" in box will show, or an old 360 image will appear. Just choose the 360 image option in your Yahoo! Answers profile and let your picture stay that way until the Y/A system makes the adjustment.<br>  <br>  After a few days of waiting, you can certainly contact Y/A staff by posting a BUG report on the Y/A forum at <a href="http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answers">http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answe...</a> . I recommend putting BUG: to start the title of your message. Also, you can do a search on the forum and add a comment to messages other people have posted about the problem. This problem can only be resolved system-wide (temporarily or permanently) by Yahoo staff.

VQdqogD7aa	Internet Options does not apply.  You need to add the mail button to the Y! Toolbar.  Click the Y! Toolbar Settings button (avatar/picture), click Add/Edit buttons, add the mail button and save the change.
VQdqogD7aa	The IE File, Edit, View, Favorites, Tools and Help buttons are part of the IE Menu Bar which is off by default in IE 7 and IE 8.  Right click an open area around the toolbar and in the drop down list click Menu Bar.
VQdqogD7aa	There's some ambiguity in your question.  If you are talking about removing the IE 7 browser and you are using Vista, then leave IE 7 alone.  If you upgraded from IE 6 to IE 7 and you want to revert back, then uninstall IE 7 in add or remove programs (typically you can't if you installed Windows XP Service Pack 3).  There is a way to uninstall IE and then re-install using a Microsoft Windows/Vista installation CD but you have to research that procedure on the Internet and I advise against doing so.  If you are talking about removing  a third-party Toolbar such as Yahoo, Google, ASK, etc., then follow the vendors uninstall recommendations (look at the vendor's site); however, it typically involves closing the browser first and then going to add or remove programs and clicking Remove or Uninstall.  Firefox toolbars are add-ons that don't appear in add or remove programs and require clicking Tools, click Add-ons and then highlight the entry and click Uninstall.  I suggest leaving IE alone and if you want to install another browser, do so and you can also set it as your default browser.  I currently have IE 8 RC 1, Firefox, Opera, Google Chrome and Safari installed with no problems (IE is set as my default browser).  Hope that answers your question.  Otherwise, add details to your original question.  Good luck.

e63450517215908d3a9a820dd7193140aa	Before you get started, you are requested to enter personal info in "offers" and when you do that, you may even get points - but P-R is an afiliate network and they will send you loads of spam! This has been proven by checking the IP-address, it could be tracked back to P-R. It doesn't work if you try to enter false info upon registration, because P-R uses your IP-address to confirm your identity and they sell your address and your phone number and you get phone calls from salesmen who are rather aggressive and repeatedly harrass you. It has also been reported by several people that P-R installs spyware on your harddrive.<br>  <a href="http://www.rockband.com/forums/showthread.php?p=358886" rel="nofollow">http://www.rockband.com/forums/showthrea...</a><br>  <br>  Testimonial from a user on YouTube: <<...

First, stop using deodorant altogether--instead, use cornstarch (not baby powder, which is abrasive). It's highly absorbent, cheap, and wonderfully smooth. Then, if you wish, try Arm & Hammer deodorant--its active ingredient is baking soda. If that won't work, try Desitin diaper rash ointment VERY sparingly--its base is zinc oxide, and military medics use it on wounds. There are generic versions of it, too. Failing that, go back to corn starch.

T8ksKCWCaa	Too late, you cannot delete resolved questions.|`|ncCWnApDaa	Sorry but the answer is no, once a question becomes resolved the option to delete it is no longer available, the only way it can be removed is if either the question or BA is reported as a violation.|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	You can only delete questions that you asked, and you can only do that while they are still 'open'.

t2M1kXY4aa	A Y!A "fan" is another user who likes your questions/answers and "connects" to you so that he/she can see other questions you ask and answer.<br>  <br>  Your fan connects by mousing over your avatar and clicking on the "Add To My Contacts" option that appears.  That's all it takes ... that person is now your fan.  You get an email from Y!A stating that "____ (Y!A username) has connected to you in Yahoo Answers" and the email explains your options (add that person, view his/her profile, view his/her contacts).<br>  <br>  You are not obligated to do anything or reciprocate or respond in any way unless you wish to.|`|IxuMTGd4aa	Well, to put rather bluntly, you have a stalker! They can see all fo the questions you ask, all fo your answers, your other fans and contacts, and they can do basically whatever they want on your questiosn and answers!<br>  <br>  I INSPECT the people who add me, because I can (usually) tell if they are a Troll (people who are stupid and waste Y!A) and remove them before they can cause any harm.|`|5DyRqEzEaa	Fans are people that enjoy your company.
qb01Zuseaa	go to your question then go to edit and remove it, it takes 5 pts to take off|`|SpcYCBndaa	yea..........what she said|`|zzkmdusEaa	You can try going to the question and click on the "Edit" button and then clicking delete question.<br>  <br>  But I don't think that removes it from your Q&A on your profile it just marks it as "Question Deleted".

N0TuYFQIaa	mine stopped working to, i use my yahoo avatar now.|`|7u77AiBjaa	Double-check that you are using the correct Yahoo services and have followed all the instructions below. Some people confuse the Y!Profile (<a href="http://profiles.yahoo.com">http://profiles.yahoo.com</a> ) with Yahoo! 360 (<a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> ). If you've done everything, then likely you just have to wait for a change to be recognized. You will definitely have to switch to your 360 image setting in your Yahoo! Answers profile to see any change happen:<br>  <br>  <br>  Create a 360 space at <a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> . Click "Get Started" button on the far right section of that page. After going through the activation process, you can click on the teeny tiny "Yahoo 360 Home" link on the upper right of that page (or the 360 main page) to get into the 360 space.<br>  <br>  Make sure a JPEG formatted photo (with .jpg, .jpeg, .jpe extension) under 5MB is saved to your hard drive.<br>  <br>  - Click your "My Page" link at the top<br>  - Click "Edit Profile/Personal Photos" over the empty picture frame<br>  - Click "Browse" and upload photo into an empty field. Then click one "use as primary" radio button on the right before saving (if you've uploaded more than one image).<br>  <br>  You can't upload more than 4 profile pictures (this includes an avatar). Make sure that you are following the 360 Personal Photo guidelines here: <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/guidelines/guidelines-06.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui...</a> .<br>  <br>  Then, come back to Yahoo! Answers.<br>  - Make sure that it is the same Yahoo ID that you used for 360.<br>  - Click the "My Profile" link to the upper right of this Yahoo! Answers page, then click "Edit My Info" in the top left box on the Answers profile page.<br>  - Scroll down to the image section and check the option of showing the 360 picture. Click Preview and then the OK button. Then, WAIT.<br>  <br>  NOTE: The image may not show up right away in Y/A, as it sometimes take hours, days, or weeks for the system to catch up. So, in the meantime, you will be without any picture on Y/A (a gray unisex icon) or an old 360 image. Just go through the above process and let your picture stay that way until the system makes your 360 image appear. If you don't want to wait, then just use a Yahoo! Avatar (<a href="http://avatars.yahoo.com">http://avatars.yahoo.com</a> ) and forget about using the 360 image.<br>  <br>  OTHER TIPS: <br>  *** If the 360 space is recently activated, you may want to wait a few days before changing settings, as Y/A may not recognize that you have a 360 space right away.<br>  *** You may want to enable all the communication options on your Y/A profile and/or enable the Simple URL option in your Yahoo! 360 "Basic Info" and "Blog" settings pages. Sometimes that helps make the Y!360 image appear in your Y/A profile for an unknown reason. You still may have to wait for anything to happen though. <br>  *** Although, some people have found limited success in continually trying to re-select the 360 image option in their Y/A profile. I recommend waiting though, as to not inadvertently cause further delay.<br>  *** Some people never see an image show up. You can always post a bug report (or piggyback on other's bug reports) on the issue at the Y/A forum: <a href="http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answers">http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answe...</a> . This link between Y/A and Y!360 has been buggy for years.
9Ur1VL9Paa	I'd advise you to notify the Yahoo Customer Care team; they should rectify this situation!|`|ncCWnApDaa	The oops message should only appear on suspended accounts, check your spam folder just in case a suspension email turned up there, if it wasn't a suspension and is in fact a glitch, then I would recommend contacting the yahoo answers team directly, <br>  <br>  y_answrs_team@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  That is their email address, simply explain the problem and hopefully they will take care of it.|`|tADSxyqwaa	you're the invisible man! <br>  use your powers only for good!
AQsiugSpaa	Lisa,<br>  <br>  It is a royal pain. In fact it happens so often that what I do now, to protect myself from total frustration, is to copy and paste my response into a file, and, of course the url to the question. <br>  <br>  That way if the answer doesn't go through "Yahoo is taking a coffee break" or whatever the message is, I can just copy the answer from the file and paste it into the answer box. This way I don't lose my work.<br>  <br>  Hope this idea helps,<br>  <br>  Troublesniffer<br>  Who wishes this problem would be resolved.|`|gU34xa9vaa	It drives me mad too.Especially if it's a long reply with links and I forget to copy it just incase it happens,or remember to copy it but have a few windows open, and close the wrong one ! <br>  It seems to be happening more and more often now, I wonder why ?|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	add me to the list of people who hate that.<br>  <br>  they posted my last question twice, some sort of YAHOO compensation for not posting my answers, i guess.|`|UNFxjNHkaa	Haha I know!!!!  I hate it when that happens.  Yahoo was having a lot of issues yesterday - i had to submit an answer like 10 times for it to finally go through|`|suPD7c3gaa	I only have to submit once.  This must be part of what seems to be an on again/off again glitch.  I couldn't submit answers at all a few days ago... and I definitely didn't love it.|`|GdBG4PGYaa	I know! I worked so hard on an answer, and then I can't submit it! So, I copy an paste my answer, open another tab or window and answer the question again. That usually works. If it doesn't then I copy and paste my answer, "submit" it, Y!A says Oops, and then I find the question again. Usually if the first thing I try doesn't work, it means the question was deleted or I had already "submitted" my answer, and I just kept reloading the Oops page. Lol!<br>  <br>  Yeah, so if it doesn't submit the first 2 times I try, it is either because Yahoo! Answers is glitchy, I didn't wait for the computer to load, or the question was deleted.<br>  <br>  So, yes I do "LOVE" it. Lol, sure... :P<br>  Hope I helped!|`|yEMRPW1Aaa	yes i do hate it and i be hitting the button hard too lol.|`|u7vrul2Faa	Yes I absolutely hate it when that happens, especially when I have typed a really lengthy and well researched answer.

When you hit that limit, they USED to post a screen that said "You've hit your limit." Recently, it seems that they are posting the WRONG screen -- and you get the 'technical difficulties' screen instead.

(Yahoo US)<br>  Your only way around this is to open a new account on the Brazilian site and use it specifically for your Brazilian questions. <br>  It's not an ideal solution, but it is the only way I can think of to stop getting your Brazilian questions removed and losing points for violations.

You can't add photo albums to your 360 space either to that "Share Photos" module (which is busted - including the Flickr photostream part) or as an embedded slideshow in a 360 blog entry (due to a flash-object embed glitch).<br>  <br>  Here are your remaining ways to add images to your 360 space:<br>  <br>  MY PAGE/TOP PAGE:<br>  1) PERSONAL PHOTOS PICS MODULE (left side of Top Page):<br>  <br>  Make sure a JPEG formatted photo (with .jpg, .jpeg, .jpe extension) under 5MB is saved to your hard drive.<br>  <br>  - Click your "My Page" link at the top<br>  - Click "Edit Profile Photos" over the empty picture frame<br>  - Click "Browse" and upload photo into an empty field. Then click one "use as primary" radio button on the right before saving.<br>  <br>  You can't upload more than 4 profile pictures (this includes an avatar). Make sure that you are following the 360 Personal Photo guidelines here: <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui...">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui...</a> . You can re-save images in Microsoft Paint (or another photo-editing program) to make sure the image fulfills the specifications.<br>  <br>  However, this module is glitchy. You may not be able to put 4 images in the module. See <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f...">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f...</a> for details.<br>  <br>  <br>  BLOG:<br>  1) Click "My Blog" at the top of your 360 space. Click "Compose Blog Entry" at the top of the page (if you've adjusted your settings once already). Above your entry space, click the "Browse" button for the photo upload tool. Search for the image that's saved to your hard drive. It must be a JPEG formatted image (extension ending with .jpg, .jpeg, and .jpe) and under 5 MB in file size.<br>  * The picture will appear above your entry and doing it this way, you can only use one picture.<br>  <br>  NOTE: The following methods require that your image is hosted via an online hosting service like Flickr (<a href="http://flickr.com" rel="nofollow">http://flickr.com</a> ) and Photobucket (<a href="http://photobucket.com/" rel="nofollow">http://photobucket.com/</a> ):<br>  <br>  2) Check out the 360 team post on dragging & dropping photos into blogs: <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-1qCkw2Eha...">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-1qCkw2Eha...</a> .<br>  * This method allows many photos to be used in an entry, with your choice in placement. Make sure that you are using an image that's on it's own page (not on a page that is shared with others). So click on the image and get to that image's full detail page (likely the largest view of the picture, not the thumbnail).<br>  <br>  3) Copy and paste an absolute URL for the image (which looks <a href="http://www.domainname.com/nameoffile.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.domainname.com/nameoffile.gif</a> or .jpg....something similar to that) into a blog entry.<br>  - Check the box next "View HTML source" box (on the upper right of your entry's space).<br>  - Type in the HTML code:<br>  <img src="URL of image" height="# of pixels" width="# of pixels"><br>  NOTE: With Flickr, just use the block of code above the pic's URL that they tell you to use...wouldn't want to violate their guidelines.<br>  - Uncheck the "View HTML source" box to get back to the regular blog screen.<br>  WARNING: Do not save your entry with out adding some text.<br>  - Click "Save"<br>  * This method allows you to use any formatted image as long as it's hosted on an online server and not only your hard drive. Check each service for their list of accepted file types before choosing one.<br>  <br>  <br>  BACKGROUND:<br>  After logging into 360, click on the "My Page" link next to your "Home" link. Then, at the top under that line of links is the word "Theme: [name of whatever theme you currently have]." Click the "Change Theme" link that's directly under those words.<br>  <br>  On the new page that comes up, there's a paragraph stating "Select a Theme - Change the look of your Yahoo! 360° page by picking a theme. Click "Apply Theme" to make the change." Directly under that click a link called "Customize Your Theme." A new "Customize Your Theme" window will pop up where you can insert .jpg images as well as customize colors.<br>  <br>  Your background picture must be JPEG formatted (.jpg, .jpeg, or .jpe as the extension) and under 250KB in file size. See <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/pro...">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/pro...</a> for a graphic.
qrTEcgbbaa	Error code 40402 is something sent back to Messenger from the Yahoo! Address Book system when you are trying to make a change to the contact. The code translates to: Requested contact to be updated or deleted does not exist. The contact does not exist.<br>  <br>  So my guess is that the contact was already deleted from your Address Book but not from your Messenger list. In that case, I recommend right clicking on the contact in your Messenger list, choosing “Delete” and then NOT checking the box that says “Delete from Address Book too”. That should remove it from your Messenger list and it’s already gone from your address book. If needed, you can go to <a href="http://address.yahoo.com">http://address.yahoo.com</a> to make sure as well.<br>  <br>  Sarah Bacon<br>  <br>  Comment by Administrator — August 28, 2008 #<br>  <br>  from blog<br>  <a href="http://www.ymessengerblog.com/blog/2008/08/20/new-to-messenger-come-to-the-workshop/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ymessengerblog.com/blog/2008/...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  my suggestion is to add contact again
S8KtoFl7aa	if someone deletes you off of their messenger you will still have that same person on your messenger but they will not have the yellow faces even if they do log into their own messenger because you have been removed off of their messenger. They do not have you if they have deleted you, and they will not show up with yellow faces and if they do and they still dont have yellow faces, it could mean too that they are signed in as being invisible and they have the option to be invisible to you for as long as they want  hope this makes sense, <br>  if they have you and you have them on widows live then yes they do have you and they will show up but if they dont have you on yahoo then they will not, hope this helps hon,|`|kJTzXWoPaa	Yes, because they have to be invited, or they have to invite you. That's to be on your list, but almost anyone can contact you, they do not have to know you to do that.<br>  <br>  Luckily, I have Windows Live too, because this site is really about Yahoo Messenger...|`|lJ2baVliaa	Well, when someone has deleted me they remain on my list.

If they do, you, of course, also have to have chosen to allow email, or you wouldn't be able to email within Yahoo! answers.  All email addresses remain anonymous at all times when emailing through Yahoo! Answers.<br>  <br>  Some might suggest you respond by using the edit feature with your question. If you do that, you risk getting reported for chatting.  Yahoo! Answers isn't like many other forums/message boards where there can be a continuous thread to a comment or question

I hope someone has answers.|`|8Jj9U3ygaa	I don't know, but I've had the exact same problem, and also just today. I've re-installed java, set all my internet settings to the exact specifications they want on their help page, restarted my computer multiple times, restarted my browser multiple times, cleared all the caches multiple times, tried both IE and firefox, tried playing a different game, nothing works. I keep getting to the room, it attempts to connect to the games server, and after a few minutes, I get the "Error logging into server" message.<br>  I've tried it a few dozen times now. Also, it seems to be only on my computer or internet connection, because my next-door neighbor, who I sometimes play with, has no problem at all on his, but no other accounts work on mine either.<br>  Someone please help|`|nkuH45Ndaa	I'm having the same problem, I wonder if it's because I'm using dial up? I see people in the rooms playing maybe they have dsl? Not sure what the deal is? Cause I want to play spades so bad!|`|Oai2a19zaa	They're doing updates.  Hopefully we'll have access soon.|`|83800332c2fdc71e2342ee4681bc9518aa	that cmd works i did it too
e494eb1e544153fbeed8117f34b95807aa	If you have your messenger so that it is saving your archives then bring up your messenger, click on 'Contacts', go to 'Messenger Archives' & click on it. Go down the list to Feb 21 & look for the message you are looking for. If you do not have your messenger set to keep the archives if you remember who you chatted with you can contact them & ask if they keep archives & if they do if they are willing to send you copy of the conversation.
olVsHbfVaa	I am having the same issue.  <br>  <br>  My search does not work!  It is very frustrating.<br>  <br>  This function used to work very well.<br>  <br>  If anyone knows the solution, please let me know.<br>  <br>  Thanks,<br>  <br>  John
Zp22sUhAaa	i would google incorrect command parameter and see what you get, or system restore to previous day.
t2M1kXY4aa	3 ways to do it:<br>  <br>  If you've checked the option in your profile to receive an email from Y!A each time you receive a new answer, the link to your Q will be in the email.  Just click it to see your answer.<br>  <br>  If you see your question on the category homepage, click your question ... that will open your question and your answers will be visible there.<br>  <br>  The easiest way (I think) is to just click on your own avatar to open your profile.  Click "My Questions" .  There you will see a list of the questions you've asked ... just click on your question, and you will see your question and all its answers, exactly as it appears in Y!A.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	E-mail or your questions to find it|`|IxuMTGd4aa	Go to:<br>  <br>  My Profile<br>  My Answers<br>  <br>  Rather simple...
7u77AiBjaa	There's no link to your 360 space in your question or your Yahoo! Answers profile, so I can't confirm that you have one. Double-check that you are using the correct Yahoo services and have followed all the instructions below. Some people confuse the Y!Profile (<a href="http://profiles.yahoo.com">http://profiles.yahoo.com</a> ) with Yahoo! 360 (<a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> ). If you've done everything, then likely you just have to wait for a change to be recognized:<br>  <br>  <br>  Create a 360 space at <a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> . Click "Get Started" button on the far right section of that page. After going through the activation process, you can click on the teeny tiny "Yahoo 360 Home" link on the upper right of that page (or the 360 main page) to get into the 360 space.<br>  <br>  Make sure a JPEG formatted photo (with .jpg, .jpeg, .jpe extension) under 5MB is saved to your hard drive.<br>  <br>  - Click your "My Page" link at the top<br>  - Click "Edit Profile/Personal Photos" over the empty picture frame<br>  - Click "Browse" and upload photo into an empty field. Then click one "use as primary" radio button on the right before saving (if you've uploaded more than one image).<br>  <br>  You can't upload more than 4 profile pictures (this includes an avatar). Make sure that you are following the 360 Personal Photo guidelines here: <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/guidelines/guidelines-06.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui...</a> .<br>  <br>  Then, come back to Yahoo! Answers.<br>  - Make sure that it is the same Yahoo ID that you used for 360.<br>  - Click the "My Profile" link to the upper right of this Yahoo! Answers page, then click "Edit My Info" in the top left box on the Answers profile page.<br>  - Scroll down to the image section and check the option of showing the 360 picture. Click Preview and then the OK button. Then, WAIT.<br>  <br>  NOTE: The image may not show up right away in Y/A, as it sometimes take hours, days, or weeks for the system to catch up. So, in the meantime, you will be without any picture on Y/A (a gray unisex icon) or an old 360 image. Just go through the above process and let your picture stay that way until the system makes your 360 image appear. If you don't want to wait, then just use a Yahoo! Avatar (<a href="http://avatars.yahoo.com">http://avatars.yahoo.com</a> ) and forget about using the 360 image.<br>  <br>  OTHER TIPS: <br>  *** If the 360 space is recently activated, you may want to wait a few days before changing settings, as Y/A may not recognize that you have a 360 space right away.<br>  *** You may want to enable all the communication options on your Y/A profile and/or enable the Simple URL option in your Yahoo! 360 "Basic Info" and "Blog" settings pages. Sometimes that helps make the Y!360 image appear in your Y/A profile for an unknown reason. You still may have to wait for anything to happen though. <br>  *** Although, some people have found limited success in continually trying to re-select the 360 image option in their Y/A profile. I recommend waiting though, as to not inadvertently cause further delay.<br>  *** Some people never see an image show up. You can always post a bug report (or piggyback on other's bug reports) on the issue at the Y/A forum: <a href="http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answers">http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answe...</a> . This link between Y/A and Y!360 has been buggy for years.
