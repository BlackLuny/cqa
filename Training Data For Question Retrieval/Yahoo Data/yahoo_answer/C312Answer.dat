AA10065759	There are ONLY THREE ways to get a backstage pass....<br>  <br>  1) You must know someone connected with the tour, more<br>  like a relative that works for the concert. Or, if you are lucky have<br>  a friend in school that has a relative that works for the concert.<br>  <br>  2) Be a news reporter. You would have to be one connected<br>  to your local newspaper or local news TV team.<br>  <br>  3) A local radio station will sometime have a backstage pass<br>  of the concert and offer it as a promotional prize.<br>  Either you have to be the 7th or 10th caller.<br>  Or answer the right question on the air.<br>  Or hope that the entry form you filled out gets picked out<br>  in a drawing.<br>  <br>  Those are the ONLY WAY you will get a backstage pass.<br>  <br>  - - - - - - - - - - - - -|`|jdVxsK4yaa	idk but if u find out get me 1 too!!

sp1TB35Kaa	Have you read the comic? I pregnant woman gets shot in the head. A little girl is devoured by dogs. There is impending nuclear holocaust. There's blood, gore, and blue penis. But it's not the focus of the movie/story so it's perfectly okay for him to go see it with his dad, lol.|`|QPq4j8JNaa	the main character dr. Manhattan walks around the whole movie with his d.ick flapping in the wind,so no it is not a good movie for a kid unless he doesn't mind seeing a big blue penis|`|hvrw02Egaa	Probably not. It had a few sex scenes and a lot of adult content. The violence isn't that bad, but their is a LOT of bad language.|`|yJE7INkUaa	Well<br>  there is a lot of sex, violence and nudity. it is not your average comic book movie|`|JepeaPHsaa	"Watchmen" is rated R for nudity, sexuality and graphic violence. This movie is NOT appropriate for a 6th grader.|`|jLvlcoFBaa	It's WatchMEN.<br>  <br>  An 11 year old should not see this film.<br>  <br>  It is rated R for a reason.|`|AqDson6zaa	There is a sex scene that's basically softcore porn, a near-rape, and a lot of graphic violence (a guy's arms get sawed off, a guy's face gets burned by cooking oil, tons of people get shot, beat up, blown up, etc.).<br>  <br>  Not something I'd want to see with my dad. Or something that a sixth grader should really see. It's not really a superhero movie like Spider-man or even The Dark Knight, these are crazy people that are dressing up in costumes and trying to stop terrible things from happening and a lot of times, failing. Iron Man makes you want to be a superhero, Watchmen makes you hope superheroes never exist.

GNtWomekaa	Apply for group singing lessons. Singing with the group and solo in front of them makes you much more confident because you get used to it.<br>  You can also try out for a choir. Singing with others in front of a crowd is better before you go solo. Plus if you get in, you know you're good!<br>  If you sing with sing star or Karaoke in front of your friends and duets too, this is a fun way to express yourself and gain confidence.<br>  <br>  At the start of my singing i was exactly the same as you. But then i did all of these and i'm fine!<br>  <br>  Good Luck! :)|`|pd8Ujgzfaa	You should take a deep breath and relax. Don't doubt yourself. Trust your friends. If they are truly your friends, than they are accurate in judging your singing ability. If your parents really don't know that you sing, I would try singing in front of them first. Your parents will support you, and this will definitely help you. Also, what I have found from experience is that it is much more difficult to sing in front of your friends and in front of smaller groups of people than it is to sing in front of a packed auditorium. This is because you see your friends on a day to day basis and you can easily see the people in a smaller group. In an auditorium situation, you may not even know most of the people. Also, due to the lighting, you wont even see the audience. From classroom size groups and up (provided that there is at least 15 people in the classroom) you can get away with looking just over everyone's head. You could even combine this technique with closing your eyes when appropriate if you are singing a "powerful" song. As you become more comfortable singing in front of people, you will eventually gain confidence and begin looking at people and not above their head. Finally, and most importantly, confidence comes with experience. The more you sing in front of all sizes of groups of people, the more comfortable you will become. It is up to you to take those first nervous steps onto the stage. Sieze whatever opportunities you may encounter. By the way, the initial nervousness goes away after about the first minute or so. How do I know all this? I was once in your position and now I can sing in front of any crowd, anywhere, at any time.|`|YXYQQ5dbaa	practice singing in front of more people or when u r on stage look at something behind the people like a back door or something and imagine that they are not there

Last April Fool's Day I used this prank on our friend. I made up flyers on my computer that read: <br>  <br>  GWM living with mommy looking for daddy. Prefer big black men, long walks on the beach, and being spanked. Call me anytime (cell phone # of friend). <br>  <br>  I actually didn't place them anywhere but I told my friend I did. About an hour later, he got a phone call from a guy named Leroy (a gay friend of ours). "Leroy" left a message saying that he saw his flyer in the men's room at the 7-11 and that he wanted to meet him. <br>  <br>  That was enough to send our friend over the edge. He was pissed. The best part was when he learned it was our friend that called him....whenever he saw "Leroy" at our house he would flirt with him, rub his leg, talk sweet and dirty to him. This went on for about a month. "Leroy was actually gay". My victim of the joke was an idiot and didn't believe me for the longest time.<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  <br>  This one is simple, but very effective -- even more so if the victim has been on vacation, and away from computers for a while. Simply switch the "M" and "N" keycaps on their keyboard. Most office workers these days only partially touch-type. It's a big bonus if their password contains an "M" or and "N." Their frustration at not being able to log in is hilarious.<br>  <br>  <br>  αм?яι￠αи ?α? я υ?? ツ ☆|`|sJNoTGQVaa	duct tape her hair to her pillow when she's sleeping|`|D6Xfc5Wtaa	hahaha, wait until she falls asleep and then put her hand in warm water.<br>  Or you could buy her some twinkies and suck all of the cream out of the middle and replace it with toothpaste.<br>  Same works with oreos.<br>  <br>  idk<br>  lol, have fun!|`|vdT9VkZoaa	youtube <br>   bird in cereal<br>  probably the 1st one|`|pauzBlpgaa	hahahahh to the first answer.<br>  <br>  but give her a haircut<br>  <br>  or throw something in the shower while she's in there|`|4qiiuv6Xaa	Get one of those shocking pens.

She has all the money in the world she doesn't need to stick with a DB like that.

Maybe b/c they wish they could have experienced the same thing, "I Know do" It sounds like soooo much fun. : ) : ) : )  <br>  <br>  My Favorite has to be Jon & Kate because they seem all round to be a normal family. Its not like they planed this to happen, Kate only had two pregnancy. I mean its not like she's crazy and just wants a large family and continues to get pregnant like "OctoMom."|`|EcwfIdZPaa	I've been wondering that myself :)<br>  <br>  Of course, I watch J & K every week and just feel grateful that I have only 3 kids!  :)|`|AA12111193	ummm <br>  TLC <br>  T-tender <br>  L- love <br>  C- care <br>  explains why there are so many shows about families with children and alot of kids|`|8HDCGe5uaa	Is there any information the new show Table for 12.  Add shows another set of sextuplets.  I have not found it online.|`|lO2Nvj81aa	Because TLC has realized that exploiting families with large numbers of children (17 Kids and Counting, Jon and Kate Plus Eight, Table for Twelve), or families living with extraordinary circumstances (Little People Big World) brings in lots of money.
urs9AxiGaa	Kinda, IDK??? I guess Reality T.V. Show Celebrities. ( They certainly well known)<br>  I think they should win an award for Best Reality Show. <br>  <br>  Either way I don't care, I love watching their show along with Little People Big World.  : ) : ) : )|`|03xi1bToaa	ha no way like if i saw them i wouldnt ask them for their autographs, but i would go like o hey its them!|`|DTMcfGc4aa	No, they're just regular kids who star in a reality show.|`|Ai6vvh5Faa	not at all! they have a show on TLC...that doenst make them celebrities|`|rHaK3WKDaa	i would. i mean, think about it.<br>  they have their own tv show, cameras follow them around their house every single day, they go on talkshows and paparazzi take pics of them!|`|k39bNUgeaa	No they will never be considered celebrities|`|oKvyaIPSaa	no way

Almost all the things I liked, discovered we both liked. From that you can take the answer as: just be yourself and if they like you, then being yourself is enough.<br>  <br>  Use the following basic rules:<br>  <br>  * Don't try to be something you're not.<br>  * Be honest about what you believe in<br>  * Don't lie about yourself (it'll catch you out later)<br>  * Show you're interesting <br>  * Have a sparkling personality<br>  <br>  After that it's just be in the right place at the right time with good friends, and from there you'll meet some one who will at first like you the in due course love you for who and what you really are.<br>  <br>  There's a cliche, I'm using the hollywood thinking here, from a film called A Bronx Tale. Sonny the gangster (Chazz Palminteri) said something like "In your life you'll meet three members of the opposite sex, the first will be a good friend, the second will be your best friend, and the third will be the one you marry" - and that's still mostly true when looking for your ideal partner.<br>  <br>  So there you go, and for those who are in safe and secure long term relationships, I say well done and do you have a good friend who might be good for me?|`|niZBsn9Qaa	well....if you are a man,<br>  <br>  you have to be sweet and kind and considerate and know how to dance, hopefully play an instrument, be macho and strong but sensitive and gentle, love animals, love kids, be romantic, never lie, dress well, money and a nice car helps, have a job, have ambition, want to go to college and or already graduated from college, like long walks on the beach and long talks, know exactly what to say and when to say it, be spontaneous, generous and kind to strangers.

Not I! Movie – it too has a star in or a cameo who wore mask – cast are livewires. <br>  <br>  Soda-pop straws are sold, as part-encased a hot tin, I saw it in mad dog I met. Is dog rosy? Tie-dye booths in rocks. <br>  <br>  All ewes lessen ill. I see sheep in Syria? He, not I, deep in Syria, has done. No one radio drew old one. <br>  <br>  Many moths – I fondle his; no lemons are sold. Loot delis, yob, moths in a deli bundle his tin. Pins to net a ball I won – pins burst input. I loot to get a looter a spot paler. Arm a damsel – doom a dam. Not a base camera was in a frost, first on knees on top spot. Now a camera was a widened dam. <br>  <br>  Ask: Cold, do we dye? No, hot – push tap, set on to hosepipe. Nuts in a pod liven. <br>  <br>  A chasm regrets a motto of a fine veto of wars. Too bad – I all won. A sadist sent cadets – a war reign a hero derides. A bad loser, a seer, tossed a cradle – he begat to cosset – a minaret for Carole, Beryl, Nora. We’re not as poor to self. <br>  <br>  I risk cold as main is tidal. As not one to delay burden, I don’t set it on “hot”. A foot made free pie race losses runnier. As draw won pull, eye won nose. Vile hero saw order it was in – even a moron saw it – no, witnessed it: Llama drops – ark riots. Evil P.M. in a sorer opus enacts all laws but worst arose. Grab a nosey llama – nil lesser good, same nicer omen. <br>  <br>  In pins? No, it is open. If a top spins, dip in soot. <br>  <br>  Madam, as I desire, dictates: Pull aside, damsels, I set a rag not for a state bastion. A test I won e.g. a contest I won. <br>  <br>  Kidnap, in part, an idle hero. Megastars, red, rosy, tied no tie. Blast! A hero! We do risk a yeti’s opposition! <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  He too has a wee bagel still up to here held. <br>  <br>  Demigods pack no mask, cap nor a bonnet, for at last a case is open – I left a tip – it wets. A dog wets too. Radios to help pay my tip, pull a tip. <br>  <br>  Ale, zoo beer, frets yon animal. Can it? New sex arose but, we sots, not to panic – it’s ale – did I barrel? Did I lose diadem, rare carrot in a jar of mine? Droop as tops sag – unseen knots. <br>  <br>  A cat ate straw as buck risk cud; evil foe, nil a red nag ate? Bah! Plan it – silage. Model foot in arboreta. <br>  <br>  I, dark Satanist, set fire – voodoo – to slat. I design a metal as parrot, I deem it now. One vast sum is no ten in set – amen! Indeed, nine drag a yam, nine drag a tie. Dame nabs flower; can we help man? Woman is worse nob. <br>  <br>  Mud level rose, so refill a rut. A nag of iron I made to trot I defied – I risk leg and its ulnae. Can a pen I felt to bid dollar or recite open a crate, open a cradle, his garret? <br>  <br>  Sample hot Edam in a pan. I’m a rotten digger – often garden I plan, I agreed; All agreed? Aye, bore ensign; I’d a veto – I did lose us site. Wool to hem us? No, cotton. Site pen in acacias or petals a last angel bee frets in. <br>  <br>  I met a gorilla (simian); a mate got top snug Noel fire-lit role. Manet, Pagnol, both girdle his reed bogs. <br>  <br>  Flan I reviled, a vet nods to order it, Bob, and assign it. Totem users go help mates pull as eye meets eye. Son – mine – pots a free pie, yes? No. Left a tip? Order a dish to get. A ring is worn – it is gold. Log no Latin in a monsignor, wet or wise. Many a menu to note carrot. <br>  <br>  Cat in a boot loots; As I live, do not tell! A bare ***, as flat on fire, I know loots guns, fires a baton, nets a hero my ale drop made too lax. <br>  <br>  If it is <br>  <br>  <br>  to rain, a man is a sign; I wore macs, no melons rot. I use moths if rats relive, sir, or retire. <br>  <br>  Vendor pays: I admire vendee, his pots net roe. Nine dames order an opal fan; I’ll ask cold log fire vendor to log igloo frost. Under Flat Six exist no devils. <br>  <br>  Marxist nods to Lenin. To Lenin I say: “Mama is a deb, besides a bad dosser.” <br>  <br>  Gen it up to get “ova” for “egg”. I recall a tarot code: yell at a dessert side-dish sale. Yes/nos a task cartel put correlate: E.S.P. rocks a man. I am a man, am no cad, I’m aware where it’s at! <br>  <br>  Fire! Its an ogre-god to help, man, as I go. Do not swap; draw, pull a troll! <br>  <br>  It’s not a cat I milk – calf, for a fee, sews a button - knit or tie damsel over us. Mined gold lode I fill until red nudes I met in a moor-top bar can. I sit, I fill a diary – trap nine men in ten-part net – oh, sir, I ask, cod nose? No, damp eel. <br>  <br>  So, to get a name! I say, Al! I am Al! Last, I felt, to breed, deer begat. <br>  <br>  To can I tie tissue – damp – or deliver Omani artist – a man of Islam. <br>  <br>  In a den mad dogs lived on minis a signor who lived afore targets in at. As eremites pull, I, we, surf, fantasise, mend a bad eye. No hero met satyr; Tony, as I stressed, won’t, so cosset satyr. <br>  <br>  A vet on isles made us sign it, a name. Foe man one sub. <br>  <br>  Aside no dell I fret a wallaby; metal ferrets yodel, like so. On a wall I ate rye. Bored? No, was I rapt! One more calf? O.K., calf, one more, bossy! No!

Z8qBgv8taa	EDIT- I would just like to add that I care because this pop star and icon to many young women in our society is setting an example for impressionable youngsters as to what's acceptable in a romantic relationship and what is not. 1 in 5 teenage girls and young women admit to violence in their romantic relationships. I don't want my child to be a statistic and neither should anyone else. She should be showing young girls how to stand up for themselves. This matter should not be ignored and pushed aside like our nation does with domestic violence a lot of times. It's not pretty to look at but it's real. I lived the life and wish I had someone to look up to in that time. A pop star I liked who stood up for herself so I could say "Rihanna did it and I can too." A lot of girls just lost their opportunity to do that based on her choices. <br>  <br>  Posted on 2009-03-05<br>  <br>  Speculation has been spreading like wildfire across media outlets that the two troubled R&B vocalists have apparently tied the knot after reconciling sometime last week in Miami Beach at Diddy’s Star Island mansion. According to Star Magazine, Chris Brown proposed to Rihanna after the both engaged in a heartfelt and tearful apology, she accepted. And instead of allowing wait time, rumors are stating that the two arranged a quaint and impromptu wedding at Diddy’s estate.<br>  <br>  A source close to Rihanna told Star Magazine that it was something she was waiting for regardless of all the drama that ensued over the close of the month:<br>  <br>  "All she’s ever wanted was to be with him forever. Rihanna is looking for the husband-and-two-kids deal before she turns 25. She believes in fairy tales, and she wants to live hers with Chris. She was totally up front and confessed to him, ‘I can’t live without you.’"<br>  <br>  At press time, Chris Brown will be arraigned in court today (March 5) where is likely that he will plead guilty and receive a plea bargain because of the alleged reconciling. However, if the plea bargain isn’t assessed, Brown could face up to 4 years in a state penitentiary.|`|RLco6kl9aa	So not true!<br>  They were planning to but I think they will hold it off for a little while!<br>  Rihanna wants two babies, a husband and a house before she is 25!|`|T1c2H89daa	I haven't heard about it but everyone else:<br>  Answer the f**king question.<br>  She doesn't give a sh*t about your opinion.|`|ujnwIQhSaa	celebrity gossip is dumb, who cares...there just ppl.

They also have a harder time jumping.<br>  D) Pumas climb trees, elephants don't. I like climbing trees<br>  E) They're cats, and I've always been interested in cats<br>  <br>  I have a couple of other reasons as well, but I can't really word them right. *stresses*|`|MQL6OISlaa	Puma... elephants get shot for their ivory and are relatively easy targets. Puma's are hunted as dangerous animals, but they are harder to hit.... not to mention they sound cooler....|`|EcIwl0tDaa	Puma,<br>  <br>  Elephants are fatties!|`|T6WYXtdfaa	i'd rather be a puffalump.|`|H2koZl82aa	puma: kuz their awsum|`|DBUmR8FTaa	elephant don't know what a puma is|`|0b93ff82dfd58d1b2ebd290e3e0d91b4aa	an elephant= cause they stand there ground and they are powerful|`|U3KtZPwMaa	OH MY GOSH PUMA|`|UquxJBwVaa	puma! <br>  pumas are awesome. <br>  and elephants are huge and loud. haha|`|Z0QWKmUhaa	Elephant.

jLvlcoFBaa	The 6th Day (2000)<br>  <br>  Arnold Schwarzenegger ... Adam Gibson <br>  <br>  In the near future, cloning is now technically advanced, but human cloning is still illegal. Adam Gibson (Schwarzenegger) returns home after working with his friend Hank Morgan (Rapaport), only to find a clone of himself with his family. Before he has chance to find out the truth, he is attacked by a group who want him dead. Adam must escape and find out the truth from the creator of the clones, Michael Drucker (Goldwyn). Adam knows for sure you couldn't have been cloned, but isn't ready for what he's about to hear.|`|JepeaPHsaa	I think you're talking about "The Island" with Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson.

EZf00NJJaa	He was not the cause of the riot ,<br>  this was used as an example of symbolism depicting the religious intolerance that is widely prevalent in today's times .|`|GcoLseVqaa	no, i think he was just some little kid trying to get extra money.  the riot was caused because the Hindus hated the Muslims, so they attacked and killed them.|`|7FJae3Lmaa	no he wasnt.. it was sorta strange wasnt it. But i just assumed that he was one of the Hindu's son?

BUT! not only this, I believe he was a part of the riot. He was "standing in a menacing pose", and dressed as the God of the Hindu people that were attacking the Muslims (hope I'm getting that part right).<br>  <br>  For more, check out the comments from the source:|`|LmvFucdyaa	no idea..i wondered the same thing, i thought it was to signify the conflict between the hindus and the muslims, but im not sure..sorry|`|SmOefD5Raa	No, it was the thing that saved him/her. The Hindus were attacking all the Muslims.<br>  They (Hindus) love their Gods and it's normal to have children dress up as them.|`|nIkkU2nFaa	@ Jim K: I thought the Rama kid died and we saw him floating there in a pool?

Jones and the Temple later moved to California, and both gained notoriety with the move of the Temple's headquarters to San Francisco in the mid-1970s.<br>  <br>  To the extent the actions in Jonestown were viewed as a mass suicide, it is one of the largest such mass suicides in history, and the greatest single loss of American civilian life in a non-natural disaster until the events of September 11, 2001. One of those who died at the nearby airstrip was Leo Ryan, who became the only Congressman murdered in the line of duty in the history of the United States.<br>  Contents<br>  [hide]<br>  <br>      * 1 Early life<br>      * 2 Building the Temple<br>            o 2.1 Indiana beginnings<br>            o 2.2 Integrationist<br>            o 2.3 "Rainbow family"<br>            o 2.4 Asylum<br>            o 2.5 California Eden<br>      * 3 Move to San Francisco<br>      * 4 Jonestown's formation and operation<br>            o 4.1 New children<br>            o 4.2 Pressure and waning political support<br>      * 5 Visit by Congressman Ryan, murders and mass suicide<br>            o 5.1 Port Kaituma Airstrip shootings<br>            o 5.2 Deaths in Jonestown<br>      * 6 Other issues<br>      * 7 Family aftermath<br>            o 7.1 Marceline<br>            o 7.2 Stephan, Jim Jr. and Tim Jones<br>            o 7.3 Lew, Agnes and Suzanne Jones<br>            o 7.4 John Stoen and Kimo<br>      * 8 Notes<br>      * 9 References<br>      * 10 Bibliography<br>      * 11 External links<br>  <br>  [edit] Early life<br>  Lynetta Putnam Jones, the mother of Jim Jones<br>  <br>  Jim Jones was born in Crete, Indiana, a rural community near the Ohio border,[1] to James Thurman Jones (July 1, 1887 – May 29, 1951), a World War I veteran, and Lynetta Putnam (April 16, 1902 – December 11, 1977).[2] He would later claim part Cherokee descent through his mother, though this was likely false.[3][note 1] Economic difficulties during the Great Depression necessitated that Jones' family move to nearby Lynn, Indiana in 1934.[4] Jim Jones and, later, a journalism professor who grew up in Lynn both claimed that Jones' father was in the Ku Klux Klan.[4]<br>  <br>  In interviews for the 2007 documentary Jonestown: The Life and Death of Peoples Temple, childhood acquaintances recalled Jones as being a "really weird kid" who was "obsessed with religion ... obsessed with death", and claimed that he frequently held funerals for small animals, and had purportedly fatally stabbed a cat.[5]<br>  <br>  Jones was a voracious reader as a child and studied Joseph Stalin, Karl Marx, Mahatma Gandhi and Adolf Hitler carefully,[6] noting each of their strengths and weaknesses.[6] After Jones' parents separated, he moved with his mother to Richmond, Indiana.[7] Jones graduated from Richmond High School early and with honors in the winter of 1948-49.[8]<br>  <br>  Jones married Marceline Baldwin, a nurse, in 1949 and moved to Bloomington, Indiana.[9] Jones attended Indiana University at Bloomington, where a speech by Eleanor Roosevelt about the plight of African Americans impressed him.[9] Jones' sympathetic statements about communism offended Marceline's grandmother.[9] In 1951, Jones moved to Indianapolis, where he attended night school at Butler University, earning a degree in secondary education in 1961.[10]<br>  <br>  [edit] Building the Temple<br>  <br>  [edit] Indiana beginnings<br>  Further information: Peoples Temple<br>  <br>  In 1951, Jones became a member of the Communist Party USA, and began attending meetings and rallies in Indianapolis.[11] Jones became flustered with harassment he received during the McCarthy Hearings,[11] particularly regarding meetings between Jones and his mother with Paul Robeson.[12] He also became frustrated with what he perceived to be ostracism of open communists in the United States, especially during the trial of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.[13] This frustration, among other things, provoked a seminal moment for Jones in which he asked himself "how can I demonstrate my Marxism? The thought was, infiltrate the church."[12][11]<br>  <br>  Jones' interest in religion began during his childhood, primarily because he found making friends difficult, though initially he vacillated on his church of choice.[3] Jones was surprised when a Methodist superintendent helped Jones to get a start in the church even though he knew Jones to be a communist and Jones did not meet him through the American Communist Party.[13] In 1952, Jones became a student pastor in Sommerset Southside Methodist Church, but left that church because its leaders barred him from integrating blacks into his congregation.[11] Around this time, Jones witnessed a faith-healing service at the Seventh Day Baptist Church.[11] He observed that it attracted people and their money and concluded that,|`|uvICu0gNaa	this:<br>  Tage gehen vorbei<br>  Ohne da zu sein<br>  Alles war so gut<br>  Alles ich und du<br>  Geh<br>  Geh<br>  <br>  Wir haben nichts falsch gemacht<br>  Die ganze Zeit gedacht<br>  So k?nnt es weiter gehen<br>  Alles andere werden wir sehen<br>  Geh<br>  Geh<br>  <br>  Geh, lass uns hinter dir und mir<br>  Versuch nicht zu verstehen<br>  Warum es nicht mehr geht<br>  Geh, versuch uns beide zu verlieren<br>  Für uns wird′s erst weitergehen<br>  Wenn wir uns nicht mehr sehen<br>  Geh<br>  Geh!<br>  <br>  Geh<br>  Tu′s für dich und mich<br>  Ich k?nnt′ es nicht<br>  Ich h?tte nicht den Mut<br>  Alles ich und du<br>  Geh<br>  Geh<br>  <br>  Tage gehen vorbei<br>  Ohne da zu sein<br>  Deine Spuren führ′n zu mir<br>  Soweit weg von dir<br>  Geh<br>  Geh<br>  <br>  Geh, lass uns hinter dir und mir<br>  Versuch nicht zu verstehen<br>  Warum es nicht mehr geht<br>  Geh, versuch uns beide zu verlieren<br>  Für uns wird′s erst weitergehen<br>  Wenn wir uns nicht mehr sehen<br>  Geh<br>  Geh!<br>  <br>  Ich brech′ das Licht<br>  Die Schatten fallen auf mich<br>  Ich seh' uns nicht<br>  Alle Schatten fallen auf mich<br>  Auf mich<br>  Schatten fallen auf mich<br>  <br>  Tage gehen vorbei<br>  Ohne da zu sein<br>  Das ist alles was uns bleibt<br>  Wenn du gehst<br>  Wenn du jetzt gehst<br>  Versuch nich' zu verstehen<br>  Warum es nich' mehr geht<br>  Geh<br>  Versuch uns beide zu verlieren<br>  Für uns wird′s erst weitergehen<br>  Wenn wir uns nicht mehr sehen<br>  Geh<br>  Geh!<br>  <br>  Tage gehen vorbei<br>  Ohne da zu sein<br>  Bleib...|`|5sTPhPGiaa	The Throne Room song from "Star Wars, Episode IV: A New Hope" (see below).|`|PmNf0YICaa	Lyrics to "Bell the Cat" by LM.C<br>  <br>  Before that was a picture that my friend drew of my and my boyfriend.

It's mainstream, I guess.<br>  <br>  I think that rock bands aren't actually considered crappy by what time period they're from, but from what type of music they produce.

S4Bz3Rivaa	The ones that stand out? It'll be the ones that get most exposure. -_-; But that doesn't mean that they're the best. :)<br>  <br>  I don't really think much songs will stand out, as many of the popular songs these days are hip-hop and don't stay on the charts for long.<br>  <br>  Guess we'll wait and see, huh?|`|Z7c5d0nuaa	...Mgmt and Silversun pickups...I'm sure there's a few more but...not much..<br>  <br>  Oh god, I hate those bands you mentioned...|`|t7U9rliVaa	Um, no.  If anything, they will be infamous, along with the majority of modern mainstream. My first thought was Radiohead.|`|tmSGGJIOaa	Probably mostly rap songs since that seems to be the most popular form of music today. I'm thinking probably some green day and some other punk rock. But mostly rap songs. Milli- Lil Wayne for sure... But you never know ive never heard of rap songs that were still listened to today from the 90s and i still hear classic rock on the radio all the time so its kind of hard to tell.|`|FtLXVUtTaa	My guess would be stuff like radiohead, nine inch nails, and more of the bands known for bringing something new to the table.  I would say Radiohead is one of the most ingenuitive bands of the last 10 years.I doubt fall out boy will be played in the future.  They are just another pop band.  They haven't done anything any other band hasn't done before.|`|LJJ38fVKaa	I don't think FOB's songs are gonna stand out...  haha... let's give them 2 years... I predict no one will remember them... PLEASE GOD!

(probably happens because i talk to actors and comedians pretty commonly)  but it's still mostly anyone, they can just get away with it a lot easier on me because they know how to lie REALLY. WELL. lol<br>  <br>  well, a blonde moment i had today was when i was talking to some friends and someone mentioned being on a boat.  and i remembered this song i like a lot, ("i'm on a boat" by the lonely island)  and i said "oohh!! has anyone heard that song?!"  and they all said no (including one of the comedians i talk to a lot)  so i started getting my ipod out of my bag to play the song and he had to say "no, no. we were kidding, we've all heard it. don't worry about it.  so i didn't feel too bright that out of a room of 8 people including myself i couldn't tell that one of them was kidding.<br>  <br>  wow, i am gullable...<br>  <br>  but a list of blonde moments with me could go on for a while...|`|f6cf03ec268eabd9e8c30b058668e3fdaa	lol i saw a familiar car and i was like hey is that dad in the van and they said emily were in the van lol|`|Wv8hdSTAaa	i'm not even a blonde and people call me a blonde! so ( if i can say) the worst blonde mment i had was when i was in woods and a kid was explaining to me what a belt sander was and isaid " i cant use it because i dont have a belt." people dont believe me i was kidding|`|m8alP5kPaa	I'm not blonde, but once I lost my car keys...looked ALL over for them for about an hour...found them in the ignition.

It was the worst! I stood there for a few seconds and was like "Oh my gosh!!" and walked off the bus. I felt so stupid!<br>  <br>  It was pretty bad... and since I'm ALWAYS the last person on (because I run late all the time), everybody saw.

I started going to her house but as I hadn′t a drivers license at that time her parents picked me up in a huge van that they had.  The girl was really pretty so I  was happy to get in when she came to get me, but as I entered, it was her, her parents and her huge labradour.  Of course the two of us sat in the back with the lab between us.  it was leaning it′s legs against the girl, that I shall call Cindy.  and every now and then this great big spotted beast of a dog would pop me one in the mouth with his paw.  having just been snuck in the face I got scared but laughed it off as this girl and her family so easily had.  finally as we′re about to get to her house, her dog, this sob, punched me in the mouth again.  And, wow, again, I wasn′t bleading but I felt sore on my lip from a sharp dog claw brushing my face.  I felt like I wanted to cry, but couldn′t do so in front of this girl and her family.  Either way, arriving to her house didn′t make things any better, as we played pool, hung out with her younger dorky 13 yr. old brother that I shall just call Dewie.  As the game started to finish, the parents decided it was too late and they had to drive me back to my town, (of course with the dog of a thousand sucker punches) in the ride.  Worst date of my life.  I really used that as an example of why I needed a license and my own car right away.  But this all happened trying to get with a blonde.|`|46932e299a057eec247337f7bca2654baa	theres a million!!! haha... once a while ago when i was at school i was trying to put glue on something... but it wouldn't come out and i got rly mad and everything.... then my friend asked...

kaK9nprbaa	With me it's an idea or maybe a line or two that just pops into my head out of the blue and then I expand on it.  Keeps growing like a vine until the lyrics are written.  Thought processes are hard to explain sometimes.  I can say lyric writing is easy for some, hard for some and impossible for others.  I've been blessed enough to just come up with them off the top of my head sometimes, freaking people out to say the least. Keep a small notebook with you at all times, you never know when inspiration will strike.  Not everything that starts out as a verse, will end up being a full fledged song...at least not at the time you initially put it down on paper.  You can always go back and expand on something when the mood hits you.   :-)|`|MbbgO3Knaa	Look for some inspiration. It could be something that interests you or lyrics based on feelings. It could also be a song about something that has happened to you or something that tells a story. <br>  <br>  Then think of a tune for your song. It's important to pick a genre first so you know if you want to write a slow sad song or a loud happy song. <br>  <br>  Then of course you need music but there's your lyrics part for you.|`|dW3HSba3aa	I write what I feel. Umm mostly I just like thinking about it and it gets stuck in my head so I write it down then within a couple mins I got a song!!|`|sMerTT0zaa	You just wirte what you feel. There is no way to just wirte it isn't a certain thing.|`|Kdr9CRbqaa	it's all inspiration, and what interests you to write about. though i may say that some people are NOT born to write lyrics lol. my sister doesn't even know how to write a poem, she doesn't know what rhymes with dog.lol. but, yea some ppl are naturally born writers.|`|5SsVct7Vaa	you get the pen and a paper and you write. Topic? don't worry about the topic.|`|SYJhGXu4aa	be creative. think of a certain person and then write the whole song about them and make it emotionally envoking so the person who reads it will have their heart strings pulled. like about someone you fell in love with, the smell of them, their smile, how you made them feel blahblah. or a song about lost friendships or tragedies and how it made you stronger and grow or something.|`|CzICREkiaa	write from the bottom of your heart...remember that you're telling a story..and you're giving out a message to the world...write what ever u feel like writing...you should find the mood...whether it is around a crowd of people or in a silent peaceful room by yourself...<br>  what ever you perfere...<br>  remember write from the bottom of your heart...|`|LOfZNNdfaa	I love ducks<br>  your question sucks<br>  this is how I write<br>  My song is tight<br>  Just write <br>  Just write<br>  That is how to write<br>  aight|`|vD1w9wqVaa	Just think of the message u want to send.

I think what will happen is that everyone who has died, along with Galactica will be brought back or resurrected.  Starbuck is the bringer of death.  I think that means that she will show them the way by showing that they all have to die and be brought back in order to complete their journey.|`|a231cd46589d3ea6efabcc68cdd6e69baa	The series has always been about more than just the ship.

b893a8a1520309a25214781a3ec6e4cfaa	Extra-virgin olive oil comes from virgin oil production only, contains no more than 0.8% acidity, and is judged to have a superior taste. <br>  Virgin olive oil comes from virgin oil production only, has an acidity less than 2%, and is judged to have a good taste. <br>  Pure olive oil. Oils labeled as Pure olive oil or Olive oil are usually a blend of refined and virgin production oil. <br>  Olive oil is a blend of virgin and refined production oil, of no more than 1.5% acidity. It commonly lacks a strong flavor.|`|nKnc90jnaa	Types of Olive Oil<br>  Rich, beautiful, and fragrant, olive oil is much like wine -- taste is a matter of personal preference. The many variables that go into the production of olive oil yield dramatic differences in color, aroma, and flavor. And several names are used to differentiate all of these versions, which you'll learn about here.<br>  <br>  The following factors impact the taste of olive oil:<br>  Variety of olive used<br>  <br>  Location and soil conditions where the olives were grown<br>  <br>  Environmental factors and weather during the growing season<br>  <br>  Olive ripeness<br>  <br>  Timing of the harvest<br>  <br>  Harvesting method<br>  <br>  Length of time between the harvest and pressing<br>  <br>  Pressing technique<br>  <br>  Packaging and storage methods<br>  Olive oils are graded by production method, acidity content, and flavor. The International Olive Oil Council (IOOC) sets quality standards that most olive-oil-producing countries use, but the United States does not legally recognize these benchmarks. Instead, the U.S. Department of Agriculture uses a different system that was set up before the IOOC existed. However, American olive growers and oil importers are encouraging the USDA to adopt standards similar to those of the IOOC.<br>  <br>  Where in the World?<br>  <br>  When buying olive oil, you'll see varieties from all over the globe. Most of the world's supply is produced from olives grown in Spain, Italy, and Greece, but other areas, including France and California, are in on the fun, too. Here's what you need to know about olive oil and geography:<br>  Spanish olive oil is typically golden yellow with a fruity, nutty flavor. Spain produces about 45 percent of the world's olive supply.<br>  <br>  Italian olive oil is often dark green and has an herbal aroma and a grassy flavor. Italy grows about 20 percent of the world's olives.<br>  <br>  Greek olive oil packs a strong flavor and aroma and tends to be green. Greece produces about 13 percent of the world's olive supply.<br>  <br>  French olive oil is typically pale in color and has a milder flavor than other varieties.<br>  <br>  Californian olive oil is light in color and flavor, with a bit of a fruity taste.<br>  Olives from different countries are often blended together to produce an oil variety. Or, olives from diverse areas of one country may be combined. These bulk-blended oils are the most economical but are still high quality. On the other hand, some producers only use olives that are grown in a specific area of a country. These regional oils are usually known for their unique flavors.<br>  <br>  Estate olive oils are the cream of the crop. Estate oils are produced using olives from a single olive farm. These olives are usually handpicked, then pressed and bottled right at the estate. Expect to get the best flavor out of these varieties, but also expect to pay more.<br>  <br>  Making the Grades<br>  <br>  There are three basic grades of edible olive oil, and several types within each grade. Extra virgin includes "premium extra virgin" and "extra virgin"; virgin comprises "fine virgin," "virgin," and "semifine virgin"; and olive oil includes what used to be called "pure olive oil" and "refined oil."<br>  <br>  All types of extra-virgin and virgin oils are made from the first pressing of the olives, which removes about 90 percent of the olives' juice. Chemicals and high heat are not allowed in the production of extra-virgin or virgin oils -- no further processing or refining occurs after the pressing process. Neither extra-virgin nor virgin oils are allowed to contain any refined olive oil.<br>  <br>  Virgin olive oils. At the head of the olive oil class sit the extra-virgins, followed closely by the virgins. The difference between two oils and where they rank in the following hierarchy may be just half a percentage point of acidity. However, that is all it takes to distinguish between a very good oil and a great oil.<br>  <br>  "Premium extra-virgin olive oil" is nature's finest, thanks to its extremely low acidity (possibly as low as 0.225 percent). It is best suited for using uncooked in dishes where you can appreciate its exquisite aroma and flavor. Try it in salads, as a dip for bread, or as a condiment.<br>  <br>  "Extra-virgin olive oil" has a fruity taste and may be pale yellow to bright green in color. In general, the deeper the color, the more flavor it yields. IOOC regulations say extra-virgin olive oil must have a superior flavor and contain no more than 0.8 percent acidity, but other regulators set the acidity cut-off point at 1 percent. As with the premium version, it is best to use extra-virgin olive oil uncooked in order to appreciate its flavor.<br>  <br>  "Fine virgin olive oil" must have a "good" taste (as judged by IOOC standards) and an acidity level of no more than 1.5 percent. Fine virgin olive oil is less expensive than extra-virgin oil but is close in quality and is good uncooked.<br>  <br>  "Virgin olive oil" must have a "good" taste, and its acidity must be 2 percent or less. Like other virgin oils, it cannot contain any refined oil. Virgin olive oil is good for cooking, but it also has enough flav|`|178c62ab0689e0d2d6ea1ea7b82f3325aa	Extra Virgin Olive Oil is before Popeye has his spinach - ordinary olive oil is after he's had it..spinach.& ..olive that is!<br>  <br>  In reality it's refers to the purity of filtration of the Oil.|`|eo0DKI0qaa	extra-virgin olive oil is more pure and has a complex molecular build-up so you can digest it|`|gfm3fQubaa	the time from when the olives are picked to when the oil is made|`|A5ctEDmvaa	See link.|`|BZEDobdzaa	one is not a virgin, one is a virgin, and one is EXTRA virgin|`|2N41FbFZaa	you should post this in the food category if you dont want people to make jokes...|`|qTHkBmH6aa	well this is the joke section...<br>  <br>  αм?яι￠αи ?α? я υ?? ツ ☆

They could easily annoy the shh out of each other after a while. <br>  <br>  I think the sexes can have an effect though too. <br>  A pisces girl with a leo guy would probably work out better than a pisces guy with a leo girl|`|Q4Hk5Kvpaa	Not usually.<br>  They don't work out very well together.|`|821bd483afcea62cd9c3a4d1aa91236caa	well, besides the astrology compatibility thing, i'd say maybe.<br>  <br>  pisces is attracted to strong personalities, so that wouldn't be a problem when near a leo personality.<br>  <br>  leo, however, might become attracted to pisces. <br>  i think leos are misunderstood, they are stereotyped as the conceited attention whore types, most of the leos i have met aren't like this, they are very friendly though, but in love, they can fall head over heals for anyone. <br>  <br>  attraction and compatibility are two big different things,.. as for compatibility... they might work out.|`|tc5XLjUEaa	I honestly dont think that Leos can comprehend the elusiveness, boundless, and dreamy minds that a pisces can offer. And a leo might get fed up with the relax attitude a pisces has. But I do agree with the strong personality. If its too strong the pisces might flee because of the possible burden of mental stress a Leo can produce. Leo's provide rigidity in life which isn't a bad thing. But to a pisces if he's trapped in the Leo's daily grind, it'll get old and fast!<br>  <br>  My good friend is a Leo. Love her to death. Super fun, but can't be around her all the time. I was attracted in friendship not relationship.

CrAwmz65aa	It's in the sonata form.<br>  Don't forget, the sonata is a form, too.<br>  If you need further information, here is a bibliographic database which can help you:<br>  <a href="http://www.lib.utk.edu/music/analysis" rel="nofollow">http://www.lib.utk.edu/music/analysis</a><br>  <br>  If you're writing a paper, be sure to check the spelling on Beethoven's name.|`|AA10125474	Beethoven is the correct spelling.  You could even look it up -- what a novel idea.<br>  <br>  The first movement in sonata-allegro form, (with an introduction)<br>  <br>  The second movement is ternary with varied repetition.<br>  <br>  The last movement is a rondo.<br>  <br>  If you do not understand these terms, research them.<br>  <br>  It is certainly not an oratorio -- is there a chorus with singing?  Nope<br>  <br>  A mass?  Similar to above, nope.  <br>  <br>  Concerto?  Well, a concerto is generally cast with a solo instrument or small group of instruments in dialog with a larger ensemble,like an orchestra.  Since Sonata # 8 is a solo piano work, concerto is an unlikely choice.  However, interestingly enough, concerto's during Beethoven's time were also written in sonata allegro form -- at least one of the movements -- usually the first.  But because there is a solo instrument involved, it employed a special form of the sonata  which contained a double exposition.  Oops -- there's another term for you to research.<br>  <br>  Have fun<br>  <br>  Glinzek

2637c00675fe234e63896e77bdfcccbfaa	The film opens with reporter Angela Vidal (Jennifer Carpenter) and her cameraman Scott Percival (Steve Harris) doing a report on the night shift of a Los Angeles fire station. Angela and Scott are introduced to firefighters Fletcher (Johnathon Schaech) and Jake (Jay Hernandez), whom they will be following for the evening.<br>  <br>  A medical emergency at an apartment complex is reported and the night shift is sent in. Yuri (Rade Serbedzija), the building manager, explains that a woman has been screaming, but is now silent. They are joined by two police officers, James (Andrew Fiscella) and Danny (Columbus Short), in the lobby. They are led to the apartment of Mrs. Espinoza (Jeannie Epper), the source of the screaming. Yuri unlocks the door when she does not answer, and a dog runs out. Within the apartment, Espinoza is struggling to breathe, covered in blood, and foaming at the mouth. She bites James in the neck, severely wounding him, before being subdued by Fletcher. The others take James downstairs to get medical assistance, but find the building sealed shut by the authorities. Fletcher falls from the top floor, bitten, breaking his leg. Lawrence (Greg Germann), a veterinarian, tends to the injured men.<br>  <br>  Danny and Jake go upstairs to subdue Espinoza, where they find the cleaning lady dead in her apartment. Danny shoots Espinoza when she charges at them. They all return to the lobby, meeting Sadie (Dania Ramirez) on the way. By this time, all exterior windows and doors are being sealed, and cell phones are being jammed. Anyone who attempts to leave is forced back at gunpoint. Jake believes they are being quarantined due to a nuclear, biological, or chemical emergency. Danny and Jake round up the tenants and bring them to the lobby, including Elise (Stacy Chbosky), who is displaying the same symptoms as Espinoza.<br>  <br>  While Fletcher, James, and Elise are treated by Lawrence, Angela begins interviewing tenants. One little girl, Briana (Joey King), is sick. Briana claims that she has a dog named Max who was sick and taken to an animal hospital. Lawrence states that the symptoms of those infected are similar to rabies, only much more fast-acting.<br>  <br>  Downstairs, Fletcher shambles into the lobby on his severely broken leg, but Danny injects him with a sedative, while Angela and Scott notice Bernard and Sadie sneaking away, looking for a TV to try to discover what is happening outside. Espinoza's infected dog appears and attacks one of the tenants. They reach Bernard's apartment and turn on the news, where the chief of police claims that everyone has been evacuated from the building, just before the power is shut off. The group is then attacked by Elise, whom Scott kills with his camera.<br>  <br>  Danny rounds everyone up in the textile shop and states that Centers for Disease Control and Prevention agents are coming in to give blood tests. The residents are also told that anyone who is not infected will be released. Lawrence points out that the only way to test for rabies is through a brain sample, not a blood test, but Danny insists on following procedure. After a roll call, Yuri reveals that the penthouse apartment of the building is being rented by a man from Boston who is absent.<br>  <br>  The CDC agents arrive and examine the infected victims, taking a brain sample from Fletcher. Fletcher breaks his restraints and attacks one of the agents. Danny, Jake, and the other agent escape, leaving Lawrence locked in the room with the infected. Lawrence gets infected, the textile shop is locked and the surviving CDC agent is forced to explain the situation: Briana's dog was brought to a vet with an unknown illness and infected all the animals there. The dog was traced back to the apartment building; Briana's fever is then called into question, and she bites her mother before running upstairs. Briana's mother, who is now hysterical, is handcuffed to the stairwell.<br>  <br>  Danny is bitten by Briana, and many of the survivors downstairs are bitten as well. The survivors lock themselves in an upstairs room. The surviving CDC agent has been bitten and runs away to keep from infecting the others. He is locked in an adjacent room while the others try to figure out what to do. Sadie is also bitten but Bernard pleads with the others not to kill her. Bernard cuts through a window seal to call for help, but is killed by a sniper. Yuri reveals that they can escape through a basement passage into the sewers; however, the keys are in his apartment. He is then killed by the infected CDC agent. His wife is then killed by Sadie, who has succumbed to the infection.<br>  <br>  Angela, Scott, and Jake make their way to Yuri's apartment to get his keys, avoiding and killing several infected while doing so. Jake is bitten along the way, and the infected Danny chase Angela and Scott into the penthouse apartment. Within, they find newspapers with articles related to a doomsday cult. They discover that the man from Boston, who was renting the penthouse, was a member of it. O

0z8MwJ3Naa	So far I like it. I am an old timer from the days of the original series and even though it takes a bit of getting used to the new design of the Enterprise I am hopeful. If the information I am about to give you is a spoiler I apologize but the protagonist of the new movie is from Picard's time. His name is Nero and he is Romulan. Apparently 100 years or more after Kirk, the Romulans have discovered a new and very powerful form of lithium crystals. They call it decalithium and it has the energy to blow a star apart. Take that Deathstar!|`|87306bd1a845c348b8dc219cef793f40aa	I am looking forward to the movie as well. I'm sure it will do very well.

But i believe this movie is being made to bridge the time gap between the newest series and the oldest.  Those were the first two in the time line.  I think that if done right and following the information from the latest series the movie could be very good. And im excited as well!!

niZBsn9Qaa	I totally agree with communism as a theory. Everyone has equal of everything. Everyone shares. there are no super rich nor is there poverty. Nobody wants for anything.<br>  <br>  but like i said.....the THEORY is good but put into practice its almost impossible because people by nature are greedy and competitive. You always gotta have the better car, bigger house, better position in the company, more stuff stuff stuff, and unfortunately that makes so many divisions in social status, some people have everything while many people have nothing. and the sad thing is, those people who have everything dont give a crap about the people eating out of garbage cans as long as they have their yacht, 3 summer homes in europe and a mansion on the hill. It sucks and I hate it. YOu cant make everyone agree on a perfect communistic society because of that one trait....<br>  <br>  my husband says im a hippie but i just simply dont agree with the super rich and super poor. Its not fair.|`|t0KTJr8xaa	Communism is bad for the same reason capitalism is bad: humans just can't get past the whole greed thing.<br>  It can't REALLY work because there has to be someone regulating who needs/deserves/gets what, and inevitably, they start to skim off the top, telling themselves they "need" this, "deserve" that due to the stresses of their job.<br>  <br>  Also, communism is as much a social system as an economical one. It promotes classlessness (I only think that's a word) by means of communal ownership: controlled production and property.<br>  You'll get surgery if you need it, and your kids should get fed, but it's easily taken advantage of the way the welfare system in the states is. You can have ten kids, and feed them half of what they've been given by the government, then go out and spend the rest on you.<br>  Plus, it always sucks when you're getting paid the same as someone else when they go at it half-assed and you put in everything, no?<br>  Also, I've heard, but am not sure I believe, that some people who are better at budgeting and maintaining a lifestyle get accused of stealing or something, or that they start being given less, justification being that they need less to live off of. And I repeat that I'm not sure I believe it.<br>  <br>  To me, the Swedish had a pretty good socialist system going for a while. I'm not sure how they do it nowadays.|`|W1GHZW3Caa	taking from the rich and giving to the poor is actually a brilliant idea. Eliminate poverty and get rid of people who don't know what to do with their money. Doesn't work out like that. Quality of products fall.

(community garden everyone worked on and took what they needed)<br>  <br>  I much prefer capitalism. Both communism and socialism violate human nature. Who is going to create the means of production just to be doing it.  They get no more than anyone else.

In both, private enterprise is discouraged, sometimes by force.  The means of production are, in theory at least, owned by the people and used for the benefit of all.  In socialist countries, this generally happened more or less peacefully.  There are democratic socialist countries (such as Sweden) where people basically voted to have socialism be their economic system.<br>  <br>  The first Communist revolution was the Bolshevik Revolution, which turned Russia into the Soviet Union in 1917.  A twist on previous ideas was Vladimir Lenin's idea of the "vanguard of the proletariat" -- the revolutionary cadre of "enlightened" individuals who carry out revolutionary work on behalf of the masses.  In practice, Communist countries have basically combined socialism with authoritarianism, leading to the existence of totalitarian states (such as Cuba and North Korea) where the government (claiming it is acting on behalf of the people) runs everything.  "Totalitarian" is a good description of such a system, since people unfortunate enough to live in such places have the government take, essentially, total control of their lives.<br>  <br>  China is a special case.  Officially Communist, private businesses there are thriving.  Space does not permit an explanation of the paradoxes involves in the PRC's unique system.<br>  <br>  Now, why is it bad?  Simply because it restricts human freedom, which is a good unto itself that trumps nearly any other consideration.  Freedom should cover both the personal and economic realm.  This does not happen in Communist countries.|`|EPki0rwgaa	Communism is like a systematic approach to ensure no-one is earning large sums of money, and therefore are 'common', hence the name Communism. People are not required to work in a Communist society, therefore food supplies and other basic neccesities are often scarce. No Communist nation can economically, socially, and politically advance and excel to that of the Capitalist idyll (United States). We need to look towards a better approach than Capitalism and Communism, so probably Socialism is in turn the ideal form of government, for all nations.|`|2PTlXs9zaa	You never get to achieve anything of your own - like a bird in a cage, you fly when told to fly, live by others ideals and morals for you instead of your own. It may create a classless society, but it is still the puppeteer controlling the strings.<br>  How do you know what my parents told me it was. I'm an adult, not a stupid adult, I know what communism is.|`|GkH5NoFyaa	Because a FEW people control all the wealth and the MAJORITY of the people are kept in poverty.<br>  <br>  A government where few people have wealth and freedom, the rest have poverty and oppression.<br>  <br>  my preferred is the one we have now, with controls over oil that we had in the 1960's. Gas was 35 cents a gallon then.
oauYuhvDaa	I don't know that I "hate" her, but I sure get sick of hearing about her.  What bothers me is that her music isn't really country.  Why is she considered country music?

TKf6z1vHaa	It is a good movie. I didn't read the book, so I wasn't that critical of detail. Although the cinematography was pretty bad with the cameras they used and the lighting. Although they did have some amazing shots and the sound effects for when they were playing baseball in the storm was cool. Now that they have a better director and production company supporting it with great actors and actresses the following movies will be more up to par like harry potter. Although you do have to consider that the books really are not that great, so the storyline will have to be embellished.|`|Plz4T3fzaa	7/10... some people should know where the remaining 3 comes from.<br>  <br>  ...|`|VALxlwYSaa	I thought it was really good. I liked it a lot and they did a great job picking the characters. I do, however, dislike how they skipped a lot. But that's normal in movie's, huh? <br>  <br>  But I also hate how obsessed people are D: I guess I can deal though, right? :P|`|PQ24LYPDaa	If you haven't read the book then it is a 10/10 but if you have read it, it is most likely a 7/10.

The whole blue/green tint thing was kind of dumb though.|`|QmOmbprOaa	CLOUDY NOT ON DVD YET.|`|vCSjs4y0aa	7/10 I thought they missed some good bits though. i didn't like the girl who plays Bella I didn't think she was very good no offence to her or anything. But she didn't seem like Bella. Robert pattinson was good and was exactly like edward. I loved the baseball scene|`|JIy11vWcaa	it was good but the book has more detail and there were some parts that shouldve been in the movie but werent, like the biology class. the movie was about 7/10 for me, the books 9/10|`|Yh7GOkZHaa	Ya it was a great movie, but i didnt like that they missed a lot of parts from the books. it was a 8/10 for me|`|Obdx1IMiaa	ok i loved the movie it was very good but they did skip that chapter i would definitly say 9/10 because im a twilight freak!|`|NcH6Xp8Raa	The movie was a 3/10 for me.

Getting through on the phone lines would definitely be difficult with so many potential callers.  Nickelodeon also runs online sweeps.  <br>  <br>  SweepsAdvantage.com posts all kinds of sweepstakes links, including kids sweeps.

4zscfvvoaa	What you have is a great base to write a song.  I often write little things like this and then put them away until later.  If you are going to try to write songs I have a few suggestions.  Study poetry.  Songs are like an art of poetry.  Then learn to write and store.  Store away your writing for later review.  Editing is the most important part of writing.<br>  <br>  I would take something like this, and review it later for rewrite.  I would rewrite it like:<br>  <br>  He is just another boy,<br>  With your heart he will toy,<br>  He'll turn around, leaving you destroyed,<br>  in loves twisted ploy...<br>  He is just a clueless boy<br>  <br>  Before you even know,<br>  your heart will be captive to cupids bow,<br>  He'll wind up destroying you though,<br>  He is just a clueless boy<br>  <br>  It's another day at the school,<br>  He uses your heart as a tool<br>  leaves wondering like a fool<br>  He is just a clueless boy<br>  <br>  Please watch out for him now<br>  guard your heart somehow<br>  <br>  Well, now I am blanking out.  I would put this away and come back to rewrite it later as well.  This was written taking what you had an expanding on it.  I used a rhyming scheme, which doesn't have to be done.<br>  <br>  If you are not going to rhyme, think rhythm then.<br>  <br>  Just another day at school,<br>  He's just another boy in view,<br>  watch out for him, he plays fools,<br>  breaking  hearts before they knew<br>  <br>  He'll turn around and break your heart,<br>  before you know it, he'll be running out on you,<br>  leaving you with nothing but pain,<br>  He's just a clueless boy, He doesn't know a thing.<br>  <br>  <br>  I don't know if I have been helpful to you here.  What you have is a great few lines, that can be expanded on.  Sometimes songs come from one word.  One word can be drawn out to fill an entire song.  When song writing think about a few things.  You have to accomplish one of two things:  1. tell a story.  Beggining, middle, end  2. grab the listener into a painted portrait.  Created the emotion for the listener.  This is not easy to do.<br>  <br>  Good luck and keep up the good work!!!|`|NScOteNraa	it sounds like a five year old wrote it.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  the problem with peoples lyrics today is theres no real feeling or meaning behind it, theyre just words.|`|ixmaM395aa	It's pretty generic. Just like every other crush song out there.|`|F1Tlda2Maa	...|`|AA11820551	sounds kool<br>  it would be easier to tell if i heard the tune|`|dUeDmb7raa	yea if you like avril lavigne|`|w5ijR1ppaa	yes this sounds like a good song did you write it|`|2N41FbFZaa	its ok lol<br>  it sounds like something taylor swift or miley cyrus would sing<br>   you should finish it =]|`|upNa94CQaa	yeah. its ok.|`|dW3HSba3aa	Great lyrics I like it!!

XqPqKuc1aa	He does have hearing problems that he talked about in an article for Alternative Press magazine in their Taste of Chaos Issue.. it was the second to last one.  He can hear but has problems with them ringing and not hearing clearly.  In the future he will probably go deaf but not soon.  In the article he says the only thing he does to help is smoke weed so he can fall asleep with the ringing.. haha<br>  He should probably be wearing earplugs but he doesnt..|`|QAQHJFI9aa	No, it would be difficult to play music and I've seen interviews of him.

In color!)<br>  <br>  -Charade (spy movie with Audrey Hepburne and Cary Grant, but with enough comedy to make it enjoyable! Color)<br>  <br>  -To Kill a Mockingbird (I know its a book, but its still a good movie with Gregory Peck, excellent courtroom scene. Black and White)<br>  <br>  Aah, there is still so much more! If this is the kind of thing you are looking for, let me know and I'll try to think of some more!|`|ubrYk78waa	One of the best movies ever made was "Every One Comes to Rick's".

07BVJTzvaa	think of what audience your appealing to and what will make them laugh.
vuCo9wZZaa	Any idea which made episode it was or what it was about?
vo6ZenTUaa	HUH?!  I don't get what you are talking about.
WyAGQlAfaa	Stay is one of my favorites, although it might be a little confusing.<br>  <br>  Plot: This movie focuses on the attempts of a psychiatrist to prevent one of his patients from committing suicide while trying to maintain his own grip on reality.<br>  <br>  Blood Diamond is another great one<br>  <br>  Plot: A fisherman, a smuggler, and a syndicate of businessmen match wits over the possession of a priceless diamond.<br>  <br>  I also highly recommend Back to the Future if you haven't seen it yet...<br>  <br>  Plot: In 1985, Doc Brown invents time travel; in 1955, Marty McFly accidentally prevents his parents from meeting, putting his own existence at stake.
vsy4QMHMaa	Let's correct that to be the character of Cio-Cio San is 15 (Act I) and 18 (Acts II and III) years old. and Patricia Racette is 44.<br>  <br>  The reason, of course is that there are no (none whatsoever) 15-18 year old sopranos who could pull off the vocal demands of role. Even the gifted singers at that age are too much of a risk for a large opera house to take on. At the Met (and I suppose other houses) no one even auditions until they are in their mid 20s. Ms. Racette's debut role at the Met was at age 29.<br>  <br>  I agree that it is disconcerting in video (close-ups) to see a mature face and body for the early scenes, but eventually you start to see the role, not the person playing it. In live production, where you could be seated anywhere in the theater, age becomes lost in the distance between the cast and the audience. <br>  <br>  I did see the simulcast yesterday, and was more alarmed by Racette's "wide warble of a vibrato" in the first act than anything to do with her age. Act II and III were totally engaging however.|`|Iu2huVOxaa	Women's voices don't mature until their mid-thirties. so, a very young singer would not be able to sing Cio-Cio San effectively, because the role is written for a mature voice.
kGBmrwyraa	OMG THANK YOU  I LOVE YOUR QUESTION!! Finally some one agrees with me if it was any one else they wouldn't give a Damn!!!|`|U2HVLwr3aa	They're famous so of course it's goina be headline news.<br>  <br>   I don't really know what the question your asking.<br>  <br>  And also this is more of a rant then a question:l.|`|vZDUwF0Naa	i think ur a very sick twisted heartless person|`|31TUT9lpaa	I think its more sad that you're judging Rihanna when we dont have a single clue whats going on. And pretty much everytime i open the newspaper, all i hear about is another girl getting raped, or beat or hurt. The reason Rihanna gets a "free pass to being all mighty and superior" is because they are celeb that everyone knows. Some one in Cali wont care as much if this happened to an unknown person in nebraska. If every single abuse case was reported newpapers would be the size of dictionarys.|`|Z8qBgv8taa	This is a huge problem. People like you who call women stupid for being in a situation they are not in full control of.<br>  We stay or go back because of emotional and mental abuse. After years of that it warps the mind. Something you OBVIOUSLY DO NOT UNDERSTAND!!!! We fear for our children's lives and family's lives. After being brainwashed into believing that if you leave your abuser will find you and kill you your family and children most people who care for others and aren't selfish care about the other people involved and dont want them in harms way. We console them and try to keep a balance until we have the opportunity to improve the situations. THIS is what SURVIVORS do! Don't talk about something you don't know anything about :)<br>  <br>  Oh so tell me since you know everything about DV what do you do when you call the police they come and tell your husband to go for a walk to cool off and we can figure out if we need to take a break from each other to prevent fights. The police leave and of course you get the crap beat out of you for calling the police. Tell me what next? Call them again? You are so unbelievably unaware.<br>  <br>  What do you do when your husband is a police officer and is beating you in the middle of a bus terminal after trying to leave? Scream help a police officer is beating me? Call the police? Ask him to file a report when he's done? Call the FBI? <br>  <br>  What do you do if your husband lives on a reservation and the tribal officers refuse to help? If you leave he will automatically get your kids! GROW UP and LEARN something. Not every situation is so simple, these are only a few situations of women i've worked with. You need to take a long look in the mirror. You shouldn't be judging people this way.

If one of those don't win, then... hmm... Alexis Grace.|`|QsbB6vkoaa	i want allison to win.<br>  did you know that she already won in one tv show that she was in?<br>  i don't know why she didn't get famous then, but i'm pretty sure she's going to win this season.|`|SMrG7A9laa	I really really love Allison and Danny. They are both great singers! If one of them don't win, I feel Scott or Adam should win. Scott is a great singer and he is really inspirational. Adam is a cool dude with a rocker voice.
Hjsy8rnRaa	Felicia Barton - She was phenomenal! Her "No One" was good<br>  <br>  Mishavonna Henson - She can definitely sing.<br>  <br>  Arianna Afsar - Her vocal ability is impressive<br>  <br>  Tatiana del Toro - She had the voice and she made the show interesting to watch<br>  <br>  Stevie Wright - She has a wide vocal range for a young girl like her.|`|LkTcLWTOaa	felicia barton - her rendition of no-one was excellent....|`|JepeaPHsaa	Felicia Barton and Kendall Beard.

Looks fade over time and if looks is all you got now eventually you'll have nothing.|`|5IsOgX8jaa	..?? Duh!<br>  <br>  If all someone has is good looks and no brains, they should be completely and utterly destroyed.|`|uzUXB0WCaa	It depends how good looking you are...|`|uPwyLImUaa	yes there is. If you think there is nothing more to life than being ridiculously good looking, then you live a very shallow life. Think about Oprah, she might not be ugly, but no offence to her but she is not "ridiculously good looking".

And maybe a disco ball or something. Then just talk and laugh at dance, my friend did something like this at his party and it was HEAPS of fun!<br>  <br>  Another idea is go to a beach? If u live near one that is. That's always fun :)|`|pnZTQPRNaa	everyone go to a good spa all day and get everything they have that you want - i know it would be expensive so just bring like 2 of youre best friends.this will only really work if youre a girl.|`|suGp0Slqaa	horse back riding<br>  arcade(kinda childish but really fun)<br>  paint ball<br>  ice skating<br>  roller blading<br>  laser tag<br>  sleepover at a hotel for 1 night in a suite with a pool and all<br>  go carts r really cool

AA10125474	I find his Ballade in f minor an amazing work.  The opening sounds for all the world like a story teller's preamble to his tale.  The way he weaves all the themes together is remarkable and manages to make it all unfold like a narrative just blows my mind.  Each theme is a character in a epic.  <br>  <br>  Wow.<br>  <br>  Glinzek|`|8966788df07da7406962e8509333231baa	WOW, what a coincidence, I just discovered that piece for myself, and was in complete awe when I heard it. Needless to say, it became a keeper.<br>  I also really love Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 23 in A major, k488 adagio, and the Cello Concert in E. Op 85, adagio-moderato.|`|wig9WKPwaa	A bit overplayed, but wonderful nonethless.<br>  <br>  Listen to Liszt's Un Sospiro.|`|qWNdhGVXaa	Chopin is always amazing.<br>  I personally love the second movement of Mozart's 3rd concerto. ( for violin)|`|PS0oSoXFaa	Used to be one of my favorites, not anymore, but it's still a great piece. Actually, it reminds a lot of Rachminoff's Prelude Op. 23 No. 1 in F# minor. It's not as dramatic as a lot of Rachmaninoff; it's simpler, dark and eerie like the Chopin.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEDFavmrdaI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEDFavmrd...</a>

ZzqWzFNiaa	Ahhh Pavement. It makes me feel good whenever I see a question with that name in it. Brightens my day every time.<br>  <br>  Personally, I love them all (although I do have to be in the right mood to choose Westing out of all the options, great record though). I am definitely in the minority though in my choice of Terror Twilite. I see why it isn't a popular choice. It's largely seen as the Malkmus and Godrich show, but I just happen to dig the Malkmus and Godrich show quite a bit. It just recently passed Wowee Zowee in my good graces. I just love where they took it with Terror Twilite.<br>  <br>  I love S&E and Brighten the Corners. As far as Pavement records go, I'm not a HUGE Crooked Rain guy, but it's still a wonderful album. It just feels to me like it doesn't have quite the same amount of Pavement magic on it, though there is still plenty (I think I'm most likely in the minority on that one as well). The way I see it though, my fifth favorite Pavement record, better than most records.<br>  <br>  My favorite band for about 12 years now.<br>  <br>  ******************<br>  Thanks Wire. That made me happy.<br>  <br>  Sorry I droned on, but no one ever asks Pavement questions and I need to store up for the coming winter, or I guess spit out. Not a great metaphor.<br>  <br>  **************<br>  Hi Radio.<br>  I can see what you mean about the Jicks identity really feeling like it's taking. I really loved Real Emotional Trash, and even though for me it kind of happened at Pig Lib (the first record you have told me it was a Pavement record, and that they were taking a step back towards the formula after Terror Twilite and it would have made sense to me, though I'd feel a little bad for Scott), then sort of unhappened at Face the Truth (which particularly at parts felt awfully like Pavement +5 or 6 years), I think they really cemented something with RET. I think I might still like Face the Truth a fraction more, but you're totally right about Jicks really feeling like a true... oh what's the word... oh well, a solid unit standing on its own.|`|DnWsMhwLaa	hmmm... crooked rain, crooked rain... i dont think they did a bad album though... wowie zowie is another favorite...<br>  <br>  i better star so prof anger can tell us a thing or two about pavement|`|RVAPQg6Waa	Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain|`|0cc7b69ea6b5f359aa006de2a67d9086aa	I diggin "Brighten The Corners", for now...|`|yjSGVfdiaa	Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks really came into their own on Emotional Trash last year.  I don't know whether that's more them or my willingness to listen to them as something other than an extension of Pavement and appreciate them as their own thing.  I think the addition of Sleater-Kinney drummer, Janet Weiss actually really does help though - she's very talented, always loved her stuff with S-K.<br>  <br>  Anyway, not what you asked.<br>  <br>  My favorite Pavement album has changed thanks to the Matador Rereleases.  I love the re-release of Wowie Zowie.  There are so many ideas coming at you on that record that I think that it was really hampered by that sort of styling in its original release, but I think, when spread over the two discs, with the bonus tracks, and some of the early versions of the Brighten the Corners stuff (another album really helped by the bonus materials), it's just a really stellar effort from a great band.  One of my favorites.
4HhYhxwjaa	Lol yeah|`|EdBvqVuLaa	NO, y should I when all I can do is get up for like 2 minutes and go wash the laundry. Seriously, it's also kinda a waste of money.|`|AB5erhhUaa	Lol no why would I waste money, I would just wear them until the color went from white to yellow or brown. Why wash?|`|lVIKtbMoaa	OMG.

Don't ever make me do that again please. <br>  <br>  <br>  Maroon 5 Fall Out Boy *grabs scissors* and charges at list. <br>  <br>  <br>  All of the other bands deserve to be part of that list.  They have shown and proved themselves worthy.  Including two of my favorites Vampire Weekend and Brand New.  It's an insult how Maroon 5 and Fall Out Boy *gags* made it that high up.|`|ssoZ33XIaa	The Beatles, even though I love The Who as well.<br>  <br>  BA: Fall Out Boy and Maroon 5 are on the list why?  The only band I particularly like out of the others is Brand New, but I can't agree with a list that labels Fall Out Boy and Maroon 5 as the best of the decade.|`|48df0ea585c1658be36a46553408d993aa	The Who is in heavier rotation for me, but seriously.... impossible choice.<br>  <br>  Not familiar enough with the groups on the list to know...

I mean where are Radiohead, Queens Of The Stone Age, Arctic Monkeys, Kings Of Leon and White Stripes? Why the hell is Maroon 5 and Fall Out Boy even on the list? lol.<br>  <br>  Well at least the Strokes are included, that's something I guess.|`|Cc9C7Bd1aa	ARGH, this is impossible, on account of they are both my favourite bands of all time. However if I HAD to choose between them I suppose I would say the Beatles...i guess. garumph.|`|yQH4Fpoiaa	BQ: I agree with about half of the list... the ordering is horrible, too. (Fall Out Boy? SERIOUSLY?)<br>  <br>  The Beatles<br>  <br>  Vampire Weekend, The Strokes, Decemberists, Mars Volta are all good imo. Wolfmother is okay.|`|fx3gIRh2aa	I think The Beatles are a better band, but I happen to enjoy listening to the music of The Who more.|`|Catsy82Caa	i switch them off every couple days. tough choice, no?<br>  <br>  bq: honestly the mars volta is the only good group on that list|`|LJJ38fVKaa	THE BEATLES!!<br>  <br>  Bq: I agree with half of the list... I mean... WHO THE F*CK IS FALL OUT BOY?!?!?|`|UFE7BJHBaa	which band did Twist & Shout better ?|`|0BoDF6iBaa	The Beatles.  All the songs just had magic.<br>  <br>  BQ: Arcade Fire are most definitely worth listening too if you haven't yet.

Peyton's real brother shows up in a few more episodes (he's in the military and he's black). Peyton and the real Derek are related by their father. They have different moms. Elli is Peyton's BIRTH mom. Peyton was adopted (her adopted mom died when she was little and her adopted dad is off on a boat.)|`|MNuS31nsaa	its season 4.<br>  I LOVE OTH!!!|`|JR3UxWYEaa	The Derek youre seeing is a stalker who is stalking Peyton because she reminds him of his ex girlfriend who was killed in a car crash in the car that he was driving.<br>  Peyton realises hes not who she thought he was when she reads her IM and sees the way he writes you (yyou) just like the person that was sending her weird IMs does.<br>  Her real brother saves her the night she realises and the bad guy is pushed out her window lying on her lawn.... but when the poilice come he's gone<br>  <br>  <br>  Her real brother teaches her how to defend herself and shows her how to punch.<br>  Bad derek comes back on Prom Night and locks her and brooke up in her basement and it gets REALLY creepy, peyton escapes then brooke does and they kick ***!:)<br>  <br>  Eventually they visit him in prison and realise that peyton reminded him of his ex!<br>  <br>  What can I say Im as addicted to OTH as you!!|`|152b3a8ec4e56ae376c7fcca43292d4daa	season 4 peyton finds out she has a brother named derek. then she meets this guy claming to be her brother turns out he's just a stalker(phyco derek) whose real name is ian. anyway peyton's real brother, who is half black shows up to help save her from phyco derek.<br>  <br>  peyton and derek have the same dad. in season 6 peyton meets her and derek's real father mick wolf.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyton_Sawyer#Season_4" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyton_Sawy...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyton_Sawyer#Season_6" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyton_Sawy...</a>|`|VvBm28Zgaa	It's season 4. peyton's mother is elli and she does have a brother named derek but that's not the real derek seen in this episode u will however see him in later episodes.

I'd never heard this word before, even though I'm an avid reader!  I don't know if the fear is rooted in not knowing how to pronounce the word or not, but there's different techniques you can use to help overcome it:<br>  <br>  **You can take deep breaths to calm yourself.<br>  **Close your eyes & imagine yourself in a place that is soothing to you.<br>  **Try to break the word down by syllables & then piece it back together (to help make it easier to pronounce).<br>  **Use a dictionary (paper or online) to look up the meaning of the word so that you understand it - a lot of times, fear is caused by the unknown.<br>  **If the fear becomes overwhelming, consult a therapist that specializes in phobias.|`|6ik7OJRNaa	.... i start drawing bicycles and then I throw the sketches to fire.....<br>  <br>  I suffer oneandahalfpedalophobia - it is almost the same with yours!|`|IizPFrELaa	Abbreviate|`|HGnWKRzyaa	Use simplified words...|`|3ee64ee7ec766828c5143beacd3dc7f6aa	Rather than avoiding the objects of your phobia, confront them head on.

Bands like Pearl Jam, Alice In Chains, Soundgarden etc.<br>  <br>  Then there's the many supergroups, like Audioslave, Mad Season, Temple Of The Dog etc.<br>  <br>  Finally, because of either the emphasis on classic rock (Led Zeppelin, The Beatles etc.) or 'new' rock (Kings Of Leon, Coldplay etc.), a lot of bands in between don't get mentioned often.

No one is a 'loser.' If she starts getting on your nerves, tell her that she is annoying you and to stop. <br>  You know, one of the nicest things you can do for someone is include them. I think you need to get off of your high horse- She may be annoying but she is not a loser.|`|EcIwl0tDaa	Tell your friend that you and that girl don't get along.

oFv3v9Oeaa	Ahhh, the ultimate Co-dependent & obsessive/compulsive relationship...the Roadrunner and the Coyote. <br>  <br>  The late, great Chuck Jones, the SUPER-genius behind creating that character, was actually a very humble and somewhat insecure man. He said in interviews that the characters he most related to were not Bugs or Pepe LePew, but instead Daffy Duck and Wile E. Coyote, since they were always trying their hardest but never quite succeeding - which is how he felt about himself. <br>  <br>  Oh...and don't we ALL love it when we can make things go Boom...or whichever sound is made during and "explosion"?  ;-)|`|JWSCTek3aa	I always cheer for Wile E<br>  I wish he'd just catch that lil bastid and EAT him already !|`|AA10269742	sure|`|YP2xuZdtaa	no|`|786cdd812ce5aab02a737d9a44746cdbaa	Wile E.

QhlEOI6iaa	Her emotions run deep, but she doesn't let them get in the way of her own pride. She keeps her head up high regardless of what anyone else thinks of her or her family. I do agree that she's most likely a water sign but not Pisces. She seems more stubborn to me then any Pisces that I know, I'd guess that she's a Scorpio.<br>  <br>  Edit: Yes, I agree about Darcy! He is definitely a Scorpio rising, and I'd think he has some serious Pluto-Mars aspect. And talking about Jealous!|`|8326e8ed18368243be0734a4088435e3aa	With that social wit and quick razor sharp tongue, Elizabeth is a Sagittarius, Gemini rising possibly a Scorpio or Virgo moon/jupiter/mars giving her some major discerning.

caOfuKl5aa	This joke's origin is unknown but the first known documented usage is from the movie "Wayne's World." In the scene Garth is holding a large picture of Claudia Schiffer. Garth tells Wayne, "Are you through yet? I'm getting tired of holding this." Wayne responds, "Yeah, that's what she said." The phrase is also used quite often by the character Michael Scott on the U.S. version of the TV show The Office.|`|yFKgbkWCaa	That phrase did not originate from The Office but it is a running joke on the show.<br>  <br>  It's not known where the phrase actually comes from but one of the first uses was in "Wayne's World".|`|Q9BDX5Zgaa	I would argue that it didn't originate with Wayne's World.<br>  <br>  It didn't originate... anywhere traceable, really.<br>  <br>  I mean, it's just a joke people say that's always been around. Who invented the knock-knock joke? Who did the first "your mama" joke.|`|eK4ZeR6Yaa	They say it all the time on The Office, not in just one episode, it is an ongoing joke on the show.

LrKCLZF7aa	No. Neither the Sun or the moon are sexual planets. I have seen aspects that may do this and have been true in about 12 case studies of homosexual and bisexual people. The planets that were active in these cases were comprised of Neptune or Uranus with a sexual planet. Please keep in mind that NOT everyone with these aspects are gay or bisexual. <br>  <br>  The sexual planets that I have seen work with these combinations are Mars and Venus. And although Venus is not a confirmed case it does show these tendencies. I have seen these aspects in enhancements as well as clashes. If a person has more than one there is a much higher chance that they are gay. For example Neptune Quincunx Mars and Uranus quincunx Mars and Neptune sextile Uranus thus creating a Yod with focus on Mars. I've also seen it work with Juno. So far there have not been any exceptions to these rules. I tried to conduct a study on the astrological aspects of gay people only to get the question removed. I did get about 10 valid charts out of it though.<br>  <br>  As far as I know there is no gay aspect and this would hold true for androgyny as well.

4SV4bz69aa	thats kinda wierd..cuz ppl will see him as sam in the first movie and then a new random guy in the second..? that looks bad for the producers. they should always be certain about actors/actresses in the movie and the actors/actresses should be certain about staying even though its a series.<br>  why is he leaving anyway?|`|1wNsBNmxaa	nope not at all they come in they go maybe he had another gig to go to <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  смерть???|`|YGMlocIVaa	omg<br>  i didn't know he wasn't going to be in new moon, that's sad =(<br>  but the good thing is that he didn't appear that much in the first movie and i forgot how he looks like..<br>  <br>  =)

Here's a list I found which I think is pretty accurate. <br>  <br>  Good Morning Baltimore from Hairspray<br>  On My Own from Les Miserables<br>  Adelaide's Lament from Guys and Dolls (why are teenagers always singing this? the character has been engaged for 14 years!)<br>  Memory from Cats<br>  I Hate Men from Kiss Me Kate<br>  All That Jazz from Chicago<br>  Wash That Man... from South Pacific<br>  Can't Help Lovin'... from Show Boat<br>  Big Spender from Sweet Charity<br>  You Can Always... from City of Angels<br>  Shy from Once Upon a Mattress<br>  Tomorrow from Annie<br>  I Enjoy Being A Girl from Flower Drum Song<br>  Broadway Baby, Hard Hearted Hannah, Hit Me With a Hot Note from Follies<br>  Surrey With The Fringe On Top & I Can't Say No from Oklahoma<br>  They Call the Wind Mariah from Paint Your Wagon<br>  Corner of the Sky from Pippin<br>  Summertime from Porgy & Bess<br>  The Music of the Night from The Phantom of the Opera<br>  Hero & Let's Hear It For The Boy from Footloose<br>  Seasons of Love from Rent<br>  Big Spender from Sweet Charity<br>  Part Of Your World from The Little Mermaid<br>  In My Own Little Corner from Cinderella<br>  Popular from Wicked<br>  Anthem from Chess<br>  This Is The Moment from Jekyll & Hyde<br>  <br>  These I guess are classic songs and are WAY too over done.

WAkptWfpaa	yes i love her and i adored her on AMC and even as the mean spiteful little chloe|`|552a230b78bc5b4160481e32addc49e6aa	Ashley in real life is 50, but I think they make her character younger on the show.  I really think she's beautiful. Lauren too for her age.  Chloe has really beautiful brown eyes, and smile, but I can't get past all her deception.  I think she's trying to change though..|`|30r4coInaa	Very pretty, very good actress.  She's done a great job of making the viewer sympathetic towards a character that was once universally hated.|`|d882696e589804c1748f12db3ec0ba36aa	I think Chloe is very pretty but not the prettiest. Victoria, Colleen, Lily, Heather and Jana are beautiful and IMO more prettier then her.|`|r7sgshwKaa	Negative. I think it is NIcky. She's beautiful and also has an aura about her that's almost regal. I wish I had that thick horse mane she has. Her hair is beautiful.|`|BwHoLEHvaa	Chloe is a pretty girl, but HOT??!!  I don't think so, there's many actresses that are much hotter than her!|`|xUUkIzU9aa	I don't think she is hot, or pretty, I think <br>  sharon <br>  heather <br>  and Nicki are better looking.|`|I0JBGllLaa	It's all about sexy Amber!|`|fa4c831f08b161bce2611f5ba6f16824aa	very pretty|`|EPPb5pRBaa	She is ok.|`|uUzbqGh5aa	Yeah, she's a hot mess alright!|`|f9crUDTwaa	Everyone has their own taste .|`|GomZ9oYHaa	Yeah hotter than a 2 dollar bill.|`|tEqcmCv3aa	Ummm..NO!

I am liking her character more than I used to though. I just wish she wasn't doing that to Billy. He needs to take care of his baby but she shouldn't make him take her too or not get to see his baby.|`|29def525b4de3e4f1e95aaabfaa25f77aa	Not in my opinion. The character is annoying. She's cute but not the prettiest. Lily, Tyra, Victoria and Heather are "hotter" than Chloe.|`|ow1m3c8jaa	She is pretty alright and a good actress to make us all hate her so much when she first came on Y&R, but even though I am starting to really like Chloe, I wouldn't say she's the hottest IMO anyway.|`|d1AuDRoFaa	I'm biased because i LOVE Elizabeth Hendrickson.<br>  <br>  but shes better as Maggie on AMC<br>  <br>  and yeah, shes hot.|`|5f0111f71db8592710a5d1cb4897be4aaa	Yes,,,for a CrAZy she is cute !!!

ab250551cde4aadbf54a0fea8a7b14e1aa	Sekai meisaku d?wa: Hakuchou no ouji (The Wild Swans) (Spider's Web) (The Prince of the Swans) 1977<br>  There are different versions of the same story. The Russian cartoon is based on Hans Christian Andersen's "The Wild Swans" which features 11 brothers, a sister called Eliza and a villainous Archbishop. Andersen is credited as the author but he actually modified an older folk-tale which was part of the Grimm collection and has many variants worldwide. The original story featured 6 brothers and no Archbishop but a villainous mother-in-law who stole the heroine's children. <br>  The basic plot is:  A young girl must spend six years making sweatshirts out of poison ivy in order to save her six brothers which have been turned into swans by an evil sorceress.

I was also asking about the other people because I was interested in what they had to say. <br>  <br>  As for your question, our external selves are our rising sun. That is why some people are hard to get to know or may seem different than their true inner self. <br>  <br>  As for me, not really.

Honesty, I could care less about what people think of me. Because the ones that think negative are usually the ones that have issues themselves. No i do not judge a book by its cover.

bc7f2eca272c247b1b16daabe29dff21aa	yea me and my friend bought tickets to a movie once but when we walked  in the theater we decided to watch another movie but we didnt want to buy 2 more tickets so we snuck into a movie<br>  but it was completley empty and they showd the movie still|`|iIiRVexbaa	Once, my wife and I went to see a movie in the middle of a weekday.  We approached the ticket window and found no one selling tickets.  We went inside the theater and didn't see a soul, not even at the concession stand.  All of the lights were on, the video games were beeping, and music was playing.  It felt like a horror movie where people simply disappear.  We ventured further and found the movie in which we were interested.  We were the only people in the theater.  We sat down and laughed about the situation.  The movie started as scheduled.  We watched the movie and left the theater without seeing another person.  <br>  <br>  My point:<br>  Yes, movies play if no one buys a ticket :)|`|8qYvC8Qxaa	yes. its automatic|`|xNhNRJrBaa	nope there is no point so why would they and that probely would never happen anyway :)|`|Q5rX0jjoaa	im sure|`|q8ZEWy7Xaa	yea|`|EdBvqVuLaa	probably not cause they won't be making any business and they use up electricity still for nothing.|`|kAtgdJVkaa	I think the movie is like a scheduled time to play...so they probably do.|`|50UbJp14aa	i think the cancel it, or arrange it for another day|`|OCHhJWpHaa	i guess|`|0hxK0khKaa	Not sure, since I've never worked at a movie theater.|`|V5K66Xb4aa	depends on the theatre. if its an overall slow day, they pick a movie to play and the staff watch it.|`|5e6S1JqWaa	yes.|`|QsbB6vkoaa	yes they do.|`|AA11198190	l guess so...<br>  last week my friend and l went to see a movie and we were the only two people in the cinema.<br>  So lf it were completely empty at the start...they have to consider...late comers.|`|rcx668lgaa	Only the first 15 minutes.

p44PJVJ7aa	I LOVE Keane they are my favorite band in the entire world!!! ( I discovered them last year on One Tree Hill (Episode 2x2) when Everybody's Changing played and I got hooked...) I have been listening to them ever since then. Their music is incredible, beautiful lyrics, awesome melody. In short, they can make you close your eyes and do nothing else but just listen. It's a wow and like you, I wonder why they are not more famous than they are. Maybe because their interests do not lie in being bad boys and hogging the spotlight. Another one of their qualities.<br>  To show you the extent of my appreciation of them, I'll tell you one of my secrets. In my bed, my three favorite pillows have names-- Richard, Tim and Tom-- and I often hug them and pretend they are the real thing (especially Rich-- hes the cutest). It's embarassing but true!<br>  So that's about it for now (don't want to drag on and on) but do you know where I could contact them? Like send a letter or something? I'm no stalker, I just want to know. Thanks!<br>  Keane on!<br>  PS Where do you think I got my Yahoo Answers name from?

4sicG1wqaa	They just make digital copies of the best, usually first-generation, copy of a work available.  Once digitized, they stretch and crop the new version to fit the new display format.<br>  <br>  Another advantage of digitizing "originals" is there is no degradation of quality in successive generations; that is, a copy of a copy of a copy is as good as the "original."

EuwjIJ3Zaa	What exactly a Saturn Return IS...It takes Saturn about 27-29 years to make a completion around the Zodiac. Once Saturn makes it's way around the Zodiac through it's orbit, it ends up back to your Natal position, at the time you were born.  So, for example, my Saturn in my birth chart is at 26 degrees Sagittarrius...in roughly 29 years from my date of birth, it is expected that Saturn will again be at 26 degrees Sagittarrius.  Basically, Saturn returns to it's original point where it is placed on your birthchart.<br>  <br>  It's kind of symbolic to growing up. The Saturn return is right before we turn the big 3-0. Saturn represents lessons and barriers, ect., and getting through the Saturn return, it's symbolically setting aside our old childish ways, and really vamping up our life styles.  We become an adult...it's seen as something like a right-of-passage astrologically speaking. <br>  <br>  The Saturn return, in it's full affect, will typically last about a year or so.  The year before, and the year after is makes it's exact conjunction, will probably stick out in your life, either because you got a lot of work done, or you had a lot of inconvenient experiences, in regards to material wealth, or marriages, ect.<br>  <br>  If you want to know when it will happen, just look at the current placements Saturn is in right now.  Saturn is currently at about 18 degrees Virgo. In about 7 years it will be in Sagittarrius.  You can purchas an astrological ephemeris, to accurately guage when the conjunction will be happening. <br>  <br>  If you want to know exactly where this will manifest in your life, look at the house that your natal Saturn is positioned in.  If it's in the 4th house, you may find complications in your home, or the 10th, you may really put forth a lot of effort for your career.  Also, take into consideration the aspects. If you Venus squares your Saturn natally, you may have some break-ups, or financial problems...Mars/Saturn contacts natally, may give you bad health, or you may find an emphasis (good or bad) about getting work done., ect.<br>  <br>  Saturn is not more difficult for a man or a woman.  It just depends on the person, and how well they or have not structured their life up to that point.|`|LJY29QCOaa	it varies a little because the orbit of saturn varies a little, so you'd have to have your chart done to know. You can get your chart at astro.com and compare your natal saturn to the current position of saturn; when the two of them are at the same zodiac degree then saturn has "returned" to its natal position, and has completed the circle so to speak.<br>  Saturn returns aren't particularly easy for anyone, but if you're rational about it, it isn't necessarily so bad; you're not a kid anymore and can do a lot of things that kids can't......<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.astro.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.astro.com/</a>|`|7rrNvFK7aa	Saturn returns is around 28 1/2 yrs , for men and for women. It lasts 2  1/2 years in each sign approximately. It is just as difficult especially if Moon squares or opposes Saturn in a women's chart.<br>  <br>  libra|`|Ow3O7h4caa	Saturn’s work is to solidifying, concreting and tending to make the affairs of life more stable and secure; hence if the native is not ready for these conditions it disturbs and unsettles the mind, causing resentment at the conditions which it imposes.<br>  Irrelevant what skin, sex, colour etc...Saturn touches everybody.<br>  <br>  Saturn return is the most important time in your life. A major cycle is closing and great changes are about to take place. How gret these changes depends largely on what you have been doing with your life over the past several years. Hve you ben living as you feel you should or as you think others want you to? If you have been doing the latter, Saturn will have a greater impact.<br>  <br>  The first transit of Saturn occurs arond 29 yrs and the second, around 58 yrs old. All I can tell you is that , in the year before this transit, many aspects of your life have begun to change. Relationshsips have changed  or ended and youmay have changed your residence or your job etc...<br>  Whatever Return you are facing, you will feel that s substantial portion of your life has passed and that you had better get on with making it all your. Whether consciously or not, you are prunning your life of everything tht is not relevant to what you really are as a human being. <br>  <br>  Do not dwell on any losses for they are necessary in order to clear the decks for the major period of action in your life. If this is your first return, which I imagine is, you should roll with the punch and voluntarily let go of these elements. if you try to hold on, you may be somewhat successful, but when Saturn returns the second time, it will be much more difficult. Then you will be firmly established on paths tuat are inappropriate for you. <br>  <br>  This is a time of endings and new beginnings. if you have built your life up to now around activities that are inappropriate for you. it will be a period of crisis. If you have benn doing what tou should in previous years, this transit will simply mark a time of solidification as i mentioned earlier and the beginning of new phases of activity. It is this transit that makes people over 30 diffeent from those under 30 yrs old because Saturn return is one of the most maturing of all transits.<br>  <br>  Good Luck !!!|`|32P3hG0Laa	Some additional info: A Saturn Return is time to take stock and grow up. This is when you examine your life and look at what works and what doesn't... and it's time to trash what doesn't work, and focus on what does..<br>  <br>  Now where did you get the odd idea that it is more difficult for women?

654c7643984cd6b3f7f0f00356056e81aa	I DO NOT generalize music in that way....and can identify music I adore and abhor in every genre of music that exists!  I even listen to some music of the Aboriginal tribes of Australia!<br>  <br>  It really grates on my nerves to hear people say they hate "such & such" type of music....my sister always claimed she hated classical music, but whenever she'd be at my house and Vivaldi would be playing in the background, she's comment on how pretty the music was....I let her listen to it many times, and only told her it was an artist named Antonio Vivaldi before I ever let on it was considered "classical music"....<br>  <br>  I am changing minds...one rube at a time!|`|2FIbamFgaa	I do that yes.<br>  <br>  <br>  No I'm just kidding, but if I'm told it's *insert genre* then I won't be expecting anything great.

2b5799147194d19d72182c8e2216fa41aa	I tried to make a graph to help explain this, you used the term " due east " and I think you should have used the term " due north " to describe the way back. Due north is exactly north from where you are, it is where the compass points. I hope this little illustration helps. I posted the cardinal dirtections North, south, east and west. NP= north pole, C= campsite,  *= the walk south, >= the walk east, and \ = the walk north, the " x " doesn't mean anything, had to use them as a filler because when I posted this, they wanted to bunch it all together. Do you see on the trip " due north " it cut's across in a triangle ?  That is because the person is so far north, that due north brings them back to their camp. The Earth is a sphere, and the closer we get to it's poles the smaller it is in circumference, so even though we are used to seeing the cardinal directions like I have them below, where north, south, east, and west are laid out like below, if you have ever held a compass you notice how it rotates. It rotates in relation to where you are, it points north, and the rest of the directions are all in relation to that. So the person walks south, then east, and then due north which points the way back where they started because of their relation to the north pole. <br>  <br>  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxN<br>  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxWx+xE                                       <br>  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxS                                        <br>                                         <br>               NP                         <br>  <br>               C<br>                *\<br>                *x \<br>                *xx \<br>                *xxx \<br>                *>>>>>   <br>  <br>  I hope this helps clarify this some.<br>   ~ andrew|`|IUlIixJLaa	This doesn't make sense to me, but I am not that bright!!!!!!!!!!!|`|Vp3FklU2aa	When you travel northern it gets colder so your going to the north pole so she must've seen a polar bear|`|MoUtk7cUaa	she was at the north pole so any direction she went was south, then any 90 deg turn was going to not take any further from camp, and another 90 deg turn she's facing the north pole again. do the travel on a globe w/ yer finger if your still confused, starting at the pole.|`|yGp37iQWaa	you are at the north pole so any direction is south<br>  then to the right is east, turn right and you'll be heading for you campsite|`|rEWZWZi5aa	the riddle is told wrong|`|v6x8EXSxaa	Well, the only thing I can think of is it would be a polar bear because if it was any other kind of bear you wouldn't see it 5 miles away because of the trees. Polar bears reside on the tundra, no trees or obsticles to block view. You can see for miles.|`|foRxnhHvaa	she was to be at one of the poles. if u draw it u can see that it would not work if not at one of the poles. but if she is at the poles then she will always return to the were she started. hope i helped.|`|vyXvOaUvaa	She was at the north pole where the meridians will have that effect, hence the polar bear but that is unlikely as there is rarely open ice there.|`|6ri7AYC1aa	She pitched her tent in the North pole.

Real  people just don't believe that people who wish to be exploited in such ways should be given props. <br>  <br>  However, on the hip-hop tip he is not a bad rapper but he just gets famous for crap songs. Personally, I think he has style and he can be a sick lyricist. But their better hip-hop out there than LiL Wayne and it's sad none of that gets the attention Lil Wayne gets.|`|kuxVB76maa	Like I said, They "hate" Lil Wayne, Soulja Boy, 50 Cent and Flo Rida because they all jealous that they're on the radio, mtv and winnin awards. Dissin Lil Weezy makes Yahoo! Answer users feel better.|`|6c7e9e289fd5db36cd934c29dca6003eaa	People love to try to bring him down.  He doesn't even care though so the jokes on them.|`|JazMdYHFaa	who cares wat ppl say bout lil wayne hes the best rapper he nos it so no1 can put him down|`|nZl3aATaaa	People including the real artists of the industry (old school artists) hate lil wayne not because he's successful, but because he's a fraud. Whens the last time you heard someone say "i hate eminem" or "i hate tupac" "i hate biggie" when? <br>  <br>  We hate lil wayne because he's a complete sell out and a fake. He's a proven fake blood, he makes no sense when he raps and he only does it to make a quick buck regardless of how he's killing the hip hop genre (just like soulja boy). So when you think "why are you hatin on his success" drop the thought and remind yourself that your listening to a lieing, snitching, sell out thats killing a good thing.|`|bpe8XVWDaa	People have their opinions<br>  <br>  And some people like to waste their time and hate on him.<br>  <br>  I don't like him, but I don't go around saying "I hate Lil' Wayne"<br>  <br>  But I think people hate on him so much because he's a "Hate-able" person..If that makes sense.|`|lMOXHh45aa	I guess you want his hate too huh, is that why you always post questions about him??? you can't be wayne... wayne doesnt like men, where do you even get the audacity to keep mentioning somebody on his level???|`|jL8K9dMPaa	I don't know.

AA11879371	I love staring at the moon, too!  I grew up on a farm in Nebraska and all of us kids used to lay out on the lawn and sky gaze.  The full moon was gorgeous.  In the fall the full Harvest moon would rise blood red and fade to a beautiful shade of orange.  When it was on the horizon it looked huge!<br>  <br>  We would have blankets and pillows out there and fall asleep under the full moon.<br>  <br>  Then years later, there were people walking on the moon!  Wow! does that bring back memories.<br>  <br>  Moved to California and things changed, too busy working and living to watch the moon.<br>  <br>  Moved back to Nebraska and moon watching is back in my life.  Yes, I still love staring at the moon.  Enjoy, and know there is always someone somewhere staring contentedly at the moon.|`|uzXwM0Qzaa	Moons are creepy!|`|AA11905223	I do that occasionally myself, including the mp3 player.

I never see the moon!!|`|vMv5jRg3aa	I like just the look of all the stars, it's best when I get out of town and look at the sky on the night of a new moon, so that I can see starts, so that the sky appears blanketed in white.<br>  Though some people find it relaxing just to see the moon, and some people just never tried it and by the time they are old enough to type well on the computer to answer your question they might be too old to try to change, or want to change.|`|foRxnhHvaa	that is one of my favorite things to do.

eeKlogL4aa	The Jonas Brothers are a bubblegum pop band (their music is so sugary-sweet it gave front-woman Nick Jonas diabetes) from Disney who brainwash 5-15 year old girls with their "music" and "looks". They don't appeal to anyone over 15 years old (if they do, then that person has serious issues). Their music is all slushy love songs (that of course they do not write themselves) that make 12 year old girls think that they are going to marry a Jonas Brother. They are extremely gay, and sing like constipated cats having sex. You are lucky you have not heard of these torturous boys.

akUVg7CEaa	Your question has different answers, depending on what you are actually asking.<br>  <br>  Are you asking, which blues musician played in England first?<br>  <br>  According to wikipedia;  "Muddy Waters is said to have been the first electric blues player to have performed in front of British audiences circa 1959, and others like Sonny Boy Williamson, Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry followed him. British teens began playing the blues, imitating various styles of American blues. Gradually, a new distinctly British sound arose by the mid-1960s, called Beat. This form of the blues, and various derivatives, became massively popular in the US, leading to the British Invasion and British R&B."<br>  <br>  Or are you asking which English person started promoting the blues?<br>  <br>  Wikipedia says; "The scene coalesced around two figures, Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies, who started a blues club in London’s Soho, The London Blues and Barrelhouse Club, at a time when many American blues artists were also playing in London. Skiffle had run its course, and some musicians were seeking the real American roots music."|`|AA11826768	As an old blues fan i can say with authority that John Mayall is known as the father of British blues. Who knows where it started but the title is John Mayall,s.  Go back to the (turning Point) album and you will hear what i mean Eric Clapton (who every one wants to jam with) is on this recording. With Mick Taylor And Jack Bruce. Or try the album (Archives to eighties) some stuff there you wont find any where else.I remember when i was a kid in the early sixties we were not allowed to hear the blues. It was called ****** music and was going to destroy the white kids and of course decent society. John Mayall records were not known to the decent people so that is where we learned about the blues.Then the flood started, Cream with Eric Clapton,Led Zepplen with Jimmy Page, The Rolling Stones And Erick Burden And The Animals.A little group you may not have heard of The Silver Beatles. Later known as the Beatles. John Mayall started all that. The father of the British Blues. Give him his Props. Sorry didn't mean to sound like a preacher.|`|1oxBCtmZaa	If you mean music, John Mayall.<br>  <br>  If you mean the fc, Gus and John Mears.|`|AA11705909	Alexis Korner.|`|geq6iU0Oaa	The blues "movement in England grew out of the trad jazz and skiffle scenes, but also from servicemen (both American and British) introducing blues records to many. As others said, Cyril Davies and Alexis Korner are the most likely contenders for the title-Mayall was an acolyte of both and came slightly later.

O8kke1X5aa	thats like saying should girls be slaves, duh!|`|32sYRZb7aa	It depends. <br>  <br>  I don't think I could survive in certain shows, but others would be so cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'd also get to meet my favorite characters.<br>  <br>  But if you're talking about life being like an anime in general, with the complex story plots, dramatic expressions, and every other awesome thing that can be packed into an anime, I say YES. DEFINATELY!!|`|Rmqh8QEbaa	i think it totally should! that would be awsome. that would be cool then we could do all sorts of things we normally couldnt like have invisable arms (elfen lied) and travel to sifferent worlds(tsubasa)!! lol thats just wut i think :P|`|HqyFyF8haa	Yes.<br>  Well, not the female slaves part, though.

1Cznz2mkaa	cuz it ain't their cup of tea douchebag.<br>  and i personally can't understand what the f*ck most of those guys are saying.  but i do like mastodon|`|l7fiAHRLaa	im so tired of these people commenting on rap questions to diss it|`|VH8q5HPaaa	Because Metal is for those like you and I who actually have a good taste in music to give a damn what the cool kids are listening to.|`|FtLXVUtTaa	Because rap is the "cool kids" music.  All the kids who want to be considered "cool" listen to rap because that is what is expected of them.  Just look at rap culture.  Look at the things it glamorizes.  I see kids all the time who are wannabe gangsters or wannabe pimps.  They are people who have never been to a real ghetto and wouldn't last there.  People see death metal and they think, gee thats way to hardcore for them.  To listen to that might make them more of an individual, which you know is terrible.|`|WgIEetpFaa	cause rap is easy to listen to. You don't have to think about it. And most people are stupid. More people listen to death metal than they listen to tech n9ne. it's because tech n9ne is hard to listen to. It's too complex. People want watered down crap that doesn't make you think. That's why people like little wayne and rihana and not yngwie malmsteen and morbid angel. It's also the reason that most people don't like classical music. I mean, death metal has a bigger audience than classical music.|`|ItoZSfzvaa	some people just have different tastes of music. i listen to rap because i like it, not cause i want to be "cool".|`|PZu63bzPaa	Because they can tap their fingers on a table and make a beat but can't play a guitar worth ****, actually it's just a matter of opinion lol but stick with Lamb of God and you'll be alright!

joQ6cZ5Maa	That is to each person's preference.<br>  <br>  I do prefer Survivorman as Les does the filming by himself and not with a camera crew that is beside him. Do you really think that the camera crew for Bear Grylls will allow him to do something stupid that will risk injury or death, I think not. <br>  <br>  Both shows are good and do have useful information.|`|5Pgs61ePaa	Survivorman|`|Z3wg4Z3daa	Bear Grylls has been exposed as a fraud.<br>  <br>  Les Stroud > Bear Grylls|`|wtQY6VEwaa	While it is easy to say that survivorman is better, you have to watch each show in a different way.<br>  <br>  Surviorman is obvious. He goes out for a week by himself and actually survives. He does all of his own camera work and lugs around 150 lbs of gear while he does it. He'll even do those long shots where he walks away from the camera towards the horizon. You know he just has to go back and pick it up. I sure wouldn't do that.<br>  <br>  Anyway, you have to watch Man vs. Wild in the right light. You are an idiot if you think that bear grylls is really out by himself. There is obviously a camera man, and thus, a whole television show crew with him. You just have to watch it and realize how big of an idiot his is and enjoy it. Maybe play some drinking games, like<br>  drink everytime he eats something raw<br>  drink a couple everytime he eats something really disgusting<br>  drink 5 everytime he gets naked, jumps in freezing cold water, then gets out and does pushups<br>  drink a few everytime he does something that would seriously endanger his life, has medics not been part of his crew.|`|Q8wDjvZ1aa	i only watch survivorman. but he is pretty awesome!  you know who is cool though...MANTRACKER!!!|`|btrMdy5Uaa	I love Survivorman, Les Stroud is awesome!!!|`|iPpmhjR1aa	survivorman because he does all his own stuff, including filming, which makes his journeys twice as strenuous because he has to walk back and get his camera during shots. his work is very genuine.<br>  <br>  man vs wild does absolutely ridiculous stuff that will get anyone who attempts them killed if they seriously use them as a method of survival.  plus he has food and shelter and a camera crew.<br>  <br>  depends if you want entertainment or something real.  if you want something real, watch survivorman. if you think about it, it's basically a show about a guy that goes somewhere rough and doesn't eat for a week, and tries to keep warm.|`|nnKlpWhraa	I agree with Steven R. <br>  <br>  Bear(man vs.wild) has been exposed as sleeping in hotels when he is supposedly in the wild.<br>  Les does his own filming, and Bear has a crew with him the whole time. <br>  The only thing Steve(above me) didn't mention is that Les does have a crew. It's not a camera crew, and they are stationed away from him. But they are there, via radio, in case there is an emergency, or his life is in danger.|`|AA10269501	Survivorman|`|bE1XFBfraa	Survivorman|`|yYNkP8NBaa	man vs wild|`|SzXyQR4maa	man vs. wild... that guys a beast

s03m87cGaa	That's a Big Yes for me!  What doesn't appeal to me lol?  Neil is the greatest drummer of all time not to mention one hell of a lyricist, Alex is so underrated & he's a sensational player.  And Geddy, i've never heard anyone spank a bass like Ged does!  I know many don't like his voice but that's one of my favorite things.  It's so unique, you instantly know it's Rush!  They are 3 of the best musicians in the world imo.|`|4t0X6cJ5aa	gotta love limelight and the vocals are so original you can always tell if its a rush song|`|vnQiDxOaaa	I hate them! They're horrible. Neil Peart is one of the most over-rated drummers of all time, Geddy Lee cannot play bass, he sounds like he doesn't want people to hear him sing, and The Guitarist justs blasts out static fuzz without any sense of melody. Its just nonsense from a bunch of idiots.|`|2DLqsVFcaa	love 'em.  the kick-*** song writing surrounded by awesome music.|`|qT8yID3Taa	I love rush, the drum solo's are insane along with the vocals.|`|yDdIBA1taa	one of the all time great drummers plays for them
s03m87cGaa	I Love Rush & i'm female 25 yrs old.<br>  <br>  But I know what you mean.  All the Rush concerts i've been to there are very few women there.  :/  Not sure why though...I maybe see 2 women to every 20 guys.|`|71SjVwWNaa	Good Question. I've never really thought about that, but i kinda think your right.I know a few female friends who like Rush but not nearly as many as male. I'm going to star and hope someone can help you better. The only reason I can think is they have never been exposed as much with radio play. The radio stations in my area only play a few songs, Tom Sawyer, Fly by Night.|`|AA11430900	I've been a Rush fan as far back as I can remember because I was raised on them.|`|2DLqsVFcaa	because they have been around almost as twice as long as people your age.  every time i have seen them in concert;  there wasn't a shortage of female fans.|`|flU2gf54aa	Good for you Amanda.<br>  Dan A  is probably another clueless gay jonas brother fan|`|RtG5Iarbaa	My guess is the vocalist. xD I like them but sometimes, I just can't.|`|TqG6v6ZKaa	i love rush. but i grew up on them. and alot of females nowadays tend to like a band because of how good looking they are, and not how talented the band is and if you haven't noticed....geddy lee is one ugly f*cker so alot of females wont even give them a second listen.
a231cd46589d3ea6efabcc68cdd6e69baa	He has some good points.  Sylar is a perfect example of the evil that can be done by people with super powers.  Even good people like Peter can accidentally wipe out millions.  And sometimes good people can be manipulated or pushed into doing incalculable damage.  While rounding them up isn't the solution, there really isn't a good solution.|`|zovrJ0yXaa	its massively hypocritical of him that he wants people locked up and basically tortured but he refuses to lock up peter, claire, or HIMSELF. on top of that he is massively condescending to people locked up who he has known for a long time and that just makes him obnoxious. that just means that i completely fail to sympathise with him in any way at all|`|z03coR1Oaa	no. you can not make judgements on people with out getting to know them some off those with ability's could and would want to do good in the world. Nathan is very confused but i think he'll come good in the end.|`|z7w6xyOKaa	I think it's pretty hypocritical of him seeing as how HE CAN FLY!!!|`|AA11966816	Not entirely no.|`|ty7oLY29aa	It shadows what's happening in the world today but not with people with powers/special abilities but far of people who are from far of country's in the world who are a threat to us and wont to do us harms. So we sent these people to camps like Camp X-ray in Cuba, even if thy are threat or not. So i think it is right for Nathan to put people who have powers/special abilities, but those who use there powers/special abilities for there own means or for evil. But not for the ones who use there powers/special abilities for good and helping others or even saving the world.|`|SSlz82Djaa	Nope. Look how it worked out for Magneto and his pals in X-men. Its a lose lose situation. Can't remove them all from society and if you make them outcasts/illegal, even good people with powers will do bad things in retalliation.|`|eiSaaLxUaa	Yes, Nathan is the only decent character left in Heroes, himand Sylar. The rest are boring now and this series is poor i think it should end.<br>  Claires acting is atrociuos!|`|1hS27eJuaa	yes it is wrong, it is basically another witch hunt all over again. and besides he has an ability too why not lock him self up.

HpcMz47Paa	I don't know the name or artist of the song during the car chase but the song that plays during his jump from the helicopter is Timebomb by Jessy Greene.

eOcc6EOeaa	removing vocals can be what you need, but sometimes on certain songs it doesn't work out too well. It may just lower the vocals, sometimes it may take a certain tune and the vocals, but I would suggest testing it out on different vocal removers first.

fz77R5Jmaa	I like the view<br>  they have fun opinions and it gets heated sometimes and i actually like that cuz its funny<br>  <br>  i think if celebrities are going to be asked to come onto shows they should be there for more than 10 minutes of talking or less---sometimes ive seen on late shows that they say well i wish we could talk more as they only got 5 min of time...i think thats disrespectful to make them come all that way for basically only a commercial break<br>  <br>  so if its based on having celebrities come on then i think there should be 10-15 min of talking amongst the hosts or host with fun games like Ellen does or Jay Leno with the Jaywalking before the celebs come on and not have half the show be all about wasting time with dumb games and timewasters before the celebs come on<br>  <br>  leno and letterman usually have 3 guests on per night: 2 to talk to and a band at the end but they start with the guests half way through the show which means only 30 min for 3 guests and that is counting the commercials so i personally think it is too jammed pack|`|RMrpXSa7aa	all the beautiful celebs|`|5b1c35be2738e515ba378aa9a50a6975aa	to know abt the reality behind the stage... all abt their expirience n life wht v don kno frm the reels...|`|de4dJ0cxaa	NOTHING

He's also been on Wheel of Fortune.<br>  <br>  The explains that it almost feels like an Out of Body Experience. It's like his ears were ringing the entire time on "The Price is Right" and he has a hard time even recalling the whole thing. He walked away w/ the Rice a Roni, and an ugly Statue. (To get up Stage) He says it wasn't worth the taxes he had to pay. YES they do take you to an area to get all your info for mailing you your prize and ya know...The whole 9 yards..<br>  On Wheel of Fortune, cu'z he spends MORE time on stage, he became more relaxed, but when he made a stupid guess on a puzzle, it kinda stunned him and that was all he could think of after that. So his head wasn't in the game. He lost there too.<br>  So it's obvious he'll NEVER be bright enough to go on Jeopardy. Thank God, he's already put enough shame on the family. hahahaha-kidding! It was fun to watch.<br>  The prizes are sent to you in most cases. He did get to bring the ugly dog statue home though, but had to fill out a tax form first.<br>  <br>  Hope this clears up some wonders.

wFMhmZCYaa	I don't like Tatiana either, Norman was so funny|`|NQ3eETlYaa	Norman Gentle shouldn't have made it from the start. And Tatiana was actually good. She even said that her being crazy wasn't her usual self. And Jamar was good, I agree. I hope they bring him back.<br>  <br>  SCREW NORMAN GENTLE!!!|`|jUg9HAOjaa	I must admit at first I wasn't a big fan of Tatiana, because during the auditions we actually saw her laughing and crying more than we heard her sing, but she really blew me away during her performance.<br>  She had some of the best vocals that night (and much better vocals than most contestants in round two) and I truly think she would have made it if she hadn't been depicted as "the crazy girl" during the audition rounds (a lot of artists are emotional wrecks...and if it's something she has been working for for a long time, her outbursts are understandable).<br>  It's sad that people with no talent whatsoever will be advancing forward, like Michael Sarver who was terrible, but got through by getting sympathy points with his sob story.<br>  He got love from the judges while they barely gave Tatiana any credits for her beautiful rendition. This show is getting faker every year. If Simon and company had admitted she was really good that night she would probably have made it in the top twelve. But no...all they could say was "you're too demure...we like you better when you act crazy"; I was really shocked by their comments.<br>  I thought this was a singing competition...judges... that wasn't fair .<br>  <br>  I truly hope Tatiana gets the wild card.<br>  If not...I'm sure she'll go far anyway, it's not the first time American Idol bypasses talent; but I'm sure I'm not the only one who noticed she can sing.<br>  <br>  Nick Mitchell probably is a good singer, trouble is he's never serious; obviously that helped him get through the judges' selection to the top 36...but you can't really judge his abilities. <br>  I think he definitely blew his chance at a wild card by overdoing it once again, now that he was on the show there was no reason to keep Norman Gentle around, it was time to prove he could sing without the shtick.<br>  He sure would make a hell of a drag queen though.|`|7qNJg8DTaa	I agree 100%

fKcr6KU0aa	Wow, long list!  I don't have too much to add.<br>  <br>  For anime:<br>  Marmalade Boy<br>  Boys Over Flowers (Hana Yori Dango)<br>  Pretear - a "snow white" type anime with "knights" rather than dwarfs.<br>  <br>  For manga:<br>  Honey Hunt<br>  From Far Away (premise is a little like Fushigi Yugi)<br>  W Juliet - it's kind of a reverse Hana Kimi...it's a guy pretending to be a girl, since his dad won't let him be an actor otherwise.<br>  Tenshi Ja Nai!! (I'm No Angel!) - Ditto "W Juliet"...guy crossdressing as an actress, and the girl who finds out and gets caught in the middle of this.<br>  Please Save My Earth - manga about a set of classmates who find out that they were reincarnated from scientists on the moon.  Lots of romantic entanglements in that one - a lot of which are one-sided.  (Anime is good, too, but is also very short.)<br>  <br>  either anime or manga:<br>  Kamikaze Kaitou Jeanne (about a female thief.  Same creator as Full Moon)<br>  Honey and Clover (kind of...it's college drama/comedy/romance about art students)<br>  Nodame Cantabile (kind of...it's college comedy/romance about an orchestra)<br>  <br>  If you are okay with magical girl anime: Sailor Moon, Cardcaptor Sakura, Princess Tutu.  All of these have romance.  (And Princess Tutu is really classy and highly recommended.)<br>  <br>  Also, if you liked Loveless - Gravitation, Junjou Romantica, Sukisho, and Gakuen Heaven.  Also La Esperanca for manga.<br>  <br>  Hana Yori Dango and Nodame Cantabile also have live-action dramas, as does Hana Kimi.|`|AYIBXhLoaa	Junjou Romantica, Ouran High School Host Club, Gravitation, Papa to kiss in the Dark, those are the popular ones I can think about right now tehee:333<br>  <br>  Wanna watch my Loveless video??<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsPxTyffqU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GsPxTyff...</a>

Although Beast is my favorite X-Men in the animated series, so was Nightcrawler.|`|cIqpL3tGaa	They kinda are doing a 4th, in a way of a spin off.|`|waGFlfRUaa	"X-Men: First Class", the 4th X-Men film is set to be released in 2010. "X-Men Origins: Magneto" is set for a 2011 release And as you probably already know, "X-Men Origins: Wolverine" is set for May 1st. 2009 release... And, as for a "X-Men Origins: Storm", Halle Berry at last word has said no. So that one is up in the air...|`|h2bpjvG4aa	Villains would be Sentinels, i gorget who made them but have it set in the timeline of Days of Future Past where mutants are being hunted down and exterminated.

zovrJ0yXaa	to be honest, i enjoyed seeing riley and buffy together just to see angel come along and smash his face in. that was a fun episode. otherwise, i dont think the problem was with him so much as the entire initiative in the first place, he was just boring. my least favourite character is probably the first. maybe its not fair naming a character who you never actually see but he was a really terrible villain. cant hurt anyone, cant see him, just not threatening. if you want an actual character then i'll go with forrest gates. he was rileys friend, and while i never really disliked the guy, im choosing him purely on the basis of his one horrendous bit of acting after he gets robotified.|`|XnGCW0k0aa	riley is definitely one of my least favorite because he just seems to make buffy's life worse and he is selfish as he wants a girlfriend weaker then himself. However my least favourite is probably ben - glorys mortal coil. Simply because he was, boring, weak willed and dumb|`|45o6Z25Paa	Harmony.. she is the most irritating vampire in BTVS|`|a231cd46589d3ea6efabcc68cdd6e69baa	Spike, because he's a rapist.

Jb2l8uCBaa	creativity<br>  skilled drawings<br>  anime stories always have some sort of quirk to them like "the chosen one" or "the one with many powers" or something like that. Basically one or more of the characters have a special power or physical feature. Try Designing your main character first. Then the enemy. Maybe a few henchmen. The main character always has friends accompanying them along the way. In the beginning the main character always starts out poor [they make friends along the journey] and some old wise person [who was a previous hero] comes to tell them the world's life depends on them and explains what they need to do to complete their "quest" and gives them a "gift" to help them along the way. That gift is usually the "special" feature. There's always an enemy. That enemy knows of the "prophecy" and sends minions out to stop the main character from saving everybody. There's a traditional anime storyline. Have fun!|`|NQ5MYRauaa	Read Bakuman.<br>  I know this sounds like false advertising and unnecessary recommendations, but trust me, it WILL answer your question.|`|Rpf3OmsHaa	hmm...well first anime comes from manga (japanese comics) so if you really wanted to start your own story line you would have to draw a manga and hope it becomes popular. Becominga Mangaka (manga artist) is a very hard buissnes to get into. You should start by going to a art school to make sure your animation skills are pro. Also learn how photoshop (used a lot in manga) and 3D animation (used alot in anime) Practise makes perfect. They're is only a few that make it big. But follow your dreams!!

HNaeWVHKaa	More than likely Madara is using Pain. Pain afterall has destroyed Konoha (pretty much at least) and is fighting and killing off ninjas in the leaf village. So Madara who has always wanted to destroy Konoha has used Pain to do so. Perhaps not directly, but Pain is there fighting in Konoha and so Madara's goal is achieved.<br>  <br>  Or so it would seem.<br>  I reckon after Pain is killed, Konoha will still be left standing and Madara's obsession at destroying Konoha will eventuate in him fighting with Konoha right after Pain dies - destroying the place while their ninja forces are weak.

a3C6DeNeaa	They're usually called aerial or flying rigs, they're what allow you to do jumping or flying objects in stop motion. You can't get them in any stores, since there is no company that mass produces them. The Stop motion team working on those movies made them for use on the movie itself. But since you've seen them and know how they work, you could probably make a make-shift one yourself.

I'm glad he lost advertisements with double mint gum and that kind of stuff.|`|vqqxD6Teaa	It's up to you but I know I would no be able to support a "man" who beats his girlfriend and then doesn't even have the decency to truly take responsibility for his actions.|`|OEaqkDdVaa	You can still listen to the music, but just not support 'him'.|`|s67Abv31aa	His music didn't beat the hell out of Rihanna. Yeah what he did was Absolutely stupid, and her going back to him ain't exactly smart either. You necessarily dint have to support him a a person but it's okay if you still like his music. Its like not liking a girl at school but liking the poems she writes.|`|5a834Uyuaa	We'll all i know is i am. Rihanna forgives him so why cant you and all the pics you see of her aren't real pics from there fight it's pics from her car accident. I dont believe what the media says.

Give him a break and plus i love him very much and dearly for me to stop listening to music. ~It's your choice though~|`|OSTTJ2Wkaa	uh... yeah! <br>  Chris didn't do anything to Rihanna. There is no evidence towards Chris. Everyone needs to stop hating on him because he is a nice guy. When you find some proof come tell me because I see him as innocent as a bunny. Even if he did, don't hate on him. He is a nice guy because I've meet him before and we had a great time... ( as friends like playing ps3 or something like that). Don't Stop HaTiN On CB!!!!!|`|t5GHY6n1aa	with this whole matter, chris brown is like britney spears to me, i like britneys spears's music - but not who she is or what she trys to be.<br>  so its the same with chris brown, i <3 his music, but i hate him.<br>  its your choice!<br>  Ox.|`|QsbB6vkoaa	if you like his music i don't see why.<br>  but keep in mind that the only way he can learn his lesson, is if he suffers the consequences of his actions. and that means learning that women have self respect. and they wont put up with that kind of bull.|`|xaDK9Dceaa	I THINK CHRIS BROWN JUST MADE A MISTAKE LIKE EVERY PERSON DOES BECAUSE HE'S NOT PERFECT-NONE OF US ARE.

kGYL8a4Yaa	How does it make a man gay for listening to certain music? (Unless of course it's preteen music, such as Hannah Montana, then you have a point). <br>  <br>  Explain to me how it makes me gay because Boyz II Men is my favorite R&B group, or that R&B is my favorite genre of music. <br>  <br>  I'm straight. How do I know? Because I'm only attracted to women, real women, at that. <br>  <br>  The reason I listen to R&B "love songs" and "slow jams" is because I can connect to what they're singing about, I can relate to what they're singing about, because I currently have strong feelings for a girl, and I'd much rather listen to songs that remind me of her, than a song that doesn't. Make sense?<br>  <br>  Not all men have that arrogant attitude that Wayne displays in "Comfortable". I don't. I'm a sentimental kind of guy, I'd rather tell a girl that I'm attracted to that I'd rather have a relationship, instead of just relations. I don't "spit game" to a girl as Wayne does in numerous songs.<br>  <br>  Yes, I'm offended because you just attacked me because of my music preference.<br>  <br>  No, it's not gay for a man to listen to any song regarding love, it's called a preference, or an opinion.|`|UhtSE2B6aa	I don't understand how this makes someone gay?

ZyGyDLsDaa	Is it a balisong aka butterfly knife? It makes a rattling sound as it opens instead of the usual switchblade sound.<br>  <br>  From Wikipedia:<br>  A balisong, otherwise known as a butterfly knife or a Batangas knife, is a Philippine folding pocket knife with two handles counter-rotating around the tang such that, when closed, the blade is concealed within grooves in the handles. In the hands of a trained user, the knife blade can be brought to bear quickly using one hand. Manipulations, called flipping, are performed for art or amusement.<br>  <br>  If you scroll down, you can see a picture of one:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balisong_(knife)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balisong_(k...</a><br>  <br>  However, they don't list it under Media and Popular Culture. I'll see if I can find that film clip to check. // Here's a demonstration of one:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe-SCNPHz7w&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe-SCNPHz...</a>|`|ZMd5Ydehaa	nope but i luv that book and movie! lol maybe they said it in the book i forget

RppSsEpYaa	It wont get her back on idol but if record companies can see that she has a following it can help her get a record deal! If you wouldnt mind it only takes a few minutes to send in an e-mail saying you think that Idol mae a mistake letting her go! <br>  <br>  Also record companies look at myspace music plays when looking at people to sign so be sure to add her myspace and listen to her music! myspace.com/kristenmcnamara<br>  <br>  Also check out L.A.U.G.H. an organization that she co-founded last year! It is worth checking out!!!! myspace.com/laughmusic and laughmusic@live.com to add yourself to the e-mail updates list.<br>  <br>  So if you want to help Kristen get a record deal these are some great options to start with.<br>  <br>  Thanks!!!|`|v2xUy1dXaa	she was really amazing! but fox cant do anything about it, and i doubt they will put her back in.|`|qDctmJTeaa	no, she wasnt that great.|`|76740ad28a40658e6b40499a8b2cb447aa	I agree. I love her. She was actually my fave girl and I couldn't believe she didn't get voted in (I voted for her for 2 hours straight). And then for the Wild Card show, they brought back Tatiana and a bunch of guys I couldn't even remember, but didn't bring Kristen back. She picked the wrong song in Group 3, but she has a great voice and with the right song, she could've had a "moment". They do this every year,though. They always cut someone before the Top 12 who I feel should be there and is just as good as--if not better than--half of the people who made it through... Josiah Leming, Ayla Brown, Lisa Leuschner, Leslie Hunt,etc. But all of them went on to record Cds(Lisa and Ayla already released theirs and Leslie's and Josiah's CDs will be out this Spring),anyway. So i'm sure we'll still be hearing more of Ms. MacNamera. She definitely has the talent. She just needed some exposure,but now that her foot's in the door,she can go anywhere she wants. Besides, now she's free to get signed on an Indie label and make the kind of music she wants to make instead of the Pop garbage that Idol producers would've wanted her to make. So maybe it's for the best and I'm sure she'll be just fine. I will miss her on the show, though :(.<br>  <br>  PS She has some original songs on her MySpace page that are really good. You could check them out, if you're interested.

m4PtEEDNaa	...as ludicrous as your idea suggestion is, I really have to admit, in applying a little wild imagination, as well as taking what I know about Godzilla's history, and Chucky's history, there might actually be a semblance of an idea here....<br>  <br>  ...rather than trying to re-birth himself in the body of someone young, Chucky (..aka serial killer Charles Lee Ray) gets this unconventional and revelational epiphany of transferring his soul into some powerful and indestructible god-like creature, and that turns out to be Godzilla; however, in order to do this, Godzilla must be extraordinarily weakened in battle.  With the intent of porting his diabolical and supernatural skills of transferring his soul from one vessel to another, Charles Lee Ray inadvertently stumbles across the humanoid robot android, Jet Jaguar...for years, deactivated, and collecting dust in the basement of an old abandoned research facility.  With a little fateful luck, Charles/Chucky accidentally figures out how to activate Jet Jaguar, but not before reading the dark-dimensional storm-bringing black mass incantation, which initiates his soul transference into the mechanical fighter.  Using Jet Jaguar's ability to grow to a towering height, Charles/Chucky quickly initiates an earth-shaking battle with Godzilla, who is naturally taken aback by Jet Jaguar and his vicious attack, having previously fought beside each other, against Megalon and Gigan...<br>  <br>  ...I really wouldn't want to spoil what happens next, but in the end, this wouldn't be so much a far-fetched idea, than originally thought, right???<br>  <br>  ...so, when do we start filiming??  (...LOL!!!)|`|RQuSdG8jaa	I'd watch it and yeah Chucky would win.|`|rRIiY6Itaa	How the hell would chucky win??<br>  <br>  A plastic doll runing around a city trying to beat godzilla?

And when it subsides you have to make a decision. You have to work out whether your roots have so entwined together that it is inconceivable that you should ever part. Because this is what love is. Love is not breathlessness, it is not excitement, it is not the promulgation of eternal passion. That is just being "in love" which any fool can do. Love itself is what is left over when being in love has burned away, & this is both an art & a fortunate accident. Those that truly love, have roots that grow towards each other underground, & when all the pretty blossom have fallen from their branches, they find that they are one tree & not two..."|`|OBuzcIDbaa	fairy dust and moon beams|`|4k5MkmInaa	Lots of secret ingredients.|`|a8Anxhvaaa	Love is an irresistible desire to be irresistibly desired. <br>  Robert Frost|`|iKmkRaqBaa	Love is a vaccum box surrounded by feelings.|`|NLsaNo6taa	bullheadedness|`|rEWZWZi5aa	letters|`|1634875a2112f90de61c5b890983ed03aa	Devotion, time, loyalty, mutual respect, kindness and sacrifice.

Not everyone is lucky enough to spend that much time with one person that they love with all their heart. Yours was a very special love, my friend.<br>  <br>  I think love consists of mutual attraction, strong and loyal feelings for one another, honesty, respect, feeling lost when that person isn't around, admiration, whispering sweet nothings to each other, feeling totally comfortable with that special person, wanting to spend your remaining life with someone, feeling uninhibited about your feelings,  being able to express your feelings with your partner, feeling a deep-down sense of warmth and comfort, knowing that no other person can make you any happier than the relationship you're in right now, a hug, a kiss, feeling committed, being devoted to each other, showing compassion and interest, being glad to share anything you have with that other person, having no regrets, being grateful for the other, not taking the other for granted, not letting differences of opinion influence your feelings for one another, tolerance, tears of joy and pain, peacefulness, making sacrifices for the other, and an overall feeling of total satisfaction. <br>  <br>  Sometimes the little things are what we remember most and treasure. The act of making love is always a beautiful bonus that factors in, as well. You should be able to show and convey to someone the love you are feeling inside. Try to cherish those fantastic memories that the two of you shared. To not do so is punishing yourself and that isn't what your dearest Gwenneth would want. Think of all the good, fun times that you had together You are a lucky woman to have had one partner for all those years! <br>  <br>  Memories are what two people make them, my friend -- be they terribly bittersweet, absolutely horrible or unbelievably and undeniably beautiful, dearest lady.

She was walking naked around her room, and she squatted and took a crap in the corner - and then she told me to clean it up.  So I went and got the pooper scooper she uses for Zahara and Shiloh (she's having a difficult time potty training them) and just couldn't help sniffing it to see what her crap smells like... because, after all, she is Angelina Jolie... and for some strange, unknown reason, I got a strong whiff of tropical fruit.

a1Ngi39Xaa	I thought this was going to be a Van Halen question when I clicked on it...<br>  <br>  Cool video!<br>  <br>  Mick Jagger is one of the most active vocalists at a concert - not sure it's dancing but he climbs all over everything!!<br>  <br>  My personal vote is for Ian Astbury of The Cult.  He dances with the microphone stand like no one else I've ever seen!!  He is totally awesome.<br>  <br>  In this video he uses a cordless mic which I have never seen him do at a concert - but he does dance a lot.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vneFS48Z4Ws&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vneFS48Z4...</a>|`|WU4MHq3aaa	Mick Jagger... <br>  <br>  PLUS HE HAS MARACAS!!!|`|fzqMOD4Waa	I think my beloved Bernard Sumner is a better dancer.<br>  <br>  Watch the start of this (actually watch the whole thing cause it is a f*cking awesome song, but the dancing is at the start.)<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3h_g1zGl0U" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3h_g1zGl...</a><br>  <br>  BQ: Don't really like metal and don't get VH1 so no.

vyLS1Qcaaa	I agree she did have more class than some of the girls. Yet, I don't think that it was classy to date both brothers.|`|oP3V6Ka1aa	Yup i agree with you too she made chance realize that she wanted him for real but in the other hand she has been appearing on music videos like Jim Jones's Pop Champagne and most video girls are hoes.
ownoc1ZJaa	But the fact is, that's how Bret likes them - blonde, ditzy and drunk.  Says a lot about him, I think.|`|eEoeURDHaa	All of the girls I've seen on there look trashy with fake boobs.<br>  <br>  Of course, that's the kind of woman Bret would get, seeing as how it's not 1987 anymore.<br>  <br>  *Hey Layne, I bet the show killed more brain cells than pot ever will huh?

Priceless!|`|PVfBposgaa	I know!! It makes me so annoyed!!  Shes always trashing all the other girls.. Its like.. Uhh.. your spose to be there for bret, not to be trashing them, when shes the nasty one. I cant believe the things shes done. And shes just ... Uhh. <br>  I honestly hope Bret isnt stupid enough to pick her, otherwise here comes another rock of love 4... I think thats when I cut it off! lol<br>  Do you notice she always calls everyone fat, and you see her always saying "i want a cheese bugar" or when she was trying to microwave some nasty cabbage stuff.<br>  All's she does is get drunk.... I do think they are keeping her on to get views though! But they do seem like theres a connection. !! He needs to give her the boot soon!!|`|vGTzWCjraa	She's still on there because of ratings only.  VH1 knows that people will keep tuning in hoping that she gets kicked off because she's so annoying and two faced.  I doubt she'll win even if he only dates her for 2 wks after she's not the type you take home to meet the family.  But I wonder how much of the ***** attitude is the producers telling her to act up.|`|bmhT1IrTaa	he's probably jst keeping her on the show to get more views... she's entertaining to most people. well....morons entertain me<br>  and your right she's trashy and a bimbo|`|0vm66wlcaa	I am having a harder time believing someone actually watches that show.|`|4bc3ee931fca2067bef8aafb614f2089aa	Yes.|`|UAHjJpC0aa	he was with Pam Anderson for a year before she hooked up with Tommy<br>  I ran into them at a Harley "Love Run" in LA.....<br>  <br>  what did you expect?<br>  <br>  lol|`|wGRfFJmDaa	this show rocks he should do one every year but ashley is hot so is mindy yummmmy|`|f948d748facdf196074d849ea9c465c4aa	I watched that show for like 3 minutes when i was stoned once,i think i lost like 15 IQ points that day.....|`|NC67WVlEaa	I really couldn't care less.

Not me. All teens take pics. Everybody makes mistakes.<br>  <br>  Miley Ray Cyrus is the greatest.<br>  I <3 Miles.|`|OLl5Zc6baa	well i dont care but my sister likes her shes 15 and she thinks<br>  <br>  1.good voice<br>  2.good rolemodel<br>  3.good performer<br>  4.regular actress<br>  5.no she can get famous on her own|`|NmVqS2Biaa	YES!!!!!!!!<br>  all five reasons!!!!<br>  <br>  also:<br>  1. her ego<br>  2. she's sooooooo mainstream<br>  3.

In these cases i usually have a small peace of hard paper in my palm that i always rub and twist. And after awhile i begin to concentrate on it more then i do on my surroundings. It doesn't help to completely vanish the scare but it does make me feel better.<br>  3.Also dont try to be good.Thats your mistake.I had to make a speech in front of the whole class on day and i knew it very very well, almost perfect. But it came out not as good as i've expected, but then when i relaxed and stopped caring about it and not really trying it came out rather well. So good luck!

wlaxCA3Iaa	I am entertained by both Harry Potter and Twilight. However I feel Harry Potter has more depth and a much more intricate plot than Twilight. Harry Potter is a timeless classic with dynamic characters that almost everyone can relate to and enjoy. Twilight on the other hand is not, it is a fantasy romance novel geared towards teenage girls who probably have not read anything other than the Gossip Girl collection. It definitely will NOT stand the test of time.|`|532891a16ef92bf68f727dbbe6fa180eaa	Harry Potter all the way! <br>  <br>  you can tells it beats twilight, hello the new harry potter book sold more then the whole twilight series sold in one day!|`|vIv6I0sYaa	What kind of Question is that seriously.<br>  obviously TWILIGHT|`|wig9WKPwaa	The difference: <br>  <br>  1) Harry Potter is well written, and Twilight is not.<br>  <br>  2) Harry Potter has actual themes, and Twilight does not.<br>  <br>  3) Harry Potter is a likable protagonist.

But here it is<br>  <br>  SPOILER ALERT!<br>  <br>  The whole time the boy was in the house, he (Jigsaw) knew the boy was safe, because he had his female protege watching over him.  You can see towards the end she takes the boy with her and makes sure he makes it out alive.  Jigsaw put him in the house, to test others (the people he was in the house with, as well as the boys dad).  The boys dad failed his own test (stay and listen to me, as Jigsaw told him, "and you'll be reunited with your son).  Unfortunately for him, the father wasn't able to "follow the rules" which ultimately lead to his own death.  The father was the target the whole movie, you just don't find that out, till the very end.|`|p5ZJfiIaaa	Watching it on TV are you? :)<br>  <br>  They are all some kind of criminal and did things to get Jigsaw's attention. Plus, the cop that is talking to Jigsaw through the movie, whose son is in the house with all those people, was the arresting officer of all the other people. So if they find out whose son he is... he could be in trouble.<br>  <br>  You have to watch the whole thing! Then it will make some more sense. . .|`|exvKeeKFaa	He put them in the house to lure the cop there to find his kid.|`|oOSNI3wbaa	wooooow........seriously?|`|1qUokeKOaa	they are all in there for their own individual reason and jigsaw released a lethal toxin in the house and if they dont find the syringes with the antidotes in them in a certain amount of time they'll die

I like the message contained in songs like "Wasted Years" and "Different Worlds".  I also like the way the bring out the futility of war with songs like "Pachendale", "the Longerst Day" and "The Trooper".<br>  <br>  I would say that "Wasted Years" has been something of a motto.  Really, letting what happened yesterday, or worrying about what might happen tomorrow is futile.  Try to live and do the right thing each day NOW, and let the cards fall as they may.<br>  <br>  I have too many songs to count that do that for me.  I will  list "Rainmaker" as one, that I always am in th emood for.<br>  <br>  I thouroughly HATE "Bring Your Daughter to the Slaughter"  and "Como Estas Amigo".  <br>  <br>  Hmmm... Favorite SInger.  That is tough, as I listen to a lot of great singers.  Bruce Dickinson is certainly one, for the pure energy he imbues each song with.  He makes every performance worthwhile.<br>  <br>  But probably right now, Amy Lee is my overall favorite.  She sings with such passiona nd emotion in her voice, that even htough I listen to many singers who are "better", the raw honesty in her voice wins over the better "technique".<br>  <br>  **I limited most of the answers to my favorite band in an attempt to keep my answer under one of my infamous 2 page treatise.|`|4bc3ee931fca2067bef8aafb614f2089aa	The Smashing Pumpkins<br>  I'm sure, but I can't think of it.<br>  Snail<br>  With Every Light<br>  Starz<br>  Billy Corgan. His voice is very unique. He has many voices. It's hard to explain his voice. It's pure heaven.|`|fSYDOxX8aa	My favourite band is Queen, but I get the feeling you might have already known that.<br>  <br>  Song I like for its spine tingling beauty:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBJ9RUHMuwU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBJ9RUHMu...</a><br>  <br>  Influence?<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JofwEB9g1zg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JofwEB9g1...</a><br>  <br>  This one always amuses me:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CkzXroTbv8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CkzXroTb...</a><br>  <br>  It's not so much the song itself, but I think its overused and a bit overrated:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlFZ2w0RV-8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlFZ2w0RV...</a><br>  <br>  Favourite singer would be Freddie Mercury (surprise surprise). Because he could sing so well over a large vocal range, both in the studio and during live performances. He could sing both sombre and frivolous songs believably. And I happen to like his voice quite a bit.|`|Rc5oLRXAaa	The Red Hot Chili Peppers<br>  Under The Bridge<br>  Knock Me Down or Give It Away<br>  Under The Bridge<br>  Snow ((hey oh)). i love it, but even people that dont like rhcp listen to the song<br>  Anthony Kiedis or Freddie mercury. i love Freddie cause he can sing beautifully (bohemian rhapsody) and loud and kick ***(we will rock you). and i love anthony because of under the bridge|`|MwiBGBK1aa	- Tool<br>  - Right in Two, Lateralus, Eulogy, Parabola, Wings For Marie<br>  - Too many.<br>  - Prison Sex or Rosetta Stoned <br>  - Sober, Jimmy<br>  - Maynard James Keenan is one of my favourite vocalists of all time. I don't have to say much about him... just listen to his voice it's easily recognizable and easy to distinguish. Can be very calming, but he can scream.<br>  <br>  p.s that "Hey hey hey my beauties" reminded me of Conan O'Brien, when he says "Hey hey hey, stay cool ma babies!"...yeah|`|NC67WVlEaa	What's YOUR personal favorite band, anyway? Nirvana<br>  Any song of their's in particular send shivers down your spine because of its beauty? Heart Shaped Box and they're cover of Where Did You Sleep Last Night by Leadbelly.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xHl-P_arVA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xHl-P_ar...</a><br>  What song has influenced you the most? Hmmm... Radio Friendly Unit Shifter by Nirvana or Gouge Away by Pixies or even Hey Bulldog by The Beatles.<br>  What song puts a smile on your face? (Especially when you're shuffling 100 km/h through your music playing device and you hear it's first few chords :D) Any Ramones song and Hotwax by Beck.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPFjuX4MMd0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPFjuX4MM...</a><br>  What song do you dislike (not absolutely hate...) that your fave band performs? Ummm.... there isn't one. I love 'em all.<br>  Who's your fave singer and what amazes you about their vocals? A tie between Freddie Mercury and Robert Plant. Freddie had an amazing range and strength and Robert Plant's voice is just unique and powerful.
qh01jOuWaa	try absolutefretboard.com - they have a free intro lesson series (by email) that you can sign up for, you'll get lessons for a couple of weeks on mastering the fretboard.  You can also go to youtube and search through various videos available there to help you with your learning paths. That can help you get kickstarted.  Also, you can pick up learning books at the secondhand book stores, or try searching on half.com, albeit the book stores and half.com are not free but are cheap.  Hope that helps.|`|ECjnQ4HHaa	guitar.about.com is a good place to learn guitar, plus its free.<br>  as a beginner i recommend getting a tuner, and if its an electric guitar: a cord and amp. you should also get extra strings.
wPlfPc0gaa	Yes, there are a lot of combinations and permutations, which have not been talked about. So lets assume, at least one of them is telling the complete truth.<br>  <br>  On closer examination, there are only 2 possibilities: 1. Michael Killed, Peter abetted or 2. Ajit Killed, Michael abetted.<br>  At no point Michael denied doing it, but did not accept it as well. From the first part of Michael's statement, either Ajit & Michael did it, or they didn't. If Ajit killed and Michael accompanied him, then Michael's statement is a lie. If it is true, then Michael was with Peter, they together may have committed the crime. But calling Peter into the picture, Robert did not kill or abet. Since nobody accused Robert, lets assume Peter is telling the truth and it follows Peter was not involved in the crime. So the only possibility is Ajit is the murderer and Michael is the accomplice.|`|7c41d0650d2d056239986df304fa0bb4aa	all the combos needed are in the quotes from the suspects. it is the correct answer. is this a MindTrap question by any chance?

XBGaYJ2waa	I watch it every week, its one of my favorite shows.|`|a231cd46589d3ea6efabcc68cdd6e69baa	How many people watch it is irrelevant.  All that matters is how many Nielsen families watch it.|`|AA11033942	Think of the story from the point of view of the film chronology. <br>  <br>  In Terminator 3 Rise Of The Machines, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) refused to appear for a number of reason not discussed here, so it was written into the script and story that she died of leukaemia, and in the story line for the television series we see how she developed the disease, so she's gonna die anyway. <br>  <br>  Terminator Salvation opens up a long time after the third movie where Sarah Connor had long been dead, so if you think about it - despite it rewriting some of the history. It's gonna end eventually anyway, so the better thing to do is campaign for story continuity and to go out on a high.

I have made shy people come out of their shell, idk, i just have a knack for that, i guess i see something in their eyes, like they want to join in and have fun but well are too shy and don't know where to start, and well i give them the confidence to do that!!<br>  :)|`|kA7GEKf7aa	No I once was one.

However, these people usually have a few really close friends that they are always with an spend all their time with. This type of people also doesn't seem to care what others think and have a great time with their best friends. But my best friend is really shy and i don't hate her. sometimes they do make me mad when they just sit there and don't say a word in the conversation but they sit and listen. You don't Even know their there and you say things that you dont want a lot of people to know and the shy person hears cause their just hanging around.|`|mTauSxzfaa	When I was a kid, I never liked it a whole lot when a girl was shy. It made her so hard to talk to and connect with. However, after high school, I really appreciated the quietness of a soft spoken girl, rather then a loud one.

They always sound, well i use the word constipated when descrribing it, but i found that "gotta be somebody" sounded a lot different from there usual stuff, its probably my favourite song currently at first i didnt even know they sang it.|`|eEoeURDHaa	I hear all 3 on the radio when my little sister is in the car.<br>  <br>  I hate The Killers, Coldplay is boring, and Nickleback is annoying, but if I had to listen to one of the three, I pick Nickleback.|`|r672NkKbaa	Nickelback pisses me off so much.. the vocals are annoying and tasteless.. i dont understand why so many of my friends like them..<br>  the ONLY song that i ever liked from them is bottom of every bottle|`|fPnzskQuaa	well, for one, Nickelback isn't being sued by Joe Satriani for copyright infringement..sooo...<br>  <br>  and i personally like them quite a lot. especially their album "All the right reasons"|`|0vm66wlcaa	At best, they are annoying.<br>  <br>  Post-grunge just kind of sucks, and I think Nickelback shows that a lot.<br>  <br>  But Coldplay and the Killers are not post-grunge, and in my opinion have only gotten worse over the years.|`|ZpR57jbBaa	well yeah the vocals can sometimes be annoying but in the end i still like'em|`|73760ec70f62b217eab4a5ab28ce822baa	I agree. My husband is a big Nickleback fan, and I just don't get what he hears in them. Oh, and if I remember correctly, it was just Chad Kroeger who sang the "Hero" song for Spiderman; not the whole band.|`|f948d748facdf196074d849ea9c465c4aa	Yeah and you know what confuses me Matt Cameron played the frums on that hero song wtf he must have been blackmailed|`|AA10795350	Coldplay... Nickelback... similar.<br>  <br>  *one sad Coldplay fan*|`|4bc3ee931fca2067bef8aafb614f2089aa	Yup.<br>  Why improve or experiment when you know people will listen to what ever you produce?

kFOxlebDaa	When some one says that it usually means.. for example..dont do something you cant take back.. <br>  I know what I mean I just dont know how to tell you.<br>  Like.. if you have a girl or boyfriend and you cheat on them.. thats burning your bridge because you cant take that back. Their trust you had is now on the other side of the water and your bridge is gone so you cant get it back<br>  Sorry if thats no help!|`|ej0XGkh8aa	If you burn your bridges, you do something that makes it impossible to go back from the position you have taken.<br>  Our relationships with others are like bridges that take us from one place to another; when we "burn our bridges" we destroy our relationships and it is difficult to go back.<br>  "Don't burn your bridges" means that it is important to remember and value the relationships that get you where you are and not damage those relationships.|`|r2YINLobaa	It's like taking out all possible ways of escaping because they're so into your mind. Since bridges are a way to "return" or "retreat", when you burn them it's like there's no way to go back. It's supposed to be romantic, also in heels over head by boys like girls|`|kJqztlvCaa	To burn a bridge means to cut off your way to retreat.

19118ef0907ef0b119cc1faefbfca6f1aa	I hate the PPD storyline.  Is it really neccessary for the writers to ruin Robin's dream of motherhood and her happily ever after?  She was soo looking forward to being a mom.  The storyline totally pisses me off.  They already did this storyline w/ Carly when Michael was born.  Come up w/ some new material people!  It would have been totally different if they had Carly and Robin interact more.  Maybe get Carly to get Robin to see that she has a problem and Carly forgives her for telling A.J. about Michael.  They come to a sort of understanding.  But no they can't even do that.|`|5f0111f71db8592710a5d1cb4897be4aaa	I am SO sick & tired of her at this time !<br>  <br>   I just started liking her again  and now she's out telling strangers that she has no children >>> I cant believe that as honest as Maxie is,,,she wont tell her like it really is ! Maxie needs to sit her down and tell her HOW crazy it was for her to leave the house on that snowy night ( Robin is a DOCTOR  and should have thought about a cool bath first to take the fever down instead of rushing out and breaking down ONLY to hide Poor Little Emma in the tree ) Robin is NOT the hero here .>>>. Johnny & Maxie are for finding her crAzY A$$ out there freezing to death !<br>  <br>   ohhhh,,,don't even get me started here ,,,lol,,,I could go on for hours.<br>  <br>  <br>   I hope the writers; bring her back soon ,,,I was looking forward to Patrick & Robin being a happy family and having the child of her dreams.|`|3d40b4f2a24630bfafce9bb96d212203aa	I kind of agree with everyone, I get that they want to show PPD as a real condition and should to be address publicly HOWEVER I don't think Robin was the perfect character to write this story line for because it makes no sense. Especially since her and Patrick are doctors! I mean everyone knows Robin is off and doing strange things, even Patrick has the answer in front of his face and can make a sound medical decision base on reasons but he chooses NOT to? I mean come on, give me a break already, I wish the writers get this part over with and just give her treatment|`|CFZ4ISNNaa	PPD is an important issue, but the storyline is painful to watch. Hopefully it will be wrapping up by the end of March sweeps. And hopefully Robin will get help and occupy her time with trying to wake Michael up.|`|jfriQ8pmaa	I was a bit sick of her before the PPD.  For a while, I couldn't watch the PPD scenes (Robin just standing there as her baby cried etc), but now I'm finding it more watchable since she and others are realizing there is a problem!|`|ADBMrG87aa	I'm way past sick and tired of Robin already!  I can't stand looking at her or listening to her neverending pity party drivel anymore!  Get that irritating whiny twit on my tv screen already GH writers!|`|msUIsv8maa	Ok theve told the story they should move on.This beats all ive ever seen to turn a situation like this into a i dont give a damn storyline both of these are drs someone would have made arrangements to get help this is Bull|`|tgVGE2Umaa	Yes and no, I'm definitely sick of her PPD storyline they are dragging it out wayyyy too much...other than that I like Robin on the show. :)|`|z9H5HqcBaa	Let me count the ways.   Her PPD (or should I say whining) started with the whole "I want a baby" routine, carried on through trying to find someone to donate sperm, to accidentally getting pregnant by Patrick, to all those months of the two of them constantly fighting. I can't tell you  how many times I was screaming at the TV and the antics of  those two.  <br>  The writers have turned Robin and her story lines into the worst character on GH.   When is everyone going to send her on a vacation till we get the REAL Robin back again. This characterization of Robin has turned me against someone that I've loved since Anna first introduced her to us.|`|BwHoLEHvaa	I agree!  I know that PPD is something that should be addressed, because it does happen to a lot of women.  <br>  <br>  But I also think that the writers are dragging this out.  It's time for Robin to "step up" & be a MOM, get the help that she needs.<br>  <br>  In the "scoops" it says that she leaves Emma at Kelly's when she's called in for an emergency.  Maybe this is the beginning of the end of this story...I sure hope so!|`|5JgchYUEaa	i truly hope that tptb will end the ppd story line. can someone please get her some counseling and some medication! STAT!!|`|4c53bf469dfe96ac19d353f625f2d1daaa	Yes defiantly sick of Robin! She is not her self at all.|`|EPPb5pRBaa	I have never like Robin on GH.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	She is suffering, it is a real condition, kudos to GH for telling the story.|`|xXa3eQOeaa	It's the writers, they are idiots.<br>  The character of Robin, is the poster-child for living a full life, with HIV.<br>  Over the years the writers seem to forget the "history" of their characters. It's sad enough that there IS such a thing as PPD, in new Moms. Carly had it, when she had Michael. The writers SHOULD use that fact, to have Carly "help" Robin through it. It would be so odd to have Carly help someone she once hated, but hey, it's the influence of Jax, in Carly's life, maybe. Just a thought.|`|YA4qCDukaa	what i think happened is that from the begging the writers wanted robin to have ppd but the wanted it to be nothing like carly's. (they wanted to raise awareness.) the first few weeks of this story line they played around with different scenario's (you can tell). the writers took so long to write the symptoms of her ppd that by the time they figured out what there were you were already sick to death of the way both she & patric were acting. i also think that the writers have mess up this story line, when carly had ppd you felt bad & sympathetic towards her. robin on the other hand your just annoyed with her behavior. ppd id a very horrible thing for a new mother to have & when writers put ppd in story lines yes it raises awareness about ppd but if not written correctly then it can be very irritating to watch. yes i am getting sick of robin with this story line that they have her in. the writers took to long in deciding the symptoms she would have & did not write it in a way that you feel upset that robin is going though this. it's annoying now & getting old fast. to the point that i can even watch her spew that crap when she talks.|`|sJs0nuTSaa	I'm more tired of Patrick not getting her some help.  I'm tired of the storyline.  I'm upset that she couldn't just have her baby and be happy.  It's been one problem after another.  But, I'm jaded.  I haven't liked Robin since she told AJ that Michael was his.  I'm still bitter about that one.|`|7XM4QJiuaa	I like Robin but this storyline being drug out to far.|`|nrqWwQBXaa	i know why can't they just make her be a good mom that would be so much better?

LSn5iF47aa	It was never explained as to how Haruhi's mother died. <br>  <br>  Most likely they thought she was crossdressing as a girl during the party and is a boy during the last scene.

Haruhi stated or there was a fact that her mother died when she was 6. Her mother died from a sickness or something. It might be a natural cause of death.<br>  <br>  As for the last episode, all the girls see Haruhi as a boy cross dressing as a girl. No one knows that Haruhi's a girl except for the boys of the Host club and Bosa Nova.<br>  <br>  Nope. The series is not finished. There's a manga for it.|`|9bDNQpqJaa	to answer all your questions:<br>  I think Haruhi's mother died of illness<br>  I don't think it matters to much because it didn't happen in the manga. in the manga episode 26 NEVER HAPPENED!<br>  I like the anime, but i think it's over. The manga is still going strong tho. ^^

Boston Rob was pretty good also.|`|DkRqv6bRaa	Johnny Fairplay|`|q34vCB3Qaa	johnny fairplay|`|IvIEpj9Kaa	Todd Herzog, the winner of Survivor: China was the best in my opinion. He played right from the beginning. He chose his allies strategically. He picked the one person he got along with, who he could trust, someone who he knew would be worse in challenges than he was so she'd be seen as the bigger detriment in challenges, someone who he knew better in challenges than he was so he's be seen as the threat in challenges, and someone who he could push the leader role onto, so nobody would see him as a leader. He let Aaron and Amanda each decide one elimination, so they felt like a part of his elimination. Amanda wanted Sherea out, which hurt Todd, because another ally, Courtney was friends with Sherea, and didn't want her to go. He then had to persuade Courtney that getting rid of her was the right decision. When the tribes switced and he lost Aaron, he quickly brought Frosti in to take his place, and strategically gave James two hidden immunity idols. In the merge, he placed all of his blindsides perfectly. He called out Jaime as the biggest strategic threat, and she was sent home. Then he had to convince him alliance to turn blindside of their own, and he got them all to get rid of Jean-Robert. He couldn't tell Denise about the plan for it to work, so after he did it, he had to convince her to come back to his alliance, which was hard considering the other alliance was also trying to get her, and it would've made more sense for her to go with them, so he had to do a lot of persuading, and he did. Then, he got his alliance to get rid of Frosti, including his best friend there, Courtney. In the top seven, Amanda had an idea to get rid of James, and the two of them convinced everyone to do it. The other alliance was trying to get Denise again, and it made no sense for her not do it, but Todd managed to convince her that staying with him was the better decision, and the final two members of the other alliance were eliminated. In the top four, Amanda knew she couldn't win against him, and Courtney caught him talking to Denise about who should go home. It was almost positive Todd was leaving at that point. He had to do some serious persuasion, and he managed to do it. At the end, the jury were all mad at him, and he had what many people consider to be the best final tribal council performance of all time, and he won with it. In other words, his strategy and persuasion let him control the entire game to go exactly how he wanted it to go.|`|bZzd1Z8paa	Bob the physics teacher from Survivor Gabon!<br>  <br>  Or perhaps Ozzy|`|5b774b8022ffdba0eef956713e227ae2aa	RUPERT!!!!|`|AxfcadrSaa	Rob Cesternino from Amazon (and All Stars)|`|aA4aAhyFaa	Tom|`|iK4pMtmzaa	Shii Ann from Thailand, and All Stars|`|HBFHZXybaa	Definitely not Richard Hatch thats for sure.

eVMJnNt1aa	"Thriller" is an early 1982 hit single recorded by Michael Jackson for the Epic label. It reached #4 in the U.S. singles chart and #10 in the UK singles chart. On February 20, 2006, the single, as well as the video, was re-released as part of the Visionary: The Video Singles package. The 14-minute video is regarded by many as the greatest music video of all-time, and the song itself is considered to be one of Jackson's signature songs. The single was released slightly earlier in the United Kingdom, in November 1983, reaching number 10 on the charts and staying on the chart until February 1984..<br>  <br>  ps..and the album choose as a biggest selling album of all time|`|iJXFZx7taa	Dunno.<br>  I don't have enough musical experiences to tell you that. =]<br>  <br>  But right now I really like My Chemical Romance's cover of "Desolation Row" by Bob Dylan.<br>  <br>  You should check it out if you like that type of music.|`|pYJ0I0cXaa	in my Humble opinion, it is:<br>  <br>  "Cherish" by the Association--some of you may be too young to remember because it is classified as an "oldie".|`|hFFIphqNaa	A Message to The Unknown by BlessTheFall.|`|0e7PIzPNaa	Jai Oh & Oh Saya from Slumdog Millionare's Soundtrack.

From that I can draw a few possible conclusions.<br>  * You simply misheard the number.<br>  *Frieza was only using the number as an approximation (Similar to how I may say, "I went on vacation a month ago" when in reality it was 6 weeks).<br>  *It was a translation error, or simply a plot hole.|`|gYmGiHcZaa	Freeza sucks at counting.

jpTl3o5naa	He's a jerk and unworthy of a good woman. Rhianna has a lot going for herself. She doesn't need Chris. I think his sentence will be less because he is a star with money or Rhianna won't prosecute him or testify against him. Love is not hurting the one you are supposed to love. He isn't a real man.|`|lGSUToFQaa	treated fairly, just sentence, no i don't, he will get a light sentence because he is famous, look at most recently martha stewart, look at oj simpson, i could go on, no he is famous so he will the the very least punishment possible that is what always happens, they get a fine when anyone else would go to prison, or they get a 1-3 when everyone else gets a 2-20 so no i don't think it will be just|`|k39bNUgeaa	well he is now facing 4 years probation and 8 months jail<br>  <br>  Any normal person would get 10 years in prison<br>  <br>  just because he is a celebrity he is getting an easy "punishment"|`|AA10382483	Hell no! The dude will walk unfortunately.|`|WyxxDgSeaa	I think people are getting carried away with the kind of sentence he might get if convicted. A first offender (if he is) on domestic violence is probably not going to get jail time. Rihanna's attorney likes to say that she will testify if called. She would be required to testify by law. But a luke warm testimony on the victim's part isn't going to add much juice to the DA's case. I expect Brown to go for a plea bargain and expect that he will get something like community service and be required to take a class and maybe probation. That's not out of line with any first offender of this kind.|`|0WFALNSvaa	he should get at lest 4 years in jail <br>  i do not like the fact dat Rhianna forget chris  i thought she would had stand up for people who is in domestic violence.|`|47e7f174343942df4985e92180812d30aa	No i doubt he will service anytime.. and btw hes already been convicted... he needs to spend time behind bars just like us ordinary people would...but he'll buy his way out. just like the rest did..

Domestic abuse always escalates. I mean, Lil Kim can serve a year for lying, and he doesn't get any jail time for, what really needs to be termed attempted murder? That would be ridiculous!<br>  <br>  Either way, his career is going to take a huge hit.

RLs0skyNaa	4 for u<br>  <br>  A man told the ringmaster that he was interested in joining the circus as a lion tamer. The ringmaster asked if he had any experience<br>  <br>  The man said, "Why, yes. My father was one of the most famous lion tamers in the world, and he taught me everything he knew."<br>  <br>  "Really?" said the ringmaster. "Did he teach you how to make a lion jump through a flaming hoop?"<br>  <br>  "Yes he did," the man replied.<br>  <br>  "And did he teach you how to have six lions form a pyramid?"<br>  <br>  "Yes he did," the man replied.<br>  <br>  "And have you ever stuck your head in a lion's mouth?"<br>  <br>  "Just once," the man replied.<br>  <br>  The ringmaster asked, "Why only once?"<br>  <br>  The man said, "I was looking for my father."<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  2. A driver is pulled over by a policeman. The police man approaches the driver's door....<br>  <br>  "Is there a problem Officer?"<br>  <br>  The policeman says, "Sir, you were speeding. Can I see your licence please?"<br>  <br>  The driver responds, "I'd give it to you but I don't have one."<br>  <br>  "You don't have one?"<br>  <br>  The man responds, "I lost it four times for drink driving."<br>  <br>  The policeman is shocked. "I see. Can I see your vehicle registration papers please?"<br>  <br>  "I'm sorry, I can't do that."<br>  <br>  The policeman says, "Why not?"<br>  <br>  "I stole this car."<br>  <br>  The officer says, "Stole it?"<br>  <br>  The man says, "Yes, and I killed the owner."<br>  <br>  At this point the officer is getting irate. "You what!?"<br>  <br>  "She's in the boot if you want to see."<br>  <br>  The Officer looks at the man and slowly backs away to his car and calls for back up. Within minutes, five police cars show up, surrounding the car. A senior officer slowly approaches the car, clasping his half drawn gun.<br>  <br>  The senior officer says "Sir, could you step out of your vehicle please!"<br>  <br>  The man steps out of his vehicle. "Is there a problem sir?"<br>  <br>  "One of my officers told me that you have stolen this car and murdered the owner."<br>  <br>  "Murdered the owner?"<br>  <br>  The officer responds, "Yes, could you please open the boot of your car please?"<br>  <br>  The man opens the boot, revealing nothing but an empty boot.<br>  <br>  The officer says, "Is this your car sir?"<br>  <br>  The man says "Yes," and hands over the registration papers.<br>  <br>  The officer, understandably, is quite stunned. "One of my officers claims that you do not have a driving license."<br>  <br>  The man digs in his pocket revealing a wallet and hands it to the officer. The officer opens the wallet and examines the licence. He looks quite puzzled. "Thank you sir, one of my officers told me you didn't have a license, stole this car, and murdered the owner."<br>  <br>  The man replies, "I bet you he's lying by telling you I was speeding, too!"<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  3. A husband and wife are traveling by car from Key West to Boston. After almost twenty-four hours on the road, they're too tired to continue, and they decide to stop for a rest.<br>  <br>  They stop at a nice hotel and take a room, but they only plan to sleep for four hours and then get back on the road. When they check out four hours later, the desk clerk hands them a bill for $350.<br>  <br>  The man explodes and demands to know why the charge is so high. He tells the clerk although it's a nice hotel, the rooms certainly aren't worth $350.<br>  <br>  When the clerk tells him $350 is the standard rate, the man insists on speaking to the Manager.<br>  <br>  The Manager appears, listens to the man, and then explains that the hotel has an Olympic-sized pool and a huge conference center that was available for the husband and wife to use.<br>  <br>  "But we didn't use them," the man complains.<br>  <br>  "Well, they are here, and you could have," explains the Manager.<br>  <br>  He goes on to explain they could have taken in one of the shows for which the hotel is famous. "The best entertainers from New York, Hollywood and Las Vegas perform here," the Manager says.<br>  <br>  "But we didn't go to any of those shows, "complains the man again.<br>  <br>  "Well, we have them, and you could have," the Manager replies.<br>  <br>  No matter what facility the Manager mentions, the man replies, "But we didn't use it!"<br>  <br>  The Manager is unmoved, and eventually the man gives up and agrees to pay. He writes a check and gives it to the Manager.<br>  <br>  The Manager is surprised when he looks at the check. "But sir," he says, this check is only made out for $50."<br>  <br>  "That's correct," says the man. "I charged you $300 for sleeping with my wife."<br>  <br>  "But I didn't!" exclaims the Manager.<br>  <br>  "Well, too bad," the man replies. "She was here and you could have."<br>  <br>  4.

hryaiAVNaa	holy ****! I just mentioned the Supervillains in a "whats your favorite song?" question.<br>  <br>  Check out "snow White" "robots in Heaven, Robots in Hell, St. Thomas, You Got Me, Ex Girlfriend, and more I can't even think of right now. They all rock!!! oh, and 'Little Girl' too. They also have a mean cover of 'Moving Out' that's up on their myspace page. <br>  <br>  Just do a search for Supervillains discography and you'll find all the available tracks they have. I have 80% of them and need to get their new album. These guys ROCK!!!<br>  <br>  ah heck, here ya go.<br>  <br>  1.20 Excuses<br>  2.Moonshine<br>  3.Little Girl<br>  4.Jumpin' Beans<br>  5.Beaches<br>  6.Surfin' USA<br>  7.Resin<br>  8.Punch Drunk Dub<br>  9.Ex-Girlfriend<br>  10.Baghdad<br>  11.Uno Momento<br>  12.Get out Da Way<br>  13.Breakfast on a Mirror<br>  14.Mary Jane & Jagermeister<br>  <br>  You Got Me<br>  2.The The Pit<br>  3.Home Again<br>  4.Be Alright<br>  5.Smoke 'Em<br>  6.Little Girl<br>  7.Irukandji<br>  8.Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)<br>  9.St. Thomas<br>  10.Get It Oun<br>  11.Crippy Weed<br>  12.Tortuosity<br>  13.Snow White<br>  14.Overdose<br>  15.Irukandji [Remix]<br>  16.You Got Me [Remix]<br>  17.Thank You's<br>  <br>  1.Gold<br>  2.Krippy Weed<br>  3.Be Alright<br>  4.Robots in Purgatory<br>  5.Robots in Hell<br>  6.Human Puke Machine<br>  7.Ois<br>  8.Dom Song<br>  9.You Got Me<br>  10.I Funked Your Mom<br>  11.Oh Lord One More Day<br>  12.Melissa<br>  13.Crew Cut<br>  14.Summer of 96<br>  15.Ronnie Dobbs<br>  16.Thank Yous<br>  <br>  They have a couple more albums than that though, but you'll have to search and see a track listing. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  As for other bands, I'm sure you're familiar with Sublime and Pepper. You may want to check out 'Five Iron Frenzy' a couple of NOFX tracks (check out Eat the Meek), Passafire, The Expendables, and last but not least, my favorite Seattle band "The Panda Conspiracy" (<a href="http://www.myspace.com/pandaconspiracy)" rel="nofollow">http://www.myspace.com/pandaconspiracy)</a> And you can even check out my own demos, which I have a couple up you might like. ( <a href="http://myspace.com/summersoundswell" rel="nofollow">http://myspace.com/summersoundswell</a> ) Mixing quality on the next ones to improve as I learn more and more about engineering.<br>  <br>  Their first album is so awesome. definately something to skank to. I don't own their second one yet, since they're not on a major label I couldn't find tracks on limewire. I liked em so much I bought their album. I really want the 2nd one.

tc5XLjUEaa	To tell you the truth if you are on the cusp which it seems you are then you can definitely carry traits of both signs! <br>  <br>  Try and figure out your moon sign and ascendant for more clarification!|`|HEnAekUxaa	aspicco gave the only credible answer. there is no such thing as a cusp. the sun cannot be in 2 signs at once. if you have characteristics of cancer, and you're birthday is June 19th, it is very possible to have any combination of mercury, venus, mars, moon, or other planets in your chart.|`|QymdQMUZaa	as its been said your on the cusp. my sister was born on the 23rd of oct and is either a scorpio or libra.... she has both characteristics. and so do you. also gemnis are two sided|`|ZA18KoC9aa	its possible|`|32P3hG0Laa	You didn't research enough. You have 10 planets in your chart. You are much much more than just your sun sign. You are a Gemini Sun, your Mercury and/or Venus could be in Cancer. Or your Mon could be. And there is your Rising Sign, too.<br>  <br>  And BTW, cusps are BS. <br>  <br>  Look at your full chart, using your birth day, year, time and place. That is your chart.|`|1cJjGNOBaa	yes, you are on the "cusp" of 2 signs and would carry the traits of both.... if you believe in that sort of thing!!!

LVZdzPmpaa	A company is hired to add the titles to a movie. In the credit, the titles are credited, which is how you know who did them. One of the production assistants keep track of credits for the movie and makes sure that the list is complete, then forwards it to the title company, which double checks. The producers decide who gets credit and which positions/contributions are credited. <br>  <br>  The position of creating the titles would require a background in graphic design as well as knowledge and familiarity with the various programs.|`|MAnl9IDoaa	iono but whoever they are they are a loser and they themselves don't get to be on the credits|`|geg7rsIHaa	Is that where all the MC's went?

5586ad15a09ab2f36457c1e8042071f2aa	No. Never. I do not believe there is any connection between my life, the Sun, Moon or the stars that predetermined my future based on a one time position of celestial objects when I was born. Consider, the woman in the next room from my mother when I was born, having a child as well. It seems illogical to think that any person has exactly the horoscope, the SAME future as I do simply because of the positions of any celestial object based on time and place of our respective births. What evidence do you have that a horoscope MEANS anything? If you DO have evidence, or even KNOW of anyone who does, then you need to go to <a href="http://www.randi.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.randi.org</a> and apply for the million dollar prize James Randi is offering for proof. You TOO, could be a million dollars richer! Just show some proof that a horoscope WORKS, or anything supernatural or paranormal exists, or any prediction of the future works as advertised, that prayer works instead of being a total abysmal failure. It is easy, If this stuff WORKS, then you should be able to provide some form of proof under scrutiny to an outside unbiased observer. That said, I was in a relationship with a woman a while back, who did NOTHING without consulting her astrologer. She dumped ME after a few months because her astrologer told her we had incompatible horoscopes! That our horoscopes diverged and would bring disaster to her life. Really, in my opinion, I think her astrologer was pissed off that I was not paying for advice and is/was a non-believer...|`|ecUnJOVYaa	lol yeah everytime i go on, it turned into a habit now<br>  and its usually true most of the times =)|`|71nFkYvbaa	no|`|elVDYy7eaa	No.|`|gspTDufpaa	No only about twice a week.|`|4UeOIGuhaa	No|`|Z3Mv1pxaaa	yes|`|tc5XLjUEaa	I find that horoscopes can pretty much relate to anybody no matter what zodiac sign you are.

ZCiOWObaaa	Skeeter Davis<br>  <br>  :editing::<br>  {to explain this answer}<br>  Skeeter Davis released an album titled "Here's The Answer"<br>  which included all those answer songs; and, her name is a<br>  version of the word mosquito which some call bloodsuckers.|`|wA8Dyhq7aa	Skeeter Davis did "I Can't Help You (I'm Falling Too);" however, Jeannie Black did "He'll Have to Stay," not Skeeter Davis.  And Davis' song "Last Date" was technically not an answer wong because the Floyd Cramer song was an instrumental, so my guess on that question is Conway Twitty, who put out "(Lost Her Love on Our) Last Date" some 14 years after the Skeeter Davis song.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Thanks, Nia.  I shouldn't try to change the clocks, play trivia, record a record to my iPod, and answer a question simultaneously.  Guess it's back to school to learn how to walk and chew gum simultanously!  LOL|`|58UB5lqRaa	Not sure of your question . but Jim Reeves sang He.ll Have To Go,<br>  Last Date was originally Floyd Cramer, how ever Emmy Lou Harris brought out a vocal version of it not long after in the 60,s<br>  Please Help Me Im falling is Hank Lochlin and  Emmy Lou does a slower version of it .

4Zj9eYgPaa	There is, but if you want to watch it just for the romance then I would recommend you anime like Romeo x Juliet, Clannad, Kanon, Air or the likes, because Basilisk is mainly made of gore, fighting scenes, some sex scenes (even though you can't actually see them like in a hentai), drama and weird characters with weird powers. On the other hand, if you like ninja and gore anime, then you should watch it.|`|xpowJMNTaa	yes, it is somewhat of a tragedy, it has a lot of ecchi moments including sexual references. But it terms of a concrete romance line, its more of a secondary attribute after action, yet it all comes together at the end. If you don't mind sad/bittersweet romance then go for it.

5MLTXctlaa	There are many types of music now.  No, they don't use voice effects sometimes.  It all really depends.  If you were to listen to a pop song, you might hear voice effects.  If you wanted to hear a rock song, that might have voice effects.  Like I said, it all depends.  <br>         If you want to hear a piano song, it could be slow, or up tempo and there are plenty of piano and violin and sax (you get my point) songs out there.<br>         People make music with a lot of guitar nowadays.  Or at least teens do.  But there are still a lot of nice, peaceful songs out there. <br>         Music hasn't really changed.  The only thing that's different is there's just more choices now for music.

Let's take this step by step: <br>  <br>  Tupac= Greatest to ever do it (My Opinion). Now you say that he only had one good album. I have I disagree with you on that one. He had several good albums. Me Against The World, All Eyez on Me, Strictly for My N's etc for me are great albums. Tupac's word play, storytelling, metaphorical sense etc just puts him above the rest.<br>  <br>  Lil Wayne= I have to agree with you on that one. The only song I really got into by Wayne was Hustler's Musik and Tie My hands. <br>  <br>  Biggie= A Great that deserves all the credit in the world. I mean c'mon did you not listen to that ready to die album? His best album. I'm not a real big stan of Biggie but he isn't overrated <br>  <br>  Eminem= Not Overrated. Eminem is the greatest white rapper. Infinite and Marshal Mathers Lp definately his best. His flow is just crazy. He has turned more mainstream over the years but you just cannot pass him off as overrated <br>  <br>  Jay-Z= Best Rapper Alive. I'm A Jay-Z stan. I love Jay-Z. He's the only consistent rapper these days. He stays on top of things. And not to mention his flow and lyricism is sick. And had several great albums: Reasonable Doubt, Blueprint 1 and 2, The Black Album and American Gangster. Yes he uses lyrics from other rappers because they are worthy from qouting from.<br>  <br>  Dr.Dre and Eazy e= Rappers I really never got into LOL. I've tried  many of times to get into them but I can't. So I really comment on whether they are overated or not. <br>  <br>  50 Cent= Fallen Off. Before blowing up 50 was a decent rapper. But the only song that really shows 50's true talent was Hustlers Ambition where he actually showed some lyrical stuff. But other than that I don't think he's overrated because he has fallen off  not alot of people think he good anymore. Many think he's whack so he's not overrated. He's just whack <br>  <br>  Lupe Fiasco= Underrated. He is an underrated artist. The Cool and Food and Liqoue were both great albums to me. He raps about different things. His flow is special, his delivery is special, and his lyrics are special. He doesn't get as much credit as he deserves<br>  <br>  Ludacris= IDk lol. I wanna say both. He's underrated b/c people really don't get to listen to his lyrical side. B/c that side is pretty sick. His commercial side is overrated.|`|CLB32006aa	Was there a question in any of this?|`|3oUSroiZaa	Dude are you serious all of tupac albums were great during the '90s.<br>  <br>  <br>  You must be a Soulja Boy Fan!<br>  <br>  <br>  Biggie is one of the best lyricist of all-time<br>  <br>  <br>  Eminem is a great lyricist also and I guess you've never listened to Marshall Mathers LP.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:IT'S SOULJA BOY FANS LIKE YOU WHO DON'T KNOW HOW TO LISTEN TO LYRICS.|`|mCoipTkbaa	ha! that list is wrong...tupac should be #1...<br>  and ur crazy lol|`|Da8WCIrjaa	OMG. You surely have NO taste in hip hop what so ever. If you think TUPAC was overated. Man he deserved every bit of respect he got from da game man, what you talkin bout. You betta check yo self.

tuATxHsVaa	[This is the CLASSICAL forum; however, I was appalled at the incorrect answers that people are throwing at you...]<br>  <br>  The smaller notes are what you play when you repeat the music. See the repeat sign? The small notes go with the lyrics that you sing on the second pass through, and the larger notes go with the lyrics that you sing the first time through. I.e. the syllables of the lyrics fall on the respective notes that you are hitting on each pass through the music.<br>  <br>  If you are simply playing this on piano (and not singing), then you play the big notes on the first time, and you play the smaller notes the second time. I think this answer is more obvious if you are singing the parts, because you'll realize that the words sync up with their respective notes.<br>  <br>  So, to recap, you don't play the little notes until the second time (when you repeat this section). It is simply a small change in the melody that corresponds with the new lyrics.<br>  <br>  The small notes are regular 16th notes, and you play them as written on the second pass.  First pass big, second pass small. <br>  <br>  Accidentals hold for the entire measure. A note that has been raised 1 step with a sharp or lowered one step with a flat remains that way until the measure is finished. Once that measure is done, all of the new notes are played according to the key signature once again.<br>  <br>  If you apply a sharp or flat to a note such as E, making Eb or E#, then the octaves of Es above and below that E are unaffected. They have to be sharped or flatted as well. Bare in mind, publishers can and will make mistakes, though. Strictly speaking, though, this is how it works in modern notation.<br>  <br>  So the answer is no, you should not play E sharp unless there is another sharp sign next to that E (on the octaves above or below). I would be wary of a publishing mistake, though, because most good publishers will put a natural sign next to that E on the octave above (just for clarity).<br>  <br>  Court Violinist<br>  <br>  *|`|CrAwmz65aa	Court Violinist is right.<br>  Give him 10 points.

Some of it is obviously natural talent. But you can do better by practice.<br>  <br>  Poll for guys:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ApjJ.iqsSOGetRkM_4rt3qfsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090306194025AAJXEcJ">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|Tb3hIDy8aa	Greeting singing hopeful-  I noticed that you have some questions about singing. Playing instruments does help you alot with singing, becuase you have to have good ears.  You have to know the theory of music, and how to read it. The good ear thing is the most important. You have to be able to hear if you are in tune, or out of tune.  Here is a method that will help increase your range, your ability to sing with style and variation, and help to sing clearly and strongly.  Speech Level Singing.  It works very well, and I recomend it highly.  Speech level singing helps cure vocal cord paralysis, and nodgules.  It also helps people without these conditions to prevent them.  SLS helps people learn how to sing, and become the best that they can! A lot of famous and non famous people use this technique because with it your voice will not come out, or be damaged.  It also helps you sing high and low notes with a connected voice, so it sounds pleasant to the ears.  Find a Speech Level Singing teacher near you, so that you can start now! For more information, go to sources! If that doesn't work, then I guess it comes natural to a lot of people.  On your vocal cords you have a skin coat layer simular to your skin.  It varies on thickness, and quality.  That is what makes you sound like you, and so on some people it naturally sounds better. It is highly recomended that you get a SLS teacher.  Go to my first source and go to find a teacher near you.  If you cant afford a teacher then, go to youtube and type in speech level singing.  There is a playlist of warmups someone put on there, and just try your best!  Any way, Good Luck! :)|`|O0b1wzpgaa	OK like some others singers they <br>  do play piano while singing it does helps<br>  <br>  here's my advice<br>  <br>  <br>  1.

The reason they are called auditions is because the people want to see if you have that it takes, so you want to do the VERY best that you can. So If were you, I would choose the less challenging song and add my own twist.<br>  <br>  But if you don't like that, then work on the other song, listen to it over an over again, play it 24-7 get the rhythm in you head until you cant get it out. Then practice and practice. First impressions is key in competitions. Good Luck on your audition|`|eLu3HKzaaa	It depends on what kind of instrument you are playing. After you let people know that you may be able to get more answers. I think you should play a song that is preety challenging and try not to make many mistakes...|`|u5J0pTOVaa	i think that you should try the hard song but don't make any mistakes work on them before it is time to perform|`|bY5Bjmhgaa	do the one that you think might be easy and may even give a challenge to others this can help you not only scare others but also pass the audition and get selected

zJoVm4SSaa	The movie did a really great job of staying true to the novel with the exception to the end! They completely changed the ending. Adrian wasn't using Dr. Manhattan to create the explosion, It was originally a squid. It still was an amazing movie. It does go into a little more detail especially with Adrian. you learn a lot more about him. I really think they did a good job as to keeping up with it. The beginning of the movie was amazing, how it showed all these little things that you knew what they were if you had read it. I wasn't disappointed and I'm a huge fan of the novel.<br>  <br>  <br>  No not too much was going on. You really have to read it but it did a great job of going in order and pretty much had everything in the novel with like i said the exception to the end. 9 out of 10. had it stayed true to the end then it def would have gotten a 10 in my book.|`|XJRYAhZVaa	Of course, it does. There was no way the movie could fit everything from the comic into an almost 3 hour long movie. Just impossible. <br>  <br>  I haven't seen the movie yet. Some fans of the comic love it while others hate it and others find it decent. To me, it really just depends on the person and how they compare the film to the book.
Qlb6QRi9aa	OMG i soo agree that was terrible what they did to that poor kid! I felt so bad for him and it was definitely humiliating.

XJRYAhZVaa	The counterculture movement of the 60's started in San Francisco in the Haight Ashbury district. The beatniks (the counterculture of the 50's) really started the whole "hippie" movement. The music and drugs (LSD and weed especially) all had a part in the beginning of the movement. The war in Vietnam also played a part in it. <br>  <br>  I started to fade because each decade something leaves and comes. That's life, things change. Though I am sure the end to the Vietnam War and the end of Nixon in office helped with hippies "fading." Though there are still many around who live their lives like hippies whether they consider it like that or not. I however disagree with you. I am sad that the movement faded....of course the drugs and free sex doesn't matter to me. I look at it deeper than that....<br>  <br>  And I find the music of the 60's and 70's better and have more depth than current music.|`|LT7q5ZZHaa	Bobby Dylan and very mellow rockers all sorta rebelled causing the controversy in the 60s. When the government fought back, they all were like "bring it" but when the 70s came they had all sorta grown up and little by little we only had memories. sucks that it had to fade, huh?|`|wDisAke1aa	The correct answer to this question is: Marijuana and LSD.<br>  <br>  <br>  Anyone who answers differently is wrong.|`|doVbqo3iaa	the beats aka the kings of all kings|`|oNAGWJudaa	the weeeed man!|`|8WBgLo1Caa	pot!!!!|`|3g3SCnDDaa	When one looks at the hippy movement, one must take into account the decade before the '60s. During the 1950's a circle of writers became well known for their alternative and "shocking" works. These writers were known as the Beats. This included poet Allen Ginsberg, writers Jack Kerouac and William Burroughs, as well as others such as Gregory Corso, Herbert Huncke, and Neal Cassady. There were others that are also well known, but these made up the forefront of the literary movement. These guys lived and interacted differently from the 1950's postwar culture at the time. They experimented with drugs, went on the road, explored different religions (notably Zen Buddhism), and lived alternatively to the society at large. This Beat "movement" is widely accepted as the precursor to the liberal flowering of the hippy movement, as well as the Free Speech movement in Berkeley and Folk Revival in Greenwhich Village in New York. This, coupled with a "nothing is impossible" philosophy helped to propel the hippy movement forward. The ideals of peace, love, and alternative living reached a climax in San Francisco in 1967, in what is now known as the Summer of Love. Many new rock bands formed in San Francisco during this time, such as: Jefferson Airplane, Big Brother & the Holding Company, and many others. Thousands of youth descended on the city, notably in the Haight-Ashbury district. By 1969, however, most people in the movement grew frustrated and dismayed with the resistance coming from the older generations, and the indifferent (or hostile, depending on who you talk to) responses from the government. Most turned to harder drugs such as heroin and speed, and developed addictions, making street life dangerous and drug dealing even more dangerous. The murders orchestrated by Charles Manson and his cult, as well as the riots at the Altamont Music Festival helped bring many people to the conclusion that the hippies were dangerous and hypocritical, and therefore grew more hostile towards the movement. The govenment crackdowns in Chicago in 1968 during the DNC also helped develope this feeling. However, the hippy movement lasted until the early to mid 1970's, but later faded away from the public eye shortly after the end of the Vietnam War. Hope this sheds some light on the subject. I would recommend you buy some books on the period. Peace!|`|f948d748facdf196074d849ea9c465c4aa	Hippies.|`|wIZNsqG1aa	It was a combination of things, mostly the unity of the age group that were in one against the war and also the anti establishment protest. The music was coming of age at the same time and there was a lot of talented artist that helped create the sound track for the era. The timing couldn't have been better for such a movement to take place it was almost like destiny.Many good things came out of that age but we also lost a great deal from it also, many lost their lives due to the drugs and riots but nothing comes without costs.|`|Wj7mBxFJaa	circumstance.<br>  <br>  a lot of things came together at the same time: the widespread use of marijuana, new styles of music pioneered by Bob Dylan and the Beatles, and the 1960's government and war that flew in the face of the new peace and love mentality that made the hippie movement move into the mainstream.|`|UFE7BJHBaa	Barry McGuire, with his "EvE of DesTruction " album .|`|noGTQvFYaa	hot hippies

9lVjWPGqaa	yes i do..<br>  <br>  <br>  edwardzslady duh<3|`|WpA7n8Iwaa	Yes - mainly in relationships.  That's why love songs are so strange.  They talk about all the rotten things that person did, and then ask them to come back.  That doesn't make any sense.<br>  <br>  I deal with it by staying by staying committed to moving on without them|`|VqAgZB0uaa	i have that issue and yeah its hard to deal with..but i just try my best to no think about that person and like get rid of the things that remind me of her...or i try focusing on the older better memories|`|PpWosZsIaa	Yes, Just it flow on out the brain|`|k6uSRCNbaa	Yeah, that's how I feel about my mom.|`|q95YF2Hhaa	id like to know|`|W8SgRKo7aa	hate them so muh u wanna pork em?|`|0l88fiUTaa	yes, that is how I feel right now about someone.....I just try not to think about him because I know I hate him(more like strongly dislike him) for a reason and getting back in touch with him is not an option......so I just live with these conflicting feelings, that drive me insane.....but when I'm busy or happy he is out of my thoughts...<br>  If you're trying to get over a person then only time can help you forget him/her....however if they haven't done anything bad to you and you still hate them and miss them when they're not around then it probably means that you secretly like him/her or like being around this person.|`|AA11989999	Yes, it's possible, but I think you'd admit it's a bit neurotic.

I just recently reached out to an ex-friend who had did me (I felt) so wrong and I called them up, talked cordial, and we meet for dinner. We hugged and kissed each other on the cheek and just expressed to each other how much we really missed each other. I feel very much at peace with myself because I know in my heart that I don't want to leave this world knowing that I had harsh feelings towards this individual. Every since then, we talk to each other on a regular basis. It's all about forgiveness.|`|0LSLXwWVaa	Hate is an extremely strong emotion. I think I couldn't hate anyone. But I dislike alot of my husbands family members, but I do miss them and I wish I were a big enough person to take the high road and tell them that I miss them and that I want us to start over. I just stay away from them and the few times they have reached out to me, I've been civil, cordial and I let them do most of the talking. Things just aren't the same. I think they will never get better.|`|85YtzzKraa	Yes! But then I don't think that you hate that person! You probably dislike them! Do something that you love to help distract you from that person!

Qk9NwiDaaa	I thought Kristen Stewart really looked the part but i dont think she acted out the part that well. I thought she had little emotion and her voice is a little too deep.. i thought she needed to be a little bit more feminine and happy... <br>  <br>  Rob Pattinson on the other hand was sexy! I thought he was cast really well!<br>  <br>  On a side note.. I think the actress that plays Rosalie is really pretty but I dont think she suited the part (looks wise) shes meant to have a swimsuit models figure and we assume shes means to have naturally blonde hair (eg: from when she was human) but you could tell it was dyed and she naturally has a more tanned complexion. I think the part for Rosalie needed to be more like an 'all American girl'. Blone hair, fairer complexion etc.|`|qzkWahFeaa	I thought she did good. I like her as an actress.|`|WqJk2yJiaa	i  think someone else could have done a better job. and about rob zac effron tried out for the part of Edward so who would you chose. and apparently they picked Kristen first and then picked the guy w/ the best chemistry w/ her. they did look uncomfortable too but when you think about it at first (in the book) it was uncomfortable but in the movie they dragged it out a lot more than it needed to be.|`|h4UzjZVnaa	I thought she was an OK Bella, but she didn't show how much she loved Edward.. Rob on the other hand.. I LOVED him as Edward. He's delicious.|`|s5qR22UKaa	Kristen was a raging WHORE! Oh god, I can't even begin to describe how dull she was, I HATE HER.|`|uOTD3qwZaa	I love Kristen Stewart as an actress, she is amazing in most movies I've seen her in, yet in this movie see seemed a little missed cast at points. Kristen seems like the horror movie type actress like she was in "The Messengers". Kristen had the whole awkward, modest, interesting in a werid, yet loving way down, yet I didn't think see committed to the falling head over heals for Edward(Robert) as it made out to be in the book. Also we have to keep in mind many good and important seens from the book wasn't brought into the movie. I personally, loved Robert as Edward, I could picture him as Edward Cullen after I read the book. He had the whole, stalker, loving, doing anything to keep Bella safe acting down! I loved every minute. Kristen didn't seem as committed to the part as Robert with the whole loving, dating thing. To me she just appeared akward or embarrassed to be kissing him and all. I agree Robert Pattinson looked amazing as Edward Cullen, by that I mean he completely fitted the part. The angelic face and then bronzed hair, I read the book after the movie and I thought they couldn't of cast Edward Cullen better. Out of the Twilight series for the movies, I'm very interested in seeing where the new directors take New Moon, even more so excited to see Kristen Stewarts reaction, when Edward decides to leave with his family in the Twilight Sequel. I'm very interested in seeing her crying and being full of sad emotions, for Kristen Stewart, I cannot see her acting sad and remorseful. I'm so excited for the sequel!!<br>  <br>  I hope you like my opinion(:<br>  <br>  Team Edward(:|`|joem8hQeaa	She was kinda dull. Like in the book she was absolutley infatuated with Edward and in the movie she seemed like she is really bored of him. Also it's like she doesn't need Edward, she didn't act vulnerable and in the book that is what originally alerts Edward to her because he feels the need to protect her (apart from her scent :) I think the casting directors could have gotten a much better Bella...and perhaps Edward, even though Rob was gorgeous lol. Even with Rosalie, she is supposed to be the most beautiful woman in the world! The actress who plays her, whilst pretty is dark skinned and dark haired and she looks so out of place and fake with the makeup and wig. The only ones I was really happy with were Alice and Jacob- Fantastic! I'm really looking forward to New Moon and to who they pick to play the Volturi(s).|`|0RinjMbJaa	kristen stewart had the look (normal/average) but she did seem bored with it and i didn't think her acting was as good as it could have been (the hospital scene was terribly unconvincing when he says she should go with her mom to jacksonville and then freaks out) but robert i thought was good he was supposed to look uncomfortable, remember he is desperately trying not to kill her. he is drawn to her blood more than any other humans. he even says "youre like a drug to me. youre my own personal brand of heroin." if you were to put heroin in front of an addict but he couldnt have it you can bet he would be a bit uncomfortable too.|`|IoDgOu4maa	I LOVE Twilight!<br>  Although I Think The Movie Was Not Very Good.<br>  I Pictured Things Diffrently At Times.<br>  But I Kinda Agree Ropatz Did Seem Uncomfortable,|`|piINwOSDaa	uhhhhh the movie wouldn't be the same if she wasn't that way and that the reason  why Edward couldnt read her because she was down to earth|`|VuzLDKrnaa	she's not that good of an actress, and she's not how i pictured Bella.
AA11230809	haha. well once i was at a store leaning on the clothing rack and the clothing rack fell on top of a woman. i was so mortified. but she wasnt hurt, thankfully.|`|Pv74tbyOaa	when i was younger i went on vacation to hawaii were me and my family went to a beach called big beach, anybody that has gone there can tell you the the currents are notorisously strong, but me not knowing went and immediatly jumped in of couse getting sucked out into the current, after tumbling me around the the surf i finally got spit back out on the beach i was so freaked out that i would get sucked back in that i grabbed the ankles of this couple making out on the beach, and the poor lady started screaming, needless to say i was extremely embarassed and now have a healthy respect for the ocean.<br>  also on another family vacation *sigh* while my brother was trying to learn how to snow board he lost controll and slid down the moutian taking out and entire group of skiiers + instructor at the bottom, also pretty hilarious althought the ski instructor didnt think so,lol|`|2g5W67Ueaa	I have one!<br>  Ok i was bowling with my friends.... and i was talking as i went up to grab my ball out of the holder thing. I was walking backwards as i was talking and triped over the end of the bowling ball holder..... I was laying flat on my face and i got up laughing moments later. Everyone was starring and laughing. Good thing i only got a bruise from that one :p|`|6JEhoZ08aa	I was walking along trying to be awesome, and went into a revolving door. Then, while looking down my nose like a snob, mis judged where the exit was and smoked my face into the round glass. This was on a busy road. People in cars laughed. I was so embarrased <br>  Lesson learned.

I saw A7X, Atreyu and Bullet For My Valentine live at Taste Of Chaos last year in Dayton, Ohio. Im telling ya, if you ever get a chance, go see them live if you haven't already. Their so different from a lot of bands. Atreyu..their ok dont get me wrong i mean..Becoming The Bull, Lead Sails Paper Anchors, Falling Down, good songs but..sound the same. A7X..they do all kinds of crazy things! They don't stick to one thing they look for other things. Like instrumental music and stuff like that. So..by far, A7X is a better band.|`|1haKToUeaa	Crap, these are both really awesome bands.  I guess if I had to say, Avenged Sevenfold had some really good stuff a few years ago and Atreyu has alot of good stuff throughout their career, but they kinda suck live.  I'd vote for Atreyu still|`|ZS38T8M7aa	Avenged Sevenfold.<br>  Definitely.|`|YPB7DXxkaa	A7X!

sCca9IApaa	Oro said Itachi > Him, and maybe if Itachi is weaker than Jiraiya, Orochimaru could lose. But sometimes it isn't A > B > C. I think Orochimaru is stronger, atleast with his immortality jutsu. It would be a great fight, though. Probably could go either way. But Itachi being cautious around Jiriaya and not Orochimaru is interesting.<br>  <br>  In an interview, Kishimoto said Manda is stronger than Gamabunta. But the Slug is stronger than the Snake. And Gamabunta is stronger than the Slug. So atleast the animals all have checks.|`|ptPazvB8aa	their about equal strengthened. i think if there was a full out fight, orocji would have the upper hand with all those forrbidden justsues he has, but jeriah would soon find a weakness and win. <br>  <br>  i wont tell you wat happens to them in shippuden( youll have to read the manga ) cus i dont want to spoil it if you dint already know, but i think you should read the manga. thers a lot more to the story than you might think.|`|iacvdnYTaa	TOUGH ONE. In my opinion, "stronger" is a pretty subjective term. They're pretty even if it comes down to it though. I think in a face-off, Jiraiya would win because if he could protect Naruto from the clutches of the Akatsuki, Orochi being on of them in the past, then he could definitely defeat Orochi using his Sage technique. Also, Pain defeated Jiraiya but to me it seems like Pain's techniques could cream Orochi as well. So yeah...I'll stick with Jiraiya (then again, I'm bias because I really like him).<br>  GO PERVY SAGE!|`|REfvEVe8aa	i think orochi because of how many people he has killed so many people but i might be wrong because every thing can always change

HhCctLofaa	Here is my list of good manga to read where you can read at mangafox.com<br>  1. Love Monster<br>  If you're not for the smut thing then don't read about this one<br>  It has a fusion of smut, shojo, action, fantasy, and supernatural<br>  2. Chrono Crusade<br>  If you watched the anime it's equally good. It involves nuns, beautiful girls, fantasy, history, demons, action, comedy, romance<br>  3. Blue Ramun<br>  It has a very good plot and storyline but I favor the characters the best. Pretty good artwork. It is a fusion of fantasy, romance, action,  , <br>  4.Vampire Knight<br>  Beautiful artwork, beautiful charcters, great storyline, but I would also give those other manga a try too<br>  5. Fruits Basket<br>  A mixture of fantasy, school life, drama, cinderella, romance, comedy<br>  6. Ouran Host Club<br>  It has pretty funny charcters and goods artwork. It has a lot of shojo, comedy, fantasy, and it's like cinderella<br>  Hope you find something you like!|`|iacvdnYTaa	If you want comedy (the kind that will really make you laugh) and romance, go for Girl Got Game.<br>  <br>  It's about this girl who is forced to dress up and pretend to be a boy and live in a boy's dorm to fulfill her father's dream of playing basketball with the best. <br>  <br>  I'm not good with summaries, google it!|`|ModuhBDIaa	I have been reading and loving Gantz.  Warning it is definitely a +18 manga.  <br>  <br>  Gantz is about a game in which people have to kill or capture aliens and often a lot of people are killed in the process.  These people are forced to play just after they died.  If they survive hunting the aliens they can resume normal life until they are call on again.  They can earn points for the aliens they kill and it can be use to bring someone back or be free from the game.<br>  <br>  Great story/ well written, great action scenes/ great characters, and dark comedy moments

Ftkr9jqYaa	The girls in "Spirited Away" (2001) do not have particularly short hairstyles, although at least one has a ponytail (see <a href="http://www.artoki.co.uk/artwork/SpiritedShade.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.artoki.co.uk/artwork/Spirited...</a> ).  Likewise, Kiki, the girl in "Kiki's Delivery Service" (1989) has a rather long hairstyle (see <a href="http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://lustrousrealm.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/kikis-delivery-service.jpg&imgrefurl=http://lustrousrealm.wordpress.com/2008/04/30/kikis-delivery-service/%3Freferer%3Dsphere_related_content/&usg=__DpPa3heTooiPLuD8nlFLi5GyKzk=&h=243&w=400&sz=17&hl=en&start=10&um=1&tbnid=sgccbUj4vQ1anM:&tbnh=75&tbnw=124&prev=/images%3Fq%3Dkiki%2527s%2Bdelivery%2Bservice%26hl%3Den%26um%3D1" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=h...</a> ).<br>  <br>  "Howl's Moving Castle" (2004), which has less feminine themes, may have somewhat shorter hairstyles, such as Sophie's (see <a href="http://sophie-lou.tripod.com/howls_moving_castle/thumbnails/400x300/sophiecalcifer.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://sophie-lou.tripod.com/howls_movin...</a> ).  Although "Princess Mononoke" (1997) has bellicose themes, it does have some long hairdos, such as the forest spirit San (see <a href="http://images.elfwood.com/fanq/i/v/ivymedusa/princess_mononoke.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://images.elfwood.com/fanq/i/v/ivyme...</a> ).<br>  <br>  I could not find any quotes of Miyazaki regarding his opinion on hairstyles in anime.

0vm66wlcaa	Electric guitar<br>  and <br>  Multi track recording<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Les Paul did not "invent" the electric guitar, but he did make wonderful improvements to it.<br>  "[Les Paul] created "The Log," which was nothing more than a length of common 4" by 4" fence post with bridge, guitar neck, and pickup attached"|`|NC67WVlEaa	He didn't invent the electric guitar. That was Rickenbacker, I believe... Adolf Rickenbacher and his partner to be exact. He just made improvements upon the body of electric guitars.|`|gfmTgLDKaa	In a sense he sorta did, but not really. He was the first person to play and invent electro-magnetic pick-ups for the guitar.<br>  <br>  Electric guitars were originally designed by an assortment of luthiers, guitar makers, electronics enthusiasts, and instrument manufacturers. Guitar innovator Les Paul experimented with microphones attached to guitars.[2] Some of the earliest electric guitars adapted hollow bodied acoustic instruments and used tungsten pickups. This type of guitar was manufactured beginning in 1932 by Electro String Instrument Corporation in Los Santos under the direction of Adolph Rickenbacher and George Beauchamp. Their first design was built by Harry Watson, a craftsman who worked for the Electro String Company. This new guitar which the company called "Rickenbacker" would be the first of its kind.[3]|`|fzqMOD4Waa	No, the electric guitar was pioneered in the early 1930's by Rickenbacker.<br>  <br>  But Les Paul was an important pioneer in solid body electric guitars.<br>  <br>  But he did invent something just as or if not more important to music recording, the multi track recording.|`|UAHjJpC0aa	You have 3 good answers<br>  for future reference<br>  a quick wikipedia search will answer a LOT of your questions<br>  <br>  Les Paul<br>  <br>  a GREAT inventor<br>  that still plays regularly in the NY clubs<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Paul" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Paul</a>|`|VSYhHiOeaa	les paul was the first person to invent electro-magnetic pick-ups for the guitar, making it the electric guitar. so in a sense, yes, he did.

AA11402617	Those characters are called "Snorks" and they are from an animated series which ran on NBC from 1984 to 1986, and in syndication from 1987 to 1988.   <br>  <br>  They appeared in the Family Guy episode <br>  "Brian the Bachelor" <br>  Season 4 episode 7  <br>  Brian appears on the ABC reality show "The Bachelorette". Meanwhile, Chris makes friends with a talking pimple on his face|`|64491cf5ed73ad038115b2f4040d2213aa	It was in Brian the Bachelor  season 4, episode 7 where a sexually suggestive Snorks gag is seen after Chris spray-paints the mini-mart wall. <br>  <br>  you can see it here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDLDFT6KowY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDLDFT6Ko...</a>|`|d5GfhPM4aa	lmao they were the snorks i love that episode but idk which episode it was but it was one of the old episode but im not sure

v8bltq3kaa	I think it's round about chapter 47. The Anime is not finished yet. There might be a second season coming this April. I have started to upload chapter 100 on youtube if you want to watch it.|`|n2HDjZtraa	As you probably know, the anime is very different to the manga! Although, if you don`t want to read it from the start, then I can say that in the manga, there is no such thing as "Number 1 in the world" plot like the anime had. That`s the only difference between the mange and the anime, thus the anime had scenes the manga didn't, such as the last episodes and many others as well. <br>   <br>  The anime ends at chapter 48; Resolution. Its where Lala uses that thing to make everyone forget about here, only to end up failing, so everyone remembers her, thus making the manga continue... <br>   <br>  Link to chapter 48: <a href="http://www.mangafox.com/page/manga/read/380/to_love_ru/chapter.23999.048.0/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mangafox.com/page/manga/read/...</a> <br>   <br>  The manga starts from where the anime ended at the next chapter - chapter 49. I can say that it is very interesting if you start reading it, because there is many interesting things (not to say funny!) that happens later on the manga that the anime didn't have. <br>   <br>  Link to chapter 49: <a href="http://www.mangafox.com/page/manga/read/380/to_love_ru/chapter.24001.049.0/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mangafox.com/page/manga/read/...</a> <br>   <br>  Hope this helped. <br>   <br>  Edit: Don't  expect to get more answers, because you can't  compare the anime to Naruto, who we all know is known all around the world! That's about it.|`|9YGlNdLEaa	in adition to what is said above, chapter 48 of the manga is also similiar to episode 13 of the anime.<br>  <br>  except that Gid is alot meaner and violant in the anime than he is in the manga.

So, they are starting the series from that ep. <br>  I know it totally sucks. :(<br>  But, it looks like we are going to have to wait until they reach the episode that you need to watch. Although, some websites are somewhat up to date. Its the website I used, until I noticed that it to stopped putting up the episodes. There is only 220 episodes of Naruto until Naruto Shippuden comes. The website is only at episode 209.<br>   <br>  Hope that this cleared of some confusion. I really hope along side with you that they will hurry up.

Oe2c1ZGIaa	In 2006, Fear Factor faced tough competition with TV ratings champion, the Fox talent series American Idol on Tuesday nights, and once again the ratings still declined. Despite much publicity concerning an improved format and better stunts for Season Six, NBC put the struggling program on hiatus for the remainder of the season to make room for the sitcom Joey, which was removed from the NBC lineup a few weeks later. NBC then canceled Fear Factor in May. The network began airing the remainder of the season on June 13, 2006, with the remaining episodes to be burned throughout the summer. In 2004, Fear Factor became the first network reality show to be syndicated. Over its six seasons, Fear Factor earned NBC a reported $600 million in advertising revenue.<br>  <br>  So in other words, it got canceled because ratings kept dropping.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_Factor#Show_format" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_Factor...</a>|`|klcqgST9aa	Yeah, I liked it too. <br>  <br>  I think it's still on obscure satilite channels you only get if you have 7000 channels, but otherwise it must've just died out.|`|IsOp79iPaa	some old guy in a retirement home was watching the show and he had a heart attack when he watched it, true story lol|`|bY5Bjmhgaa	it did i loved it but it might be on channel usa on wednesdays or thursdays<br>  not sure|`|nY8BVJP2aa	i dunno!  i had kinda forgotten bout it.  i love joe rogan tho.  at least u can still see him on ufc fight nights, tho

There‘s nothing left, but we‘re unhurt. This must be a sign from God that we should meet and be friends and live together in peace for the rest of our days“.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Flattered, the man replies, “Oh yes, I agree with you completely, this must be a sign from God!“<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The woman continues, “And look at this, here‘s another miracle. My car is completely demolished but this bottle of wine didn‘t break. Surely God wants us to drink this wine and celebrate our good fortune.“ Then she hands the bottle to the man.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The man nods his head in agreement, opens it and drinks half the bottle and then hands it back to the woman. The woman takes the bottle and immediately puts the cap back on, and hands it back to the man.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The man asks, “Aren‘t you having any?“<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The woman replies, “No. I think I‘ll just wait for the police.... “<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Have a nice day! :)|`|Vfio3ABeaa	this one is kinda long, but it's really funny :]<br>  <br>  a genie granted a bear and a rabbit 3 wishes each.<br>  <br>  the bears first wish was that he was irrisistably good looking.<br>  <br>  the rabbits first wish was for a motorcycle.<br>  <br>  the bears second wish was that he had the best cave in the forest.<br>  <br>  the rabbits second wish was for a biker's helmet.<br>  <br>  the bears third wish was that there were no male bears in the forest.<br>  <br>  the rabbits third wish was that the bear was gay. then, the rabbit put his helmet on, jumped on his bike and rode away.|`|AA11905223	as opposed to a funny joke that does what?...|`|AcFBETxAaa	Cop pulls over man for speeding and asks for license.

You would have to be one connected<br>  to your local newspaper or local news TV team.<br>  <br>  3) A local radio station will sometime have a backstage pass<br>  of the concert and offer it as a promotional prize.<br>  Either you have to be the 7th or 10th caller.<br>  Or answer the right question on the air.<br>  Or hope that the entry form you filled out gets picked out<br>  in a drawing.<br>  <br>  Those are the ONLY WAY you will get a backstage pass.<br>  <br>  - - - - - - - - - - - - -|`|wqGVJmaTaa	Try Here: <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fhomepage.html&tag=tubeblog-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?i...</a> <br>  Or try searching ebay <br>  <a href="http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?type=1&campid=5336006644&toolid=10001&customid=" rel="nofollow">http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-...</a> <br>  Good Luck

Its just the truth|`|pmagt3dYaa	I think that people like you just drive me insane!<br>  When will you understand that "hit movies" doesn't mean "good movies"?<br>  The same with the actors and actress. <br>  And the thing that separate her from other "hit actors" is because she do at same time commercials movies, and indies or independent or experimental movies (like Dogville, Fur, The Hours, Margot at the Wedding, etc)<br>  She's great as an actress and YOU are proving that. Because you only see her characters, and that means that you believe what she wants you to believe. <br>  She's, in the real life, is sweet and shy, and you only has to look her interviews and appearances to see that. <br>  I really don't understand when people call her "Ice Queen". Here we have a "Goodwill Ambassador of UNIFEM Ice Queen", an Ice Queen who donates to the Children Hospitals of Australia, an Ice Queen who donates half million dollars to the Bushfire Appeal to YOUR AND HER country, an Ice Queen who is loved by her colleagues, sorry her Friends.<br>  <br>  I'm just tired of people like you, who don't know anything and just talk empty words. <br>  If you don't like her, good!, but just DON'T BLAME HER.<br>  <br>  And I'm not australian, I'm from Argentina.|`|y9N3DsKBaa	Wouldn't kick her out of bed for eating crackers.

I don't think she is ugly but she seems to have adopted an attitude just like him.|`|AA10382483	Actually, she was born in Hawaii so technically she isn't Australian.

The skits are bad (example:  lick for 10?????).    That one skit about choosing a tie?    this isn't even dry humor.  it's dumb humor.<br>  <br>  i've always thought conan was funny. even when he started, I always thought he was copying Letterman, but it was still funny.  I think he started to develop his own style and is not pretty ground in his own humor.  I loved his goodbye on NBC too.|`|6oYVJrJkaa	I think he's with the now.

p5ZJfiIaaa	I don't think he ever could really STOP. If he stopped for an extended period of time the urge to eat would probably overwhelm him so badly that he would reach a breaking point where he would not be able to resist killing humans.|`|624623cd2a8b6362d907567791d6afb3aa	well obviously he would just get really weak and go crazy and eventually get blood!!!!!!!!!!!!!! but i dont really care about him... JACOB IS MINE!|`|BvWy7iRHaa	hahahah idk he would prolly like kill random ppl before long. i guess it would be like us not eating or drinking. mayb he would die, who knows?|`|D0SK7Dlfaa	That did happen in New Moon. If you read it remember the part in the book when they were in the Volturi castle? <br>  <br>  SPOILER:<br>  Is it just me but in that part of the book, Edward's eyes were really dark and that amazed the Volturi of how he could still stand close to Bella without attacking her sooo...hypothetically, he would go out of control I guess.|`|uyfTeiyraa	He'd starve and go into a coma.<br>  Vampires can only absorb nutrients by drinking blood.<br>  Although, since he IS Edward Cullen, if he stopped drinking blood he'd probably stay alive with the power of his love for Bella or something sickening like that.

uDsXjzwjaa	No. I don't. According to Jon's rep Jon was just taking pictures with two fans and it turned into this big rumor. I think it was only a matter of time before these rumors came out about them. They are reality stars who are always in the spotlight so just like celebrities there are going to be ridiculous rumors spread out of something silly.|`|8HDCGe5uaa	I certainly hope it was not Jon.  But, if it was, he should be able to out and have a boys night out occassionally.  Even with a night out it should be done responsibly especially for someone in the public eye  Kate also should have a night out with some girls, dinner and a drink, but we do not see this family with any friends, whicdh concerns me  The kids absolutly have each other, but need social interacdtion with others to have a balanced life  Cara and Maddie ar old enough for sleepovers with other kids|`|ZqDvQprCaa	i dont think its true.<br>  that is him in the picture but it could just be two fans.<br>  untill i see pictures of him playing beer pong and making out with those girls then i will believe it!|`|osbS3KsNaa	i just asked this question!!! haha.<br>  i really hope it's not true.<br>  this really isn't an answer, just a hopefull NO =((((|`|lO2Nvj81aa	Back in early February (the 6th) Jon was at a bar in Huntingdon, PA, where his mother is currently living. After a short time a the bar, Jon went to a college party hosted by a Juniata College senior. He spent an hour and a half at the party then went back to the bar. There are pictures of Jon at the party and at the bar with fans.<br>  <br>  On another occasion, rumored to be Valentine's Day, Jon went to another bar and there are pictures of him with fans from this night as well. In total, there are six pictures of Jon with girls circulating the internet. He is completely hammered in at least two of the pictures and looks pink-cheeked in a couple of the others. In the last photo, taken from the Juniata College paper, he is holding a beer pong and posing with the party hostess.<br>  <br>  Rumors abound that Jon was seen making out with girls and dancing with them inappropriately. Do I believe THESE rumors? No. Do I believe Jon was out partying with college girls. Yes. Do I think that is right? No. He is 32, or nearly 32 years old. He is married and he has eight children. He does not belong out by himself partying with college girls. Does that mean he is guilty of cheating? NO. <br>  <br>  When analyzing the information that is available on the situation, you have to use your own judgement. Ya know? There's is usually some truth to any rumor and in this case the truth is that Jon has been hitting the bars as of late.<br>  <br>  An article appeared in the Altoona Mirror yesterday in which a spokesman for Juniata College confirms that Jon was in fact partying with students of the college and was in fact at the bar that is mentioned in the tabloids. The spokesman for Juniata College is about as legit as you can get for confirmation of Jon's actions (and the extent of those actions IMO).  That article appears here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.altoonamirror.com/page/conten..." rel="nofollow">http://www.altoonamirror.com/page/conten...</a><br>  <br>  There is a picture of Jon with Erin Albert, the hostess of the party, on the cover of Juniata College's newspaper, the Juniatian, and in that picture Jon and Erin are each holding beer pong balls.  Jon's is in his right hand, Erin's is in her left hand.  If you haven't see the picture I'm talking about, click on this link <a href="http://i42.tinypic.com/2my6pkw.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i42.tinypic.com/2my6pkw.jpg</a> then click the image to enlarge it and look closely at the picture of the college paper.  You can clearly see the pong ball in Jon's hand.

Soooo my guess is you... are either dressing in the morning or undressing for bed. Based on this extrapolation I would say this; One, you go to the bathroom for a nice morning piss or to brush your teeth. Two, you go to the kitchen to have breakfast. Or assuming your going to sleep, take a couple steps to the bed and sleep like a champ.<br>  <br>  But you might be talking about your sexuality... Absurd, i know, but some people refer to the process of being open about homosexual tendencies "coming out of the closet." I have yet to "come out of the closet" per say, but I don't know if there is a next step once you tell everybody. <br>  <br>  After you do that, I would be open and be yourself with everybody you come into contact with. It is much more natural and will make you feel good being honest with new people you meet (and so easy compared to telling people you knew before you came out). <br>  <br>  And if you want to experience what the "gay scene" is like go do that.

It was waaay too long, the pace was too slow, and way too much back story. I don't need to see Dr. Manhattan's blue penis every time I see him. I only remember one time in the movie where it was not gratuitous. I didn't need to see the rape scene. As I was leaving the theater I thought the movied could have been edited down to a tight 2:10 or so and have been a better movie. It seems like the director made the movie for himself, the graphic novel authors, and a few hardcore readers. It certainly wasn't made for mass distribution- and appeal! I'll bet the numbers for the weekend are going to be lower than expected or predicted. If so, serves them right.|`|aWEybdDFaa	It was the most stupid movie I've seen in the 33 years I'm living.

The journalist took another photo (thankfully.)|`|vryw9udtaa	um, yes, i do. until i realize that they are hurt, if they are. especially if it's one of my friends who trips, i laugh uncontrollably at them, and they laugh along. i like to laugh with people, not at them.|`|KTtLYrcZaa	yes lol.. it's funny except when someone gets seriously injured... i even laugh when i trip :)|`|uff3kOoFaa	lol i laugh when I trip!!! i do it all the time too!! lol|`|63dUOWFNaa	yep :p but sometime i try not to.|`|vKCS3AVLaa	yes LOL|`|pMVhxRpGaa	I can't help it... I burst out laughing :D|`|oBvFYIXJaa	yeah aha <br>  i cant help it :)
2guyJOWJaa	from my experience with my band, if we hear a good riff or beat that we come up with, we build off it, or if our singer (or any band member) comes up with some really deep lyrics, we try to match it with an equally energetic and deep insrumental part, but the real truth is you cant force out songs, good ones come naturally|`|whYPpRXRaa	usually whoever plays the instrument makes the part. Sometimes though like in my band anyone makes lyrics. Really anyone can if they know what they are doing|`|1mZjbvmwaa	Comes naturally sometimes, the band just gets inspired and maybe the guitarist or something will do the lyrics or the  bassist would do all the music. There's really no specific part....|`|aCrILRS9aa	it usually comes naturally by the onne playing or singing
6nMYb48maa	I have taken alot of s.hit for my tastes.the only embarressing times that come to mind are once I was in a coffee house with my friends, and I thought we where alone (sadly mistaken), so I sang "With A Little Help From My Friends" into a spoon. I did a nice dance on top of a chair, too. Then a man came out of nowhere and walked up to me and said "I liked your singing" then laughed.<br>  Then once I had headphones in listening to "Come Together" and I did a nice raunchy dance on a couch. All the while I was oblivious to my audience of a random middle-aged man. How nice. <br>  <br>  MQ: I have the "Romeo And Juliet" soundtrack on vinyl. Like the movie from 1968. It's wonderful. There's like one song on the entire album, and the rest is dialoge and....noises....<br>  <br>  MQ2: Some Nirvana songs. Actually, most of the Nirvana songs that I own.<br>  <br>  BQ: All the time :)<br>  <br>  BQ: I rarely go into Target, but I have. I love messing around in department stores.|`|wxpQzOGkaa	Im embarrassed my some of my past music taste<br>  I  liked rap when i was like 9<br>  whoops hahaha. Rap is crap though seriously<br>  <br>  MQ1: Both of my Black Eyed Peas Cd. It's hard to look like a liget metahead with those in there<br>  MQ2: Nope I dont have any like Screamo cd's haha<br>  BQ1: yup yup almost every day<br>  BQ2: Target cause i had been looking for Death Magnetic for a week straight and every day they were sold out.|`|SMVsmzi4aa	No, not really, but yeah i can see how it can happen.<br>  <br>  MQ:my cat-jack off jill<br>  MQ2:cannonball-breeders, i really don't understand what shes saying. XD<br>  BQ: by all nighter, what do u mean?<br>  BQ: yes I love target so much i gotta scream something very insulting at my little sister every time i go in. XD but yeah my mom complains about taking me and her places.|`|wO5FP6Mqaa	Well this one time I had to present an English project on the Greek God of Death.  So I thought it would be a great idea to play some good ol' death metal (At the Gates, Carcass, Napalm Death, Opeth) during my presentation in front of a class full of people who listen to the top 40 (there was one other kid in there who liked death metal).  Needless to say, it wasn't easy with everybody looking at me like I was possessed by Satan.  Still, I'm glad I did it :)|`|1mZjbvmwaa	No not really....<br>  <br>  MA:It would have to be Just Dance By that GAGA chik or whatever, it's so catchy<br>  <br>  MA2:The Garden Of Eden by Guns N' Roses is like a total WTF moment hahaha<br>  <br>  BA:Hell yesssss<br>  <br>  BA:WTH hahah actually today at Wal-Mart<br>  its a small world after alll! <----Oh wait, that would be my embarassment on my ipod..... lol|`|yQH4Fpoiaa	Oh yeah. I was jammin' out to WHAM! in my car once, and when I hit a red light, these people next to me gave me the WTF? look. Kind of awkward.<br>  <br>  MQ: WHAM! songs<br>  MQ2: ANY Cocteau Twins song. Nuff said<br>  <br>  BQ: Yeah!<br>  BQ2: Never screamed but I swore loudly when a huge bubble bath thing fell on my foot. Ouch.|`|valvULe3aa	No, I'm not embarrassed by my music taste.<br>  <br>  MQ: Cherry Pie by Warrant<br>  MQ2: Smells Like Teen Spirit by Nirvana <br>  BQ: Yes, a number of times.<br>  BQ: Yes, once. My sister and I walked into FYE once, and a cardboard cut-out of the Jonas Bros were standing there. <br>  <br>  Awesome questions! :)|`|8qSx7CKOaa	I don't believe my music is embarrassing otherwise I would not be listening to it. However, if my mom saw me listening to Hooker with a Penis by Tool (which is on my iTunes) I'd be in big ****.|`|r4xKaZ37aa	No, I am perfectly confident that I have good taste in music.<br>  <br>  MQ1: IDK<br>  MQ2: Not to me, I can always figure out what they are saying.<br>  BQ: Who hasn't<br>  BQ2: yes. I do it a lot it seems like. where I currently we seem to be having a surplus of a-holes.|`|7oC5tO9kaa	Yes I love Pearl Jam/Nirvana but I like Katy Perry<br>  MA-Hot N Cold-Katy Perry<br>  MA2-Even Flow-Pearl Jam<br>  BA-Yes...maybe 5 times<br>  BA2-Yeah I have paged people before|`|i5YJBqnZaa	MA: Madonna: What It Feels Like For A Girl<br>  M2: The Kingsmen: Louie Louie, As far as I know no one knows what the lyrics are to that song.<br>  BA: 1 about every other week<br>  BA:Department Store? No. Bank? Yes|`|K4Nt8kZPaa	No...well, I do listen to the Medic Droid. And a ton of pop music...I'm not embarrassed.<br>  <br>  Music is music.<br>  <br>  MQ2: Black and Blue by Bring Me the Horizon lol<br>  BQ: Sure<br>  BQ: yeah....a few days ago|`|o1BDgJQTaa	MQ: I like musicals. So that makes quite a few awkward songs for the casual iTunes skimmer.<br>  MQ2: I Am The Walrus- The Beatles, Mad As Rabbits- Panic At The Disco<br>  BQ: Yep<br>  BQ: Nah|`|QIhBRjW5aa	Yeah, sometimes. I usually don't bring my ipod to school because I don't want people saying "Who the hell is Meshuggah?"|`|Ahm3fSYlaa	mq acdc big balls<br>  mq2 no<br>  bq yes<br>  bq of course ive screamed in a target who hasnt|`|wOc4Dqllaa	Not really. I used to be, all of my friends pretty harshly look down on anything that's not played on the radio, but then I realized that it just doesn't matter!<br>  <br>  MQ: I've got three Britney Spears albums that I listen to semi-regularly, lol.<br>  <br>  MQ: I've never been able to understand Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun by Pink Floyd, other than the title line.<br>  <br>  BQ: Yes. I was working on an experimental rock adaptation of The Wizard Of Oz with a friend, and we stayed up all night eating waffles and Kool Aide, transcribing melodies.<br>  <br>  BQ: Yes! Regularly, lol. More yelled than screamed, but same concept.|`|rXlyHk1Raa	Yeah, some girl was looking through my iPod and saw "Let's Put the X In Sex", "(You Make Me) Rock Hard", and "Love Gun" by KISS. *sigh*<br>  <br>  MQ2: "Primal Concrete Sledge" - Pantera<br>  BQ: Yeah<br>  BQ: With Friends|`|YbmklSzGaa	No, I'm not embarrassed by my musical taste. If I like something, then I like it. I don't care if anybody knows. I'm actually quite proud of my musical diversity. I'm glad I'm not close-minded like so many people tend to be. Some people have tried to make fun or make me feel embarrassed of my music taste and I just brush it off. I love my music :D<br>  <br>  MA: None<br>  MA2: I'm sure I do, I can't think of one at the moment though.<br>  BA: Yes.<br>  BA: No, but I got kicked out of Toys R Us for jumping around on those big bouncy ball things all around the store.<br>  <br>  :D|`|ab1c9b81d36c3691f0d575d773009489aa	Nope.  <br>  <br>  MA: probably some of the cheesy 90s pop songs. Theres a few...<br>  MA2: I was going to say "Tourettes" lol<br>  <br>  BA: all the time<br>  BA:  Yes, haha.  Moreso in Wal-Mart though. My brother and I have gotten into all kinds of 'shenanigans' in Wal-mart lol  One time we walked around screaming some random name, like "Bob, where are you!", "Dammit Bob get back here!" lol  Another time we walked around and would say "Wassup Carl" to random people we passed.  They'd always look really confused lol  That was when we were younger though.|`|Yc9uPziVaa	The only thing embarassing is Weezer<br>  <br>  MQ: Pork n Beans - Weezer<br>  MQ2: Tourettes for me too. Oh and Loser by Beck.<br>  <br>  BQ: nope<br>  BQ: i haven't... on the other hand my mom has on several occasions... you dont farck with my mom...|`|82946bac5a72f2b8fbcdafb97f625641aa	Nope.<br>  <br>  MA: not one lol<br>  MA2: I have a lot of songs like that, but the band, Deicide in general has lyrics that ou cant understand most of the time.<br>  BA: Yep<br>  BA2: Nope XD|`|f948d748facdf196074d849ea9c465c4aa	Nah, most of my friends are not even into music so they are just impressed that i have heard of bands not on the top 40. They do tease me about my pickiness though. <br>  <br>  MQ-Rehab-Amy Winehouse<br>  MQ2-Yeah i love the song Tourettes but i cant understand what he is saying. Or of course Yellow Ledbetter but there are actually no official lyrics to it.<br>  BQ-no, the lateist ive ever stayed up is like 3:30.<br>  BQ-Im sure i have when i was like 5|`|Wj7mBxFJaa	Um im in general very proud of my ipod, i have a lot of great albums on there, but there are a few singles i have floating around that i wouldn't exactly be bragging about to my friends hahaha<br>  <br>  MQ: Probably the two Presidents of the United States of America albums i have.  and the Violent Femmes hahaha<br>  MQ2: i have a bunch of stuff i didn't understand for a long time until i listened to it a lot.  The Arctic Monkeys were like that, with that accent and how fast they sing.<br>  BQ: my record is about 38 hours awake.  for no good reason other than insomnia<br>  BQ2: um, no.  sorry|`|RtG5Iarbaa	MQ: If someone looked through my library they'd see my secret stash of Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears songs..<br>  MQ2: Not sure<br>  BQ: Yes, I did almost every week in the summer. Usually alone though, all my friends fall asleep before me except for one, but we were just IMing. xD<br>  BQ: There are no Targets in my country.<br>  But yes, in a drugstore.|`|vlIXsFmhaa	I take a lot of crap for listening to Slayer so if "GOD HATES US ALL!!!!! GOD HATES US ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!" came blaring out Id be a little embarassed.<br>  <br>  MQ2: The Closest may be Slaughtered by Pantera. But its still easy to understand<br>  BQ: Yes<br>  BQ: I dont think so. I was in target yesterday too.|`|9hFexadLaa	No<br>  <br>  MQ: Bitchslap by Slipknot<br>  MQ2: Mrs. Buttersworth by Nirvana<br>  BQ: almost<br>  BQ: Ya, one time when I went to Lowes one of my friends brought along his helmet he wore for wrestling and acted retarded the whole time. It was freaking hilarious.|`|Z8d9ipxmaa	MQ: I have a Britney Spears CD from when i was 10.<br>  MQ2: Yeah, tourettes, but i can decipher some of the lyrics; "may day every day... heart attack, my heart..." <br>  BQ: Yeah, i'm a night owl<br>  BQ2: Yeah, when i was 2 years old and i angry! lol <br>  =D|`|ssoZ33XIaa	I don't recall ever being embarrassed by my music taste.  After all, it's what I like, why be embarrassed?  I can see how it's possible, but not an experience I've had.  I remember back in the Discman days having a disagreement with a friend on the bus about how he liked none of my CDs, with the exception of Britney Spears.  Never embarrassed me though.<br>  <br>  MA: hmm... I do have the song from the Zenon movie, one of those Disney Channel original movies in the late 90's.  I do like the song though, I'm not particularly embarrassed by it.  I think it's called Supernova Girl or something like that.<br>  <br>  MA2: I download a free song somewhere that's in Finnish (I think) and therefore completely indecipherable to me.  I can't remember the name of the band at the moment.<br>  <br>  BA: More times than I would like to remember.  <br>  <br>  BA2: Not that I recall, no.|`|vvbhO88maa	I don't think so. Maybe when I was in second grade and my teacher asked the class what was our favorite music. I replied with The Beatles and everyone laughed at me. That just sucked. Then she asked me what else I listened to and I told her Queen and Led Zeppelin, then she said I was cool. She had no idea how wrong she was. :) Other than that nine years ago, no.<br>  <br>  I've got the Barney's Great Adventure Soundtrack CD and it's on my WMP, so that might embarrass me for a few seconds. Then I wouldn't care because the old Barney episodes and that movie were all great. <br>  <br>  I don't think so.<br>  <br>  Yeah, I am now.<br>  <br>  Yes, It's the only way to get my mom to leave stores sometimes.
8XT1Tvcvaa	Trainspotting is just one of my favourite movies period, so I'll go with that. It's moving but in a more disturbing kind of way. Probably the best film about drug addiction. (ya, better than Requiem for a Dream)|`|q4XUy0Duaa	I'ma definitely check it out!<br>  <br>  Braveheart<br>  I can relate to a lot of what went on in that movie.  I didn't personally rally a small army against an evil empire who persecuted my people, but I lost a lot of my family in something similar that happened only a decade and a half ago.  We eventually gained our freedom and independence as a nation, even though there is still a puppet government over there.<br>  <br>  RHH: Invetro|`|os6FaEBlaa	I got to watch that later today, well a good movie that got me was Once, the movie was okay with the acting but the music was what really did it, and another one is Phenomenon because of how the gift of knowledge he gets isn't really a gift in the end.<br>  <br>  <br>  RHH: My favorites are Fudge Pudge, Walking Into The Sun, and Stray Bullet.|`|okECVBkzaa	Defiance<br>  <br>  RHH - Stress|`|hfxRFSM4aa	that movie kinda reminds me of dangerous minds|`|OGNBOaKyaa	I agree!<br>  Crash...one of my all time favorites!

They put so much passion and heart into every one of their songs that its not fair by cutting down the rest of their songs due to labeling one of them as, "the best." They are truly amazing artists. Even when they are credited as one of the most influential bands of the 90's and sold over 50 million albums worldwide, they turn away as they don't want to conform. Kurt Cobain once said, "We're so trendy we can't even escape ourselves." Nirvana is the opposite of trend, in fact they made their own genre (grunge). How can you say what's the best song by this inspiring band? They are the creators of all the new harder rock bands we see today (the emo/screamo genre has Nirvana to credit). Everything Nirvana has done musically is full of energy, spirit, passion and originality. Its so sad that Cobain's depression caught up with him.

Friends are there all the time, good or bad. They offer you a shoulder to lean on or cry on if need be, they will listen to you or just let you talk. Even if there is something going on in their life, they still take the time for you and expect nothing in return.

EuwjIJ3Zaa	I will probably catch mass heat over this answer...<br>  <br>  But, I believe so, absolutely.  Especially from Eastern Astrologers.  Respect of the 'guru' is kind of implanted in their culture, and their more prone towards dogmatic, and possibly draconian ideals and interpretations, especially with views from traditionally malefic planets.<br>  <br>  Truly, it's a cultural ideal, to be a guru, or to respect a guru in many eastern societies, so some practicing astrologers there, especially in remote rural villages, may be unintentionally brainwashing their 'students'.<br>  <br>  Astrology has endless duality, and often it's horribly misinterpreted when people try too hard to pin down a correct answer.  The holisitc approach is often overlooked, I guess, as well as the importance of proper education. Education, Education, Education.  Experience is kind of limited in it's interpretation without it.|`|HSSuKNCUaa	I am really tired of people trivializing Hitler on Yahoo!Answers like he's a decent example for any group of people or any ideology.<br>  <br>  NEWSFLASH! Hitler was a mental f___ck up.

Why don't you also bring up Mao and Stalin next time you try to sound like an expert on mass murdering history and comparing normal, harmless people to them?<br>  <br>  You can't use the word "Hitler" like a magic word for everything you do not enjoy or appreciate, it is insulting to what happened in World War II and it is incredibly short sighted and easy. I'm sorry but someone needs to tell you up front because you are trivializing a psychopath.|`|531f08d2bae7afb19dbace61520eb62caa	Look for evidence that astrology is valid. This should be easy since it is so wonderful and powerful. One the things astrologer like to do is after the fact comparisons with the famous and infamous.<br>  <br>  There are many that claim to have studied astrology. Nothing is ever found to be wrong. These people always seem to find as they study, better and better things about it. But even though they have the same access to statistics as anyone, nothing is ever found to be wrong. So it must be the next best thing to perfect, in their view. The stereotyping must be spot on. Not one astrologer is going to admit there are any flaws. If they did, what can they do? Make changes? Change one thing and then everything must be changed.<br>  <br>  This will never happen. Perfection is a man made conception. Astrology must be the closest thing to perfection.<br>  <br>  Edit: I do expect TDs for this. But if astrology is not perfect and does have flaws, what are they?  Why don't they get addressed and what will be the backlash if they did?|`|MJ5juxzpaa	bigfoot|`|32P3hG0Laa	Hitler was a vegetarian, too. Does that make vegetarians dangerous? Your logic is skewed<br>  <br>  Of course some astrologers have some flaws. So do some doctors, some lawyers, some plumbers and some politicians. It's called being human.<br>  <br>  I am an astrologer. I try to give the best advice to my clients, based on their charts and desires. I also encourage them to make ther own choices, based on the information I give them. <br>  <br>  Like anyone being paid for advice (whether a financial expert, a psychologist, a lawyer), clients should still use their own wisdom to sort through the options and decide for themselves. <br>  <br>  Are some astrologers "mind control freaks?" Probably. So are some psychologists, some preachers, some spouses and some best friends.<br>  <br>  Why are you singling out astrologers?<br>  <br>  No one, and I mean no one, should be followed blindly.|`|izX7ymibaa	Most astrologers I know are very spiritual tree hugging types. I, myself, study astrology and I am not dangerous, or a cult member. I'm not a joiner. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry about Hitler, he borrowed from all kinds of religions, like the swastika is a buddhist symbol of eternal life and love; it didn't work for him. He'd try anything that he thought would give him more power. I also heard that he blindly followed his "spiritual advisors", so much so that he got conned by the British who planted an astrologer double agent, who told him certain dates and times would be auspicious for some thing he was doing, and he was being set up. Which I think is pretty funny.

8563099a1dde3cb3254ad0e9f0ba8ad0aa	All movies are five day rentals the way the late fee works is it re rents you the movie for 5 days so as long as you bring it back by tuesday you only will pay for one rental cycle.  4.79 is the cost of a new release before tax, so if you live ina 5% sales tax area, thats 5.03 (which is like the most annoying thing in the world when someone has no change)  older movies are 2.99 thus 3.14 with sales tax. Blue rays are 6.08 with tax i believe 5.79 or something like that, so if you have not returned it yet, keep it a few more days.  Games how ever are by the day usually around 1.50

BlZ6vJOAaa	If you mean that you cheated , then you can apologize but it is almost impossible to regain their trust.<br>  We are very jealous ,resentful and possesive. I personally would never forget it.<br>  Just be honest go right out and cry, since emotional displays don't really bother us when it comes to love.<br>  say everything that comes to mind he wouldn't hold it against you.<br>  if he is a true taurus.<br>  edit---<br>  So lets say you rejected him.. it never hurts to apologize, and however he takes it m at least you did. He will forget at some point but if he had it in his mind that you should be his girl . its kind of hard to deal that he can't have you.<br>  especially for a taurus, especially when we like/love someone|`|DoHaUEziaa	The same way you would apologize to anyone. Betrayal in regards to anyone is still betrayal. Hard to forgive a betraying lover. Even if they do forgive; they will never forget.

But it really is a crappy car.<br>  <br>  Well, it depends. If your Taurus has his mind made up, forget it. You'll never get him to forgive you. My advice is to be really sweet, bring him a stuffed animal, and try to make him laugh. Feeding him chocolate is not a bad idea either. : )<br>  <br>  roflmao at monty python... fetal position >.<

KOF2lcydaa	1. I saw it.<br>  2. It was good but not great.<br>  3. Yes, I read the comic.<br>  4. I was irked by the omission of Bernie the news vendor, and all the other minor characters. It was their dread of the approaching nuclear war that gave the story a sense of urgency. All these characters are killed by Viedt's attack on New York. Seeing familiar characters killed made the reader confront the inhumanity of Viedt's plan to save the world. It made you feel what it would really be like to kill half of New York. <br>  <br>  In the Movie, Viedt destroys several cites, but the audience only sees it from a distance. The destruction is only spectacle. There is no sense of horror and loss like there is in Alan Moore's graphic novel. <br>  <br>  In the graphic novel, the heroes are faced with a terrible moral dilemma about what to do with Viedt. In the movie, his crimes are only academic. The movie audience is never confronted with the terrible scope of Viedt's moral arithmetic.<br>  <br>  I could easily stand the change from fake alien attack to a berserk Dr. Manhattan, if only the director made us feel the death of half of New York in a meaningful way. <br>  <br>  Bernie the news vendor only appears at the end. The audience never gets a chance to understand why he attempts to shield a boy from the blast with his own body. In the graphic novel, it was a moving act of noble futility. <br>  <br>  As usual, the book is much better than movie.|`|ViwZCW7paa	Yes I did. I had low expectations for it because of the ratings, but I thought it was a kind of unique movie that some people would think is completely trashy and others interesting and appealing. I myself saw that uniqueness and found myself liking the characters, and the movie despite the drawn out gore, nudity, and annoying long songs. I looked at it, but didn't read it my friend did however and she really loved it and thought it was a good representation and when i went home looking back at the novel i could remember the movie scenes and how remarkably precise it was.|`|OAzJPUkHaa	1)Yes<br>  2)Loved it<br>  3)Several times<br>  4)Only a few things:<br>  <br>  1)Rorschach's reunion with Dan and Laurie.  I wished they'd kept it more true to the book.<br>  2)The big Hollis Mason thing(not saying it, but you should know what I'm talking about) being taken out, but that's in the directors cut.<br>  3)Dan's concern about Rorschach(when he says "Him coming to me makes me think he wants to be friends but doesn't know how" stuff like that).<br>  4)Leaving out some of the minor characters.  Joey, the two Bernies, etc.<br>   <br>  Overall, I enjoyed the film and will buy the Ultimate Cut when it comes out on DVD.  After reading some of the IMDB reviews from long time fans, I was a bit worried.  That stopped after the opening credits.  I just think it's a movie that divides people, either you enjoy it or not.|`|9RPqWxuhaa	1) not yet<br>  2) idk<br>  3) yes, love it<br>  4) idk<br>  <br>  so far wat ive heard from my friends (who've all read the book) that it was amazing, and i was wondering if it was rly that good, cuz the book was obviously excellent|`|R0cxoUkDaa	1) i did see watchmen<br>  2) I liked it alot, minus blue glowing penis<br>  3) no i have not read it<br>  4) i would not know|`|AA12152082	Yea I saw it, Yea I liked it and I yea I read the comic before. <br>  <br>  Honestly its been a while since I read the comic, maybe a few years, but I still really enjoyed the movie, and I remembered the majority of it, and was pleased with how it translated on the screen. <br>  <br>  One of the better novel to screen adaptations!|`|xxSGhywoaa	I did<br>  It was good<br>  YEs<br>  No not really.

26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	No it's not. Vampires have entertained people for hundreds of years so there are bound to be various spins.

There are many coincidences, yes, but I think the Twilight books are unique, and that there is not too much of a resemblance when you compare them. There is no for sure way to know unless we talked to the Writers of Moonlight, but from my own assumptions, opinions, and mini bit or research, my final answer would be no. Hope this helps!!|`|R4jDg5Ksaa	I think it has a few coincidences but what do you expect - it happens.  As far as I know however it was not based off it at all. I'm sad they cancelled that show after only one season it was very good.|`|dMBSE8ilaa	No, Twilight came before Moonlight was shown. Not everything with vampires is connected, you know.|`|avlVHXDCaa	Umm noo|`|b02d3b9f4bdf98dd840dd4a2ae496f5daa	No, the show moonlight was not based on the Twilight series.  The show was originally going to be called Twilight when the pilot was wrote for the TV show but the ended up calling it Moonlight.  <br>  <br>  The Twilight author began writing the book series in 2003.  The writer for Moonlight created the Mick character in 2004 and wrote a book about it.  It was pitched to WB studio's who paired the author with someone to create the TV Show.|`|pYpXj7gOaa	noo its not. moonlight featuring Alex O'laughlin was canceled early 2008. it is in no way affiliated with Twilight. Yes there are similarities but it is not based on the film.|`|jtVVuG6Zaa	Im not sure but let me know when you do. I really like twilight but i dont think it was. im pretty sure it came out after the book but not before the movie|`|V1uWwwF7aa	No its not.

ebb4b810f34245706f791aeb50bec63aaa	Rabbit stated that both he and Owl were "real animals".  I can't remember which cartoon it was but in one of them he told Owl "You and I have brains. The others have fluff".<br>  <br>  Gopher wasn't featured in the books and was added to the Disney franchise which would likely indicate that he wasn't one of Christopher Milne's stuffed animals and was probably based on a real animal instead.  Lumpy was also created by Disney but I think they made him a stuffed animal instead because Heffalumps were included in the original books.|`|AA10182088	sorry, but I don't like winnie and I'm having a real issue with his friends...<br>  I have a problem with a boy bear that wears no pants playing in the woods with a little boy name Christopher, a tiger that's on crack, a donkey that's on Lithium and a baby pig that could just be suffering tri-gender issues. but the no pants thing is what gave me nightmares as a child|`|UZ8wsmuFaa	Yes they are real animals that Chritopher Robin has included in his fantasy world, where his stuffed toys can walk and talk.|`|PREUMGZiaa	lol real original names for the last 3. no, their not real. their fictional characters.|`|0ece3ea96233735c56393ae48382a64caa	...Must you make me think this hard so late?|`|pdsvVUfDaa	ahh yes the questions that keep me up at night...|`|73c08aa590c890d1f54b22d1db2cef60aa	I never thought about it.

2637c00675fe234e63896e77bdfcccbfaa	in X-men Origins: Wolverine, they are brothers. but in the first X-Men , they are not related. and if they were still portrayed as brothers in the first X-Men, wolverine wouldn't recognize him because when he was shot in the head at the end, he lost all his memories (ex: he couldn't remember who gambit was).|`|Klb4ZYcVaa	In the animated series & comics, they were always rivals, & brothers.|`|axCFlk5Zaa	These movies don't follow the actual storyline. I am so tired of these comic movies coming out ruining the actual lore of these comics. <br>  <br>  The new X Men movie in my opinion was just an excuse to put Hugh Jackman in some CGI action scenes for a bunch of girls. I don't consider it worthy of an X Men title.

It refers to a psychiatric condition that renders the "victim" legally incompetent. "Crazy" is just a regular old term for a person with a psychiatric disorder, or a person who is irregular, erratic or "nutty."|`|kTc3bfrRaa	crazy..  you dress  in  a  bunny suit ..in  public.!.<br>  <br>  <br>  insane  you  dress in  a  bunny  suit..  but  carry  an  ax !

OIRnaRxfaa	My personal opinion is you are right there are some great sports outside that the kids aren't playing that you can interact in easily since you are familiar with the interaction level, but maybe some multiple player games  that are targeted for family (most of wii games for example) and can cause interaction with your kids, and maybe some of the motion technology can cause some health improvement (see <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/health/2008/12/24/2008-12-24_wii_is_overwhelming_aching_parents.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/hea...</a> ).  Of course, that doesn't mean they shouldn't go out, because sports are a great experiences for children especially baseball and basketball.|`|fQsbcRtVaa	being to tough my son have a tv and video games in his room but theres a time for it and he knows that

JGrpDLKcaa	CSI teams also aren't usually led by single-minded masters of spitting one-liners, with polarized sunglasses of justice, who when enter a crime scene, remove the glasses, crouch to the ground and address the team and/or witnesses with a cock of the head and a growled pun on the situation.<br>  <br>  It's TV... mind off, entertainment on.|`|ZYwTrAp8aa	CSI is cool.  Sarah Connor didnt grow on people.  and...  who really knows why decisions are made.<br>  lol...<br>  I miss Northern Exposure|`|a231cd46589d3ea6efabcc68cdd6e69baa	It all comes down to ratings.  CSI averages between 20 and 30 million viewers per week.  Sarah Connor Chronicles averages around 4 million viewers per week.  Don't blame the industry, blame the millions of people who choose to watch CSI and not to watch Sarah Connor Chronicles.

BVf2eAWnaa	Ghibli/Miyazaki is the best I know of too :)<br>  <br>  Movies I like is Princess Arete, which is a fantastic fantasy.<br>  Oseam is also really good, it's about two orphan siblings that gets taken in by munks in a monestary.<br>  <br>  Miyako from ef-a tale of memories had divorced parents, but there was only a small part near the end that was about that (maybe episode 11). Sorry, this is the only one I could think of.  <br>  <br>  For movies Makoto Shinkai. I really liked "The place promised in our early days", "Voices of a distant star" and "5 Centimeters per Second". All three have a melancholic feeling to them, how time passes and people slip away from each other (how things change)<br>  <br>  Millennium Actress is good but I don't know if it's your taste.<br>  <br>  I hope that helped you a little bit at least. And I hope it works out with your parents!
56bNLJykaa	No not at all.. But then again, Ordinary People won over Raging Bull.. Rocky won over Taxi Driver.. Whatever, I know more about movies than some of the members on the academy voting board- and I wouldn;t doubt that for a second. But it did help that the American films that came out this year were for the most part, garbage. Also whats funny is that City of God (cidade de deus) which was 2 times the movie didn't win any awards because it is "foreign," yet Slumdog and City of God were very similar.|`|hU0Wu98kaa	Yes, most definatley! Ya its your typically romance, underdog story, but there is a very serious underlying theme; poverty around the world.  It is very eye opening and deep. Slumdog Millionare is an instant classic! Loved it!|`|5U1TTI7Taa	no. it's a good movie, but it is not best picture. it's totally unremarkable. i expected it to win, i just really don't get the buzz surrounding it.<br>  <br>  the only thing that made me really upset was that it won best cinematography over the dark knight. seriously? i'm not even that huge of a fan of the dark knight but the cinematography was better and took a lot more effort than any scene in slumdog millionaire.|`|rSq790ksaa	No, I agree with you. Once on person says it's good, it travels around and then people looking at you like you're crazy if you haven't see it or enjoyed it.|`|V1hxvQukaa	i thought so. i really liked it. <br>  <br>  i saw all 5 of the movies nominated for best picture at once (it took 13 hours) and slumdog was my favorite out of all of them.|`|6EQJPxfjaa	No movie over rated...absolutely.|`|34ce47ef4257a97bb2cddf865a958fa8aa	I have problem with Slumdog being awarded the best adapted screenplay. Curious Case should have won. Adapting a short story that is more than 80 years old, that's not easy.<br>  Cinematography award should have been won by  the dark knight
0g4ZsFfiaa	it's actually very nice.. i like the chorus especially.. it's deep and meaningful.<br>  well done :)<br>  <br>  oh and i disagree with who said that u don't run away towards something... what i would say about this part is "bravo" really.. this is what song writing is mainly about.. playing with words and mixing them.. not showing the real meaning at times and being absolutely honest at other times.. and it IS correct... for you run away - from something - towards another thing.. it's not grammar for cryin out loud it's a song!<br>  <br>  again.. well done u do have true talent and potentials... what you don't want to do though is just stick to this level... u should and u CAN build on this to come up with even more beautiful ones..  :)|`|0C15BUMCaa	I like the lyrics, and like the singing, maybe just work on the tune a little more..and just a side note..<br>  <br>  You wouldn't 'run away towards' <br>  <br>  you would run away from....would sound much better.<br>  <br>  Don't let all these other people talk shi* to you either about this, keep it up.|`|0Ba8wYcSaa	Well. The lyrics are OhKay..<br>  Nothing special.<br>  And its a little cheesy but I like it. :]<br>  You singing it?<br>  Sadly. I almost died.

ppL5clgQaa	You ALWAYS ask such intersting questions! lol<br>  But they'd probably have to have an adult with them|`|SgvHVagmaa	I'd say they are. If they've been exposed to it on set or even if they have a few 'R' rated lines(like in Role Models), then they should be able to see the movie with their parents. The child actor should be mature enough to realize that some of the things they'll see or hear aren't appropriate for real life.|`|uOXfEOBQaa	not without parental guidance|`|Mr1Oayovaa	i would think so, they might have already know what was going on when they were acting(if they read the scripts.)|`|wtUnPEpPaa	I got to see them. It up to your parents if you could watch them!|`|9FzQOUjNaa	hmmm good question|`|7F0baAbNaa	if they stand on each others  shoulders and wear a big coat|`|6vgTVPtEaa	that's a good question, i think no|`|lGSUToFQaa	totally, why not i mean you let them act in them right<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  let's hope not|`|fC5X8swbaa	haha i dont think so but good question. :]|`|82cb8f9319b4af25b84a0e62e4814ffbaa	WOW that really is a good question. I would think or would hope that the parents of these children would shelter them some how from not only performing in this movie but from watching it. Who knows what really goes on in the homes and minds of celebrities or with those of children in movies. That is probably why some celebrities kids are so bad!|`|56bNLJykaa	If they went to a movie theater, not alone.. They have to have a parent with them|`|kA7GEKf7aa	No which probably sucks for them. They're probably thinking "what the hell? I practiced my lines and now they're not letting me on this sh*t".|`|ZllkWRIOaa	of course|`|kGkUG0fKaa	If their parent took them, yes. I take my son to R-Rated movies if its something he wants to see and he is almost 7.

3jBUTewUaa	heres the whole plot<br>  <br>  The Unborn is a supernatural thriller that draws upon the legend of a dybbuk, a malevolent spirit that refuses to leave the human world and inhabits the body of a person. Protagonist Casey Beldon (Odette Yustman) is plagued by merciless dreams, visions of strange looking dogs, and an evil child with bright blue eyes. The movie starts with Casey jogging, when suddenly, there is a blue glove on the trail. She picks it up and turns around to see a boy, with a blue glove missing from his left hand. After Casey blinks, the boy turns into a dog with a mask on. The dog walks into the forest, with Casey after it. Casey finds the mask on the ground, with the string buried in the dirt. She digs it up, and finds a piece of pottery with painting on it. It had a picture of a mother and her unborn child. Suddenly, the unborn baby opens its eyes.<br>  <br>  The next scene cuts to Casey baby-sitting Matty, her neighbor's son. He is upstairs, supposedly taking a nap. Casey is downstairs talking on the phone to her best friend Romey (Meagan Good). Suddenly, there is a voice that says "Jumby wants to be born now," on the baby monitor used for Matty's baby sister. After yelling, "Matty, are you awake?" Casey goes upstairs to check on them. Matty was standing over the baby's crib, holding a mirror to the baby's face. After being hit with the mirror, Casey's eyes begin to change color (see Tetragametic chimerism and Heterochromia) and she learns she had a twin brother who died in the womb. Casey begins to suspect that the spirit haunting her is the soul of her dead twin, being possessed by a dybbuk, wanting to be born so it can transfer to the world of the living.<br>  <br>  Casey meets a woman named Sofi, who is revealed to be her grandmother. Sofi explains that she had a twin brother who was killed in Nazi experiments in Auschwitz when they were both just children (presumably having been experimented on by Josef Mengele, as Sofi describes him as looking like an angel and Mengele was often referred to as the Angel of Death). The boy was brought back to life by a dybbuk who intended to use his body as a portal into the world of the living. Sofi killed her twin to stop the dybbuk, and now it haunts her family for revenge. Sofi refers Casey to Rabbi Sendak (Gary Oldman), who can perform a Jewish exorcism to remove the dybbuk.<br>  <br>  The exorcism is performed, but things go awry as the dybbuk tries to stop Rabbi Sendak from completing the ritual. Many people are wounded and others are killed. The exorcism is finally completed, and the dybbuk is drawn back from the human world. Casey's boyfriend is severely wounded and later dies with Casey by his side. Casey mourns him and she soon finds out that she is pregnant by him, with twins.

12QJ9QMRaa	Personally, I love it.<br>  <br>  No, it isn't as good as the "Sacred" first 4, but I like it as much as I do the Black album, which would put it at a solid 8 out of 10.<br>  <br>  I think Rob Trujillo is a great fit witht eh band, and now that Lars has tuned his drum set and found his second bass pedal, they sound pretty good again.<br>  <br>  I still don't understand where folks are coming from trying to compare the sound to the stuff they did in the 80s.  That was 20 years ago, and people change, so does their music.<br>  <br>  I find Slayer to be worse personally, because they are still trying to sound like angry 20 year olds, and it just sound like kids playing make believe, it lacks conviction.   Metallica may lack the speed and all out agression of their younger days, but James lyrics are just fine, and the music, IMO is great because it reflect where they are now, as opposed to the Load- St Anger years where they seeme dot be trying to hard to be something they weren't.|`|valvULe3aa	It's alright... I don't take it out of my CD case often, but I do dig the songs 'Cyanide' and 'Suicide and Redemption'.|`|vlIXsFmhaa	I give it a 6.5   Definitely listenable but not MetallicA.

Also, you could put a bunch of shaving cream in their hand, then tickle their nose, they'll then smear it on their face.  You don't necessarily have to do something while they're sleeping.  If it's still pretty cold outside, you can get all their underwear wet, then put it outside to freeze.  Also, if you freeze shaving cream in the can, then cut it open you can put the shaving cream block somewhere.  then, as it melts, it expands into a huge mess!  <br>  <br>  Those are a few, but be creative.

BlZ6vJOAaa	assuming you know what a Leo sun is supposed to be like (arrogant,dramatic, craves the limelight)<br>  Scorpio moon (first of all a good moon sign placement is a water sign so good for you)<br>  i would assume you might be a super intuitive person with alot of emotional depth and intensity.<br>  a bad side is that you might be seriously vengeful and jealous. easily filled with resentment. <br>  i find it might be unlikely with such a strong sun sign as Leo. so you might not have such feeling of vengeance because of this. (excellent place for a sun sign btw , Sun rules the Leo sign)<br>  <br>  Also i'm gonna add that although i don't know much about Libra rising it is said that they are very attractive if not physically then they certainly have an aura of beauty (this too is the ideal rising sign to have)<br>  you attract plenty of people to yourself this is very well complimented by your Leo Sun. People like you alot. you probably prefer to be in a relationship or always have a date.|`|9rGUexf3aa	Sure....Well your SUN sign is your main sign...you are a (LEO).....YOU are a Libra rising. Which means you have more Libra traits than any other sign that protrays to you in your chart. Thats your rising sign. The other planetary **** such as the Scorpio in moon are just other traits you personally carry from other planets and signs of the zodiac. Everyone is different and unique. Everybody carrys certain traits from other zodiac signs which makes everyone different. You may have a Leo friend that isnt exactly like you. But they are a Leo sign. But they also have different traits from other signs that you dont have. Its confusing i know.|`|izX7ymibaa	It means you are Tori Amos! lol<br>  <br>  Not really, but she has these same signs just in different order.

rNqF4gIVaa	Is there something relevant to classical music in this question?|`|oSXgtqYCaa	It's very good that you asked this question here, for William Joseph does bill himself as a pop classical 'artist'. And he is exciting to watch, isn't he?<br>  <br>  William Joseph is a young pianist that plays music of a contemporary pop style, with classical instruments and some classical styles thrown in. He is obviously trained and will have a great career most likely, as he is under the wings of David Foster. Mr. Foster is a master at both picking pop talent as well as promoting in ways that assure them of careers. <br>  <br>   I'd like to hear him play actual classical music to see what he can do! He's also gotten postive publicity, and rightly so, for receiving a lot of assistance from the wonderful Boys and Girls club in Arizona. <br>  <br>  He has a lot of youthful energy.I'm always happy when someone has a successful career, but there are many great instrumentalists that never get the exposure that Mr. Foster offers, and that part makes me a bit sad.<br>  <br>  If you enjoy him, try listening to Lang Lang or the Five Browns.

She agrees to make their living expenses free of charge if they succeed, but if they fail, she'll triple their rent.

Their wrestling loving fathers first introduced them to one another when they were 6 years old. Assuming that she was the best in wrestling, young Hikari challenged Kei to a wrestling match only to be thoroughly defeated by him. Ever since that fateful incident, Hikari swore to beat Kei in school grades, a sporting event - anything. To do this she has enrolled in the same school as Kei since elementary.

But also at her side is Zero Kiryu, a childhood friend who’s hatred for the creatures that destroyed everything he held dear, is now determined never to trust them. This coexisting arrangement seems all well and good, but have the vampires truly renounced their murderous ways, or is there a darker truth behind their actions. Is Kaname's infatuation with Yuki the beginning of a forbidden romance, or is it something in her forgotten past that draws him to her. Because in this world of secrets, nothing is as it seems. And the price of misplaced trust may even be worse than death.<br>  <br>  !!!Ichigo 100%!!!

Salsa tends to be 4-6 minutes long. But you can always edit a song with some music editing tool to make it shorter.<br>  <br>  If you are planning to dance salsa, I wouldn't recommend playing a chachacha since they are different rhythms and different dances. I'd use a real salsa song. <br>  <br>  You could try something really famous and classic like Llorarás by Oscar D'Leon.

J9g1fKS2aa	your inner animal is Metal Horse. For this year: <br>  <br>  The Metal Horse doesn't make the best camping buddy. Your relatively cold, self reliant nature, coupled with the Horse's love of freedom, make you a difficult Horse to get close to. You have strong determination and will go far as long as you can maintain focus. As human nature attracts us to that which we cannot have, it is not unlikely for you to be an object of our desire.

Bdgza4G2aa	I like a few different types.<br>  My favorite genres are shoujo, seinen, shounen-ai, horror/psychological, and steampunk.<br>  My favorite character is...Boogiepop the Angel of Death from Boogiepop Phantom. She. Is. Awesome.|`|M81kPDoLaa	I like shoujo, shonen and yaoi!<br>  My favorite shoujo of all time is Fruits Basket, although Katekyo Hitman Reborn comes a close second! (yes, it is a shoujo! just look at the character designs!)<br>  Shonen wise, I like Full Metal Alchemist the best cause Ed is just plain hilarious, and I like alot of the moral issues surrounding it.<br>  Yaoi...I prefer doujinshi when it comes to yaoi ^_^<br>  My all time favorite character, you ask? Hayato Gokudera from KHR of course!|`|KubD1fBLaa	i like manga that are:<br>  -romantic<br>  -super sad<br>  -has action<br>  -has fantasy<br>  -has school life<br>  -has gender bender<br>  ...(^_^)..|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	I don't think I have a favorite "type." Being the loser that I am, I'd have to choose With the Light, Inubaka and Death Note as my top three favorite manga. With the Light is a drama about a mother's experiences raising an autistic child; Inubaka is a shōjo full of cute dogs and a scantily-clad girls; Death Note is some sort of mystery-thriller shōnen thing. ..See? My tastes are eclectic. <br>  <br>  I like With the Light because it's educational, enlightening and sweet. I like Inubaka because the dogs are just adorable and it's an amusing story. I like Death Note because it's intriguing, action-packed and the characters are very easy to form bonds with.<br>  <br>  From With the Light, my favorite characters are Hikaru, Masato and that one teacher guy I can't remember. From Inubaka, my favorite characters are Kentaro and Kim, plus the dogs. From Death Note, my favorite characters are Matsuda, Mello, Matt, Aizawa and Sayu.

izX7ymibaa	btw aries, don't be too sure that you understand anything about scorpios. I'm scorpio, and I love my aries friends, but they just don't get me. You could be completely wrong about her.|`|8ssiOsDzaa	scorpios don't easily trust people, so don't take it personally, you just have to prove to her that you're trustworthy by doing things. for example if you're very close, always be next to her when she needs you and make her feel like you'll listening to her and that you're not here to know her problem then spread it to the whole world or something, if you're not that close you should get closer to her, it should be quite easy (i'm a scorpio and most of my close friends are aries). but don't give up even if she doesn't open up to you from the beginning, these things take time and a friendship takes lots of time to evolve and become more with scoprios|`|e297ec36aa9e3904ff06e84dd4fce511aa	scorpio's are very suspicious and secretive, maybe during a full moon after you've done a few spells

a2f1a6b961af33c6049c53468b288e28aa	One guitar. Pretty amazing, something called "cluster chords" and alternative tuning.<br>  <br>  Robin Frederick describes it here:<br>  <br>  He created a unique sound by combining Beatles-style chord progressions with the guitar innovations of the British folk music scene of the 1960's (pedal points - where the bass plays the same note under shifting chords - drones, and de-tunings). But he immediately leaped far ahead of his contemporaries in his use of "cluster chords" - these are chords that have more than the standard 3 notes of a major or minor chord and whose notes tend to be clustered very close together (creating minor or major seconds). Although easy to play on keyboards, they are a pain in the neck to play on guitar. Since most rock and pop songs were written on guitar in the '50's and '60's, you rarely heard them. Nick got around the problem of playing them by de-tuning his guitar - an idea he probably got from Bert Jansch (as did Jimmy Page), but his tunings were highly unusual, to say the least. And I do not know of a single guitar player in that time period (including Jansch) who was using cluster chords as extensively or fluidly as Nick was. Even when playing a simple major or minor chord on guitar, he was often singing the extension. It is one of the things that gives his work its contemporary and extremely identifiable sound... <br>  (more)<br>  <a href="http://www.robinfrederick.com/nd2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.robinfrederick.com/nd2.html</a>

a1Ngi39Xaa	I read thru a bunch of interviews with Matt Tuck and other band members but can't find anything about his religion.  I did find some info on the song:<br>  <br>  The music video shows the band performing in a warehouse. Throughout the video there are images having to do with war as the band play facing large screens displaying the image. It cuts back and forth between Matthew Tuck and the band. The lyrics of the song are about "going to war" as lead vocalist Matthew Tuck describes during live shows. For example, they scream "over the top" several times in the song. That is what soldiers called attempting to invade enemy lines during WWI. The video was directed by Iranian music video director, Tony Petrossian.|`|Fk54Y16qaa	Religion is a popular topic for music, so he may or may not be chrisitan.

835ZC2jUaa	Some easy songs would be money by pink floyd, pretty much anything by ACDC. If you would tell us what kind of music you listen to and what kind of music you want to play it would be easier to make suggestions.|`|M6c0hUefaa	I just got my bass re-strung and fixed after a year of it being messed up, so I feel like I'm starting all over, since I've really just been playing my guitar. When I first started playing a few years back, I played a lot of songs by the Pixies. Kim Deal is their bassist and most her bass lines are pretty basic. You can really try anything from any of their albums, but I personally like the song Hey. Look it up on ultimate-guitar.com and go to The Pixies, then to the song Hey. It's pretty basic and the song is fun to play. I also like Psycho Killer by Talking Heads, you can find it on there too. Good Luck to you and your bass playing :)

sNE6qwAOaa	It depends on who you're getting it for.  If it's for a smaller child, probably less than 12, I'd recommend a First Act guitar.  They're a little smaller to help with a child's smaller hands and arms, and they're a real bargain.  They have a good sound quality for the price, and they're fun to pick up and just play.  You can pick these up at Target, Wal Mart, or Toys R Us.<br>  <br>  If you're buying one for yourself or someone older than that, I would highly recommend going to your nearest guitar store and getting a 'starter pack.'  There are lots of these around for a very very good deal.  They typically come with a guitar, guitar stand, picks, and gig bag.  They usually run between $100 and $200 dollars and have some well known brands like Fender, Yamaha, and Ibanez.<br>  <br>  You can find good NEW guitars anywhere you go, so you shouldn't go to a pawn shop.  I would recommend this though: the electric guitar is a little easier to play than the acoustic, and it is usually better to start out with.  The strings are easier to press down, and the necks are a little smaller.  Also, they're fun to plug into the amp.  But get what pleases you! And I hope you find what you're looking for!  A guitar is a guitar, no matter how much it costs.|`|GNTFMQR3aa	here are some options for you<br>  <br>  two good quality dean acoustic guitars..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.guitaraudio.com/Items/mc-ak48?sck=1710689&caSKU=mc-ak48&caTitle=Dean%20AK48%20Tradition%20Dreadnought%20Acoustic%20Guitar%20w/%20Case" rel="nofollow">http://www.guitaraudio.com/Items/mc-ak48...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.guitaraudio.com/Items/mc-daytona?sck=1710689&caSKU=mc-daytona&caTitle=Dean%20Tradition%20Daytona%20Dreadnought%20Acoustic%20Guitar" rel="nofollow">http://www.guitaraudio.com/Items/mc-dayt...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  if you are looking for cheaper than that..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.guitaraudio.com/Items/mc-am200s?sck=1710689&caSKU=mc-am200s&caTitle=Amigo%20AM200S%20Dreadnought%20Solid-Top%20Acoustic%20Guitar" rel="nofollow">http://www.guitaraudio.com/Items/mc-am20...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.guitaraudio.com/Items/mc-am100?sck=1710689&caSKU=mc-am100&caTitle=Amigo%20AM100%20Dreadnought%20Natural%20%20Acoustic%20Guitar" rel="nofollow">http://www.guitaraudio.com/Items/mc-am10...</a>|`|2cAa9vRvaa	my first guitar was a FirstAct,<br>  and it was good, other than the fact I have to tune it pretty often :/|`|UAHjJpC0aa	Yamaha<br>  Fender <br>  Ibanez<br>  Samick<br>  <br>  make the best entry level guitars<br>  <br>  but stay away from the "starcaster" stuff<br>  <br>  check out your local music store<br>  that has a guitar tech<br>  that can make sure that the neck is straight<br>  the "action" is low<br>  no string buzz etc<br>  <br>  good luck|`|Y6pHjVP9aa	Are you just starting out?<br>  You might find it best to go to a pawn shop and buy one there for around 80-100 bucks.

ZyGyDLsDaa	The Halfway House (2004)<br>  starring Mary Woronov, Janet Tracy Keijser, Shawn Savage, Stephanie Leighs, Athena Demos, Monica Shere<br>  IMDb synopsis:<br>  Young girls are disappearing in and around the Mary Magdalen Halfway House for Troubled Girls. Desperate to find out what became of her sister, Larissa Morgan goes undercover to infiltrate the Catholic-run institution. Once inside, she encounters Father Fogerty, a priest with a passion for punishment; Sister Cecelia, a nun with a dark past plotting an even blacker future; tough Latino Angelina and her home girls and a sinister handyman named Lutkus. It's not long before she's caught up in a twisted web of sadism, violence, and wanton lust before finally learning the ultimate secret of the Halfway House.<br>  IMDb review excerpt: **SPOILER**<br>  Sister Cecelia (Woronov) is a bit looney, and the creepy handyman is her accomplice in SOMETHING that goes on in the basement, involving a one-eyed, tentacled monster from beyond. Of course, it all has something to do with a stolen copy of "The Necronomicon" that disappeared from Miskatonic University a few years ago.<br>  TRIVIA:<br>  Miskatonic University is mentioned by Officer Sheen to Larissa, who asks, "Where have I heard that before?" This is a reference to H.P. Lovecraft, who used this fictitious University in some of his stories. "The Necronomicon" is a book created by Lovecraft for his Cthulhu Mythos.

Giacchino admitted personal pressure in scoring the film, as "I grew up listening to all of that great [Trek] music, and that's part of what inspired me to do what I'm doing [...] You just go in scared. You just hope you do your best. It's one of those things where the film will tell me what to do.Scoring took place from September to October 2008.

2bVxBCgzaa	music in public spaces is considered to be a background, and is there to 'fill the space'; it's meant to go mostly unnoticed. So they choose the least offensive, most 'pleasant' music, which is why Muzak is played in elevators and grocery stores. Store owners etc want upbeat, familiar-sounding music with melody, so the majority of customers feel 'at home'.|`|LwqM7EHVaa	Blues or Jazz would be perfect at work to mellow you down.|`|GGAgxzJNaa	It's probably conducive to a good work environment.  It doesn't put people to sleep but it doesn't distract them from their work.|`|r9lfDeRmaa	I would rather listen to some metal, Cradle of Filth, Children of Bodom, Motograter, Lordi I could rock out and get lots of stuff done to that, and most of the time I do with my headphones.|`|CjPtAEzmaa	morgues?!<br>  Thats crazy.<br>  I like soft rock.

And it's always old stuff too.|`|1mZjbvmwaa	Yeah, well i guess because it's what's radio friendly or maybe because it's good music, but personally i can't take too much of it.

Qu7GIg6Haa	Oh, dear, I am so so sorry, and I hope things improve for your family. In 1980 my sister was shot by her husband. He shot her three times in the head and turned the gun on himself. She survived, he did not. She still has many bullet fragments in her brain which they could not remove without causing further damage. She has some problems with fine motor skills,especially when she gets tired, but she is actually doing quite well for what she experienced. She was in her early 40's when this all happened. I know how the worry must be affecting you. Just keep breathing and take it day by day. I do wish you and your family the best.|`|LvywvZSeaa	I'm so sorry to hear what you are going through. I just wanted to let you know that this question is posted in the reality tv section, so that's probably why you don't have any answers. Try posting it in a health category or something.<br>  <br>  Again, I am so sorry. I hope everything goes well, and your father makes a full recovery. Good luck, and keep your head up!

oKyimeaMaa	wow, you sound just like me...<br>  <br>  i started playing trumpet in 7th grade and my teacher never taught us about tone quality, articulation, embouchure, or anything...if i was given i piece of music and someone asked me to name a note, i wouldnt be able to...<br>  <br>  by my freshman year of high school, i wasnt that great at all and i wasnt even around average...now its my junior year, and i play first trumpet and instantly became section leader because i practiced so much and i just basically got above everyone else...<br>  <br>  since i still didnt know my notes, i decided to teach myself the notes and within a couple days, i knew all the note letters...<br>  <br>  articulation and tone just came from my director because i actually listen in class, so i suggest you ask your teacher or you look online on stuff that can help...|`|AA10292870	The first answer was unfortunately a common problem in music. Finding a good teacher is very difficult and causes problems for people who want to learn how to play any musical instrument. I also have had both good and bad instructors on both trumpet and piano. It's easy to say to someone to find a good teacher ,but  very hard to accomplish!One thing I do advise is to get the great DVD called I Love The Trumpet by Warren Vache. The DVD is 4 hours of excellent trumpet playing advice which is not the complete answer but it gives you the basis to judge a good teacher ,and believe me Warren Vache is the real deal. The DVD is available from his website warrenvache.com or from amazon.com. Get the DVD and start a real helpful trumpet education experience. Also there is a website called trumpetmaster.com where you can ask all kinds of trumpet specific advice. Good luck and good trumpet playing!

V1hxvQukaa	seriously? wow... i'm just a year older and i've been watching horror movies FOREVER. my fav genre =]<br>  <br>  anyway, back to the shining. it's less scary and more creepy. not too much of people jumping out from behind bushes, but people going insane and trying to kill their family. <br>  <br>  so yea, it's a great movie, and i guess it won't give you nightmares...|`|rKSs8Wejaa	dam dude seriously get your balls up!! its like a 7 but its a good movie omg i think your some little rich kid huh well just for the record i watched the shinning for the first time when i was 6 seriously and i saw the exorsist when i was 5 iam not jokeing!! so watch it and be a men!!|`|OLQmoyNSaa	when i was maybe 4-6 years old,<br>  i watched the shining (1997) and it scared me a lot.<br>  it scares me a little bit now.. like, this lady from<br>  the tub still scares me.. give it a try!<br>  its an interesting movie too, you'll enjoy it!<br>  just have at least 1 person with you,,<br>  fyi, i was afraid to go to the bathroom after i watched it.. hehe xD|`|hEx2hBTCaa	Its kinda scary.   i would give it a 6 or 7 for scariness.  But there are one or two scenes that are very disturbing.  concidering your history id say it will scare you a fair bit tho.|`|wZlqxCTNaa	It's more suspenseful and tense, as opposed to bloody and gory. And unlike most horror movies, it's actually good. It's well-written, and Stanley Kubrick did a great job directing it. Example: the scene where Jack Nicholson is trying to chop through the door with the axe. Watch how the camera follows the swinging axe. Rather than film it from a few feet back, Kubrick keeps the camera close. The rapid movement of the camera following the axe makes the scene more tense and violent than if he had filmed it from a single, non-moving position.|`|pEnyA5qnaa	It's really scary|`|TvTg82wyaa	It's not scary, but it's creepy and suspenseful. AMAZING film!!!|`|rswnwCBWaa	due wht seriously whats the point of watching a scary movie if its not scarry you should watch 1408 thats a good one|`|O2hmjOPyaa	With your background, the movie would probably be rated an "8." The movie had more "thriller"-type moments, ones that get your heart racing, as opposed to an outright scream-factor.|`|56bNLJykaa	It's not that scary (around 6), but a good film

FdqCnU03aa	xDD Yes, that's cool!<br>  <br>  <br>  >.> and it totally fits him.|`|YzpnWEHUaa	Finding the kanji for his name in a google search to be 裏腹喜祐, and double-checking with a dictionary that it's right,  you get: <br>  <br>  裏腹 (urahara) - reverse, contrary, opposite<br>  喜 (ki) - rejoice, take pleasure in<br>  祐 (suke) - help<br>  <br>  I guess it's similar to what you've come up with; something like "opposite of taking pleasure in help". I would take it to mean he doesn't like helping others, and if he does, doesn't take pleasure in it. Or even perhaps taking pleasure in not helping others. <br>  <br>  Suits him, still.

CDyHU3Qaaa	band of brothers|`|AA11646252	It depends on what you want to watch.  for the russian front there is "enemy at the gate" and i really like the mini series from hbo "band of brothers".  "Saving private ryan" seems way to long and drawn out.  Flyboys is interesting love story but not a best war movie one.  There are more but can not think of them now.<br>  <br>  rd|`|zovrJ0yXaa	in my personal opinion, saving private ryan was way too melodramatic to be an effective world war 2 movie. it was action packed and visceral but it really didnt comment on war beyond seeing people blown to pieces. for me, a much better world war 2 movie was the thin red line. it came out the same year as private ryan but was very different. it focused less on seeing people being blown up and worried more about the philosophical implications of war, what it means to people, and why people fight wars. its a lot more thought provoking than private ryan, which, past the action, doesnt really have anything to say|`|hWicwGUmaa	There are many, but the best one i have seen is Saving Private Ryan.<br>  It seems like every war movie is about that one, though.|`|VY3yOzqAaa	"Saving Private Ryan" was one of the best I've seen.

c515a77725833baaf00c86cd0353807faa	I was 4 years away from being born when Elvis died, but I know people who were there and did cry. I became an Elvis fan when I was 5 and I can't watch his funeral or the candlelight vigil without tears coming to my eyes. OK let's face it, you admitted it, I'll admit it...I cry my eyes out. I am always amazed at the magnatism of Elvis. I don't know of any other artist that not only has a larger fan base than when he was alive, but is still as popular, if not more, than some of the artists today. I also don't know of anybody that people still cry so hard over and miss so much 30 years after their death. Elvis is an amazing person and always will be.|`|bnWc2Vkqaa	Yes, I cried.|`|AA11684065	I was only 5, in 1977... I hadn't learned about Elvis until 1981 & when I knew he had already died it hurt real bad...Especially in 1987 on the 10th anniversary of his passing, that particular moment hurt me very very badly indeed...It felt awful to me...Because he was so talented & so kind hearted, it broke my heart to see the pain he had endured, what the drugs did to him etc...It felt like the loss of someone whom you thought you knew, like a beloved family member!<br>  <br>  The pain has subsided over the years, but sometimes, when I hear My Way & Unchained Melody from 1977, it still hurts inside!|`|nJOYHuyZaa	Yes I did. As did most of the world.<br>  I cried when John Lennon died too.<br>  I'm a cry baby!!!

She is really fat and always makes up rumors about herself like she will say that she got molested or that she is pregnant. Last year I was in the same P.E. class as her and all year she would lie and say she had something wrong with her to get out of P.E.  She would ALWAYS wear a big baggy sweatshirt and long pants.  My theory is she had some weird skin disease and it was either super contagious OR she just didn't want anybody to see it. That's why she wouldn't do P.E. She was scared to change in the locker room because of her disease. Now I don't know if it's true but it's a pretty good theory.<br>  <br>  You get a star!<br>  <br>  <br>  ~Claire~|`|jLwCzblBaa	I have a brilliant theory.<br>  <br>  If we all just ignore Nalia/Natty it might just p1ss off back into whatever hole it crawled out from. <br>  <br>  What do you think?|`|hCV5Hyqfaa	If you have sex upside down the orgasm last up to 50 minutes|`|b1294888a8e10ac6a8ff0614d97982ccaa	Soylent Green and Pot Noodles are dead people.|`|Lj2mo4ooaa	Theory about YA:<br>  <br>  People will only answer questions that make them feel smart . . . that boost their egos . . . but will not answer questions that really make them think deeply.

You are lacking a religion that is your problem. but ppl shouldn't judge you based on your religion or rather lack of.  i am a Christian, but good luck in finding new friends.|`|m32KuQHyaa	Religion shouldn't be crucial to all friendships- especially casual. I'm an atheist and I keep it to myself. Spares me from those who hope to save me from burning in hell.|`|J3REXSldaa	Ditch your friends of they have problems with your beliefs. If you probably attacked them because of your beliefs, then they have aright to be mad.|`|qwInrvUGaa	atheism isn't a religion and your friends can't be that great of friends if they would stop being your friend cause you are an atheist you believe what you believe|`|T6WYXtdfaa	try keeping your religion to yourself.|`|VQPgNedQaa	i hope they werent u suck at life|`|KrJqVyRVaa	I agree with "Just here"<br>  <br>  God is Good|`|B4y9w6Braa	Look.... If they're REALLY your friends.... They won't care what your religious views are. If they are your friends they will love you no matter what. And I'm so sorry about thee break up. Don't change yourself because your friends have a "God" to look up to and you don't. I'm a atheist too and all my friends are very religious. I know what you feel like. I'm not too sure they are really my friends so I try not to let my views and stuff get in the way TOO much. That's all I can tell you from the information you gave me but I really hope I helped! =]<br>  Take care. <br>  Sincerely, me.|`|EMfLFsXEaa	Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't atheism more like, lack of religion?<br>  <br>  Regardless, your friends and girlfriends should love you for YOU, not for your religious beliefs. What you believe in terms of God, no God, etc. is something very personal to you and it's a decision that only you can make for yourself. It doesn't stop you from being a good person. '<br>  <br>  If your friends do not agree with your religion, then they have every right to, every one has a right to their own opinion but it shouldn't stop them from being your friend. If they do stop being your friend over a difference of opinion, then maybe they weren't real good friends to begin with.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|5IsOgX8jaa	Atheism isn't a religion. And if your friends and gf dislike you for not believing in higher power(s), that just means they are sucked so far into their own religion that they are too stubborn to emerge from their cold rocks to face reality. To face the fact that there are people out there that are different. Don't change yourself for a bag of morons. It WILL cause self-destruction, because if you dislike any changes you make because of peer pressure, then you will resent the people around you and then hate yourself.|`|RvddYKqjaa	i don't know why you have to share your lack of religious faith. It's your business. Those girls are not friends at all if they can't handle you being yourself. They don't have to like your views to be your friends. Religion, or lack of it, shouldn't be your topic of conversation. If you are convicted to believe as you do, and they can't accept that, you have to move on or change for them. Personally, I would move on and make a conscientious effort to keep some of your views private. I don't mean you should change who you are though. <br>  I honestly don't get why she became your gf if your lack of faith was too much for her to handle.|`|14UfFR3qaa	Oh poor Nick... It must be sad losing your girlfriend. Just because your friends dont like your views, doesn't mean they don't like you! Don't change what you believe in, just so your friends like you when they already do, and if they do end up not likeing you, well that means they wern't good friends to start with.|`|VlWgZ9unaa	you dont need "religion" you need Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior. He died on the cross to give us eternal life, and if we accept Him as or Lord and Savior, we can go to heaven instead of spending eternity in hell. and yes, we all sin  (mess up and do stupid things) but if we ask for forgiveness, our Awesome God will forgive us! God will never let you down. He will asways be there for you and He loves you very much. God is good! If you wanna talk just ask more ?'s and ill be there =)   -Hannah ?

There might still be strain on the ear from when it got pierced. Remember to LIGHTLY clean it. If it's got no redness or discharge it's probably not an infection. Just be careful with it, and make sure it doesn't get worse and turn into an infection over time.

f639092fc925bbd55e7b6272eeb17334aa	I am not certain of he movie which you are referring to so I will speak in a generality but "sensuality" is a discrete way of saying that the movie includes some scenes that have people simulating sex, as in grinding on one another, to which you can not say that there was any nudity shown, but; it was clear to the audience that the couple was having intercourse. You could say that for deleted scenes in the movie "The Notebook" where they made the body motions look so realistic that you did not have any choice but to have to explain what was going on in the scene to a minor. And, it does not have to be intercourse. Some caresses of the buttocks, breasts and genital region are seen to be sensual if not explicitly sexual. At any rate, that is what they are trying to avoid by using the word "sensual", the appearance of mature behavior that parents will have to explain to a child.|`|AqDson6zaa	Like if a woman is constantly wearing really tight, nearly see-through clothes, if there is sex or near-sex, etc. It may not be the sole reason it's R, but it may contribute. <br>  <br>  Personally, I think the rating system's bung full of holes.

Tj2xROpwaa	she is doing very horrible things by going back to chris.<br>  first off all she is submitting herself to someone who does not respect, care, or love her.<br>  <br>  second, she was beat by him and she still doesn't get a clue? we all know this is going to happen again and it won't be as shocking.<br>  <br>  third, i think that before this whole scandal he must have hit her.  he has probably beat her a lot before.<br>  <br>  not only does she seem weak, she is sending the message to people especially young vulnerable women that it is OK to be BEAT UP. I mean what the hell. she needs to go to a psychologist and get the hell away from chris|`|G6Uy43coaa	People send wrong messages all the time.  It doesn't mean you have to listen and agree with them.  She will learn not to be so trusting.  Hopefully he will learn his way to the counseling office.  <br>  <br>  My 13 year old son wanted to add that he does not think she is sending that message at all.  He thinks if you truly love someone you should try and work it out.  But if you don't think that person can change, you need to leave that relationship and move on to a healthier one.|`|UKTJyvxpaa	I guess if you truely love someone you could try to work it out, but I don't see why she would go back to him after he abused her. For all we know, he could have done other things to her (abuse) that we don't know about. <br>  <br>  Happens once, shame on him.<br>  Happens twice, shame on her.|`|x6rHjPIIaa	yea I kind of agree|`|et9gdoDKaa	I think the media is sending those messages since they seem to be so deeply involved in peoples' personal lives.|`|jMF1LiGnaa	i agree, she should stand up for herself because she was a good role model but if she can't see that shes sending out the wrong message who knows what Chris brown would do to her now?|`|xyqHMiLjaa	I dont think thats a good idea, since, well, DIDN'T CHRIS BEAT THE CRAP OUT OF HER?!?! <br>  <br>  Why would she go back with him!??!? It makes no sense to me..|`|DTMcfGc4aa	Yes, she is saying that women can't stand up for themselves. She is a fool..|`|b9cZE7nTaa	yes shes utterly crazy for staying with a guy who put her to the hospital|`|hwDtWCAjaa	i think she is sending the wrong message by staying with him|`|eroEFDmfaa	She aint got no self respect I reckon|`|grifjdr0aa	No.  Of course she doesn't have any self-respect, he beat it out of her.  And I'm sure he's told her over and over again, and now she believes it.  <br>  <br>  As for your opinion your entitled to it, --ignorance is bliss.|`|2PTlXs9zaa	Domestic violence isn't just a snap of your fingers cure, it takes time to help yourself out of it - multitudes of women do it.

BlA60kDVaa	I am a sound engineer, musician and sound designer.<br>  <br>  The process can be achieved in several ways.  For those artists who don't notice or remember sound and movement often need to have the voice artists visual expressions recorded previous, or at least be present when the audio recording takes place.  Animators will often refer to these animated expressions on the voice over artists face and use them in their own work when animating.<br>  <br>  When tighter budgets are adhered to, it is often up to the sound engineer/designer or animator to model the sound or picture/animation alone.<br>  <br>  Either or.  It often works better when everyone works together as one constant unit.|`|dySHIwYxaa	most quality animation the speech is recorded first. Then the animators can sinc the mouth movements exactly to the given style of speech. Adding the final artistic mouth moments to the draft animation.<br>  <br>  From the story board to the final cut, there could be many animation adjustments and voice over adjustments as needed.<br>  <br>  Also many quality animations try to capture the recorded facial movements too. Common if a famous celeb. is used. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Cheaper/ simple animation will just over dub the voices at the end.|`|CBVl4Adsaa	I'm not sure they all do it the same, but I watched a program on somthing like this and I saw the people doing the voices while watching the animated film if you get me.

And I'm definitely not worried about dying neither to clear it up.<br>  <br>  Will I throw myself out in front of a bullet for no reason? No. But will I run in fear from inevitable death? Hell no.

"i wanna talk to my daddy.  give me my daddy". etc<br>  <br>  they get her dad there and she's gone<br>  <br>  here i am sitting there freezing in a cell not bothering anyone and the cops are busy with other stuff<br>  <br>  i'm there all night<br>  <br>  i'm calling for the cops and they wouldn't come<br>  <br>  i wanted a meal or blankets or something ye know<br>  <br>  they don't come forever so i decide i'm gonna put my sock in the toilet (make um pay ye know).  and i toss my shirt over the water drain.  miracle shot by the way it was a long shot<br>  <br>  then i keep holding down the flush button while the whole floor floods.  the goofs sit there for about an hour probably watching this before their dumb asses decide to show<br>  <br>  i get nailed with a mischief because they're stupid<br>  <br>  it's on my record|`|dMvsVqS2aa	Jesus christ doesnt live in anyone.<br>  <br>  He's a mythical figure and is used to manipulate gullible people like you.<br>  <br>  <br>  As for the question, no i have not been arrested before..

CWUb6eTWaa	I have seen the latest trailer on line and I cant help but laugh at yet another dumb trailer. The Star Trek that Gene Rodderenberry created is sadly gone away. The only thing that seem to have stayed was the names. JJ seemed to have missed the whole point of the franchise. There is so many conflicts with this movie and the traditional franchise that i'm not even going to bother go into any more. The only postive thing I have for this movie is that its going to have some great effects.

Xf3US46Faa	ok, thats a question that alot of beginners ask alot!, ive been playing guitar for 6 almost 7 years and i like to sit and play when im at home and when im at home i dont play with a strap sitting down there no need for it, one thing you could do is make shure your holding the guitar closer to youre body and relax try not to be so tence because u can hurt your self really bad by pulling musles and what not. but yeah try that out and hopefuly it works.|`|47QsxtN0aa	I'd ask this in medical|`|sdwYf4dLaa	I used to have the same problem.  I learned it was my form.  When you play try to always make sure you sitting up straight and not slouching.  Just the same as if you sit at the computer all night slouching your shoulders will hurt.  The strap could be pulling at your shoulders to make you slouch worse.  I never use a strap unless I'm standing up. Also, I had the same problem with my left wrist.  Always make sure your wrist isn't bent.. When I finally figured that out my playing time doubled.|`|k5qDoSFvaa	try not wearing the strap dude.

Everything is popish,hardly any have alot if any substance. Rap is also taking the pop route as well as rock and even country (i.e. taylor swift).<br>  We also love independent and undiscovered artists nowadays,I believe that's due to internet exposure,diversity and the music industry releasing crappier music since we don't buy it anymore.|`|09fdLaeIaa	i think we are in the rock era

Like no hater,I just don't think he can/tries to sing. People like him,britney,ciara and janet jackson aggravate the heck outta me,its like people,you got a contract for SINGING,why aren't you atleast trying to sing? There are plenty of better dancers then them who won't be famous just because they aren't attractive and big enough sell outs to get a record deal because they can dance. lmao,wasn't tryna rant but its true.|`|dbkeVZTUaa	Females probably like him because they like his music or because they think he is good looking.|`|rmGqThOOaa	i love him no matter what<33333

VQpu20kDaa	Yep she took the final pill|`|1OJNgIVyaa	She took the final pill and is no longer pregnant. That is why next week ronnie doesn't want her babysitting Amy as she doesn't think it right for her to be around kids.|`|vBwVheaXaa	Yes she did, she went with Ronnie (unknown to her that she's  her mum and Danielle terminating her grandchild)<br>  <br>  So she finally decided to take the pill and now the baby is gone because she thought she couldn't cope and she didn't want a baby in the first place in a result of a one night stand with this sleazy guy.|`|uYGdpD9Aaa	Yea she took the final pill.<br>  So her baby is dead :(<br>  <br>  <br>  She would ave made a great mum.|`|2716717868fe21f32f85869cd02f81d8aa	She took the final pill|`|Jaw2sW3eaa	I think she did take the second one.|`|lTmrWBRlaa	No. First pill -  Stacey barged in and told her not to but she took it anyway as Ronnie said it was for the best. But Ronnie secretly didn't want her to take it. (The Nurse thought that Ronnie was Danielle's mum) Danielle asked Ronnie if she would go with her for the second pill. Ronnie said yes but later on, after Ronnie had spoken to Dot she phoned Danielle and told her she couldn't go. Danielle then asked Ronnie if she regretted giving away her baby. Ronnie said no but really she does. Danielle then went to the clinic with Stacey. the nurse asked where her mum was. Danielle said her mum was dead and took the pill. <br>  <br>  Danielle doesn't realize that it wasn't Ronnie's choice to put her up for adoption. It was Archie's choice.|`|MCXsFvgnaa	Danielle did take the final pill to terminate her pregnancy, but i don't think they showed that, but do you remember at the R and R club when stacey told that bloke who got danielle pregnant that she aborted it, so i think she actually did take the final pill, but they might not have shown it, or i wasn't paying attention.<br>  <br>  Nish|`|98WKYtfwaa	She did take the 2nd pill, even if she didn't take it, her baby would've died because the first pill kills the baby and the 2nd one flushes the baby out the uterus. <br>  <br>  Sick i know.|`|sqO80pm9aa	If she took the second pill, I missed it and since several answers say they "think" or "believe" she did, I am not the only one.

oSlNA4Y9aa	U2 because they are commited to caring and showing people how much we should mean to each other. i was watching some morning show when it snowed and they were out in the snow with shovels scraping a lot of snow off the roads and working hard without having to. they are also very good at giving back and recognizing issues arising in the whole world. i think they care about the world more than the fame and material things. they are very influential! a lot of artists have covered their song "one" which you should listen to because it explains everything, but they do too much to put down.
