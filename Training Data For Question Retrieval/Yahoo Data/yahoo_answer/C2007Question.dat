20090309155237AAp3xer	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Blackberry Bold or iPhone 3G?	I know this subject has been discussed a hundred times, but I figured I'd give my two cents.      I have an upgrade coming soon and am having trouble deciding between the two.  I know that both phones apply to unique individuals so here are my demographics.      I would say that I'm a casual user and would be using the phone for casual purposes.  I do a lot of emailing, text, etc.  Don't really browse the web that much, but you never know when it would come in handy.  Same goes for the use of GPS.  I do travel overseas for an extended period of time and was wondering which phone would offer the best international plan in terms of data.      I understand that "Mobile Me" pushes onto both phones so that's cool.    I also hear that the call quality is good on both phones as well, although the visual voice mail is a plus.  Looking for the best phone in terms of reliability, quality, and ease of use      Just need some unbiased opinions from people who have dealt with both phones to see what you think.  Hope this makes sense and thanks in advance.

I bought the game yesterday and it kicks *** just like previous socoms. I have seen that all the websites like gamespot and others are only reviewing the game based on server issues. In gamespot it got a 6.5/10 which sucks and the only bad thing they had to write about it was that it didnt have a single player campaign and that the lagging servers ruined it. WTH is that, you dont review a game on it's servers considering the fact that mandatory updates are always made for games. You review a game on its gameplay, story, sound, graphics, control, organization, and other factors. Does anyone here agree with me?

20090309173624AAysd4i	Consumer Electronics;Cameras	How can I take decent night photos with my Nikon Coolpix 10?	I'm going to Greece soon and I am bringing my little Coolpix digital camera.  It takes pretty good photographs with the flash inside or outside during the day, but I can't quite figure it out for shots at night.  I mean, when I shoot something that is well lit and turn off my flash I often get blurry images. Am I stuck with that (unless I use a tripod) or am I doing something wrong?      Thanks,      Anna            PS Oh, one more thing about this camera. I used to have a Kodak digital and used the fill flash a lot, and was quite happy with the results. But now, with my Nikon my subjects are washed out as if the flash is too bright.  Even though they are standing the same distance -- about 5-8 feet away.  It was a perfect distance for the Kodak, but not for the Nikon. Am I stuck with having my subjects step back a few feet?      Any ideas?

I have a ipod shuffle, but I was looking into something new! I looked at a few differnt brands, but I ran into the complication of transfering the music in my itunes. Is there anything on the cheaper side that would still work with itunes? I was looking at the zunes or the Ematic. I am very new to this kind of thing. I would prefer somthing that I can read the title on a screen unlike the shuffles. Thanks!
