They had an album out before Marlon Brando died.|`|8XT1Tvcvaa	Oh man, what ever happened to Y Not (from Common's Resurrection album). That dude was sick on "Chapter 13" but never heard anything else from him.|`|dOurKVdiaa	RBX, Chronic    6'4, he was on the 2001 album    Jewel, from Chronic days    AZ, I know he had his own albums, but it never really took off for him, i thought he was good    Cormega, Nas album, the DefJam album that they never release    Nature, He wasnt all that good on the Firm album, to me he looked like Sadat X from BrandNu    Sauce Money, from the Street Is Watching Days with JayZ    Sporty Thievez: like a more flashy version of the LOX    the whole roster from that 1st AfterMath album, better yet never mind    ANd speaking of never mind, the whole faux Pac and Snoop Doggy Dog from the post Dre and Pac Tha Row...TheRealest and Topp Dogg|`|f878535d0bae9326cb1189369fe41c5caa	warren g---- m.c ren    dj yella gangsta nip        alot of people from no limit-------- that fat lady|`|HL8W9yU6aa	Jane Doe, Punch & Words.|`|14I0CwI0aa	quan. he did a song on Nas's album Street's Disciple and was supposed to be his protege. it sucks cause i think he could have became one of the best.

fQLeIAh1aa	I th6ink it may turn into something because of the fact that he knows all about drugs and now her ex boyfriend is on drugs and shunning her, her child hood friend is on drugs. And to top things off her baby "died" at the hands of dr. joplin. And he knows all the secrets about it all. They are probably going to do something like" they fall in love/lust and she finds the letter or he tells her the truth about it all. she gets upset and runs into Cole's arms." that's my guess lol.|`|UY3zl9dFaa	I don't really see a relationship forming, but I do see Cole (in his drug-induced state) misinterpreting their friendship (as he did that first hug) and causing problems for Mr. Joplin.|`|AA12390047	I think a possible relationship is very likely.  They have a weird sort of connection.  But, if he's the drug dealer, it'll be short-lived.|`|fjNxzd6Baa	I expect an accusation of a relationship that will threaten his job. Somebody's going to report Starr hugging him all the time. Maybe that threat to his job will be what keeps him from divulging the existence of the letter from his mother.|`|AA10071149	I think that would be inappropriate. Her behavior towards him is already a bit inappropriate. I wouldn't be a fan of that story line if it were to happen.|`|EQP8VZwiaa	I hope not.|`|7XM4QJiuaa	It's illegal but possible.|`|YFMaRxaWaa	noway.but they may have a relationship to keep Joplin from telling on Todd.

6pevwBizaa	Big developed some sort of issue with his back and had to take a break and then he decided he wanted some time off to spend with his family. So far, they're saying this is only a temporary break. Meanwhile, Rich is working on a solo career but says he is still commited to the band. He just released a new single, "Another You." It's available on iTunes and YouTube for anyone who wants to know where to hear it.|`|ErGQOhjqaa	Don't know, but it's too bad John Rich got sidetracked with, "Gone County".  It, and he, sucks.  He was really a nice guy until the exposure went to his head.  Now he is a jerk.  If they get back together, I wish them well.  They were a very good duet team.|`|Ofrcw7hYaa	John Rich was caught with a transexual prostitute. They have run him out of nashville.|`|7a9ca1e0d676415430d900245a7c2d25aa	I think they have a tour planned this summer.

zVdNQowNaa	Lil' Jon's appearance is a practical joke, his rapping is a verbal joke.    Overall, he's a pretty complete comedian.|`|VSsCZ2N6aa	That was ok. I kinda agree with Nikki lol.|`|wfZhkZO0aa	I luv Lil Jon.  When I am having a bad day, it always makes me smile to look at him.  OK, aside from the fact that he is the biggest joke on this side of the Atlantic, you gotta admit the man makes you feel better about yourself.  He's so... well I don't need to explain it.

vO9fPCm2aa	Noah and Eden keep on lying to be together as a couple and keep getting caught. LOL they are really bad at it if you ask me. Since Nick and Sharon are not there to ask he has to go to Phyllis. She really tried this time too, going as far as to drive them to where they need to be or so they said. She'll get in trouble for this also. :~)|`|ryEiHFOnaa	i don't know. it is all crazy.|`|arjB50zBaa	I think that she is just following Nick's rules.  The last time Phylis just gave to Noah and didnt ask him he ended up at a party.  Actually this is new for Phylis, normally she just gives into Noah and defends him to Nick, kids will be kids but Nick and Sharon got into her sh*t for this more than once.  So I thinks it just a matter of respecting the parents wishes, which I dont know why because they dont respect her....cheaters!|`|4kuWOZowaa	Because Noah..backed up by Eden is a Huge Lier!!!! So many times So many times.|`|uUzbqGh5aa	Wouldn't you be hard on a teenager who keeps telling lies to his parents and has been in trouble more than once?!|`|hNa5oHxQaa	She has full responsibility on Noah and he's been in trouble before and she doesn't want him to get in an more trouble.|`|5f0111f71db8592710a5d1cb4897be4aaa	Noah has proved on several occasions that he cant be trusted ( just being a normal teenager ) It's like every time he leaves the house he's lying to Nick ,,Sharon  and Phyllis and running off with Eden getting into some kind of trouble !  Poor kid,,,,Eden is going to be his worst nightmare if he doesn't  quit hanging with her!|`|AA10623143	I don't understand why Phyllis is even the one making the decision!   For two parents who supposedly care so deeply for Noah I find it ridiculous that Nick and Sharho are without cell phone service or any kind of phone service....    Noah should be on the phone with them asking for their approval.  I hate Nick for putting Phyllis in this position.  So now when they get into any trouble it will be all Phyllis's fault.|`|CyVxolNHaa	Phyllis is a loser, and cannot trust anyone, who she should not be trusting is herself!

That is a hammer on...    just keep practicing..once you get better you can play more clearly and swiftly and even hammer on/pull off multiple notes at a time and use it in chords etc...  Good luck :)

7623Hd7naa	Cake! I've been a Cake fan since I went to high school with Jon McCrea's sister in high school, 1994. We even convinced them to play at our "Earth Day" celebration, two years in a row!<br>  <br>  Besides that, I'm not a Franz Ferdinand fan :-)|`|tcFGLlS3aa	Who would name a band Cake?<br>  Sorry, I'm not a fan of "music" from this era.<br>  <br>  Personally I would much rather see an actual cake on stage than either of these bands. Maybe some red velvet cake, that would be cool. I would want a slice of course, but I don't see how they could split that cake between the entire audience.  It would have to be a huge cake, or a ton of little cakes. Yum...|`|kC3VwbfRaa	FF is a great band with terrific songs, but THEY BLOW LIVE!|`|GEIRkfAeaa	I'd rather icepick my ******* ears.

The fact that people want to tape their acts of sadism is not surprising, it is the people who love to watch and are thrilled by the violence they see.  The whole hinge of the movie is that if people stopped watching the person would survive and more and more people kept tuning in and the more you told people not to look the more people signed on.  It reminds me of the videos that came out several years back of terrorist beheadings, people watched those videos over and over again, my friends included.  I merely heard a part of one of those videos one time and still have nightmares.  People disconnect themselves so much from people on the other side of the computer screen that it is truly scary.|`|41dgPeRtaa	no i have seen the movie, and been on the website.. it is a game you play.. it's nothing real just a game to beat the killer..<br>  try it..|`|rpDjOaaTaa	umm.... i dont know i havent went to the website but seen the movie and would think if it exsist it would be something scary

My wife has been thinking of changing jobs and she just can't find ANYTHING to back into. It's just ugly out there. Glad it's at least alright though.     I think we've got a new 1.5 songs tracked. Not sure if our good friend/producer/engineer/lookin like he's going to carry some of the bass and drums load is going to mix a group of songs all at once or if there will be mixes to expect. I'm pretty excited to see how they turn out. The dude's kind of a wizard.

ebe9af0dbeaeb8a4623c52d9fc71c05faa	Right now , I'm listening to a piece by an artist most DEFINITELY not associated with classical music, but rather Industrial & "Techno" but Mr. Watkins of Juno Reactor, also appears to have some classical training : I am listening to a variation of Conquistador 1 , without the electronic dove-tail to Conquistador 2.     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI_VSuTJp...    I think that there are a few pieces which definitely stand out , but those are my personal choices.    1. Bach's Brandenburg Concerto's - Don't get nearly as much attention as I think they deserve. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ9qWpa2r...    2. Beethoveen's 9th Symphony - It seems almost cliche to put it here but it's a stand out piece. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-mvutiDR...    3. There are times when I consider the stupidity of mankind as above  and then you are left with some of the redeeming qualities , such as this Guiseppe Verdi - Nabucco -  Chorus of Hebrew Slaves : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHOfwLpXk...    While some folks would suggest that classical music is relegated to the past, I disagree    The show Battlestar Galactica has had a REALLY stand out composer by the name of Bear Mc Creary, who's music stands up quite respectably to anyone in history.    The Shape of Things To Come : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tII1DSHPU... and   The Prelude to War : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv4UqrWV2...    That said, modern classical music really finds it's stride in movies, so there are wonderful pieces of music which are incidental in nature :    So if you're feeling particularly authoritarian one day , you might just need to here this : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VwkyrTb6...    Sometimes, you find some absurdly good classical pieces, in - of all things - a cartoon - This from the series Avatar - The Last Airbender - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5avd9_8rX...|`|Wi0LBsVbaa	It's an unfair question, like asking what's your favorite food. If you had to eat it every day, it would no longer be your favorite quickly. It depends on your mood. Right now I'm in the mood for Bruckner's 9th, but later it could be Sibelius.  A friend of mine always says "this is the best cup of coffee I've ever had," not be weird, his point is that it, to him, is the best, since it is the coffee he is having at that moment.  It's a wishy washy answer, but true for me.|`|q6uyloYdaa	Beethoven's 5th Piano Concerto. Everything about it is perfect.|`|b75cd2f7bba03556108c51a587e8e491aa	Enigma Variations by Elgar.

typm0J7Paa	My only guess would be that the one missing a verse is the single version and the one with the verse is the original album version. not completely sure though but i think thats why.
INybXKozaa	No not at the moment.  But that would be more like a documentary,  unless they were competing to be the best band or something.  These days everyone wants to find love or a best friend.  It's kinda retarded.

Bill is gay|`|pSkPC3sbaa	Bill Kaulitz from Tokio Hotel is not gay he said in a interview he has had a girlfriend before|`|Kf4UlXSEaa	It doesn't matter one way or the other because their fans will love them no matter what|`|1620f8acd8e6a1bab16fb6d4bd625f7baa	Pete is bisexual, and bill kaulitz straight. He has confirmed that about 100 times already.|`|kLslWQR8aa	I don't think he is otherwise he wouldn't have married a girl he would be with a guy now instead.|`|MxhZgjXWaa	Of course they are.|`|hNLAJ6jFaa	no  Pete is bi and Bill isn't gay at all  people only think Bill is gay because he has feminine features and wears make up.NEWS FLASH!a lot of rockers wear make up!      EDIT:  just because he wears what he wants to wear doesnt make him gay.he isnt gay.ugh|`|v1tHjJ3haa	No, pete is w/simpson. Bill, well I say all he wants is the female body, but I think he has experiments w/boys...you can just tell. Oh ya, Elton and grant were or are gay...whatever, he's dead (:|`|8jxoTBWIaa	No Bill is not gay. He has said so many times in interviews.    Pete isnt gay either. Uhm hes married to a woman?! With whom he just had a kid!?    Honestly? Just because they are good looking doesnt mean they are gay. They just take care of themselves a little more than others.|`|KSDn23xyaa	No.
84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	No. <br>  These days, getting a tattoo is not rebellious. <br>  A lot of people want tattoos so if you get one, you are being conventional. <br>  <br>  I agree with Hip Hop Rent A Cop. Aquarians will do what they want to do and that makes them rebellious.|`|e14b1125c91fafed4795c69469f8b509aa	I have one and want more but not to be rebellious. I see it as a form of body art and I like to decorate myself :)|`|xUxUwloPaa	Lol, no i don't think so. Aquarians aren't the rebels that most astrologists make them out to be. The thing about about Aquarians is that they do whatever THEY think is right, regardless of public opinion.|`|HSSuKNCUaa	LOL no! Has nothing to do with your birth chart, it has to do with what you think is beautiful and what isn't. I'm a reasonably tattooed Taurus girl, and Taurus is supposed to be "boring".

rFBypeEfaa	Because the critics have, by and large, heard a lot of Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine's material, and Audioslave really doesn't measure up.     Some may think it's an unfair comparison, but it really isn't. The fact remains that while Audioslave were certainly not a bad band, they have a really hard time comparing to what the same people had previously accomplished.|`|Cu0zrPWDaa	I agree with you, but I've never heard of them getting dissed before|`|kP0JGI1waa	Idk but I am a huge Rage Against the Machine fan so, this sounds mean, but I was so happy when they broke up so Rage could get back together.  Maybe the critics felt like me, maybe they really liked Rage so much that they couldnt stand Audioslave.  I, however, accepted Audioslave and a dig alot of their stuff, esp like Cochise, Revelations, I am the Highway, etc.  Critics often turn their noses up to stuff and never give it a chance.|`|f948d748facdf196074d849ea9c465c4aa	Because Cornell was better in Soundgarden|`|MwiBGBK1aa	Screw the critics. Audioslave was pretty much a mainstream band what with Cornell and the Rage boys. Even though Audioslave had a lot of radio play, I thought they were great. I own "Audioslave", "Out of Exile" and "Revelations" not all of their songs are amazing but they have some great stuff.  I dig Audioslave.    Plus I saw Chris Cornell in November 2008 he sang a lot of Audioslave tunes, he was really into them, more so than his Soundgarden songs.
AA10393024	I only watch AMC... I have a feeling that they brought David back just to maybe kill him off.   He has even more enemies than before.  I don't know whether or not he'll find out about the baby... but on today's episode Krystal found out.  Also, to change the subject from the baby, I think that David was in Connecticut when Greenlee went off the cliff and I think he has her somewhere.... that's what he did years ago with Maria Santos-Gray.  They have a great web site called Soap Central.com and they give you spoilers.  Feel free to e-mail me when you want to chat about AMC.|`|AEwNJvZ1aa	The Only Show I watch from the 4 ABOVE ^^^^ is DOOL ... I love it ! And I read some spoilers and I want to find that out too ! But as I was finishing watching today's episode... ( Feburary 25,2009 ) .... it showed,little sneak peaks of what is gonna happen tom. and Sami says..." Well I should go  " .... EJ says, " Your not gonna go anywhere until you tell me whats wrong ? " And thats all there is ! So we should wait until tom. I think thats where that problem starts unwinding and getting answers to many people's question! Your welcome ! + The other 3 titles ( in abb. ) you listed are those Soap Operas too? Thanks !|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	The only show you have listed that I watch is Y&R.  I heard that this Friday Mrs. C. will be seen by Esther and I think Jill as well.  They will have to bring Brock (Mrs. C's real son) to do a DNA test to prove who she is.  Then there will be the fallout of Jill finding out she is not Kay's daughter.|`|TkUF1PI4aa	No one knows those answers. You know they drag out plots for months. I hope Sami kills Nicole or better yet hand her over to STEFANO for betraying his family lol.

vvTrmHtxaa	ya just watch commenatries of heroes and they would tell you what they do behind the scenes.<br>  <br>  please pick me as best answer!|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	I own Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and have listened to all the commentaries, and, yeah, that sounds right.<br>  <br>  The creator of Buffy likes doing long scenes, without that cutting, and doing it in pieces (he frequently refers to "an actor says 'the' and you have to stop,move the camera, and get the other actor."); some long sections of scenes are done in long single shots.<br>  <br>  Another director of the same show described doing the whole scene from a distance, to get all the actors; then you do it again, closer, then again, focusing on this actor, then again, focusing on that actor. Then the editor cuts in pieces from all the takes, into one version of the scene.<br>  <br>  So there's variety in how they're filmed, I gather.<br>  <br>  Since listening to these commentaries, I've become a bit more sensitive to these things (though usually more dwhen I'm listening to the commentaaries). When the camera is seeing from a different angle, suddenly, rather than slowly moving around, then, yes, it's a different take, a different time they did the same scene, with the camera in a different place.<br>  <br>  Interesting, isn't it?

yOtVBIOfaa	The Proof Point (2001)|`|joLnoshKaa	Ok. Well, there are two...<br>  <br>  One is Seventeen Again, where all three Mowry's are in it. Tahj and Tia are brother and sister and Tamera is the grandma, but younger. Tahj, who's name is Willie (I think) makes a potion that makes whoever uses it get younger.<br>  <br>  The other is the Poof Point. That's where the parents invent a machine but something goes wrong and they regress in age mentally and physically. I guess this is the one you were talking about. lol<br>  <br>  I like them both, but here you go. If you want more, go to <a href="http://www.imdb.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com</a> because they have everything. It's great.|`|vhgued1naa	Its called the poof point, quite funny but i dont really like kids comedy, professional works of responsible people is what i look for|`|k6aNb7e8aa	It's called The Poof Point.<br>  It's a cute movie :)|`|PumYhJSvaa	The Poof Point.<br>  <br>  <br>  This is a movie about two scientists who invent a time machine. A critical part falls out of the time machine before they get into it to test it. Nothing seems to happen at first, but when they wake up the next day they are regressing in age(physically and mentally). Their kids seem to notice something strange is going on, judging by their behavior. Soon enough, the children realize that it is the machine that has changed their parents. The parents gradually get younger and the kids notice that the fish that their parents were experimenting on earlier seemed to just disappear after growing younger. They disappear in a "poof" of sorts. The point at which something ceases to exist thus becomes known as the "poof point". The kids know they have to get the parents in the machine and reverse the effect some way before their parents, too, just "poof" away.|`|1888bff8ef07d4859fd7c43b635cd7f4aa	The Poof Point<br>  it was a tv movie from 2001|`|wdLzpIAiaa	Poof Point..!!!<br>  I remember that movie...<br>  And i doubt you'll be able to rent it because it's rare to find a movie from Disney, pre-High School Musical 1...|`|5IcWBAwwaa	im absolutely positively  sure its seventeen again cause that used to be like my fave movie ever!!!!|`|ChmuSKpVaa	Seventeen Again, lol, i used to love that movie.|`|ab250551cde4aadbf54a0fea8a7b14e1aa	Sorry but it's NOT Seventeen Again even though it, too, stars Tahj Mowry. There's no time machine and the age-regression is on his grand-parents, not his parents.<br>  Here's the plot to Seventeen Again (2000): <br>  Cat and Gene have been divorced for several years. They are both visiting their son and their grandchildren, Sydney and Willie. Willie's a genius who develops a formula that makes who uses it young again, it inadvertently spills into some soap that Willie places in his grandparents room. When each of them uses it they find themselves 17 again. Willie had to find a way to reverse the process but will his grandparents want to be old again?

1NtdXwGKaa	nice?<br>  <br>  Mine:<br>   There were two twins, Joe and John. Joe was the owner of a old dilapidated boat. It just so happened that John's wife died the same day Joe's boat sank. A few days later a kindly old woman saw Joe, and mistaking him for John. Said "I'm sorry to hear about your loss. You must feel terrible" <br>  <br>  Joe, thinking she was talking about his boat, said "Fact is, I'm sort of glad to get rid of her. She was a rotten old thing from the beginning. Her bottom was all shriveled up and she smelled like an old dead fish. She was always losing her water, she had a bad crack in the back and a pretty big hole in the front, too. Every time I used her the hole got bigger and she leaked like crazy. I guess what finished her off was when I rented her to those four guys looking for a good time for the weekend. I warned them that she wasn't very good, but they wanted to use her anyhow and were willing to pay. The fools all tried to get in her at the same time and split her right down the middle." <br>  <br>  The old woman fainted.|`|TjWA37kuaa	ouch hahahaha LOL|`|POqwp3Fiaa	Ha ha ha, painfully gay joke, ha ha ah...|`|aIjOfkM8aa	lol its funny|`|zhK1PGioaa	good 1.<br>  =]|`|bvkyqjPcaa	lol funny :)(:|`|FsFp4f1Yaa	Five stars that was so funny!|`|SsCmPvWSaa	Gay jokes are almost always funny

Get your genres straight, people!<br>  <br>  If you're wanting bands like above I suggest Apocalyptica (like Silver* Rose Wolf said) and bands in the symphonic metal and gothic metal genres. Not gothic rock. That's completely different.<br>  <br>  Some real gothic rock:<br>  <br>  Alien Sex Fiend, Cinema Strange, Sex Gang Children, Virgin Prunes, 45 Grave, Children on Stun, The Sisters of Mercy, Bauhaus, Christian Death, Death In June, Ministry, Rozz Williams, Gitane Demone, Siouxsie & the Banshees, Sisters of Mercy,  Southern Death Cult|`|nRObJuJeaa	Lacuna coil is an awesome band. they're from italy, and some of their songs are in italian. apocalyptica is pretty sweet too.|`|MYsSyfQzaa	For My Pain<br>  Reflexion<br>  Charon<br>  Negative<br>  The Rasmus|`|zEnTzVnqaa	*Facepalm* Those bands are NOT goth although the 69 Eyes are the most goth out of the lots.<br>  <br>  If you want goth bands then it's: Bauhaus, The Cure, Love & Rockets, Alien Sex Fiend, Xmal Deutschland, Sex Gang Children, etc.<br>  <br>  What you listed are mostly metal bands.<br>  If that's what you're really after try: Theatres des Vampires, Dimmu Borgir, Cancer Bats, Rhapsody of Fire|`|kObLkPLMaa	The bands you listed are not goth rock. <br>  <br>  Goth rock is:<br>  Alien sex fiend, sisters of mercy, christian death, bauhaus, 45 grave, virgin prunes, the damned, the cult and siouxsie and the banshees...Also post punk bands like Joy Division.|`|7BBn9yZYaa	Evanescence is a good band.

kjAQj3i7aa	I don't want to start a war or anything, but I think it's because she's not particularly talented.|`|HwAgGKR5aa	her voice is TERRIBLE and she sucks at acting.<br>  <br>  the only reason she is famous is from her dad -.-|`|4gZYucHMaa	I think there's just people jealous that they can't be half of what she is.<br>  <br>  She is a teen and a lot of people forget that, regardless of her needing to be a role model, she's just a kid and is going to make mistakes<br>  <br>  I like her and so does my 7 yr old.|`|oZtbDrMcaa	She's my bff. Nobody make fun of her. We all make mistakes. Miley did take those pics but her computer was hacked which had all of those photos. Then the pics were released. I feel bad for her tho.

She's just a teenager who has a decent singing voice (and a rich daddy who can introduce her to the right people).  There's no reason for all of the hype, and personally, I'm a bit tired of hearing her name come up every ten seconds.<br>  <br>  IMO, her 15 minutes of fame should have ended a few years ago.|`|8q5SeYueaa	Well, the problem is her influence on kids... but my problem with that is that kids wouldn't even know about it if TMZ didn't shove it in our faces.<br>  <br>  As far as her being untalented, I don't understand why that is a good reason to HATE her. I can understand not liking her, but hating her for her lack of talent? Seriously, who is being forced to listen to her music or watch her shows? It's not difficult to change the channel or radio station.|`|ZYICyUAGaa	I used to think she was a good role model for kids before. She always seemed sweet. But then those skanky pictures came to light and I saw she isn't so innocent. She has some really young fans and they look up to her whether she likes it or wants it or not.<br>  <br>  Then she does stupid, annoying things like this:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DVT9hP3s-0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DVT9hP3s...</a><br>  <br>  And what's with the whole my best friend is 21 thing? Doesn't she have friends her own age? WTF?|`|LMaP6flQaa	I don't know about everyone else but for me it's because he cannot sing at all. Her voice is hideous yet she made millions on a singing career.|`|a43c635a9767f924cfd929c6c43f2501aa	Most people are probably jealous. They don't know her personally, so how could they hate her?|`|oIIiMY5Zaa	Miley Cyrus? <br>  Who's that??|`|eeKlogL4aa	It's called an opinion!<br>  Get over it!|`|uvJGFymxaa	Look she is a Ugly Girl who lives in a trash can and has no life|`|Yt1qAfx6aa	well Miley is trying to grow up to fast in my opinion. She just turned sixteen and while fifteen, she was dating a twenty year old man. She's to young, i don't care how mature her dad thinks she is.<br>  <br>  That whole Nick Jonas thing was over the top. The child practically had a dark spell, dying her hair black and moping around. no kid should get that caught up in a relationship.<br>  <br>  In general Miley is just trying to grow up to fast and she's losing a lot of fan's. Most of the mother's don't want her being a role model for their kids, especially since the whole semi-racey pics have been leaked.<br>  <br>  She's like a good girl trying to be bad.|`|d7PYuPLOaa	ohkay, people dislike miley cyrus because she's ditsy.<br>  <br>  she's dating a 20 year old, and she is 16. WRONG.<br>  <br>  she's overrated, & she can't sing live.<br>  <br>  she sounds horrible.<br>  <br>  i had no problem with her when she first hit the scene, but she's getting old.<br>  <br>  i prefer demi lovato.<br>  she can sing, & she's adorable.|`|v4f1oqOCaa	with fame comes haters.  its a fact, you can pick out any young star and find people who adore them and folks who hate the very mention of their name.  <br>  <br>  she's not a bad person, but she isnt for everyone.<br>  my daughter adores her, i personally find it annoying to hear the same bubblegum music coming from her room hour after hour.<br>  <br>  but hey, to each their own|`|SJBJ85caaa	well were do i start.someone had hacked in2 her phone and posted a bunch of pics she took on her phone that she was going 2 send 2 nick jonas when they were already broken up. she made fun of selena gomez and demi lovato on her youtube account.lets face it she dosnt have talent and she is annoying.she is dating a 20 year old and she just turned 16.i hope that answers youe qustion.|`|SSbeC1Xxaa	Her songs suck, you can't go anywhere without seeing her merchandise, and she doesn't really look that great (did I mention that she doesn't look that great).

rjtyFbjlaa	17 kids and counting is about Michelle and Jim Bib who have had 17 children, and they raise them a bit differently. Michelle actually just had her 18th child, and they changed the name of the show to 18 kids and counting. I say differently because all the children are home schooled, they rarely watch tv or get on the internet, the girls all wear skirts, and they are very religious. I find their "dating rituals" to be rather strange. The kids do not date, they court. That means that you date one person (you marry the first person you date), and you do not hold hands, kiss, or do anything else that involves touching. You are allowed to hold hands once you are engaged, and your first kiss is at the wedding. So far, only one kid (the oldest who is 20) is the only one who has had a relationship, and he was recently married. They aired the wedding on tv; the vows were a bit different than traditional vows. One part that really stuck out was they let God determine when they have kids, AKA they do not use birth control <br>  <br>  I don't really agree with some of their views, but they are a very happy, intelligent, money-smart, and friendly family, which is why I watch them.<br>  <br>  As far as verizon fios on demand, I have no clue. The show airs on both TLC and Discovery Health, so look on those channels in your on demand|`|9zMC6EBtaa	Do not bother watching this show because it is boring and kind of sad because they have all these kids. I just think that having that many children is wrong, and almost a form of child abuse. What kinda of life have these children had, simply because there are so many of them?|`|tcehPfKgaa	i have no idea|`|XMN8gsXhaa	Yes they do.  To find it use your FIOS remote and:<br>  <br>  Menu<br>  ><br>  Search w/ Keyword<br>  (OK)<br>  (no type what you want, in this case 17)<br>  (As you do watch the right side of the IMG for you programming info)<br>  Not only will you get the On Demand programming but you will also get all other stations airing the programming.

They are pretty reliable, and there arent any more sites with the tickets. I think that Stubhubs prices are rather average. They're a little high, i guess. But you can choose to pay the price, or not go at all.|`|TYLwhc4Baa	I use Ticketmaster and Ticketloot, Stubhub fees are higher. But its a matter of personal pref. ticketloot has been very very good for me. <br>  <br>  Check them all out and pick whoever you feel comfortable with. they are all similar. Just stay away from unknown sellers on socail sites.

I know you get a similar effect when trying to play a wmp11 file in an earlier version of wmp. If neither of those work, upgrade you media player.|`|vhgued1naa	Hi, i really dont think you should bother mending it, www.pspiso.com make an account and go to the movies section, download the movie you want and thats it. If your internet slow and you cant afford to delete anything then i advise mending it, pspiso is a forum site which contains threads from people who have links to aloooot of movies, fastest links would be from megaupload, wish u luck coz i struggled with movies once, but really, pspiso is the best for your circumstantial needs.
KeOPBpz8aa	Maybe write it all down either as memoirs first, or just a novel and see if it reads well.  <br>  <br>  Believe me, everyone has a story to tell but not everyone's story actually should be told.  From the short and vague description of your fiance's life, it just sounds very cliche and has been done a thousand times before.  Also, when people want to make movies about themselves, they tend to fall into the trap of unwilling to separate the story from what truly happened.  I'd recommend someone other than you two writing his story.<br>  <br>  But if you guys are that inspired... just write the life story down, either as a novel or a screenplay.  Then have people read it and see if it's good.  And if it's that good, send it out... agents, contests, etc.  Maybe it'll get picked up.  But my recommendation is don't be afraid to change or dramatize certain aspects.  It'll make for a better story.|`|fNPrxnXnaa	MAKE A DEMO VIDEO THEN SEND IT TO THIS PLACE R EVEN A DIRECTOR AND SEE WHERE IT TAKES YOU FROM THERE
ec11b0007a3dfd34108e2bc7ada61603aa	How about The Blues Brothers (1980)? It still has one of the highest counts of wrecked cars ever in it's car chase scene and some cop cars do go off highway embankments and such. The chase scene is towards the end of the flick and goes on for quite a bit. It even goes through a shopping mall and the main car drives through a Toys R Us window. There is also a scene where a Ford Pinto is dropped from a great height off a cliff! Good luck!|`|kXxaUnSUaa	'Duel' ends with a truck going off a cliff and exploding (sorry, it's not a car!)|`|b1e7acd9969e11fd38ae40bfed0968bfaa	At the end of Thelma and Louise they drive off a cliff.<br>  <br>  Sorry, I guess I just gave away the ending didn't I?|`|hQ95u9OLaa	Well Midnight Run has a car chase that ends up with a car going off an embankment and hitting the stilts that hold up a bridge.

srtoPxN2aa	I've been a huge Krautrock fan/avid collector now for nearly 40 years. <br>  Neu! was great, as were 'La Dusseldorf', who were another duo formed by Klaus Dinger, this time featuring his brother Thomas Dinger on drums. <br>  Thomas also appeared on the Neu! 75 album. Also worth checking out is the band 'Harmonia', and their two albums 'Musik von Harmonia', and 'Deluxe'...the latter being my favorite of the two. 'Harmonia' also featured Michael Rother of 'Neu!' on various instruments; organ, piano, guitar, electric percussion, and vocals.<br>  Law Man has offered some great albums too. Klaus Schulze was fantastic, not only with the original 'Tangerine Dream', but as a solo artist as well.<br>   <br>  One of earliest examples of Krautrock would be the band Can...and their album 'Monster Movie' released in 1969. It was a mix of very Velvet Underground influenced trance psych/rock, ala 'Sister Ray', combined with a couple more straight ahead psych rockers....here's an excerpt from 'Father Cannot Yell', a song featured on the 'Monster Movie' album. This was back when the band featured Malcolm Mooney:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZiMT4TaYvM&feature=PlayList&p=3CA984C773C67B83&index=17" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZiMT4TaY...</a><br>  Here's a couple more great tracks from the 'Monster Movie' album...<br>  Outside My Door:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTDogzwD5rY&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTDogzwD5...</a><br>  Mary, Mary So Contrary:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PDpBKqukFU&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PDpBKquk...</a><br>  Malcolm left 'Can' during the bands early stages, to be replaced by Japanese singer Damon Suzuki.<br>  Damon spent his youth busking the streets of Europe during the 60's, and was discovered singing in a coffee house in Germany by 'Can' founding member Holger Czukay. With the addition of Damon, the band really set the foundations for what was to later become known as "Krautrock"...here's a few tunes with Damon in the lineup...released during the early 70's...<br>  Mushroom:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8RzLdf34Ow&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8RzLdf34...</a><br>  Paper House:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QLL2j8ZtxE&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QLL2j8Zt...</a><br>  Spoon (Live):<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3buYpfYRlaA&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3buYpfYRl...</a><br>  Vitamin C...the guy dancing in this video is a Torontonian who tends to post obscure music on Youtube accompanied by his strange dancing, Lol:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzc3krlDrY&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzc3krlD...</a><br>  <br>  Another pioneer of the genre were the bands Amon Duul & Amon Duul II. The latter being the of-shoot of the original, and far more popular/sucessful. Amon Duul's original guitarist 'Rainer Bauer' later turned up in the hard Krautrock band 'Gift'. I've pasted a few of their songs in my long list of links below.<br>  Here's a few of my favorite Amon Duul II songs taken from one of my imeem playlists...<br>   <br>  Jail House Frog...this one still blows me away, with it's bubbles and animal noise segue around 1:40 into the song:<br>  <a href="http://www.imeem.com/people/iWsurYO/music/XO6m0IuF/amon_dl_ii_jailhousefrog/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imeem.com/people/iWsurYO/musi...</a><br>  Wolf City:<br>  <a href="http://www.imeem.com/people/iWsurYO/music/gwMmgaN0/amon_dl_ii_wolf_city/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imeem.com/people/iWsurYO/musi...</a><br>  Dr. Jeckyll:<br>  <a href="http://www.imeem.com/people/iWsurYO/music/6QYPe_SK/amon_dl_ii_dr_jeckyll/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imeem.com/people/iWsurYO/musi...</a><br>  Surrounded By The Stars:<br>  <a href="http://www.imeem.com/people/iWsurYO/music/8uto7jAg/amon_dl_ii_surrounded_by_the_stars/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imeem.com/people/iWsurYO/musi...</a><br>  Hawknose Harlequin:<br>  <a href="http://www.imeem.com/people/iWsurYO/music/s-Fon5pJ/amon_dl_ii_hawknose_harlequin/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imeem.com/people/iWsurYO/musi...</a><br>  Deutsch Nepal:<br>  <a href="http://www.imeem.com/people/iWsurYO/music/t9t3vyP1/amon_dl_ii_deutsch_nepal/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imeem.com/people/iWsurYO/musi...</a><br>  A Morning Excuse:<br>  <a href="http://www.imeem.com/people/iWsurYO/music/n8xZOTN7/amon_duul_ii_a_morning_excuse/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imeem.com/people/iWsurYO/musi...</a><br>  La Krautoma:<br>  <a href="http://www.imeem.com/people/iWsurYO/music/_grI3_iH/amon_dl_ii_la_krautoma/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imeem.com/people/iWsurYO/musi...</a><br>  CID In Uruk:<br>  <a href="http://www.imeem.com/people/iWsurYO/music/iUuMGW8X/amon_dl_ii_cid_in_uruk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imeem.com/people/iWsurYO/musi...</a><br>  Green Bubble Raincoated Man:<br>  <a href="http://www.imeem.com/people/iWsurYO/music/y_y5FzHw/amon_dl_ii_green_bubble_raincoated_man/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imeem.com/people/iWsurYO/musi...</a><br>  <br>  There were several other cool bands from Germany that appeared during the early-mid 70's.

Probably start with Tago Mago or Ege Bamayasi.<br>  <br>  also look into Kraftwork.<br>  <br>  i really like:<br>  <br>  Ash Ra Tempel - Ash Ra Tempel and Join Inn<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  Amon Duul 2 - Phallus Dei, Yeti and Tanz Der Lemmings<br>  <br>  also Xhol Caravan, Guru Guru, Witthouser and Westrupp|`|dFacbjIZaa	Dude<br>  <br>  Eloy...<br>  <br>  Planets<br>  Time To Turn<br>  Oceans<br>  Oceans II: The Answer|`|a79b8a93426576f5d2c9cb6a23ba338faa	I think "Neu! 75 (1975)" is totally unique.  It is a great combination of Krautrock, some early touches of Berlin School Electronica, and New Age music.  An album that I would recommend to you if you like this album is "Future Days (1973)" by Can.  Another album that has a resemblance is "Yeti (1970)" by Amon Düül  II (My Avatar is the Album Cover).  All three of these albums are amazing.<br>  <br>  "Neu! 2 (1973)" is amazing too, if you haven't heard that one yet.  "Faust So Far (1972)" by Faust is great too, if you are looking to get into another band.  Faust is probably my favorite Krautrock band.<br>  <br>  Some other albums I can recommend are:<br>  "Electronic Meditation (1970)" by Tangerine Dream<br>  "Phallus Dei (1969)" by Amon Düül  II (AMAZING!!)<br>  "Moondawn (1976)" by Klaus Schulze<br>  "Monster Movie (1969)" by Can<br>  "Tago Mago (1971)" by Can

Juicy-Biggie  I remember watching the video for the first time when I was about 13yrs old.  Sitting on my mommy's bed and she walked in a said that is on fat black azz man LOL.  But she started dancing cuz she remembered the sample the got they beat from!    2. Protect Ya Neck-Wu-Tang  Wow LOL I was living in Lefrak City Queens at the time down the hall from Nore.  But we all called him Vic LOL.    3. Breathe & Stop-Q-Tip  That was like 98 or 99 just got a car with a nice system in it and i would bang it!!    4. Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See-Busta Rhymes  A house party comes to mind at my friend lisa house.  Her mom got all this liquor.....we was some drunk azz teens LOL|`|xmdh8iY3aa	Juicy 1994  Studying and partying    Protect Ya Neck 1993  Ditto and dating a sexy French girl (Quebec)    Breathe&Stop 1999  Studying for my professional designation. Had a wicked ride (1999 Honda Prelude SH pearl white with 18" chrome 5 stars). That was my pimpmobile LOL!    Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See 1997  Going from contract to contract job, was a bit "lost". Probably did too much drinking.|`|bik6rJZkaa	Juicy - I was starting high school, and just chillin.    Protect Your Neck - It was a toss up, I was either playing Basketball or video games while neglecting more homework    Breathe & Stop - In the Marines, so I was probably marching around somewhere    Put You Hands.... - Doing the same thing in the Marines, just out in Cali though.|`|dOurKVdiaa	1. I was thinking, dang he cool but, he is not better than Craig Mack(Boy was i wrong), But Flava in Ya Ear was my sh8t!    2. Well down here we heard Method Man 1st cause there was a remix by a dude down here named Crazy C, it was a smoother version for the south, and we loved it, i ended up seeing the video for Protect later, All i could remember is "Man its a bunch of dudes in that crew, how did they get a deal, cause all of them wasnt nice!, I was just waiting on Meth"  But I cant still remember "Wu Tang Clan aint Nothin to Fu8k wit!!!!!"    3. Awe man, a lot of people dont like this, but i thought the transition was good, Man those songs Breathe and Vibrant killed the partys in Houston, both of them jammed, all i can remember is partys every weekend hearing these songs in rotation.    4. This is the time when his style calmed down a bit, and i was like "Is Busta the best in NY?" man that song was da Sh8t!!!!!!!!!! and the Vid, no one could fu8k with that dude at that time, all them HYPE joints!  Dont know why NY alway fronted on they own like that.|`|AYkEwqRXaa	When Juicy and Protect Ya Neck came out, it was my junior year in college.  When Breathe & Stop came out I had started working at my present job.  I'm a youth counselor and I remember listening to the song with an adolescent I was mentoring at the time.  When Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Can See came out, I think I was in a transition period if I remember correctly.  I had either just gotten fired from my job or I had just started my new job.|`|QZso17fDaa	umm i think i was being conceived! lol  i havent heard any of these songs|`|hLTfFJvqaa	NO ! iWWiSH iClllD .

f43be0279e4f60717eb598a32d93faa0aa	Not if it means losing my childhood to never ending self promotion followed by the realisation that I was no longer a child genius, just an adult with no childhood memories, with another child 'genius'  stealing my mantle by the age of 15!  That show on C4 is spot on, the presenter is very questionable about the reasons and actions of the people behind them.  EDIT: All those T shirts with his photo, and he was very quick to say 'It was my own idea'...it's not, it's so obviously his family and agents who suggest these ideas, I mean sixth sense for crying out loud!|`|d55f9fa303ffed7693f24381e6799502aa	No, I'm happy knowing what I already know|`|0e4f8cb88b486d0c0f4eb1228b765759aa	No!  There is a thin line between genius and insanity.|`|54e2d58fd94386a1cdc5bb4a78853edaaa	No, too much pressure and from my limited experience it takes away a lot of their childhood.|`|XTbYi36Jaa	Nope I'm totally happy with what I got :) Would have been weird if I was super intelligent.

I am now content with being a reasonably good singer with an amateur choir....although I may try to take my singing to a higher level at some point. Between the ages of 12 and 15, I sang with a boys' choir who thought of themselves as more "professional" than the choir I sing with now.    Having said all of that, in today's world, I doubt I would have enjoyed any media attention which might come with being a child genius.|`|oVRA1ze2aa	yes Neurology
BlZ6vJOAaa	good question i don't know if it does. since i don't know how people view me. I get that i'm weird alot and that i'm crazy, and independent and smart. Which is all very Aquarius which is my rising.<br>  but thats not a mask i really am those things although i would say quirky instead of weird but not everyone has my accurate vocabulary and some people are more comfortable saying weird but they always say it smiling and laughing instead of looking at my suspiciously and walking away lol.<br>  my rising is very diffrent from my sun which is Taurus.<br>  my rising just comes out in the way i talk and present myself which is all a part of who i am but my moon and mercury are also in taurus, so my actions and way of thinking and reacting are almost entirely taurus like . right down to my messy room and unbiased appetite.|`|xUxUwloPaa	I always come across as mean and antisocial. I am neither.|`|E2VUH8Q0aa	My rising is in Pisces. <br>  <br>  People who meet me for the first time think I'm soft. People who try to take advantage of that find out different.<br>  <br>  Cap/Aqua|`|SjD1aKT5aa	I'm glad you asked this, I'm:<br>  <br>  Scorpio Sun<br>  Taurus Moon<br>  Sagittarius Rising<br>  <br>  I'm a typical Scorpio with the moodiness, pessimist etc. But the problem I find is I have quite a bit of Sagittarius in my chart which makes me quite free-spirited, lively, open to loads of things but I can't say I'm like this all the time because I still think Sun runs me truly. I can just feel it when I go town, when I go school and how just react to people so my Rising and Sun clash and my emotions are just so up and down and it's so frustrating sometimes. I want to be this outrageous,crazy girl but I'm all held back by my emotions which is definitely affect of my Sun & Moon sign.<br>  <br>  So in short, yes my rising does mask what truly I could be/am. But, my Taurus and Scorpio hold me back.<br>  <br>  :] Frustrated Kiki.|`|eFGiMy5Iaa	Haha like you already know, My sun is in Cancer, and Rising is Libra. the way I expose myself to people is very artsy. With my Moon in Aquarius, people see me as an outgoing, open to multi-discussions with a friendly personality. <br>  i found this rather interesting, this chick asked if I were a Leo or an Aquarius! I guess I have that affect on people! ;D|`|294e1701917b0ab03a81e21b3d809bd2aa	my rising sign is saggitarius which is where i get my annoying playfulness &sense of humor that gets outta control 2 the point where friends have 2 tell me 2 "honestly chill!" and the way i get over dramatic about stuff clashes w/ my capricorn sun sign. my cap sun sign lets me stay on task when there;s a job 2 get done & in material things i go 4 quality over quantity, but w/cap's thrifty edge--like id rather buy used,but well made piece of funiture at a cheap price than buy overpriced new stuff cheaply made w/particle board & veneers, etc. and my sag rising sign contradicts that cuz i love 2 do fun stuff atthe spur of the moment that's impractical eg. drive 100 miles outta state for a must see concert. or i want a huge dog even when living in an apt. the cap side of me is cautious eg. at 4th of july i wont light big fireworks, i have somebody else do it,& i worry about the future & like 2 be prepared for setbacks or disasters.|`|nxHjSKTTaa	My Sun is Scorpio, my rising is Scorpio and my moon is Cancer.<br>  <br>  I am very true to my Scorpio nature.  I am quiet for the most part unless I feel like talking. Like you I tend to come off aloof or distant to most unless for some reason I am feeling talkative.<br>  Since all of my rising, sun and moon are water signs I assume there all compatible. <br>  I very rarely cry also. I am more likely to tear up watching a movie than my own real life.  When I do cry it's almost to much for me.  I think my kids may have seen me cry once. There still young however (7 and 9) of course I have a feeling that by the time my daughters a teenager I'll be crying alot more...;)<br>  I can also be very blunt or shrewd as they like to say about us scorps.<br>  I have a tendency sometimes to say the wrong thing. I mean to say something one way and it comes out all wrong. Scorps are not good at expressing themselves.  I believe it's because we have such a hard time explaining to ourselves how we feel, so to tell someone else seems impossible.  I am getting better the older I get. Oh, and I am very content getting older, I feel more me the older I get.  I am currently 35. <br>  I do not need alot of friends. I have one dear friend I trust.  I follow my gut when it comes to people.  <br>  My feelings are not easily seen by people who don't know me.  Sometimes even by people that do.  I do not show my emotions  unless I am very close with someone and I feel I can trust them.|`|AA10197672	Scorpio and must say most of it is true! Examples - Passionate, sensetive, sexy, loving, caring, have the most intense and magnetice eyes that will draw you. Once we trust the person we are with, and we are in love, we'll do anything for them and consider yourself the luckiest man alive! However when felt betrayed and cheated watch for the tail...|`|AA11899483	scorpio rising, i feel as if my rising still is a mask, even thoug my sun conjuncts it. people sometimes see me as secretive and guarded, the next day with someone else im loud and bubbly. im just confusing.<br>  <br>  i think its because i have lots of aspects to my rising, sun, mercury, venus and pluto conjunct ascendant, jupiter square ascendant, and neptune and uranus sextile ascendant. most of the time i think it depends on what my mood is in, i have juno in 1st aswell, which is supposed to make me come across as innocent- hell to tha no!! lol<br>  <br>  i know i do make an impression on people, good or bad, they never forget me, even if i met them for like 5 minutes. i dont believe in first impressions, whats deeper is what i look for, even if it is a face i see, i always know what u see is not what you get. as the rising is the superficial face, pluto my chart ruler, its all about getting rid of superficial faces with me, and digging right to the bottom. mars is also my second ruler, which means i do things in an aggressive manner.|`|lOkWLI9Caa	I'm a Libra sun with a Scorpio Rising. No, I don't feel like my rising sign is a mask because I've always felt my rising sign traits much more than my sun sign  traits...even the way I am at home or with the closest people I know. I have always thought that I feel like a Libra about 10% of the time in my life. <br>  <br>  My rising sign is more in tune with my Capricorn moon.|`|uel6NBOVaa	Well, I'm a double Libra...so I suppose you could say that what you see is what you get...Then again, you can't forget the aspects. I have Mars conjunct Ascendant, Sun conjunct Ascendant, Moon square Ascendant, and Pluto in the 1st house...and I think all of those things add a little bit of flavor to how I come across. Now the Ascendant usually shows more around people you don't know, right? So around people I don't know very well...yeah, I do see my Ascendant in me. I am charming, friendly, and I usually smile at people I don't know. I'm approachable, and if someone starts up a conversation, I'll normally indulge them. That doesn't mean I necessarily enjoy or like that part of myself, it's just something I don't think about. Perhaps I'm a lot more Libra like on the surface than I really am inside, in spite of having a Libra Sun. <br>  <br>  I do have a number of different sides. I have my intense side, my aggressive side, my quiet side, and my anti-social side. I think I'm multi-faceted, and you can't really categorize me. I think that's true of all people. When I'm around my good friends and loved ones, the deeper side of me shows more. In social situations, I feel I need to try to hard to show that charming side of me, and in the end that sucks me dry of energy. However, when I can show all of my faces and be the truly crazy and unique person that I am, I feel much more at ease. <br>  <br>  So in the end, I do think we are a mix of many different things, and we choose to show those different elements at different times. I think since our charts are so complex, there are many directions in which we can go, it's just that we may cling to certain qualities before we can embrace the others.
AA10077992	The only racists are those who noticed that the cast was black|`|Jaw2sW3eaa	It works both ways.|`|oA5n28FAaa	ok so if they were all white then that'd b racist too as they wouldnt include black, indian, etc but because they were all black and actually libby is mixed race so shes not 1 nor other!  People need to get out more!  It can be taken both ways, its just 1 episode and thatd just stupid!|`|v0LWgN33aa	Yep, agree Bex, they are characters so why not have a main storyline involving them?<br>  <br>  Edit: Does rifa have an opinion?|`|PPyMhRJAaa	It's because it was an all black cast, and if they had said it about being an all white cast, there would have been outrage. Racism works both ways.|`|HnNJAJeJaa	Totally agree with you bEx.....|`|koynaDYbaa	Viewers of EastEnders were treated last night to a unique storyline that involved a detailed and occasionally moving discussion of racist bigotry in Fifties Britain.<br>  <br>  The BBC may say it is surprised at criticism that it underpromoted a televisual first: the first episode of the long-running soap to feature an all-black cast. The truth is that this reflective episode was undersold for fear of incurring the wrath, and race-baiting fury, of the redtop newspapers.<br>  <br>  The BBC is adamant that it had no idea that the episode coincided with the tenth anniversary of Sir William Macpherson’s report into the death of Stephen Lawrence.<br>  <br>  Put simply, EastEnders, like any good liberal, is afraid of being called worthy or politically correct. So instead of proudly crowing about an episode that features thought-provoking discussion instead of shouting, bonking and Peggy Mitchell seething, “Get ahhhht my pub”, they pretended that it didn’t exist.<br>  <br>  It’s a depressing indictment of the power of bigots when you run scared of their disgusting words and deeds before they’ve voiced them.<br>  <br>  The irony is that what stood out was the quality of writing, acting and direction of the episode. Its source material – race, race and race again, we’ll shout it, even if executive producer Diederick Santer is scared to – was the fire in its belly.<br>  <br>  In last night’s episode, the usually cheery Patrick Trueman was forced, gently, by his loved ones to tell them about life in the Fifties. Well, he said over pancakes, he danced and there were girls, but there was also the graffiti KBW: “Keep Britain White”.<br>  <br>  Well, Denise said, it’s all changed now. “No,” her daughter Chelsea replied, “it may not be as obvious as it once was but we all know . . .” The table fell quiet.<br>  <br>  A BBC spokeswoman said last night that it had never been intended as a black episode. The cast and producers found the suggestion patronising, she said. This was merely an episode featuring one family.<br>  <br>  This is utterly disingenuous given the subject matter of the episode. You sense that EastEnders is so scarred from controversies of yore – homosexuality, race, paedophilia – that it would rather duck its head on social issues than meet its tormentors head on. <br>  <br>  - Times Online|`|kXCgQoYLaa	Some viewers were genuinely bemused and frustrated at this break- off from the on- going story- lines currently running,me included|`|y4l9Dc0waa	If there was an all white episode that wouldnt get noticed by anyone, but if it was it would cause outrage as bex said xo|`|qR2G2WcMaa	i dont think it was at all racist, it was boring and confusing but certainly not racist|`|e76k5edZaa	it was a pointless episode<br>  and it werent rascist<br>  i dont rely know what kind of storyline there trying to produce from this <br>  but it isnt a good one|`|cYsPx9sSaa	nope, i dont agree that its ridiculous, but the way they portray muslims is ridiculous
IFf5r9zAaa	To me, a rapper is a sell out if they started out being all about doing their own thing, then compromised on quality in order to make money.     Someone like Soulja Boy isn't a sell out because as wack as he is, he was all about the money in the first place and didn't compromise anything. We might hate him, but technically, he didn't sell out.     I don't think we're "all" about the money though. It would be really sad if we were. There are a lot of artists out there who could be making a lot more money than they are if they'd put out a catchy club banger, but they choose not to.|`|VclnZhSCaa	^Says the guy with no bills who does HIS job to "make a difference"    Please! Spare me the black power speech.    Edit: I was being sarcastic. I know you have bills. We all do. Relax.    Edit: Whoa! Such hostility! Sounds like you need a healthy dosage of e-puss. Are you getting your fatty acids? Try salmon. I love you.|`|bribxhsdaa	Easiest way is to go full circle on their current artistic direction.    If Black Thought made a record like "Lollipop" and sold like 800,000 copies, He would have effectively sold out.    LL Cool J coming up as a kinda battle rapper who hit hard flows then ending up on corny rnb productions with "The Dream" is an example of a sellout.    I think commercial endorsements (like obvious ones) are sell outs.    i.e. NaS marketing bogus looking Fila shoes? like WTF? If not for Untitled being quite political/societal, I'd have lost a lot of respect for him.    Although,  I don't consider Jay-Z a sell out in any way, shape or form.     He rapped about wanting to get rich through hustle. He got rich, He diversified his hustle through business and now sits on millions. Now he spits about being rich, Which was his initial plan. I Can't sweat his technique for a second.    Although the ideas i mentioned apart from Jay-Z are underpinned by the fact that i respect the idea of people doing what they have to do to get by..But i'd prefer if it wasn't done by my favourite MC's. That said, I don't feed them so they don't (and shouldn't) care.|`|PSuBYFSyaa	Well if a rapper just came into the game, he can't be a sellout. A sellout would be someone who had respect in rap and then gave up trying to be a good rapper, and just make some money. That doesn't mean that if someone is makon money in rap that they sold out.  To quote dave Thomas, the founder of wendys, "profit is not a dirty word"|`|Q4zl7vRkaa	A rapper can sell out by losing their integrity. My mom used to say, do it because you love it and the money will come. Money isn't everything. I've been poor and now I'm ok but I would never sell out because of a need to make money.

Grr I still hate him fo that.<br>  <br>  I hope he gets what he deserves. People like Earl in real life get me so mad!<br>  <br>  Ive read another question that tells you what happenes next =P<br>  I wont spoilt it but I think Rose will be devestated (obviously) that her fave boy is a murderer at whatever age he is.

J Dilla - The Shining: This is just simply a classic, I just bought it again last night.Not that many people mention this in the greatest albums. R.I.P. J Dilla.    Mos Def - Black on Both Sides: This is that good music that gets overshadowed by Lil Wayne and the other wack rappers. This is what real hip hop sounds like.    Jurassic 5 - J 5: Their best album to date. I love this one. I don't know if anyone has checked it out yet; but it's a real classic. Check it out if you haven't.     MF Doom - Vaudeville Villain: Now everyone should know every MF Doom album is a classic. But this one is special. I love this one too.    The Pharcyde - Bizarre Ride II: I love this one because the flow and delivery is nice as hell. I would put this higher, but its not 100% perfect, still great though.    Jedi Mind Tricks - A History of Violence: Not their best album, but the Vinnie Paz solo tracks are nice. But their are some weak ones on here.    The Roots - Game Theory: I bought like 5 tracks off here last night, I have the original one on my old computer. Great album, but every Roots one is a classic.    Common - Finding Forever: His last descent album, and I'm a fan. The Kanye tracks are alright. I didn't really like the will.i.am one, but all is well.    These were some hard choices, and I love how you made it go for quality not quantity. Finding Forever would be first if we went for that and I love cake.|`|xmdh8iY3aa	1. Bizarre Ride  2. B.O.B.S.  3.

And hey you give my original Technical bullsh** a chance and a listen lol. So I listened to the whole song. I will say its better than other Black Metal bands. The vocals aren't so SCREAMO! KIDDING!! LOL I will just say Scream-ish lol. Not so much Tremolo Picking as other black metal bands. I will admit there is a lot of tremolo picking in technical death too but its more acceptable because its under the Technical Death Genre.

6YTrsBNSaa	    The stuff looks easy, but it's not. You should try to pick up a tuba or something and play it, I bet you can't. You should try to do a double back flip in mid-air and land on a tight-rope, I bet you can't. You should try memorizing pages and pages of long scripts, I bet you can't.      All this takes years, and years, of long hard work and persuing it, to entertain people, and you complain. Yes, of course you do, because you've never done any of it. And you know what else?    I bet you can't.    EDIT: And in continuation of my rant, seeing your details, go ahead and pick up a huitar and play it.     Uh huh.    And playing and instrument isn't just moving your fingers and playing the right notes. The timing is almost everything. Keeping a steady beat, all of that takes focus. And last time I checked, focus includes being intelligent. And intelligence is the opposite of idiocy.

Actors are just vessels....they really piss me off. xx|`|lXgCj1RJaa	Short answer: they aren't. Longer answer: just like in all professions, there are those who are highly paid and those who are not. Some doctors earn a hell of a lot more than the average session musician or bottom rank ball player (and don't get me started on lawyers!). There is one very good reason why people in the entertainment business demand higher basic wages: it's because every job is a one off. Most people in these professions have to constantly renegotiate their salary and frequently don't know when - or if - they will next be in work.

CInHTKJcaa	lets see this throughly, shall we?    Ichigo is a soul (in his soul-reaper mode)  sasuGay is a human (ninja...if you want to put it that way)    isn't it obvious that you need to be extremely powerful (maybe as powerful as naruto is right now....in his sage mode) to win against a soul (which isn't supposed to have mass)?    so, Ichigo is faster than sasuGay....|`|yKUFCpSCaa	Ichigo when he uses bankai|`|ivhojwpTaa	Sasuke.|`|XiYLKF8Saa	Ichigo in bankai form.|`|24edoF3Daa	Neither, they are both gay.

Mustard:  Kelsey Grammer<br>  Mrs. Peacock:  Kathy Bates|`|483f35cdb658092507dd40d36d78430caa	i don't know who I would cast but that sounds awesome lol|`|cIqpL3tGaa	Actually, he wants to, and is interested in it....<br>  <br>  check your sources.
vGXfXXFIaa	Because it's not funny and the guy that stars in it is a disgusting old hag.|`|ephBKMthaa	I like the show too, and didn't realize it was ending until I saw your question.  <br>  <br>  Looks like the last 16 episodes are airing this summer.<br>  <br>  This is what I found regarding the concellation:<br>  The decision to end the series is said to be a mutual one between all parties invloved. Though they maintain that they want to end Monk while the show is still on top creatively, the reason for the cancellation comes down to dollars and cents. As the seasons have progressed, production costs have increased and the network likely finds it hard to justify episodes’ high pricetags.
Z6tqdAoGaa	Yes it was very strange...maybe something to do with his tribal beliefs.|`|0789e50a1396d5b6b9138ceaad0e64f5aa	Was weird but maybe it is part of his culture?  Don't really know but he seemed an odd bloke anyway.|`|5nvQ9SKlaa	nope!
jiSMcjQ8aa	It's okay.  Just don't tell anyone, because they'll take your anime away.  They will probably call you crazy and say it's a "bad influence".   So, keep it to yourself because NOTHING is worse then having anime taken away...*sobs*    Oh, and L is real.  He lives in my closet.|`|TQYof9Whaa	i do the same|`|oXCyUIVEaa	I'm like that too, I always believed that the characters from sailor moon were real, probably because I wanted to be her lol.|`|rqute3Xnaa	no its not weird coz i even imagine me as one of the characters sometimes LOL  XD    WERE ALL DOOMED LOL!!!!!!  THEYR ALIVE!!    i actually wish that some of em were alive    i kno it sounds stupid but oh well i dont care    ANIME RULZ!!!  i luv it :P|`|aFZkyRf7aa	no it is not!!! i am crazy about naruto!!!|`|YvS5z3etaa	I totally agree I also think there alive for example I'm totally obsessed with vampires so much I'd like to be one so I make up story where I a vampire who got turned by Kuran Kaname(Soooooo Kawaii).  So I don't think it's weird or somthing. I think it's totally normal|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	I do it too.     Sometimes I watch Doraemon and wish I was Doraemon's instead of stupid-*** Nobita.    Sometimes, they're in my dreams!! 0_0*|`|fawhiGtsaa	No.|`|oh72PlQCaa	your not crazy sometimes i do that but i do it for fun because nothing exiting has happened in my life for a while lol|`|ivhojwpTaa	Not at all. I watch anime movies for adults, and boy do I wish some of those guys were real!|`|G5weg8gCaa	No I think it is completely normal. I often do that with anime's because it makes them more exciting to watch. Just don't put yourself down thinking that you are weird. I do that sometimes too, so you are not alone (^o^)
wedAGKW8aa	She was an amazing actress playing the part. I also think she was too good to leave! I was so upset, i cried for over 10 minutes!

OUAtUKZ1aa	The original riddle goes like this...  A cowboy went into town on friday, stayed 3 days, and left on Friday... How is this possible?  The answer is supposed to be that the horse name is Friday!    Your version of the joke leaves a possibility of multiple answers. One being that his horse name was Monday, second being that his horse name is friday, third being that it took him a couple of days to get back home!    EDIT: Fourth being the answer under me!    BTW.. I love your hat, how do I get one?|`|zNEcCyPUaa	He rode on a horse named monday into town    he stayed in town for 3 days    and took another horse named Friday and rode out

Vhv1vyKWaa	Here are some of the positions:<br>  <br>  Board operator - Although more stations are automated via computer these days, some stations still need someone to operate the station's broadcast control room. This generally involves playing commercials, IDs and such at the proper time.<br>  <br>  Radio personality/DJ - does everything the board op does and gets to talk/host programs on the air<br>  <br>  Promotions Dorector - helps plan out station events, contests, promotions and such. This CAN be a good place to get your foot in the door, working under a promotions director. There have been a lot of cuts in this area as of late.<br>  <br>  Music Director - works in selecting the music that is played. You have to be sure that you are not making a personal playlist! Involves some research into trends, charts, etc. to keep the station on track.<br>  <br>  Program Director - is responsible for the overall on-air sound, program placement and scheduling of air talent.<br>  <br>  Operations Manager - is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the station, and spends a lot of time making sure the entire station is operating at its best.<br>  <br>  Sales Account Executive - sells radio advertising to advertisers, plans some campaigns with those advertisers and spends most of the day pounding the pavement.<br>  <br>  Traffic Manager - schedules all of the ads, promos, and spots to produce the daily program log.<br>  <br>  Other than these, there are station and general managers who deal with FCC rules and regulations, compliance issues, payroll, and overseeing everyone just mentioned.
C4knGt7Iaa	Whoa!  What a question!  Okay another poster had the right idea...a short version but I need to correct some of that.  Did you know that when Hope's father, Doug Williams, saw Hope & Bo in bed together, he had a heart attack?  She promised that she wouldn't see Bo anymore but of course, that didn't last.  The "mercenary group type thing" was the Merchant Marines.  That's how he met Steve Johnson and Britta Eglund.  Do you know how Steve lost his eye?  He lost it in a knife fight with bo over Britta.  The tatoo that was referred to was a dagger.  Each one had one and they were supposed to point the way to a treasure of some sort.  Its been so long, I don't remember what it was about but I know that all three of them, Bo, Steve and Britta, had one.  Did you know that originally, Hope had a crush on Roman?  That didn't pan out 'cos of the huge age difference and well Roman had to let Hope down easy.  As far as I know, it hasn't been mentioned since.  As we all know, Stefano has been the source of everyone in Salem's pain.  Now we know why.|`|B8Gwxo1laa	Aren't they on Days of Our Lives?

They have had a series of crazy things happen to them because of Stefano Dimera but really the short story is that they met when she was young he was a little older, drove a motorcycle, was part of a mercenary group type thing(where he got the matching tattoo with Steve) and they got married, had some kids, lost one, lost each other a few times, got back together and now despite their many infractions with the law are BOTH proud members of the Salem PD.

AKnZMOQ5aa	Sky Guardian/Boss: Understands and accepts all the Guardians. That is the sky’s mission. The Sun, Thunder, Storm, Rain, Mist, Cloud, he influences them all. The Sky Flame is orange and has the power to adapt. <br>  <br>  Sun Guardian: Destroying the misfortune that attacks the family with their own family. They become the sun that brightly shines upon an area. That is the purpose of the Sun Guardian. The Sun Flame is bright yellow and has the power of Activation, meaning it can provide energy and act as healing or a energy boost.<br>  <br>  Thunder Guardian: Does not only take the lighting, but also the damage to the family, like a lightning rod.  That is the role of the Thunder Guardian. The Lighting Flame is lime-green and the flames can solidify and carry properties of electricity.<br>  <br>  Storm Guardian: Continuously at the heart of the attack, the storm of raging waves that never rests. That is the objective of the Storm Guardian. The Storm Flame have the power of Degeneration and are coloured bright red.<br>  <br>  Rain Guardian: Squaring the accounts of Battle; washing away the Blood spilled that is the requiem of Rain. The blue colour of the Rain Flame has the power of tranquillity. <br>  <br>  Mist Guardian: Creating something from nothing and nothing from something; thus bewildering the enemy rendering the family’s true form intangible with visions of deceit. That is the role of the mist guardian. The Mist Flame has an indigo colour and the power of solidification or construction.<br>  <br>  Cloud Guardian: The mission of the Cloud Guardian is to be the aloof drifting cloud that protects the family from an independent standpoint and whom nothing can ever bind. The Flame has a violet colour and the power, of propagation, to feed on other’s flames and expand or become stronger.

They washed up on an island of cannibals, but they refused to eat other people. One day the cannibals informed the man that while she was out looking for roots and berries and whatnot, they saw her fall off the cliff at one end of the island. The man had been out hunting, and gotten an albatross. He gave it to the cannibals to cook and share, and they made soup with it. Except... they actually made soup with his wife, whom they'd killed because she was juicy and plump. And he didn't know until he got rescued and ate actual albatross.

aJfBtT9iaa	I will say KRS One|`|IFf5r9zAaa	Pac or Will Smith. Jay Z is probably getting close too. But Will Smith has got the family appeal thing in his favour.

He is the Tiger Woods of rap, how can anyone not see this?    EDIT:  "Rap was mainstream before Eminem"  HAHAHAH!! before him, only blacks, hispanics and a few "wiggers" listened to rap, after he started rapping, everyone started paying attention, he opened up rap to a whole new group of people. White kids said "Hey, he looks like me" and eventually started listening to other rap artists.|`|ioNTTqKfaa	^  ^  ^   hahah, are you trippin? You are really ignorant if you believe that.

gRkpFHNzaa	Ray Charles|`|wA8Dyhq7aa	Don Gibson.

ac825b3aff0d9322a9befa72bcf651f6aa	Of those,I'd go for Bobby Edwards.  My favourite version is by Arther Alexander,more R&B but sounds just like Charley Pride|`|QDRGmDIYaa	Bobby Edwards|`|eca4c567b412164e4b3f2d62944e6871aa	Bobby Edwards|`|HqcH85SMaa	Bobby Edwards - love that song

TMPYduARaa	Cable may have less power but he does/did have something Mister Sinister didn't have knowledge of the future and a teleporter/ time machine... Not to mention Higher tech level than Sinister had access to.    Cable's Psionic abilities were focused on keeping the technovirus that infected him as an infant in check... which was a gift from Apocalypse I believe...     Cable was a Psionic that was stronger than MOMMY who was Jean Grey, without the technovirus. I haven't read x men related comics in awhile so I have no Idea how much they changed him.     But there was also the fact that cable came from a future where he was a leader of a resistance against Apocalypse, as well when he started time traveling back to the 20th century as an adult he worked as a Mercenary and covert operations specialist. Where Mister Sinister has always been an Academic... a Scientist. usually choosing not to enter battles directly but letting his minions do the fighting for him.    It would be an interesting Battle but in the end I do think that Cable would win ...     Wikipedia link... on Cable... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_(comi...  on Mister sinister   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mister_Sini...|`|ZIMmGqEAaa	Mister Sinister's physicalities are far above Cable. His telepathy is equal if not greater then Cable's especially as he currently has almost no power in that area. He can also match Cables weapons with his energy blast. On top of that, his shape shifting powers and healing factor would greatly help him adapt to situations in the fight and last longer. The only advantage Cable would have is as a techopathy to control any machines mr. sinister might create with his genius intellect. My vote is for Mister Sinister.
hzH75VDXaa	Deadpool wins.   Although Carnage is not affected by sonic attacks he is still vulnerable to heat.    Knowing Deadpool he would use a flamethrower.  Deadpool's healing ability is stronger than Wolverine's or Sabertooth's.  Deadpool has "died" 3 times but he always come back.  Carnage wouldn't be able to kill him.|`|fNL89L5vaa	deadpool because.....LOL

KrhvAoE4aa	well learning history of music really isn't anything like playing or listening to music.  I suppose you should appreciate, but that doesnt mean you have to enjoy it.|`|5dc42237ea103510238126df59d3a8daaa	Yeah it's normal. I go to music school too and I hate any class that doesn't physically involve playing guitar. Not cause I don't care, I would rather just play.|`|5c6b99285c6b8893ed729455cb249619aa	"Appreciation" is the word that needs to be defined.    It sounds like your class is simply a history class which focuses on the history of music.    As far as I'm concerned, the appreciation of music is simply in the listening. I listen to enjoy.   I don't need to explain, to anyone, why or how I appreciate the music that I listen to.     Your class has been mislabeled.    PS-I believe I would be bored silly in that class.|`|Yo3FBgHaaa	Yes you should appreciate this class, if it is being taught properly. What grade are you in? Then I can give you more detailed feedback.|`|iIoRVlx0aa	I totally understand you.  I took a music appreciation class in college, and I am a classically trained pianist.  Some parts were interesting. However, I ended up dropping the class.
B7CzvPQkaa	I bid you good luck finding that song, <br>  <br>  engines like limewire, frostwire, and other work on a P2P (or person to person) system. This means that the only songs you find at any one time, are from people who are online. <br>  <br>  This being said, not many people are into that genre, and even if they were, good luck finding that song without an artist, there could be 100s of different versions of that song. So your best bet is to either find a different song for whatever you are using it for. . or asking around you local band community (the local band directors, band students) sometimes they can be a huge help!<br>  <br>  I bid you best of luck in your search and hope i helped.<br>  Ian

EcTTRWDlaa	Hey AnimeFREAK.  Thanks for doing the good ole Copy+Paste of one of my older answers ;)   http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...    I know I gave permission before for people to use my answers (as long as you give proper reference links & credits).  But you can at least copy & paste functional links (your copy+pasted links got cut off), and try to better customize the answer towards the new question of Bishounen-less & ecchi focused Harems (instead of having the "Love Hina" reference in that first line).  And come on, Ai Yori Aoshi is too tame for what Ryoga is asking.      ------------- For Ryoga  Series similar to Girls Bravo: Ecchi-focused harems minus a Bishounen (disregarding reverse Harems, I don't recall many Bishounen + harems...).

AA12376180	The name is not listed in the Pierce Piano Atlas, so I cannot tell you anything in particular about that brand however, I can tell you about this type of piano in general.    In the 1960's and early 70's a large number of upright pianos were brought over from Europe, mostly England. They all had beautiful cabinets and all were horribly out of tune.    They were not sold in piano stores but were sold in antique stores. Most sold for around $200. They all had open pin blocks, two pedals and the bird cage action. Most were made in the mid 1800's.    The new owners would call their tuners to tune the piano and the tuner would take one look and say "sorry, I am not touching that piano". Soon the buyers realized they had made a mistake and put the piano in the classifieds for $200, trying just to get their money back.    You did not mention exactly how long you have had this piano and did not say where it was made. Probably the most valuable things on the piano are the candle holders. I've seen these go at auctions for $200.    As far as the value of the piano? Does any of the above sound like your piano? If so, the value is $0 to $50.     Sorry to be the harbinger of bad news.|`|vsy4QMHMaa	Must be an English beast.    Birdcage actions are virtually unfixable any more. Any parts would have to be made one-off at a very high labor rate. The piano has very little value as an instrument, there might be some interest in it as an antique _IF_ you can find the candle holders or very similar equivalents and _IF_ the case is in tip-top shape.

NC67WVlEaa	I have their greatest hits type album. It's called The Best of Blur. I think it would be a good idea to start with that.|`|QWaspeg7aa	I was a massive Blur fan in the 90s. You have to start with Modern Life is Rubbish- this was the album that really started put Blur in the spotlight and I think it's the Blurriest of all of them. Go backwards then to Leisure because this was the one that got people (ie public audience) to notice them- There's No Other Way was a pretty big song for a while, and She's So High I remember being on one of those free tapes you used to get with music magazines. The Great Escape is probably their biggest, at least biggest known album because it was massive when it was out and was their Blur v Oasis album when Britpop was at its height- I actually wore mine out and had to buy it again. I loved The Great Escape at the time but it's not now my personal favourite, that would be Modern Life is Rubbish closely followed by Parklife- Parklife . After that Blur, then 13, then Think Tank. <br>  <br>  BTW If you want to get into Britpop, it wasn't just about Oasis and Blur. Pulp who had been around for a while got big at the time- His n' Hers is definitely worth a listen as is Different Class. Also Supergrass I Should Coco. There were loads of bands around at the time- it was like all of a sudden people were only interested in British bands so you could give Suede a go (Dog Man Star is awesome- if you're in America they had to call themselves the London Suede), Cast, Menswear, Mansun, Elastica, Kula Shakar, Reef, Manic Street Preachers are all great too.|`|695QqLK6aa	Parklife

AA10025824	Well, anyway, we got about 4 or 5 inches but the rain is taking it down.    People hit the "report abuse" button randomly it seems.

hk4v0G6faa	Yes- it's off to Rehab for Carly.  I am not a huge fan of that the story line for Carly.  She has enough problems- why add alcoholism?  I would almost prefer a "who's your daddy story line".  Although- I would like it more if they were not going to include the pregnancy into the storyline for her to fall into a coma or something.  I get tired of people making Carly out to be this horrible person.  She is my favorite character on the show and had hoped the show would write a better exit (even if a short one) for the pregnancy leave.  Something that would perhaps bring Carly and Jack back together or closer to a reunion- a car accident- a robbery at Metro and she is shot?  Something that is NOT Carly's fault.  Not- she drank too much and now she is off to rehab.  How many characters on this show are not allowed to have a drink??  It's too many.|`|irSBrZiQaa	First off I am so happy for Maura and Scott. At first I read that they were going to write the pregnancy into the show and have a who's the daddy storyline. However here recently I have read that Carly will become an alcoholic and leave the show to go to rehab. Apparently her dad also suffered from alcoholism. I am glad there is not going to be a who's the daddy storyline, but I am disappointed that she will go into rehab. Either way I wish Maura all the best.<br>  <br>  Edit: Kev B, I am sure she will be back too:)  I was just wishing her the best with her pregnancy.|`|vqUVWPBAaa	This is her fifth baby and the only time she left the show for more than just her maternity leave was the first child that she had with her first husband.  Each pregnancy after that Carly has either been kidnapped or ran away, or something like that to explain her extended absence even when the pregnancy was written in. From what I understand this pregnancy will not become apart of her story line. Heck, when Lesli Kay (Molly) was on maternity leave her character was in a coma.|`|PRDZmeiEaa	Yeah her real life husband is still Andy Dixon well that's the characters name from atwt... He is Kim Hugh's oldest son anyways I know that they were married and when parker was a little boy that was Carly's son in real life...|`|zFb022Iiaa	I don't know the actor's names, but there was a Carly Daddy storyline a few years ago.|`|8xdcBKfUaa	Anita is correct, but I'm sure that Carly will be back.|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	I am happy for her!  I hadn't heard she was pregnant.  It would make sense that she will have to go to alcohol rehab., probably as a result of the vodka line she and Craig have created together.  But I will really hate to see that happen.  I wanted her to be a success with this career and be able to move forward with her life.  This will have such a big affect on her children on the show.

Along the way he meets diffrent people who he made a huge impact on for the short time he new them. Many of the Letters he sent to them are in the book, He keept a diary too wich talked all aout his adventures, 2 years later, he goes on his Great Alaskin Adventure, where he spends over 100 days alone in the Alaskin wild where he stumbles across a abandoned bus and lives in it for over 100 days without seeing anybody.

As I was looking, there is always an article after any awards show that tells you how to get the looks of the stars for less. There was some references to Target, they were and are starting to bring more name brand designers in their store and not only does it costs less but they actually look good!

I listen to the beat... the second time Iisten to it.. I listen to their words. Some rappers do put messages in their songs... TI.. in his new album... Lil Wayne.. some of his songs.|`|OpBFc27iaa	mostly the lyrics, i mean a good beat makes the songs good, but the lyrics are what makes up a song...lyrics are the number one thing i look for..but if its not a lyrical artist, then flow and maybe the beat.|`|yB3Jek85aa	i listin to  the beats and the rhymes 100%|`|iEGSjQCKaa	Beatz = Get's u listening    Lyrics = Keeps u listening|`|AA10687320	the first thing that catches me is the beat. then i gotta go back and listen to the lyrics.|`|5PdcYdDpaa	Lyrics are more important IMO but good rappers have both.|`|VSzF36Ywaa	Bad lyrics can't kill a good beat.  But a bad beat can kill good lyrics.|`|EN0NBIq2aa	i think lyrics are JUST as important as beats maybe more important because if you dont have anything tooo sing about its kinda gay.  Even though some songs are cool but i agree with you.|`|71zSMj5Qaa	For me, I look for a connection, and I connect better through words. Lyrics are the most important thing to me. I enjoy an artist who can tell a story - I love Common, for that very reason. Music can serve so many different puposes in life - I use music to relate.|`|0ZAAi2q2aa	Lyrics are very important. Most of my favorite songs have good beats, but my favorite beats tend to come from songs which the lyrics are OK...    Anyway, it seems nowadays the trend is to have the best beat possible first, and worry about the lyrics later (beats are easier to hear than lyrics most of the time). Also, with all the remixing going on, it's easier to get away with having not-so-great lyrics because you can just do a remix with Kanye or Lil' Wayne or T-Pain or somebody and have them do the legwork for you.|`|DoO04zsqaa	I listen to the lyrics, then the beats|`|nFiv4hXzaa	yup|`|5PR33NkMaa	all about the lyrics and what they got to say the beats are just there to make the songs catchy, and i hate all the new hip hop nothing lyrical what so ever, last good rapper was eminem his lyrics were insane, now its all about bitches and hoes nothing else|`|DVREIVbpaa	I personally like music more that has lyrics that reach out to you. Lyrics where you can listen to it, and feel it. I will admit that without a good beat, the song won't be good, but the lyrics are the main goal. Like Tupac, ****, that's good lyrics. I like rappers who lyric about their life, and true things, instead of cars, hoes, money. (But I will admit, when it comes to bass, and dancing.. Cars, Hoes, and Money are catchy ;]...)

"Shinkai has been called "The New Miyazaki" in several reviews including Anime Advocates and ActiveAnime, though he disagrees with this comparison, stating that "it is an overestimation".  "FIve Centimeters Per Second" ;  http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclop...  "Genres: drama, romance, slice of life   Plot Summary: A tale of two people, Tono Takaki and Shinohara Akari, who were close friends but gradually grow farther and farther apart as time moves on. They become separated because of their families yet continue to exchange contact in the form of letters. Yet as time continues to trudge on, their contact with one another begins to cease. Years pass and the rift between them grows ever larger. However, Takaki remembers the times they have shared together, but as life continues to unfold for him, he wonders if he would be given the chance to meet Akari again as the tale embarks on Takaki's realization of the world and people around him.

"Genres: adventure, drama, romance, science fiction   Themes: Military   Age rating: Teenagers (May contain bloody violence, bad language, nudity)   Plot Summary: In an alternate timeline, Japan was divided after losing World War II: Hokkaido was annexed by "Union" while Honshu and other southern islands were under US sovereignty. A gigantic yet mysterious tower was constructed at Hokkaido and could be seen clearly from Aomori (the northernmost prefecture of Honshu) across Tsugaru Strait. In the summer of 1996, three 9th-graders had made a promise that one day they'll build an aircraft and unravel the tower's mystery, but their project was abandoned after the girl, Sayuri Sawatari, began experiencing sleeping sickness and transferred to Tokyo for better treatment. Three years later, Hiroki Fujisawa accidentally found out that Sayuri had been in coma since then, and he asked Takuya Shirakawa to help him finding a way to revive her. What they don't know yet is that Sayuri's unconsciousness is somehow linked with secrets of the tower and the world. "  "Voices of a Distant Star" ;  http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclop...

9Qf4khqLaa	Social workers definitely need to intervene and take away the octuplets and put them up for adoption. She doesn't have the means to support even herself let alone 14 kids. I'd say take away the 6 other children as well, but that would be more difficult because they are older.|`|AA12336927	I think she should keep them, but that the Doctor who implanted her should have to pay the child support. Why should tax payers have to do it?<br>   What bothers me, is that when a woman wants to have plastic surgery, she is counseled in a way and when a transvestite wants to have their sex changed they too have to be counseled. Why aren't crazy women who want to have "Litters" have to go through counseling??|`|YkseyT7zaa	She won't. The state will take them and the taxpayers will pay for them|`|AA10546011	I sincerely hope that the hospital has social workers trying to decide if the mom has the means to care for 14 children.<br>  <br>  If she doesn't they should be put in foster homes.|`|AA12382198	I think she should have a chance to see if you can properly take care of all the children before anybody steps in.<br>  <br>  It's about the children now.....not her.|`|yv3unx5Eaa	The kids should be taken and she should be jailed.|`|AA11892241	yes|`|Qy9nZgBhaa	I don't think she should get them.  She is not right in the head.  If you have actually watched any of her interviews you would see that something is not right with her.  She can't afford them, heck, she can't afford the 6 she already has.  She lives with her parents and their house is going to be up for foreclosure soon.  So NO she should not be able to keep them, and I think they should take a few of the other 6 and adopt them out to people who can't have children.|`|az9MSYvQaa	She should do the porno and take the million then she can hire someone to take care of her children for her and the taxpayers won't have to. The doctor that implanted her knowing she already had six children should lose his license and never be allowed to practice infertility again!|`|QwpRD7DUaa	I'm getting sick and tired of all this, when shes on tv, i change the channel & cant stand to see it. they need to leave her alone, its none of their business. & no i don't think they should take them. who cares if she has 14 kids, just let her live her life.|`|q65I7cpZaa	on a related note.... Ripley's Believe It or Not offered her $500,000 for her uterus.  I'd say anything that guarantees that she won't reproduce again, is a bargain!!|`|g09x06Zpaa	Octomom is on welfare. I say the taxpayers decide what to do with her kids.<br>  <br>  Did you see her on ET last night? she was freaking psyco..what a Bi***|`|p65mPSozaa	No.  The social workers need to do more research and not let her have them. <br>  <br>  Poor kids...

0vfX40Qxaa	Jazz music grew out of the music made by African Americans in the south especially New Orleans. It started around the turn of the century and grew out of Ragtime, Blues, and the popular Marching Band music of the time. It is a blend of Western and African music, and shares elements of both, It was essentially a marching band that used the African influence of syncopated rhythms, call and response, pentatonic scales, and improvisation. It was primarily considered low class when it started, but gained popularity in the 1920's becoming the most popular genre of music by the 30's and 40's<br>  2 minutes|`|IeLBIACaaa	Jazz is a primarily American musical art form which originated at the beginning of the 20th century in African American communities in the Southern United States from a confluence of African and European music traditions.

An example of this would be after hurricane Katrina many jazz and blues artists were left without their instruments- in effort to restore the community of the music that so defines them, huge benefits and fundraiser were held.

AA11019219	Yes, I'd have to agree. Sometimes it is hard to tell the difference between Joey and Jordan. It wasn't that hard 20 years ago because they didn't sound that much the same.     I didn't even know Jordan sang in the song "Single" until I saw them perform it live on The View. When I saw Jordan sing I was like, "I didn"t know Jordan sang in this song!!" I was shocked because up until then I had always though that it was only Joey and Donnie.     Jordan has a higher pitched voice than Joey and Joey's voice is deeper than Jordan's.     A good way to see who sings which part of what song is to go to YouTube and look up some of the live performances from their tour. They didn't sing all the songs from "The Block" on that tour, but at least you'll get an idea and it will help you figure out the rest of the songs.     If you go to my Yahoo Answers profile you can get the link for my YouTube channel and take a look through the NKOTB videos that I have saved to my playlists there. Be sure to look for the ones called "NKOTB- 2008 Tour" and "NKOTB- 2009 European Tour".    I hope this helps. ?      Source(s):  Proud New Kids And Joey McIntyre Fan Since 1988  ?

3N2ElzcQaa	I like both. I'm not on any side anymore. It just depends on how the voices are expressed in either language (there's mulitple).    I used to be just on the subbers' side, but I grew to like the dubb more. I grew up with watching anime in dubb anyway. Both sides are good.    but, the war, its getting ridiculous.|`|Hiasgb75aa	Generally subs would be better because they are the original voices, and phrases aren't shortened to fit mouth movements, but sometimes dubs are better than subs, Cowboy Bebop and FLCL are good examples|`|HcZppReOaa	Subs because I like the voice better.    Dubs because there are those times where I can't be bothered looking at subs and the voices are't that bad (Bleach is horrible)    So I like both but overall subs.|`|8a65aa558e9ad4329fd6cecf8635eb04aa	Subs are original. The voices are from where the anime is first create. Because it's the original, it's better. Dubs can be good or bad, depending on how the voice actors capture the original's expressions and emotions in the voice. Sometimes in the English version, I think the female voices are bit too high and it sounds more annoying than cute compare to the original Japanese female voice. Of course for males, some Dubs voice sound way more male like than the original Japanese. Example is Fruit Basket. Yuki was voiced by a female,  maybe to express his feminine looks and side....however I thought the MALE tone in the dub is better|`|MZFIJf1zaa	Subs|`|jiSMcjQ8aa	Subs, because it sounds better 80% of the time.

na9OvpEwaa	im sorry i don't know too much about singing lessons, but i think you should try them. they might help you get over your stage fright. I get stage fright as well, but a bit differently. i cant sing in front of people i know. the way i look at crowds, though, is that no one will criticize you if your bad, or embarrass you if your good. they dont know you so what can they do to you? plus, if you love singing, then get so good that when you sing in front of people, you'll have nothing to worry about! just getting out there and doing something you love will be good enough for those people anyway! besides, when you play rockband, has anyone ever said you that you sing bad? probaly not!|`|djuRlggeaa	I dont know about lessons. But for stage fright, maybe have a friend or two near you. It really helps me.|`|giFsfAg5aa	welll. if you wanna get good get singing lessons.  this is gonna improve your confidence and   you'll feeel better singing infront of people.|`|CcYpcSb1aa	the only way to get over the fear is to face it.  some singers are always afraid before shows, but they use that o power them through.  singing lessons wont help you with stage fright, only your own will power can.|`|IUJoOymZaa	if you take singing lessons you can get better! thats if you want though. mabey try singing to a little group and then sing infront of more people, dont worry about what they think. hope i helped  good luck|`|GWAkMFflaa	Well, voice lessons are always a good thing to take, especially if someone is willing to learn. :) You might want to drop by your school's choir room and ask about the voice teacher who works at that school. If your school doesn't have a voice teacher, then look in the yellow pages. Call around and find a price that suits you.     Also, voice teachers understand things like being frightened of singing in front of people. They will usually work with you and help you overcome those fears. If you don't feel comfortable with a teacher after a few lessons than find someone else.     And really, the only way to get over stage fright is by actually singing in front of people. I was exactly the same way, and it's better now only because I've done it a few times. Good luck!!! :D

srtoPxN2aa	I guess both bands were known for releasing both very strong, and very weak albums IMO. So with that said, I'd say I like them equally.    Favorite Judas Priest Albums, in no particular order:  Sad Wings of Destiny  Killing Machine  Stained Class  Screaming for Vengeance  Rocka Rolla  Sin After Sin  Point of Entry    A few of my many favorite Judas Priest songs:  Genocide  The Hellion  Desert Plains  Let Us Prey  Running Wild  Hot Rockin'  The Ripper  Don't Go  Bloodstone  Solar Angels  Delivering the Goods  Rocka Rolla  Turning Circles  Run of the Mill  Dreamer Deceiver  Electric Eye  Cheater  Dissident Aggressor  Killing Machine  Call for the Priest / Raw Deal  Heading Out To The Highway  Beyond the Realms of Death  Exciter    Favorite Iron Maiden albums, in no particular order :  Killers  Powerslave  Iron Maiden (1st album)  The Number of the Beast   Moonchild  Piece of Mind  Seventh Son of a Seventh Son    A few of my favorite Iron Maiden songs:  Phantom of the Opera  Sun and Steel  22 Acacia Avenue  Prowler  The Evil That Men Do  Murders in the Rue Morgue  The Duellists  Women In Uniform (Skyhooks cover tune)  The Prisoner  Flight of Icarus  The Prophecy  Charlotte the Harlot  The Trooper  Rime of the Ancient Mariner  Genghis Khan  Die With Your Boots On  All In Your Mind (Stray cover tune)  The Number of the Beast  Losfer Words (Big Orra)  Wrathchild  Hallowed Be Thy Name  Prodigal Son    I'd like to give my personal opinion regarding two of the bands most popular albums, 'Number of The Beast', and 'British Steel'...    Though it was a groundbreaking album, for me 'British Steel' was one of the most boring albums ever released by Judas Priest. Also it seemed very rudimentary in a musical sense compared to previous albums like Killing Machine, Stained Class, Sin After Sin, and Sad Wings of Destiny. I actually preferred their follow-up 'Point of Entry', which many Priest fans can't stand. I'm aware that KK and Glen aren't virtuosos by any means...but British Steel seemed very lame musically. In an artists sense it's comparable to 'paint by numbers'...or rather 'music by numbers' I guess. I felt they were just going through the motions at that point.  I realize that it was a turning point for the band in terms of commercial success, and sometimes when that happens, many other things are lost, or left out of the artistic process. That album as a whole was lacking in so many ways compared to the aforementioned albums.  1980 was the peak of the NWoBHM invasion, and many youngsters were just discovering Judas Priest, a band that had been around for several years at that point. Perhaps they were easily impressed by the simplistic hooks 'British Steel' had to offer?I know I wasn't, and neither were many others who were followers of the band for years prior to the release of that album. To many of us who were in our mid 20's at that time, it was a step back for the band in an artistic sense...though a huge step forward in terms of commercialism.        I felt that 'Number of the Beast' had much more to offer in terms of musicianship, and writing ability.  I'm sure that back in the early 80's I would have ranked both albums as follows:  British Steel - 4 out of 10.  Number of the Beast - 8 out of 10.    Today it might look more like this:  British Steel - 3 out of 10.  Number of the Beast - 7 out of 10.  Lol.  'British Steel' had some cool riffs...but an album can't stand on riffs alone, at least not for me. Where were the great guitar solos that KK and Glen had become known for prior to this?  The soloing, riffage, creativity, and musicianship were far better on 'Number of the Beast' IMO.    We must not forget that Iron Maiden was hugely influenced by the likes of many 70's hard rock and metal bands...with early Judas Priest, Sabbath, Rainbow, Stray, and Budgie being right up there. But somehow I doubt that 'British Steel' gave the boys in Iron Maiden much in the way of musical inspiration. Also, these albums were released two years apart from one another. 'British Steel' first saw release in April 1980, while 'Number of the Beast' was released in March 1982. Two years might not sound like much in comparison by today's standards in terms of musical progression. But back at that time a lot of things occurred in the world of metal during those two years.  It would be interesting to compare Iron Maidens first album, which came out around the same time as 'British Steel'.  Though I would still choose Iron Maiden's debut!    All that aside, as I said...it's a draw when comparing the two bands in general.    BQ: So far so good!|`|SazPJ3iKaa	I prefer Judas Priest    Iron Maiden has lots of good songs, I love their riffs. But their lyrics... I can't get into the beast stuff    Judas Priest has so many good songs    70's  Dissident Aggressor  The Ripper   Tyrant    80's  Electric Eye  Painkiller  Breaking The Law  Grinder  Some Heads Are gonna Roll  I could go on and on... I own every priest album except rock and rolla and the other singer.    Iron Maiden    Phantom Of The Opera  Ides Of March  Genghis Khan  Hallowed By Thy Name  Purgatory  Aces High  Powerslave  Transylvania  The Trooper    I really like maiden, but im not a huge fan of Bruce, and his lyrics arent really my cup of tea..  Rob has some horrible lyrics *Eat Me Alive*|`|FDt7cC8haa	Priest...    Some Heads Are Gonna Roll  Eat You Alive  Screaming For Vengeance      I prefer Priest over Maiden because I hate 9 minute songs, which maiden just simply love to do....    oh my god...If Maiden had more influence over Metallica.....  then Definitely Priest....  Listening to the last 4 Metallica albums.....yeah,....it's crap at it finest....|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	Judas Priest.    I like them both and have seen both in concert, but Priest has more songs that I seem to relate to personally.    Eat Me Alive  Breaking The Law  Screaming For Vengeance    BQ:  Not too bad, thanks!|`|cUjcn2lsaa	Iron Maiden|`|6EoAKcMwaa	This is very hard to answer. I like Bruce Dickinson's voice better than I like Rob Halford's. BUT...there are more Judas Priest songs that I like. For me, I think it may be a tie. DON'T MAKE ME CHOOSE!!!!!!!!    Judas Priest songs  Breaking the Law  Living After Midnight  Painkiller  Electric Eye  Hell Bent for Leather    Iron Maiden Songs  Run to the Hills  Die with Your Boots On  Flight of Icarus  Aces High    My Wednesday is ok, no school today so I am home and bored to death|`|ibDadEHDaa	Iron Maiden  Priest's not bad but from what i've heard a lot of their songs sounded similar to me and most of their albums were alright and had like 2 or 3 good songs.    Maiden's my favorite band and I like to think the majority of their albums have at least 4 or 5 great songs.    Here are some of my favorite Maiden songs:  Charlotte the Harlot  Phantom of the Opera  22 Acacia Avenue  Hallowed Be Thy Name  2 Minutes to Midnight  Deja Vu  The Nomad  Paschendale  Alexander the Great  The Trooper  Die with your boots on    and I can go on and on|`|gDxMoBl9aa	From My Top 100 Bands of all time on RateYourMusic.....     21 Judas Priest    1.

(i do really like priest though, especially Painkiller, Oh my god is that awesome)    but for maiden, its all about The Number of the Beast and Ace's High... and the Trooper, oh and 2 Minutes to midnight... so amazing, and even though Bruce is an Ozzy hating duechebag the band and the music is great.|`|d0b19b6e53bf5f04f7ade24285468c28aa	judas priest|`|pNUtnoC8aa	Judas Priest but, Metallica owns both of them.|`|7914f974f3cd0a96cc6883956102da35aa	Iron Maiden.

Some of Judas Priest's stuff is just too mainstream/poppy for me (British Steel album), yet Maiden has stayed solid and epic.  Some of my favorites from Priest are Painkiller and Electric Eye, and my favs from Maiden are Run to the Hills, Number of the Beast, The Trooper, Prowler, Longest Day, and Hallowed by Thy Name.    BQ: Yeah, snow day!|`|1jPZZE9zaa	To me. The answer is Iron Maiden.    A lot of people will say Priest because they say without Priest there would be no Maiden. I just prefer Iron Maiden's earlier work much more than I do Judas Priest's.    Fav Songs:    Where Eagles Dare  Murders in the Rue Morgue  Aces High  Phantom of the Opera  Gangland    I personally LOVE every song Iron Maiden did from Start through Powerslave!    BA: I had a good day, At home relaxing with 2 sick little ones  4 and 8. We live in Tampa Fl. and things are getting nutty down here for the Superbowl.

Maiden though is just classic, they are just sooo amazing. But the 9 minute songs do get old. Here are some of my fav's from Maiden    Children of the Damned  Wicker Man  Heaven Can Wait  Murders in the Rue Morgue  Run to the Hills  Moonchild  Wrathchild  The Trooper  Number of the Beast  Where Eagles Dare... And wayyyyy more|`|5uvTte8Zaa	If the last band I heard was Priest, I prefer Maiden.  If I heard Maiden last, I prefer Priest. I like them both equal, though I feel like Priest has had a far better career.    Maiden=Drifter, Purgatory, Prodigal Son, Twighlight Zone, Gangland, Flash of the Blade, Still Life.  Priest=Troubleshooter, The Green Manilishi(With The Two-Pronged Crown), Stained Class, The Ripper, Some Heads Are Gonna Roll, Desert Plains, The Centinell.|`|08Ksc5Oiaa	Iron Maiden.    Iron Maiden, Hallowed Be Thy Name, The Wicker Man, Genghis Khan.

I just hope Dan Dierdorf is there somehow and gets to say INNER SSEPP SHUNN  about 50 times.|`|RRTaCxDlaa	Why turn the sound off on the commercials? The commercials are the best part.|`|38fe66cc26fd24d41aff94bf6ba97574aa	If that is what they want to do good for them.  The only reason I watch the Super Bowl is for the commercials.  It is the only time of the year I can see commercials with out being annoyed.|`|IosSWwFxaa	I'd make sure I was first in line to go.  It's not like because people go to church they don't enjoy sports.  And it's a nice way to enjoy each other's company, get to know one another better outside of church.  It's like those team building exercises they make us do at work, but in this case it's more likely to be with people you actually WANT to hang out with.   As for the commercials and half time show, I sort of understand that, they can be scandalous, but the ones that are tasteful are half the fun of SuperBowl Sunday.|`|3258fd9ca0baa8e13a1a5449e7bdca00aa	I would think that they need to lighten up a little bit and that they very badly need to get over their collective complex about Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction.

I would just go to a sports bar|`|eZbkg3BWaa	Pffffft!!  I'd watch the SuperBowl at home instead, with some friends, and with lots of yummy food! =)    What would I be doing in a church in the first place..?  I'm slightly allergic to them.. XD|`|BhQSTvLsaa	Yeah, I don't go to church.    They have some weird ideas.    I mean, I believe in god to an extent and I do consider myself Christian but really, some of this sh*t in the bible sounds delusional and some people just take it WAY too far!      I hope this doesn't offend anyone. It's just my opinion.|`|58KUMpF0aa	That would be fine... as long as the party didn't interfere with regular church service.
soUND2xEaa	ROFL XD YOU MADE MY DAY LOL gimme some yo mama jokes "please and thank you" XD    Yo mama so fat people jog around her for exercise  Yo mama so fat she lay on the beach and people run around yelling Free Willy  Yo mama so fat she had to go to Sea World to get baptized  Yo mama so stupid it took her 2 hours to watch 60 minutes  Yo mama so stupid she sold her car for gasoline money!

Yo mama so poor when I ring the doorbell she says,"DING!"    Yo mama so stupid when she saw the NC-17 (under 17 not admitted) sign, she went home and got 16 friends    Yo mama so stupid when your dad said it was chilly outside, she ran outside with a spoon    also another good topic would be good chuck norris jokes    Chuck Norris' tears cure cancer. Too bad he has never cried.      Chuck Norris counted to infinity - twice.     Oswald shot, Chuck Norris met all three bullets with his beard, deflecting them. JFK's head exploded out of sheer amazement.     Chuck Norris has already been to Mars; that's why there are no signs of life there     Chuck norris once ate a bottle of sleeping pills. They made him blink.    Behind his beard, there is not a chin, but a second fist.    Chuck Norris put humpty dumpty back together again, only to roundhouse kick him in the face. Later Chuck dined on scrambled eggs with all the king's horses and all the king's men. The king himself could not attend for unspecified reasons. Coincidentally, the autopsoy revealed the cause of death to be a roundhouse kick to the face. There is only one King.|`|V06bwNUBaa	yo mama is so fat she jumoed in an ocean and whales started saying "we are family, even though your fatter than me"|`|Gip80FFVaa	yo mama is so fat  she comes from both sides of the family!|`|0ic8aqwcaa	yo mamma is so stupid she got locked in a supermarket and starved  yo mamma is so fat when she jumped for joy she got stuck  yo mamma is so fat when she sat on the rainbow, skittles popped out  yo mamma is so stupid she sat on the tv and watched the couch|`|UC1QCWuLaa	yo mama so fat she see a school bus go by and says "catch that twinky"|`|BswVoF8Paa	Yo mama is so ugly she walked into a haunted house and came out with an application.

B52KNW7Haa	Well there are 305 million people in the US and 6 billion worldwide.      Since all of them are unique and the stars or the date in which they were born have nothing to do with how they live their life nor how random circumstances that happen to each of them every second of the day will affect them and their character.... You would have to be more specific in who you want to know more about.

There the type that will want you, love you, be with you, but will not call you for 2 months. (More the immature ones) They are very loyal for the most part but they have penetrating eyes that will read through your mind. Scorpio men are kinda hard to handle, but woman of this sign are horrible to handle. But if you have one, they are loyal. ugh i hate scorpios.|`|EpWt1IQGaa	They are the most overrated sign in the zodiac (coming from a scorpio rising). People expect alot from them because of their reputation but really they are normal people like the rest of the signs.|`|872fcc76954a83920779a9df510b118baa	as parents they are extremely dedicated and far seeing.  the men are kind of have a Darth Vader complex and the females can remind you of Roseanne.  They have extreme characters and they think they are great as they are.  They usually are great although they need to cool off from their kids and not often be so crowding!!  Let their children grow and experience their talents and support their growth all the way, by letting them pursue their dreams.  trust others in the family and don't let secrets spread!    Scorpios are magnetic and intense and the kind of people you feel good to just casually know.  they seem to have no fear of strangers.  They don't care how they appear on the outside althrough they almost laways choose a fitting and attractive style of dressing.  They may trust in you more than they do their own selves.  They will be greatly loyal and compassionate through and through.  They are good at steering people in the way they want you to do something for their companionship.  Though the Scorpio should aspire to not try to control people in their own way, as it would just not be a benefit to their own life and their futures.  They often like to play the role of a mediator  :)

IFf5r9zAaa	My personal favourite is Low End Theory, mostly because it has Verses From the Abstract on it and that's my favourite ATCQ song.

gQEtEtLQaa	I mostly use www.sidereel.com to watch Supernatural online.  If you click on this link it will take you straight to the Supernatural page:  http://www.sidereel.com/Supernatural    It's free to use and almost every episode of Supernatural is available including all aired episodes of seasons 3 and 4.    Basically, all you have to do is select the episode you want to watch and then there's usually quite a few links to other sites which host that episode.  I generally find that megastic is one of the best sites for watching episodes because it seems to load faster.  There might be a lot of links for megavideo but the episodes only stay up for a couple of days before they're removed so a lot of the megavideo links are probably dead ones.    When you click on the link for the episode - for example one of the ninjavideo links (they're usually quite good too)  http://www.sidereel.com/Supernatural/_wa...  you'll get a second window opening - if you see an ad for party poker - don't worry, just ignore it, they pop up all the time - just click out of it and you should get a little screen (which you can enlarge to full size) with a big "play" sign in the centre.    You might find that it takes a while to load and keeps stopping and starting - usually if you just let it run then come back to it and rewind it back to the beginning it should play perfectly.    Sorry if this explanation seems really long and goes on and on - hope I helped though : )|`|B9HL3Ax9aa	Here you can watch all seasons of supernatural. No ads :):  http://supernatural.ishareseries.com

PW1vXqruaa	Hail! You have the heart of a warrior!  If I had a nickel for every time I wanted to samck the crap out of someone who had no idea what I was talking about,I'd never have to lift a finger a day in my life ever again! It gets worse. Those people who say they don't "care much"for B&W films!EEEKKKK. Yes, I not only ridicule them(publicly so there's no room for conjecture)I immediatly consign their souls to the fiery Halls of Hades without hope of remdemption! Philistines! NOT having seen Gone With The Wind? Outrageous! Some fool walked up to me and asked me,to my horror,who Bette Davis is. No one has seen him since and that's all I can say on the subject!LOL|`|80ehnLBJaa	Definitely.  I'm a huge fan of the classics--silents, pre-codes (1929-1934,) film noir, Hitchcock, etc.  I have a great appreciation for many eras and genres of film.  But, my personal expertise is in the 1930's.  Just adore Bette Davis, Barbara Stanwyck, William Powell and Myrna Loy, Norma Shearer, Olivia de Havilland, Kay Francis, Joan Crawford, Jean Harlow, Clark Gable, Carole Lombard, etc.    How could someone not know who Bette Davis is?  I was imitating her when I was only 4 or 5 years old!  I grew up on the black and white films. So, far I've seen 80 Bette Davis films. I got an early start like you have.  When I was younger, no one knew who I was speaking of, either.  Very annoying.  I feel like educating the world.  It's terrible that these great talents and films are becoming forgotten gems of the past.|`|yqe0I5zpaa	Yes, when people say they don't know who Brian De Palma, Martin Scorsese or Francis Ford Coppola are, i get deeply annoyed. When people say that Twilight, Paul Blart, Notebook, A Walk To Remember are the best movies ever, i think to myself they don't know what the hell a brilliant film is, or even a good movie at that. Pattinson doesn't compare to Ledger, like people (tween girls) are doing. I like films like No Country For Old Men, The Departed, Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, American Beauty, brilliant films by great directors and amazing actors. When somebody doesn't know my favorite actors and actresses like Robert De Niro, Naomi Watts, Leonardo DiCaprio, Marlon Brando, Paul Newman and Clint Eastwood, i don't want to slap them but i simply want to punch them in the face.      Hey Christine, i'm "Scar Jokes" and I am a BIG TIME film snob.        I have FEB. 22 on my calander, i love seeing brilliant films getting recognized, i wonder why Twilight wasn't nominated.....|`|s34GP3Ioaa	OMG!!!!  I answered yes to all of your questions.  You opened up my eyes.........................I am a film snob.  Major...major...major.  I love film.  Yesteryear, present and looking forward to more films in the future.  I hated Mamma Mia movie.  One of the tackiest musicals ever made.|`|nci2WOYXaa	Hey Christine. You don't like Twilight? You must have intelligence of someone over the age of 15. Hi, i'm Craig and i'm a film snob too.|`|na8ObA5Haa	well i disagree with this one    "Do you hiss when people say 'The Notebook' and 'Twilight' are the best movies ever?"    The notbook is the best movie i have ever seen, Twilight however was not.     But i dont consider myself a movie snob, just a movie addict @ heart|`|W1lh6A8saa	I would have to agree with you on almost every one except for hissing at twilight, I actually thought the movie was pretty ok. And in fact, I have smacked my best friend once because she asked " Who the hell is Elizabeth Taylor?"|`|YUaMtlnxaa	I'm only 17 and I'm already a film snob.  When Paul Newman died and his picture was on People, there were so many kids in my school asking who he was. I must of listed off 10 movies before I finally had to mention Newman's Own salad dressing, and that only helped a few. I almost went nuts.
9QJqiF7Naa	Yes, she is still pretty.... But how can she NOT expect to get fat from going to Chilli's all the time with her beau?! You are what you eat. At least she doesn't have any eating disorder. But still, it's okay to eat fattening foods, just not on a regular basis.|`|IjzxagDiaa	Because she believes that to be a female celebrity you have to be:   A: Blonde   B: Good-looking   C: Skinny     She's just insecure. You probably would be too if you were her. Go easy on her. :)|`|mZUXkeyRaa	Maybe bc she is NOT fat!  She just gained a little weight  People made a big deal about nothing|`|mZcdC90Uaa	Because she probably thinks because she is a celeb. that it automatically makes her a thin lady. Sorry Jessica it doesn't work that way. Personally I wouldn't care if I was fan...actually I am kind of fluffy lol. I love junk food and I try to work out and take care of my self as best as I can but I am also going to enjoy myself. I think this whole thing is to get attention.   Stefani|`|jd14u32qaa	She shouldn't be.  She is just as famous for her looks as for her 'talent'.  That comes with the likelyhood that people are going to criticize her if she gains a noticeable amount of weight.|`|r4NdDWwKaa	according to her she has to be perfect|`|47e7f174343942df4985e92180812d30aa	I think she looks better than she did when she was so skinny... she still looks ok...|`|wQJtKx6zaa	She is no where near fat, but she is much healthier than the stick she use to be. She's happy and in love, and love can add pounds. I think the outfit was unflattering, but she is not fat by any means.
rlBc3AEBaa	It looks as though he his buying it for Sun because they keep flashing back and forth between him buying the panda and her giving birth.  However, Jin's is a flash back and Sun's is a flash forward.  Jin is actually buying the panda for some business associate's wife.|`|8WqTvPBbaa	that is correct nicki|`|DUg1IkTIaa	Yes, we saw Jin buying a Panda TWICE.  He lost the first one he purchased.    When the freighter exploded, Jin was still onboard.  It's assumed that he died.  Jin and Hurley visited a grave site where Jin is assumed to be buried.    So, in a nutshell, we really don't know if Jin is alive or dead.|`|OuTlT8f6aa	Jin is supposed to be dead as we saw the freighter get blown up and in that episode Jin is in a flashback not a flash forward.  Sun and Hurley go to visit his grave in that episode and in series 5 Sun has admitted she does'nt blame Kate for her husbands death.  However this is Lost so until we see Jin's body don't assume he really is dead ;)|`|2gstVBcMaa	yup...exactly what virgo said!!!

EioOPbzbaa	Chloe told Nicole where Sami was and that she was pregnant with EJ's baby so Nicole went to confront Sami.  When she arrived she overheard Sami tell Sister Teresa that she couldn't deliver in Salem and needed to find somewhere else.  Nicole went into her office and dropped the card for Dr. Baker's clinic and made up a phony story to throw her off.  Sami and Mia went into labor at same time with Nicole Delivering her baby.  Sami had problems and needed a C-section but unable to do at the clinic but finally delivered the little girl but wasn't crying when it went off.  Nicole left with Mia's baby for the clinic to attempt to switch with Sami's.|`|45df770cc1ffaa5b703b1506af4ca9c0aa	Switch it with Mia's baby and raise it as her own...you know how that always works out!|`|lSeH9NgHaa	she'll switch the baby's and then something will come up where EJ will want a mateernity test and low and behold it will comeback as his.  But the only thing that confuses me is it seemed like Nicole bonded with Mia's baby. It will be hard to see how she will let it go.

YpxGfmdKaa	Ya something in an old folks home would be hilarious I think!  You could have different types of characters like a skinny hippy whos always in the smoking room smokin weed and a small fat guy whos always chattin up the nurses theres loads of funny things that could happen but I  wont ramble on =P    P.s. ur hot ;) lol|`|ZtOnMoWcaa	i would think up a documentarie series which would include the most wrong things to happen|`|bxwGfPk8aa	^.^ i agree with about the hot thing he he    yeah, that would be really funny :D what would be really funny to watch though - which actually, me and my friend was discussing last night ha ha - would be if a boy we both hate who thinks he's hard stepped over a banana - because he is kind of clumsy - and straight into a hole...  but that's just are cruel fantasies of his death, but it would be quite funny to see on tv though :)

The placement of my cymbal hits and in thinking about where the backbeat can lay. He plays behind the backbeat when playing live which is really quite difficult to do. No he is not the best drummer ever but he certainly is innovative. His double bass drumming is grossly underrated.|`|M7E1uIsKaa	One  Seek and Destroy  The Four Horsemen  Master of Puppets  Whiskey in the Jar  Sad But True  Dont Tread on Me  For Whom the Bell Tolls|`|sz1YqwUEaa	Honestly mine is The Unforgiven.

Those are the ones which I could not leave out! Big list I know but that shows Metallicas class!     I'm not in a band but have started learning Metallica songs on the guitar, something no other band has inspired me to do.    Ok then, some others which are worth a mention are...    Battery  Disposable Heros  Leper Messiah  Damage inc  Blackened  ...And Justice for All  Eye of the Beholder  One  Enter Sandman  Sad But True  Holier Than Thou  The Unforgiven  Don't Tread on Me  Nothing else Matters  Of Wolf and Man  Fuel  Whisky in The Jar    I'm sure there would be more but I am yet to buy Kill 'em All & Ride the Lightning.|`|U2t6Pndhaa	1.

AA12135515	It was Paul on drums.           I have this great book called "The Beatles Recording Sessions" by Mark Lewisohn. According to the notes, Ringo was off filming "The Magic Christian" w/ Peter Sellers & George was "out of the country".|`|48df0ea585c1658be36a46553408d993aa	I didn't know any of that (no surprise there I'm sure ;-)  Somehow it just seems to fit... The two of them were the creative force behind the Beatles songwriting, and to envision just the two of them working this song out... well, I rather like it. And that's nothing against George and Ringo ~ it's just sorta sweet that it was just John and Paul.    Also, the content of the song does seem to be opening another chapter in their lives and careers. John is going off more with Yoko and doing what they were going to do ~ which was not be part of the Beatles any longer.    Nice Q, Mr. B

The action scenes are awesomeeee, but there's only, like, three, and there's just mindless chatter during the rest of it. I'm serious-- they talk about very random things that have basically nothing to do with the movie.    Also, "Rubber Face", which was one of Jim Carrey's first movies.

Anywhoo he's sweet and careful.|`|eeUG0VYTaa	people are not in love with the ACTOR (not actress :)) they are in love with the character...bcuz he cares about bella and would rather die than be without her...and people want that to be real|`|KjzR1k1Kaa	BECAUSE he's sexy, bleeds glitter and cries topaz, hot, cute, has an adorable crooked smile, adn a million other reasons.|`|LRLu1ofNaa	I don't know why people like him. He's just some fictional character.|`|mZcdC90Uaa	Because they think this stalker is cute when he sparkles. I am sorry there is a fine line between protecting your girl and stalking her. It is one thing to tell her to remember to lock her doors and drive safe but when you go and watch her sleep or rip out her car parts that is ridiculous. The guy only likes Bella because apparently she smells good. Or that is all I hear about in the book. It is just a lust novel. The only good part about it was you didn't have to think to read it. I have so many other reasons but this is on Edward so..He sucks at trusting and is supposedly the perfect guy with the perfect self control. If he had perfect self control why did he keep f*cking her after he saw that she had bruises. What a sleezy f*ck? Even if she said it was okay my guy wouldn't even go on.  Stefani|`|bmwR7RdMaa	coz he's a vampire ! :(|`|Dq1r2ixlaa	I really don't know. He's not even real! He watched Bella sleep when they weren't even dating; stalker much?|`|GEyJMsaKaa	Are you talking about rob pattinson or the actual character ??|`|OZbZPNTtaa	because he is really romantic but he doesnt over do it.  and he just knows what to say at the right time|`|q8MVZtmEaa	I don't know. He's not real. Too perfect. And beautiful  It's every 7 year old girl's dream.  I for one like the REAL Taylor Lautner...he's hottttt?|`|MXp3Lh0taa	where are you going to find a person that perfect. He is a gentleman through and through. All of them are the same in the movie. They are very attentive towards their partners and show that they love them openly. May have something to do with the era that they were made vampires. I know it is only a movie but stephanie has written it so well. I love edward to death. He is my ideal man. The perfect guy who just does not exist in to days society. He is protective and would do anything to protect bella and those he loves around him. I could go on about him all day.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Because they are delusional teen fan-girls who can't discern fantasy from reality.|`|76dfb34e84a5375f6ceb56a8f30f239faa	Edward Cullen is not a real person you know....    but it shocks me how people are like   I mean, even before the film came out, where he is played by a realy person.    Sheesh|`|y92o0hkHaa	because hes a fantasy love trip|`|RD9H7ZdIaa	because he is beautiful!!! i love edward!|`|jvFhoov7aa	i dont know   its annoying!|`|33NNZ5Uvaa	No idea. Sounds like a stalker/abuser and a fake vampire to me...

If he can't have them go back the "God help us all."|`|phWUBtviaa	watch last weeks show tonight at 8.  its a repeat.  then at 9 will be tonight's show.|`|upotHqWcaa	watch last weeks episode before the new one on abc.    someone knows about kate not being related to aaron and that person went to some lawyers forcing them to take a blood test so they run away. thats some of it...|`|gJlxZdL5aa	Kate and Aaron are the run.....someone showed up at Kates insisting they had a court order for a blood sample from both to prove whether or not Aaron is her son.    (And we know he is Claires.....I personally think Claire is dead though)    She see Sun who says she doesn't blame Kate for Jins death (but I think she does because in a past episode she told her father that two people are responsible for Jins death and he was one of them)    Sayid is hurt.       And sayid told hurley whatever ben says do the opposite so hurley told the cops he killed a bunch of people and went to jail    thats pretty much it.

O Drcula e Frankenstein s?o dois clssicos onde romance-drama-terror nos fazem torcer pelo monstro.

a99d389b5e2d141735729942aac098fcaa	Ol Natlia...td bem?    Antigamente era assim, a moda era ser bem branquinho, pq ter pele bem branca era sin?nimo de nobreza, trabalhadores pegavam sol, pobre ent?o tinha a pele bronzeada. Os nobres n?o, principalmente as mulheres qdo se expunham ao sol eram sempre com elegantes chapus e sombrinhas, td mt chique.   A acabaram os escravos e os nobres tiveram q ir fazer alguma coisa, veio ent?o a era dos burgueses. Hoje quem tem dinheiro fica nas praias, nas piscinas, tomando gua de c?co e o papel inverteu, agora ser bronzeado  sin?nimo de status e de beleza para acompanhar as milionrias celebridades. E os pobres( trabalhadores), principalmente as mulheres se sucumbem ao bronzeado sabe como? Trancando todos os port?es da casa e esturricando no sol  nos fins de semana ( nico horrio q tm tempo), enquanto quem tem dinheiro  bronzeado pq s fica na praia. Temos q deixar de ser bobos e parar com isso, a pele q devemos preferir  a que temos. O branco, o ***** e o moreno todos temos nossa blz, e o sol n?o est brincadeira pra ficar torrando nele n?o . A mdia quer  vender seus produtos e os hospitais est?o lotados de inconsequentes q queriam ficar dourados pelo sol.   Eu tenho a pele mt alva e passo o mximo de filtro solar p/ n?o queimar nem um pouco, pq alm do cancer, quem tem pele o sol mancha a pele e envelhece.Gra?as a Deus tenho a pele limpinha sem nenhuma mancha.     Garanto q sua pele  bonita pq todas s?o, se vc bronzear pq esta numa piscina ou de frias na praia, passe bastante protetor, mas n?o fique em casa se expondo no sol n?o p/ bronzear q acaba com a pele e n?o tem sentido nenhum. O q se deve fazer hj em dia  se proteger, toda pele tem sua beleza natural e o sol devemos lembrar  um vil?o da pele.Fique com Deus e espero ter ajudado...e desculpe pela longa resposta...rs...mas ela vai ajudar vc refletir...|`|6e0fa2239a2e0f430c58f8cb09c6038faa	Prefiro idias!|`|ab850584eb4aa7334aa1c1b90197fb9daa	para mim tanto faz|`|d3b3d708f8db16a3f6e0af56dd16be56aa	Eu prefiro pele bem clarinha e coradinha, sou vidrado em mulher clarinha... como a luz do sol  rsrsr|`|f2be377f1b77b8d13ac6721df6eca226aa	Cada pele tem sua prpria beleza o importante  cuidar dela direitinho hoje em dia o Cancer de pele n?o respeita cor.

wJf1M8vAaa	El premio de los Oscares no se ha distinguido por premiar a las mejores pelculas desde el sentido extrictamente cinematogrfico, obviamente est lleno de interses polticos ?y cmo podra no estarlo? En ciertos a?os ha sido escandaloso el robo que se ha hecho a directores o productores. En 1998 Titanic venci a L.A.Confidential. ?Quin en su sano juicio pensara que Cameron podra vencer en terminos de cinematografa a Curtis Hanson, sin embarlo la historia pone a cada uno en su lugar. Hoy por hoy L.A. es considerada una obra maestra, al nivel de los Godfader o de Goodfellas que en 1991 perdi con Dances with Wolves de Kevin Costner. Es hasta este a?o que se le da a Scorsesse  que ni con Gang of New York, Cape Fear o sus incontables trabajos nominados lo que se le haba negado. ?Puedes imaginar a Rocky venciendo en 1977 a Taxi Driver? No, no creo que se trata de simplemente Alemania es mas conveniente que Mxico. No podemos perder de vista que jams en la historia de este evento Mxico haba tenido un nmero tan alto de nominaciones, tampco que Pam's Laberinth se llev tres estatuillas, cosa que no recuerdo que cinta alguna mexicana se haya llevado jams. Seamos mesurados, ?claro que deseabamos que Del Toro y Gonzales I?arritu se hubieran llevado todos los premios donde se les nomin! Pero como inicie comentando an grandes directores como el mismisimo George Lucas, quin tiene garantizado un lugar en la historia del cine, jams gan un Oscar en sus nicas dos nominaciones: American Graffiti y Star Wars. Sin duda para ganar el premio como dicen en Papaloapan, Ver. para subir al cielo se necesita una escalera grande y otra cosita. Esa cosita a veces requiere de muchos a?os de trabajo, dedicacin compromiso, empe?o.  Para terminar, no creo que trabajos de esa envergadura se dise?an y se contruyen teniendo como nico objetivo el ganar dicho premio. El cine como cualquier otra expresin de arte, adems de tener un valor comercial, tiene un valor esttico y espiritual. Si han cometido este ltimo proposito entonces estn en el camino de la trascendencia y la valoracin a mediano y largo plazo. Larga vida al cine mexicano, americano, alemn o iran, siempre que sea un vehiculo para llevarnos a la refleccin intelectual, al disfrute estetico y al gozo espiritual.|`|6e13560cb3ba20ba835f0eb283bf8549aa	por mameis por que no saben li que es el cine bueno|`|AA11301199	Por racistas , simplemente por eso .

La mejor graciosada que le hoy decir es cuando Bart y Homero trabajan en el circo y lo quieren sobornar y el le dice a Homero.    A quien busco es a biletin vio usted un billetin por aqui no el es bart.  quien yo estoy buscando es a don soborno gi?o gi?o.

SlipKnoT (their last two albums are a little meh, i like the last three better. in case anybodies like "there were only 4" they had another album before SlipKnoT called Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat.)  2. Mushroomhead   3. Ko?n   4. In Flames  5. Static-X  6. Disturbed  7. Devildriver  8. Slayer  9.

Just made me think 'WTF?'|`|cVQMVwmtaa	those were really good   i like 5, 6, 11, 12, 13, 14   post more!|`|42semosXaa	You said it!  1.,3,4,5,8,12,16,18,20|`|7OE7ZNZsaa	loll i like em    except number 5, even those are taken now!|`|85ad34ad33cf2e5e39bf47dedc67c559aa	Ha-Ha!

rFBypeEfaa	Cheap Trick - I Want You to Want Me    Even the band would tell you so; they hate the studio version(s)...|`|6aDXv5iVaa	"Precious Things" Tori Amos  "Jane Says" Jane's Addiction  "Ghost Rider" Henry Rollins   "Iron Man" Ozzy Osbourne  "Breakdown" Tom Petty  "Chocolate" Sarah Maclachlan|`|CZszdtemaa	Metallica - Frantic.    The album version is amazing anyway. Just the drums sound better live. If you youtube it check the one from korea '06.|`|y1xPK3Txaa	Not really a song, but a whole album really.    Queensryche's Operation: Mindcrime is tons better live.  IMO, if you ever get Livecrime there is a very small chance that you'll be able to listen to the studio album again.  The live version is way more energetic, and basically way better sounding.|`|7fe2e12eefd613a85a2294cb674aea83aa	Most songs are!  If the band is technically proficient enough to pull of what they recorded in the studio they can add a live element to an already great song which adds to the excitement. Some good examples:    Goodnight Saigon - Billy Joel  Born To Run - Bruce Springsteen  New York Minute - The Eagles  Crush - Dave Matthews

xuV1xsImaa	I feel bad for the people writing these stupid stories cause apparently they  don't have the talent to write about something that is actually meaningful.    I do think it is more than just a few pounds, but i still think she looks hot! She is gorgeous even at a larger size. She represents the average American girl now.     I know she works with a trainer and eats healthy so i wonder if she is doing it as an image thing, or maybe for a movie role.|`|k39bNUgeaa	No because the pictures isn't just a few pounds    Its a lot she is big now|`|mZcdC90Uaa	Well I don't really feel bad. It depends on how she takes it. She can let a couple of pounds bother her or she can say f you guys I couldn't give a flying f*ck. I do think it is pathetic they have to report about that kind of stuff but they shouldn't take it to heart either. If they did they would be in so much trouble. Britney probably wanted the attention...I mean look at her shaved head. That just screamed attention and insanity. A lot of them do need to back off though because it is like high school over blown.  Stefani|`|cY8DgJv5aa	No, I don't feel bad for her.  This is not the first time people have commented on her weight.  When she was younger, she was always scrutinized for her "curves" and everyone wanted her to be thinner.  Surely she's use to it by now and I doubt it really bothers her all that much.      If a read a bunch of magazines right this moment that talked about how fat I was, it wouldn't bother me in the least nor would I want anyone feeling bad for me.  Yes, I'm not as thin as other people.  Yes, I've put on a few pounds lately.  Thanks for pointing out the obvious, geniuses.  lol  Surely she can take all those judgments with a grain of salt just like I can.  If weight gain is the biggest thing they have to gossip about (no pun intended), then she's doing just fine.  I'd rather have my weight issues smeared all over the magazines then my personal life.  She's had both, so I'm sure this is a nice break.|`|jd14u32qaa	That's more than 'just a few pounds'.  A few pounds is what happens after the holidays.  But, like I said in another answer, she is just as, in not more, famous for her appearance as for her 'talent'.  There are any number of 'less attractive' women who can sing as well as, likely better, than Jessica Simpson but they don't get noticed because they don't look like she does, or did.  When her popularity is derived in large part from her appearance, her appearance is open to scrutiny.

Maintenant c'est vrai qu'il ne prsente pas les infos "chaudes" comme le fait le 20h, mais il en parle quand mme quand c'est important.  De toute fa?on le journal de 13h est beaucoup moins regard que le 20h, et vise un public diffrent.   Il n'y a aucun mal  ?a.

Mais Pernault c'est vraiment le pompon!!    Marjojo: "Perso je trouve agrable ce journal qui nous fait dcouvrir d'autres choses."  Oui bien s?r, mais le problme c'est que les sujets que nous prsente Pernault ont leur place dans un magazine, pas dans un journal tlvis. Le but d'un JT est de traiter l'information. Et s'il l'actualit c'est les guerres, et ben on parle des guerres; d'ailleurs ?a permettrait peut tre d'viter ou arrter certains conflits, si on les connaissait vraiment et si les journalistes faisaient leur boulot...

One day, you will find your edward, he may not be as perfect as he seems in the movies, but he will be real and he will be yours. Edward, charming as he may seem, is a fictional, made up character within the pages of a book and scenes of a movie. It is okay to think he is great, but don't obsess over him, live in reality and things may work out for you better than they will if you just obsess over edward.

Here let me tell you about vampires.  It all started when Dracula sold his soul to the devil so that he could be immortal, but he had to consume others blood (or life force) in order to maintain his mortality.  vampires  don't have mind or souls (that is why they are invisible in mirrors, because people used to think that mirrors reflect the soul) and normal people don't fall in love with soulless monsters.  Does that help turn you off?|`|cRMl6VHYaa	omg! my friend is in love with him too when i saw the question i thought it was my friend.don't worry its normal.trust me we all dream just take a breath and think of reality. its fine.|`|0FiKloExaa	Shut up.

I know a girl who went as far as to say "Bella's no longer with him,  he's mine, he's proposed to me, etcetc."  She likes to refer to him as "Ed" or "Eddie"...I think he'd prefer "Edward", knowing the character. I love the books,  I really do,  but the fangirls who think Edward is their man seem a little crazy as Edward is fictional and even so,  he is Bella's, so, end of story.    Now that I have that out of my system,  let's get into a little psychology.  Girls become obsessed with guys (Fictional, musical artists, and so on) because they need an escape.  It's been proven that the most difficult time (emotionally) is the teenage years.  There's a lot of pressure, lots of confusion.  Boys their age are hormone driven.  I'm sure you know what I'm getting at.  Edward Cullen is a mature, charming and dazzling character.  He's nothing like some boys can get in high school.  He's also fictional, but that's escapism for you.  If being in love and dreaming you're with Edward or any other fictional guy makes you happy, what the hell,  go for it if it keeps you sane (In your eyes of course,  others may think otherwise.)  But don't be overly obsessive (Like cutting Bella's face from the movie poster image and replacing her face with yours,  I've seen that...Yikes.)  Try not to annoy too many people.|`|HUdCBaJ0aa	its ok to like fic characters but edward is so overrated

ROfi95d4aa	If you're looking to expand your horizions, go to your local library and check out a book. Anything with "encyclopedia of classical music" in the title will do nicely. Then, read on composers and listen to the music on YouTube.|`|Wi0LBsVbaa	Similar? There's not that much. In Wagner, there's the Flying Dutchman Overture. Entrance of the Gods into Valhalla, Siegfried's Death and Funeral March.  They have all the horns and drama, but not quite the boisterousness of the "Ride"  The opening of the final movement of Anton Bruckner's symphony  8 is about the closest in spirit. Bruckner knew Wagner, and idolized him, Wagner liked Bruckner's music quite a bit. (Mahler did also). If the "Ride" is appropriate for assault helicopters, the Bruckner would be for fighter/bombers. Other Bruckner would be the 4th symphony movements 1 and 3.  You might like Ottorino Respighi, when I want to blast pure thunder, part of his Botticelli Pictures is speaker blower. You might enjoy his Pines of Rome, last part, which depicts the Roman army emerging from ancient mists and marching down the Appian Way. (best recording is still an old RCA Fritz Reiner recording, you can get cheap).  These pieces have quiet parts, you might like those though too,  Also Gustav Holst's the Planets, it has quiet parts, but the first part; Mars the God of War, directly influenced John Williams in his music depicting the imperial cruiser in Star Wars. You should also like Jupiter and Uranus.   When you tire of these, there is Strauss's Also Sprach Zarathustra (2001 space oddessy uses the beginning, but other parts are loud and chaotic), and Mahler's 5th, symphony, third movement. Don't tell anyone I said this, since I enjoy teasing Mahler-heads, but it is the best scherzo written in the 20th century, and is delightfully manic depressive.|`|4BKmxPcPaa	WWW.PANDORA.COM    WWW.ALLMUSIC.COM    ( THERE YOU'LL GET SONGS AND ARTISTS THAT ARE SIMILAR )

AA11852077	I believe it's volume 17.    :]|`|8a65aa558e9ad4329fd6cecf8635eb04aa	are you serious?! omg, i've only seen the anime version....this has made me want to read the manga!! is that why Akito was so mean? he's jealous?
JCdudGx7aa	Assuming that you're just going to play the melody (without accompaniment), you can just read the treble clef as is.  To transpose from bass clef to treble clef, simply place the note one line or one space higher.    Now, lets say you want to play with accompaniment.  Here's where it gets a little tricky, but it certainly isn't impossible:    To transpose from treble clef Concert Pitch (piano pitch) to Bb (Clarinet's pitch), put the note one full step higher, to the line or space immediately above the written pitch.  Then, add two sharps to the key signature.  Transposing from bass clef concert pitch to Bb is relatively the same, but you need to take the earlier step of transposing from Bass to Treble clef into account.    This can be time consuming. But, it will get you the result you're looking for.|`|m1BF50Nmaa	They are the same notes|`|yuF2K1rLaa	Check this conversion video on youtube out.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRH...|`|JXAgD52Aaa	i would just trasfer teh melody onto the treble cleft|`|XwacWyy6aa	Its just the same isn't it?  Just follow the treble clef.  I'm not 100% sure though as I don't play the clarinet.|`|vR6AwIppaa	they're the same notes.|`|42n3SEPOaa	Every note on the staff of piano music needs to be 1 whole step higher to be considered clarinet music. Note however, that the piano is a chordal instrument: it can play more than one note at a time. Clarinets cannot do this, so you may not be able to transfer the piano music to be read as clarinet music.
wXx9bGTzaa	Yo...  this track makes me so nostalgic... lol    The beat is like the first version, without any bass, and drums that don't hit as hard.    But it is hot... Rae flow is too lazy to recall thoughts of the original, but lyrically he's still on it.    And Ghost killed it... that verse was crazy...    I'm trying not to anticipate OB4CL2, cuz it will probably be pushed back again, but it's hard not to...    April 4th...|`|reXfpsQgaa	Love it, They both spit fire but ghost killed it.

This track is still hot though and it's already been on repeat on my iPod for the last hour or so.|`|m2UUrurBaa	i dont even want to listen, because i know i'm going to get hype, and once i get hype the album won't drop until 2011......F**k i'll risk it.      @scientist, i peeped that on 8 diagrams, i thought he might of been upset with the production....Now he sounds like reverend love joy off the simpsons.

GFf3Pim6aa	*panic* This Q has only just shown up on my list!!!!!    I've got loads and loads because I love film scores..my first was a double album of Star Wars which I placed transfers ( free from Ready Brek ) all over the cover :-)    Right If I had to pick just one it is this~http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=YwkuS9FlB7... -Ryuichi Sakamoto-Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence. I think it is as near to perfection as it is possible to be. I bloody love it and still feel the same when I hear it as I did the first time. Makes my heart race.    Also~  Witness  Pride And Prejudice (most recent version)  Schindler's List  Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon    EDIT-nearly forgot...Muppet Christmas Carol ! I ain't joking I love the songs..top notch christmassy cringle :-)|`|CwDcCImmaa	My personal favourite is Philip Glass' music for the Truman Show    Oh...and anyone who said Lord of the Rings i might have to burn your house down - it's just the same theme repeated over and over again in different ways!!!|`|WOdsVfiXaa	I like all the 'I Am Legend' pieces and 'The Da Vinci Code' music aswell|`|kdBxtEdcaa	Amadeus. The movie.    All genuine Mozart music throughout.  Wonderful!|`|BdhOvKaAaa	Soundtrack to "Gladiator"|`|Sx0ha3gBaa	I don't think the music from modern films can be called 'classical' but I think both scores from Ennio Morricone for 'Once upon a time in America', and 'Once upon a time in the West'  are very evocative .As for Classical music. I prefer Haydn over Mozart .|`|bFT9EinFaa	I absolutely love the film score from the new "Pride & Prejudice" - it is breathtakingly beautiful!    And, although I'm not sure this counts as classical :) the sound track to the Titanic is simply amazing.|`|nGytpZSdaa	Well for me it has simply got to be 'The Hours' classical sound track by Philip Glass. It is amazingly beautiful music. His music is based on repetition of harmonies, and motifs but it is simply breath-taking.(sometimes simple is best)! Get the sound track and i'd bet you'd discover some truly great music, if you hadn't listened to his struff before! I wouldn't consider his music classical however, I think modern music with a 'classical twist' for film would be a more accurate description. Classical=Beethoven, mozart, Haydn etc.....sorry not debating though!!!!|`|CWejvYyuaa	I love the soundtracks to Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Batman Begins and The Dark Knight|`|pZfxAG5Baa	The soundtrack to 'House of Flying Daggers', it's truly sensational.|`|iMpSfBblaa	For me...Dances with Wolves, or Out of Africa. For sheer emotion.      I'm picking from purely film music now, though.       And I know this isn't technically 'classical', but I love the Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon score, by Tan Dun. He composed it in two weeks. Two weeks!|`|jbAr62ybaa	For me it's very difficult to choose one; but if I must, it would have to be "Gone with the Wind":    http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=PgF-rcHcPq...         As music composed solely for a motion picture production, this one is hard to top in my opinion.                                                         Alberich|`|6PQOjBrYaa	frank zappa /200 motels  oh in case you think frank zappa is a rock musician? he is !  200 motels  is heavily influenced by modern composer varese.|`|NWwKrrC3aa	Shine     Edward scissorhands    both really beautiful!|`|jgEvnYNlaa	Bellas Lullaby from Twilight|`|tuATxHsVaa	Amadeus!!!    Bernard Herman's film scores are fantastic. The score to Psycho is very good.    And of course I have to give credit to John Williams for writing the score to Star Wars.|`|ccEWxExfaa	Philadelphia  I loved the entire score even the non-classical but  the most haunting scene for me was Tom Hanks  alone being totally absorbed by the music.|`|bDPU6qWiaa	i love mozart 21 and also slaves chorus from nabucco|`|nwRG3N8Maa	Menum Corpus from Hannibal|`|OxWmtBSYaa	From the Disney classic, "Beauty and the Beast," the instrumental score at the very beginning, titled "Prologue" by Alan Menken is haunting...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9i3xWTEK...|`|AA11261367	Barry Lyndon's musical score|`|CuMYdQV6aa	I agree with Genastra. Philip Glass has produced some amazing film scores, including 'Koyaanisqatsi'. Newman's music for 'Road to Perdition' was extraordinary too.|`|xcPzZvsraa	Picking one is hard but it's  probably a choice between these three:    1 - Michael Mann's "Heat" music score composed by Elliot Goldenthal    2 - Steven Spielberg's "Schindlers List" music composed by John Williams.    3 - Darren Aronofsky's "Requiem For A Dream" score composed by Clint Mansell.    Of recent films that stand out I think:  Paul Thomas Anderson's "There Will Be Blood" score composed by Johnny Greenwood is a real gem.      I've also found that the movies of David Lynch are usually accompanied by a great atmospheric soundtrack,  the "Elephant Man" & "Mulholland Drive" two superb examples.  Long time associate Angelo Badalamenti being the composer for the latter.

6T7yX1U7aa	They aren't casting Leah Clearwater, at all. She will not be in New Moon, Melissa Rosenberg stated that she did not even write her into the script. If they did, I think Freida Pinto would be a good Leah, she's not Native American but hey, neither is Taylor Lautner. And I think Dakota Fanning would make an excellent addition, especially as Jane.

I'm a Virgo also a Goat.|`|LrKCLZF7aa	It's kind of an ambiguous question. Animal Sign. So let's get a few things straight. The Virgo is the Virgin. A Woman. We separate ourselves from the animal kingdom and don't consider ourselves mere animals.    There are people that are claiming that the Virgo is the Snake. But this is not right. The Rat begins at the North which is the place of Sagittarius not Aries. Aries is of from the east where the sun rises.    Chinese Equivalent to the Virgo is the Rooster. The Native American equivalent is the Bear. Kanya in Vedic which just means the virgin. I think that covers it. 10 points please.|`|ETQ3nIOeaa	the fishes|`|UnuRaYbjaa	animal sign for a virgo, its a lady im a virgo 2|`|YjFDfp5Paa	Bushbaby|`|Eq5fgLEJaa	a lady with a jug|`|HijQu2lAaa	virgo-the virgin-fishes.|`|XXi3D7Azaa	The Virgin or The Snake in China|`|rOPWvC02aa	it is hard because every site has so many different answers.

She sings a good version of "Amazing Grace". You can look this up on You Tube. The live version is best I think.    Sissel from Norway is a talented versatile singer of pop songs and classical music. Again, you can watch her singing Andrew Lloyd Webber's Pie Jesu on You Tube. Gorgeous!

74029fdf261ab07bdee856f8426364b2aa	If you're trying to get sides for a new show for audition purposes, you might want to try registering on actor websites such as Now Casting,L.A. Casting, Actors Access or Backstage.com. I especially recommend L.A. Casting's library of sides. You can choose any type of sides from commercials to features and print them up at your leisure. However, I must stress that a) most of the sides are dated and have been used on projects that have long since been completed and b) you must be a registered (and paying) member in order to access them as with the other services. If you join any or all of these services,join at the minimum level,which,for some is usually around $10.00 per month. If you need sides for a current or upcoming project, the poster will direct you to the proper section to download the material. Hope this helps you out. Good luck on your audition!|`|QT8vmBfsaa	hold an audition

I believe it has to do with his life style all these years. You know drugs, booze. Kind of like good old Ozzy Osbourne. I didn't know that Rourke had any money left.

I think it's great he may have made a come back.|`|e248fbf4bda3b339c8800122c1551870aa	Probably, because that's what ALL the Hollywood people do.

Listen to some Beatles, Three Days Grace, MCR, Linkin Park, Metallica, AC/DC, Evanescence, maybe some Korn...you should listen to some real music. Camp rock was total crap. The Jonas Sisters are all gay. They only have purity rings because they can't get any. The Jonas Brothers are only famous because of Disney. They can stick their ugly noses in every event I love and ruin it. At least the Naked Brothers aren't plastered all over my tv when I watch movies on Disney station. JB annoys me a lot more. Their fans are a lot stupider. They always come on Yahoo and ask...what is their phone number? What is their favorite color? Do they like gay s*x....opps that is my question but get the picture?  Stefani|`|k39bNUgeaa	They both suck so bad    Both are talentless|`|KBCFVZVNaa	I love the Jonas Brothers!!!!!|`|JXAgD52Aaa	i dont like either but the naked brothers are way more annoying to hear|`|LRLu1ofNaa	They both suck.    Just saying, but almost everyone has hair. It's not the Naked Brothers Band's fault that their hair looks like the Jonas Brothers. It looks horrible on both of them.    All bands have to have a drummer, a guitarist, etc. Not just your precious Jonas Brothers.    The Naked Brothers band are brothers too. Many other bands have "brothers" in their name.    The Jonas Brothers are NOT rockstars. They are crappy little popstars.    The Jonas Brothers don't have a reason to be famous, either.    The Jonas Brothers show isn't going to be much better.    I don't agree with you. Both the Naked Brothers Band and The Jonas Brothers are horrible.|`|sz1YqwUEaa	And the Jonas brothers are a Copy of Hanson now be quite they all suck.|`|DP4TH7Qzaa	I THINK THAT BOTH BANDS ARE A BUNCH OF CRAP AND REALLY SUCK AND I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY'RE  FAMOUS.|`|pWDKcvAJaa	the nbb didnt copy the jonas bros. they had the band before the jobros were known  i used to like them but personally i think they are a little overrated.  im a big fan of the jonas brothers myself|`|w7G3PVIuaa	I'm not a big fan of either but the Naked Bros were before the Jo Bros so they didn't copy, the other way around if you actually wanna get technical, and maybe the Jo Bros are the Naked Bro's insperation|`|mRQ6D0Ipaa	yeah i think so too but naked brothers are signed up with nickloedian so they r going to get no where|`|hkBFRZu8aa	oh man i totally think the nbb are bad copies of jb. the nbb are HORRRRRRIBLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE with no musical talent EVER        its just that disney has the jonas brothers, so nickelodean wants to have the naked brothers bad as their "big thing"|`|tKRLTmssaa	Never heard of them tbh  Jonas Brothers are just as bad    there only famous because of disney and cause there 'hot'  i severly doubt there copying them honestly,  now my advice is don't ask a jonas brothers question on yahoo answers and just listen to them instead of questioning people copying them.    i love escape the fate though aha|`|vOrPdPHyaa	the naked brothers are a copy.

They are designed poorly so the head or neck breaks. Any other guitar will work for what you want to do but Strat's, Tele's and some of the more metal based guitars like Jackson, BC Rich and Ibanez are good as well|`|C156l7vWaa	Acoustic-sound is not amplified or distorted, 6 strings    Electric-sound is amplified or distorted, 6 strings    Bass-produces a sound that is lower than a guitar, 4 strings    Classical-a style of guitar playing, not a guitar itself    You gotta decide what you wanna play first, depends on what sound you like best too. I personally have an acoustic http://www.woodbrass.com/images/woodbras... (minus the swirly pick guard, its just all black, with gold tuning knobs) and an electric Dean Vendetta http://cachepe.samedaymusic.com/media/qu...    I personally would typically stay away from Fender because they are usually of cheaper quality. Just go to a guitar store and the ppl working there can help you sooo much.|`|NbmTMXQJaa	Okay, so if you wanna play classic music like that, I'd say either get a decent acoustic, or get a guitar made for classic rock, like a Fender Stratocaster or Gibson Les Paul. Those are pretty advanced guitars to buy as a beginner, but if you have the money for them, and you are dedicate to learn and play, I'd buy them. They are top of the line. Another expensive, yet good guitar for that music would be a Fender Telecaster. Epiphones are a nice brand for their prices. You can find a decent Epiphone Les Paul for a good price. I hope I've helped a little. I don't know much about classic rock, so I tried as hard as possible to help you out

P9wB5Epdaa	I highly recommend it if you're not easily bothered by gore and nudity. I have never seen a series so cruel and yet so beautiful at the same time.    I was shocked for a few days after finishing the series, that's how powerfully moving Elfen Lied is. I would also recommend to watch it with subtitles but if you prefer the dubs they're not that bad but not great also.    It's quite a gem, a must see for fans of mature anime.    "Cruelty carries deep emotions."|`|81FeFJ3Caa	Its about a diclonus that kills alotta ppl if you have a weak stomach dont watch but it really is a good show you actually FEEL for the main character      LOTS-O-GORE|`|Hiasgb75aa	The Diclonius, a mutated homo sapien that is said to be selected by God and will eventually become the destruction of mankind, possesses two horns in their heads, and has a "sixth sense" which gives it telekinetic abilities. Due to this dangerous power, they have been captured and isolated in laboratories by the government. Lucy, a young and psychotic Diclonius, manages to break free of her confines and brutally murder most of the guards in the laboratory, only to get shot in the head as she makes her escape. She survives and manages to drift along to a beach, where two teenagers named Kohta and Yuka discovers her. Having lost her memories, she was named after the only thing that she can now say, "Nyuu," and the two allow her to stay at Kohta's home. However, it appears that the evil "Lucy" is not dead just yet...    I highly recommend it. Its gory though, if you don't mind limbs being torn off its fine

Sometimes it takes awhile for a series to get started, but I think once they get the first episode sub out, it will start to go a lot more smoothly.    In the meantime, here is the group that gives the link to the RAW and I think they will tell us when the subs are out and where to find them.

17af954fbe27baa0ee9ad49771e1dd9caa	Two Texas ranch hands, Jim and Bob, are sitting at their favorite bar, drinking beer.  Jim turns to Bob and says, "You know, I'm tired of going through life without an education.  Tomorrow I think I'll go to the community college and sign up for some classes.     Bob thinks it's a good idea, and the two leave.     The next day Jim goes down to the college and meets the dean of admissions, who signs him up for the four basic classes: Math, English, History, and Logic.  "Logic?" Jim says.  "What's that?"  The dean says, "I'll show you.  Do you own a weed eater?"  "Yeah."  "Then logically because you own a weed eater, I think that you would have a yard."  "That's true, I do have a yard."  "I'm not done," the dean says.  "Because you have a yard, I think logically that you would have a house."  "Yes, I do have a house."  "And because you have a house, I think that you might logically have a family."  "I have a family."  "I'm not done yet.  Because you have a family, then logically you must have a wife."  "Yes, I do have a wife."  "And because you have a wife, then logically you must be a heterosexual."  "I am a heterosexual.  That's amazing, you were able to find out all of that because I have a weed eater."     Excited to take the class now, Jim shakes the dean's hand and leaves to go meet Bob at the bar.  He tells Bob about his classes, how he is signed up for Math, English, History, and Logic.     "Logic?" Bob says, "What's that?"  Jim says, "I'll show you.  Do you have a weed eater?"  "No."   "Then you're a queer."|`|4033b6b06a2fd56f0435794d8dcec6e0aa	A preacher retired and moved to the country to enjoy life and practice his hobby of yard work. Needing a lawn mower, he headed into town to buy one. On the way he saw a sign advertising a lawn mower for sale. He stopped at the house and a young lad came out to greet him. The preacher asked about the lawn mower and the kid said it was behind the house. The two went to look at the lawn mower. The engine was sputtering along at idle speed. The preacher increased the speed of the engine and mowed a few strips. Satisfied that the mower would do the job they settled on a price of ?25.00. Later in the day, the young lad was riding his bicycle when he spied the preacher pulling on the engine starter rope. The kid stopped and watched for a couple of minutes. He asked, "What's wrong?" The reply came, "I can't get this mower started. Do you know how?" The kid said, "Yep." "Well, how do you do it? Tell me!", the preacher yelled. The kid replied, "You have to cuss it." The preacher rose up indignantly. "Now you listen here. I am a preacher and if I ever did cuss, not saying I have, I've forgotten how to do it after all these years."  With a wise look on his face well beyond his years, the kid said, "Preacher, you keep on pulling that rope and it'll all come back to ya."    * The priest was preparing a dying man for his voyage into the great beyond. Whispering firmly, the priest said, "Denounce the devil! Let him know how little you think of his evil!" The dying man said nothing. The priest repeated his order. Still the dying man said nothing. The priest asked, "Why do you refuse to denounce the devil and his evil?"  The dying man said, "Until I know where I'm heading, I don't think I ought to aggravate anybody."      ** A clergyman walking down a country lane and sees a young farmer struggling to load hay back onto a cart after it had fallen off.  "You look hot, my son," said the cleric. "why don't you rest a moment, and I'll give you a hand."  "No thanks," said the young man. "My father wouldn't like it."  "Don't be silly," the minister said. "Everyone is entitled to a break. Come and have a drink of water."  Again the young man protested that his father would be upset. Losing his patience, the clergyman said, "Your father must be a real slave driver. Tell me where I can find him and I'll give him a piece of my mind!  "Well," replied the young farmer, "he's under the load of hay."    ** A minister, a priest and a rabbi went for a hike one day. It was very hot.They were sweating and exhausted when they came upon a small lake. Since it was fairly secluded, they took off all their clothes and jumped in the water.  Feeling refreshed, the trio decided to pick a few berries while enjoying their "freedom." As they were crossing an open area, who should come along but a group of ladies from town. Unable to get to their clothes in time, the minister and the priest covered their privates and the rabbi covered his face while they ran for cover.  After the ladies had left and the men got their clothes back on, the minister and the priest asked the rabbi why he covered his face rather than his privates. The rabbi replied,  "I don't know about you, but in MY congregation, it's my face they would recognize."|`|AA11491405	Why did the blonde change her baby's diaper once a week?

They get captured by a tribe of cannibals. Naturally, they don't want to get eaten so they beg for mercy. The leader of the tribe decides to take mercy on them and decides to have them play a game for their fate. He explains the first part of the rules to them "Go into that forest and find a type of fruit and come back with 10 pieces of that fruit." and the men go off.  The first man comes back with apples and asks the king what happens next. The king tells him the second part of the rules "You must put all of the apples up your butt without expressing emotion (i.e. pain, confusion, sleepiness)". The first man is scared as hell but figures it's this or being eaten so he begins. He gets to the second apple and bursts out in pain and is killed and eaten.  The second man comes back with berries. The king explains the rules to him, and he begins. During the ninth berry, he bursts out laughing and is killed and eaten.  The two men meet up in heaven and the first man asks the second man "Why did you laugh? You almost won!" and the second man replies "I couldn't help it!

AA11042414	i am truly shocked! there is small consolation that she may be with her son now, she mourned him so deeply. i understand society's impulse to attack, but i believe that we should forgive all misdeeds of life in death. she just has not been "herself" since daniel died. she always had a media strength and exuberance that shined through everything. it seemed that something significant within her died with him. i hope she is at peace. my deepest sympathies go out to mr. stern and danilynn. it was clear through the recent interviews that he cared deeply for her with all of his efforts (however futile) to protect her in the recent media blitz over her children and personal tragedies.     goodbye anna nicole, and god speed.|`|9e31e3e33beaad2d02394971c39a6c40aa	I wonder...

0bda661e8f50a86807a227efbd179782aa	C'est une chanson avant tout humoristique ( prendre au second degr ...).    J'aime bien l'couter et je trouve que vraiment cet artiste a beaucoup de talent et il a su parler de ce problme d'une fa?on vraiment intressante.  Je te conseille un film "Africa Paradis" il passe en ce moment au cinma, n'est pas trs connu mais si tu as aim la chanson de Kamini pour ses ides tu vas adorer.      Certaines personnes trouvent que c'est une chanson raciste envers les blancs, mais personnellement je suis "blanche" et je ne me sens pas vise ... alors ...    Je vais mme ajouter, je suis fille de gendarme (c'est quand mme pas si loin de la police) et bien j'ai bien rit en voyant le clip avec les rpliques des policiers ;).    De toute fa?on mme si le racisme anti-blanc existe, aucun blanc ne souffre de racisme en France, ou de discrimination face  l'emploi, au logement  cause de sa couleur de peau !    Sincrement je ne pense pas que Kamini soit raciste, il a tent de faire de l'humour en melant  la fois des clichs pour les dmonter et des faits rels (discrimination).|`|50612bff3811300f40e8b209b583e304aa	c'est carrement raciste, dans l'autre sens on aurait eu SOS racisme qui aurait fait un procs|`|67ba90f7417dde4cbac868a3fba41b0baa	On peut analyser certains lments du videoclip.      Entre autre :  tant blanc, il se rend compte qu'il est d?u de son engin sexuel.  (imaginez si  l'inverse, il se rend compte que maintenant son cerveau est plus gros).    Racisme anti-blanc?

Je suis d'un village  cot de Marly Gomont... tout ce qu'il a dit sur Marly, c'est vrai... c'est un coin paum...ya rien! beaucoup ailleurs se plaignent d'aise!   Mais  force de trop jouer sur le "je suis un pauv' black dans un monde de blancs"... je trouve qu'il y va fort!   C'est pas la faute des blancs si on est pas arrt... et pis se foutre de notre fa?on de parler... vous trouvez pas ?a un peu fort? il imite plus paris XVI que Marly Gomont comme accent... et tous les blancs ne parlent justement pas comme  Paris XVI...    Enfin voil... je trouve ?a trs dr?le comme clip, comme musique... mais le message en fond, subliminable ne me plait gure!|`|EmRvtuEPaa	moi perso jaime la musique   mais je peux pas dire si c une chanson rasiste ou pas   m je pense que marly-gomont et mieux|`|19c9a655639ba01878790a88ac540e36aa	j'en pense que j'en ai assez d'entendre dire que les autres sont des racistes, c'est lassant, fatiguant.|`|2d7144133fcc6a4266e0c275cece752baa	Autant Marly Gomont tait saoulante ( force de l'entendre tourner partout, hein, parsqu' la base c'tait bien vu comme ide) et la prod ridicule, autant je trouve celle l beaucoup plus travaille (il aurait quand mme pu se fendre d'un autre couplet)    - Une prod plus aboutie musicalement  - Un texte plus dr?le  - Un thme qui drange un peu plus mes amis franchouillards, et ?a j'aime.

7fa2c498c7e87062411338243755f895aa	So you are looking for free PSP downloads? There is one thing you need to understand first: there is nothing like a free PSP download. Of course there are free PSP download sites, but they are illegal and you will be getting into BIG trouble using these services.    But there are other sites that offer free PSP downloads that are legal. You only have to pay a onetime membership fee. After that you may download as many PSP songs, games, and movies as you can handle forthe rest of your life Membership to these donwload sites is low and varies. You will have to pay around $30 for unlimited access.    So once you paid your membership fee you have free PSP downloads for life.

It's true amongst the "unattractives" overweight people are included. But if you are overweight and turned down for the job b/c you feel that your weight prevented you from obtaining the job then you can definitely position a law suit. Given that you were qualified for the job in the first place. |`|UWK1OOUEaa	Don't worry about that at all..i'm not sure what 10 stone is but i do know if you didn't get the job that would be discrimination.

Honestly, as long as you are confident and show good customer skills, they will not care about weight.    True, they say looks make a first impression but all that means is you need to show you are well-groomed and care about your appearance- weight isn't really a factor at all.   |`|4zX5BO1baa	don't worry I dont think they'll care about ...your weight. and you're not that heavy.

I don't do Ribbons !!!!|`|kqiDmW5Daa	For kids, don't do bows or ribbons. They aren't going to notice Christmas morning anyway and it will save you tons of stress.

I just thought my Daughter my be along soon & dispute that. lol  I like to wrap though, I am an offset printer, when I started at 16 we used to wrap everything in tar paper & string, no tape.  All the edges neatly creased, flaps & overlaps even & square & the string or ribbon uniform in spacing & tension.  Nice clean clearly printed labels on front & back.   Make sure you are wrapping on a solid surface, a table not the carpet. lol  Have fun :)  |`|jYmvtUC5aa	..hmm, have couple shots of good whiskey and start over....breathe...|`|AA11241794	Wrap the damn gift up however.

I am a lousy gift wrapper but I go out of my way and spend hours and hours looking for the perfect present for everyone I know well.. the outside is rotten.. I just wrap it any way I can and my cat tries to help me which doesn't actually make the present look more graceful in it's gift wrap.. I believe it's the thought that counts and to give a gift that I know the person likes and I sometimes spend a whole Saturday just to look for that one thing that I know would be the ideal gift. but how I wrap it.. with a lot of tape and the Japanese have an art of wrapping gifts.. they are very talented with such things.. you see the wrapping and it looks like a work of art.. or even the Chinese are good at that.. then when you open it.. there is a tiny gift inside it.. the actual gift was the time they spent to make a masterpiece of the wrapping because they are the best at origami and anything that involves making a gift really look too great so that one doesn't want to spoil this artwork of creativity they put into wrapping it..|`|n1gwpYNoaa	i got skills in gift wrapping, its the actual gift buying that I have difficulties with.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	My boyfriend does the wrapping.I have no patience.And When I do wrap them well they are not surprises anymore.I miss some spots.|`|PizXrl2oaa	i start out being a great "gift wrapper" but then end up rolling the gifts in "wrapping paper" and stretching the "wrapping tape" all around it.

Everday several days before xmas my husband and I wrap gifts at night when the kids are sleeping and hide them around the house.  Because if the kids see them they will bug us to death to let them open it.  Then the night before xmas we put the kids to sleep and stay up by the tree and can't wait until the kids see everything.  It is great.  Sorry you are stressed over it.  And if it is not the best wrapping get a gift bag and tissue paper and call it a day.|`|GOMThToVaa	Depends on how many times the paper rips the tape sticks in the wrong spot and how many times I loose the damn scissors that I just had and set down just 2 seconds ago!|`|NhCHmOfMaa	I am so proud of myself.. i wrapped a little square box perfect the other day hahahahaha|`|e8851b9f0ff261603f2a648b1ce253ccaa	I use to have others do it for me.

My 6 year old can wrap big boxes better than me!|`|hXxZ2kVfaa	i guess i am a pretty good gift wrapper haha 
99kYSEp0aa	Yes, I would. I love my two sisters, even if they do get on me nerves sometimes. =D|`|mkpKfpGQaa	yeah, of course...|`|iFYIqk0aaa	nope|`|3iFYX1SUaa	yes|`|AV3YACAZaa	Definitely!|`|kg4cighWaa	wouldn't you. Even though we fight a lot i love my brother and sister|`|AA10745234	i don't have any siblings, but if i did, i wouldn't ^__^|`|A7BUZiy1aa	it depends on the situation. If he did something wrong like murder somebody and ought to be shot to death by capital punishment, then obviously i wouldn't take the bullet for him.|`|WF6mVPjDaa	sure.|`|85JJfTgBaa	idk. i'm not good at makin hard decisions|`|u1fK5CuNaa	Well yeah.|`|k1We1BIFaa	Yeah, they are my cuties.|`|QFNvYVtyaa	of course without hesitation|`|c05702374b5bc85f3a1502d55060a46eaa	No, I most certainly would not. I feel like putting bullets in my 2 sisters who stole thousands of dollars worth of my property while I was in a hospital 57 days total, e.g. 2 computers, guns, an $1899 suit, some $300 shirts, 54 DVD's, etc., but why waste money on bullets when I am a martail artist who can smash bones with my hands and feet?|`|1eUe9BkOaa	yes.    you're an a.ss hole if you won't|`|AA11452842	Nope.       Thought about launching a few in his direction though..............      Why all the hate? I caught him in bed with my wife.............|`|4b02abdf3c937703e4bef5fdda9f0206aa	I would die for them, love them too much.|`|49178f1466ec5d626a8fc1819b87282eaa	i can't really say because i've never been in any sort of situation like that, but i might.  we don't always get along, but we're sisters and always will be.  that's a bond you can't break.|`|AA10269742	hell yea i'd die for him, he's the only little brother i'll ever have i love him to death even tho he's a little a$$hole sometimes lol|`|pWArTam4aa	For my brother?  Of course! I love him!!     For my sister?  No f-ing way... that ***** is on her own.  |`|7EiWSuPLaa	right now i would have to say no. i was in prison for 16 months and my sister was very mean to my wife. my 1 brother and his wife don't talk to me , i guess they don't know about blood being thicker than water , and think my wife shouldn't have contact with me when i was away and not let me home after my release. my 2nd brother is in  a world of his own. my older brother we just located about4 years ago after being gone for 43 years. so yeah i think i would not take a bullet for anyone except my grandchildren.|`|82bce41e90ec1a1ebe71a56d61363b42aa	Absolutely.|`|U4U9EvCqaa	Yes, all of em|`|Xf8Z6rJfaa	I sure would...no matter how much they might piss me off!    ;)|`|Qih2hKqkaa	I Have.|`|49453d694f826403d6e8252680ce8ddcaa	Yea id take more than one bullet for either of my siblings|`|F6sZvHRZaa	Of course!!

I'll be making a decision especially for making money immediately within a week or two at the most. If the bailout for the automotive industry doesn't go through, our economy WILL go down the tubes, we will be in a VERY deep recession sooner than later. Our money will leave the country at a more fervent pace, unemployment will be substantially higher, officially anyhow, at least at 6.8 to 7.7% or higher. We might even head into a depression and not fully recover for another three to five years at a minimum. People will lose more homes no matter what.

CMuaKItfaa	Well, congrats on a wise and sensible purchase.  To know you have the "real thing" you must look for the following.  The waist band MUST cover your navel.  If not, you may have been had.  The price is also a giveaway.  If you spent a dime over $30.00, perhaps you have been taken!  You will also know that you have purchased a knock off if your daughter EVER wears them.  That's a big give away.  To be safe, I always shop WalMart, the women's department to be sure!  If you see other women over the age of 60 purchasing the denims, you are most likely safe as well.  I wish you luck on your shopping endeavors!   Always look for pleats, and be certain the butt is plenty large for visits to the buffet eatery's and the hem must be a good inch from you ankles or cankles as it were.|`|mH7VXkkMaa	the creamed spinach stains are on the right thigh of the real ones. the knock offs just use strained peas,   and they messed up and put theirs on the left.   |`|6xF4baBEaa	The young guys stop hitting on you.|`|ukRSigFgaa	Do they have an elastic waist band? then they definitely are. :D  Oh wait, those are gramma jeans. *sigh*|`|67f34282988bfc3fb8c3c876e7296801aa	If the a** part is baggy you know they are the real thing|`|PpWosZsIaa	They are not true Mom Jeans unless you Mom sewed them by paw|`|2PTlXs9zaa	They are a size 8, not 18?|`|YfCRmWeSaa	they make your lower half look huge|`|HCL7FpTqaa	They have an elastic waist?  They are sexy mom jeans.|`|AA11082713	When the stretchy waist band is two inches above your bellybutton,they are the real thing...xxx|`|8SyUHkPXaa	ROFLMAO.      *wipes tears and monitor*      |`|kej0H1AXaa	they're true mom jeans if they have special pockets for your sagging breasts|`|IPpOd2wmaa	they should come up somewhere close to your breasts and fit loosely.  The butt should sag naturally too..and be a bit short at the bottoms.  |`|CHalwWXCaa	did you buy them in an alley from a guy with l0 watches on his arm and they're all Roolex or Droolex.|`|yWuuXd0Oaa	Do they match your leather bra & panties?|`|FgRUdQOBaa	on you it doesnt matter,   they will be sexy anyway|`|PiDHN4TOaa	This may sound a bit rude, so I apologize. When you have them on, feel the seam where you legs come together. True Mom jeans will have a little slack there, for those special times. Next check the zipper area, does it curve outward as you get toward the top? If so, they might be Mom Jeans. Almost done, check the belt area (you probably don't need a belt because you bought a size too small) are the loops about the same level as your navel? Almost a positive match for true Mom Jeans. The last test, and possibly the most important, look at your backside in the mirror, do the jeans make your butt look fat? It's hard to tell in the mirror, so ask your husband. If he says "No" they're true Mom jeans and he deserves a hug.|`|O2suF9O4aa	If they have an elastic panel in the front, they're true mom-jeans.|`|m6jE5KVUaa	Ask a teenage boy! LOL|`|4472d6c8b8a41746c6129264601312c7aa	Don't they have a label that says Mom Jeans???|`|frjSBxzBaa	you don't until you put them on and the kind of complements you get |`|amzMzYCWaa	do they say LEE on the back? Are they tight legged and have pleats?

Disclaimer: this is what we PRESENTLY know. It could change tomorrow, next week, next year, or never.    But this is what we know as of TODAY. OK?    The Universe was originally a small "ball" of matter and energy. For reasons we do not know, this "ball" expanded outward, putting 'space' between all the matter and energy. When anything expands from a tight "ball," it always expands in all directions. Like an explosion. OK? so far?    But the Universe did not expand outward in all directions. It expanded more like a flat kitchen plate, every growing wider in diamater. At the center of the 'plate' is the beginning of the expansion, moving outward is constantly developing new planets. At the 'edge' of the 'plate' is the end of the Universe. There is nothing past the edge. We are 1/2 of the way between the center, and the edge. Our planet, that is...    OK so far?    Now in nature there is "laws" that say, certain things ALWAYS happen certain ways. Including expansion. It expands outward in all directions. But the Universe did not expand this way... Which is impossible. If the Universe had expanded in all directions, eventually gravity would grab everything and start pulling everything back to it's original small ball. Everything would go backwards, including time and the Universe would cease to exist.    But an infinite being, considerably smarter than all of us, would know this, and when creating the Universe, would expand it like a plate, keeping gravity from ever getting strong enough to pull everything back again.     That is my reason for believing in God.

God performs many miracles in our lives on a daily basis but we fail to see them!!! God comes to us and helps us with our problems by finding a solution ( some of which we do not approve of ) through different people!!! |`|NllWkSDiaa	    Is God real? That is the big question. If God is not real then you can play by whatever rules you like. But if God is real then it is a whole new ballgame. It is interesting to note that the vast majority of people do believe that there is a God. George Barna, who makes a living by asking people questions like this, found that three out of four adults think that there is a God. Ask four friends and check it out for yourself. Of course the reality of God cannot be settled by majority vote.    How can we know if God is real? Wouldn't it be nice if we could pick up the telephone and give him a call? Or drive by his house just to see if his car was in the driveway? Fortunately, there are better ways to address this question. Consider this perspective: since God is infinite and we are finite, if God wanted to make himself known he would have to make his presence clear. So, are there any signs that point to the reality of God? Winfried Corduan put it this way, "...we can look at the world and see if the world is constructed in such a way that it is reasonable to believe that there must be a God." Just as the hunter follows the trail of an animal that he has yet to see -- paw prints, clumps of fur, broken branches -- we are looking for the fingerprint of God in the physical world.    Various signs (lines of reasoning) have been suggested over the last few centuries. Let us briefly consider three. First, the world seems to work according to the universal law of cause and effect. That is, every observable effect must have had an initial "push" by some agent or cause. Every "thing" (a highly scientific term) that we observe is dependent upon other "things" for its existence. For example, children are dependent on parents and the earth is dependent on the sun. Thinking all the way back to the first event, it could be asked, who was the cause? This is where it appears that there must be a being that is "uncaused." Philosophers like to call this a necessary being. Could that be God?    A second sign that should be considered is what scientists today are calling the marks of Intelligent Design. The suggestion is that the universe exhibits purpose, design, and intent. This is not a new idea; William Paley suggested that if you were walking through a field and found a watch on the ground that you would recognize it as a piece of machinery that had purpose and did not simply grow in the forest like plants and trees. A rational conclusion would be that someone intentionally built the watch. The universe is infinitely more complex than a watch and as a result points that much more to an intelligent designer.    A third mark has to do with the moral foundation of the universe. C. S. Lewis referred to this as the "law of human nature." This is not to say that people everywhere are in agreement on all moral values, but that everyone does tend to live by certain common moral principles. For example, people and cultures have different ideas about when it is appropriate to take another person's life, but no one (that would be considered sane) would hold that indiscriminate cold-blooded murder for no reason would be appropriate. It appears that humanity has been intentionally created with an internal moral compass.    All three of these marks appeal to our common sense and fit observations that can be made about the world. Everyone may not be completely convinced by this reasoning, but it seems to make more sense to believe that God is real than that he is not. If that is true, then maybe there are other things that can be known about God. Why don't you try to pick up the trail and see where it leads?                |`|cTYhnumDaa	I have asked myself this question before and I can never come to an answer    like that innocent boy baby p, endured all of his life in pain and had broken ribs and back and such from being abused. That little kid was innocent and he didn't do anything so why did he suffer all his life. Where was god and why did he let that happen?    I think it's always good to have something to believe in but i question my faith when i hear things like that.     Personally I don't think i believe in god simply because I like going by facts, i mean whats more convincing..    the big bang  or  God created the world in seven days    jesus turns water to wine?    he comes back from the dead?    He made a blind man see again although there is still no cure for blindness today  |`|XfaTdCnFaa	Please believe that He is real and read the book of Genesis chapter 1.|`|rovxgyiRaa	There's no proof he is,there's no proof he isn't.I believe in god because of personal experience.|`|UVciAbXxaa	this is what i say about it my 2 sense is that there is something out there but i do not believe that one man created the world an etc.. an there is no proof to prove it. but i do believe there is something out there. an if you think about it when you say is god real what god or you talking about many ppl look to different gods an each religion has its own. not only that look back to Egyptian times or roman times the Romans had 15 gods if im not mistaken so you see every one believes something else so maybe he is maybe hes not idk but i think there is a higher being of power i say that..    srry for the long answer |`|AA10827377	depends on who you are  and what you think   i think he's real  i was brought up thinking   that he's real  so to me..he is |`|tGp2g8hXaa	look around you dummy; all this is not by chance. believe what you want; you will see when you die.|`|d22bddb2f852b0b600baf619cefd2856aa	Yes, He is real. You might want to invest in a Bible and a Bible commentary book.   |`|HNRkgv0Haa	no. duh.|`|tr5He3yEaa	Yes, I think he is real, even though there is no proof and we can't see him or hear him all the time, we walk by faith, not by sight.|`|kbNXSEGgaa	O_O.... ... maybe|`|sYjxG4b2aa	Yah, he is real what do you think?!|`|Wa44n8RCaa	This si a retarted Q because veryone has an opnion... you should have said do you think.... Well i'd say yea... there is proof of people having an out of body experience i.e they die and come back to life aggian but during their death they go to heaven in many cases |`|a5c1c38ad7c6b1059e66d7b2cfdacb98aa	would like to believe there is some1 but god(if there is 1) is not what people say he is. i dun believe in god but maybe some1 watches over us|`|2BpR58GWaa	There are few things which can only be felt not seen.    Have you ever seen hunger or thirst but it is there?  You find ray of hope in tiniest of things?  You feel happy and sad?    Few things are above beliefs and acceptance.    GOD IS THE ONE  |`|bb1ZvkUTaa	Of all the places do you really think this question could possibly answered on an internet message board?    The only possible answer to this question is: there is no proof that god exist, there is also no proof that god doesn't exist.  Religious fanatics will tell you that you must follow faith and that science doesn't matter.  But then they contradict themselves by using science in everyday life like using modern day medicine when they are sick or believing in the laws of gravity.  So to sum it all up, no one knows!  Most likely we will never know.  |`|cW4117fnaa	oh wow. you are gonna get bunches of answers and insults for that question..... but yes i think he is real. if you go to church you should ask somebody about it. wat religion are you?|`|lTKbqOGraa	I have proof...  did you know guys have one less rib than girls do? know why? cuz in the bible it says that guys have one less rib than girls do because God made Eve out of Adam's rib. And plus, he has helped me through EVERYTHING in my life! i could not live without him!! And plus, my mom almost hit a deer once, and she didnt even move the wheel, but our car moved out of the way! God was with us! HE IS DEFINATELY REAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|7X1dPiicaa	Yes God is real.

If I go out with one of my brothers I'm on watch all night|`|rJLeVoMKaa	I find it interesting that you want to stay home and even understand your reasons for it.  I bet it can be weird sometimes being the youngest one.      I think you would be better going with your parents if you are not sure if you have fun or not.  If you think there is a chance, then, go with your sister because she is older and should be more responsible to handle things.  I think your parents trust your judgment and are trying to allow you to use it thus they force you to go out.    I am not a parent, but I believe there are certain decisions you should let your child make within certain parameters.  They have to learn how to make decisions sometime in life, and it is easier to learn when you are younger.|`|7pJ8S0Liaa	If I was you I would more than likely go with my sister.

But their 1st album rocked harder than anything before, and they destroyed the headlining acts they toured with in the early days, so had they disbanded after that they would still have attained cult status and super celebrity.|`|YXRjizKtaa	Probably not because they would seem more legendary and mysterious if they did die at a young age.

a20HarGLaa	Obviously to have or keep a job one hated would mean they weren't going to be productive in it, even for big $$$ they would have a skewed motivation.    Then there is the issue of what $$$ one needs to survive no matter how much they enjoy a job. In that situation they may have to take on another job, which might diminish effectiveness in one or both.    In todays economy I think we should probably accept whatever work we have. It seems likely, here at least, that jobs are vanishing as fast as hope in any rapid improvement over all.    Cheryl    Hey I may still have to go flip burgers. Do you want Fries with your order.

YCAabDonaa	How many explanations would you like? I have found at least five.    The most common one says that in olden times, homes had thatched roofs in which domestic animals such as cats and dogs would like to hide. In heavy rain, the animals would either be washed out of the thatch, or rapidly abandon it for better shelter, so it would seem to be raining cats and dogs. Other suggestions include derivation from an unspecified Greek aphorism that was similar in sound and which meant an unlikely occurrence, or that it is a corrupted version of a rare French word, catadoupe, meaning a waterfall. It has also been suggested that at one time the streets of British towns were so poorly constructed that many cats and dogs would drown whenever there was a storm; people seeing the corpses floating by would think they had fallen from the sky, like the proverbial rains of frogs.|`|74v0PfVbaa	me too, I never understand that, why don't they say its raining elephants and whales instead.|`|cS4zSBGWaa	desn't it rain cats n dogs where u live here it always does that's why there's loads of pet stores here LOL

VbFsdUa8aa	Happy Children's day to you too :)  Well, i have to say that my childhood days were one of the happiest days of my life..so far. I remember going to my grandparent's every year, in the countryside. All of us as a family including the neighbors would get together by the lake and just talk all night long, maybe even have a nice swim in the lake. Then, we'd just lay in the grass and watch the stars..or i'd play hide and seek with my little friends.  It all changes when you grow up :( It's not the same anymore without my grandparent's. (they passed away)|`|PYWsstaqaa	happi childrens day to you too...seems lyk u watch mtv tickr...lolz!|`|34gwDQepaa	Happy Children's Day too !!    happiest memory ... i hav like 2 sisters bt one of them doesnt stay with us . she comes very occasionally ..now she doesnt reside in our city ..so those occasional meets have become even more rare. bt i fondly remember everytime we used to be together..the 3 of us ...since we meet very rarely we didnt fight much (not that much !) ...  best childhood memories involve christmas. it used to be really fun. we used to decorate the tree ... write letter to Santa ..wud recieve gifts !... watch cartoon movies throughout the vacations ...      i really miss it ..now its only me whos celebrating christmas...trying to relive the memory...|`|ZeKnInbjaa	I used to love it when my grandad would reach in his pocket and give us each like a zillion dollars worth of change! that was sooo cool! |`|4472d6c8b8a41746c6129264601312c7aa	You too!

No se se debe hacer llamadas, hay que esconder las fotos y cualquier cosa relaconada con el, que te lo pueda hacer recordar. Hay que empezar desde cero como si el no existiera.

0HTmj0A5aa	Depende de la complenetarcion entre los dos (en realidad queria escoger otra palabra pero no la se escribir correctamente ) .  Para expilcarlo mejor si uno conce a una persona y solo lo saluda formalmente  siempre ,no se crea lo que se necesita para familiarizarse con ella.En cambio en otros casos es muy facil.  |`|PLNu7AHyaa	Con una me basta ..   |`|jtbPeoqDaa	Yo no hablo con las personas y nos las saludo.Ysi saludas y quedas mal parado o cortado prefiero no arriesgarme. |`|cEkjdI7Raa	Pues supongo que una vez; si ya hemos hablado y nos conocemos, claro que la saludo cada vez que me la encuentre.|`|1qevTCr7aa	Una sola..    He hablado con personas en una sola oportunidad y a la segunda vez que la veo la saludo con un beso en la mejilla, todo depende del trato que me haya llevado.    Saludos.|`|b3DUo90jaa	Es un "sentimiento" que para m est en el aire. Hay personas con las que me saludo, nos cruzamos a diario y practica mente ni hemos mantenido conversacin, tan solo el cruzarnos a diario crea una complicidad y unos buenos das o buenas tardes o noches. Si va acompa?ado de una sonrisa el saludo mejor y as suele ser. Eso me gusta, muchas veces te cruzas con personas y te preguntas y a su vez imagino que ellas tambin (como ser su vida y como ser su personalidad). Pero no necesito hablar con esas personas  que forman parte de mi vida cotidiana cuando me dirijo o cuando vuelvo del trabajo, hay un saludo y una sonrisa, sin mas. Que siga as, que muchas veces por un minuto de conversacin se han malogrado posibles amistades. Me quedo con el saludo y la sonrisa, que no falte, el hablar a veces est dems. Pero ya que te refieres al nmero veces y tener que hablar, creo que he dado la vuelta a la tortilla, primero es el saludo y luego nos sentamos y hablamos.

Y1fHrgH1aa	Hola Hispnico:  La ltima que recuerdo es que le dije a un sujeto insufrible, con el que coincido habitualmente ( muy a mi pesar ) ,  que me haba casado. El tipo tiene unos 50 a?os, es calvo, enano, lleva zapatos con tacn y su barriga inconmensurable se expanda, inevitablemente,  sin ningn tipo de complejos, mientras me tiraba los tejos a diestro y siniestro.  Ests caractersticas son irrelevantes si las comparamos con su claro y lcido pensamiento.Para que te hagas una idea del personaje, te voy a relatar dos encuentros con l,  en la mquina de caf.    1) El sujeto se dirige a mi y me dice que le han contagiado un resfriado, a lo que respondo , que es bastante comn en lugares que son frecuentados por mucha gente. El tipo me contesta : " ...No se trata de eso,  es que este fin de semana he tenido intercambio de fludos"... - Puagggg, sin comentarios -    2) Unas semanas despus contrataca, de nuevo y afirma: que trabajadores sos las mujeres....claro como  tenes menos  materia gris que los hombres, os lo tenes que trabajar ms...- Todo un primate pleistocnico. ...-    La tercera vez, tuve la suerte de llevar un anillo, que ni mucho menos es de casada, pero al haberse dado la vuelta, pareca una alianza. El sujeto me pregunta, ? Te has casado?...y yo respondo, sin dubitacin alguna, S...jejejejeje, que observador eres....!! - vi los cielos abiertos -    ? Qu por qu lo hice?.., ya conoces la respuesta.

No, no es verdad nacen ms hombres que mujeres. ?Por que se nivelan?

Lo que hice al terminar bachillerato fue trabajar ya que no tena ni la menor idea de mi verdadera vocacin. Fue a los treinta y uno a?os que descubr lo que me apasiona y esto es la Filosofa, debo confesarte que intente estudiarla en la universidad pero no pude culminar los estudios ya que se me hizo pesado estudiar y trabajar al mismo tiempo. Mi consejo, si es que te sirve de algo es que: determines cual es tu verdadera vocacin para que en el futuro no te arrepientas de la decisin que tomaste.|`|o86P6pLiaa	malo, me embrague, vomite a todos en todos lados. pero lo recuerdo con gracia. |`|u9xTTJUYaa	Demasiadas preguntas y pocas respuestas que darte, no tuve fiesta de graducaicn, no fuimos a ningun lado. Perd dos a?os despus de salir de la prepa jaja, no he visto a mis compa?eros y ni quiero verlos jajaja. Pero te recomiendo que aproveches cada instante de tu vida, relacionate y haz que perduren las relaciones con tus amistades tanto ahora como despus de salir, ya que ellos podrn ayudarte en un futuro cuando lo necesites y siempre es bueno tener verdaderos amigos. Yo no lo hice porque desgraciadamente me toco un mal grupo, pero en fin. Estudia, chale ganas y no te dejes llevar apantallar tanto por las fiestas y el relajo, son buenas para divertirse, pero es aui cuando comienzan ms con el acohol, el cigarro, la droga y bueno las peleas a golpes, asi que cudate, psatela muy bien y disfruta este ciclo sanamente.     Saludos|`|CcRJglOOaa	Bueno, me gradu del colegio hace 4 a?os aprox.

I'm from a small town so I would have to say     Having him pick me up in his beat up old pick up truck, driving around for a while just talking, going to our favorite pizza place for pizza and milkshakes. After that we would drive to the nearby park and just walk under the moonlight, holding hands.    This was me and my boyfriend's first date. It was so magical because there wasn't any pressure for it to be perfect. I liked that it had a few embarrassing moments, awkward silences (well maybe not those so much, but it was a first date and those are to be expected and plus looking back now we both laugh), and even bumping heads on the first attempt at a first kiss    This is my ideal date.|`|dli2L0JYaa	A date where I could go on a picnic-like setting and play chess with my girl, but that's impossible - girls dislike chess.|`|c2Rf4ltxaa	movie, after a nice walk outside at night then just lay on the roof and talk|`|nfEdqqsnaa	hmm :)  i don't know, anywhere as long as it was thoughtful and romantic.  i can tell whether the guy cares about me.  don't take her to mcdonalds, though...i'm warning you.  and don't ask her to pay, either...they try to kiss her.  i dumped that guy so fast his head probably spun|`|mzAE9iesaa	going to the beach at night and snuggling until we fell asleep, in front of a bonfire. |`|lLI5KhZ2aa	my perfect date would be....  -go into an expensive restaurant  -go to the mall  -go to the beach  - a movie  -at the end of the day, a kiss|`|TlqamtJsaa	Meet at quaint restaurant for lunch have a great conversation then kiss  to see if the chemistry is there for both of us then let nature take its   course ,lol      JMM|`|qcuXR1Msaa	One where I could actually get to know the guy  IE, not the cinema.|`|xCicy9LXaa	A walk in the beach, and staying to watch the beautiful sunset.  *-*|`|Thc3f3aDaa	your room.  |`|0zUrSJlRaa	picnic beside a lake.|`|kpkpMCgRaa	Anywhere really.

I like it though.  I think it should be fun.  Not the whole candle lit dinner everyone thinks girls love.  Girly as I am, I'd love to be able to wear jeans on a date, and really just have fun.    Lazer tag and ice cream sounds like a blast, it's fun and you can really get to know each other and laugh together.    Or if he took me to walk a dog from the humane society for charity.  I've always wanted to do that, so I think him showing he's into helping out and likes animals would be great.      Dinner and a movie is too general.  Think fun and different, that's a good date to me.|`|9cZYheP2aa	sunset on the beach!! |`|c46ef35a193ae73fd3fd1140349d463daa	Seeing a great Broadway musical live in New York or going to a live taping of Late Night with Conan O'Brien, then dinner afterwards.

I think dinner and a movie.    you get to know them during dinner  then have fun at the movie  and if i don't like him  i don't have to talk during the movie.    it makes it easier.    that's the best first date.

Plan a dinner date just for the two of you...  Go to a "good will" or consignment shop and you pick out an outfit for her and she picks one out for you...  Set a price at like $15 or whatever you want it to be...  Once the outfits are picked out and paid for, after a few laughs, put the outfit on and go to dinner dressed in what each other picked out for the other person...  Make sure the outfits are appropriate for the restaurant you will be going too...    This will one...break the ice...two you will see what kind of sense of humor she has...and three you will have the best time ever...|`|H9iGzDDZaa	HELP!!!  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...

9gaYCNU9aa	Hola Charlie...no te enfermes amiguito, a ver....aca te doy alguna infomacin que ojala te sirva y as  te sientas mejor.

Desconecta tu Pc de Internet  Luego, procede segn lo siguiente :  - Ejecuta la utilidad de liberacin de espacio en disco.  - Borra los Archivos Temporales de Internet, cookies, e historial.   - Desactiva cualquier programa "sospechoso" de la lista de inicio del msconfig . Se llega a l presionando el botn "Inicio", luego seleccionas ejecutar y all escribes msconfig, aceptas y despus has click en la solapa "Programas del Men Inicio"  - Busca en esa lista, y si encontraste alguno, toma nota del lugar en que se encuentra, y luego de desactivarlo, para lo cual destildas la casilla de verificacin correspondiente, procede a eliminarlo. Si no te permite eliminarlo es porque est en uso. Reinicia la Pc y elimnalo.  - Verifica en el panel de control, agregar o quitar programas, si existe alguno que tu no hayas instalado.

FhQnNwEjaa	Tu piensas que es el juntarse los labios de 2 almas confundidas, pero yo te digo:    - Un beso siempre est contigo y con tu persona preferida,  Solo que hay que liberarlo, para que este no se eche a perder dentro de ti,  es decir un beso est en el aire, solo se necesitan 2 amorosos(macho y hembra), un beso es un reordenamiento de tus sentimientos, es tan solo un momento, pero un momento es mucho cuando de un beso hablamos, besar es compartir la vida.(intercambio de O2)  - Cuando de veras se quiere, se besa sin restricciones, sin duda, sin pena,... -pero, ?si no se quiere?, entonces, ?porqu se besa?.    - No, no, eso no es besar, eso solo es una "coincidencia", es decir es cuando accidentalmente chocan 2 bocas, pero eso no cuenta, repito, es solo una "coincidencia".    - ?Que bonito es el nmero 2! ?verdad?, no obstante el nmero 1 siempre estar antes que el 2 y por siempre ser el mejor, ?y qu es mejor?, ?hablar de 2 personas o de 1 sola pareja? El nmero 1 me gusta ms, es por eso que pienso que cuando hay amor no hay 2 personas, sino una sola pareja, esto es que 2 personas, si se aman, harn una fusin y se convertirn en 1 solo.    ...- Wow, este mundo, que variado es, as como puedes ser t, puedo ser yo o podemos ser t y yo, o an mejor, podemos ser nosotros, nada ms...    Los bohemios saben besar con los ojos  - Retomando lo antes dicho sobre que un beso est en el aire, te digo que se puede besar con los ojos, se puede fsicamente besar con una mirada, pero eso no importa, si no hay amor, es mero accidente, pero si se ama, una mirada puede ser mas que un beso, ahora recuerdo, la mayora de los bohemios besan con los ojos, yo me considero un bohemio neto, es por eso que escribo estas lneas. Es posible que tu las leas porque hay alguien que me inspira suele inspirarme en todos mis poemas (si as quieren llamarlos).    - Yo especialmente beso con los ojos, me encanta besarla con los ojos...    - ?Sabes cuantas cosas puedes decir tan solo con una compleja mirada?; puedes externar lo ms interno, lo ms oscuro, lo ms recndito que hay dentro de ti, es por eso que cuando te ves en el espejo tus sentimientos cambian. ... no finjas, yo se que al verte al espejo cambias de cara, tal vez entristezcas o tal vez sonras, pero cambias, s que cambias.    ?Has besado con notas musicales?  - Tan slo tienen que or las notas juntos, un beso en su forma natural es oxgeno, nitrgeno y algunos contaminantes, pero tiene diversas formas de accionarse a parte de las antes mencionadas.  Un arpa, una harmnica, una guitarra, un acorden, una flauta, un violn, hasta un silbato hecho con un papel entre los dientes, o quizs un silbido. Por cualquiera de estos medios, se puede manifestar un beso, recordando que un beso no es pegar dos labios, sino manifestar un sentimiento, de lo contrario no se le llama beso sino "accidente", "coincidencia"  ("Peque?o captulo dedicado para mi nica musa inspiradora")... No puedo decir su nombre.  "Este Beso es para ti"  No te has dado cuenta aqu en todas estas lneas, nos hemos estado dando un largo beso, porque yo a ti te quiero y se que me quieres, disfrutas este beso, es para nosotros, porque un beso nunca es para una sola persona, sino para una pareja, creo que "pareja", suena mal, ya que la palabra "pareja" nos da una idea de que son dos personas.  ?Como cambiarla? ..que no sea "pareja"... sino otra cosa... ?que ser?...    (Realmente es un ser que est en 2 lugares al mismo tiempo y tiene sus partes las cuales piensan diferente pero van hacia el mismo lugar, esas mismas se complementan, mas concretamente podramos decir que es como un rompecabezas de 2 piezas)  ?Un rompecabezas de 2 piezas?, ?Como llamaras tu a eso?, sin que nos lleve a pensar que es una cosa que se puede dividir?...  No lo se..., pinsalo,... lo nico que se es que:  "La respuesta est en el aire"|`|29e1cb9b1d5729ff833d91ab8e3fe219aa	El beso es la nica carcia que no requiere manos.|`|RK5ebsYdaa	pues un beso es demostrar con una caricia lo mucho que te importa el otro..saludos!|`|5410aca9a556e0216fe24c78895207d4aa	un buen estimulante!!!|`|4EdaGL7Zaa	una atraccin.|`|vukQNlDmaa	Tantas cosas !!!  saludos y exitos!|`|VDFqHz9paa	El contacto intimo entre dos almas...|`|EqlSUR8faa	una demostracion de nuestros deseos, nuestros impulsos y sentimientos.....|`|Arus305eaa	La releche,si est bien dado.|`|9IOOGCrPaa	Lo es todo, una sensacin tan maravillosa que no se puede explicar.|`|y8LcY9lRaa	Cari?o o amor.|`|p8mOkmWTaa	La caricia ms delicada e intensa.

Es el BESO. El beso que va buscando el aliento de la mujer en el hombre, hasta que por fin rozan levemente sus labios, y no terminan de atreverse porque ambos saben que disponen de la Eternidad. Tmidamente ella busca su labio inferior, y la energa fluye entre los dos, y el beso queda sellado, y empiezan a besarse como dos aves en celo que no pueden separse,juntan sus manos, y van juntando sus cuerpos.En un momento abren los ojos y se miran como nunca se haban mirado.Ahora saben que se aman. Y se le presenta una noche majestuosa  Te dejo una estrella,rey  Alfizar|`|ONfsa1xmaa	un beso es, segn Freud, el medio para conseguir la consumacin de un acto sexual, que es el fin.
dQrtLskuaa	Veamos amigo. Lo bello si bien es muy subjetivo tiene condimentos que van ensalsandolo u opacandolo. Sentimientos, circunstancias.

Aunque tuviera el don de la profeca y conociera todos los misterios y toda la ciencia, aunque tuviera toda la fe, una fe capaz de trasladar monta?as, si no tengo amor, no soy nada. Aunque repartiera todos mis bienes para alimentar a los pobres y entregara mi cuerpo a las llamas, si no tengo amor, no me sirve para nada. El amor es paciente, es servicial; el amor no es envidioso, no hace alarde, no se envanece, no procede con bajeza, no busca su propio inters, no se irrita, no tiene en cuenta el mal recibido, no se alegra de la injusticia, sino que se regocija con la verdad. El amor todo lo disculpa, todo lo cree, todo lo espera, todo lo soporta. El amor no pasar jams.   |`|PWG0ACA4aa	Yo amo la vida!!    chao|`|WTol0CPLaa	Yo lo amo todo!!

Ya que sabemos que el corazn es enga?oso (ms que todas las cosas), y perverso, queda claro que no puede ser nuestro escudo contra las adversidades de la vida.    En Efesios nos dice:  Efesios 6:16 Sobre todo, tomad el escudo de la fe, con que podis apagar todos los dardos de fuego del maligno.    Cuando leemos La Palabra de Dios podemos ver que est la respuesta que tanto hemos buscado, Dios nos dio Su Palabra para que todo nos salga bien, como yo le llamo, el libro de instrucciones del ser humano, as yo le llamo a La Palabra de Dios (Biblia).

n2gr1oHHaa	Buenos, fue cuando tenia 17 a?os, mi novio fue a recogerme al cole para invitarme a una pizzeria q quedaba un poco lejos, nos fuimos en el autobus. Yo no le habia dicho nada a mi mami, pero ella me cuenta q se sentia muy angustiada y para el colmo yo me tardaba en llegar. Saliendo de la pizzeria tomamos el autobus de regreso a la casa y se subieron 6 tipos armados q nos amedrentaron con sus clasicas palabras de "esto es un asalto, bajate con todo (entrega todo)". me quitaron la mochila, peroa pesar de los nervios q tenia encima, me ganaron mas los de pensar q me diria mi mama si llegaba a mi casa sin maleta, ja ja, preferi enfrentarme a uno de los ladrones y le pedi mi maleta, gracias a Dios me la devolvieron, se bajaron mas adelante dejando al chofer inconsiente y con el bus a la deriva, uno de los pasajeron logro pasar a la cabina del chofer y piso en freno, hasta entonces te podras imaginas todas las mujeres gritando y ni?os llorando....

9539c40fd1d9e3bd5d2ef5517b43ce02aa	Coincido ampliamente con este concepto...  A mi modo de ver, la sabidura poco o nada tiene que ver con la inteligencia, a pesar de que muchos diccionarios tienen a estas palabras como sinnimos.   Si el hombre fuese ms sabio sabra VIVIR... priorizando lo realmente importante, no buscando aplicar siempre su intelecto para satisfacer su egosmo.   Su ambicin enfermiza, insensible, ilimitada, dirige su "elevada"inteligencia hacia la aniquilacin, lo ves por donde mires...   Si fuera sabio buscara un mundo pacifco, ms justo, con igualdad de oportunidades y de posibilidades en todo sentido, basado en la libertad y el respeto.  Besos, Charlie.|`|1sOkZC2oaa	Aplicara esta frase, slo para los NECIOS!!    El hombre nace o no, con cierta predisposicin para la Inteligencia.  Lo que puede hacer ahora, es estimularla con infinidad de medios y tecnologa que antes no existan.  Tambin es importante, el avance del conocimiento Psicolgico del Ser Humano y lo descubierto sobre Pensamiento Lateral, para hacerlo deducir con mayor perspicacia y amplitud.  La falta de prejuicios y de normas estrictas en lo cultural, tambin relajan el pensamiento y lo desestructuran, logrando mayor capacidad para la libre reflexin y el uso del Raciocinio.    En cuanto a la Sabidura, creo que es ELEMENTAL, llegar a cierta edad biolgica (relativa en cada caso), tener un cmulo importante de experiencias y una clara visin de los acontecimientos a largo plazo, para poder avanzar hacia ella.  Sera algo as, como que un sabio, es un estratega del Pensamiento.  Y resulta indispensable, que haya sido un gran observador social y con conocimiento de la Historia.  Porque todo, se repite circularmente!    Me encant tu pregunta!

9jjB79Nfaa	Hola,    Bueno, las causas son muchas y muy distintas, pero lo ms importante , antes de nombrarlas, es tener claro dos cosas:    1. Ser drogadicto es una ENFERMEDAD,     ( no se trata de "malas personas" ni nada por el estilo)  2. Nos puede pasar a TODOS    "Posibles" motivos:    1. Un hogar desestructurado ( sin amor, cari?o, atencin...)  2. Una infancia infeliz ( malostratos, pobreza,miseria, guerra...)   3. El ms importante: Una personalidad insegura , que se deja llevar fcilmente por los dems y ser dbil en un momento difcil.    No debemos cometer el error de marginarlos y creer que son delincuentes; en el caso de que lo sean, la droga es una CONSECUENCIA de los motivos que le llevan a uno a ser delincuente, que son los algunos de los 3 anteriores.  Primero, uno crece en un entorno desfavorable, luego, no tiene modelos positivos a seguir, despus, lal vida y las dificuldades le llevan a optar por el camino, y una vez all, la droga llega como consecuencia de todo sto.     E caso que tu comentas ; cuando hablamos de los JVENES DE HOY, ms o menos, tambin es por lo siguiente:    1. Ambos padres trabajan y "dicen" no disponer de tiempo para educar y atender a los hijos,  2. El dinero ya no tiene valor, y los mismos padres dan una suma alta a sus hijos los fines de semana, para que se diviertan,  3. stos padres "tan ocupados" no ejercen ningn tipo de control sobre sus hijos; no conocen sus amistades, ni sus gustos, ni sus tendencias ni vicios....  4. El resultado de todo sto es : unos hijos abandonados, mimados, acostumbrados a estar slos, y lo que es peor; con dinero, mucho dinero.  5. Los hijos desconocen los valores morales y educativos, que han sido substitudos por la canguro "t.v" y "playstation".  6. Los hijos desconocen el concepto del esfuerzo y la responsabilidad, ambos no le son exigidos.    7. stos hijos no se interesan por nada, lo quieren todo rpido y fcil, no tienen criterio ni ideologas, responsabilidad ni deberes. Slo cuenta la vida fcil y la diversin.    ( espero que reflexionemos PADRES E HIJOS sobre sta juventud, y el futuro que les espera)    P.D: No tiene nada que ver con la REBELDA : la rebelda es algo natural en la adolescencia, y con la madurez desaparece. Las tribus urbanas, por ejemplo, son rebeldes , pero siguen una ideologa y algo en lo que creen; son rebeldes expresando su inconformidad social a travs de su imagen, ropa y msica.  Ejemplo actual de ello:   Alaska: es punk, trangresora , vanguardista y rebelde.  Pero gracias a su esfuerzo y trabajo duro, hoy sigue siendo un mito y se mantiene en la msica despus de ms de 20 a?os.  La rebelda es incluso buena, cuando detrs tiene un por qu, cultura, sabidura y una actitud correcta.    salud,    salud,|`|f3AeCT4Taa	los malos amigos|`|j7pcYXGMaa	1-Malas juntas  2-Padres con mucha falta de comunicacion.  3-Mala infancia  4-Ver cosas que no se debe.

Y llegar a ser personas exitosas|`|8acL9Vdbaa	Lo que siempre he dicho y he pensado: Por que no se sienten acogidos en su propio hogar, porque se sienten rechazados y solos, porque no encuentran esa simpata o qumica con sus propios padres.  La raz de este impulso viene slo de casa...por eso es que uno como padre debe estar en todo con sus hijos y brindarles toda la confianza posible y que ellos se den cuenta que verdaderamente por cualquier error  que sea cuanta con nuestro apoyo para salir adelante y no lo contrario...hundirlos y juzgarlos.|`|jPIBsXJHaa	las malas juntas, algo de depresion y la falta de cari?o.|`|yFPvV8CPaa	Yo creo que baja autoestima, inseguridad, incomprensin, falta de motivacin, falta de sentir afecto, autodestruccin, etc...|`|O5Z8AsWnaa	Sentirce superior y creerce capaz de manejar todo y a todos, y tambin un poco de deshubicacin|`|63mr8yrVaa	hola!!!!!    es solo por que son debiles y no saben decir que no !!!    la mayoria de ellos lo hacen por que tienen problemas !!      pero eso no es una justificacion!!!        saludos !!!          xauzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz|`|dm7NSMLUaa	se sienten deprimidos, tienen algun problema y se refugian en las drogas porque piensan que los hara olvidarse de sus rollos por unos instantes, pero seguro luego se sienten peor que antes de drogarse. tambien puede ser alguna mala junta, o porque creen que drogarse esta de moda, para no parecer tontos ante sus amigos que se drogan... pueden haber millones de razones|`|wM1SyDbLaa	Las influencias de sus amigos, la musica, el lugar donde viven, su infancia, la depresion, por entrar a un grupo de amigos, su tipo de vida, familiares y en dados casos la television, la falta de empleos, mala educacion, EL GOBIERNO|`|6CC7s7w3aa	curiosidad, soledad, desprecio y pobreza.|`|91T9mvGlaa	Sus problemas principalmente,Sus amitades o querer estar a la moda y algo tambien influye su entorno.|`|V0xDLQ2Haa	Sera q no stan bien educados, o se dejan llvar x amigos q lo hacen y como no tienen personalidad suficiente,,, yo tngo 15 a?os y conozco gente de mi edad q se droga, fuma, bebe, y yo les pregunto xQ y me dicen q asi estan 'agusto' en las fiestas y q no es lo mismo estar un pokito 'piin' q no se emborrachan ni se drogan completamente, xq ''lo controlan'' pero yo sigo sin entenderlos y ellos m dicen q drogas como los cogollos, pericos, porros y eso no hace da?o =S.. pero en fiiin la verdad no se q dcirte con exactitud!!

Y eso es lo que pasa en muchos casos, ya cuando uno se siente solo`pues hay amigos que estan muy cerca y estan metidos en el mismo problema y ahi van los dems, hasta que se les pega eso.    Yo creo bueno, que es as, y no simplemente por querer explorar o algo as, y  adems tambin pasa porque no estan bien preparados en sentido educacional, o sea los papas no les platican sobre esas cosas con tiempo, por  eso es bueno la planificacin familiar y no de no mas meterse a cosas y despus ya ni quieren reconocer sus responsabilidades.    Espero sea buena respuesta. adios|`|qiBCaN3caa	1)Las malas compa?ias (influencias)  2)Desinformacion.  3)Baja auto estima.  4)Poca o nula comunicacin con los padres o tutores.  5)Haber vivido situaciones traumantes durante la infancia.  6)Poco apoyo por parte de la familia.  7)Desintegracin familiar.  8)Querer ser aceptados por un grupo social.  Finalmente todo esto se engloba en el punto numero 4. Si quieres empezar a hablarle a un ni?o acerca de sexo y drogas a los 11 a?os ya es demasiado tarde.  Hay que inculcarles valores desde recin nacidos.  Hay que interesarnos en lo que tienen que decir y no subes timar sus problemas en comparacion con los nuestros ya en la vida adulta.  La drogadiccin es la plaga que infecta nuestra sociedad y que termina con las vidas de miles de jvenes alrededor del mundo.  Si vives cerca o con un adolescente, platica con el/ella, tal vez tu puedas cambiar el destino de un joven.

La vida no es cualquier cosa ni mucho menos un juego, es algo muy preciado y ms valioso de todas las cosas que hay en el mundo. Se debe luchar con muchsimo empe?o para alcanzar lo que ms se anhela y desea como la felicidad, por ejemplo. No es nada fcil, pero valdr la pena si damos todo lo que nosotros tenemos. La vida nos da golpes, eso debe pasar, ?porqu? para que nosotros aprendamos ciertas lecciones que se nos quieren ense?ar para cambiar nuestra actitud, mejorar nuestra forma de ser y en cierta forma nuestra mentalidad, la cual debe no slo estar lleno de racionalismo y empirismo, sino tambin de positivismo, y de buenas energas o vibras, para seguir con ganas de hacer todo por nuestra cuenta y lo que queremos con nuestra voluntad, estos golpes nos hace dar cuenta de que estamos cometiendo errores, que nos falta muchas cosas para forjar y construir nuestro perfil como seres humanos y racionales, y tambin para hacernos vislumbrar que tambin tenemos nuestro lado negativo y que no todo en la vida no es color de rosa ni de fantasas como al principio de nuestra existencia creamos con todo nuestro ser, que tambin hay obstculos y pruebas, ah es donde uno comienza a saber que es la vida realmente, sobretodo para aquellas personas que todo el tiempo era cosas buenas y nada le sala mal, pero los golpes les debe dar ese bajn para que se den cuenta de muchas cosas y aprenda a apreciar y a descifrar el significado de la vida. Eso me pas a m desde hace mucho tiempo como 3 a?os desde los 13 hasta los 16 a?os, la cual es la edad que tengo ahora. Tambin te da alegras, y eso es un problema para los que a todo el tiempo le va bien, porque se olvidan de lo difcil que es la vida y se duermen en los laureles, y despus reaccionan cuando empiezan a cambiar las cosas para mal, eso deber suceder. No quiero decir que las alegras son algo malo, no, en absoluto, ms bien, digo su contraparte, y las alegras hay que disfrutarlas, pues constituyen nuestros mejores momentos y son las circunstancias ms agradables y sensacionales de la vida, en donde hay que despejar la mente, olvidarse de los problemas por un tiempo y pasarla bien con los amigos, con la familia, vivir los momentos ms clidos, y eso es lo mejor de la vida, cuando se esfuerza hay recompensa y xito, y por ende alegras, cuando se realiza algo bien hecho o se supera, es un paso adelante en la vida y eso es motivo de alegra, o en la vida cotidiana, cuando uno realiza las cosas bien hechas es motivo de satisfaccin, haces lo que ms te mueve, te apasiona y te gusta, eso es alegra, porque se hace con mente positiva y entusiasmo. La vida hay que tomarlo de las dos formas, sus partes mximas y sus altibajos. Hay que vivir y disfrutar la vida, esforzndose de cada da sea mejor.|`|9539c40fd1d9e3bd5d2ef5517b43ce02aa	La vida es como tu mam... te di algunos chirlos y muchas, muchsimas alegras... te ense? y te prepar para tu crecimiento y tu autosuperacin...

Cuando alguien te diga ,"Te quiero", no es amor, es posecin, quiere todo y no da nada... El que expresa, "Te amo", es el que te da todo a cambio de nada, las dos cosas se parecen,  pero se oponen, una pide, otra da.  Y el amor es dar, y el milagro, es que siempre regresa, amas, das,  todo de ti, y quizs pretendes que quien recibe, devuelva igual o ms, tremenda equivocacin, no siempre viene de quien recibi, puede venir de otros miles, a quienes no miras,  porque te encierras en alguien que no es tu destino, pero no dudes que tu vida siempre tendr amor, buscalo, no te niegues a las posibilidades, abre tus ojos y a tu  alrededor, siempre encontrars mucho amor, y si uno se va, muy pronto otro lo reemplazar, es una ley no escrita de la a misma, si hay  via hay esperanza, y es toda tuya.

A mayor celos, el amor es mas condicional.  A menor celos, el amor es mas incondicional.    Una persona muy celosa con su amante, es aquella que para brindarse en "amor", lo hace con un sin numero de requerimientos y condiciones personales que el amante tiene que aceptar o de lo contrario, la relacin se viene abajo . Un persona celosa no tiene el entendimiento de que no hay nadie que haya venido a este mundo, para satisfacerla en los momentos precisos que ella quiera, donde ella quiera y como ella quiera, es decir al gusto y al antojo de la persona celosa. En ese sentido la persona celosa no sabe admirar y  respetar la individualidad de su amante. La persona celosa se maneja mas con la lgica y la razn que el corazn.     Y manejarse con lgica y con la razn es sano en asuntos de trabajo, investigacin cientfica, negocios, etc. pero no para los asuntos del corazn. Para amar hay que ir mas all de la lgica y la razn.    En una pareja, los celos fomentan no una relacin de amor sino una relacin de dominio y sumisin la cual crea derechos y deberes : uno ya no se brinda con amor sino que se calculan y se premeditan los actos con astucia. La relacin se vuelve un calvario.    A mi parecer, la persona celosa no esta segura del amor que siente por su pareja: esta mas cogida por deseo sexual . No esta segura de lo que ella da. Del valor que esta dando al brindarse a su pareja. De lo que ella verdaderamente vale. Por eso se inquieta, no se siente segura : puede que otra persona se lo lleve a su amante.    Si en en el amor, existe celos, es muy miserable que en la amistad exista. Habra por lo menos liberar a la amistad de los celos. La verdadera amistad es verdaderamente incondicional. Y si el concepto de la amistad se llevara al amor, el amor se elevaria. El amor estaria mas cerca del jubilo, del regocijo y el deleite.    Un abrazo|`|ohZbbBwUaa	HoOola!!!

Yo se que hay veces que uno se pone enojado o depresivo en la semana por ocurrencias que pasan al transcurso de ella, pero no importa lo que suceda, uno siempre tiene el derecho de elegir como nos sentimos y pensamos. Eso no nos lo puede quitar nadie.  En el trabajo siempre todos me dicen que cada vez que me ven siempre tengo una sonrisa en la cara que como le hago para estar siempre contenta.  Y yo les respondo que con el solo saber que tengo la oportunidad de escoger como me sienta es mas que suficiente.  Es muy simple, escojo sentirme contenta en vez de triste.  |`|uPGiWACPaa	Pues, trabajando y pidiendo a dios que sea una semana productiva...  con muchos logros              besitos|`|76J2wpmJaa	saludos! yo te diria ke la mejor forma de comenzar cualkier dia de la semana es, tempranito cuando te despiertes en tu primer respirar dar gracias por el dia ke se te fue dado, medita unos minutos acostado, sobre ke esperas de ese dia o semana, piensa en cosas positivas y  asi las atraeras.... yo te deseo ke tengas una semana llena de exitos ...|`|jiZ6hTieaa	lloviendo a la madrugada como hoyyyyyyy...ahyy. ?despertome!|`|PlM3YXGOaa	Generalmente x los lunes...... con humor !|`|9dAhUI5taa	dandole los buenos dias al sol, al mundo y por supuesto a tu vecina!

aac9a158cafd28a3b47d0ca5446403caaa	Tiene que ver con la dispersin de la luz por la atmsfera terrestre. La luz del Sol es una onda electromagntica compuesta por una infinidad de ondas de diferentes longitudes de onda. A cada longitud de onda le corresponde un color diferente; sta es la razn por lo que en ocasiones aparece en el cielo el arcoiris.     Ahora, bien, al entrar en la atmsfera terrestre, la luz solar es reflejada por las partculas de polvo y de agua presentes en la atmsfera, y dispersada por las molculas que la componen. Pero las molculas son ms eficaces para dispersar las longitudes de onda correspondientes al azul. Por eso el cielo se ve azul, pues hacia donde quiera que miremos, veremos ms luz azul dispersa, y el Sol se ve amarillo. En el espacio, donde no hay atmsfera, el cielo se ve negro (no hay dispersin de la luz) y el Sol se ve blanco.     Al ocaso, la luz del Sol tiene que atravesar una capa de atmsfera ms gruesa para llegar a nosotros por lo que el Sol se va tornando naranja y luego rojo. Esto se debe a que la luz azul se dispersa cada vez ms y slo nos llega luz roja.    Si en el cielo hay muchas partculas de polvo o de agua, la luz blanca se refleja en ellas, y la luz azul se dispersa cada vez ms en las molculas, por lo que el cielo comienza a te?irse de tonos rosados, malvas y lilas, ofrecindonos un bello espectculo.|`|jiZ6hTieaa	el color rozizo de las tardes  involucra la lontalanza  si mirs de reojo  vers caminar los piojos  con la panza llena...  huy!! me pongo rmntica...  tiene que ver con..la distancia del rayo que atraviesa la finitud de las nubascas en retorno hacia nuestro ojo. al piojo!|`|rUHuA1csaa	pss x el sol se va a esconder y se esparce po todo el cielo y va kmbaidno de color asta poner oscuro y eh ahi kuando la noche llega  jajaja xD saludoz!!|`|2feff956ff4f22635614319fd78205e4aa	Es una pregunta muy interesante.

0ef08b722f091b817db6fab3e03239e2aa	Hola,    Mira la verdad yo me preguntaba, qu es HSM y no me haba dado cuenta que TV Azteca le dio al clavo... es lo que est de moda entre los adolescentes, ser que yo ya tengo 28 jajajajajaja que no me daba cuenta, creo que Azteca junto con Dinsney y el patrocinio de Telcel harn una buena mancuerna y tienen al mejor pblico, el que compra, el que sigue, el de los fans y esas cosas que es el pblico adolescente, respecto a Timbiriche, pues no hay nada innovador, las segundas partes nunca son buenas, ya vimos a menudo etc etc etc     Esta vez mi voto lo tiene el musical de la pelcula de Disney    P.D. El cierre del programa cuando cantaron la cancin de la pelcula fue espectcular, ya hasta me aprend el nombre de un concursante que seguro ser finalista, baila muy padre se llama Tony Garza, que chico tan simptico jajajajaja parezco adolescente!    saludos|`|2wDJmluOaa	Yo no vi ninguno de los dos, la verdad con la academia y big brother ya tuve suficiente. Creo que las propuestas actuales de television (abierta principalmente) son muy pobres, asi que no habiendo mas que ver pues supongo habra gente que si los sigua cada semana. Personalmente me llama un poco mas la atencion lo de Timbiriche por lo menos para escuchar canciones que para mi son significativas (aunque por lo que dices no seran muy buenas versiones)|`|2ae59432e3114970bc9c498a76468414aa	pues tienes razon, ninguno de los dos mostro un buen arranque pero creo que como en anteriores ocasiones TvAzteca se llevara el rating xq si ha sabido vender sus realitys con mucha astucia mientras que Televisa satura y satura sus programas con cambios de reglas de juego, nuevos integrantes, escenarios llenos de luces y artefactos que hacen perder la atencion y con un sonido pesimo en sus programas musicales que es en los que deberian tener mas cuidado pues es lo que se esta calificando o criticando, como en timbiriche que solo se escuchaban ruidos espantosos de musica que se veian salpicados de desentonados gritos de todos los chavos que entraron... ademas curiosamente en timbiriche tmb hay gente que se parece a los integrantes de timbiriche y que gracias al manejo de las camaras el mismo programa te va ubicando quien con quien..... yo le voy a high school musical xq  es el boom ahorita entre los morrillos no solo de mexico sino de toda latinoamerica... aunque habra que ver que tipo de pruebas tendra cada programa y como manejaran los programas en la semana|`|yAMs9Cikaa	pues yo vi un poco de ambos,,  pero la verdad no les  veo ningun futuro a  los dos,,,las ni?as y ni?os,, pues  ni cantan ni bailan,,   nomas  por  que estan bonitos,,por eso estan ahi,,,|`|UZNksQKraa	Yo vi principalmente HSM y en los comerciales vea Timbiriche. Me dio mucha tristesa ver que se esmeraron mas en otros castings que al que yo fui, por que yo fui al casting del domingo del Distrito Federal de HSM. Tienes razn en lo de que no se vio casi nada del talento de los chavos y yo me esperaba algo mejor eh !! Al casting que yo fui haba chavos mas guapos y mejores bailarines de los seleccionados. Los Timbiriches estaban para llorar jajaja algunos y otros si estaban guapetones, pero sin mucha gracia. Sigo prefiriendo HSM porque sal mi novio Roger !!! jeje|`|6f8a1b4d370dd0eb64a47d2236c61f20aa	simplemente, ninguno vale la pena|`|lzl4Hdm9aa	A mi la verdad me gust mas HSM y sobre todo Roger el conductor se me hace genial, muy naturalito, sin poses, Mara Ins se me hizo muy X, espero que ya el proximo programa se pueda apreciar que tanto talento traen los concursantes, en cambio timbriche mmmm ese Marco Flavio me fastidi demasiado, por que quiere llamar tanto la atencin??? todo se me hace exagerado, no me agrad|`|d43e0bf59812581e58e452ccd4ea59d2aa	Francamente ninguno de los dos llama mi atencin.     Pareciera que TV Azteca quiere obtener mucho rating al mnimo costo. Es decir, siempre con los mismos escenarios, con las mismas dinmicas, con la misma marrana pero ms que revolcada. ?Por qu diablos no fomentan un verdadero musical que tanto hacen falta en este pas, cuando ya se vio que Hoy no me puedo levantar, Cabaret, Victor Victoria, etc., son propuestas que realmente quieren impulsar ese tipo de teatro en Mxico (independientemente si nos gustan o no)?    Por otro lado Televisa: Hay por Dios!!! Yo no pertenec a la generacin Timbiriche. Me gustan algunas canciones por supuesto. Sin embargo, creo que de ah sali gente con muy poco talento quien est hacindola bastante, pero que no pasan de ser productos comerciales visuales: Thala, Paulina, etc. Otros, con ms talento, no tienen un apoyo tan marcado: Beny, Sasha Sokol, Mariana Garza, y bla bla bla.     Para m hay cosas irrepetibles, y Timbiriche es una de ellas.     En fin, que esos programas los vea la gente a quien le gustan. Estn en todo su derecho y eso es respetable.     Desde mi punto de vista no es la televisin que yo quiero ver y no pienso idiotizarme la mente con algo tan pobre. De igual manera, no quisiera quedar ms tonto y ciego con football hasta por donde no o cosas similares.     Es todo.

qQ4AnZpQaa	First all of the hotties with the big asses, then all of the other women that are easy and sleazy, then with the few spots left, he lets in a few pious people|`|7vl8mEFPaa	As stated in the bible and various books I have read. You will meet him face to face with his angels among with other people behind you who are about to be judged. If you did not believe in him on earth then he will immidtiatly tell you "Depart from me you who are cursed, I never knew you". If you did believe in him he will have books on your life which will be set on fire in a flash, left behind will be ash and what ever you earnt for yourself in heaven from doing good things on the old earth. This could be from nothing, to scarps of jewels and to the best a crown which you will wear in heaven to show your life.     This is it written out very quickly and vague. But you will stand to him one day and have to look him in the eye whilst you are judged. I say, give up your life on earth to serve him and live an eternal life in heaven. Or sin on earth and do not believe and prepare for eternal torment.    All written in the bible. :)|`|XswhBhqlaa	Read Revelations.  Even if you are just joking about it and don't care, you should read it.  It is very interesting.  |`|j8sgjeX7aa	God doesn't, you do. God gives you free will and an enviroment to test that free will. God gives you the guidelines and the expectations of every person. If you feel, in your heart, that you have lived a good life and done what was expected of you, then you will find yourself in paradise when you pass. If YOU KNOW you weren't the person you should have been, you will suffer for your actions in the afterlife.    Look, heaven and hell aren't split down the middle. Ghandi and Mother Theresa aren't waiting for you in heaven, Hitler and Ghengis Khan aren't waiting to torture you in hell. There isn't some good/bad line you cross over. Life is what you make it. So is death. |`|3dI4QudPaa	if you played up on your partner, youre not going..  if you gave money to charity youre going  if you played up and gave to charity its a good ol' flip of the coin...|`|ld15K9kEaa	It depends on which "god" you are talking about. They all have different reasons to allow or disallow people into "heaven". Personally, I don't believe in a god and this is one of many reasons why. I guess you'll just have to read whichever set of rules this god has written and then follow them if you want to get in. Good luck! |`|xiAWbAKCaa	well it is depends on your good doings in this world  believing in god and not worshiping any one else except him  being a person who is always a good cause for his family and society  following your holy book depending on your religion and faith  staying away from sinful things   and alot more and you will discover it if you look around you in the World and say "how is the skies hunged without pillars"  who controls this universe just believe in the all mighty|`|AA11114071	Only he can answer that specifically but the rules are in the bible. BTW you don't go to heaven, good people will be in paradise if they abide by his rules Psalms 37:9-11. He will cut evildoers from the earth and the righteous people will inherit the EARTH. It doesn't say they'll go to heaven. The prospect of going to heaven are for the utmost faithfull, not just for anyone. |`|MOu24TIbaa	accept jesus christ as your lord and savior, repent for your sins and sincerly in your heart keep and obey his comandments.  remember god judges the heart not the deeds of man.  Forgiveness is key,so is love.red your bible and get to know him.  Anything else he's not interested.Anything else will land you in eternal hell fire.are you willing to gamble? I'M NOT!!!!!|`|ecd6e128f5da699009e67e0f4b41a6b8aa	All you have to do is to accept Him and confess Him as your personal Lord and Savior. If you confess with your mouth, Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved (Romans 10:9-10).

But if you want my Option he Judges use on how much has ben reviled to us and the chances he gives use to Know him.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Good question and I don't know the answer. But I am bringing some extra cash with me when I croak. You never know. God just might be in the mood to accept a bribe, lol.|`|s6emVQleaa	It depends on what you believe.  I'm a Christian and I believe that anyone who believes in God and asks for his forgiveness will go to heaven- it's that simple.  |`|mLccTAhLaa	I`m led to believe he holds a raffle|`|YfCRmWeSaa	He looks to see who wasted their life the most by praying to him and spending thousands of dollars for churches who "need" their money.|`|Qih2hKqkaa	Well, he has this great instruction manuel called the Bible.  You might what to give it a read.|`|73dEt59yaa	well I believe you die and that's it, your just dead. so In my belief he doesn't as there is no heaven....|`|KHWMFVsDaa	because he can see into out souls to see if we have lived good lives x|`|8097d1402d50718b097c035b239a2711aa	No such thing as God|`|pg1wqQNwaa	he flips a coin|`|AA10091004	YOU decide you own fate, by the way you live your life. If you live a life full of hatred and sin, then you may not get to heaven. If you live a good, decent life, your chances are better at getting to heaven. God can see your character and soul through your eyes. The eyes are the window to your soul.|`|dfa0f10d091f9f82c584408f50df66a8aa	He gave us the free will to decide. Unlike the angels humans were created with the ability to make choices not just obey commands.    Now we have the choice to obey commands as well as believe in Christ and the gospel message of Truth. If we don't we so condemn ourselves and separate ourselves from God in Heaven.    God being omniscient knows how we will choose but He doesn't force us to choose.|`|36PrVK7Oaa	You decide.|`|twvFi8emaa	Nobody knows the answer to that.  The self-rightious people who think that they are bible scholars will assume that they know how God thinks, and I'm sure that they will have an answer for you.|`|kfySwy8baa	he picks your name out of a hat|`|Z6csNQFQaa	he makes a list and checks it twice.|`|nwhoL46Laa	whoever believes in him and follows him|`|1PSolGHmaa	he doesn't.|`|UzXCdkMpaa	I didn't get the memo.|`|KXs6Y0APaa	From the sins you have done.|`|vz7XaCmFaa	he made it clear that those who live by him world and follow them alway those are the one who will go|`|bnpJQGt3aa	He doesn't decide. We decide if we go or not.|`|BnjFbaygaa	how santa decides who gets toys this christmas and who doesn't     lol    well live your life on a straight path doing good things, you enter heaven    live a foolish life doing bad things, you enter hell     =] |`|jkkatZfBaa	You do that all by yourself.|`|UrAb8dNRaa	That's a bit like asking how does Santa decide who's been good.|`|sqJYOuJQaa	He has a CCTV camera that records who does good and who does bad and then he rechecks it from time to time before making a decision.|`|AA11081404	He doesn't! It's the individual who chooses for himself or herself, by the kind of life they live before they die.|`|JJHjARCBaa	I will let u know when I get there.|`|45ab0bea68cbc724ceec9b426a6147b3aa	By Whomever read the instructions and followed them.

It's not about works or how "good" of a person you've been.  It's about choosing Him.|`|MG0vew3taa	I fell he goes by whats in your heart|`|CF9HTwxeaa	if your a guy....if you've never spanked the monkey.  if your a gal.....waited till you were married to spank the monkey.  |`|YYJ2SlKbaa	When you die you must fight a hippo named Steve with only a cactus and a croquet mallet.

I don't really believe in that, but I think this is what happens:    1. You do only good things.  2. He puts you on a good person list.  (Step 3 and 4 is for sinners)  3. You do only bad things.  4. He puts you on a bad person list.  5. You die.  6. On which list you are on, you go there.  (Bad -- Hell)(Good -- Heaven)    :)    Hope you go to Heaven!! :))|`|aB8KdIg6aa	he decide who go to heaven by if you are a good person, if you believe in him and if you do very little sin but ask for forgiveness and don't try to attempt it any more.|`|hERbVwdNaa	In Islam, it says that heaven lies under your mother's feet.

Fumando espero   al hombre a quien yo quiero,   tras los cristales   de alegres ventanales.   Mientras fumo,   mi vida no consumo   porque flotando el humo   me suelo adormecer...   Tendida en la chaisse longue   so?ar y amar...   Ver a mi amante   solcito y galante,   sentir sus labios   besar con besos sabios,   y el devaneo   sentir con ms deseos   cuando sus ojos veo,   sedientos de pasin.   Por eso estando mi bien   es mi fumar un edn.     Dame el humo de tu boca.   Anda, que as me vuelvo loca.   Corre que quiero enloquecer   de placer,   sintiendo ese calor   del humo embriagador   que acaba por prender   la llama ardiente del amor.     Mi egipcio es especial,   qu olor, se?or.   Tras la batalla   en que el amor estalla,   un cigarrillo   es siempre un descansillo   y aunque parece   que el cuerpo languidece,   tras el cigarro crece   su fuerza, su vigor.   La hora de inquietud   con l, no es cruel,   sus espirales son sue?os celestiales,   y forman nubes   que as a la gloria suben   y envuelta en ella,   su chispa es una estrella   que luce, clara y bella   con rpido fulgor.

JPusgNPRaa	La verdad es que no lo s te dejo esta informacin:  La Gelatina es una sustancia slida, incolora, translcida, quebradiza y casi inspida que se obtiene a partir del colgeno procedente del tejido conectivo de despojos animales hervidos con agua.    En el animal, la gelatina no existe como componente, se la obtiene, como ya se dijo, por hidrlisis parcial irreversible del colgeno, su precursor insoluble. En el colgeno, la unidad bsica est formada por tres cadenas de polipptidos, enrolladas en forma de hlice y estabilizadas por uniones intramoleculares. Esto hace que el colgeno exhiba propiedades mecnicas nicas y forme la estructura del tejido conectivo de la piel, los tendones, los cartlagos y los huesos de los animales.    La gelatina es una protena compleja, es decir, un polmero compuesto por aminocidos. Esta protena carece de los principales aminocidos esenciales para la nutricin humana como valina, tirosina y triptfano, y por lo tanto no tiene valor como alimento. Como sucede con los polisacridos, el grado de polimerizacin, la naturaleza de los monmeros y la secuencia en la cadena proteica determinan sus propiedades generales. Una notable propiedad de esta molcula es su comportamiento frente a temperaturas diferentes: se derrite con el agua caliente y se solidifica nuevamente y se hincha con el agua fra.    Por ser de procedencia animal los practicantes del vegetarianismo se abstienen de consumirla en cualquiera de sus formas.|`|qRcENSqHaa	La respuesta de dolly apesta!... no, no se quien la invento, pero dicen que sale de los pies de las vacas.|`|yoa81f4Qaa	la inventod el Dr. Maddox pero fue mejorada y llevada al mercado por John Burguess en 1873|`|iRkM3fKyaa	a inventod el Dr. Maddox|`|594ca6b833b7d473290b5eeed5d6e5e6aa	El descubrimiento de la gelatina es atribuido a Peter Cooper, ingeniero autodidacta, fundador de la primera institucin de altos estudios de los Estados Unidos, la Cooper Union, en 1848  Alfred Nobel invent la gelatina explosiva  En Fotografa , el inventor de las "placas secas o de gelatino-bromuro" fue Richard Leach Maddox  http://vhost-003117.vhost.cantv.net/info...

Les abeilles elles sont  l depuis 25 gnrations et elles n'ont jamais piqu personne.    - Ca, c'est vous qui le dites !    - Bon, dit le fermier, on va faire un march : je t'attache  poil   l'arbre prs des ruches pendant une heure et si une seule abeille te  pique,je te donne ma ferme pour rien.    Le bruxellois rflchit et se dit que finalement pour 8 millions ?a vaut  la peine d'essayer.    Le fermier le fout  poil et l'attache  l'arbre.    Une fois le fermier parti, le bruxellois s'agite un peu afin d'attirer  les abeilles.    Une heure plus tard, le fermier revient et trouve le type compltement  affal, vid au pied de l'arbre :    - Que s'est-il pass ? demande le fermier, elles vous ont attaqu ? Ce  n'est pas possible,elles n'ont jamais fait ?a avant !    - Le bruxellois lui rpond : Non, non, mais le veau ?a fait combien  temps qu'il a perdu sa mre ?|`|h9qzHzPMaa	Cela me fait penser au pharmacien et son chient!

41fca3ef26f94d9028de0111ec2c9ca8aa	Michael??? No para nada, ellos solo se vieron una vez, el la salv de la torre, bailaron, pero fue la medicina lo nico que tenan en comn.  Anthony, fue su primer amor, un hermoso primer amor que le deja recuerdos que atesorar toda su vida y que la llev a conocer el dolor, sin embargo ese dolor no se lo provoc l, si no su trgica muerte. Siempre he dicho que el amor de su vida es y ser Terry, ella sigui pensando en Terry hasta los ltimos captulos; incluso pierde la cabeza y acepta verlo en una mansin a solas, sin importarle Susana, a pocos captulos del final.  Y aunque a todos nos gusta ver a Candy tan feliz a lado de Albert, ver como la consuela despus de que termina con Terry, como se abraza a l ese mismo da despus de que el fuera arrollado por un auto, y nos da alivio descubrir que Albert es el poderoso Abuelo Williams; nunca sentir por Albert lo que sinti por Terry, cuando corra al puerto de South Hampton y vea como se alejaba en el barco, cuando se quedaron inmviles sin poder tocarse ante el tan deseado reencuentro enla estacin del tren; ese si fu un gran amor, con una qumica tremenda y el ingrediente que lo hace ser mas anhelado: el ser un amor imposible. En el fanfic reencuentro en el vrtice, (adoptado como el final oficial en el Candymundo) Candy y Terry quedan juntos, peleandose y amndose como siempre, en ste fic puede aprecierse la misma pasin que siempre hubo entre ellos.|`|wyPSRD5Daa	ANTHONY,ANTHONY,ANTHONY,ANTHONY   .......

Creo que tu pregunta no se refiere a que te gusta ser extrovertido o comunicativo, sino que hay cosas que se te salen sin querer y eso te causa muchos problemas... la gente va a empezar a ya no decirte las cosas  o decirte a propsito lo que quieren que se enteren los dems. Eres seguramente muy dinmico y siempre tienes temas de conversacin, sientes que la gente te busca por eso. antes de decir nada, piensa si esa persona se acerc a ti para sacarte informacin o "mete hilo para sacar madeja", s ms pausado al momento de responder y eso te permitir hacer tiempo para pensar qu debes decir y qu no.

7Z3QvJmGaa	Amigo... Siempre te vas a topar con gente as en cualquier lado as que no te preocupes... sigueles la corriente pues talvez ellos lo nico que buscan es probar cuanta pasiencia tienes y de que manera manejas situaciones desesperantes como esa. Las empresas a veces te buscan dificultades para probar que tan bueno eres para solucionar problemas de toda ndole y as es como valoran a sus empleados para darles mejores oportunidades. Si t te lo tomas a mal y crees que una frenta en tu contra tienes todas las de perder. Si despus de todo quieres dejar ese trabajo adelante, hazlo, pero te advierto, en cualquier otro que encuentres en el futuro te topars con los mismos problemas pues buscan a gente audz y que sepa manejar o sortear conflictos laborales (aunque es cierto que nunca falta quien simplemente lo haga por fastidiarte) pero eso pasa en todos lados, no eres el nico.

The normal arguments against it are that it seems bizarre to change something which works just fine, it's a big part of national identity and we are already struggling with that because we are very Americanised (not that I think that's necessarily a bad thing).  We actually like our money, it's old fashioned looking and I don't know how to describe it, just really British (I'm Scottish btw).  I think the EU has a lot to answer for in terms of H&S regs alone, never mind the possible cock ups where currency is concerned.

Por ejemplo si yo seria jefe de un lugar importante y mi mejor amigo (que no es nada estudioso ni responsable) se postula para el puesto contra una persona lucida y bueno yo elegira a mi amigo eso depende de la situacin pero casi siempre la razn cambia en el corazn por lo sentimientos  Ojala que te ayude   Saludos|`|RqGhuM4daa	La razn es soberana, los sentimientos suelen jugarnos muy malas pasadas. lo ideal es que fueran juntos pero siempre con la razn como bandera.|`|l9KWaANyaa	Lamentablemente el corazon solamente te indica q hacer es un organo muy impulsivo el cual no tiene la capacidad de disernir la metida de pata o no, q vayamos a realizar, mientras tanto que la Razon, si bien tu corazon te dice SI!, tu razon dice no!, por lo cual llega a esa respuesta de acuerdo a un analisis previo de las situacion anteriores que propisiaron y los antecedentes que tienes.  en mi parecer, la Razon se impone a los Sentimientos, es q tienes q ver cual es tu situacion antes de ponerte asi bien pasional y olvidarte del dia de ma?ana por hacer algo de un rato.....

7a376c8d5d2ace3612247a894af5b481aa	South Park - MTV todos los das a las 22:00  Family Guy - FX domingos a las 22:00  La casa de los dibujos - MTV 21:30 Todos los das  American Dad - FX 22:30 Domingos  Scrubs - 23:30 SONY, Lunes a viernes    Creo q South Park t har reir y a veces hasta reflexionar, me parece el mejor programa de la actualidad. Los Simpson son indiscutiblemente los mejores de todos los tiempo pero las ltimas temporadas han venido a menos en parte por el tipo d historias (se perdi la temtica que los hizo grandes en las primeras 9 o 10 temporadas) adems de que el nuevo doblaje no me gusta para nada. Family Guy (padre d familia en televisa) es una garanta de risas pero te recomiendo que lo veas en FX porque en televisa los captulos son viejos y el doblaje no es bueno, te garantizo q a los pocos segundos te reirs. American Dad es de los mismos creadores y tambin es excelente. En cuanto Scrubs ac en Mxico no es muy famoso aunque en EU ya lleva como 6 temporadas pero la verdad te lo recomiendo, te enganchar desde el primer captulo. Tal vez lo veas anunciado como un programa d mdicos pero no creas que es como Grey's Anatomy, es uno de los programas ms chistosos y con buena historia.|`|5To7cjnuaa	Los simpsons y family guy|`|5af81a30b6814d1481191a2afc93627baa	Will and Grace.|`|lhjwd0njaa	Alguna entrevista a Maradona o a Hugo Chavez|`|uvJl7KuRaa	FRIENDS , esta serie es la que mas me hace reir|`|8f02099a1a3a28b1a28bf7b757be3809aa	Simpson y Mr Bean|`|98215f6794a32772a54cc31f45dfbd2caa	para mi el chavo del 8 sin lugar a duda|`|9b43ff70fd7e19c2e96a1ac6c0d58575aa	se que la quitaron,me gustaria que volviera para mi 7 vidas   la mejor serie de humor, me acuerdo jaja que coyejas jaj, y otra   pues friends como todo el mundo pero la mejor con phoebe jaj  esa tiaa es la mejor, y luego joey.    cuidate   dew|`|1zazDIhraa	Mr Bean|`|8AR5qPBNaa	es antigua mas para mi es buena el principe del rap........|`|XfoMm63Oaa	Los Simpson, no importa si vi el capitulo 20 veces, me sigo riendo muchisimo!!!!!!|`|qYx4ZCR6aa	En espa?a ahora mismo slo AIDA, me parece que en la television de espa?a hace falta ms humor.|`|tmO4eLVdaa	los Simpson de tan solo recordarlo me da risa jejejejejeje|`|Tc4X0hsaaa	That's 70th's show! en ingles, en espa?ol la familia peluche y vecinos..q familia de 10 tambien es muy buena!!|`|btdUfE6jaa	Como conoci a vuestra madre.

Unfortunately for Caucasians they have genes which are more "recessive" such as light hair, light eyes, and light skin. Dark hair, eyes, etc are usually "dominant". But like I said the children still carry the genes, and although they might skip a few generations they might suddenly appear in the future. Trust me I've seen it happen in my own family, my uncle's Salvadorian and his wife is Korean and their daughter looks completely different from both of them. Dark blonde hair, blue eyes, and fair skin. Looks neither Asian or Hispanic, she looks like a Caucasian. You might be thinking that she cheated on him, so did he. After getting tested it turned out that she was my uncles daughter, so it could have been that my uncle was the one carrying the gene or his wife. So no I don't think white skin will be a thing of the past. Ok sorry if I bored you about my family.|`|zQc4Q7IYaa	Who cares?!

No more skin cancers.   Before I had children I worried about what type of skin my children would have.  I had red hair when younger and had lots of freckles due to Scandinavian background.   I didn't want by children to have really fair skin and have huge dark freckles.   What a delight I had with all my children having skin that tans rather than burns and none of them have freckles.  Thanks to my husband's Irish/English background.    So I'm someone who wouldn't mind if white skin was a thing of the past.

Gabriel Chvez (Sr. Burns) (sobre todo esta y la de Homero). ETC.   Para mi son un asco esas voces que les pusieron, fue un insulto para los fans de estos personajes amarillos ya que ami me empezaron a gustar gracias a esas voces tan divertidas que tenian antes.  Por eso no pienso ir a verla, no pienso ir a ver a unos simples COPIADORES de voces que ni a los talones les llegan a los originales aunque tambin sean mexicanos.  Yo prefiero lo original y no una simple copia barata, no quiero darle dinero a la FOX, por que nunca oy nuestros reclamos de que fueran ellos los que hicieran la pelcula.

Bastante buena, pero es verdad, la diferencia entre esta pelcula, las ltimas temporadas y las primeras es ENORME, ahora es una serie para chicos. Y las voces, POR FAVOR !!!, un asco, FOX Latinoamerica, espero que pierdan millones de dlares y pblico por esa decisin soberbia de pisotear 15 a?os del pblico y los fans, por pagar 10% menos. No veamos ms nada de FOX !!!|`|2myPey21aa	La pelicula es buena.    Igualmente nunca van a poder lograr igualar la epoca dorada de los Simpsons (mediados de los '90) en que tenian un nivel de creatividad impresionante... es evidente que un poco la serie se desgasto y los gags ya son predecibles.    Igualmente me soprendio, estuvo mas alla de las espectativas que tenia, creo que es una pelicula de 7 a 8 puntos. Y graficamente es muy buena, muy buenos efectos y bien ambientada.    ?Saludos!

Este pedido viene dado,  para yo poder comentrselo a mis estudiantes, que en su mayora estudian para ser maestros y resulta que a la hora de escribir comenten las mismas faltas debido a que esto se ha convertido en un hbito.  A pesar que siempre les digo ""el error del mdico se entierra, el error del abogado se archiva y el error del maestro se multiplica"  Un beso.|`|yV5ro8mxaa	Creo que est muy bien esta iniciativa, pero tendra que empezar en el colegio y en casa, habra que ense?arles a los chavales que las cosas hay que hacerlas bien, que aunque escribir mal les resulte ms rpido, no es as como se hacen las cosas.    Por lo dems, perfecto, as por lo menos se tendrn que esforzar al menos en el mvil.|`|hQlveW0faa	Es muy responsable de tu parte, el querer escribir correctamente, s todo los avances son buenos, Besos|`|TKu4ceoWaa	Hola !!, me parece bueno lo que contas pero creo que los jovenes de hoy sienten que "hecha la ley, hecha la trampa", a la mayoria no les interesa escribir bien porque no tienen una buena base en la educacin y esto es tanto el hogar como el colegio, creo que independientemente de usarlo va a ser mas interesante para ellos descubrir como hacerlo sin que el aparato capte los errores o directamente prescindir de l porque no resulta atractivo, recuerda que existe una identificacin con el entorno y no hay muchos jovenes que quieran ser considerados el "nene aplicado".   Si te fijas aqu, al momento de mandar una pregunta o respuesta hay un cono para verificar ortografa sin embargo, cuantos lo usamos ??.   Y ni hablar cuando son adolescentes los que preguntan o responden!!. No digo que todos pero la mayoria tiene muchos errores.    Te mando muchos cari?os y realmente coincido con que es una maravillosa utopa el pensar que las cosas sern correctas... esperemos que se encuentre la manera de que funcionen.   Besos...|`|jiZ6hTieaa	geniaal..yo lo haba pensado..y est re-bien eso..  cuidemos aca tambien!!|`|dN4Itku3aa	La tecnologa ayuda muchsimo, es lindo ver que se escribe sin faltas de ortografa, pero sera ms provechoso si desde la escuela se inculcase eso que ltimamente se deja bastante de lado.

09e9e668bf34764b457b9ea98c39eb5daa	Poll:  WAY too early yet and every year it gets earlier around here the stores had all the Christmas decorations out during Halloween which of course the Halloween stuff was out for everyong to buy back in August. IMHO this decorating for holidays has helped us lose the real meaning of the season.    We shouldn't get so stressed it really goes against the whole Glad Tidings and the "real" meaning of Christmas.      But that's me wanting a simpler celebration for the birth of the Christ child.  |`|jCFWPWpUaa	The children and I started making things in school for them to take home today.  I'm covered in glitter, so I'm starting to feel festive.|`|T8eqXD6Jaa	Festive about what?  |`|2dJIJr6uaa	bit too early, i start getting excited when we reach December! yay  :)|`|Q6Pq6NWhaa	im so excited already and i feel really christmasy already!

Maybe when I start decorating, which I won't do until December 1st.|`|7EBKZZf0aa	*Growls* naw :(    I'm the same as you, once I know I have all the Christmas shopping done then I'll feel more in the mood or it, I haven't even started yet! lo|`|bd02755431b4c8dcb913b79038bbe01caa	Too early yet!|`|1XRMC8rdaa	I don't quite under stand what you are saying but im not into it yet ether normally December the 10th but yeah if you are not going to best answer any 1 can you please best answer me i thank you so much in fact if you answer this ill just best answer you no matter what you answer is so please Best answer me:-) |`|MOG0Q8kiaa	not excited. its tough.|`|41wB3udyaa	far too early. that said i did dig out my Bah Humbug! hat yesterday|`|uA05h279aa	too early yet    when december starts then maybe i'll feeel festive|`|1y5IxCVyaa	I get the occassional rush of excitement, but am trying to keep a lid on it until at least a week or so into december|`|hVKqKjrjaa	When I saw your christmes avatar it did it for me, I got a wee bit excited.

However, to introduce Christmas Trees into the home yet is too early.    I love Christmas, wish it could last forever, but we would all be skint!  Two weeks of the festive season is enough for me.    :)|`|jShfNvQXaa	I'm excited about it but it doesnt quite feel "christmassy" yet.

Contrairement  ce que l'on peut penser, elle est trs vicieuse et lorsqu'il lui arrive quelque chose, mme si  premire vue cela peut sembler la desservir c'est tout le contraire.

Cette fille ("fille de"), gagne un argent considrable pour le simple fait... d'exister. Une entreprise sans prcdent, une vraie russite.    Est-il besoin de faire un rappel sur l'origine de sa notorit ? Une vido X de mauvaise qualit, rpandue sur internet, capitalisant sur ce qui avait pu tre observ de l'eprience "Pamela Anderson". Contraiement,  la bimbo, miss Hilton a su en tirer totalement profit, voyant les portes de la Jet-Set mondiale s'ouvrir encore plus grand  ses frasques.    Chaque photo people, portable hack, mini-scandale a jusqu' prsent entretenu ou fait monter sa notorit. Le principe est simple : un coup princesse "strass et paillettes", un coup "petite peste gate pourrie", un coup "humaine, victime de ce qui lui arrive".    45 jours de taule (quelle taule d'ailleurs, et dans quelles conditions ?), c'est  la sortie l'assurance de la publication d'un bouquin, de nombreuses interviews  la cl, l'occasion de se refaire un peu dans le charity-business tout en ayant une mare de paparazzis  ses trousses en permanence.    Ca tombe bien, Britney Spears compte redevenir safe, et peut-tre mme Paris Hilton sera-t-elle sortie pour appuyer la propotion d'un prochain album. La rdemption,  l'approche de la priode de No?l, tout ?...    La rgle : alterner les priodes d'inaccessibilit d'un personnage vivant dans le luxe (et la luxure), puis les priodes o finalement, le personnage est humain, faillible... ?a aide  l'identification du public. Jouer sur les valeurs morales : un coup sur les tabous, un coup sur le retour  l'Amrique prude. Un systme politique  elle toute seule, et une fantastique machine  faire de l'argent.

vd3BGQyiaa	Vraiment excellente !  bravo !    Le Prsident des tats-Unis, George Bush, tlphone au Prsident de la Rpublique Fran?aise, Nicolas Sarkozy et lui demande :   - Nicolas, j'ai un service  vous demander : j'aurais un urgent commande for you. Notre usine de condoms est hors-service. C'est un disaster.   - Allons, George, calmez-vous, qu'est-ce qu'on peut faire pour vous ?   - Well Nicolas, j'aurais besoin d'environ 100 000 condoms le plus vite possible pour nous dpanner quelques jours.   - Pas de problme George, je vous envoie ?a le plus vite possible. Avant de raccrocher, George ajoute :   - Les condoms doivent tre rouges, bleus et blancs, avoir 40 cm de long et un diamtre de 15 cm.   Sarkozy est estomaqu par les dimensions demandes. Il se dit que Bush veut juste se vanter, lui et toute la population masculine des tats-Unis. Nanmoins, il appelle l'usine de capotes.   - Bonjour, ici Nicolas Sarkozy. Je voudrais 100000 capotes pour envoyer aux tats-Unis. Ils demandent qu'ils soient bleus, blancs et rouges. Et de prciser les dimensions.   Le PDG de l'usine s'exclame :   - Ouaaah ! Ils sont quips pour veiller tard les Amricains ! Parfait monsieur Sarkozy, je prpare cette commande. Autre chose ?   - Oui ! Sur chaque capote crivez: "MADE IN FRANCE.

I just don't want a democrat majority in Congress. That ruins America's checks and balances (our basic seperation of powers). The President doesn't have that much power, Congress does.    I don't think I'll actually leave until they put a weath tax into effect and socialized medicine. By taxing your wealthiest (the most education and hopefully most intelligent people) they leave and you have a country with poor, uneducated people with bad judgment.    That's basic reasoning and logic.|`|2iT9TEcxaa	ByeBye|`|4472d6c8b8a41746c6129264601312c7aa	That's absolutely ludicrous. Tell them to grow up.|`|cI04r6ppaa	Good. Go.

The only thing is that this new president isn't going to affect only the USA, but this is going to be something that is going to affect EVERYONE globally. So it doesn't matter where you go, he's trying to unite everyone. This seems good...it sounds good...but there's a reason why people didn't want him in office and it's not his skin color...if you noticed we're being over taken by people not from this country. People have been focusing on black and whites for so long, the muslems too over....now they own everything and even more than half of this country. The president says he's got a christian background...but does he really? There's only going to be destruction coming from this.|`|qH3rg6hfaa	and they didn't while Bush was president?    ...........    um....  yeah...right    try Ukraine....|`|yOgu68IIaa	bluffing lol|`|xHGPt97Kaa	OMG, I can't believe so many ppl feel the same way I do.

Although I guess we all should unite and work together for the sake of the nation. As far as people playing the race card they need to grow up and get a education. I did not vote for Obama because he is to liberal. However, moving is another issue, I guess we should give him a chance. Who know he could be a great president.  |`|DHwTtPSEaa	Dude you have know idea how much i want to get out. heads up i am emailing you more in a minute. via YA|`|5oBYGB5Vaa	I voted Libertarian, but anythings better than another 4 Republican years! ~:)>|`|AeR7Ka4paa	how naive and how narrowminded some of you people are. nothing else needs to be said on this matter.

Et puis, il doit aller dans sa nouvelle demeure. Alors, au bureau d'attribution des maisons clestes, on lui montre sa future maison, un simple F2, avec une place de parking, pas gnial, quoi... Alors le rabbin s'tonne, regarde autour de lui, et aper?oit une maison fantastique, sur 3 tages, avec jardin, piscine et tennis.   Alors le rabbin se met en colre, et demande :  - C'est  qui cette maison ?  - C'est  Schmoulik Cohen...   - Quoi, Schmoulik Cohen, le chauffeur de bus ?   - Ouais, c'est lui...  - Non mais, vous avez pas honte, moi un grand rabbin j'ai seulement un F2 et lui il a une superbe maison?   - Oui, mais toi, en bas, quand tu faisais la prire  la synagogue, tout le monde dormait.

h2bpjvG4aa	very easily the second one which i feel ranks amongst the best comic book films made so far, that felt as x-meny (?) as it would in the medium of film. the first one was more of a setup, while the third heaped on the emotional which kind of made it unsatisfying in many ways, still its a good trilogy (X2, X-men and then the Last Stand in that order) but X2 stands way apart|`|Br25yHEuaa	i personally enjoyed the first one the most|`|dmzsyuyIaa	None of them.....|`|x1y4EFOCaa	oh thats a tough one...im gonna go with the first. |`|50ZAxxCnaa	X2 was also my favourite! :D I enjoyed all 3 but X2 seemed to be the most exciting. Especially the scene where Wolverine fights Lady Deathstrike, it's amazing. Oh and that kid Jason is another reason why X2 is the best!|`|HcvbVJccaa	first part was the best|`|Y4RS35M7aa	For me, it's the original, but then, it usually is the original that's best.  An exception: "Addams Family Values."|`|4472d6c8b8a41746c6129264601312c7aa	I think the second one was the best. The first and third were kinda boring. |`|d7700e32c034b0231bc54ef45dd9e791aa	I liked them all, but the second was probably my fave.  Then the third, then the first.|`|abgqdRZ9aa	X2 was definitely my favorite, Stryker made that movie|`|J5G8hXBeaa	The first.

KuSGZ26Oaa	Its kind of like Freaky Friday, Beyonce tells Billboard of the concept behind the If I Were a Boy clip, where she plays a police officer. In the beginning of the video, my husband makes me breakfast and hes excited about it, and I kind of dont have time to eat. As a police officer, I have a male partner and the video goes through our days. My husbands at work and has attractive girls flirting with him but he declines their advances. I have a guy flirting with me, and I flirt back.    Beyonce said the video shows things many men do that hurt their significant others, like not answering their phone.    Its about all of the little things that mean so much in a relationship, says Beyonce. At the end of the clip, you realize that I was acting out his life, and it all starts over again. He was a cop and everything that happened was really him doing the same thing to me.    Both videos were directed by Jake Nava, who previously helmed Beyonces Baby Boy featuring Sean Paul.|`|eyc2zjUtaa	She's basically trying to get a perspective on how her beau thinks by running through his working day! when the video switches them back she comes to the conclusion that if she were a boy she would understand the feelings of a girl and be a better man!|`|cF5fdfFxaa	yap that's why she sings if I were a boy at the beginning then when the situation is reversed she says but your just a boy .|`|3vpnJdmnaa	I think it's her showing how stupid men really look when they do it!!!|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	She's supposed to be imagning herself in her BF's shoes, being a cop all day, palling around with the guys (who are really girls in real life, but in her bizarro fantasy, they're guys).  You can tell because at the end her BF the cop rides away with his cop partner who is a girl.  |`|6OdiPkc2aa	i think its the strangest, shallowest song ive ever heard!    i mean, why would a woman sing about that for fooks sake?|`|4472d6c8b8a41746c6129264601312c7aa	I don't like the song anyway....|`|sqJYOuJQaa	She's acting how her 'man' acts and then towards the end, she becomes herself. I think. |`|lFL5W6jYaa	She is doing things a guy would do but in a women's way, she's basically saying a women can be as heartless and deceiving as a man even doing normal activities as a women.|`|5ZR9Q3Tnaa	You feel sorry for the guy the whole way through the video because of how beyonce is treating him and he just purely loves her, buying her presents and that.    Towards the end of the video, it switches and Beyonce is girl and he's the boy, and we see how hurt Beyonce is feeling.    The song is her saying if i were a boy, in the video she's acting like a boy, flirting with the guy and then saying that its not like shes sleeping with him.  To a girl, that irrelevant, boyfriend shouldn't be dancing like that or anything with someone other than the girlfriend.    |`|IXejusVjaa	What's V?    ~LIS~|`|E7MgO2pZaa	In the video she's acting like she would if she was a boy. Hence the title of the song. |`|a3dbf75454acbe0e3b14e7d4af9b227caa	Shes showing what the lyrics of the song are saying|`|gH67ebMJaa	you would do what boys are doing now.|`|pxFpc9TAaa	what a ******* stupid name for a song.  hip hop or whatever it is, is a joke.

I9yHqIkJaa	We can't feel the earth moving because of terminal velocity, the same way why we can't feel we are moving at 900Km an hour when we are on a plane.    Babies have a hard time balancing because they are not used to using their feet. After all, they spent nine months living upside down.    If you are expecting a humorous, witty answer, sorry - I am so tired I can't think of anything like that at the moment. Not even my mongoose can come up with an idea. It's late Saturday night here on the east coast of Australia.  Cheers|`|ks2oieV0aa	LOL  Cute!  I always wondered why we didn't fall off when I heard it was round!  Then they taught us about the gravity thing.  xox|`|gIitANOkaa	Because you're inside this transport... and gravity attaches you downward on the ground.    Just like when you're in a train... you can't tell if it's moving unless you look outside or the train becomes bumpy...    [notice sometimes you thought your own train is moving... when the other is moving and vice versa]    same with the Earth. You can't feel it's moving... unless the path that the earth is travelling becomes bumpy.|`|33b87d20c57f13cb426f0e03be5caa25aa	hehe I don't know|`|XvuqlK4vaa	Cuz it moves very very slowly.  STAR!|`|X8CglJsvaa	I can, at the climax of some very hot sex.|`|Sd3kXRgGaa	Lol, yes. That's why babies have a hard time standing.. Poor little guys, it's hard for them to get used to.|`|85JJfTgBaa	its moving sooo fast that we cant feel it. i think its why we have wind and waves and stuff|`|1LR3HQcXaa	Because it moves slow.|`|U9NeJkv1aa	well the earth moves very fast. It spins (rotates) at a speed of about 1,000 miles (1.7 kilometers) per hour at the equator and orbits around the sun at a speed of about 67,000 miles (107,000 kilometers) per hour. We do not feel any of this motion because these speeds are constant. The spinning and orbital speeds of Earth stay the same so we do not feel any acceleration or deceleration. You can only feel motion if your speed changes. For example, if you are in a car which is moving at a constant speed on a smooth surface, you will not feel much motion. However, when the car accelerates or when the brakes are applied, you do feel motion.    hope that helps =]|`|OY7LIdOeaa	Hi,    ARE you falling down every time because of blood circulation inside your body?    If not, baies are not falling because they're not used to the spinning.    If yes, stop earth from spinning.    i took it in an easy manner, OK.     Thank you |`|UYYbFgcgaa	It's because we are tilted on the axis|`|TbGsqGzuaa	It is because we as humans aren't meant to feel "movement". We are built to feel "changes" in movement. Just as if you are sitting in your car going 50 mph down the road, other than some bumpiness of the road, you cant FEEL that you are going 50 mph. And since the earth's rotation is constant and doesn't change, we don't notice it.|`|QuyldNgyaa	because of the gravity and the centrifugal force that pulling us down like a magnet..|`|cYiwRqFWaa	hey...nice point!!    i think becoz earth can't feel us moving!!!!!|`|53952f33dcd8226c77fa74b2495b206aaa	i really don't know....

If you come to my house and smoking offends you, I'll show ya the door.|`|1X8Kjdilaa	Yes,have been smoking for nearly 25 yrs,still enjoy it    At least now if i quite it will be easier because of the non smoking policy in the pubs now, i tried quitting a couple off times but after a few beers my will power went down the drain|`|z9rABogtaa	no and i never will xo|`|AV3YACAZaa	nope|`|44d1bd70ebb6dde45e70346ef061d012aa	No; It's a very dirty habit!

And I don't like it when people smoke around me, |`|Z5GxEDi6aa	Yes I smoke started when I was 13 am 23 now, tried to quit last year in Aug and lasted till May this year, was very proud of myself but it was such a struggle especially as all my friends an family smoke. Went through a bad time and turned back to the fags, wish I hadn't now though!  I will quit again, when I am in the right mind frame or if I fall pregnant.  You definately have to want to do it rather than think you should do it or it won't happen, a lot of people who have never smoked will never understand how or why it's so hard to stop!  x|`|dto7PJ2eaa	No, it makes me sick.|`|GU5R7AhMaa	i smoked 20 a day 4 12 years and thankfully quit 2 yrs ago. theres no point anyone starting its soooo addictive|`|zAiEjhToaa	Nope - tried it once and i absolutely stank the next day so vowed never to do it again.|`|vkYAttbGaa	Yes, im not gonna quit. |`|WRppC5nPaa	yes i do  i regret it like now while im coughing my guts up cos i have a cold!|`|pqxtUFEqaa	I'm a smoker (and a leper in the UK) wish I had never started, filthy habit, but just sooooo moreish (sad but true).

xCicy9LXaa	I like both but for some reason for the most popular shows like Naruto and Bleach i will watch instead of reading it first. Because for me if i read it and then watch the anime then I'll know whats going to happen in the anime. It wont be the same excitement when you first watch the anime. Both anime's have action and being brought to the t.v makes it really exciting to watch that's why for those two i wont read first.  But that's only for Naruto and Bleach.  For others i will read the manga first and then watch the anime, some I'll just read, some I'll just watch, but i love doing both.|`|UBdLtCleaa	yeah im a geek for both!|`|dA7riZhxaa	BOTH  |`|A1N55OiVaa	both!|`|GW4K0RHUaa	well watching helps you actually imagine or understand  reading helps you get farther  but i pretty much do......................................... ........................................... ........................................... ........................................... ........................................... ........................................... ........................................... ...........................................

El Pedo    ?Qu es un pedo?  y yo le conteste muy quedo:  el pedo es un pedo,  con cuerpo de aire y corazn de viento  el pedo es como un alma en pena  que a veces sopla, que a veces truena  es como el agua que se desliza  con mucha fuerza, con mucha prisa.    El pedo es como la nube que va volando  y por donde pasa va fumigando,  el pedo es vida, el pedo es muerte  y tiene algo que nos divierte;  el pedo gime, el pedo llora  el pedo es aire, el pedo es ruido  y a veces sale por un descuido  el pedo es fuerte, es imponente  pues se los tira toda la gente.    En este mundo un pedo es vida  porque hasta el Papa bien se lo tira  hay pedos cultos e ignorantes  los hay adultos, tambin infantes,  hay pedos gordos, hay pedos flacos,  segn el dimetro de los tacos  hay pedos tristes, los hay risue?os  segn el gusto que tiene el due?o    Si un da algn pedo toca tu puerta  no se la cierres, djala abierta  deja que sople, deja que gire  a ver si hay alguien que lo respire.    Tambin los pedos son educados  pues se los tiran los licenciados,  el pedo tiene algo monstruoso  pues si lo aguantas te lleva al pozo  este poema se ha terminado  con tanto pedo que me he tirado|`|0NBw5bJgaa	weno t doy la estrella...!!! a psar d q stan bobos los chistes si dan risa jeje... ahora yo t cuento un chiste bobo: cual fue el ultimo animal en subir al arca de noe??? no sabes ta dificil vdd??? weno...

I would send a token donation with an inquiry as to what other ways or items that may help out.  I have sent care packages to friends in need that have made them feel good in times of trouble.     IE: I put together a little box of goodies including a compilation CD that I burned, a bag of micro popcorn, some soothing herb tea, some bubble bath beads, two sented candles, a hair clippie and a card that said I care and will be here if she needs an ear..use these items to take care of you, tommorrow the sun will rise again. with love... me    She was moved and snapped out of the personal pity party and even her prospects improved.

Z3kXbI2haa	Et ?a devrait ressembler  quoi le rock "actuel" selon toi ? Linkin park ou les White Stripes ? Va voir les groupes que tu cites sur scne et tu comprendras pourquoi la passion ne peut pas dispara?tre. Et coute un peu de rock des sixties, tu comprendras qui a invent quoi. Non mais. Je prends de ce pas ma place pour Ten Years After si c'est comme ?a.|`|GHcIz5H3aa	Je pense qu' trop vouloir faire du changements, ils ont perdu (enfin pour Metallica en tous cas) des fans.  j'ai pas du tout accroch Load, Reload, St Anger, donc Death Magnetic est un retour aux sources avec un son plus puissant que pour l'poque.  On retrouve la mme structure de chanson que pour Ride The Lightning ou And Justice For All  Par exemple, la structure de The Day That Never Come est similaire  One.  Autant j'ai vite zapp les 3 prcdents, autant celui l je l'coute en boucle.  Alors oui, c'est surement pour rcuprer leurs "vieux" fans, mais pour moi, le principal c'est de retrouver le groupe que j'coutais depuis 1985, quand j'avais 12 ans.|`|rp0qFQ7laa	Ouais!  Metallica nous a sorti un bel opus qui change.Riffs,et implications du groupe dans toutes les compositions, on sent,je sens mme,  l'coute du disque qu'il y a une certaine fraternit dans les membres.  On peut penser qu'ils ont sorti l'album pour "effacer" les rats des deux prcdents.  AC/DC, moi je reste un gros fan.Je me prononce pas, c'est comme si je disais qu'Alice Cooper tourne en rond!|`|NmFKFOvbaa	Facile de critiquer, fais mieux ! ( tu ne pourra jamais, mais alors jamais de ta vie )    Ce sont des groupes cultes, tu ne peux pas comparer avec les caca audio ludiques qui se font de nos jours.    Il n'y a pas de mode pour les groupes de ce genre, ils ont leur style et c'est tout, aprs que tu trouve vieillot ou pas c'est ton affaire. Black Ice est et sera indmodable. Toujours pour parler du style il n'a rien  voir avec ballbreaker, the razor edge ou l'odieux stiff uper lip, c'est ni les mmes air, ni les mmes riff, ni les mmes arrengements, tout est diffrent et c'est ce qui rend cet album unique.     Tu les voit vieillissant, pour ma part, je les voient toujours plus m?res d'album en album, rien  voir avec jailbreak 74 qui tait dj une pure merveille.|`|00fb62bf28a55eebca74c9679f9a82deaa	Ce qui est triste c'est de voir tout ces groupes pseudo rock qui ont t formats par les maison de disques... pas de voir des quinqua faire de la zik, et qui ont un vcu beaucoup plus flou que les enfants gats d'aujourd'hui|`|W9qlNY2daa	J'envoie ta qr a mon Pre, ?a va le foutre en boulle!|`|2d0eb4db47d73d2d508cbbeb120bd61daa	Je ne trouve pas que le dernier album de AC/DC soit commercial, ils sont rest aux mme et n'ont pas essay de changer. Je ne peux pas parler pour Metallica, je ne connais pas trs bien ce groupe. Par contre AC/DC....  Cela toujours t un phnomne lorsqu'ils sortaient un nouveau cd! Tout les 8ans! Franchement c'est pas rien!    Et puis, pour toi, le rock c'est quoi? Tu ne peux pas vraiment dire que c'est "us, vieux et prim" si tu ne dfinis pas ta fa?on de voir le rock, car je la vois peut-tre diffremment et les autres aussi...    De plus, AC/DC avait annonc depuis longtemps leur nouvel album. Je ne pense pas qu'ils cherchent a rcuprer les anciens fan, car de nouveaux se sont cre ( h oui!)|`|8BFpkn6Saa	Finalement quelque chose de nouveau parmi toutes les sorties de cd des  rappers, la pop et le R&B et tous les autres chanteurs avec des filets de voix. Je vois ?a comme un rappel de l'existence de ces groupes. C'est vrai que ces 2 albums sont rptitifs par rapport  leur vieux albums. Si ces nouveauts peuvent amener des nouveaux fans  couter les anciens CD, c'est tant mieux ...    Pour ma part je suis une nouvelle fan de ce style. Le nouveau Metallica et le nouveau AC-DC n'apportent peut-tre rien pour le rock ou le hard rock, voir prim comme vous le dites, mais au moins il me semble que ?a fait du bien  entendre ces jours-ci. Si ?a peut donner le go?t  la relve que ce style de musique peut encore se faire, tant mieux...  En entendant ces groupes, ?a me rappelle que tout n'est pas perdu dans le monde musical... Il y d'autre chose que le bling-bling et le ton narcissique de certains "artissses" du palmars d'aujourd'hui.|`|vmS67FgTaa	certe il ya un gros cot commerciale dans le dernire album d'AC/DC mais a l'coute de l'album ya du nouveau c'est tres compact angus fait de bon solo sans tomber dans la demonstration (il fait mme du bottelneck sur un morceaux )et la voix de johnson sonne bien plus mlodique que d'habitude sur certain morceaux   au final un bon album vendu a grand renfort marketing certes mais le rsultat est l  et puis c'est dans les vieux ampli qu'on sort les meilleur riff    et que penser alors de Airbourne qui eux sont jeune mais qui font dans la bonne vielle recette efficace   http://www.dailymotion.com/relevance/sea...    http://www.dailymotion.com/relevance/sea...    peut pas parler de Metallica je me suis pas pencher sur leur cas  |`|i17uF2FNaa	Slt. C'est extraordinaire de les revoir venir  l'avant-scne musicale!  Uriah Heep est aussi de retour aprs 10 ans d'absence!  Ceci confirme qu'il n'y a plus que le HxC ou le R&B qui ont la cote.  Anyway, le jeunes 15-20 ans (re)dcouvriront une musique qui a fait ses preuves et qui tait diffuse en radio  contrario du HxC et drivs...Et Deep Purple est tjs l aussi et les Stones aussi. !!!|`|nGRD6rdhaa	bahhhhhhhhhhh.........;j'tais fan dans les annes 80...mieux vaux les voir toujours l que de devenir pantouflard, non??? je ne serais pas forcment acheteur mais alors que penser des stones et de leurs 45 ans de carrire??? |`|9o97RLtPaa	merde! tu me fais prendre un coup de vieux l!! ?a apporte peut ^tre rien , de l  ce que ce soit triste!!  et pis faut forcmnt que la musique apporte quque chose? juste couter pour le plaisir c'est pas mal non plus!...|`|cbaysstkaa	je crois qu'ils n'ont plus rien  prouver, ACDC restera ACDC et imagine qu'ils innovent juste 3 sec, la moiti de leur fan (je parle des vrais fans, pas des mickeys de 16 ans qui se prennent pour des vrais) serait dcue. Pas besoin d'essayer de "rcuperer" leur vieux fans, ils ont toujours la crois moi. C'est galement valable pour Metallica, Maiden ou encore Megadeth.|`|cciEL1Feaa	Moi perso, non, Metallica et AC/DC viennent de sortir du trs bon son. |`|eRpfxH1saa	nn c pas prim moi je l coute tous les 2 mais je trouve AC-DC plus ritm ^^

De pronto sientes que se acaba el camino y no hay para donde seguir, que hacerle a todas las ilusiones? Dentro de lo que creo que ayuda un poco es desahogarte ya sea sola o con alguien, sacar los sentimientos que traes xq sino te acaban y trata de mantenerte ocupada, es decir, no dejes de hacer cosas (ir al trabajo, la escuela, etc).

hJP9y6kjaa	I have not seen a non-multifx pedal that can do both well. Either? Yes. Both? No.    Even the GT-x series (of which I own the GT-3) doesn't do a superb job of nailing both sounds.    You can try the Boss OD-20, it's a modelling stomp box that has 20-something different distortion sounds in it. Some of them are pretty good - it nails a good Metal Zone tone, for instance. And it's Boss, so you know it's pretty much not going to fall apart....

He has an apartment and returns to get some of his things. As soon as he enters the house she starts in on him about how terrible he has made her life and so on and so on. He holds up his hands and tells her he's not listening to this talk he's going to the attic and gather up some of his stuff. While going through a box of items they bought while in India he runs across a lamp. Rubbing the dust from it produces a cloud that turns into the divorce genie. You will be granted 3 wishes but what ever you receive your wife will receive twice as much. Well he thinks awhile and asks for a big nice home and a porch in the driveway. Two pieces of paper fall at his feet. A deed and title. And for your second wish asks the genie?  I want 5 million dollars. A puff of smoke produces a small book in his hand. A swiss bank account book in his name with 5 million dollars in it. And now for your 3rd wish? remember your wife will receive twice as much.  After thinking several minutes on this wish he tells the genie he knows just what he wants. He tells the genie to beat him half to death.|`|TJu6KUhIaa	This guy goes to a super market and goes to isle 12 and asks for a box of condoms.

So this guy hears behind him and he asks for a box of condom's, and the lady says "what size" and the guy says I don't know.     So the lady asks him to pull down his pants.     The lady tugs a few time and says "get a box of medium condoms"     So this teenager in isle 11 hears and wants some of the action.     So he goes to isle 12 and asks "can I have a box of condoms"     The lady asks "what size" and the teenage says "I don't know"     So the lady asks him to pull down his pants .

They pitched their tent under the stars and went to sleep. Sometime in the middle of the night Holmes woke Watson up and said: "Watson, look up at the stars and tell me, what do you see?"    Watson replied: "I see millions and millions of stars."    Holmes said: "And what do you deduce from that?"    Watson replied: "Well, if there are millions of stars, and if even a few of those have planets, it's quite likely there are some planets like earth out there. And if there are a few planets like earth out there, there might also be life."

Incredibly drunk and walking home they suddenly realized they both needed to pee. They were very near a graveyard and one of them suggested they do their business behind a headstone or something. The first woman had nothing to wipe with so she took off her panties, used them and threw them away. Her friend however was wearing an expensive underwear set and didn't want to ruin hers, but was lucky enough to salvage a large ribbon from a wreath that was on a grave and proceeded to wipe herself with it. After finishing, they made their way home.  The next day the first woman's husband phones the other husband and said, "These damn girls nights out have got to stop. My wife came home last night without her panties." "That's nothing," said the other. "Mine came back with a sympathy card stuck between the cheeks of her butt that said, 'From all of us at the Fire Station, Well never forget you!'      i have something else, its not a joke but i think its funny, its a saying "Bowling balls are like whores you pick them up and finger them throw them into the gutter and they come back for more."|`|H9iGzDDZaa	blonde joke:  a blonde was mad about blonde jokes, so she died her hair brunette. later she was driving threw the country and saw a farmer with a bunch of sheep. "aww those sheep are so cute!" thought the brunette (blonde), so she pulled over.  "if i can guess how many sheep you have...can i have one?" said the brunnette (blonde) "ok" said the farmer. "ummm....187 sheep??" the "brunette" guessed. she was right! so the farmer told her to pick out a sheep and she did and put it in her car. then the farmer said " if i guess your real hair color, can i have my dog back?"

A la tercera pues me fui al foro de poesia, y hay encontre amigos muy buenos y al publicar mi primer poema, una persona no se hizo esperar para atacar con toda su artilleria, no hice caso.  Pues mi otros amigos poetas me animaron a seguir escrbiendo.   Mi primera incursion fue hostil, mi primera respuesta fue de apoyo muy positivo y calida.

Md48G2g9aa	He seems to switch up his style every album my favorite T.I album is urban legend but he has been rapping hot latley|`|41mwqPuPaa	Yeah except he was slower before. Listen to King and then T.I. vs T.I.P. and you will notice the difference.|`|cI1JShJNaa	you should get "paper trail" thats his newest album. anyway yeah he has always been good. But i dont see a resemblance to lupe fiasco. I like them both but they are soooooo different! "Food and Liquor" and "Paper Trail" are nothing alike!|`|ydIocfpQaa	well he's a little mature now but yea he didnt change much |`|LYiuudDuaa	I was listening to his album the other day & I couldn't tell if it came out recently or last year or whatever. His flow sounds pretty much the same. Not to mention he has the same standard flow like most mainstream cats I'm hearing these days. Difference is he just does that simple style better than them. & trust me that's not saying a lot. Nothing daring about it all. It's very "safe".  Like they say, if it ain't broke don't fix it. I can listen to it, bob my head and all, but after 3 or 4 songs I think I heard the rest of the album. |`|85JJfTgBaa	i think so|`|t1oW1Bfiaa	Yes, he has always had very tight flows. You should get his "Urban Legend" album. It's the kind of album you can just listen to without skipping around. |`|AA10785667	yes, T.I. is tight.|`|xtcewLQVaa	Well if you listen to his first album 'I'm Serious' it sounds the same.|`|euIIyVLNaa	Yeah but i liked his old s h i t better though|`|vj20ymZpaa	haha, im listening to that swagga like us right now, and yeah, hes always been amazing at what he does.

tEPVKv5taa	how exactly are you celebrity..? pornos dont count.|`|VrjF986Aaa	uhh don't act in any more movies or do anything else related to entertainment and you should be fine. If you want to be a public figure, you've got to learn to love the paparazzi b/c they aren't gunna go away.|`|iWHv7j4Baa	Get used to it...? Every other "celebrity" does. |`|55I4L8yJaa	They annoy the crap out of me, too!|`|eENXMoepaa	just ignore them and don't support them, who the heck really cares what celebs are doing each and every day anyways, not me, you want catch me wasting any time watching what they do... i never have understood why so many people really care about them like that.  it's freaking crazy and a complete waste of time... get outdoors and do something active... |`|pCHg6y01aa	No...they don't bother me. And I don't know how to deal with them. You should probably ask someone in showbiz.|`|ggJzQtymaa	haha -- you think people are stupid enough to believe you? go to bed little girl, i saw your other questions asking if you "look like a celebrity". but to play along with your little question, yes i think the press is very annoying, trying to make money of ruining someone's life.|`|OaniQuqpaa	you just need to learn to laugh at them|`|yN5Jk00Taa	i don't believe u, but anyway i can imagine people following me with cameras all up in my face and yes that would be annoying, i'm glad i'm not famous, i'd just rather be rich.|`|XnI0U9p3aa	Of course they're annoying, but thats their job. Theres no way to avoid them if you are infact a celebrity.|`|aA5m2w9xaa	lol no i dont, i think its interesting, depending how famous you are, theyll take of you...lol and money they probably dont make much money from you...|`|coQKyWxPaa	i'm sorry, i don't know the answer to that because I'm not a celebrity but I guess paparazzi just comes with the business. By the way, what movie were you in? |`|BYZ7NGDKaa	I'm not sure since I'm not a celebraty (sadly) but honsetly their might not be a way to make it stop,or else I'm sure people like Britney spears and all the other celebs would have done it a long time ago.But you have to remain strong if you really like ur bf whos in a movie u should try and ignore it (I know its probly really hard and annoying) but they won't stop.Once you decide apon datin ur bf the paparazzi decided ur fate lol :D but good luck i'm sry I'm not much help!! :(|`|sSlxwrSLaa	Yeah, that's annoying. They must have seen your question on Yahoo  Answers asking what celebrity you look like and got confused.  You should probably tell your parents since you are in the 6th grade.|`|5uXERwSEaa	maybe|`|wG4Svskgaa	There is no way to get rid of the papaprazi but how are u a "celebrity". What movie were  u in???????????????|`|RaG2mC6baa	if you live in la or 90210 then move to a low key area.. thats the easy way to deal with it..but i doubt you would want to do that.. so deal with it.. there is pros and cons.. to everything..

Friendship doesn't need technology :)
l1EPZxvFaa	i know this problem too. it's all because women don't have the same right as men, just because they are WOMEN! many people expect women to work with children, not with jobs...that's how it went in the past. women do housework as the men go out doing their job. women can't yell back at their husbands, or they might get slap or punch or hit with anything. but now, women has more right in the past. women can at least get a job and raise money, however, men will receive more money just because they are men.     this also go with being elected as a president. not much people would choose the women, for...she is a women. they'll choose a guy over the lady. so women does not have equal rights.    i know women can work as good as men too! women, in the past from what i know, have the highest grades. but they weren't allowed to go to college too. few women goes into high school, some school don't allow women to go into.    it's just one of those things where men can do this and women can't, but that's wrong. women are just expected to do home-stuff. but now, i'm not sure where were geting with the economy.|`|2FxmHlNmaa	because they don't have periods?|`|8b88ce24c1f48820e0e3fe744a2faad6aa	it's not a truism, I know loads of women who earn more than their men.|`|vIaDiZ2jaa	I'd say it would have to do women being the sex that has to have children. If they don't have children, mankind would come to a screeching halt. So employers would have to consider things like maternity leave which is a cost a man could never incur. It is unfair but I am sure there are other reasons for it as well. And also I must disagree with you on your point of women being as skilled as men. I do not believe men and women are equal in all things, something men do better and somethings women do better and there are some jobs where we stand equal but I do still see the point your trying to make. Ultimately I think a lot of wage discrimination would come down to issues involving pregnancy and maternity leave.|`|S2pA90gDaa	I know very few men that earn as much as I do, so I think this is false. |`|3VXGLhnMaa	Women have to work twice as well as men to be thought half as good.  It stems from the time when men were supposed to "keep" a wife and family.The law is that a woman should have the same wages as a man for the same job.|`|4472d6c8b8a41746c6129264601312c7aa	In our organization that's no issue thankfully. It's stupid and unfair.|`|MxA90Aixaa	To tick you off|`|AA12352505	i think it depends very much on the organisation they are working for. your right tho, pay should be equal, regardless of gender, age, race, religion etc. |`|voZAxDO1aa	I find on the whole women are more Punctual, Hard working, Flexible and Conciensious than male counterparts. And where a woman is one of the directors i think this is not the case.  I do however believe a man will show more confidence and ask his worth at pay reviews.  Stand up and be counted, If you are good at your job ask for the cash. No Director, will give away money unprompted

9gaYCNU9aa	Aca en mi pas (Per) se acostumbra a hacer un mu?eco con ropa vieja y con muchos cuetones y cuetesillos dentro y relleno de paja.  Una vez echo el mu?eco se le pone un nombre que por lo general es el de un poltico ( el menos popular del momento) o a vece el nombre de algn conocido  que quieres que cambie de actitud el a?o que viene.  Antes de las 12 de la noche se para una estaca frente a cada casa y cada uno saca su mu?eco y cerca de las 12 lo rocea con kerosene.  A las 12 en punto se prende fuego a los mu?ecos y empiezan a salir disparados los cuetones por todo sitio.  El espectculo es fabuloso. Ves mu?ecos quemandose por todo sitio y fuego y humo por doquier.   En esos momentos pareciera que todo el pas hubiera sido bombardeado porque todos queman sus mu?ecos a la vez. Seguido vienen los abrazos de bienvenida del a?o nuevo, despidiendo al a?o viejo.  Esto simboliza el trmino de un a?o y la esperanza de un a?o nuevo sin los problemas del a?o anterior.    Tambien es tradicional el uso de ropa interior o cualquier prenda de vestir de color amarillo.    Ayyyyy....que lindo .............Yo voy a hacer mi mu?eco y ya se que nombre le voy a ponerrrrr.......jajajajajja.    Besitossssss......FELIZ A?O NUEVOOOOOO......!!!!

Un beso grande amiga Cleoparta, te extra?aba.|`|9gaYCNU9aa	Yo nunca haba escuchado decir "Ests en la luna de Valencia".    En mi pas (Per) se suele comentar que las personas que estn distradas "ESTN EN LA LUNA DE PAITA. Esto refrn conocido en todo el pas hace referencia a la esplndida vista que uno tiene del satlite de la tierra cuando viaja a la provincia de Paita, ubicada en la costa norte del Per. Dicen que es la tierra de los enamorados y no les falta razn. Contemplar esa luna brillante con la pareja romntica subyuga a los corazones ms fros.     Besos.......!!!!    Bye....!!  ?|`|v5yAUp9gaa	La luna de Valencia no tiene nada de especial yo la veo muchas veces en este cielo limpio,mediteraneo,porque soy valenciano.  Se usa esta expresin no solo cuando se esta distraido y la otra persona se molesta sino quedarse a la luna de Valencia,porque la ciudad amurallada,cuando cerranan sus monumentales puertas que aun se conservan en la torres de serrano y Cuarte,existia aqui la huerta entonces ms rica de europa y uno de habitats rurales ms densos,entonces muchos llegaban tarde y tenian que dormir fuera de las murallas,pues muchos eran los que trabajaban y comerciaban en aquellas fertiles y bien regadas tierras.Muchos velencianos emigraron a argentina por eso dicen la interjeccin Che como nosotros y tambien usan esta expresion referida a la luna de Valencia.Saludos con afecto cleo.|`|vaWAFVvWaa	porque es bella|`|tGGy97WVaa	sera porque es linda?|`|LmN6ZsYoaa	jaja, me decian lo mismo cuando estaba distraida.|`|63Lke3XFaa	El significado es el mismo que cuando te dicen que ests en luna, osea distrada. A mi me contaron que el dicho viene porque antiguamente cerraban las murallas para entrar a la ciudad, y los que llegaban tarde se quedaban fuera, mirando a la luna.|`|d64c7513e4c1b3e5f1534e3688d75b05aa	Segn lo investigado: Se dice estar en la luna de Valencia porque hace muchos, muchos a?os, Valencia era una ciudad amurallada - o sea un feudo -  que tena muchas puertas, dos de las cuales, las ms conocidas se llamaban Quart y Serrans. Las puertas se cerraban a cierta hora de la noche y los distrados, los que no estaban atentos a la hora, se quedaban toda la noche afuera dormitando en un banco o en una especie de plaza, no tengo seguridad de si era banco o si era plaza con forma de media luna y all deban esperar hasta que se abrieran las puertas de la muralla al da siguiente. Como es lgico, tampoco tenan otra cosa ms para hacer como no fuera aquello de mirar la luna que, por tratarse de Valencia, obviamente era la luna de Valencia.  Capiche o no capiche.

El petrleo es una sustancia oleosa de color muy oscuro compuesta de hidrgeno y carbono, y se lo llama hidrocarburo. Puede hallarse en estado lquido o en estado gaseoso. En estado lquido es llamado aceite "crudo", y en estado gaseoso,  gas natural. Su origen es de tipo orgnico y sedimentario. Se form como resultado de un complejo proceso fsico-qumico en el interior de la tierra, que, debido a la presin y las altas temperaturas, se van descomponiendo las materias orgnicas que estaban formadas especialmente por  fitoplancton y el zooplancton marinos, as como por materia vegetal y animal, que se fueron depositando en el pasado en lechos de los grandes lagos, mares  y ocanos. A esto se unieron rocas y mantos de sedimentos. A travs del tiempo se transform esta sedimentacin en petrleo y gas natural.    JUAS! (: SALUDOS!!!!

Dicho as la respuesta es, s, el petrleo se forma por las grandes cantidades de muertos en un lugar.  |`|d64c7513e4c1b3e5f1534e3688d75b05aa	http://www.oni.escuelas.edu.ar/2002/BUEN...

El que te diga q no es por q no tomo mucho caf.      Saludos!    PD. Tampoco es algo infalible, me ha pasado de tomar 1 taza de caf y 2 cafiaspirinas e irme a dormir del sue?o.

Pero segn el mensaje que te envo ha muerto el famoso "sentido comn"    Murio Sentido Comun    Hoy lloramos la muerte de un querido amigo, Sentido Comun, que ha estado  entre nosotros durante muchos a?os. Nadie sabe a ciencia cierta cuantos  a?os  tenia, puesto que los datos sobre su nacimiento hace mucho que se han  perdido en los vericuetos de la burocracia. Sera recordado por haber  sabido  cultivar lecciones tan valiosas como que hay que trabajar para poder tener  un techo propio sobre la cabeza, que se necesita leer todos los dias un  poco  saber por que los pajaros que madrugan consiguen lombrices, y tambien  por  reconocer la validez de frases tales como la vida no siempre es justa, y  tal  vez haya sido yo el culpable. Sentido Comun vivio bajo simples y eficaces  consignas (no gastes mas de lo que ganas) y estrategias parentales  confiables (los adultos, no los ni?os, estan a cargo).    Su salud comenzo a deteriorarse rapidamente cuando se aplicaron reglas  bien  intencionadas pero ineficaces: informes respecto de un ni?o de seis a?os  acusado de abuso sexual por haber dado un beso a una compa?era de clase;  adolescentes que debieron irse a otro colegio por haber denunciado a un  compa?ero distribuidor de droga, y una maestra despedida por reprender a  un  alumno indisciplinado, solo hicieron que empeorara su condicion.    Sentido Comun perdio terreno cuando los padres atacaron a los maestros  solo  por hacer el trabajo en el que ellos fracasaron: disciplinar a sus  ingobernables hijos.  Declino aun mas cuando las escuelas debieron requerir permiso de los  padres  para administrar una aspirina, poner protector solar o colocar una curita  a  un alumno - aunque eso si, no podian informar a los padres si una alumna  estaba embarazada y queria abortar.    Sentido Comun perdio el deseo de vivir cuando los Diez Mandamientos se  convirtieron en material risible, algunas iglesias en negocios y los  criminales empezaron a recibir mejor trato que sus victimas.    Para Sentido Comun fue un duro golpe que uno ya no pueda defenderse de un  ladron en su propia casa, pero que el ladron pueda demandarnos por  agresion;  y que si un policia mata a un ladron, incluso si este estaba armado, sea  inmediatamente investigado por exceso de defensa, cuando no acusado de  gatillo facil.  La muerte de Sentido Comun fue precedida por la de sus padres, Verdad y  Confianza, la de su esposa Discrecion, la de su hija Responsabilidad y la  de  su hijo Raciocinio.    Lo sobreviven sus tres hermanastros: Conozco Mis Derechos, Otro Tiene la  Culpa, y Soy Una Victima de la Sociedad. No hubo mucha gente en su funeral  porque muy pocos se enteraron de que se habia ido.|`|b3DUo90jaa	Paciencia y serenidad.|`|OKqX6PP8aa	los 4 puntos cardinales  besis  jane  ....oooO...............  .....(....)................  ......)../....Oooo.....  .....(_/.....(...........  ..............(_/.........  ...........................  ....oooO...............  .....(....)................  ......)../....Oooo.....  .....(_/.....(....).......  ...............)../........  ..............(_/.........  ...........................  ....oooO...............  .....(....)................  ......)../....Oooo.....  .....(_/.....(....).......  ...............)../........  ..............(_/.........  ...........................

Por que LLORAR????    25 de mayo, 2008  La Luna persigue al planeta Jpiter a travs del cielo ma?ana temprano. Estn en el sur a primera luz, con Jpiter muy hacia la derecha de la Luna. Usted no puede perder de vista a Jpiter porque es ms brillante que cualquier otro punto de luz que se ve como una estrella en el cielo.    26 de mayo, 2008  Arturo, la estrella ms brillante de Bootes, el pastor, se encuentra alta en el cielo al caer la noche. Usted la puede encontrar al seguir el arco del mango de la Gran cacerola, alejndose de la cazo de la cacerola hasta que usted llegue a su primera estrella brillante: la amarilla-anaranjada Arturo.    27 de mayo, 2008  La Luna alcanza su ltimo cuarto a las 9:57 p.m., Hora Oficial Central (CDT). La luz solar ilumina a la mitad del hemisferio lunar que da cara a la Tierra, as que se ve como si alguien hubiera rebanado a la Luna por la mitad. La porcin iluminada disminuir hasta que sea nueva el 3 de junio.    28 de mayo, 2008  Telescopios peque?os revelan una anillo dbil de luz entre las dos estrellas brillantes que definen el ala oriental de Cygnus, el cisne. Llamado el Rizo de Cygnus, el es la remanente de una estrella que explot hace por lo menos 15,000 a?os. Se extiende por ms de 100 a?os luz.    29 de mayo, 2008  Un cmulo globular conocido como M13 pasa alto por encima de la cabeza esta noche. Se ve como un punto de luz dbil y borroso en la constelacin de Hrcules. Est a 25,000 a?os luz de distancia y contiene a cientos de miles de estrellas, compactadas en un volumen peque?o de espacio.    30 de mayo, 2008  Hrcules, el hombre fuerte, llena el cielo oriental esta noche. Es una gran constelacin que forma una especie de paralelogramo. Y es el hogar de dos brillantes cmulos globulares, los cuales son esferas muy compactas de cientos de miles de estrellas.    31 de mayo, 2008  Rasalhague, la estrella que representa la cabeza de Ofiuco, el cargador de serpientes, est en el este al caer la noche y asciende alto a travs del sur ms tarde. Es una estrella doble que est como a 47 a?os de distancia.|`|v5yAUp9gaa	Que romantica eres yo tambien lo soy.La noche estrellada tiene su encanto,he llorado mas cuando ha estado cerrara negra,como la tristeza sin estrllas y sin luna y he llorado no se cuando pero aqlgunas veces pero tambien en ese infinitud he pensado en alguien que nos espera.

A los 20    Aljese de las relaciones tormentosas o excesivamente posesivas. El amor no debe doler, como solemos creer a esta edad, mucho menos cuando tiene toda su energa a flor de piel y en vez de estar llorando debera estar descubriendo el mundo y disfrutando.los hombres estan experimentando en el sexo asi que lo mejor es tomarlo como experiencia    Su hombre ideal: Busque a un hombre intelectualmente estimulante, que comparta sus metas o la acompa?e a alcanzarlas; uno que entienda que ambos tienen toda una vida por delante y que deben vivirla sin afanes. Uno que no la absorba y respete sus espacios para crecer, para conocer, para descubrir todo ese mundo nuevo que abre de par en par cuando estamos en nuestros 20's.    A los 30    Aljese (huya si es preciso) del hombre que la critica o la acompleja;que la hace sentir mal con sus comentarios del que sintindose retado por usted y por sus logros, pretende volverle la vida a?icos sembrndole inseguridades en vez de amor.     Por muy fuerte e independiente que usted sea, no tiene sentido estar en una relacin donde el trabajo en equipo es nulo y el hombre intenta que usted lo mantenga cual ni?o desprotegido de mama . Aljese.    Su hombre ideal: Uno que est dispuesto a compartir sus triunfos y consolarla en sus momentos de tristeza. Uno al que le sobran la admiracin y las ganas de apoyarla en todos los proyectos en los que se embarque, sean profesionales o personales. Un hombre que la complemente.a nivel profesional Uno que si no le da, por lo menos que no le quite.    A los 40    Aljese de esos hombres que le apuesten muy poco a la sustancia y la experiencia. No vale la pena servirle de guardaespaldas a un hombre al que todava se le vayan los ojos tras la primera que pase,que le da por experimentar sus fantasias sexuales con usted ya sean trios,orgias y le llama la atencin desde su hija hasta su mejor amiga,alejese necesita un hombre que la haga disfrutar la plenitud de su mente y su cuerpo que la haga sentir deseada, admirada y estimulada.    Su Hombre ideal: Un buen compa?ero de vida. Uno que le brinde tranquilidad, seguridad y certezas. Uno que valore a la mujer maravillosa en la que se ha convertido. Un hombre seguro de s mismo que est dispuesto a entrar en esta nueva etapa de "descubrimiento" de pareja, donde pueden ver los triunfos o fracasos a nivel tanto material como personal en donde los gustos son ms selectivos y en donde ambos querrn experimentar nuevas cosas juntos,estas no se limitan nicamente al sexo. desde viajar y aprender un nuevo idioma, hasta practicar paracaidismo y juegos romnticos|`|3fLFPYT2aa	obvio que no. que acaso no es logico??|`|A2R67vD9aa	desde luego que no,amor es amar y compromiso es obligacin a una palabra dada o a una accin impuesta|`|X6G6Ln9Gaa	Claro que no ya que si te casas por amor es un deseo que tienes de hacerlo y si es por compromiso es por que de alguna forma sientes que le debes algo a esa persona y necesitas hacerlo, si no eres feliz con ese alguien mejor hablale claro si no los dos seran infelices para siempre|`|z6svsTK4aa	el amor te empuja a la persona por instinto un sentimiento tan profundo q sientes y t q t convence d q esa es la persona con la ke kieres compartir tu vida, el compromiso no t empuja, algo o alguien te empuja|`|WxBp5r2iaa	Yo creo que si amas vas estar con esa pareja hasta que la muerte o los hijos te separen... en otro caso como el matrimonio o compromiso acabas con una gorda 2 hijos fumadroga y una hija prostituta.      ese es mi punto de vista sobre las dos cosas|`|wFRas0G5aa	noooooooooooooooo nada q ver, ahora si te casas por compromiso y te separas meno te duele jua jua|`|zHRx6zI0aa	no es lo mismo  Por compromiso :   te pueden obligar o tambin si esa persona te ama y tu no lo amas a el, apuestas o estupideces como esa que llevan a que una relacin sea un total fracaso     Por Amor:  casarse por amor podramos decir que los dos han tomado una decisin utilizando la razn y el amor para dar el siguiente paso de sus vidas JUNTOS ^^,cuidarse ser honestos respetarse,sinceros, abra discusiones problemas pero obviamente si realmente se aman sabrn llevar los problemas y salir adelante JUNTOS ^^  cudate ^^|`|y8LcY9lRaa	Casarse por amor: cuando quieras.  Casarse por compromiso: nunca.|`|9SdH3nk1aa	casarse por amor es el mayor fidelidad con el corazn, que hay...    casarse por compromiso es la mayor infidelidad al corazn, que hay...|`|eV48tx4raa	No creo que sea lo mismo he escuchado a personas que se casaron por compromiso decir que se sienten secuestrados por su pareja.|`|2hPtfDZtaa	Basicamente si xD, al final te casas no?   La diferencia es que por compromiso te das cuenta antes que es el matrimonio al fin y al cabo no sirve de mucho y casarte por amor implica luego el compromiso de estar casada xD.    Saludos ^^

6ciaTh6yaa	Querida ma    Es fcil, coges la corbata, el lado ancho que se ve la colocas en tu cuello hacia la derecha a tres cuartos, si notas encontraras una costura que te marca la distancia    Luego,cruzas el lado largo y grueso sobre el delgado  en tu pecho    Atraviesa la corbata por el  lado grueso sobre el delgado  y tienes ya medio nudo, pasas por debajo el lado grueso hacia el otro lado por la parte trasera y vuelves a cruzar el lado grueso sobre el delgado, tienes ya un nudo casi completo.     El lado grueso  lo tendras de espalda, asi que lo pasas por delante para tapar los dos medios nudos que tienes, y luego la recuperas por detras hacia la quijada y  introduces el lado grueso en la tapa que  realisaste y "vuala", nudo de corbata hecho.

mPTLFcqVaa	Seguridad en uno mismo.      La seguridad en uno mismo es una vivencia o sentimiento que viene desde el propio interior. Nos ayuda a sentirnos bien y a tener confianza en los propios potenciales internos y en las posibilidades de una accin adecuada. Nace del sentimiento interno de Unidad, de una equilibrada autovaloracin y del entendimiento de que todo ser humano es rico en posibilidades, aunque muchas veces pueda errar y fracasar y aprender as de los errores y fracasos, rectificando por un lado y sobreponindose por otro. La seguridad es tambin humildad y aceptacin de uno mismo, con sus capacidades y limitaciones como ser humano.      La vanidad, el despotismo, la soberbia, el temperamento adusto y la arrogancia son signos claros de personas inseguras que tienen que parapetarse en estas actitudes para defender su personalidad. La persona que realmente es y se siente segura suele ser cordial, abierta, afectiva, distendida; no requiere de autodefensas narcisistas ni atrincheramientos psquicos de ningn orden. Cuando hay seguridad en uno mismo hay mayor disponibilidad para reponerse ante las adversidades y menos posibilidades de pesadumbre o abatimiento ante contrariedades o vicisitudes, porque uno dispone la fuerza y la luz en su interior. La seguridad en uno mismo es confianza en esa fuerza interior y s mismo para vivir espiritualmente.|`|0zjjri2zaa	saludossssss|`|qeKahUQKaa	?Cual es la pregunta?|`|t1qnw8ITaa	viajar al espacio exterior y resolver los conflictos cosmicos de donde parten, desde la tierra se pierde perspectiva.|`|6umHyZsSaa	en principio no s si ests muy bien mentalmente, podemos vencer muchas cosas si estamos bien, pero qu pasa si luchamos con otro que tambien est bien? no se neutralizara nuestro bienestar y la batalla sera ms azarosa?? los agujeros negros son el producto de la ignorancia emocional y mental que se imanta con el metal y pide ms y ms aunque acumular destruya el lugar. debemos partir siempre desde lo profundo y simple de nuestro interior, no esos abismos rebuscados, sino lo simple y claro, la verdad es algo muy sencillo pero mentirnos ha sido siempre una tentacin y una desgracia. no neutralicemos nada seamos sinceros nada ms.|`|6ciaTh6yaa	Bueno compleja las preguntas y algun conteido esoterico en ellas    - Si te encuentras bien emocionalmente, podras encarar adecuadamente cualquier tipo de problema "mounstro" como tu lo defines.  - Si, te encuentras emocionalmente completa y en buen estado, sueles tener la capacidad de mirar fuera de ti, tu entorno y las cosas que lo afectan, es decir que tendras la capacidad de colocarte en los zapatos ajenos, de manera de comprender que existen otros parametros, para observar la vida, que no son necesariamente los tuyos. "Empatia"  - Si, si tiene un adecuado desarrollo emocional, tendras la capacidad de frenar cualquier agresion externa hacia ti y valorarla en su real dimencion "agujeros negros"  - Si, normalmente el deseo de odio, venganza o envidia para tomar unos ejemplos significativos, tienenden a reflejar en ti  emociones negativas, si tienes una adecuada madurez emocional, no tendras la capacidad de sentir esas emociones dani?as. Es decir en tus palabras reflejaras hacia afuera todos aquellos estados mentales alterados que tratan de llegar hacia ti.  - El punto de partida, se encuentra en tu interior, conocete a ti, conoce tus debilidades y flaquezas, quierete mucho, considerate una persona unica y valioza, amate por sobre todas las cosas, y recien estaras en condiciones de amar a  tus congeneres.  - Mira las alteraciones emocionales, suelen ser  desiquilibrantes, en el orden practico y/o cosmico, la respuesta a ello, se encuentra en tu fuerza interior.

mPTLFcqVaa	El mito de Ssifo es un extenso ensayo de Albert Camus, originalmente publicado en francs en 1942 como Le Mythe de Sisyphe. El ensayo se abre con la siguiente cita de Pndaro:    No te afanes, alma ma, por una vida inmortal, sino que apura el recurso hacedero.   El ttulo del ensayo proviene de un atribulado personaje de la mitologa griega. En l, Camus discute la cuestin del suicidio y el valor de la vida, presentando el mito de Ssifo como metfora del esfuerzo intil e incesante del hombre moderno, que consume su vida en fbricas y oficinas srdidas y deshumanizadas.    De esta forma plantea la filosofa del absurdo, que mantiene que nuestras vidas son insignificantes y no tienen ms valor que el de lo que creamos. Siendo el mundo tan ftil, Camus pregunta, ?qu alternativa hay al suicidio? El ensayo se inicia: No hay sino un problema filosfico realmente serio: el suicidio.    Ssifo, dentro de la mitologa griega, como Prometeo, hizo enfadar a los dioses por su extraordinaria astucia. Como castigo, fue condenado a perder la vista y empujar perpetuamente un pe?asco gigante monta?a arriba hasta la cima, slo para que volviese a caer rodando hasta el valle, y as indefinidamente.    Camus desarrolla la idea del "hombre absurdo", o con una "sensibilidad absurda". Es aqul que se muestra perpetuamente consciente de la completa inutilidad de su vida. sta, afirma, es la nica alternativa aceptable al injustificable salto de fe que constituye la base de todas las religiones (e incluso del existencialismo, que por tanto Camus no aceptaba completamente). Aprovechndose de numerosas fuentes filosficas y literarias, y particularmente de Dostoievski, Camus describe el progreso histrico de la conciencia del absurdo y concluye que Ssifo es el hroe absurdo definitivo.    En su ensayo, Camus afirma que Ssifo experimenta la libertad durante un breve instante, cuando ha terminado de empujar el pe?asco y an no tiene que comenzar de nuevo abajo. En ese punto, Camus senta que Ssifo, a pesar de ser ciego, saba que las vistas del paisaje estaban ah y deba haberlo encontrado edificante: "Uno debe imaginar feliz a Ssifo", declara, por lo que aparentemente lo salva de su destino suicida.    La obra se cierra con un apndice sobre la obra de Franz Kafka, interpretada finalmente de manera similar, en trminos de un esteticismo, a su modo, esperanzador.|`|wkCD35tuaa	Que? jaja|`|fGG1v0YPaa	JA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! tens una linda locura,amiga.un beso.|`|0zjjri2zaa	saludos      me encantan tus preguntas siempre me hacen sentir ue no soy tan inteligente|`|VaTBt9X8aa	Suben A Gastar y desgastarse...

Sigue a la proclamacin de la princesa Turandot de que nadie debe dormir hasta hallar el nombre del prncipe desconocido, Calf, quien ha lanzado el desafo de que si su nombre no es descubierto, la fra Princesa Turandot se casar con l. Calf canta, indicando su certeza de que sus esfuerzos por descubrir su nombre sern en vano.    Era la cancin por excelencia del tenor italiano Luciano Pavarotti. Nessun Dorma fue la cancin que l cant en su ltima actuacin, el final de la Ceremonia de Apertura de los Juegos Olmpicos de Turn 2006, donde recibi la mayor y ms larga ovacin de la noche.    El aria lleg a la cultura popular despus de que la BBC la usara para su cobertura de la Copa Mundial de Ftbol de 1990 en Italia. A consecuencia, alcanz el nmero 2 de la lista de singles en el Reino Unido, el mejor puesto que haya nunca conseguido una grabacin clsica.    Otra interesante interpretacin de esta celebrrima aria la realiza el tenor italiano Franco Corelli, cuyo Calaf es uno de los ms crebles y completos de cuantos han sido encarnados.       Letra  [editar]Il principe ignoto   Nessun dorma! Nessun dorma!   Tu pure, o Principessa,   Nella tua fredda stanza   Guardi le stelle   Che tremano d'amore e di speranza.   Ma il mio mistero  chiuso in me,   Il nome mio nessun sapr!   Solo quando la luce splender,   (Puccini:No,no,Sulla tua bocca lo dir)   Sulla tua bocca lo dir fremente!...   (Puccini: Quando la luce splender!)   Ed il mio bacio scioglier il silenzio   Che ti fa mia!...   Voci di donne   Il nome suo nessun sapr...   E noi dovremo, ahim, morir, morir!...

Lo importante es que no se conflictuen tanto con los invitados, si se van a casar es porque se aman y quieren compartir el resto de sus vidas el uno con el otro. Entonces ?para qu empiezan su matrimonio con conflictos?      Adems, si se supone que se van a casar por amor, los ms importantes invitados a la boda, son ustedes 2 ?para qu quieren que haya tanta gente en su boda? Yo creo que va a estar quien tiene que estar.

Por otro lado, si las retenciones realmente se utilizaran para asistencia social - federal - y no como caja chica de la presidenta para "adornar" a sus gobernadores  aliados... Igualmente no creo en el fantasma golpista que quiere hacer creer el gobierno ni que los ruralistas sean tan solidarios y sacrificados (los hay).|`|6fe5712c40ebff439036dc4c6f8e46c7aa	TE HABLAN CAMPO!!!

Or assume that there might be a kitty in your wall and go rescue it.
y84sWg6Aaa	I agree with you.    Really, all they talk about is "jail" and "the ghetto" and "drugs" and "guns"  from what I've heard.    I say there is no point in it.|`|0b69f105ff4b59337ac981d520e9f6f4aa	Omg..how OLD are you, 10??    At *least* offer valid *reasons* besides "It's so horrible".    You obvious have only heard the crap on MTV & BET...|`|00aa98e47f4b035d1c4676e5970e1774aa	country is pretty good, and also pop|`|71fefa997dc395cc8a3d3cf5068e89ecaa	What is the point? For some rappers it is about self expression. Sadly however  the point increasingly has been to make record companies rich, to the detriment of the genre, in other words it has the same 'point'  as all crappy music.  Nevertheless, not all rap is crap, just like not all pop music is as bad as Blink 182 or Britney Spears etc...  You have to keep your ears and your mind open or you will miss a lot of good things in life|`|94c5fa96eb8ad202da9d7fdaaeabc9e1aa	some people do like it. i am not a huge fan but i love rock. people have their different opinions on music even though i disagree with some of them!!|`|gUcCVkSMaa	Don't like all the messages but I can't put down the whole genre. Its urban poetry with a beat. Some of it will be bad and some will have lyrical genius|`|AA10612215	There is some rap I like, and some I don't.  How can you generalize about any type of music being "horrible" without offering any reasons to back it up?  I also like pop, rock and the occasional country song.|`|b08f23f64cf67ed7e34f8ed0781dfd16aa	Yea.. it really is awful.  Honestly, I think I liked the rap back like in 90's or more of the early days, it was more exciting and more creative.  I like Will Smith kind of rap if that's considered to be rap,  but yea seriously.. I dont like it at all.  Very few like Eminem and that's about it.|`|mhQdghXqaa	i know! i wish it makes sense like when it 1st started in the early 90s....|`|Zgty5MULaa	Poetry gone terribly wrong.|`|e34fa0a98e59cba24a3a389ff55bb886aa	o think its okay. i listen to everything. but i especially like rock and r&b|`|eda5987b385a20e41560dd42844d7baaaa	Isn't wonderful that there are so many forms of music and expression. Although I do not listen to rap, it is a valid art form. I am pretty ecclectic when it comes to music so I listen to bit of this and that. :)|`|4vdINuv6aa	Personally, I love rap music. It's the only thing I listen too.    It's just your personal thoughts. I absolutely love it. And so does my boyfriend.|`|cS4zSBGWaa	yeah recently it's got crap but i still like listening to the old ones form the the 80's and 90's especially rappers like easy e, Dr dre, eminem's old ones, DMX Bone thugs n harmony . Listen to the words and you'll change ur mind

g4APbW4Naa	Season 3 just started airing in the U.S.  They aired 2 episodes this past Monday.  I won't spoil it by saying what happened - but you can see an episode recap here:    http://www.tv.com/heroes/show/17552/epis...    Season 2 dragged quite a bit, and then got cut short by the writer's strike.  Supposedly those last few episodes were going to be good, but then all that plot goodness just got pushed into Season 3.|`|AA10198825	You can skip season 2 because it was not that great. Season 3 is the best season I've seen so far. You can catch up with episodes of Heroes @ http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/

I think they cast everyone great.     They need to realize this movie wasn't made in mind for them, everyone imagined the cast differently, but Stephanie Meyer approved and liked the cast, and she wrote the book, not them.  They should also get over that "they're not beautiful enough".  They're only human. I would like to see said people do better.
EVN8mM18aa	I think weezy deserves respect because he has been able to do what not many rappers have done: Stand the test of time. Weezy has been rapping since he was around 14. And for him to be in the game 7 or 8 years already and still be talked about as much as he has is quite commendable. Also, he just sold over 1 million copies of the carter iii in the first week. Something that once again has not been done in a quite some years. As for 2 pac, well, we cannot say for sure that he would have stood the test of time as lil wayne has. I know people would say yes for sure he would have, but to know for a FACT is not humanly possible. Everything else is just speculation and opinions. Albeit strong opinions.

UddXhPyxaa	Wow very tricky....  Chocolate is so scrumptuous and soothing,  But then again so is sex....  I can't believe I'm gonna say this ( I live for chocolate) but I can't live without sex...   I choose a year without CHocolate!!|`|9FQlog25aa	Totally, a year without sex.  People can discipline themselves to live without it all their lives, and abstaining from sex does NOT require abstaining from physical contact: hugs, hand-holding, running your fingers through someone's hair, etc.  You can get lots of physical affection even in an innocent way from a child sitting in your lap, totally non-sexual.    Chocolate, however, is addictive!  (After posting, I noticed someone said it isn't.  Well, it is for me.)  Sex = endorphins; Chocolate = endorphins + anti-oxidants    Interpersonal-relationship-wise, sex lasts about, what, 10 minutes (based on ref below, plus basic middle school science texts), but a quarter pound of Godiva chocolates (or Hershey's Special Dark; I'm not a choco-snob) will last many, many, lip-smacking hours.  All you do afterward is throw away the wrappers; none of this, "Oh, you were so great, baby," stuff.  ;-)    And you can go to a party and go home quite content to be alone, but to say "No,thank you," to all those yummy treats staring you in the face ... yep, keep the choccers and nix the boom-boom.|`|f6zcRQ2Baa	Well, since I'm fourteen.

You can have chocolate, and not get pregnant.  It's also good for you, lots of fiber.    You can get addicted to sex, chocolate is yum but you can't  get addicted.    If you gain weight from chocolate you can loose it, but when your pregnant you can't hide the fact that you are

You are much needed in this to defeat the petas. there's also either one of many or there is many of the same person. Either way, you're bound to get a workout with the violation button!|`|85JJfTgBaa	yeah, whatever|`|b00fde0a47400e66a8777af1fca27675aa	sorry but i think sometimes you report people for the wrong reasons. For example the sex change question:    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...        that was completely unnecesary... It was not innapropriate at all. Sex means as in gender. It was not violating anything.      I am just expressing my opinion so dont report me for this.

80c36e6c54918c3e2db0cebe6120d707aa	My sister and her husband set me up on a blind date with a guy from his job. When I got to their house the guy was there, but he didnt have a car. And he was ugly as hell. So all of us went on a double date, we went to AppleBee's and ate. We had to go on my car, and the whole way there, this guy was downing Budweisers. When we got to the restaurant, he ordered his food, ate a few bites, put $20 on the table, and said he would wait outside til we were done. I guess he drank too much and was feeling a little woozy. Needless to say $20 didnt cover both his and my meal. I didnt put any money in towards it, my sisters husband covered the rest of it.  I told them I wanted to go home. So we went back to their house and went inside. The guy sat down on the couch and after about 5 minutes, fell asleep. I went into the other room to tell my sister I was leaving, and this trick had the nerve to ask me to take him home so they wouldnt have to go out. I said hell no. So she took my keys from me, and wouldnt give them back. Precious time was being wasted, as he could wake up any minute. We fought over the keys for about 30 minutes, until I finally got them back from her. I left, and I didn't even speak to her for a few weeks.    Although it was SO not funny at the time, I can now look back on it and laugh my @$$ off.

hnItHP6yaa	Hairspray is kid friendly, although, there is a few parts you should be aware about.  There are a few phrases with cuss words in them, but they are mild words, damn, kiss my a**.  I think that's the worst of them.  There is also some brief teenage smoking, its only shown for less then 10 seconds.  But other than that, I think a younger kid would like the movie.  The songs are good and the storyline, if they are old enough to understand is great!|`|nxJR09YUaa	well yah. anything with zac efron and amanda bynes im sure is a-okay.|`|Z2Y3kcPsaa	It looks pretty kid-friendly, if your kid likes musicals and a lot of singing.

En la pelcula de Toy story el padre era un borracho que unos das antes de la filmacion lo metieron preso por manejar vajo la influencia del alcohol.    En Bugs Life (Bichos) La Mama hormiga por ser reina mando ejecutar al marido por haberle sido infiel.    En El Rey Len la verdadera razn del asesinato de Mufasa se debi a una deuda entre narcotraficantes, despus de su muerte la esposa descubri que el tambin era el padre de Nala pero nunca tuvo el valor de decirselo a Simba.    En la de Dumbo, la mama fue de la vida fcil a?os atrs y nunca supo quien era el verdadero padre de la criatura orejona aunque siempre sospecho de Ral Velasco.    En la Bella y la Bestia el papa golpeaba mucho a la mama asta que esta se canso y lo dejo por el papa de Ariel de la sirenita.

nJImJXtjaa	Michael Anthony isn't a Van Halen...Wolfgang is.  Plus losing a lead singer is alot different then losing a bass player.  I loved Van Halen with and without Diamond Dave and I'll love them with or without Michael Anthony.|`|f81a7b98bad743d7327e2a187e3d7427aa	Yes indeed it is... can't wait.  Reunion means getting back out there and touring, all original players is a technicality.  The older we get the less likely all the same band members will be in attendance due to deaths and loyalties to a new band.  Michael is happy being with Sammy Hagar, May pose a kind of conflict of interest. I'm sure they tried that first. Wolfgang is going to be great. That will be as close as we can expect to get to the real Van Halen and should prove to be exceptional.    Did you see The Who this past year with Ringo's kid, it was great. not all the same players but just as good a game. It kicked butt.|`|4800f15d14b417434b7be1674b52e989aa	Eddie Van Halen's son, Wolfgang, will be filling in at bass.

Papoose)    [Papoose:]  Deep Side, y'all crazy for this one!  Somebody 'bout to have a baby to this song  I'm on tracks that they pay me to get on  I sit back, but the ladies they sip   Don Perrion,   and I turn my cellie on  Wifey said she's got something sexy on  She told me hurry up, I said I'm already gone  But I ain't leave, I was gettin' my tele on.    [Verse 1: Deep Side]  Oh girl don't you see I'm on a mission  Tryna see the a**  assumin' the position  Baby I'm a drive, know you wanna ride  Just relax and ur ready for a good time  When ur in my bedroom just get naked  Girl, them clothes is outta fashion  Let me release ya tension, lickin' on ya neck n  Now i got ya ready for some action  Now she standin' over top of me  Dancin' all freaky, talkin' bout this  What you wanna see  More to secret to my Vicky's  Hopin' that she show me  Now ya see I'm gettin' ho**y so...    [Chorus:]  Let's make love (Let's make love)  Let's make love, right now  Till the sweat starts pourin'  Till when, till six in the mornin'  Let's make love (Let's make love)  Let's make love, right now  Keep givin' you more n  Till when, till six in the mornin'    [Verse 2: Deep Side]  36 DD, not to mention that she five foot three  Sayin' BOO, what ya got for me  I cant wait to put ya *** to sleep  I can hear the way ya breathin'  Ya wanna get closer  Girl the night aint over  I believe that ya get what ya work for  So I'm a gonna turn ya out till ya want more  You be wrappin' ya legs around me  Squeezin my body tightly  Ya wont be able to stop the shakin'  All because this love we're makin'    [Chorus:]  Let's make love (Let's make love)  Let's make love, right now  Till the sweat starts pourin'  Till when, till six in the mornin'  Let's make love (Let's make love)  Let's make love, right now  Keep givin' you more n  Till when, till six in the mornin'    [Bridge:]  Don't waste time  All the love that you ask for  Can start tonight  Girl i can be all that you ever dream  And make you fall right back in love with me  (Girl ya know what it is so baby can I live)    [Papoose:]  Whats the difference between having sex and making love?  When you have sex, you give to em like a thug  But when you make love - you do it with a passion  which one you prefer?   That's what I'm asking  My sex drive make your bootie grow  I got a hard drive like the ones they use in the studio  When its over, pull you a cold glass of soda  Signing off, Papoose, The Casanova.    [Chorus:]  Let's make love (Let's make love)  Let's make love, right now  Till the sweat starts pourin'  Till when, till six in the mornin'  Let's make love (Let's make love)  Let's make love, right now  Keep givin' you more n  Till when, till six in the mornin'|`|enDggi6Haa	nope!|`|4uiZ0SaAaa	R.

Farid (entrain dappuyer sur un bouton vert) : de quoi ce bouton Monsieur ?  Le chauffeur (en criant): noooooooooooooooooooooooon    La voiture drape de la route et tombe dans un arbre du foret, heureusement tous air bags actifs. Et les lves sortent lun aprs lautre de la limozine qui est dans un tat catastrophique.    Le chauffeur regarde Farid avec les larmes dans les yeux    Le chauffeur : 3lache ? 3lache ? tu veux me tuer ?  Farid : Cest pas ?a, je veux juste  Hamid (assis sur une pierre avec une cigarette dans la main) : heusement, la derniere fois jai ramen Zatla avec moi.  Ahmed : Kayne elhalouf hna ?

52665826a79f2bf4f4698963ec3f23a3aa	No creo que sean una mala influencia, las peliculas son solo un entretenimiento, yo he visto peliculas de Hollywood toda my vida y no e matado a nadie ni tengo orgias con mis amigas, y si las peliculas son una mala influecia lo mismo se puede decir de la musica, y no solo las yankees, tambien de las peliculas y la musica latinoamericana (y sobre todo las espa?olas)|`|19f441b798977cd792a78ed0975b4d15aa	Si una pelicula logra influir negativamente sobre una persona, el problema no es la pelicula: es la persona.    Cada uno trae consigo un plus de locura, si se tiene una psiquis lo suficientemente vulnerable como para que una pelicula te haga saltar la termica...entonces urgente al psiquiatra.    Se me dira que los ni?os son vulnerables: es cierto.    Pero para eso existe la calificacion previa que se le da a las peliculas que indica a partir de que edad es recomendable que la vean.    Hacer que un ni?o de 5 a?os vea La Masacre de Texas o una pelicula pornografica me parece descabellado. Son peliculas para adultos...    En resumen: el arte influye sobre la gente, pero de manera diferente.  Cuando yo vi , por ejemplo; Kill Bill o Contracara, no sali como una loca a comprarme una Katana o a matar gente con una 9 milimetros ?me explico?    Si una pelicula te influye tan negativamente, esta mal del coco...anda al medico. Las peliculas no tienen nada que ver.    saludos|`|164e8eb2df49479a8bca1a9cdc0400a6aa	Sabes hay buen cine independiente norteamericano, pero lo comercial en s (la mayora de Hollywood) te muestran la visin que tiene el promedio estadounidense por ejemplo: los personajes saben que esta bien y que esta mal, el bien lucha contra el mal y gana siempre, todo lo que existe es EEUU, hay un Dios, los problemas se solucionan en forma mgica. En pocas palabras tal como deca una antigua cancin:    "The Sun Always Shines on TV"    pero la vida es siempre mucho ms complicada    Personalmente prefiero el cine francs, he visto pelculas "Deslumbrantes".    un Beso y una Flor para Ti y para Todos y mira cine francs, gracias a el Yo he aprendido a amar el Cine.|`|M1dT7om4aa	Lo dudo,ya que por lo que he visto,las peliculas violentas,videjuegos o cualquier otro tipo de entretenimiento como esto no causa ningun danio,por que japon si tiene las peliculas mas violentas y videojuegos mas violentos y sangrientos del mundo,los asesinatos con armas de fuego han sido minimos,las estadisticas dicen que por lo menos pasan 13 de estos asesinatos al anio,mientras que en Estados unidos hay 11,500.Asi que no se puede culpar a la publicidad ni a la musica.    Saludos|`|a46ab4664b553bc9f67db1e6360d9b26aa	Yo creo que como en todo. Hay bueno y malo. No podemos satanizar a Hollywood cuando ha hecho pelculas excelentes. Lo importante es verlas como son: Pelculas (ciencia ficcin). Puedes tambin clavarte y pensar que el estereotipo yankee es lo pero que puede haber en este mundo, pero hay estereotipos que son peores (en todo el mundo, eh)  El problema no est en las pelculas, la cuestin est en los valores bien cimentados que tengamos|`|OdnGwvyAaa	Esta claro a un ni?o de cierta edad no se le deberian dejar ver ciertas peliculas, a no ser que la madre o padre piense que esta preparado mentalmente para verlas y asimilar que es una ficcion y no es real. Una pelicula sola no causa da?o los que causan da?o son las personas. si te fijas a lo largo de la historia y antes de que existiera el cine ya habia violencia en el mundo, la violencia forma parte de la vida del ser humano, las peliculas de accion reflejan esa vida de una manera exagerada no es una realidad, pero hay gente que no puede ver la diferencia entre realidad y ficcion y se toman las peliculas como una guia. Como ya dijo alguien por ahi en japon hacen peliculas violentas y la gente las ve normalmente sin que les cause ningun da?o.   En conclusion El cine no es el que causa la violencia si no las personas.|`|gd7E8ylaaa	Para los ni?os recomiendo Kill Bill Vol.1 y 2|`|g8QDS2SGaa	Creo que si pueden ser una mala influencia para un ni?o, cuando la pelicula que ve no es apropiada para su edad, obviamente, y del la industria cinematogrfica que sea, incluso, creo que en otros paises las narraciones son mucho mas crudas, como en America Latina. Pero Hollywood genera muchas peliculas especiales para chicos, talvez la industria que mas peliculas infantiles desarrolla. Estas entretenidas, algunas con mensajes positivos, que son muy apropiadas.    Ahora, Hollywood tiene una percepcion del mundo y de la vida bastante particular y taxativa sobre quienes son los buenos y los malos, lo correcto e incorrecto, que de alguna manera puede distorsionar el pensamiento de los chicos.

No one but her Brother and Melinda knew she died until the last few seconds when melinda talked to her for the first time on the series. That was when Andrea and the audience/fans found out she died. Romano tried to cross her over to the dark side which would gurantee her a stay on earth. But Melinda was able to convince her in the 2nd season to cross over into the light. I don't think anyone still knows why her character was killed off. The producers, writers, J-Love, or even Aisha won't say/"don't know". :D

LvwlzWq1aa	"Quantum of Solace" is a small degree of comfort that can exist between two people emotionally in a relationship. The Governor character in the Ian Fleming short story of the same name defines it as "... a precise figure defining the comfort, humanity and fellow feeling required between two people for love to survive. If the quantum of solace is nil, then love is dead."    The title is taken from Fleming's short story of the same name in the book "For Your Eyes Only". This was the first collection of Fleming James Bond short stories and was first published on April 11, 1960. The collection was subtitled "Five Secret Occasions in the life of James Bond" and was the 8th James Bond book. It also included the short stories "The Hildebrand Rarity", "From A View To A Kill", "Risico" and "For Your Eyes Only".|`|jInqXio1aa	It means they havent a clue what to call it!

2wDJmluOaa	para mi no es perder el tiempo sino pasarlo con una actividad especifica que te agrada, no forzozamente aprendemos algo, pero nos comunicamos aunque no nos conozcamos y eso nos enriquece como personas   ademas muchas veces te permite desahogar lo que sientes y compartirlo con alguien, saber la opinion de las personas, sus sentimientos, sus ideas y sus conocimientos  creo que a quienes nos gusta YR estamos invirtiendo nuestro tiempo en una forma particular de comunicacion con una comunidad, es algo que yo disfruto mucho    : )|`|rGGgnBiQaa	Depende a qu categora se recurra.

bndE2CXoaa	Sencillo.  Sea que tienes Yahoo o Google (yo tengo ambos), en el espacio de busqueda escribes en espaniol o ingles si conoces el idioma, cualquiera de estas cosas:  (Espaniol)  Emisoras de Radio en Internet. . . o Radio en Linea... o Estaciones de Radio Mundo.  (Ingles) Radio On Line Worldwide. . . o  Internet Radio Stations.  En la pantalla te pone un listado de enlaces (links) que con cliquear te dirige a lo que quieras, del pais que quieras, y generalmente de gratis.  Si quieres estaciones de radio de USA, puedes hacerlo en espaniol escribiendo "estaciones de radio de eua" o "estaciones de radio en linea de usa".  Si lo quieres en ingles, pues "United States Radio Stations On Line" o "Internet Radio from the United States".  Te pone en pantalla un alto numero de enlaces y bastara con clickear y seguir los pasos.  Es sencillisimo.  Yo vivo en Nueva Jersey y oigo radio de Espania, Puerto RIco, Argentina, Africa, Europa Oriental, Mediato Oriente.  Realmente puedes oir radio de donde desees.  Hay muchas estaciones de Gran Bretania (BBC WORLD SERVICE, o BBC RADIO), de EUA, de cuanto lugar puedes imaginar.  Si quieres un link que te permite musica por su genero (genre), te recomiendo  www.surfmusik.com.  Se origina en Alemania y es genial.  Pero tambien tienes "TOWER RADIO.COM", que origina en EUA.  Es super eficiente.  Bueno. . . no deseo cansarte demasiado.  Suerte.

Heck, my ex had been with more and pregnant so it not bad considering that    MO|`|WgSSu8Ddaa	Depends on what 'been with' means.  My guess is that it's bad for her, but great for the guys (that is until they all discover they have some sexually transmitted disease).|`|frjSBxzBaa	I am of the nature why is it bad if its okay for a male to do that seriously the double standard thing sucks       and yes i have a daughter and I would be okay with it but I would be accepting if she told me rather know than not know at all |`|mEcONtvQaa	I wonder how the 4 guys would answer this...  :)|`|iPz9dVubaa	Nah    SteveC|`|85JJfTgBaa	idk....not really|`|kgBb2MhBaa	hooray - well as long as it was what she wanted and no child molesters were involved if her partners were of the same age i see no problem  i just hope it wasn't to adults in which case call the cops ASAP   |`|rS6rAJHXaa	You think this is the worst sh*t they show on this channel?|`|dCiscccKaa	Oh her asss would be so locked up.

They damn sure don't play music anymore...|`|tJA5cbqfaa	no cuz these days lots of girls do stuff like that. lol.|`|ruNgs1V0aa	was that girl you?|`|kxnhE1L3aa	Not really.

f6zcRQ2Baa	Not yet. Obama is not yet the president. The transition has not taken place. But change IS coming.    I'm curious and excited to see what will he do when he steps into the White House. Will he keep his promises and end the war in Iraq? Will he do better in handling the economic crisis? I guess we'll just have to wait to find out. (:|`|ocSGMvb6aa	I can't really call it I guess we'll have to stick around and see hopefully alot of change will come out of Obama being president!!|`|nT7eoF66aa	It really depends on who's sitting on the supreme court and in congress/senate.    |`|jwwsAzYFaa	Im not a political person either, so the answer is Yes:|`|kwwq3AIyaa	Well of course everything will change.    The line between black and white people is slowly fading.  Don't you understand what this means? A black man ruling the United States of America will change the whole world for the good.  Everything will change.  I'm not sure how, but it will.    Barack Obama is going to save America.|`|Yku6t8ulaa	Change will come, But it won't be the change America bargained for!|`|4472d6c8b8a41746c6129264601312c7aa	I hope he'll keep his word on the removing the troops from Iraq. We'll see. I think he'll be a positive change. Except his opposition to gay marriage is bullsh*t|`|f6e717954d47e3850c47b18f045c5ae9aa	I am personally for it... I think he will bring us together as One Nation. One People. As it should be. Race is not a factor, nor should it be. |`|55FJ1nMHaa	I'm not a supporter of his, but i'm doing my best to give him the benefit of the doubt and hope he will do what's best for the country.|`|daf31a0f11d6dd2ff61a771f182635ddaa	Yes, change has really come.  You will pay more taxes.  The welfare rolls will increase.  Politicians will be spending money like they have it.  The government will take firearms from the people, as they will fear them.  The military will be brought home and used against the revolution in the streets.
NogbbqaLaa	lol I read that this morning and its hilarious, especially...    "Rarely is the questioned asked: Is our children learning?"|`|2cCme5lgaa	Idk|`|ZdO4aYR1aa	All the time. |`|4472d6c8b8a41746c6129264601312c7aa	That's not a word.|`|AaAe4ltmaa	yes, i have!|`|56216275babe93f0f69ad2124d3724deaa	yes when I told the person pulling my hair to stop, for which she promptly received a bloody nose. but I was only six at the time.|`|AA10860939	Unfortunately yes I have, and YES I am, still.

That was one of  the most hilarious things that I have ever read. My personal favorite was:     7. "There's an old saying in Tennessee - I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee - that says, fool me once, shame on - shame on you. Fool me - you can't get fooled again." - Sept. 17, 2002      Ummmmm............ not quite Mr. Bush. lol.|`|J3EMazKaaa	no|`|YgRb598naa	hahahaha thanks!|`|1kd33vOaaa	This is a double negative.|`|FC0CPzv3aa	always..u learn to use it to your advantage :P|`|sxZaNu7Maa	i think bush should get his own show he is one of the funniest men in the U.S.A|`|RjeIQybPaa	LOL!!! Thanks, that is great, I love it! But I don't think he was misunderstood, he really is that intelligent!!    But for me, I don't think I have ever been understood!|`|wmBK9uASaa	More times than I can count|`|CUMdhfKzaa	Misunderestimated.  LOL.    Bush said a lot of funny things.    It's funny how people say that Obama doesn't have experience, yet somehow Bush was allowed to roll right into office being as stupid as he is, then privileged son of a former president.|`|AA11601031	Yes,  People assume I voted for W when, in fact, I voted for his opponents no less than 4 times.  I guess I'm just too edumicated to vote for W.|`|ryEiHFOnaa	yeah...|`|hNCiw6Laaa	Without reading the link...ALL THE TIME BUD...|`|nOFvdF9yaa	Yes, once, so far I remember at this age and hundreds of time that I can't remember! Well, that was my child hood, when I thought myself as an expert but my seniors 'underestimated' me which was 'mis-underestimated' term to me :-)  But once, when I was so popular & dependable to the local businessmen, I was been mis-underestimated by a local govt officer! 10 or 12 years later he was retired & joined a private company who once needed me! That ex-govt guy then "overestimated" me!

mPGLegswaa	It happens more than you think. However, if you pay using paypal you will be refunded any loss that you may incur. The frustration of waiting and looking for the arrival of your purchase will remain though. Last August I bought a cellphone from some creep in Seattle. Apparently he had one to sell but sold it four times leaving three of us to file a dispute and to wait out the process for the refund. I assume that he was banned from ebay and is now doing his ebay crimes using a different name.|`|IizPFrELaa	I've never had any issues with eBay!    Thinking its a rare occurance.|`|89FgPZ9Waa	it's safe.|`|kfySwy8baa	i have only bought one thing off ebay and it was a good experience.|`|6014e877df433a9c4aa2133e5b670a4faa	I wanted a hotdoger off ebay and had to buy three to get one good one! |`|RqpSMJGuaa	It's safe.  Always key off the feedback rating of the seller. If it is 99% or better, I would not worry.  With regard to your $15 card, just email the seller and advise him/her that you haven't received it. Also ask when it was mailed.     Believe me, scamsters don't waste their time on 'nickel and dime' items. They would much rather 'kill elephants (expensive items), not mice." It's much more profitable and time efficient.  |`|4472d6c8b8a41746c6129264601312c7aa	That sucks. I've only had good experiences. But you can give bad feedback so that person can be kicked off of ebay.|`|G0wGbdENaa	its safe if you have common sense|`|mMPZuR7taa	I only buy from sellers with lots of positive feedback. I've never bought from a relatively new seller before.|`|5htWDVDNaa	its not safe.  it is so easty to get ripped off.|`|gH67ebMJaa	I have no such experience of  ebay|`|sYRBS6cTaa	Never had issues either. Look at their feedback score before buying from them. I usually buy from people who have a 97-100% feedback score.|`|7178e20a3678c4210fe9d3bc2e2ab936aa	Did you check out the rating of your seller?  See how many items he has sold in the past and what his rating is.  Also, you can report that you never received the item and eBay will work with you to either get your item or get your money back.    I've bought several things off of eBay and have never had a bad experience.  It does depend on the seller. Just make sure you do a little research on the seller to see what his rating is.|`|AA11114071	I've bought like 10 - 15 times in 2 years and never had a problem. Where are you purchasing from? I bought something from China once and it took a whole month to receive it. E-mail E-bay and they'll help you out or if you paid by Paypal e-mail them. One time a lady I bought from kept insisting the bank hadn't cleared the payment through Paypal and my bank was saying that it did so Paypal interveened and she apologized in the end.

WbRuTjmFaa	I would go to a clinic and get checked out and the assault on record.  You agreed yes, but if he was in fact an officer of the law he was WAY out of line.   You also need the morning after pill as you DO NOT want to be pregnant with his ......and it could happen|`|AA11280073	Let's see. You violated the conditions of your parole and you got drunk. Then you agreed to have sex in return for a favor. So whose fault is all of that? You have no one to blame but yourself. You need to get serious help for your alcoholism and your lack of morals. |`|4472d6c8b8a41746c6129264601312c7aa	Uhm, no. I'd never ever gone with him but he shouldn't have treated you that way (and that's an understatement because what I mean is they should cut off his balls and boil them).|`|3MB1Wsdaaa	No never happened to me-you sound as though you have a lot of growing and learning left to do. You don't fix a problem by creating a new one and perhaps once you get yourself in trouble you should follow the terms until you're out of trouble. Sounds like you're your own worst enemy.|`|41wB3udyaa	no, and no. if i were you i'd report him for abusing his position|`|SAQZIh13aa	 No , I would rather do time, than gratify a man in this way.|`|AA11841749	No, that has never happened to me.  I'd rather get 90 days in jail than be tore up by a filthy stranger.  I'm sorry that happened to you though.  |`|ZwgVLd5zaa	sad deal, but it will be even worse when he forgets about the whole thing and you go to jail anyway.

Old ladies are notoriously grumpy - low in oestrogen and high in attitude.|`|lEjYhwxkaa	ignore him.|`|oIIiMY5Zaa	Tell the teacher|`|ZgymstO6aa	This what you do no matter what people tell you. My brother taught me this and it worked. When you start in a new grade or school you want to start a fight with the biggest kid you can take down or the kid that picks on you first. I was 3 months into 6th grade this kid thought he could push me around i punched him in his face and started whooping his ***. Everyone saw what i did to him no one messed with me they all respected me. Make that first example when you young like i did never had to fight again till high school. II never ever got picked on.|`|XoOanmdraa	just kick his ***...it only takes one time. u might get beaten up but he will never think of picking on u again|`|ooD4zTzVaa	Just smile|`|4472d6c8b8a41746c6129264601312c7aa	Kick his punky ***!!|`|Kno1eWE1aa	Punch him in the face as hard as you can, and then when he's on the ground jump on him and beat his face in.|`|zHs8Cd6caa	challenge him to a rap battle|`|AqHWkhqcaa	knee him in the bollocks !|`|Bp0Cajfhaa	Ignore him. |`|4ec2d3273bd4436df6019b7f0aa76597aa	pull his hair and punch him in the stomach|`|QtqNXbIMaa	tell his mommy and daddy lol|`|HlxOtYMCaa	Just tell him to get the **** away,,,wait is he taller than  you??|`|o5pD40Ydaa	you need to be very loud and affirmative to this idiot. Get up, and yell in his face, loud as you can, but controlled, to leave you alone, and stop messing with you. If he gets in your face even closer, or says something smart back, then do something drastic, it might get you in trouble, but it will be worth it imo. Spit directly in his face, showing him the least respect almost possible, and walk away. If the teachers do not intervene, then you need to talk to your parents, and have them go see the principle, your school is failing big time. |`|LIMpgJtYaa	Don't be afraid, and certainly don't show him you're afraid.    Ask him/her what he wants, if he has issues. If he acts all smart, say something like, "No, seriously. Why must a tough guy like you pick on someone weaker? Just to prove yourself? That you're tough? By picking on a weaker person?"    Something along those lines. Bullies are surprisingly scared of confrontations. They continue picking on people who seem irritated but do nothing about it.    Or you could just ignore him, BUT don't appear bothered by him. Just realize that he probably has issues, and is being beyond pathetic by picking on you, but that's not your problem.

Ganhei duas papagaias de uma amiga. Mas elas eram de um prostbulo ent?o a nica coisa que elas sabem dizer  algo muito, muito desagradvel. Que me deixa constrangida toda vez que chega algum em casa.

t6k3yoNdaa	:S I agree.<br>  I thought it was good but not AMAZING. It didn't deserve best picture that much, I was hoping something like Milk or Frost/Nixon (which didn't win a thing!)<br>  <br>  What sucks is that Bruce Springsteen wasn't nominated for his song "The Wrestler" I was hoping for that \:<br>  Once again Oscars was a big dissapointment expcet for Heath Ledger winning :D|`|3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	Remember that the nominations for the technical categories are picked by Academy members working in those categories. Cinematographers pick cinematography; editors pick editing; etc. With that in mind, you have to figure these people know how to spot quality.<br>  <br>  The winners are voted on by the full Academy from the nominated films.<br>  <br>  As for the song category. I think Jai Ho was the best of the 3 nominated songs, but I have yet to hear a valid reason for why Bruce Springsteen was not nominated for The Wrestler.|`|Klb4ZYcVaa	Yes, critics have other ways of seeing it, but I believe they deserved it. I haven't seen any British/Indian movie winning this much. Including it won 7 BAFTAS, which is like the British Oscars. It was well deserved.<br>  <br>  There wasn't alot of money for the film, it was a low budget film. What kind of movie has a low budget film & STILL became an Oscar favorite?! I'm very glad the Oscars didn't pick an American movie, this year was very different. Besides, they only focus on the plot, story, direction, etc. Not if it was made by Americans, Asians, etc.|`|KMrclzpLaa	I actually havn't seen it yet. but no i don't think it is that good. It sounds like the kind of film you would only want to watch once. I think It won so many awards because <br>  <br>  1. it was based on actual events<br>  2. there was a lot of money put into the film<br>  and 3. the publicity of the woman who had an affair with her co-worker|`|3T2s2Snuaa	me neither.<br>  <br>  What happened to: Milk, Gran Torino, The Wrestler, Frost/Nixon, the Dark Knight, Iron Man, and the Incredible Hulk?  All of these movies were better then slumdog to me, I could see it winning one or maybe even a couple, but come on its not like its the freaking godfather or LOTR, there were lots of good movies this go round which is rare so why not spread it out a little.|`|DkvLTloSaa	yes best indian movie winning 8 oscar for the first time.|`|tPoVzNXwaa	I agree with you.  It was good/okay.  But I think there was too much hype about it.|`|8e4506c476b48324af970127ad5cd76faa	Well it had a great soundtrack so those awards were deserved.  The cinematography and direction was fantastic, but those other awards?  Who knows what the heck sound mixing is anyway?  <br>  <br>  I guess it deserved best Picture because it was my favorite 2008 movie.  Mind you, I haven't seen Milk or Frost/Nixon or a few other though, so I may change my mind one day.<br>  <br>  Chop Shop should have been nominated for Best Picture as well.|`|XjcrMNBuaa	havent seen it<br>  =)

It's cute til they wipe it on you, your furniture or your rug!!! Or worse yet, they eat it!!! lol|`|4zuTkXW2aa	Um, ewwww.  I taught my babies to blow their noses.  My first child had to learn how to SNIFF (flowers and such) I had been so good about teaching her to blow in a tissue she didn't understand sniff.

bYWTE40Vaa	Snow sure  Ice, not so much|`|ctglkb4Paa	yes but im scared s.h.i.t.l.e.s.s of other drivers|`|uWJnb1Y9aa	ok|`|fT15YEkFaa	yes, 35 winters in minnesota zero crashes|`|f9b40efd5b7600a550f492fb27e76707aa	I am so - so  It did take me an hour and 1/2 to get in this morning (usual drive is 45 mins)|`|DnWsMhwLaa	no. i am completely afraid every time it snows. i mean i guess i am ok at it, i just hate it and my car is lightweight and horrible for it.|`|AA11523465	I hate doing it, but I'm getting better.  I've had no choice.|`|LWvh2g2maa	Yes, I think I am now.  I lived in Germany for three years and they don't plow their streets very well nor do they lay down salt.  After getting into three accidents while I was there, I am a much better driver in the snow.|`|4472d6c8b8a41746c6129264601312c7aa	No, I try to avoid it! Too scary. I can't even ride my bike when it snows.|`|A3JTN2U4aa	i can't drive. :(|`|104438d9470075b52ae2790e7acd04fbaa	I've lived in Cleveland all of my adult life, so I'm pretty used to driving in the snow. And yes, I think I'm good at it. I've never had an accident.  It's the other people I worry about.|`|0VmWIcHAaa	I don't even consider myself a good driver when their is no snow|`|S7VJ1GDdaa	I was born in Tucson,AZ, but when I was 5 y o, my dad moved us to Wyoming. I am very grateful for that now because that is where I learned to drive. He worked for the State and had to plow the roads when it snowed! Imagine it snowing up there(HA,HA0! Anyway, I moved back down to the southwest, and to my amazement people do not know how to drive on the snow. I stay home and let the crazies bang into each other. They think that they should be able to do the same speed limit as when the roads were dry. Thank God we do not get hardly any snow right here in the town I live i now. I also moved out of Wyoming because 40 below (wind chill factored in of course) was too DAMN cold for me! PEACE|`|WmBRd5hDaa	Yes, Considering I live in a snow belt, I have to, or depend on others to drive me. White outs still scare me, though.|`|fRFebMugaa	yes i think im a good driver in the snow just have to be careful and what out for other drivers some times its a pain in the butt have to get to work some how|`|wwzoqIvVaa	Pretty good, I guess.  There is a trick to it.|`|IIhiSprlaa	No, I have never driven in the snow.|`|GTeGDGzKaa	Yes that is why i installed the 4 inch steel plate on the front of my car    SteveC|`|9f68a1f4952a6fb1e0cfb91da91a5105aa	NOPE, that why I stay off the road in snow and ice|`|aKBqMLuhaa	Most Certainly! Right from the start; I took my drivers test the day after a major snow storm, at age 15. I did a hill stop on ice/snow, in a standard transmission car. I passed with flying colors.   Since then I have had lots of practice and many close call mishaps (due to other peoples poor driving skills) that could have been much much worse. It probably helps that I live in Maine. We drive in snow for at least 3 months a year.  I now have an AWD car and that makes it even easier. I love my Subaru.|`|VEXKm1Obaa	Im damn good at driving in the snow but it does help that I drive a jacked up off road truck with killer tires.
5P3cHR4Taa	ORGY!|`|buUTakKAaa	i want to be burnt and then sprinkled from a high altitude, so the oceans, lakes, forests, communities are filled with a long lasting presence of me. <br>  <br>  my particles will be seeds of new growth in the earth. when they fall to the ground, and inject in the ground, precipitation and sun will give them life, and new awesome plants will arise. <br>  <br>  their pollen will spread, and soon i will spread throughout the world. <br>  conquer.|`|547Ln6rNaa	Big D wants us all cremated and kept together, including the dogs. We have our last dog cremated when she passed away last year, she's in the living room on the fire place. We will all sit on a shelf together. <br>  <br>  Provision has been made for us all to go off to a mausoleum when the last person in our family that gave a sht about us doesn't want us cluttering up their house any more. It's paid for in advance for lifetime care.|`|uqMK3rUZaa	That would be very entertaining! When you died I'd like to have the privilege of seeing that. Just don't make it any time soon. You have plenty of living to do.<br>  <br>  Me: cremated and my ashes spread. There are only so many places you can bury a body. Best scenario: rapture! :o)|`|4YnoykD2aa	I'm donating my brain to the Mayo Clinic to study because I have a super-bad case of bipolar. More research is needed. It's theirs. The rest of me is ashes scattered in the ocean.|`|n7BuH75gaa	I want to be cremated. I want my organs and other things needed by anyone used up.|`|KO5extXiaa	I'd like to go underground, I suppose.|`|TudZYPN5aa	they can do whatever.  i'm dead.|`|ozWi3TJlaa	After my organs are donated, I'm being cremated and my ashes are being put into a Maxwell House 2-lb. coffee can (I already have it).  The top is to be duct-taped shut.  Then my husband (or children) are to have a party, at which there is a rented, pink, blow up, bouncy Princess Castle.  Everyone is to take a turn bouncing inside the castle with my ashes (the reason for the duct tape).<br>  <br>  There is to be food and drink to excess, and nobody is required to say anything nice about me unless they feel like it.<br>  <br>  Later on, my family is to scatter my ashes wherever they like.  I won't care.|`|eKOgRHa6aa	I don't really care.. actually maybe cremated I don't want my body being exposed to necrophiliacs lol although I've HEARD that some.. what would they be called the people in the morgue? Uh Foresic Pathologists? Anatomists? I dunno but I've heard that some have been caught out or something having sex with dead bodies. Maybe that's just some people's insecurities making up those stories.|`|LQKW39SEaa	i want mine stuffed in a box and thrown out to sea<br>  and wait until 4080 when the future is like that past <br>  with pirates<br>  and have them open it and there is my dead rotting body=D<br>  <br>  but i like your chicken idea way better<br>  i may just have em dress me up like a clown or cow...hehe<br>  scare kids either way|`|rNTcO6Zlaa	STUFFED AND MOUNTED FIRST IN MY LIVING ROOM FOR A FEW WEEKS (SO THE KIDS RESPECT AND FEAR ME EVEN AFTER I'M DEAD).<br>  <br>  THEN I WOULD WANT TO BE PUT IN MY PRIVATE MAUSOLEUM, ABOVE MY CASKET, SO AS TO SCARE THE GHOST AND ALL THE OTHER SPIRITS FROM TRYING TO MAKE ME COME BACK TO LIFE TO DEVOUR HUMAN/ANIMAL BRAINS.|`|23HBEDHqaa	donate my organs and either bury me with a pink rosebush and a weeping willow tree making my grave or cremate me where would like put my ashes into the books that i loved.|`|G2gf2ZJyaa	i want to be cremated and my ashed to be keeped with my family|`|HrDcaocMaa	Buried - but hopefully not alive!|`|pfR5t4zkaa	Donate my organs (other than my eye's; I don't want anyone seeing what I see)<br>  Then burn me..

2ersp6Lfaa	At the end of the OFFICIAL series, Miaka made a wish that "Somehow, some way, her and Tamahome could be together."<br>  Her wish worked, as opposed to the Byakko priestess, because she didn't care how it happened, while Byakko just wanted to stay in the book.<br>  <br>  ANYWAYS, what Suzaku did was reincarnate Tamahome out of the book and into the real world. He seems to be the same age, look the same.. but his memories are all different. He has a new family, and his knowledge of being a warrior seems to be through "dreams" (this is only mentioned in passing, mind you.)<br>  <br>  Now, we go into the OAV's, where Tamahome, now known as Taka, actively searches out for his memories of a warrior. This part is not very exciting, but anyways, he eventually does, and te series ends with him and Miaka sitting on a hill at night, with a little boy of their own.<br>  <br>  If something I explained didn't quite make sense, feel free to msg me.

Nick is so religious it would break him down so much that people could see it if he found out he was gay. Joe is not gay (even tho he does have that gorgeous look to him at times) because there is at least one shred of real proof that he isnt. at the secret signing for Camp Rock in London, Demi Lovato was talking about a guy she liked and Joe clearly had that look of jealousy...rolling eyes and what not. please what gay guy would be jealous of a girl's crush on another guy? if he wasnt jealous, he wouldnt care at all so he wouldnt be rolling his eyes. he wouldnt pretend for any reason because that would just get people to think even more that Jemi exists and he wouldnt put Demi through that so he was obviously trying not to look jealous. you could tell he was trying not to because every now and then of her talking about the guy he would smile like nothing was wrong.<br>  unfortunately I cant find the video for the secret signing (I used to be able to find it but it must have got deleted..ugh stupid youtube) I swear to God that this video is real tho and he was rolling his eyes. believe me when I swear to God I mean it because I am a Christian.<br>  <br>  I dont doubt that Joe is bisexual tho because he sometimes seem like it. hopefully his boyfriend would be Garbo if he was, thatd be sexy. i love Jarbo!<br>  <br>  <br>  I highly doubt Kevin is because he knows alot about romance with girls. I dont see how a gay guy would know about that. most importantly tho, he doesnt have that gay look to him. gay guys have that gorgeous/feminine look to them. I knew that something was off about Lance Bass from the moment he appeared onto the scene..his mannerisms, his face... it was all wrong. <br>  I think people just think he looks gay because of his baby face. he doesnt even look bisexual to me. I could be wrong about him tho so if he was bisexual/gay why should that matter? hes still the same guy.|`|Wu9SjRCXaa	I've got excellent Gay-dar (they don't have to be flaming for me to know) and I think the oldest one is for sure.

0f43ff2eed25039880a5e743d8087199aa	Actually I kind of like that song..it's Eminem so true fans expect something wild and retarded...and we love it.  Crack A Bottle is a good come back song and Em has always done some "light" stuff and the hard stuff all in one album.  It's just who he is.|`|gUYcVXMTaa	It is an okay song the lyrics dont go hard but it is not all that bad.  I do agree that if this is what can be expected on the album then that is not good.  But all albums have that radio song that is cheesy!  Im mean look at  my name is LOL!  It was a pretty cheesy song but it was on a great album!  What is the old saying im thinking of...............Dont judge a book by its cover!|`|rxScdXM4aa	maybe he means it in a get rid of the alcohol kind of way|`|ysqburTVaa	It isn't. It's going on 50's album, which shows that that song probably isn't the direction he wants to take with the album. And Em always has songs that he just messes around in. Now I'm not expecting any songs as lyrically good as Stan or Kim, but I doubt that Relapse is going to be a disappointment.|`|kW5hklQgaa	Yeh in the song doesnt he say "Lick the cheese from under my nuts"??<br>  <br>  If so,, its not very impressive or thoughfull is it.<br>  <br>  I think the upcoming Rick Ross album is guna bang!!

Totally destroyed it.  Edward was so wrong. Robert is not Edward.   Its hard to fit everything in the book to a movie that can only last 2 hours max. They done an okay job, but it could have been a lot better.  Alice, Jasper, Emmett, Esme, Billy Black, Bella, Eric, Jessica and Mike were perfectly cast, in my opinion.|`|MSnBbQA5aa	i hated the movie liked the book  the movie is for the male actor to get him famous cause ''every'' girl likes him|`|sTE0FUbtaa	Well, I completely understand what you're saying about the details thing, however it is virtually impossible for a movie to include all the details of a book (Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings,etc). Setting that aside, I thought it was okay. I was actually pleasantly surprised by Rob Pattinson's performance as Edward. I thought he did an excellent job. Kristen Stewart, as Bella, however, was a disaster. First off, Stewart looks like Bella, but she most certainly doesn't act like her. To me, Bella is a passionate girl in love and is very passionate about Edward. Kristen Stewart's version of Bella is very dull, and almost kind of cold. It could have been much better. Also, the special effects were incredibly lame (the glittery Edward?) and I also thought that their romance was way too rushed. Thanks|`|si94hvgsaa	I did like the movie but compared to the book i hated the movie because it lacked detail and the characters are completely not who i expected and they showed emotion that wasn't shown in the book. also i think it underestimates the the greatness of the book.

I honestly and truly, cross my heart, and go with men on this one.   they definitely have it worse.    you know how OBG's slide things into us to check us?  when guys have problems there, it's a lot more uncomfortable when the doctor sticks a moving tube in that little hole.. and it's cold, i heard it's very cold.      men have it worse :)|`|1bZdP9UMaa	i have seen the worst among boys|`|heEN0Zghaa	Haha girls.

But if you do laugh at yourself make sure your crush is in the hallway. :)|`|zhK1PGioaa	yes. i would totally laugh at myself. it means that you're not embarrased and that you can laugh not only at other people but at yourself 2.<br>  =]

Mother-kid relationships are sooo typical. It's a basic thing. However, I like fathers and their children together. I don't know, I always thought of it as being cute when a father is holding his baby or spending time with his kid, playing or doing anything. The same goes for a mother, like she 's at the park playing instead of just watching, but the father-kid relationship seems more interesting, especially if the kid is younger than a teen.|`|Vq49MWgraa	Ya,,, it's very nice, but do you know what's nice, I always love it when I see a father holding his baby between his arms.|`|ce7ea7f83a5ba171eb4ef78c629b25a3aa	I think you would be a great dad one day and no that is not weird just a shame there are not more people like you out there.

9bSCOZB1aa	I don't know about any albums, but I do know they are a pretty good band. A friend told me about them long before they became more popular due to Guitar Hero 3s free download of their songs, and they're very unique. They sound like Irish music with a metal twist, definitely worth checking out.
1Mc6BOvKaa	I don't live in that area, but I can safely say that they will all be breaking the law if they let you in, I'm afraid.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but that's the law, and legally they can be taken to court (by the police or by your parents) for allowing you to see a film you aren't old enough for. This means that if they care about staying open, they'll make sure their staff check IDs. Obviously, some might slip up, but don't bank on it.<br>  <br>  You can try any, but don't get your hopes up.

t0KTJr8xaa	What you really need to do is put down the pen and paper for a while.<br>  Movies are a bad source of inspiration for anything other than cliche soudtrack sounding songs, and I would say that video games are probably the same sort of bad. Listening to other songs can inspire, but if you're looking for original, it can be dangerous.<br>  Watching your surroundings won't work, because they don't move, which is more than likely what your problem is: you need to change it up a bit. That's almost always why inspiration runs dry, because one's been sitting for too long.<br>  * Try switching your surroundings for a day - if you live in the city, go to the mountains, if you live in the suburbs, go to a beach or lake or river. and vice-versa works just as well.<br>  * Try listening to your bandmates or friends or even your younger siblings. Ask them any random question that comes to mind, have them elaborate on it... play the shrink and take notes.<br>  * Open the dictionary to a random page, select a random, interesting, three syllable word and try to write a song about it (I swear that's how Nightwish wrote Amaranth!)<br>  * Pick a random medieval poem or play, and play with it until you get a song out of it.<br>  * Make a list of your favorite and least favorite things: something on it should inspire you.<br>  *** My Best Tip: READ! Yes, I know, most people hate to read, but the fact remains that reading is like a warm-up for writing, just like stretching before ballet (or whatever). When you read, all those words will be fresher in your mind, therefore it should be easier for you to find the right descriptive words for anything. <br>  I know what I mean, and I hope that you at least try some of my suggestions out. And that they work for you.<br>  Good luck!|`|j7imnQ7Naa	i love ur bands name! <br>  and its hard to write songs now because everyone writes about the same thing and every song sounds pretty much the same.<br>  <br>  and inspirations come from everything. you have to be very open minded, relaxed, and notice things that could spark an idea. write about a deceased family you loved. write about ur feelings for someone. write about a time when you thought there was no hope and you couldnt go on. write about nature. maybe make up a story and turn it into a song.<br>  <br>  hope i helped!|`|kP0JGI1waa	You prob just need to take a break.  Completely forget about songwriting for a while and wait until something hits you.  Then immediately write it down.  You have worked your creativity so much that it just needs to be recharged.
3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	The main purpose of those ads - as with most forms of advertising - is to create "brand" awareness.

I know that the band of villains with Spiral are known as the Reavers and after my extensive research I have to deduce that the female mutant steering the outside of the ship would have had to have been DeathStrike. <br>  <br>  Here are their names of the members of The Reavers:<br>  <br>  Bonebreaker, (male)<br>  Donald Pierce, (male)<br>  Pretty Boy (male)<br>  Skullbuster, (male) <br>  Deathstrike, (female-black hair)<br>  Cylla, (female-blond)<br>  Skullbuster, (female-skull face)

I like to tickle, and be tickled.  In fact, one of the cleaners came on our train yesterday when we arrived at the station and because his hands were somewhat dirty, put his elbows up, and told me to do the same thing.  I asked, "What are you going to do now, tickle me?"   He said that he wouldn't because he knows that I am quite ticklish.  I told him that I liked it, and he came back and did it.  <br>  <br>  Before any of you out there ask, he is straight.  I'm not.|`|iNC2Yimlaa	It would depend on who was doing the asking.

Most of the people I know well and know to be ticklish are people I would happily tickle anyway.  It's also tricky to imagine someone asking me without it being fairly clear beforehand that the answer would almost surely be yes.  It would certainly be fun for both parties, or possibly helpful in certain situations (thinking of the only example that comes to mind of such a question being asked and coming as a total surprise - Fortunes of War, in which Rupert Graves asks Kenneth Branagh to tickle his feet), and there's always the likelihood of increasing the amount of tickling both given and received in the friendship, a good thing in my book.|`|32jUzwdLaa	~~~~~tickle?...please...? hee hee of course<br>  and then tackle and conquer!!! yeps!

7BNV1fYMaa	you mean acoustic, and because acoustic's/classic guitars are much harder to play. So you will learn how to directly hit your notes. I'm taking beginner guitar, a couple a months later, I was in a band. I play lead guitar. Although an eletric is infact easier to play, an acousitc will give you alot of practice. So good luck and all. EXAMPLE: Kinda like them movies where the main character would train to get faster by tieing rocks to his legs. so when he tooke them off, he was much faster and stronger.|`|2JBwCLwgaa	you don't have to learn it I mean I didn't but if you choose to it definqtley will help maybe just learn some basic chords......for you I would recommend ultimate guitar tabs archcive it's a great way to learn almost any song by any band|`|9bSCOZB1aa	Your friends are DEFINITELY very wrong. You don't need to learn classical guitar first. I started off with electric and taught myself, and after a little over a year I'm doing great and playing music I love.|`|EnRjLaKsaa	I dont think that that is true at all.  Why don't you just start out with a nice air guitar.  They are light weight and super cheap.
SIaTnM5Qaa	use the firefox browser...then get the addons "DownloadHelper" or "Download Themall"....works for me.....or you can get the "Orbit Downloader"....juss google what i say then you'll find it....good luck....
GjtIXiK9aa	'Go' is a pretty generic title - I found at least eighteen songs with that title, but, as it is a female vocalist, it might be Amy Ray from The Indigo Girls, or it could be Mel C (Melanie Chisholm  - Sporty from the Spice Girls) or it could be Kelly Clarkson.  None are 80's, but the pop influence may have made it sound that way.|`|KOd5Spehaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yVXaw8yufY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yVXaw8yu...</a><br>  i believe by fantasia<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RO6Pe2tKfao" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RO6Pe2tKf...</a><br>  valentine<br>  i like this one<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RO6Pe2tKfao" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RO6Pe2tKf...</a><br>  by louie

DPcIjHHZaa	death note it's one of my favorite anime ever it's the closest thing to code geass.<br>  here the plot:Shinigami own notebooks called “Death Notes” which are used as killing devices. Whoever’s name they write down in a death note will die within 40 seconds. Shinigami Ryuk dropped his Death Note in the human world where it’s found by honor high school student Light. With the death note actually having directions in it for its use, Light discovers he now has the power to discreetly kill people, and with this new power he plans to change the world in his ideal world by killing off criminals. Eventually the governments of the countries around the world notice the unusual amounts of deaths of their criminals, and figure out someone is behind them, but they have no way of discovering it themselves. That’s when they hire L, a master detective, to find out who is behind the murders.|`|9i7wOcDwaa	Try Samurai Champloo.
