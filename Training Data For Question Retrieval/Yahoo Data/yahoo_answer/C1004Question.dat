20090223075100AA0uZEA	Sports;Tennis	How to get the most out of playing a 4.5 player when you are 4.0?	I am a low 4.0 player with a good speed and a decent consistency.  With those skills, I can give a good fight to 4.5 level players though they eventually beat me.  I have a weaker backhand compared to forehand and that is usually the difference maker. Still, they love to play with me because they get to try some shots which normally they couldn't do with fellow 4.5 players.   Usually, I end up being the counter puncher without being able to execute some of my favorite shots.  Sometimes, I even feel that I should stop playing them.  However, my gut tells me that the opportunity is good and I should get the maximum benefit out of playing these 4.5 level players.  I just don't know how? please advise...

20090223080104AAbH0dO	Sports;Wrestling	How do you like my Wrestlemania 25 card?	let’s start with what we already know, Randy Orton will be facing Triple H for the WWE Championship on the grandest stage of em all. I don’t know about all of you, but that match alone (with the storyline behind it) is reason enough for me to order. Randy Orton, as I’ve said many times before, is the top heel in the company right now and has shown that he deserves to main event the show. Triple H, is, well Triple H. He doesn’t need to prove anything, he’s The Game, and together these two have awesome chemistry. Should be an amazing match no matter what.      Its pretty much a lock that HBK and Undertaker will be facing off. I like it. The only gripe I have is how this match is being set up. JBL and HBK will fight for the “right” to face ‘Taker. Then we add Kozlov from Smackdown for no other reason than the fact he’s undefeated. To me, it seems like at least two of these guys should have “heat” with Undertaker and not just want to face him to beat his streak. What would be awesome to see is HBK bring back that cocky, heartbreak heel attitude he once had. Oh those were the days! Anyway, now that Shawn for one reason or another, hates to play the full-fleged heel we get this build-up instead. Here’s my question to all of you dedicated Dog Pound readers…should Shawn turn heel or not?      This of course leaves guys like John Cena and Edge open. There you go, there’s the match right there Cena vs. Edge for the World Heavyweight title. Now, as much as I like Edge I feel that his title wins are becoming so frequent that they’re begining to mean less and less. Of course there’s the whole possibility of Cena vs. Hogan (gag me!) which would free Edge to face Big Show.      Cena vs. Hogan is not a match I want to see…ever. Let’s face it, the two men would get a whopping 45-50 minutes to have a match, and there would be a grand total of 5 moves! This match of course is only speculation and rests heavily on what Mr. Mickey Rourke intends to do with Jericho. There is also a possible Hogan vs. Jericho match lined up as well should Rourke not participate.      Edge vs. Big Show I wouldn’t mind seeing as long as Show plays the tweener gimmick where “oops, it must have been an oversight!” Now that would be classic. Show is always best in my opinion when he’s not the menacing heel, but not the cuddly, giant softy babyface either.      In terms of a diva’s match, the WWE is trying to get trish Stratus to return for a match against Michelle McCool. You read that right, Trish vs. McCool. This bothers me. You have perhaps the greatest women’s wrestler of all time in Trish Stratus returning on the biggest stage of them all, and you’re going to have her face McCool. Not Beth, Mickie, Melina, Natalya, or even Jiliian Hall (who can wrestle) no, you get Michelle McCool. McCool does nothing for me as a face or heel and as much as she has improved her in-ring skills, I think there are many others worthy of the spot.      Then of course there is the MITB Ladder Match. Assuming the WWE puts eight guys in like last year, I’ll share you my choices. Taking out Matt and Jeff Hardy assuming they have their own one on one match, here we go. From Raw..Kofi Kingston, Rey Mysterio, and Santino Marella. Smackdown…MVP, The Brian Kendrick, and Shelton Benjamin. And from ECW….John Morrison, and the returning Evan Bourne. What’d ya think??      Well that does it for now peeps, and remember feedback is always welcome.

Now that the B's have lost 5 of the last 6 I don't seem to see the annoying Bruins bandwagoner fans around much any more. The 4-3 loss yesterday was just disgusting. Losing to the 2nd worst team in the east on 18 shots. Ference getting a 2 minute penalty with less than 3 minutes left for a puck over the glass and then giving up a goal a minute later.       I myself have been disgusted with the teams play of late. They are not playing the full 60. They are not hitting or dominating play like they were a month ago. Lucic is suddenly a wuss, Kessel has disappeared and the team just looks like its just coasting to the playoffs.        Now no disrespect to FL or TB over the weekend. They came out ready to play and took it to the B's. I also know that the Bruins has 2 fights in the first period and Kessel actually scored, but to me it seems the wheels are falling off (like most have said all year would happen, and I agreed) and it needs to be fixed real quick      So the Question is. What do the B's need to do to get back to where they were in the beginning of the season? Trade, intensity, nothing?? Do you also think that the Caps will catch them for first overall??

Is he just bluffing because whenever he sneezes he squints really hard and I can tell hes in real pain and I think he just doesn't want to say.      If he's not recovered, he won't heal properly so I'm just wondering if anyone has ever broken a rib or something of similar pain intensity and how long it took you to cycle again. (He's 48)      Thanks. :)

20090223093445AAEAZaC	Sports;Football (American)	Will the Seahawks bounce back after an awkward season?	Granted seattle had the most injuries and injured reserves then any other nfl team by far. The whole offense line was on IR. patrick kerney on IR. Seneca Wallace was quarterback for 9 games throwing to wide receivers named Michael Bumpus and Courtney Taylor?????       Seattle had one bad year and now has franchised leroy hill. They have a active coach out of Jim Mora Jr and he has brought in great talent on both sides of the ball.       I know everything is all over the cardinals and think they run the divison now. Lets recap real quick though. Each year Kurt Warner is getting older. Boldin is most likely not going to resign. Yeah Fitzgerald is a beast but defense's will now focus on him now that he is exposed. Not saying they will shut him down but they will do much better. And oh yeah Marcus Trufant shut him down both times with a broken hand.    He was switched over to face 5'10 josh wilson. He destroyed wilson.      ut again the cardinals odds of doing what they did again is very slim.       The 49ers looked very promising but the QB situation is a issue and issac bruce is getting very old. Vernon davis is not being used properly.       The rams just suck. Sorry. Terrible team all together. They  need many years to recover.       I say seattle wins the divison next year. People must forget that they have the 2nd most playoff wins since 2005. Only team with more is the Patriots. They have john carlson who was 9th overall out of all TE's and he was a rookie.

To me the New Stadium looks pretty much the same as the old stadium(except the giant scoreboard in LF) minus the history and tradition. The originial Yankee Stadium was in fine shape and it seems as if the new stadium its just a duplicate with no history and tradition so far. Does anybody else feel like the New Yankee Stadium looks almost the same as the old one? And how many of you are sad the old stadium is gone?

20090223100631AACxitJ	Sports;Swimming & Diving	Swimming pool waves people making?	Hi, so heres my question.....back when i was in midddle school in swim class all i remember is not bringing my swimming trunks beacuse i just didnt feel like swimming that day, lol. So anyways, anybody who came unprepared sat up in the bleachers and watched everyone. (Pretty typical im sure) ANYYYWAYSS..... Towards the end of the 45 minute swimming class, the teacher had everyone stand from one side to the other side of the pool (on the shallow end side) and then from the shallow end facing the wall had everyone count to 3 while taking 3 steps backwards, then while still facing shallow wall, walking forward again to the end, touching the wall again.....the whole class did this repeatley over and over in as much in sync as possible.  When i watched as he had them do this, myself or NOBODY else (as back when your a kid, dont quite understand how everything works) didnt know why he had them do that....eventaually tho i started seeing this very small wave going from the shallow end to the deep end, then bounce back from deep to shallow end....as they kept taking those three steps back and forth, within minutes it turned out bigger and bigger and then it ended up being as big as a TIDAL WAVE!!! It was really cool watching it from my own eyes and boy did i regret not wanting to swim that day after that LOL.  This pool didnt have any machines that were hooked up or equiped as far as i know, nor did it EVER make waves before..... My qyestion is (since i cant find it ANYWARE ONLINE)... How does that happen? Is is the back and forward motion of all the swimmers cause it? Please help cuz i just had a dream about this last night and thats why im asking this now!!!!!! Thanks!

20090223104724AA41yqM	Sports;Cricket	Is Kevin Pietersen the most contradictory man in cricket?	Kevin Pietersen has yet again demonstrated his capacity for contradicting himself. When Allen Stanford landed his helicopter at Lord's and was lauded as the saviour of English cricket, Pietersen expressed his excitement at the money on offer in Twenty20 cricket. He even signed up as an "ambassador" for Stanford.      Now the former England captain has been telling the News of the World (a real quality newspaper - not!) that he was always uneasy with Stanford, and said that he felt the England team had been sold.      Pietersen has said "It was not that I was captain at the time, it was the uncomfortable situation of everybody thinking the England team had been sold. With the financial state of the world, people were talking about money instead of cricket"      He went on to say "Those kind of things just didn't seem right to me, so it's not a bad thing we are not going to have that tournament any more" (speaking of the Stanford event).      Is this yet another example of Kevin Pietersen wanting to portray himself in the best possible light, to help promote Brand Pietersen, even if it flies in the face of earlier statements he has made? Is he the most contradictory man in cricket? Is he stupid?

As we know the new Marlins Stadium is going to be on the Orange Bowl site, and they are going to save the Orange Bowl sign atop of the Orange Bowl's scoreboard to preserve some history. I think they should call it the Orange Bowl Ballpark to continue the history and tradition that the Orange Bowl had in that very spot. The Orange Bowl had 70 years of football tradition and might have been maybe the most prestigious stadium in NCAA football. Its obvious the Orange Bowl was dilapidated and crumbling and the Marlins new stadium is going to be beautiful but they should still try to continue the tradition somewhat. Should the Marlins name the new ballpark the Orange Bowl Ballpark?

20090223103027AAICLny	Sports;Baseball	Once again Donald Fehr doesn't care about fixing the steroid problem?  I suppose this is the Yankees Fault?->?	Read this latest nonsense that Fehr said concerning the Steroid controversy.       Donald Fehr says union won't reveal names of 103 players who failed drug test in 2003      By TOM D'ANGELO      Palm Beach Post Staff Writer      Monday, February 23, 2009      JUPITER — Donald Fehr, the head of the major league baseball players association, said Monday the union will do everything possible to ensure the names of the remaining 103 players who tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs in 2003 are not revealed.      "By contract all other information except the group results are supposed to remain confidential and we hope and expect that it will remain so," Fehr said. "We'll do whatever we reasonably can to make sure of that."      ehr started his tour of all 30 major league camps Monday by meeting with the Marlins. This year's discussion included the recent leaking of Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez's name to Sports Illustrated as one of the 104 players who tested positive in 2003.      Rodriguez later admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs from 2001-03, while he was with the Texas Rangers.      Fehr remains bothered that tests of which the individual results were sealed under court orders were leaked.      "It is troublesome to me that you see reports which suggest that the anonymous source of the report was doing so in violation of a court order and that that was known to the reporter that wrote it," Fehr said. "That's a real problem to me. I thought we were all supposed to honor court orders."      The 2003 drug tests, part of the first drug-testing agreement between MLB and its players, called for a survey test which both sides agreed to keep confidential. If more than 5 percent of the players tested positive, baseball would install a more stringent program.      Between 5 and 6 percent - 104 players - tested positive.      Part of the agreement was that the results of the tests would be destroyed once they were finalized and tabulated. The process of destroying the tests and urine samples had begun when the government issued a subpoena for the tests as part of its investigation into steroid distribution by BALCO, the Bay Area-based supplement company.      "Once that happens you can't do it," Fehr said.      The union informed its players that the results could not have been destroyed so quickly without suspicion that the union was hiding something.      Now, many believe everybody who played in 2003 is under suspicion.      "If that's the judgment, it seems to me that is entirely wrong," Fehr said. "Slightly over 94 percent were negative. People ought to make mention of that."      A small number of players, including the Marlins' Wes Helms, Philadelphia's Brad Lidge, former Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling, have called for the remaining 103 names to be revealed.      Fehr said no players have expressed that desire to him.      "The contract provided the information would remain confidential and that's an obligation that is owed both by the union and by major league baseball to all individual players," Fehr said.      Baseball commissioner Bud Selig has said he is considering possible discipline against Rodriguez. Fehr said he does not believe discipline is warranted and he has "no reason to think" that there will be any.      "Everybody understands that there were things which happened in the early part of the decade, which we wish hadn't," Fehr said. "That's not the case anymore. We fixed the problem and we need to look forward, as Bud as said many times."      Other issues Fehr addressed with reporters Monday:      - On a Sports Illustrated report that Gene Orza, MLB's chief operating officer, said Rodriguez was tipped off to a drug test in September 2004: "It's an old allegation. There is no evidence for it as far as I can tell. Nobody has ever told us who or when or why or what. And yet it just gets repeated and people don't seem to feel they have an obligation even to do basic research. That's troublesome."      - On the number of unsigned high-profile free agents and the possibility of collusion among owners: "We hope that there isn't. We hope that the people that have yet to sign will sign. There have been a number of them in recent days. If we conclude that there has been any violation of the contract going on we'll take action to remedy it. I don't want to comment on that unless and until we reach that conclusion."
20090223104802AALXBcN	Sports;Wrestling	Undisputed Championship?	Since 2005 its been a trend that the WWE and WHC's have been switching brands between RAW and SD. Last year Triple H got drafted to SD, again leaving a brand without a champion. Now Edge has "stolen" the WHC and RAW has no champion.       Who agrees that bringing back the Undisputed Champion would solve this problem? It would unify two of the major belts and leave one so that no brand would be without a champion.      Would you wanna rather see the  World Heavyweight and ECW Championships unified or the WWE and World Heavyweight Championships combined?

My parents have been NASCAR fans since 1959, and my brothers and sisters and I were raised on watching the races, we've traveled to watch them, we've sold cars to by tickets. But what none of us like is the fact that all the fun seems to have been drained from the sport. All the "NEW IMPROVEMENTS" and rules have made the sport into something (imo) that is all about $$$$ and not back home fun!   Granted I understand that the $ and the sponsors are what makes the NASCAR world go round, but what about what the fans themselves want to see. I dont know about you but I'd rather watch short track races over the super speedways. The longer they are the worse they are getting.       so what kinds of complaints do you have about the "NEW AND IMPROVED" NASCAR?

Here's what I'd like to see.       1- Don't hire another QB coach if you're going to keep Warner.    2- Sign Warner for 3 Years    3- The first 2 years of Warner's contract are as a QB for the AZ Cardinals   4- The 3rd Year he transitions into a QB Coaching position   5- Put in his contract that in the event that he is hurt and unable to play, that he will act as the QB coach for Leinart or whoever they have as 2nd string.    6- Pay Warner 9 Million a Year for 2 Years, and then an additional amount equivalent to a QB Coaching position for the 3rd Year.
