BSU9pNUWaa	The laws in Canada actually very from providence to providence but the federal laws are as follows:<br>  <br>  Under 17:<br>  "May be employed only if not required to be at school under <br>  provincial legislation and the work involved falls outside <br>  excluded categories (e.g. underground work in a mine) and is <br>  unlikely to endanger health or safety.  Never between 11 p.m. <br>  and 6 a.m.  s. 179 (Act); s. 10 (Reg.) "<br>  <br>  Conclusion: No, I am assuming you are still required by law to attend school. By federal law you need to be 17 in Canada to receive working papers while under requirement to attend school.|`|KU0tnveUaa	Well, in the US you need to be 16 to work at mcd's and dq.  Not sure about Tim Hortans, but it is most likely 14 since I'm assuming it doesn't involve cooking.|`|9POUmVMGaa	I doubt it. I'm not sure about Canada but in the USA mcdonalds wont hire under 16 because 15 years olds are not allowed around moving parts|`|BtkoBL8uaa	You cant get a job at Mcdonalds or dairy queen but i think you can at tim hortans i worked there when i was 13.|`|cMRphaJfaa	I wouldn't think so. Here in US, most have to be at least 15 or older.<br>  Try something else like baby sitting or lawn care|`|AA11065180	the only thing that 13 years old allowed to do is a paper round. sorry|`|e3xzMnuHaa	noo you cant which is annoying but then agian who would want to work there at age 13?|`|OfTeSqoTaa	im 13 too, i wish! but no|`|tQsxsuNPaa	Child labor laws.  Not likely, even bussing tables till your next birthday.  No matter WHERE you live.|`|TPn3CEK0aa	NO.|`|JxzawJZVaa	you can but you need a special permit from your school.|`|pueeMH6gaa	Only in worthless third world countries without child labor laws like China or Pakistan.|`|KhPJIyXhaa	Nope, too young. Sorry.|`|qnq5ex89aa	no|`|hZVJRW7uaa	in Australia, if you are 13 and 9 months, you can get into Mc Donalds.<br>  Everything else, I highly doubt it. And Canada might be different.|`|PiLRsxtwaa	In America, you have to be 14 to work at real jobs, but most fast food places won't take anyone under 15. It might be different in Canada tho.|`|ExyPc0vMaa	No thats too young, try babysitting, 16 you can apply|`|9ib0tC9Waa	Idk about Canada, but in Oregon you have to be 14 and even then there are some tough restrictions.|`|ODvnyAdlaa	no you have to be 16 to be covered by their insurance x|`|aXXTHpHBaa	Yes if you know the owners|`|z7MPaUELaa	I don't think so. You need to be 14 to get a job in the U.S. and Most fast food places want you to be 16.|`|HyAvpatCaa	yes, but as a cleaner only, sorry
gaXUIduMaa	Many restaurants of a decent size will have audio visual equipment for business meetings.  If you have any problems, check with a hotel restaurant or a hotel with meeting rooms as they definately will.  Note that, if you are showing movies, the venue will insist that you have the legal permission to show it.  They will not want to get sued.|`|e75df6a664af3ce172ac45f21fda2e44aa	Cinespace in hollywood
