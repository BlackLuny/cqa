DWLfKACYaa	NCIS is a real organisation....so NCIS agent.....but to be honest, it's nothing like the TV show|`|asX2hxFXaa	FBI and Secret Service and also State Bureaus of Investigation (state level versions of FBI).  They're usually like CBI = California Burea of Investigation, etc.  But you might be more interested in CSU activities of large metropolises.|`|367926de3fa96492022d3fae80bbab42aa	The closest type of job to NCIS is called a detective or investigator. If your wanting to be an investigator or detective for local law enforcement you would have to be a patrol officer first and get promoted into investigations. Most types of federal law enforcement are investigators such as FBI, DEA, Secret Service etc. and federal law enforcement mostly requires a bachelors degree to apply. NCIS is actually a civilian federal law enforcement position. So if your interested in NCIS you can go to http://www.ncis.navy.mil/join.asp for additional details.|`|NTOZ8Q4Aaa	Well, the truth of the matter is that the cop shows you watch on TV. In real world, cases take weeks and years to solve, and they never show the hundreds of hours writing reports, making phone calls and interviewing people.

6810e02779e654863b71475b91405d0aaa	The free market economic system  is a way to allocate resources more efficiently   but  it does not replace morality and will not even function in an immoral society, Someone's  value  can not be measured by the amount they earn, most of the people who did important   things that we learn about in school  not did not become wealthy and most of the people who became wealthy did little of importance.    People are not paid what they are worth, their salary's are set by supply and demand like everything else in a market economy.  If there  were  a scarcity of janitors the salaries would be higher. Keeping things clean is worth a lot to society because living in filth promotes the spread of disease,  Garbage collectors save more lives than doctors.    You have only to look at the  people who ruined  the financial system of the county while making 200 million a year to know that  people can become wealthy without being  responsible or even competent.|`|CgGVpUI5aa	If they form a union, look for you labor costs to go up 33%.

You think money is unlimited, and that it grows on trees. It's not, money is only a facilitator of trade.

3iL7V04waa	I just went to MEPS in November and I wore a sports bra.  Some people wore regular bras, some people wore sports bras.  It really doesn't matter.  I'd say wear whatever you feel more comfortable in without clothes on.  Just don't wear any type of suggestive undergarments.|`|JDxpjT34aa	No, you cannot wear a sports bra to MEPS. They won't do a physical on you if you're wearing a sports bra. You have to be wearing a regular bra and regular panties (no thongs). You won't get in trouble but you may get sent away and have to come back a different day. I don't know what the reasoning is for no sports bra.|`|XoQTvtQUaa	no the millitary will issue all clothes..|`|SkWzsnuxaa	You may wear anything you want to MEPS. Once you arrive at Reception Station you will receive your military issue which will include sports bras. But even there you may find that the bras you bring are better than what you are issued. So buy sports bras for BCT that are drab in color and your Drill Sergeant will likely allow you to retain them. Otherwise when your DSs go through your baggage you will just end up locking them up with all the other civilian gear you bring with you to MEPS and Reception.     Best of Luck to you and welcome to the service!
RkfIPD7Iaa	You give him an ultimatum.  He stops doing it immediately, he pays you back immediately, or you call the police IMMEDIATELY.    Don't worry about the neighbors, worry about the thief.|`|AA11124254	You need to contact the police immediately and produce the bank records to show what he has been doing.  Request photo copies of the checks from the banks so that you can show the signatures are different.  Each instance of check fraud could potentially be two (2) felony counts because it is an instance of check fraud and forgery.  Don't worry about the neighbors, that is just silly.|`|ljoEmnviaa	your brother stole all your money and you are worried about the neighbors.  You sure it isn't his money.  me, I call the bank and let them know|`|mDgIsma9aa	confront him and tell him you will take out papers if he doesnt repay you|`|367926de3fa96492022d3fae80bbab42aa	If it was my brother I would notify the local police department with what evidence I had to support my accusation. I wouldn't care what my neighbors thought about the police coming over to investigate. If my brother stole from me I would have him charged. My family should have more respect of me than to steal from me and if they didn't I wouldn't care if they got in trouble. It's not my fault that they can't be trusted.     If you are really that concerned about the police coming to your house you can always call them and ask to make an appointment at the station to file a report.|`|QP7VyPV6aa	I learned through personal experience that everyone, especially family will take advantage if they are given the chance. Mostly because they know you will "get over it" because love is there!    But, when it actually becomes stealing from you and not just taking advantage, then its a big problem. I would begin by filing a police report. If he didn't care whether your finances and credit or if you had legal troubles for hot checks over all this, then you should care little about his feelings or troubles he can get into.     To keep the police from coming to your home, go to them. Go to your bank and get copies of all checks that are not your signature. Take these copies to the police and file a theft report.  I would then go to the bank, again, and ask them what their policy is for replacing stolen funds. Many banks will replace money stolen from you if you have a police report.  They MAY even be on the hook for cashing checks not matching your signature. That's kinda the point of the signature card, to prevent cashing checks not signed by yourself or someone else on your account.     I hope you get everything taken care of an your brother gets help for whatever ailment caused him to steal from you.|`|2dfc54c0eb87bcd7851f591498f1e09eaa	I have a brother who stole from me and I reported him to the police if you dint then your brother will think that he can steal from you and get away with it. I wouldn't worry about your neighbors and if you are really worried drive down to the police station and report it but either way you have to report it|`|Tl1b2lAHaa	Well, since I would ruin my life by killing him, I'd have to opt for closing the acct. and putting all my new info. into a safe, with no way of allowing him access to it.  Then I probably wouldn't talk to him for awhile.  He's family so you tend to give them a break, don't let yourself get so mad that you never talk to him again, but let him know that your not going to stand for it, by cutting him off from you for a while.
U0Rvsabdaa	No, I think they attacked to improve Barak and Livni's credibility with the hardliners. This little war proved they are capable of delivering what the hardliners want.     That said, the hardliners are still in the lead in their elections.    A lot of posters don't seem to understand what defines victory. Hezbollah and Hamas were victorious because they endured the best Israel could throw at them, and emerged just as strong as before, in Hezbollah's case stronger. For them, victory is survival.     Many posters also justify Israeli overreaction because Hamas "started it." Hamas didn't start it. israel is just as guilty in that respect. Both sides have failed in their obligations, neither side is innocent. Further, while Israel certainly has fears about its existence, Palestinians have legitimate complaints about being driven off their land, treated as second class citizens, and being victim to Israeli settlements on the feeble remnants of their land.     Neither side is blameless, and all the attempts to say one is will just delay the peace process.|`|Zye7SfK0aa	well actually its more about elections... however they were defeated again against hamas.... they didnt achieve anything and they proved to the world that they are the terrorist ones|`|bf5084d1ec35330c95ff7b7bd883bbffaa	ROFL!  You're hilarious!  Only Hamas and Hezbollah think they defeated Israel.  The rest of the world knows they got their butts kicked.    5 Flaws in the Critiques of Israel    Below I expose the fallacious thinking that underlies these popular misperceptions and replace each one with reason and common sense applied to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.    1. THE WEAK SIDE OF THE CONFLICT IS SOMEHOW MORE MORAL OR RIGHTEOUS  This myth is perhaps the most pervasive and, at the same time, arguably the most erroneous. Much of the public feels a natural affinity toward the weak and views their cause as more deserving. As a result, this same public sides with the weak party and condemns the strong.    In sports, cheering for the weaker team (the underdog) often makes sense. A match in which the victory of the stronger team is a foregone conclusion is without suspense and no fun to watch. Dirt poor lottery winners are a more satisfying outcome than a multi-millionaire who holds the winning ticket.    However, the weaker side of an international conflict is not inherently the more worthy, moral or deserving claimant.     2. A SIMPLE COUNT OF THE NUMBER OF VICTIMS  The number of victims on each side of the conflict makes headlines. It is a simple enough summary statistic to fit into a headline and everyone can understand it. Yet it is an annoyingly simplistic number that masks more meaningful measures and, worse still, distorts incentives. First, a total body count does not categorize the number of victims by terrorists, soldiers and civilians. The extermination of a terrorist just about to detonate an explosive device in a crowded area or launch a rocket aimed at an urban center would be considered a blessing in most folks' accounting.    Second, counting bodies encourages ruthless regimes that care little for their people to make no effort to protect them. More perverse still, the public's reliance on this misleading statistic encourages Hamas to place Palestinian men, women and children in the line of fire. Aware that inflated victim tallies draw public outrage, Hamas and the Hezbollah are infamous for launching their missiles at Israel from local schools and crowded residential neighborhoods and placing children on rooftops of building in which Hamas operatives hide. In this way, any attempt to take out the rocket launcher or the operatives ensures civilian casualties.    On a more basic level, counting victims ignores entirely who initiated the conflict and who are the good guys and the bad guys. No one would think it unjust or recoil upon learning that 5.5 million Nazi soldiers died in World War II compared to fewer than 500,000 British soldiers and civilians.    3. DISPROPORTIONATE FORCE  Israel is regularly charged with exercising disproportionate force in response to its enemies' terrorist attacks. I truly don't have the faintest idea how to deter terrorism without relying on "disproportionate force" either in the quality or quantity of the response.    Criminal law operates on the basis that to deter crime the punishment must exceed the criminal's benefit from the crime; otherwise, crime pays. Deterrence of terrorism is no different. To induce Hamas terrorists to end their attacks on Israel, the cost the terrorists incur must exceed their benefit from successful terrorist operations.     4. CYCLE OF VIOLENCE  Critics charge Israel with perpetuating the cycle of violence whenever Israel responds to terrorism or a flagrant violation of its sovereignty. These critics apparently anticipate Israel to take it on the chin. Against a terrorist organization whose declared and revealed mission is to achieve your elimination, taking it on the chin is not a viable long-term strategy.    The implied message permeating the cycle of violence argument is that whenever Israel defends itself, it is to blame for entering a spiral of interminable death and destruction. Yet Israel's peace with Jordan and Egypt shows that the cycle of violence can be broken. These two Muslim nations ended the cycle of violence with Israel when their leadership accepted the fact that Israel exists and abandoned the Arab mantra of "pushing Israel into the sea". Only when the Palestinian people demand of their leadership to recognize and respect Israel will the cycle of violence stop.    5. GENOCIDE  This charge is a red flag. Anyone who claims that Israel is or has in any of its previous conflicts attempted genocide is either ignorant of the meaning of the word  direct them to a dictionary and point out that Hamas' targeting of densely populated civilian centers does fit the definition  or hopelessly full of hate and a toxic ideology directed at Israel. Don't waste your time trying to change this person's mind. No amount of logic, reasoning or facts will succeed.  Your opponent only continues to rely on bombastic claims, loaded words, slogans and personal epithets.    This is a justified war and I hope that Israel sees it through until Hamas is removed from power. My own criticism of Israel (about which I've also written at length in the past) is that this initiative comes nearly four years too late.     In 2005, Israel uprooted its remaining settlements in the Gaza Strip and turned over Gaza's keys to the Palestinians. Notwithstanding, within hours of Israel's complete withdrawal, Palestinian rockets continued to land on sovereign Israeli land. Israel ignored the rocket fire. Not surprisingly, the rocket fire continued unabated until, more than 3,000 Kassam rockets PER YEAR later, the government decided that too many was enough.    Israel's mistake was not to respond to the very first rocket. Its lack of response encouraged the next 10,045-plus rockets. Terrorism, like any other behavior, only exists because it is tolerated.|`|NTWZ4rBsaa	well i think Israel should stop bombing innocent people and go to Hamas wow i can't believe me and this guy named mohanned are the only ones in the 5th grade who know about it.|`|5yuZwOLQaa	No, they had been attacked with mortars for months and decided enough is enough.

Maybe you should think twice before shooting rockets at one of the most sophisticated and well trained militaries in the world|`|AA10405801	Israel was not defeated in Lebanon.

At the end of the day, one of two things will happen.      1. Israel will will settle with it's neighbors, set up it's Jewish State and live in relative peace with its neighbors.    2. Israel will continue to play this game while the Arab and Christian Palestinian population contiues to grow the Jews will become a smaller and smaller minority and the notion of a Jewish state becomes completely untenable because of the demographics. At that point you are looking at a single state solution and all of palestine will be under a single Secular Republic where all citizens, regardless of religion, are protected by the same laws and have the same rights guaranteed under a constitution.    Gary D.    WOW 3000 Kassam rockets a year -- and what were the casualities inflicted?      Ten - Fifteen people Injured -- One death .... Tell me do these Kassam Rockets have a little stick taped to them that you put into a bottle before lighting the wick?
5zBEU99kaa	Too early to tell.

This country will never be the same after the smoke and mirrors are gone and the majority sees that when they vote in their best interest they get what is in their best interest. Anarcho capitalism will be doomed after democrats pass universal health care legislation (I'm talking about the real thing, not the watered down and doomed hybrid that makes insurance ceo's rich and is only being presented to try to keep southerners clinging to their guns and religion somewhat appeased) there is no going back to the social darwinist ways of the current republican party. After the democrats sink into complete corruption from being the dominant party for the next several presidential swings, the republican party will come back to power as a much more liberal, moderated capitalist party (with real morals!) and keep us in check. Thank darwin. But the trend will always be towards a a civilized society- the one that the left has to fight tooth and nail for decade after decade.

Alaskkan: you must buy your Kool-aid in bulk. you know wholesale wouldn't be possible if it weren't for the competitive nature of capitalism. don't worry, take back another gallon and all will be right with the world.    your mistake is that you think the only benefit of capitalism is wealth. The fact that I can go to a shell station and get gas cheaper than I could at a exxon, is a benefit of capitalism. the fact that I can buy an american standard stratocaster for 1000 dollars online rather than 1400 dollars in a store is a benefit of capitalism. the fact that I can buy the food lion brand of bread for 2.89 rather than the wonder brand for 3.19 is a benefit of capitalism. competitive prices help people from all socio-economic levels. its not just a rich or poor thing. you lack understanding of the system. look up the business cycle and circular economic flow of money and you'll know better.|`|ZOXoPgJbaa	otto do you understand why the booms and the busts happen. Its because of the federal reserve through the manipulation of interest rates . Please read up on the austrian business cycle theory to get a better understanding of what I am talking about. If interest rates stayed at market equilibrium booms and busts would not occur.    Otto before 1913 when we had a federal reserve there was somewhat of a free market, but even before that we had national banks. From the 1840's when Jackson slayed the central bank to the early 1860's is really when we have had a real free market.    You people dont understand. In real capitalism, which we havent seen in some time, the gap between the rich and the poor narrows. This is a fact!    Otto that is a strawmans argument you are pointing out.

Alan Greenspan admitted he was wrong in his efforts of "stabilizing" the economy and probably did more harm than good.        After all, when you start doing those things -- it's not exactly free-market capitalism.    Some regulation?  Yes.  Lots of oversight?  Yes.  ==============================  Alaskkan:  The poor get rich?    Hmm...I wonder if every rich man was always a rich man.  From what I understand about Buffet is he shared a 1 room house with his whole family growing up.      If you want it -- the opportunity is there...the question is are you willing to EARN it?  If not -- step aside...b/c you're holding up the line.  ======================================...  Otto you wrote - "not having children working sweatshops for next to nothing to provide our cheap goods. not having our own people working on terrible wages and below the poverty line. thatd be a start"    What don't you understand about the exchange rate and the Purchasing Power Parity?  Do you know you can rent the finest hotel room on the one of the most beautiful beaches in the world in Thailand for $1.00?  Yes...one U.S. dollar.

They may not be the best jobs -- but they provide an income to a people that would otherwise be ______________.  You can fill in the blank.    I also wonder how many outfits from Gap you own -- or products from WalMart -- or from Target -- or what kind of shoes you might be wearing as you type in your tower.  ======================================...  Is it capitalism you hate -- or is it the unethical businessman?  ______________________________________...  The divide where only the few have benefited?      I don't know if you're driving around with your eyes closed but there a millions upon millions of people who have benefited.  They have houses -- drive nice cars -- send their kids to college -- eat out on the town -- go to movies -- take nice vacations.      I think you're diluted man -- you've bought into this top 1% junk that makes it sound like if you're not in the top 1%, you're broke and struggling.      You know what distinguishes the rich from everyone else?  They spend on only what they need -- and they prepare themselves by networking, preparing, challenging themselves on a daily basis.  What people see and concentrate on is the fruits of that labor when they've made their money (working their asses off) and are enjoying what they EARNED.

Ron Paul adopted the position that government should follow the spirit of the intent of the framers of the Constitution, which included, among other things, no foreign wars or entanglements.  Instead now we have presidents who seem to think it is our obligation to attack and invade other countries, which is the exact opposite view of the founding fathers.  Ron Paul was echoing their sentiments, so of course they would have supported him.    I voted for him, even though he was not on the ballot and had zero chance of anything; it was more a personal statement.  I cannot see supporting egomaniacs who seek to run the country into the ground by dragging it down the wrong path and then throwing it over a cliff.    Footnote:  It is amazing that some answerers to this question seem to think you would have no idea what the founders thought; yet it was a matter of historical record that  the key figures of the day were against foreign wars and overseas military adventures.  Those who answer this way have no knowledge of the history of the times.  As a matter of fact, the opposition to foreign wars and sending troops overseas was so strong that it took years for Congress to react to the terrorism and piracy that claimed American shipping along the North African Coast.  It was this terrorism and piracy that gave impetus to the Constitutional Convention, because the threat had to be met with a naval force, and a federal set of laws was needed to raise a national army.    The first Muslim terrorist attack on the US was not the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center, but the attacks of the Barbary Pirates and the hijacking of American ships and the kidnapping of American sailors in the 1770s.|`|kKdUhS2gaa	yes dr. paul was the only real candidate|`|AA12041364	No I think they would have raised an army and attacked washington.

Yes - just as some Dems would accuse him of shoving his religion down everyone's throats.    - - -     It's hard to transfer what Jesus taught in that day to present times, politically speaking.    Example; Because he saved the woman caught in the act of adultery, does that mean he would be against ALL death penalty cases?    And, if you noticed, while he saved her, he didn't back down on saying she was wrong. ("Go & sin no more.") I can imagine liberals screaming, "Who are you telling her what to do with her own body!"    He obviously wanted the poor to be taken care of, but does that mean he would have wanted the government to be in charge of it? And 50% of the rich man's income being confiscated to pay for it? That sounds more like Robin Hood than Jesus Christ!    He said you have to pay your taxes, but would he have voted for a politician who advocated fixing things by higher taxes?    He taught obedience to the government, but does that mean he wanted a big government?    I can't imagine Jesus being anything but disgusted by mid to late- term abortions, but the Bible is not specific on the subject. The issue of "when life begins" would have to be answered, first.    But as far as issues like trade unions and strong regulation of business, strong environmental regulations, animal rights & gun control, it's hard to say, exactly
0qVt0IZWaa	Your ex's child support obligation continues until he petitions the court and wins a downward modification.  He would have to prove the inability to find the same kind of job or one that pays similar income.

In the meantime, start looking for ways you can reduce spending.  The relationship you both have with the children is more important than the $$$.|`|Kz86NcLtaa	First -- don't listen to the first guy that answered.  It's easier to judge people then help -- so, don't listen to him.   I'm almost in the same boat -- my future ex has gotten a pay decrease .. and he might loose his job as well.  From what I've learned about child support -- they base that on what the father makes.  So, unfortuntately it sounds like it would be decreased. But, if he's lost his job then he would more then likely selling off some things to help himself out.  You should let child services know .. because if he gets any money from selling things your kids might be entitled to that. You should see if there's any state assistance that you can apply for.  Good luck --|`|03jyHXXlaa	He will still have to pay and the amount will add up.  Depending on your state he may lose his drivers license, property and bank accounts can be frozen and warrants can be issued for arrest.  Williams comment if just an exampe of dead beat dads.  The support is not for you its for your children that are just as much his as yours and he should contribute as you do.  Comments like Williams just goes to show you that some men would rather spend money on their w***e of the week instead of their children.  Dont listen to him.
fbe600962a1348933b552a6e772b27b2aa	People generally mirror each other's sentiments. She must be hating people. Logically.
AA10439016	Of course.  Anyone who says otherwise is not worthy of having a child or a family.    Indiscriminate torturing is a useless endeavor and does nothing but turn people against the torturer, whether it be a person or nation.    But carefully directed torture towards an individual with knowledge of a specific event or threat is a useful and necessary tool.    There is a world of difference between torture for sadistic pleasure and torture to extract information to save innocent lives.  Liberals are either too stupid to understand this or too scare to stand up for themselves.  Either way, they should get out of the way when there is fighting to be done.      Remember, as George Orwell stated, "Good people sleep peacefully in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf."|`|f9crUDTwaa	What has this question got to do with the government?|`|XtDigWAlaa	Yes.

I wouldn't torture someone who was an accomplice and actually didn't know where the victim(s) currently were.   Which is where the law and ethics of it comes into play.  Knowing and thinking are two different things.   Due process provides every criminal the right to a fair trial, to be judged by a jury of his peers, and proven guilty beyond shadow of a doubt before he should be tortured for information.  He/She's only a suspect up until that point.|`|koQ8H19Zaa	yeah i would torture him. make him watch spongebob for 24 hours that should crack him right open|`|KMASS2Gmaa	Legally you can not do so. Ethically I personally think persons who let the kidnapped die due to the suspects civil rights are as guilty as the kidnapper.    I am no longer a Fed LEO because I personally believe a person involved with an ongoing felony has no protection under the law. If you are actively breaking the law you have no protection by the law.     Once they are not actively involved in breaking the law then they are just like anyone else and deserve full civil rights. With one major exception, If you shoot at the cops until your weapons run dry then throw it down and raise your hands they should shoot you dead. No trial, No Judge, No Jury. No escape.    Since I no longer get paid to deal with people in the process of committing felonies they better not cross my path.  By committing a felony in my presence you place my life in immediate jeopardy therefore you get two rounds to center of mass and one to the head. Just like they taught us during Officer Survival School for Boarding Officers in the US Coast Guard!|`|GmPIU2MNaa	If i was 100% sure..  Then yes i think ^^,|`|DVB8XhCBaa	Yes.

I begged & begged & begged but he was having none of it, & he took sincere pleasure in screwing me over when he issued me that ticket. I almost had to go to court because I couldnt afford to pay the fine. A sense of glee is an understatement from what I saw. They remind me of minny Hitlers, people who were bullied at school & just want revenge on the rest of society who they blame for what happened to them. Their definitely an obnoxious breed anyway, very self righteous, decrepit & parasitic. If they werent traffic wardens they would be one of these coppers that sit behind those mobile speed cameras all day catching people speeding in zones that arent clearly marked with speed limits. & argue belligerently in defence of what they are doing when someone questions their morals. In other words they are in that job to enable them to get one over on the normal people in life who are just trying to go about their daily lives, because they know that is what they will never be....normal people.|`|1P8TS1ggaa	Absolutely !

For instance, the Royal Air Force (established over 90yrs ago, making it one of the world's oldest)....   They've got what's regarded as the world's best Aerobatics team, "The Red Arrows": http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbGO1BBWt...

One story about them worthy of note is what miltary historians consider "The greatest raid of all time"... the Raid on St. Nazaire on Nazi occupied France, to destroy a heavily fortified dry dock (the only one on the atlantic coast capable of holding a HUGE German naval ship) by ramming a ship packed with explosives into it, then jumping on shore to blow things up (despite being hugely outnumbered):  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgF0R4dhU...

They have their own problems, but a weak American economy compounds those issues.  Also your friend seems to have forgotten the American Revolution.

Granted, most countries are in trouble, but Britain is especially bad.  They are running out of oil in the North Sea and they are losing a lot of finance jobs to Asian nations.  Those are their biggest revenue sources and if lost, would devastate their nation.  Short term they are fine, long term... I wouldn't bet on them.
VKrePQZqaa	Of course he gonna think that because hes proud of where he comes from. However the US Military is the most powerful military in the world, if you combined the entire EU. The United States still spends close to double of what they spend on defense. As far as Economy we have the strongest economy in the world. Americans rank in the top 10 as far a money per person. Most Europeans countries aren't nearly the close. So honestly the US has many advantages over a majority of other countries.

DTSUJe2oaa	A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation that pays returns to investors out of the money paid by subsequent investors rather than from profit. The term, "Ponzi scheme," is used primarily in the United States, while other English-speaking countries do not distinguish colloquially between this scheme and other pyramid schemes.[1]    The Ponzi scheme usually offers abnormally high short-term returns in order to entice new investors. The perpetuation of the high returns that a Ponzi scheme advertises and pays requires an ever-increasing flow of money from investors in order to keep the scheme going.    The system is destined to collapse because the earnings, if any, are less than the payments. Usually, the scheme is interrupted by legal authorities before it collapses because a Ponzi scheme is suspected or because the promoter is selling unregistered securities. As more investors become involved, the likelihood of the scheme coming to the attention of authorities increases. In most recent "Ponzi" schemes, Bernard Madoff stole an estimated $50 billion dollars of investors money and another scheme recently surfaced at the sum of $400 million dollars with ties to the Italian Mob. In another incident Nicholas Cosmo was arrested on January 26, 2009 on charges of an estimated $370-400 million Ponzi scheme using his company Agape World Inc. in Hauppauge, New York.    The scheme is named after Charles Ponzi,[2] who became notorious for using the technique after emigrating from Italy to the United States in 1903. Ponzi did not invent the scheme, but his operation took in so much money that it was the first to become known throughout the United States. His original scheme was in theory based on arbitraging international reply coupons for postage stamps, but soon diverted investors' money to support payments to earlier investors and Ponzi's personal wealth. Charles Dickens' 1844 novel Martin Chuzzlewitt described a Ponzi scheme decades before Ponzi was born.    Knowingly entering a Ponzi scheme, even at the last round of the scheme, can be rational in the economic sense if a government will likely bail out those participating in the Ponzi scheme.~|`|QYDYX9B7aa	Knowledge hurts but the truth also heals:    This guy is like an Adolf of money. He is a mad adolf.    Basically he started out by asking his friend for a loan of money. He used up the money and asked another friend for a larger loan. He used this money to fill in the previous loan with the previous person AND use up the rest. Another friend, bigger loan to pay off previous loan and use up the rest. He kept doing this with multiple people until he reached $500 billion in debt. Due to the sheer force of such a large sum of money, he is rich from controlling it and investing it but the discovery was this illegal practice he was using to trick people into lending him money. When he got caught, the loans came crashing down and everyone who invested to him went bankrupt! Talk about $500 billion! Like 500,000 households gone bankrupt.    This is the kind of scam artist that gets away with it afterwards too because he already has a lot of money and a lot of connections.    This is the kind of guy the death penalty should be reserved for.|`|neuprBeGaa	A Ponzi scheme is where the con artist gets a few people to invest in something - a business, the futures market, foreign exchange - the details aren't important to the scheme, because the money isn't really going there anyway.    The con artist takes that money, keeps it, then pays an enormous dividend back to his few initial investors.  They, of course, are very impressed - they leave their "investment" with the scammer, and tell their friends about this wonderful investment.  The friends add their money to the fund, and pass on the news to more people.    As more and more people invest, the scammer can use part of the incoming money to pay "dividends" to the first few investors, while skimming the rest off for himself.  The longer the scheme runs, the more investors he has, the more money he has to keep up the scheme.  Eventually, of course, he stops getting new investors, new money.  At that point, he takes whatever is left and skips town.    Madoff was a legitimate investment broker who used his reputation to start such a scheme.  His name was good enough to fool some very influential people into investing.  Their influence, then, caused even more people to join in, even financial professionals and banks that should have known better.  When the public saw these experts giving Madoff their money, well, that was even more "proof" that it was a good deal.  So the scheme expanded well beyond any other Ponzi scheme yet known.    But eventually, like all cons, it all came crashing down.|`|Z0QvOIH0aa	Ponzi is the last name of a person who many years ago cheated investors. Madoff told everybody that his investments would earn them a whole lot of money   much more than the average investment. So everybody invested with him. But, he never invested the money. When people decided to cash out, he paid off old investors with money from new investors. That's a Ponzi scheme. 50 billion dollars were lost by various people (individual investors) and by pension funds owned by teacher organizations and county employees and whatnot. A lot of people and groups lost EVERYTHING they had. They invested only with him, and they will never see that money again. It wasn't insured. It's gone.
Vc5Nnxeuaa	If you mean that you didn't have those problems and your recruiter said you did, he "can," but shouldn't. Do you want to be discharged or is he being a d***? If you want to be discharged, then just go with it. If he's a d***, then contact his superior and let them know. Can it affect you future? Well, it certainly won't help.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	He can say that, but the paperwork likely won't reflect that.  An uncharacterized discharge for just quitting looks really good on an application for law enforcement which is very popular amongst former service members.  You'll be really popular.
dPLkNRNuaa	Most of the stuff in your question does not mean anything is wrong.    1. Air Bags: deploy because of sudden deceleration. There is a module in the car (under the driver seat) and sensors in the front of the car. When the sensors detect a sudden deceleration - they send a signal to the module. It decides if the air bag needed to be deployed. Air Bags are not soft cushy things. They deploy at 200+ miles per hour. Would having that come hurtling at your mothers head have been a good thing in this situation? Probably not.     2. so your mother sat up on they way to the hospital.  Did sitting up cause her any injury? From your question....no.     3.  So she walked inside. Did walking inside cause any additional injury? From your question....no.  Apparently your mother was not hurt that bad. (and that's a good thing).     4. moving your mother with a neck brace: would it have been better to move her with out it? Leaving your mother in the wrecked car indefinitely is not an option. She's gotta move sometime. Moving her with a neck brace on would just be a precaution.  Again....don't see where that caused her any injury.     5. Does your mother pay for a subscription to On Star? It's not free. It does not come on just because you had a wreck. You have to subscribe to the service.     In short.....from your question....most of your concerns are non-issues.    EDIT: since you have a subscription to On Star. It may be that the On Star system does not detect a crash unless the air bags deploy. It may be that the On Star system is tied to the air bag module. Since this accident was not the type to trigger an air bag deployment....On Star was not activated.    As far as hiring a lawyer goes.....a lawyer is not going to sue On Star, GM or the ambulance company. You can't sue for what "could have", "might have" or "maybe could have" happened. Only what did happen. Since your mother was not injured by walking into the hospital or sitting up right in an ambulance their is no law suit.  If your mother was at fault for the accident....there is not much a lawyer can do for your. If your mother is not at a fault...all a lawyer will do is pursue the at fault drivers insurance policy.|`|AA12109395	I'm afraid to answer your question, your mom might sue me.|`|5dRvtaGgaa	Did you call the police after this accident happened?

As I advise many on legal forums in Australia...the first cab of the rank for anyone when they are involved with the police (and this will apply as well in the USA) is to obtain under Freedom of Information (I am presuming you have such legislation in the USA) the police report of the matter. In it you will see the circumstances under which the police acted.....and most of all whether they acted legally. Then scrutinise the report..and anything you do not understand...(well here in Australia there are free neighborhood legal advice centres...perhaps similiarly in the USA?) go and see a free legal centre..should they exist.

uvWH4Ioyaa	You can not serve a search warrant until you obtain a search warrant.  You can obtain one only if you are a certified law enforcement officer after appearing before an independent magistrate (usually a judge) and provide an affidavit under oath with supplemental sworn testimony, if requested,  The affidavit and statements under oath must provide evidence of probable cause regarding illegal conduct, contraband or other indicia of crime, giving a proper description of the persons, places and objects to be searched.  The Judge or Magistrate then authorizes the search warrant which is served by the law enforcement officer. After the search the officer must file a "return" with the court indicating when, where and what was seized during the search.|`|AA10206116	Normally, they would knock on the door, show you the warrant, then walk in and hope for your cooperation so they'll leave as soon as possible.

owzmt7lDaa	IF you are in any country in the world except the US you can leave home if you are over 16 with no strings attached unless you are deemed to be mentally handicapped or insane. OR unless you're parents of the elite.<br>  <br>  If you are in a non-English speaking country there isn't even a minimum age most of the time. Unless you're parents of the elite...<br>  <br>  Generally you can leave at 17 in some states, 18 in most, however if you are employed, can support yourself and you are of working age (16) then you should be able to afford residence. If you are signed out of school, you will have no liability, as you have committed no crime.<br>  <br>  If you are still in school it is tricky, especially since your working hours will be limited.|`|mYp3SSxkaa	Her guardians can prevent that from happen - they're called guardians because they're supposed to "guard" her from any problems and take care of her. They might not do anything, plenty of kids leave home before 18 without a single thought from their parents or guardians, but the guardians do have the ability to prevent it. Your friend could see a lawyer and become legally emancipated from the guardians, in which case she would be legally an adult even though she isn't yet 18. But that would require her to take care of herself from now on, which can be hard for anyone.|`|b8svqAMAaa	If she moves out before she becomes 18 and is not an emancipated minor, her guardians can report her as a runaway.  She needs to realize that if someone, such as her guardians, are nice enough to provide her with a home she should respect them enough to follow the rules.  I wouldn't call them mom and dad if I didn't feel comfortable.  If she is calling them by their first names, perhaps she should do whatever she can to avoid having to do so.  If that is a rule in their home, it is a bad one.  You can't expect someone to call you that just because you want them to.  If she can hang in there until she is 18 then she can do what ever she wants.  Since they are her guardians then they are responsible for what happens to her.  They can't just be okay with her leaving.  If she is a ward of the court, then she needs to see what she can do about getting relocated to another family for now.  It doesn't sound too bad, except for the fact that she does not want to abide by the rules.  As long as they are not beating her or molesting her she should try to just stick it out and wait til she can legally be on her own.<br>  <br>  **To become emancipated she needs to be able to prove that she can care for herself.  Meaning, she needs to have a job and a place to stay, food to eat and all that other stuff that comes along with being a responsible adult.
Vanf51Pzaa	You will only have fulfilled the residence requirement if you can show that you were not just in the UK for your studies. Being in a country as a student only does not 'count' as being resident.  For instance, you will need to show that you did not go home for the school holidays and that you had year round accommodation.    They will ask to see your residence and travel history so make sure you have that, they do cross check with the airlines.    They will also need to see that you intend to remain - for instance a job or job offer.    So if you qualify, go to the website here  http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/ukresi...  and look at the instructions.

It would be in our best interest to militarize the border (have it be a real life training mission for our future soldiers) and provide more support to Mexico in order to crush the cartels.  In the long run, the only way to effect change, is for Mexico to have some reforms and rid itself of the corruption in government.

How couples handle money varies wildly; some keep finances separate and divvy up who is responsible for what bills, and some pool their finances and agree how they'll save or spend from their joint accounts.  It sounds like your parents are a "separate accounts" couple, but it also sounds like your father is using the finances to try to control your mother.   It may be that he doesn't value what she does; it may be that he takes her for granted; it may be that she indeed doesn't do much and he has a valid reason for resentment.  I don't know.  <br>  <br>  There is no legal "you must share your money" basis in marriage, only in some divorces (such as post-divorce child support or alimony).  How couples share their money while married is up to them.  It sounds like they have bigger issues than just finances, though.|`|9QeV07zJaa	A few thought about this, I hope something helps:<br>  <br>  I think you should talk to your dad about his not your mom.

If she doesn't have any, this would be an indicator that there is a control issue, but I caution you ton consider the whole picture and find out what your Dad's perspective is.|`|fAaLjlI0aa	Your mom basically has two choices. She can go out and get a job, and keep all of the money in a safe place. Or, depending on what state you live in, she can divorce him and be entitled to half of what he has.

Maybe you all should stage an intervention with him, let him know how his controlling and tight-fisted ways are tearing apart your family and that you will all leave him if he doesn't start acting like a man instead of a greedy controlling miser.|`|peeNituyaa	When you are married, there are certain things you are entitled to but sharing a bank account is not one of them.  I don't agree with the way your father is treating your mom but that is the way it use to be done in the old days.  Sad but true because the man was the provider and the woman stayed home.  There were no laws against it then and just because perception has changed, there are no laws now.  The only way she would be entitled legally is to get a divorce.  Good luck.

Also bear in mind alot of these people aren't particually well educated either....     In times like these we shouldnt blame immigrant workers who are only trying to make ends meet.

We need to stand together and confront the BRITISH companies who are employing these people.|`|kpcJNDtLaa	Tell your Indian pal that if the BNP come to power he will be going home.    I would vote for the BNP mainly because i think British jobs should go to British workers and to keep Britain safe from the muslims who are all baying for our blood.    I am Scottish and we don't get many blacks or muslims up where i stay, mainly Chinese and Indian people who i have no problem with and happen to get on very well with.    Is it any wonder that the British people are turning to the BNP when gangs of black kids run riot around London with swords and guns killing each other or when gangs of muslims want to bomb us and impose sharia law or when British people can't get jobs because of all the foreigners here or when you can't get a bed in the hospital or your kid a place in the local school because it's full of blacks or muslims who cause nothing but trouble or when murderers and rapists get nothing but a slap on the wrists.    Someday there are going to be riots in this country because of all the immigrants.    I'm only 17 but i have known that i would vote BNP since i was about fifteen but that's not without a loss.  I'm gay and i believe that is a practise that the BNP would like to outlaw.

And forgive me, but since models are generally not endowed with enormous brains I'd cheerfully disregard anything she's said.    The BNP make far right Conservatives look like left wing Communist sympathisers. Whilst some of their policies do appear to be decent, those policies are lifted directly from other more mainstream parties manifestos. The less palatable ones (deporting all illegal immigrants summarily, encouraging those immigrants here legally to leave) are both illegal under European Law, which they would be part of if, albeit highly unlikely, as Euro MP's. Funny that a party so virulently anti European should be after European seats. Could that be because they've realised they'll never get one in any UK constituency?    These anti immigration policies are not entirely surprising, given that their oft heard call is to put white British people first... good for a laugh, that one, how far back do you have to go to prove white British, for example... is a BNP staple diet. But not only is it nonsense, it is uncosted nonsense and there is no way on the planet that the BNP have the slightest clue how much any of this will cost.     They also campaigned at the last general election on a return to national service; something that is horrendously expensive and deeply unpopular with the Armed Forces. The expense was one of the reasons it was binned in the first place.    The BNP do not have a clue what this country needs. They campaign in areas where they are most likely to find sympathisers, so you don't find them doing much in most of England and in Scotland, well, they're about as popular as syphilis. The BNP and socialist areas do not mix and never will. As far as Scotland is concerned, the BNP couldn't even get a seat by standing in every single constituency which was elected by proportional representation for the Scottish Parliament. They polled less than 1.5% in every single seat, in some not even half that.|`|98JZcrO6aa	I don't think i would vote BNP. Mostly, i dont have a problem with immigrants in particular, the main concern i have is the people who are living off benefits and not being asked to work. Although there are quite a few immigrants living off benefits, there are white british people doing the same thing as well.     Also, the majority of people running the health service are immigrants from other countries, these people i like because our NHS would be ruined if all immigrants are deported. British people don't want to become doctors, the majority of them want to work in finance. As long as these immigrants do the jobs that British people dont want, i am totally for them to stay.       In a country where there aren't enough children being born to replace the parents and grandparents before them, we kind of need immigrants to keep our population stable so there are enough people working so Oldpeople can get a pension. If there are more old people than working people, where will we get the money from to pay their pensions?    According to the BNP Manifesto on Page 11 it explains that the BNP "would restore to the legitimate and law-abiding sportmen the right to possess and shoot all the varieties of weapon"    I dont want a government that gives the people the right to own and possess a gun. I thought the USA was having a huge problem with guns, i hope the UK dosent turn to this    "they will increase funding of existing border controls by 500%" (page 13), And that is coming out of which taxpayer's money?

The republican congress under Bill Clinton did deliver Bush 43 a recession.  Bush pulled us out of the recession without a stimulous package.  BUT without the balance of power congress shifted to the center and walked away from traditional conservative principals.  They increased the debt substantially over any other administration, thus they gave up both the house and senate.  If you remember.  Clinton won a totally democratic congress his first two years, and without the balance of power, he lost it in two years.  Obomaites, will soon be awakened from their disallusion.|`|NP6ES2GPaa	Yes, you are generally right, but you forget the tech bubble in 2001.    You will notice that through out history, economic hardships and booms result in changes in election patterns. During economic hardships, democrats and liberal Republicans are elected. During economic booms, Republicans and conservative Democrats are elected.    Example -  Gilded Age & Post Civil War - Radical Republicans and Republican Pres  WWI and Early Century Recessions - Progressive Presidents, Wilson Roosevelt  Roaring Twenties - Republican Pres and Congressional Rep  WWII, Great Depression through Vietnam - Liberal Pres. like FDR, Nixon and LBJ  Tech Boom - Conservatives Reagan, (more cons.)

KHhbO3rxaa	Since it's only an essay that you're writing, and not a document which has to withstand cross examination in court, you don't need to get facts verified very much do you?<br>  Generally speaking, it's common knowledge that most crime is committed by youngsters, teenagers mainly.  Most of it utterly brainless, and easily detected.  Which is why prisons are jam-packed full of young idiots who think they're smarter than the cops.  By the time most people reach maturity they realise that prison is very unpleasant, so they stay out of criminal activity.<br>    A very worrying feature of late is very young criminals, often pre-pubertal, which brings to their behaviour a complete lack of understanding of consequences.  Parental control is usually lacking here, and courts  and police are hamstrung in taking any kind of punitive action against children.<br>   As to stating a percentage, why insist upon that, when a simple juggling of words will get across the message as I've just written it....you're not the Chief Constable, are you?
lMKy9Ho8aa	no!!|`|aV3bFchtaa	Yes, among other lunatic programs.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Nope, just family planning, which DOES NOT include abortions. Now, NGO's can discuss a variety of options for women, AND provide contraceptives and counseling......where, before, they weren't allowed to do so if the word or idea of abortion ever came up in conversation. Further, ALL of these NGO's were denied contraceptives, resulting in MORE unwanted pregnancies and STD's/AIDS.|`|oVmGcRVtaa	No we are not.|`|7ZJHBKk9aa	Yes we are and I do mean we.

He did it on 21 Jan the anniversary of Roe v Wade.    Much of the 335,000,000 will go to Planned Parenthood -- and they who built their clients in poor areas will tacitly encourage abortions.    To the person who quipped $50 now versus $50,000 later.  Why not ask the same question for your parents 50 cents now to save 100,000 of medical care later.  (50 cents = 1 9mm round retail).   Is there a moral difference?

Your ability to attack people in debt is there own fault do you want to get rid of freedom? People want to live above there means and Clinton had policies helping them that was bound to pop.

It has gotten to the point that if you watch the nightly use there is no reason to watch the same thing again on Inside Edition.  I have basic cable and and find very little world news to watch.    I think that health care cost and education cost in our country is a mess.  We have to have them to make it; but, we do not have the money to pay for them.  Doctors and Dentist have to charge huge fees to pay their school loans and the insurance companies spend most of their time trying to sell insurance or trying to get out of paying it.    What a mess!  I have talked to people, from other countries, who had their medical cost paid for.  They complained because of having to wait months to see a doctor and of the poor quality of care they received.    I still have a hard time understanding how people afford all of their modern electonic gadgets.       Thanks for the quesiton.|`|DvFtOGWbaa	I totaly agree with you on this assessment . I would of said the same thing    lol|`|vbAu5SY3aa	I agree. I think Americans are kept so busy they are too tired to see the forest through the trees.

I'm very sorry to say this, but there are certainly a small minority of factions and/or individual people who are crazy enough to attempt an assassination.<br>  <br>  However, the Secret Service is very good at what they do.

ucYwexwJaa	If it's as you state it is, it's a misunderstanding.  I would wonder why you would wait so long (60 days) to report the address change, and it's your responsibility to keep the DMV updated as to your correct address, as well as your local post office.  It's always good to have turned yourself in rather than being drug in via arrest, so kudos for doing that.  Ask your attorney what you need to do to get this off of your record, if that's even possible.|`|FplTPoAyaa	You wouldn't be arrested for a failure to appear for a traffic violation.  Only if the violation were a criminal offense, or you were subpoenaed to court.

Get the paperwork together (proof of change of address, date, time)  along with possibly a written statement from the Postal Inspector who covers your mail route. You paid off your ticket, we all get tickets and moving violations are not criminal, they are moving violations that can affect your driving record and insurance rates.  TALK TO YOUR ATTORNEY and see if he can get this expunged if it does go on your record as a traffic misdemeanor or see if he can just get it off totally due to your proof.  You'll do fine, take care.|`|peeNituyaa	If I do not get mail for 3 days, I am at the Post Office wondering what is going on.  You let it go on for 2 months?  That to me was your first mistake.  Second was when you get a ticket and have to appear in court, you can't just pay the fine and not show up. They are not giving you a choice.  As a matter of fact, if I recall correctly, how could you know what to pay since the purpose of going to court is for the Judge to determine what to pay and or jail time for you to get.  So how did you pay it but not show up in court?  How did you know what to pay?  Most misunderstandings are situations that people fail to take care of in the first place.  I could be wrong but it seems like you brought this on yourself.

P6NptCz8aa	Yes, it is patriotic. Patriotism is doing justice for one's country, not one's president. Just because Obama is president does not mean that he IS America, he's just president for four years, and only four years.|`|5ff6c450a0786035aba431374bf6fc0aaa	it's not so patriotic when you want to impeach the president for no reason.  <br>  <br>  What crimes has he committed (that can be backed up by factual evidence)?|`|VIhj7ghUaa	Whatever.  It doesn't make you any less of an a—never mind.|`|hiCSVwchaa	In a way, it isn't patriotic, since Obama has done nothing that is impeachable, so in a way, you're arguing for the Constitution to be changed so that presidents can be impeached merely for passing legislation and holding views that you don't agree with.<br>  <br>  But, I support your First Amendment right to put any silly sticker on your car.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	Who did Obama kill? Did he start a war or ruin an economy? You are just going to look like an idiot if you do that kind of stuff so please do cause people like me love to see who the weirdos are with great ease. I wish you & the 11% of the country who agree with you would all wear signs to show who you are. As a matter of fact I think a good use of your time would be to get others to join you. Maybe you can market something you wear on your sleeve that say Impeach a President who has done nothing impeachable or just I am an idiot whatever I say go for it.|`|oojO4WAraa	Yes, and you will be hearing that political dissent is patriotic for the next 8 years, and even beyond that.  <br>  <br>  I saw plenty of "Impeach Bush" bumper stickers the past few years.  And I never once questioned their patriotism - and I wouldn't question yours either.|`|IG8s8UnSaa	It is your guaranteed right, my friend.

Speak to issues, not generalities, and if you really want to wow them, come up with alternate solutions.|`|gfvh5dwTaa	YES....the Liberals Dems bashed Bush at every turn from DAY 1# and of course now they said they di...LIARS<br>  <br>  They first bashed him over Gore's defeat...then really went to work|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	Times change.

But since Obama hasn't committed any impeachable crime, doesn't calling for his impeachment look a trifle loony at this point?  And I can't understand why you folks are having such a hard time giving Obama a chance.  Bush wasn't my choice, but I was willing to withhold judgement until after his ill conceived war in Iraq.|`|0cee90c25888a78a0b401efe2b753fd3aa	sure, what's fair is fair.  But what is a little ridiculous is that you guys have managed to include more dissent and "bashing" in one month than most of us had in 8 years.|`|gQYIphZtaa	we gave Bush everything he wanted in a crisis(911) and he screwed us. We behaved like Americans when those bums killed Americans and now that we are experiencing the economic equivalent, Republicans will not back the President.|`|N0iM1mo8aa	Sure is, what's good for the goose....  However, look forward to being called a racist or being told you have to "give him a chance" first.|`|C2HHfun2aa	Yes!

The Deceleration of Independence says it is our DUTY to let our government know when we do not agree with it. However that does not mean you aren't an idiot.

Standing up in a public forum and demanding accountability from your government and telling them what they are doing wrong is patriotic.|`|RFEorR5Raa	according to liberals, anyone who 'dissents' against obama is a racist, fear-monger, etc and are unpatriotic and do not want good for this nation.<br>  <br>  it is meant to silence debate, not encourage it.<br>  <br>  iberls love to compare bush to a monkey and thought it hilarious and if you google bush+monkey you get about 3 Million links on it, but the NYP published a cartoon with a monkey and the libs have gone postal.  sharpton is suing and wants an FCC investigation.  the post issued an apology, which i think is wrong, but that wasn't enough, they want annihilation of the cartoonist.  like they did in denmark.<br>  <br>  it might soon be a crime to dissent.  free speech will become a thing of the past and we all must be in lock step for Obama.<br>  <br>  resistance is futile.  keep it up!  i intend to.|`|9wrMpXRyaa	Yes, it is patriotic.<br>  <br>  However, as far as impeachment, you do not have a leg to stand on.  If we impeach him for what he has done now, which is not illegal, then we will impeach every president till hell freezes over.<br>  <br>  You seriously do not want to go there.<br>  <br>  .|`|s2QqPyZsaa	Dissent is patriotic if you base it on actual policy disagreements.  If you just don't like Obama because he's a  "Muslim," "Kenyan," "socialist," "commie" and other assorted nonsense that's is spewed out daily on Yahoo Answers, then it is just stupid "general opposition" to President Obama.|`|E6EbbZXzaa	One would have to assume that it's still the highest form of patriotism unless those same lefties are hypocrites, and I'm certain that that can't possibly be the case. <br>  <br>  Unless you're dissenting against the Wonderbringer, and then you're a racist.|`|xd7tSmQeaa	Hey if people can wear a t-shirt that shows President Bush in rifle scope sights then you are just fine.  But Libs are thin skinned so expect a lot of hissing and incoherent nonsense from them.|`|r8tpwmixaa	Absolutely. That is until the first amendment is nullified.|`|7M0KW1Iwaa	Doooooooo it!<br>  It's very patriotic|`|QvNBEDA2aa	Absolutely. This is what makes our country so great, our right to express our opinions. Lord knows we put up with plenty of anti-Bush! Go for it!
AbHm1BBXaa	one word for you....<br>  Israel.
9BcQ5XMXaa	The 20 billion dollars we give Israel is an aberration. First, it's mainly the reason why we are in conflict with muslim nations.

You have to have lived in the US at least 14 years.|`|vjfdhhSDaa	John MCcain is a natural born citizen both of his parents are U.S. citizens , he served with distinction in Vietnam in th U.S. Military. Obama is not if he were a natural born citizen he would produce the actual birth certificate and not that forgery.|`|VOccyg7daa	If by campaigning you mean can he/she run for president, the answer is no. Can he/she go out and campaign for someone running, sure.|`|hE6Z93Ysaa	Anyone can campaign, you just can't be president if you are foreign born. You have to be a natural citizen.
BwrGcTosaa	As far as I can tell, neither "party" have a clue that they are SUPPOSED to be guided in their efforts by something called the "Constitution."  I'm not sure we could find a half a dozen people in Washington that KNOW what their limits are, Constitutionally.      I think it should be REQUIRED, for anyone entering politics that they KNOW the Constitution and Bill of Rights and exactly what their role is in upholding, protecting and defending it.|`|EhoJ9mgsaa	They do not.    Big Govt. is coming as a two-headed monster.|`|XtDigWAlaa	Actually the Republicans and Libertarians are usually the ones defending the constitution from the liberals.|`|UXc6lMZBaa	No. The Democrats often support these things too, like how Obama voted for the USA PATRIOT Act. Then there is, as that person up there said, the Fairness Doctrine and gun control, and then there's that Freedom of Choice thing...|`|CowgOqXTaa	Maybe you should ask that question of our Kenyan born, Indonesian adopted, ineligible to run, President?    Richard|`|cl9Ghxrlaa	Nope.  I think violations of the Constitution are 50/50.  Both Republicans and Democrats are responsible for crapping all over it at times.|`|53216puqaa	No, they're small potatoes compared to the Dems. Now that Mr. Seele has opened the door inviting the liberal Dems to "Come in and join the Party" the republicans deserve to be abandoned, just as they abandoned us. If there lives depended on it, I wouldn't pass gas for them!|`|x5RFgh6Qaa	look at the fairness doctrine. the beliefs of many left wing politicians on gun control. apparently not.|`|wdoxxojKaa	Clinton swore to uphold it.    Look what a lying, corrupt piece of shi+ he is.|`|AA11086243	no... but the Republicans are much more flamboyant and eager to do it... and of much more fundamental freedoms...    the Republicans pushed through the patriot act and bragged about it... Dems made some changes and  passed it again much more quietly... and it was less invasive... yet still not good...    you could get Reps to sell their soul if you appealed to their patriotism and pride...|`|LFE0e8Qdaa	Republicans don't ignore or violate the Constitution, that's what liberals do by creating a label to demonize what the Constitution says but they don't like.   For example, they'll classify inexpensive firearms as 'Saturday Night Specials', then ban them.  Then they'll classify certain firearms as 'Assault rifles', and ban them.  Their plan is to continue in this fashion to do an end run around the second amendment.   They did the same thing with free speech, demonizing what they didn't agree with as 'hate speech'.   They're also trying to reinstate the fairness doctrine to stifle free speech.    They try to label abortion as pro choice to make it sound more palatable.|`|m0muVAXfaa	No more than they have a monopoly on ignorance or stupidity.|`|wFmL5tWEaa	No, both the Republican and the Democrats do it equally, that is why I have vowed never to vote either Republican nor Democrat ever again. Our Constitution was written and put into place to guide our government as to how a republic should be run and both the Republicans and the Democrats have both run amuck with violations of our Constitution equally.
n2oEhdZiaa	Was the release you signed so he could find the scores of an ASVAB you took previously?  Usually they stop calling if you are unqualified.  Did you tell him you are waiting for sentencing on robbing a liquor store or something?  If you haven't done anything wrong and either haven't taken the ASVAB or passed it, he may have lost your info (unlikely) or had some kind of personal emergency.  Call.|`|CAdHpqyOaa	Call him back and ask whats going on. In the military we refer to people by rank, but just call him sir.|`|5Md4pLtyaa	Your recruiter is a salesman, he gets caught up with about 2000 other "customers" including you, it is possible all is well and because of this it requires little attention except the occasional follow up.<br>  You should address the recruiter buy sir or Ma'am unless instructed to do differently, chances are sargent, staff sgt or rank is fine to them, they are after all working men and women and earned their rank and deserve to be respected in that manner.<br>  But by all means call them everyday if you want, go hang at the recruiting office if you want, they like that sort of motivation.<br>  Good Luck and God Speed!|`|7qRFw5fjaa	Definitely, call and ask!  It's the best job you will ever have!  Sir is a proper noun in the military, it will due just fine.
GrKiEDb1aa	Let's see...U.S. Military (not necessarily the U.S. Army) gives  you FREE SCHOOLING (paid while going), FREE FOOD, FREE CLOTHING (plus an allowance for upkeep), FREE SHELTER (barracks...2 - 4 guys to a room), FREE MEDICAL/DENTAL, 30 DAYS PAID VACATION EACH YEAR, the CHANCE TO TRAVEL TO DIFFERENT STATES/COUNTRIES and be paid for it.  Hands on training for something, if you pick the right MOS, you can transfer to a well paying civilian job.  Also, you can get money for working on a college degree or training in a trade (plumber, electrician, etc).  <br>  What 'assisted home living' company would do that for you?<br>  I spent 20 years in the U.S .Navy, and each job I had since retiring was because of my Navy experience (longest was 7 years, this one has been going for over 15 years).  I was on 5 ships, stationed in 3 countries, visited over 30 (some more than once), sailed 8 oceans/seas, was on 6 of the 7 continents, got to spend 13 months in Antarctica (at my request...how many people get to do that?), picked up 7 languages enough to eat, shop, not get lost, and carry on a limited conversation.  My retirement more than pays for my mortgage. Because of my military experience I've been working with foreign navies (as a U.S. gov't contractor) for over 15 years.  I've even gotte to do some stateside travel (10 days up to 6 months) and some overseas travel because of this job.  <br>  Joining the military wouldn't be the worst you could do.<br>  (USN, retired 1965 -85)|`|CAdHpqyOaa	please only join the army unless you are passionate about the military.|`|5Md4pLtyaa	Well if you like wiping asses for a living by all means keep getting paid to do that.<br>  If you want to Kick some asses and get paid doing that then by all means the military is waiting.  Plus will the *** wiping pay for college?  give you a sense of family, take you to exotic beaches around the world and let you blow stuff up?<br>  You need to ask yourself this.<br>  Good luck|`|aqeWwA71aa	I bet the Army would open all sorts of doors for you - and maybe they'd send you to school to learn some job.
LcYeN6m5aa	Its not your ASVAB (although 87 is pretty darn good) it's whether you have a kidney problem. <br>  <br>  They are more willing to work with you if you make it in - and are still willing to work with you to help you join (hence the waiver request) - but your ASVAB doesn't have a whole lot to do with it. <br>  <br>  All tech jobs still require physical readiness in the military.|`|5Md4pLtyaa	your asvab score wil do nothing to sway the review board, I am sure stephen hawkins will get a perfect score on the asvab but there is no way they would consider him, but all is not lost!  Protien levels are not all that bad, it just makes the doctors at MEPS (who by the way are there because they could not get a real job) put up a red flag.  If I were you I would get an opionon from your private doctor and find out why your protien levels are so high.  It could be blood, it could be a kidney problem and then it could just be natural for you, heck you could just be a bit dehydrated.  <br>  If you get the opportunity to go again and take a follow up pee test, drink as much filtered water as possible, do not eat anything the night before and make sure you are pissing clear before you go and then drink water up until you go in for the test, they will not stop you from doing this, they know your there for the test and they wil let you camp out next to the scuttlebutt ( you will need to know what that is if you join  the navy).<br>  <br>  Good luck and god speed.
hmsMpECkaa	Yes, he does and he says he is trying to quit inhaling.|`|aqeWwA71aa	Ya - the poor guy - it's quite widely known, but I don't think there's any pictures.

gasquENMaa	This is a variation of the older MMPI test for military top secret clearances that has been updated for Corrections.     You will be given a set of "rules" at the beginning of each test segment. You will then see several different scenarios responding the rules you were given.     You will have multiple choice answers for each scenario. What the test is designed to do is see how you evaluate each circumstance. They are going to give you "reasons" why you might want to vary your response over the "rules".     This is a basic common sense test. Best advice is STICK TO THE RULES. Both for this test and while working on the job. You will hear sob stories and every valid reason under the sun from human predators who are extremely adept at lying through their teeth. "How can I tell the inmate is lying? His lips are moving". A joke, but in many cases, not far from the truth.    The test is graded from 1 to 100, with 100 being perfect. There is no pass/fail on this, but the selection process starts at the top and works down. If your collective score is below an 80, the chances of the positions being filled before the selection reaches you is extremely high.     Stick to the rules, don't be a "nice guy" and you will do great.      Best of luck and I hope this is useful to you  Source(s):  20 years as a Corrections Officer in a max prison|`|RRFbDou9aa	It's logic; don't use any 'knowlege' you get from TV or even from real corrections experience.  They're testing your reasoning skills.
bmCInR5qaa	It's yet another impressive display of unconscious projection from cons.  The governor of the state that has received more federal money than any other ($130 billion for Katrina alone) grandstanding about federal spending.<br>  <br>  Who's #2 you ask?  <br>  <br>  Alaska.<br>  <br>  Isn't it interesting that the people crowing about their state tax rates are the same ones from states who take in substantially more federal money than they send to the federal government?|`|Ko2QX3Cvaa	Jindal is seriously cracking me up with this blatant hypocrisy at ever turn. The stimulus package is a horrible idea and he's totally against taking the money - all but about 2%, that is. He has no qualms about requesting additional funds for LA's levees - everyone else's potential natural disasters (volcanoes) be damned. And of course he's not going to risk his next term by taxing LA's citizens for their levees - he'd rather the rest of us paid for their projects. But federal stimulus is still bad.|`|AA11593971	The question is not the relevance of those projects, it's whether they have any business being in an economic stimulus package... and they don't. The stimulus package is meant for one thing only... to jumpstart the economy. Contrary to popular opinion, money does not come from a bottomless well, so it needs to be put where it can do the greatest good for the purpose it was intended for.<br>  <br>  What don't you get about that concept?|`|dLVoWjwOaa	Bobby Jindal is the worst speaker I've ever heard.

But, the stimulus package Obama wants passed actually gives food stamps and welfare a "blank check".  Nice huh?|`|AA11819105	Im not sure and the gov. wouldn't release the truth anyway.    How ever corporate welfare is much higher then general welfare|`|rUNlmQG5aa	Less than but very close to the interest on the national debt as far as I have been able to determine using some simple math. This interest has doubled during the Bush tenure and is nearly half of all individual income tax this year. No economist but It can't be that far off. Does not include S.S. or medicare, by the way-1.2 trillion a year but technically not "Welfare" as it is drawn from our paychecks. These are cursory figures on my part and may be easily looked up.
dBb3wIFfaa	I used to live in an apartment and I found a gun on the basketball court before. One time there was a gang fight right outside of my room! My friends mom was murdered and my dad's friend was shot to death. When I was 8 I remember my dad getting jumped for about 20 dollars and his cigarettes.     It really has affected me, causing me to be paranoid everywhere I go.|`|zH1sg3Xraa	It is emotionally disturbing. In my city, about a year ago, a deaf young man walked to Dollar Store one Sunday afternoon, and he was beat up and robbed of his hearing aids and about twenty dollars cash in the parking lot in front of Dollar Store. This really emotionally upset me. The poor deaf man, spent a week in a hospital from the trauma. I think that drugs and gangs upset everyone and it is no longer safe to walk anywhere alone.|`|huJ2zJTgaa	OH please, the 'gang' influence promotes hatred, and domination over people. It retards the potential growth of an individual to raise up over the societal situation!    What, are you 'for' gangs? Who hasn't? Indirectly, if I had a child, or a parent, that needed help, health care, a good teacher, a lawyer, even a Police officer... these people might of been from a childhood that involved gangs, and gangs is what either prevented them from fulfilling their dreams, or dictated what there dreams were to begin with? What if instead, this gang member gets the girl member pregnant, and she has this child, it has this type of mentality as it's upbringing... and in some instance, envokes violence to some one else, hurting instead of healing, as a member of society... do you not think you might be affected by this?  You have to know that many things are connected in life, and certainly some social organization, no matter what it's label, will directly effect you in some way or the other, or some one you know, or some one that you are in acquaintance with, directly or in-directly....which still is some type of connection!
u6ALw1gAaa	I've taken my son into work with me but just on days when I was doing reports in the Office.  I would never take him on a call with me.    If her Chief and or supervisor lets her get away with it then it is "okay" but I don't recommend it.  Even mundane calls can get dangerous if the right people are involved.  However, I doubt the ten year old suffered any type of trauma from seeing people in handcuffs or bags of drugs.  She has probably seen worse on the news.|`|5072c885a0d43b66b964ac86a027351faa	Police in the uk are not even aloud to take work experience or cadets with them so taking there kids is a Massive no no!|`|g3CrnbhAaa	I believe it is legal in the USA.

The Girl would not be covered by any insurance like the Police woman would be.  It may be that the Police woman had picked up her daughter after her shift was over and while going Home ,a situation arose that had to be dealt with promptly while back up was on the way. Something like that anyway .... It was a bloody foolish thing to do anyway.|`|BtGy5AFFaa	I wouldn't think it is legal, or ethical!
1d521d1ad2fdf38cda15eff82d979ed9aa	UPDATED: <br>  <br>  (Another answer gave this link: <br>  <a href="http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=32189" rel="nofollow">http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=32189</a> <br>  but that applies only to people born in Portugal who didn't have Portuguese citizenship because their parents were immigrants)<br>  <br>  You definitely need to contact the embassy or consulate to be sure, but it's not likely. Your parent may have been or may be eligible to acquire citizenship by reason of descent. Usually countries don't allow that to be passed on to the next generation; I didn't find anything definitive at Wikipedia about that. Likely since (s)he was not born in Portugal you are not eligible, but as I say check with the consulate to be certain. Have your grandfather's, parents' and your own birth certificates and marriage certificates as applicable.|`|a66nvk0taa	<a href="http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=32189" rel="nofollow">http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=32189</a>|`|qYVyZqq2aa	consult the embassy and an immigration attorney|`|6L9jJnchaa	No, it doesn't work that way.
Tb91H3D9aa	I have been in the Navy for two years and as far as I have seen the Exceptional Family Member Program is command-focused.  Whenever he actually gets to his duty station (NOT necessarily Basic Training or even his A School) there should be a representative for the program available who should do everything in his power to help you (as far as I have seen, he can help a lot).<br>  <br>  On a note about accompanying him in his school: most schools under a certain amount of time will not allow him to be accompanied.  The reason some schools have you wait some time before he can move off the barracks with you is because there is a Phases system that he must adhere to which poses some initial restrictions that will eventually disappear (in this case, that might be the reason you have to wait 9 weeks).  AS SOON as your husband gets there (not after 9 weeks) he should be finding out whether you can in fact accompany him and how to get the process started.  If you can go with him, it should be relatively painless.  I will say this, though: it is hardly worth bothering if his school is going to be a short one.  This is just more of a hassle for yourself and your child, particularly with adapting to a different environment.<br>  <br>  My final advice is this, though it is not the last time you will hear this: make sure his time in the Navy ends up benefitting him, not just him benefitting the Navy.  There are many opportunities in place for servicemembers that he should not pass up, from simple discounts in stores to fully paid education to cost-reduced care for your son.  If he does not plan to make the Navy a career, make sure to at least look at every possibility before his time is up.|`|Vc5Nnxeuaa	Talk to his recruiter. Yell at them if you need to. If they promised him this, make them follow through on it. <br>  I suggest waiting on moving til after he is done with Basic and goes on to A school. Most of the time A school is in another part of the country.
FNMMm7Dnaa	none|`|5Md4pLtyaa	Tell them you lost it.  When you turn it in it is in pieces anyhow, they cannot reuse it.  <br>  My brother drove around for years in my old Jeep that had my NAS New Orleans sticker on it.  <br>  They will not do anything to you.  It could be a bit harder getting a new one sometimes but if you already have one then forget it.|`|GSJ9gqVWaa	Report it now.  The chance of anything going wrong si tiny, but it is a bit worrying that the person can't be found.  Report it, with a  description, the license plate number and a description.<br>  <br>  The repercussions are not that serious.|`|eRmunUJHaa	there shouldnt be one.|`|cbIxKGZVaa	Ya don't worry about it most bases are going away from using 2220's anyways<br>  <br>  It has become almost obsolete with the 100 percent ID check all the time now|`|GrKiEDb1aa	Contact the base pass office and have them delete it from the records.  If you can contact the buyer, do so soonest.  They can't use it to get on base unless they have a proper ID anyway. And if the buyer is military, if something happens with the car and you've already contacted the pass office, it can't come back on you.<br>  If you do get the sticker off, let the pass office know anyway that you no longer have the car.  My office rented a truck (Indian navy paid for it while we were working with them.) I turned the truck in but when I renewed MY base sticker, the pass office still had that truck on my record, 2 years later.  When I told them we no longer had the truck, the clerk deleted it from my record.
OVUkamlpaa	I love the "I can't pay I'm disabled" crap.

What do you think?<br>  <br>  There will be a warrant for your arrest and you will go to jail. Your fines will be even higher. What is it with you people? Do you think they just forget and it goes away?<br>  <br>  Quit breaking the law and pay your fines. Is it really that hard to figure out?|`|nxEoR9CEaa	It has been a year.  I am sure a bench warrant has already been issued for your arrest.  Most police departments have hundreds of warrants to follow up on, but not enough officers to make arrests.  Contact the court, make payment arrangements.  If you do nothing, eventually you will be arrested and go to jail.  If you are arrested on a Friday, you will be in jail till Monday before you have the opportunity to see the judge and bail yourself out. If the fine was part of your probation, the judge can revolk your probation, and a jail sentence imposed.  You should contact a criminal attorney.|`|B4O3f8w6aa	You can be sure a bench warrant is already been placed on you. No notice is given. Should you get stopped, you will go to jail until you see a judge. Your checks will pile up while you are waiting to get out.|`|1Ayb4UK7aa	Your probation can be revoked and you can go to jail.|`|88e756791fb9ff8d6c4b3d2a67a7624faa	The fine is not much, you can pay that even if you are only Social Security Disability - what you need to do is get a loan or save half of each check until you have enough and pay it before you end up in jail. And yes, if a bench warrant is issued you can be arrested on the spot.|`|xd7tSmQeaa	Since you are still on probation you could be arrested for violating it.  This would be for not paying your fine.  You could also be hit with a contempt charge for disobeying the judges order.  <br>  <br>  The rest of your probation could very easily be spent locked up.<br>  <br>  In short, you're screwed.|`|7Z9vHytvaa	you'll go to jail ..|`|RGRNUSGlaa	First of all, court systems suck and they can be extremely strange.<br>  <br>  It's near 100% likely that this will not go away.<br>  You will probably receive the new bench warrant because with most fines there is a time frame they give you to make the payment. Yours perhaps was a year or more (because its a large amount of money I would assume) and this is why you have not received notification of failure to pay.<br>  <br>  My suggestion is to pay this off as soon as possible to avoid being brought back to court. The only thing that will happen is you will get more court fees and possible jail time.
BUI2nlUVaa	Have your doctor fax it to your employer.  They have a right to be informed if you are indeed sick or not.  A doctors note can be required by them.

8hAhmlJjaa	In today's society, drug use by teenagers is the norm.  Therefore, the police expect to have a past history of drug use in an applicants background.  Certain drug use is a no no, and excludes them forever, LSD as mentioned before is one.  How long ago, and how old you were when you did the drugs is important.  If you just quit last week, you will not make it.  If you are 24 years old, and quit when you were 18 years old, you might make it.  There are a lot of variables, but your friend is right in that he needs to quit now, and clean up.  There is a lie detector test where they are not looking for drug usage, but looking to see if you told the truth about your past drug usage.|`|TtI7VtTfaa	No illegal drugs..|`|RRFbDou9aa	Drug use isn't a disqualifier in an of itself, but excessive drug use is.   Some departments exclude officers who have used certain drugs (for example you can't be a police officer in Washington state if you've ever used LSD).  The factors are mainly what you did, how often, and how long ago.    Departments usually verify this with a polygraph or CVSA.

T8nap2Pnaa	Well, check out uscis.gov and take a long look at the information sheet on the I-485 adjustment of status request. since you came in on a visa and are now married to an US citizen, it would be possible for you to adjust status and get a green card without leaving the US, even though you're out of status now. He'd have to file an I-130 immigrant petition, an I-485 and work authorization along with some other forms. and, they should all be filed together. the site has all the downloadable forms and the various fees for them as well. You won't be able to get a work permit by itself though. no one can simply file for a work permit, it has to be based on something that would allow you to work, in this case, your adjustment filing.|`|AA10045620	Yes, you are now illegal.  Go back to your own country and have your husband petition you to come back legally.  Then you would be eligible for a ss number.|`|ggpf6AZuaa	you are illegal if you dont have the proper documentation they can deport you. Do things the proper way|`|cdpBdzZtaa	No you can't obtain work permit ,out of status is same as illegal except you entered legally but failed to maintain legal status,first file papers as soon as possible ,in between if you are caught you can be deported.|`|3BhXf5MYaa	Yes, you are an ILLEGAL ALIEN and subject to deportation.  You also can NOT adjust status while being out of status.  No work permit will be authorized for an out of status alien.    You need to leave the US and have your husband file the paperwork to bring you into the US as a K3 Spouse of a US Citizen.    Working on the F1 is only valid if Optional Practical Training is authorized on the visa and SEVIS I-20AB.    Fed LEO knows the law and works the INA on a daily basis.|`|MeeJWmGtaa	Fed LEO doesn't know what he's talking about.  If you're out of status but ARRIVED in the US via legal means, even an overstayed visa waiver, your husband can petition for you to adjust your status. See the USCIS.gov web site, forms I 485, I 130 etc.  You do NOT need to leave the US, in fact you should not, or you might get barred from re-entry.  File the forms together, 3 months from now you may have your work permit, 6 months from now a conditional green card, 2 years after that, a permanent (10 yrs) green card, 3 years from now, citizenship. If all goes well.  See a immigration lawyer, or ask at familybasedimmigration.com  Hope that helps.|`|d8TGK92jaa	Out of status basically means illegal. I would correct this one ASAP. You don't want the stigma attached to being illegal!|`|ktc9usSqaa	The rule is that you can work for up to one year on a F1 visa after you have graduated from college.    Then the company you are working for or you have to apply for a change in visa status in order to continue to work in this country.    If you are married to a US citizen then he must sponsor you in order for you to stay in this country.    My best suggestion is to consult an immigration attorney in your area to find out what you alien status is.  I do know that once you leave the country you will not be able to return with you current F1 visa.    Good luck

rttm1SLaaa	Doesn't it just make so much sense?  Moreover, Obama's plan is entirely in the budget, and the use of money is entirely spelled out for not only other politicians but also the public at large.  Bush's war in Iraq was entirely off budget (and therefore the amount spent is still uncertain, because it's not in the national debt or the deficit) and the spending locations were mostly kept secret from the public.  Some weren't even told to senators and congressmen.|`|wOc4Dqllaa	It's all about the Republican idea of "patriotism." "Sacrifice for your country! Winning wars is the American Way!

What if instead of appeasing Hitler as liberals love to do, they would have listened to Churchill and had taken him out? Would that expenditure have been worth it? This one probably was worth it too, lucky for us, we don't have to find out, thanks to GWB.    We could have used Iraqi oil to pay back some expenses, but the democrats were so bent on that war being a failure so they could use it for political reasons they screamed bloody murder about a war for oil ... stupid stuff.    It's much different than spending near a trillion on paying off voting groups for getting you elected. Talk about pay to play, what Obama is trying is so much worse than anything Blago ever even thought of doing.|`|noo8vpvzaa	The purpose of our government is to do the things we can't do for ourselves ("can't", not 'WON'T')...Our military protects our country.

What is it? Nearly 35% of the Stimulus package?    Republicans aren't against infrastructure spending. They are against the 65% of the bill that ISN'T infrastructure spending.

If obama wanted to help us out he would give us all a Million dollars each and tell Wall Street to kiss his AZZZ|`|FrfdKKGWaa	Because Obama's stimilus package is not for AMERICA. It is for his LIBERAL AGENDA:    We've looked it over, and even we can't quite believe it. There's $1 billion for Amtrak, the federal railroad that hasn't turned a profit in 40 years; $2 billion for child-care subsidies; $50 million for that great engine of job creation, the National Endowment for the Arts; $400 million for global-warming research and another $2.4 billion for carbon-capture demonstration projects. There's even $650 million on top of the billions already doled out to pay for digital TV conversion coupons.    In selling the plan, President Obama has said this bill will make "dramatic investments to revive our flagging economy." Well, you be the judge.     As for the promise of accountability, some $54 billion will go to federal programs that the Office of Management and Budget or the Government Accountability Office have already criticized as "ineffective" or unable to pass basic financial audits. These include the Economic Development Administration, the Small Business Administration, the 10 federal job training programs, and many more.    Oh, and don't forget education, which would get $66 billion more. That's more than the entire Education Department spent a mere 10 years ago and is on top of the doubling under President Bush. Some $6 billion of this will subsidize university building projects. If you think the intention here is to help kids learn, the House declares on page 257 that "No recipient . . . shall use such funds to provide financial assistance to students to attend private elementary or secondary schools." Horrors: Some money might go to nonunion teachers.    The larger fiscal issue here is whether this spending bonanza will become part of the annual "budget baseline" that Congress uses as the new floor when calculating how much to increase spending the following year, and into the future. Democrats insist that it will not. But it's hard -- no, impossible -- to believe that Congress will cut spending next year on any of these programs from their new, higher levels. The likelihood is that this allegedly emergency spending will become a permanent addition to federal outlays -- increasing pressure for tax increases in the bargain. Any Blue Dog Democrat who votes for this ought to turn in his "deficit hawk" credentials.    This is supposed to be a new era of bipartisanship, but this bill was written based on the wish list of every living -- or dead -- Democratic interest group. As Speaker Nancy Pelosi put it, "We won the election. We wrote the bill." So they did. Republicans should let them take all of the credit.|`|a9fm2ozMaa	Because spending money to defend the country from those that want to kill us and their supporters is a constitutional mandate of the federal gov't, but spending money on much of the pork in the guise of a stimulus bill is not.|`|c2dfad4dc1f663f9f98d8667a84e7f6daa	This is how much we've spent on the war in Iraq.

It is all based on their false ideology.|`|AA11195316	Well, we the people have a new president. Its an exciting time for Americans, whether or not you agree with President Barack Obamas plans. My hope is that our new president will instill some confidence in people, not necessarily set out to fix everybody and everything.     There are some bogus government strategies floating around to stimulate the economy and "save us from ourselves." Just because theyre all everyone talks about doesnt make them true! Here are a few of the big issues:     Tax Breaks  These arent bad, and I would never turn them down. But to think that tax breaks single-handedly stimulate the economy is laughable. Remember last fall? Those stimulus checks didnt fix the problem, so what makes us think its going to fix everything this time? Did you know it was your money to start with? Theyre just giving it back to you and making you feel good about it. If youre looking for $1,000 to change your life this year, you obviously dont have a life to start with!    It may help you today or this month, but $1,000 will do very little for you in the long run. To win with money, you've got to think long term.    Patriotic Duty  The government wants you to spend, spend, spendand many Americans are taking this advice while still in debt! No matter what the talking heads say, it is not your patriotic duty to spend money you dont have. Your duty is to take care of yourself and your household with the money you earn from an honest days work.    If you have your full emergency fund and are in a position to buy something, now is the perfect time! You can get some fabulous deals, but dont let the deals entice you if you havent planned ahead and dont have the cash!    National Deficit  The dog is still chasing its tail.     Debt started the problem, so what is the current plan to fix the problem? More debt!  What really drives the economy? Is it D.C.'s programs or small-business people scattered throughout the country? This down economic time will begin to heal itself. Do we have to go $1 trillion in debt to do that? No way!    The good news is that our future as an economy isnt coming out of Washington. Our future prosperity is coming out of the hopes, dreams and individual freedoms of the American people. When left alone, we have a tendency to prosper.     The healing of the economy will begin and end with you. Yes, you, the person you see in the mirror! You have to make your decision as to whether or not youre going to take part in the recession.    As for our new president, if youre not a fan, pray for him. Hes your president. If you are a fan, pray for him. Hes your president, not your savior. Your hope will be crushed if you wait for him and his administrationor anyone elseto fix your life and give you money.      good luck|`|AA10206116	This spending you are talking about is supposed to stimulate economy and create jobs, which it does not.

Democrats especially. Part of their early training  How to Lie with a Straight Face  Step1: Make up the lie. Before you can lie with a straight face, you must first have something to lie about that negates turning from the truth.   Step2: Go over the details to assure accuracy. Once you have thought up just what it is you are going to lie about, run through the details over and over to assure that your lie sounds solid and genuine.   Step3: Never confess to the truth, lie some more. A true liar will never confess that they lied. You must in turn  have others follow suit. Lies beget lies and so should you if somebody calls you on what you have told him  Step4: Make it sound like  you are doing it is for their own good not yours. Your just being a good person  Step5: Try to discourage people from finding out the real truth. Keep them busy if possible. Flatter them  Step6 Do it all will a trust me smile and an educated attitude    Remember, to truly lie like a pro dem, you must firmly make believe in the lie that you are telling as if it were the truth and keep a straight face at all times.

It is not the workers who want the current system, it is the companies.    The reason why companies like the current system is easy to figure out.  With card-check, there is not a "campaign period" prior to the decision to certify.  Instead, it is a gradual process of secretly obtaining the votes from the workers.

That can only be done by duly appointed elections officials.  Registration forms from all sources are collected and handed over to elections officials, and all fraudulent ones are weeded out.  Trust me, no one named "Mickey Mouse" showed up at a poll to vote.    The fact that you don't seem to know that, and the further fact that you have confused the Fairness Doctrine--which applied to broadcast media--with voter registration, indicate to me that you either lack an understanding of these issues and/or are simply regurgitating what you've heard on the right-wing noise machine.  Please do more research.
jRtQTN24aa	It's actually the Censorship Doctrine. certain members of Congress, like Pelosi and Reid , think that they should decide what "we the people" should be able to listen to. This is text book socialist tactics.  Silence the opposition. Notice the cendoc only applies to conservative talk radio. It leaves ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, MS-NBC , the MoveOn dot  Morons and papers such as the Associated Press (a monopoly) out  of the equation.   Amendment I , of the Constitution of the United States  Congress shall make no laws ........or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press......    In the opinion of myself, and many I know, anyone in Congress that would try and push this censorship on anyone in the U.S.,or support such legislation, should be removed  from office, They took an oath to " protect and defend the Constitution". To support this censorship, it is obvious that they lied.  There was a time, not that long back there was a saying here that, " I may not agree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it."  Now, we are cursed with a breed of politicians that believe, "I only support that with which I agree."    Those are the ones that are walkin on the fightin side of me.    Added : Romare, you need to check your facts first. It was reported today on CBS radio that, in fact, a couple of Libtard  Democrooks, in congress, publicly stated they want the CenDoc. back. I let you guess which two.   Added II : Tmess2  Wrong. Radio stations are a for profit business. The truth of the matter is that consirvative talk radio has 1: listeners and 2: turn a profit.   Lib talk radio, such as Air America, had minimual listeners, and worked at a loss. Ergo they went defunct. Not that many people wanted to hear their lib BS.  Libs want "fairness"?  Get out and start your own radio shows. If it can turn a profit, more power to them. But I prefer not to have what I'm listening to enterupted by some moron spouting BS  I have  NO interest in listening to.|`|Ca8i226Xaa	The UnFairness Doctrine is the only way that liberals can ensure that liberal talk radio can survive. It is a way of silencing conservative voices. Let's face it, aside from Fox News and a few token conservatives on the other TV news networks, the MSM is dominated by liberals, many of whom no longer feel the need to pretend to be unbiased. Obama has set free the liberal MSM's obligation to appear unbiased.    You are not paranoid to be afraid of the libs bringing back the fairness doctrine. Pelosi and other Dem Congress Critters have talked about the need to silence "hate" speech from the right. Keep up the fight!|`|2iFFdxQAaa	The Fairness Doctrine is a diabolically evil plan to prevent rich dudes like Murdock from buying up all the people's radio and television frequencies to then hire retarded shills like Hannity, O'Reilly and Limbaugh to mouth his Reactionary Right Wing horse crap 24/7 with no time left for dissenting opinions to compete.      The only garbage is your fake avatar.  You're obviously a white middle aged racist who was too dumb and too mean to ever graduate from a university.|`|e6V3xf8zaa	Actually, the Supreme Court did not abolish the fairness doctrine.  In the only case on it, Red Lion v. FCC, they approved it.    It was the FCC under Reagan that abolished the fairness doctrine.     Not that anyone is trying to resurrect it (because with satelite radio and cable tv, it no longer matters), but the purpose behind it made sense.  In the U.S., the government owns the radio/tv frequencies.  They license it to private broadcasters.  When there was very little available frequency, to assure that everyone had an opportunity to be heard on the public airways, they required broadcasters to make equal time avalable to both sides.    The fairness doctrine died when cable came on the scene.  Because cable does not use the public airways, it was exempt from the FCC.  That means that if the fairness doctrine was reinstated, it would not apply to either Faux News or MSNBC.  Nor would it apply to Sirius or other pay radio services.   So even if the fairness doctrine was reinstated, the ditto heads could still get Limbaugh on their radio undiluted by an alternative point of view, they just would be the ones paying for it instead of tax payers subsidizing Mr. Limbaugh.  (And yes taxpayers do subsidize broadcast TV and radio, a fair auction of the licenses would bring a lot more revenue than the current scheme.)|`|xJmDP5NGaa	Actually the way the bill is worded it only effects the Conservative shows....so it is NOT fair and should not be doctrine....but libs only believe in free speech when they or someone they agree with is speaking...in their opinions all others should be shouted down or silenced......DemocRAT Hypocritical "Tolerance" at their finest|`|3yXhtBSxaa	The fairness doctrine is not fair in any way, shape, or form.

Only the Flying Monkey Right Wing Loons talk about it.|`|joh3VNcZaa	They don't want both sides of an issue.  They want to silence talk radio since it doesn't spew the liberal agenda.      You notice the Fairness Doctrine never mentions CNN or MSNBC?|`|089e8d35b7463b74daf5b60e025ccdc5aa	No one on the left wants the fairness doctrine; this is just a fear tactic being put out there by the right (if you think I'm wrong, remember where you heard about this).    So not to worry.    On another note, I'm pretty sure that the 70 million Americans who voted for Obama, and the 70% of Americans who now approve of him even if they didn't vote for him, are not so stupid that "tingling legs" made the difference.  Remember that Ronald Reagan said that if you purport to love your country, you must love your countrymen as well.  In your case, that seems to mean the Obama voters.|`|fbe600962a1348933b552a6e772b27b2aa	There is nothing FAIR about that Fairness Doctrine.

Then there are people like Dennis Miller and Michael Medved who are class acts and very respectful to the liberals who call their show.

And regular citizens are hurting bad!|`|AA10818613	Oh please, this is such a non-issue it's laughable.  Democrats believe that rich people should have their taxes raised.  You can't have it both ways when you fallaciously describe which one Democrats believe.  You can't say that Democrats want higher taxes for the rich and complain about it and then turn around and say that they believe taxes are only to be paid by the 'little people.'  Which one is it?  BTW,  very few Democrats in office are what you call upper class elite rich like you see with McCain.|`|t3QAaSN9aa	It's the Republicans who believe that taxes are only to be paid by the little people.  The Republicans have tried everything they could think of to lower taxes for the wealthy including cutting income tax rates, eliminating estate taxes, eliminating capital gains taxes, etc. They have of course not been successful in all of their efforts. If it were up to Republicans only the middle class people who work would pay income taxes.     The two that you mentioned are among many Americans who have made errors concerning taxes.  Their tax problems are not concerning issues that are ordinarily encountered by most people or even ordinarily encountered by many people in the upper income brackets.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	so that people like you will get so confused those mean & nasty grown ups are trying to screw up your mind. Don't worry they are going to mess up your thinking if you pay attention to what they do.|`|pnpkJKvpaa	You have no idea what "rich" is.    And they pay a very low % of taxes:    "The top 400 paid just more than $18 billion in federal income taxes in 2006, or an average of $45 million, on a record $105 billion in total income  the lowest effective tax rate in the 15 years since the agency began releasing such data."    ------------------------------    A Rich Income in 06 Was $263 Million [each!!!]    By LYNNLEY BROWNING  The income of the 400 wealthiest Americans swelled in 2006, soaring nearly 23 percent from the previous year, to an average of $263 million, according to data released Thursday by the Internal Revenue Service. Since 1996, this group has nearly doubled its share of all income earned in the United States.    The top 400 paid just more than $18 billion in federal income taxes in 2006, or an average of $45 million, on a record $105 billion in total income  the lowest effective tax rate in the 15 years since the agency began releasing such data.    That compares with nearly $1 trillion paid by all other individual taxpayers in 2006.    The gains for the richest took place amid a booming economy, in which hedge funds and private equity firms blossomed and the subprime lending machine went into high gear.    The rising wealth of the nations richest taxpayers will most likely intensify debate among tax and policy analysts about the equitability of the tax code, which analysts say favors the ultrawealthy.    Tax cuts enacted by the Bush administration that benefit the wealthy are set to expire by 2011.    Until recently, we had a financial system that rewarded investors, and we have a tax system that does as well, said Robert S. McIntyre, the director of Citizens for Tax Justice.    Now wealthy people, he said, pay income tax rates well below those of working-class citizens because of a myriad of tax breaks. A lower capital gains tax, now at 15 percent, down from 28 percent in 1997, benefits investors with big portfolios.    The average adjusted gross income in 2006 of more than $263 million for the top 400 taxpayers compared with an average of $214 million in 2005. It was three and a half times what they earned in 1996, which was $74 million.    And their average tax rate continued to a 15-year low of 17 percent.    But their contribution to federal coffers rose slightly, to nearly 1.8 percent of total contributions by all individual taxpayers. About 130 million taxpayers file returns each year.    The growth in income came primarily from dividends and interest income, not rising salaries and wages. Capital gains income jumped to 63 percent of the adjusted gross income of the richest 400, up from 58 percent in the previous year.    As a percentage of their income, salaries and wages fell to 7.4 percent of their total income, down from more than 12.5 percent just two years earlier. But taxable interest as a percentage of their income rose to nearly 7.8 percent, the highest level since the dot-com boom era of 1995.    The higher income also came from a sharp rise in claims for foreign tax credits, typically through privately owned entities. Such claims rose in 2006 to an average $2.5 million from $1.7 million the year earlier, and quadruple the level in 1996.    More than half, or nearly 54 percent, of all the itemized deductions taken by the wealthiest were related to their charitable contributions, a figure roughly unchanged since 1996.    And while the top 400 wealthiest earned more deductions from their charitable contributions, such gifts still account for just 5.19 percent of all itemized charitable contributions by all taxpayers.|`|lvBUl3Zdaa	That's what the Republicans believe.

rttm1SLaaa	This is a somewhat interesting question because we did receive a subpoena recently.  The issue here is that he's trying to utilize executive privilege to get out of having to testify, since he was given a note by the ex-president saying he doesn't have to.  Will he go to jail?  Most likely not.  This will probably go to the supreme court very quickly, where people will argue whether or not executive privilege can extend to a person in the White House beyond the President, and if so, whether that privilege exists after they've left.  The fact is there's no reason to assume any such thing.  Executive privilege was created specifically for the President and only a portion of that privilege exists after they're out of office.  That's the long answer.  The short one is: if the USSC agrees with what is actually stated on executive privilege, he'll go to prison for not testifying, though it may take a while to force him.    I just finished reading through the answers you've gotten, and the ones that state that this is Obama being oppressive apparently don't understand the legal system.  First off, Obama is not the one who is trying to get Rove to testify, he has nothing to do with this.  Second, I don't care if Rove is guilty of nothing, ignoring a subpoena is punishable under the law.  This is not a partisan attack guys.  If he has nothing to prosecute on him, he can go to court, speak the truth, and come out of it looking cleaner.  The goal of this is to investigate possibly unlawful activities perpetrated by other members of the administration.|`|QskM0Mfsaa	THAT ARROGANT Bastard thinks he is above the law..  he will crack like an egg if he gets caught in something then its off to prison for bush and cheney|`|pnpkJKvpaa	Either one is fine with me.|`|VS0PuI5paa	For what, being a Republican?  Sorry, the Soviet Union is dead.|`|oVmGcRVtaa	I expect more stonewalling|`|odBWpML6aa	That's not an either/or question.      Some context (NYT, yesterday 30 Jan 2009)    "House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers Jr. issued a new subpoena to Karl Rove, seeking his testimony on the firings of the U.S. attorneys and other alleged politicizations of the Justice Department during the Bush Administration. Rove had sloughed off an earlier subpoena from Conyers, issued last May, citing absolute immunity"    I'd hope the answer to whether he testifies Monday is NO.    I'd also hope that the answer about his going to jail is also NO.    But I fear that Obama's channeling of both Hitler and Stalin as to style of tyranny means many o' many will end up heading to the camps.    Who is next?    Of course if the sane among us start standing their ground and opposing this new set of petty tyrants raised by a mind-numbed mob into the highest office, perhaps we can slow them down (or G-d willing, stop them and toss them out of office) enough that they never quite reach the energy level of Hitler and Stalin, but dang it, we are too close already.    Stand tall, and have courage, sane ones!    * * *     To a later respondent:  Obama, in the role of his party's leader, could stop this circus in two phone calls.  Just as Hitler and Stalin came into power supported by an energetic cohort of like-minded individuals, so to has Obama, Rex Mundi, achieved his usurper's crown.

Steve Beshear deployed every last one of his Army National Guardsmen on Saturday, with his state still reeling after a deadly ice storm encrusted it this week."    "The addition of 3,000 soldiers and airmen makes 4,600 Guardsmen pressed into service. It's the largest call-up in Kentucky history, which Beshear called an appropriate response to a storm that cut power to more than 600,000 people, the state's largest outage on record."

FEMA's never responded to them before unless it was a major disaster.  Should they start now and waste your tax dollars?

Kill the program and fund something cheaper that will replace the aging equipment we have and relevant to today's battlefield. Demand that it gets fielded within five years or less.

Every time you post on here it's about something you surmise, is the fault of the republicans.    My findings are that Jimmie Carter was the first to start offering housing to those who couldn't ante up.  Clinton took it over the top and included Freddie and Fannie to the degree they were involved.  Two previous chairmen of the Federal Reserve were fully aware of what was going on, yet said nothing,      At least three Republican presidents served while this was going on.  They did little to enhance it and nothing to stop it.  Chris Dodd and Barney Franks were the last to dirty their hands over this program.    So, as you can see, there's enough blame to go around.  The democrats for planning and executing this mess, and the republicans for ignoring it.    I didn't realize you were so influential in government.  Can you fix a few parking tickets ?
AA11195316	Well, we the people have a new president. Its an exciting time for Americans, whether or not you agree with President Barack Obamas plans. My hope is that our new president will instill some confidence in people, not necessarily set out to fix everybody and everything.     There are some bogus government strategies floating around to stimulate the economy and "save us from ourselves." Just because theyre all everyone talks about doesnt make them true! Here are a few of the big issues:     Tax Breaks  These arent bad, and I would never turn them down. But to think that tax breaks single-handedly stimulate the economy is laughable. Remember last fall? Those stimulus checks didnt fix the problem, so what makes us think its going to fix everything this time? Did you know it was your money to start with? Theyre just giving it back to you and making you feel good about it. If youre looking for $1,000 to change your life this year, you obviously dont have a life to start with!    It may help you today or this month, but $1,000 will do very little for you in the long run. To win with money, you've got to think long term.    Patriotic Duty  The government wants you to spend, spend, spendand many Americans are taking this advice while still in debt! No matter what the talking heads say, it is not your patriotic duty to spend money you dont have. Your duty is to take care of yourself and your household with the money you earn from an honest days work.    If you have your full emergency fund and are in a position to buy something, now is the perfect time! You can get some fabulous deals, but dont let the deals entice you if you havent planned ahead and dont have the cash!    National Deficit  The dog is still chasing its tail.     Debt started the problem, so what is the current plan to fix the problem? More debt!  What really drives the economy? Is it D.C.'s programs or small-business people scattered throughout the country? This down economic time will begin to heal itself. Do we have to go $1 trillion in debt to do that? No way!    The good news is that our future as an economy isnt coming out of Washington. Our future prosperity is coming out of the hopes, dreams and individual freedoms of the American people. When left alone, we have a tendency to prosper.     The healing of the economy will begin and end with you. Yes, you, the person you see in the mirror! You have to make your decision as to whether or not youre going to take part in the recession.    As for our new president, if youre not a fan, pray for him. Hes your president. If you are a fan, pray for him. Hes your president, not your savior. Your hope will be crushed if you wait for him and his administrationor anyone elseto fix your life and give you money.      good luck|`|it2UVkF4aa	We aren't.

I think it will last several years until any relief can be felt from this.

wVik8Fo7aa	Evidently not.  From some of the Y/A questions, some don't understand that the impeachment process occurs in strictly a political arena, and a governmental official is either convicted via this venue and ousted from office or is found innocent of the impeachment charges and retains his position.  A criminal trial may follow which is the legal method to determine guilt or innocence in a court setting.|`|jsS03HSNaa	Actually, I knew that.  I am sixteen and was explaining how Andrew Johnson was impeached but not convicted, and my mom had no clue what I was talking about.  She thought impeachment did mean one got thrown out of office.

If he commits an act that is unconstitutional, the Senate votes on whether his acts were unconstitutional. I believe there has to be a 2/3 majority vote like every other voting ways in order for him to be removed from office.     Tidbit: the only presidents who underwent the impeachment trial were Clinton, and Nixon. Clinton was rendered as doing nothing unconstituional, and Nixon resigned before the impeachment trial, citing he didn't want any events that could split the countries opinions.|`|VTvtKWDCaa	Thanks for letting me know.  I was just sitting here thinking about the impeachment process.      Yeah...that's good.|`|4ErIxkhyaa	I was a bit surprised with the Illinois method But I don't live there    On the Federal level Impeachment is closer to a Grand Jury or an arraignment  If Impeached then you go before the Senate.
oTqZm4NFaa	I find it hilarious the president of the United States is 'fighting' with a radio host. How embarrassing. Obama needs to focus on his 'change' and leave these guys to their free speech.

And his "followers" with their "cult" like behavior makes excuses for every screw up he makes.|`|uije8eDraa	I have never heard Obama mention Limbaugh or Hannity; much less attack them. Where and when did this happen? What is your source?|`|yGXKYptjaa	NOt that I know of, but this has been going on for a while with the "freedom" deal Pelosy wanted.  It is one of the most insane things i have ever heard and would start a riot.  You have to admit that being from a one parent family and shipped around to other relatives he may feel bad about what they say, then again you have to give him credit as it is harder than saying present.    Psychologically, it tells me he realizes he is battling very successful people who didn't go to Harvard or even get out of college and people like that are what made America great as they forged our country (patriotic music plying in the background as I type).      I see your point though, it is sorta nutty that he would go after them and start a rufus over this, but it does lend credibility.  I asked a question a while back "What will Hannity and Rush do if Obama is elected?"  most answered by saying have a field day.

lvBUl3Zdaa	Because when you cut taxes to the wealthy, instead of creating new businesses and jobs, they look for risky high yield investments, which are more likely to turn out to be a scam or fail. )|`|fDuCamMraa	Actually they don't. The bubble and it's "POP" is the result of liberals not being able to keep their hands in their own pockets.    Barney Frank and Cris Dodd were the cause of the latest disaster. It had nothing to do with tax cuts. The Great Depression was deeper and longer because obama's hero FDR had the faulty idea he could "spend his way out of it", just like obama. The Savings & Loan problem was also from politicians interfering with the normal ebb and flow. Tax cuts had nothing to do with that either.    May I suggest you take some courses in basic economics or perhaps you could try to read and understand Tomas Sowell's new book "Applied Economics: Thinking beyond state one" But be forewarned, it's a little deep for a liberal.|`|AA11195316	Well, we the people have a new president. Its an exciting time for Americans, whether or not you agree with President Barack Obamas plans. My hope is that our new president will instill some confidence in people, not necessarily set out to fix everybody and everything.     There are some bogus government strategies floating around to stimulate the economy and "save us from ourselves." Just because theyre all everyone talks about doesnt make them true! Here are a few of the big issues:     Tax Breaks  These arent bad, and I would never turn them down. But to think that tax breaks single-handedly stimulate the economy is laughable. Remember last fall? Those stimulus checks didnt fix the problem, so what makes us think its going to fix everything this time? Did you know it was your money to start with? Theyre just giving it back to you and making you feel good about it. If youre looking for $1,000 to change your life this year, you obviously dont have a life to start with!    It may help you today or this month, but $1,000 will do very little for you in the long run. To win with money, you've got to think long term.    Patriotic Duty  The government wants you to spend, spend, spendand many Americans are taking this advice while still in debt! No matter what the talking heads say, it is not your patriotic duty to spend money you dont have. Your duty is to take care of yourself and your household with the money you earn from an honest days work.    If you have your full emergency fund and are in a position to buy something, now is the perfect time! You can get some fabulous deals, but dont let the deals entice you if you havent planned ahead and dont have the cash!    National Deficit  The dog is still chasing its tail.     Debt started the problem, so what is the current plan to fix the problem? More debt!  What really drives the economy? Is it D.C.'s programs or small-business people scattered throughout the country? This down economic time will begin to heal itself. Do we have to go $1 trillion in debt to do that? No way!    The good news is that our future as an economy isnt coming out of Washington. Our future prosperity is coming out of the hopes, dreams and individual freedoms of the American people. When left alone, we have a tendency to prosper.     The healing of the economy will begin and end with you. Yes, you, the person you see in the mirror! You have to make your decision as to whether or not youre going to take part in the recession.    As for our new president, if youre not a fan, pray for him. Hes your president. If you are a fan, pray for him. Hes your president, not your savior. Your hope will be crushed if you wait for him and his administrationor anyone elseto fix your life and give you money.      good luck|`|yozsPWPZaa	yep,gov. interference.all your facts are wrong,try again...|`|58607c6ba5c8f548e69203c94d723527aa	Tax rates do not create bubbles. Interest rates do. The rates are set by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve creates bubbles.|`|56db1a8e5fe3dfc4d4fbbbff987d0191aa	More government programs that failed.  Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac.  Government programs always fail.  That is why nobody wants this stimulus package approved.  Too much government and programs that fail.  The democrats are the ones generally behind these types of programs.  They love to expand government.  And what we need is less government.  Tax cuts do not cause bubbles that burst.  Credit programs do though.  The one that burst while Bush was in office sent our economy into a tailspin.  But, it started over 30 years ago, while the democrats were in.  Go figure!|`|8OaAmwq8aa	The blame for Capitalism's crashes rests on the shoulders of the owning class.  You see, having more than enough money and wealth, is, well, never good enough.  Being content with having millions or billions of dollars is not what satisfies the Capitalist.  Capital, to the Capitalist, has only one purpose, that is, to make more capital.  And when more capital is made, there is only one mindset that keeps the Capitalist content.  And that is, to add the newly acquired capital to the total and to repeat the process over and over again.  It is this addiction to the process that leads to the inevitable crash.  The owning class, the uber-Capitalists, seldom experience the consequences of Capitalism's bust.  The worker and his or her family does.    So then how healthy can Capitalism's manic-depressive, boom-bust, cycles be?  They are not the least bit healthy to the masses of working people.  Just compare the "suffering" of CEOs who come crawling to Congress for bailouts for their companies with the suffering of families whose bread-winners have lost their jobs and their homes.  It is a travesty that CEOs go to the U.S. Congress to demand multi-billion dollar bailouts, corporate welfare FROM the taxpayers and then to restructure their corporations by laying off workers who not only created the surplus value that paid their salaries, but also paid taxes that funded the bailouts.  If this is not akin to someone raped saying, "thank you", to the rapist, then I don't know what is.      Consider this.  The top 5 percent of U.S. household income grew from 16.6 percent of all income in 1973 to a whopping 21.2 percent, eleven years later in 1994.  The top 20 percent had their incomes go from 43.6 percent of all income to 49.1 percent.  All of this was taking place at the same time that the poorest 20 percent had their incomes fall 2.7 percent.    The inequality between the haves and the have-nots continues to skyrocket.  The disparity takes place at a faster pace in the boom times than in the bust times.  But in the bust times, the bottom only falls out for the working class.  "In 1970, for example, the average for all CEO pay was about 30 times that of an average worker's; this multiple has increased steadily to about 100 times today." (Wealth disparity. The Coming Political Storm. Robert Folsom, April 2008). And just who is at the bottom of the income pile?  Well, it's the workers, those that do all the work that make everything possible that everyone uses, needs and enjoys.

We lost Vietnam, we're not in sight of winning Iraq, and I agree those wer emistakes.  We haven't lost the Afghanistan war, but it certainly has looked like we were giving up.

Three consecutive Republicans  Harding, Coolidge, Hoover    ""One of the main initiatives of both the Harding and Coolidge administrations was the rolling back of income taxes on the wealthy which had been raised during World War I. It was believed that a heavy tax burden on the rich would slow the economy, and actually reduce tax revenues. This tax cut was achieved under President Calvin Coolidge's administration. Furthermore, Coolidge consistently blocked any attempts at government intrusion into private business. Harding and Coolidge's managerial approach sustained economic growth throughout most of the decade, however, the overconfidence of these years contributed to the speculative bubble that sparked the stock market crash and the Great Depression.[4][5] The government's role as an arbiter rather than an active entity continued under President Herbert Hoover""    __  There were more taxes then.|`|58607c6ba5c8f548e69203c94d723527aa	No. It was not.

"They really hit the ground running," said Steve Beshear, interviewed by CNN. "They're working very hard to get all the equipment and supplies here that we need."      Crews have been working to restore power and water service to hundreds of thousands of people. Beshear said that while he realizes "nothing moves fast enough," he said the federal assistance "has been a great help to us so far."    Beshear, a Democrat, explained that when the first wave of bad weather came through on Tuesday and Wednesday morning, officials realized that they needed additional help.    "I called the White House directly at that time. I had my other folks talking to FEMA, but I went straight to the top because we needed fast help," he said.    He said he spoke to the director of intergovernment relations and said she walked Kentucky's paperwork through. He said President Obama called him and told him he was announcing an emergency declaration for the state.    "I can't tell you how appreciative we were," the governor said. "He not only expressed his concern, but he obviously had the Kentuckians in his thoughts and prayers, and he communicated that to us."  -----------------    He released federal aid. What should he do, put on a hard hat?    Seriously, what should he do that he isn't already doing?    Didn't think so.    -----    Support the stimulus package -- it includes money to upgrade the electrical grid.|`|TFdKrkP2aa	He hasn't failed anyone.
AA11195316	Well, we the people have a new president. Its an exciting time for Americans, whether or not you agree with President Barack Obamas plans. My hope is that our new president will instill some confidence in people, not necessarily set out to fix everybody and everything.     There are some bogus government strategies floating around to stimulate the economy and "save us from ourselves." Just because theyre all everyone talks about doesnt make them true! Here are a few of the big issues:     Tax Breaks  These arent bad, and I would never turn them down. But to think that tax breaks single-handedly stimulate the economy is laughable. Remember last fall? Those stimulus checks didnt fix the problem, so what makes us think its going to fix everything this time? Did you know it was your money to start with? Theyre just giving it back to you and making you feel good about it. If youre looking for $1,000 to change your life this year, you obviously dont have a life to start with!    It may help you today or this month, but $1,000 will do very little for you in the long run. To win with money, you've got to think long term.    Patriotic Duty  The government wants you to spend, spend, spendand many Americans are taking this advice while still in debt! No matter what the talking heads say, it is not your patriotic duty to spend money you dont have. Your duty is to take care of yourself and your household with the money you earn from an honest days work.    If you have your full emergency fund and are in a position to buy something, now is the perfect time! You can get some fabulous deals, but dont let the deals entice you if you havent planned ahead and dont have the cash!    National Deficit  The dog is still chasing its tail.     Debt started the problem, so what is the current plan to fix the problem? More debt!  What really drives the economy? Is it D.C.'s programs or small-business people scattered throughout the country? This down economic time will begin to heal itself. Do we have to go $1 trillion in debt to do that? No way!    The good news is that our future as an economy isnt coming out of Washington. Our future prosperity is coming out of the hopes, dreams and individual freedoms of the American people. When left alone, we have a tendency to prosper.     The healing of the economy will begin and end with you. Yes, you, the person you see in the mirror! You have to make your decision as to whether or not youre going to take part in the recession.    As for our new president, if youre not a fan, pray for him. Hes your president. If you are a fan, pray for him. Hes your president, not your savior. Your hope will be crushed if you wait for him and his administrationor anyone elseto fix your life and give you money.      good luck|`|DBIKou8faa	It's not all going to that but actually I do want some more research and prevention....it's nasty stuff.    Edit:  Just to clarify, the bird flu is carried by birds but passed on to humans....and it kills us!!!|`|t3QAaSN9aa	Where are you getting these figures?|`|lRmhwiYpaa	This is for the*birds* and I don't mean that in a good way~    a lot of pork was added to this stimulus bill that will not create jobs or  stimulate the economy~this is throwing money at programs that were left behind but now are being tacked on this stimulus bill  ~Despicable|`|TFdKrkP2aa	How about a source other than your delusional mind.|`|rttm1SLaaa	...You're misrepresenting that total.  870 million is being spent on health care, but most of it isn't aimed towards bird flu.  If you want to prove that it is, you should provide a link stating as much.  This is actually general funding on medical research from what I saw, and though bird flu is included (and does have the potential to become a pandemic if we're not careful, despite your claims, since WWI saw a global pandemic of Influenza very similar to this one).  You say people like me should be pissed off.  I'm certainly annoyed, mainly that I have to respond to so many questions like these that misrepresent where the money's going.|`|Hcg2juS7aa	It just gets worse the more we know about it.  How can anyone support this?|`|SI8NXzNSaa	The best way to disguise Bio-war research, is to claim that it's being used to combat a disease. In the 70's, after Bio-war research was outlawed by treaty, the research was disguised under the flag of viral cancer research, where the researchers did more to create new forms of virus's than anything else.|`|J6OIYcIiaa	Before modern medicane, there was a global pandemic about once every 20-40 years.  Now with modern medicane, its been over 60.  It really is only a  matter of time before a successful virus will come along and start wiping us out until scientists can develop a cure, which could take years.  The bird flu could easily mutate to be easily transmitted between humans.  That 1 billion dollars will be going to preventing the deaths of countless people.    And im sure not all of it is going to the bird flu.|`|FfPUhCuiaa	Where in the world they come up with studying bird flu helps the economy is beyone me!!  It's called a STIMULAS package people!!  I can't believe even the Democrats would go for half the stuff in his "so called" stimulas package!|`|qhdhva5Daa	What material did you read?  I hope you don't think it went to the department of wildlife to save birds.  But then you ARE a republican, so who knows .........|`|VkDtqFWcaa	I DON'T KISS DOGGIES EITHER!!    As I said before, dun expect much from his speech because when one's on the presidential job, all behaves the same except Ronald Reagan. haha cos he did not use doggies for an advisement on national crysis.    Especially when one is incapable to resolve a big crysis, one would use another scenario to divert your attention from economic to other easy handle situation matters. haha....    I copy well from my own Singapore Government's doing.|`|8276fe09a930406f0fa15c60ea31aea8aa	Dumb liberal is an oxymoron kiddo.  You don't kiss chickens but you eat them.  And, if you think the good ol' flu we normally get is bad (which, it can kill if not treated properly), just wait until you get a case of the bird flu.  Finally, only a small portion of that money is going to scientific research, I believe around 20 billion is what's proposed.
B07sKfdvaa	Absolutely...they should also be investigated for conspiracy to socialize the US and usurp the Constitution...And Barney Frank for playing "Just the Tip" with interns|`|AA10206116	Dodd also got a sweet loan on his house while serving on the committee. They should be investigated, but it's not going to happen under democrat rule.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	you must not watch CNN or you would have seen that there are also republicans involved. I have not listened because I am not interested in this with all the things that are so important to me but I have heard Frank explain. I have seen so many bs stories from republicans that now can easily be explained as bs just by going to snopes.com, that I don't even bother to listen. So do some research for once to know what the real story is & not what Rush or Hannity tell you.....if coruption took place than absolutely they should all be investigated & that does include Bush & Cheney & the whole gain that made trillions of dollars in surplus disappear & than added trillion on to our dept. Where did it all go? You don't care about that though do you?|`|Hxttt7G0aa	lol, it wouldn't be much of an investigation. There are enough facts right out in the open that make Blago look like a saint compared to those scum bags. Throw in Waters and Reid also, as well as many more, all democrats. Obama should be on that list as well. He got more money from those evil scum bags than any other while he was in Washington.    The CEOs of Fannie Mae (Reins) and Freddy Mac (forget his name) perpetrated a crime more than 1000 times the volume of Enron, and infinitely more damaging, and it was just as purposeful. Those guys having not even been named in an investigation after what they did to the world economy so they could get their $90,000,000 bonuses for fraudulently representing those bad mortgage based securities as government backed is one of the greatest crimes in history, if not the worst. Compared to them Madeoff's crimes are minuscule.    The democrats being so stinking corrupt and owning the news media there is little chance there will ever be justice for this. Bill Clinton did so much that was public knowledge that should have landed him in jail it's not funny, but he had the press and no one could touch him. I guess Bush could have, but he just wanted to get along with everyone and not tear the country apart. I think he screwed up in spades in trying to get along with these guys. He allowed organized crime in Washington to go unchecked.    Republicans police their own, and no way would any republican get away with any of this crap no matter what they controlled.     Democrats have become a fascist movement and they will police nothing their people do unless they piss off powerful democrats like Blago did when he stopped tax increases. Screwed with the medical lobbies profits by getting drugs from Canada and so those politicians they give to, and the big one, he messed with the bank of America ... and the day after is when they took him in and started all of that to get him out.|`|qhdhva5Daa	Can you say Nixon?|`|5ZfcMc34aa	You say "save Bush for another day"...we all know that Bush is a criminal.

Dodd still can't find his mortgage papers...|`|ovSkTNCoaa	Most definitely. Dodd is calling for CEO's to give back bonuses, is he going to give back the money from the sweet mortgage deal he got?|`|FIXKYCIGaa	Should they be investigated based on a right wing talking point?  No.|`|AU70o6wTaa	should they YES. but by whom?|`|4eLzY2hfaa	frank and dodd are thieves.  fuel prices and the fannie may, freddy mac ignited the fire that brought this recession to light, that was an unintentional revelation on both of their parts.  dodd received special treatment from countrywide via his connection their ceo, dodd denies it, but there is evidence he knew from the get go he was on toni's (mazillo's) sic. list.  if you were on the list you received preferential ttreatment period!  frank was, and amazingly still is chairman of the house banking committee.  he was in charge of doling out money to lending institutions that lent money to people for homes they either couldn't, or wouldn't repay.  all this time frank was lauding the good standing of fannie and freddy, he knew this could come down and didn't act.  the banks many under duress from frank and ACORN lent the money to unqualified homeowners.  they packaged up the bad paper and sold it to investment banks and brokerage houses, thus the "great "crash of '08 as the dishonest news media likes to name it!|`|bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa	Yes, yes, yes. Both major parties are owned and corrupt.    The two leading Democrats on the Banking Committee, Chairman Christopher Dodd of Connecticut and Charles Schumer of New York, are among the most favored recipients of campaign cash from big Wall Street interests.  Senator Schumer raised $12,928,000 in the 2003-2008 election cycle, according to the CPR. His top five industries for campaign cash were securities and investment, lawyers and law firms, real estate, miscellaneous finance and commercial banks, from which he netted a total of $3,937,000. His top five contributing firms were Citigroup, UBS, Paul Weiss et al, Kasowitz, Benson et al and Metlife, which funneled a total of $271,000 to his campaigns.  In the course of his political career, Senator Dodd has raised $43,344,000. In the 2003-2008 election cycle his top five industries for campaign funds were securities and investment ($4,268,000), lawyers and law firms, insurance, real estate and commercial banks, for a total of $9,826,000. His top five contributing firms were Citigroup, SAC Capital Partners, United Technologies, Royal Bank of Scotland and the insurance giant (taken over by the government earlier this month) American International Group. His total take from these firms was $1,315,000.  Dodd, who presents himself as the champion of homeowners victimized by the subprime mortgage racket, proposed a housing bill in June of this year that would assist subprime lenders such as Countrywide Financial, the biggest purveyor of such home loans. Countrywide, on the brink of collapse, was bought out by Bank of America last year.    Barney Frank's relations with Wall Streets largest banks and finance houses have stood him in good stead. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, he pulled in $1.8 million in campaign contributions in the run-up to the 2006 election. He is well on his way to substantially topping that figure in the present campaign season, recording $1.2 million in contributions by the end of March(2008). Securities and Investment firms were responsible for $164,600 of that money, real estate interests for $156,401, law firms for $130,768, insurance companies for $117,674 and commercial banks for $74,350.  In return, he has dutifully defended these massive financial interests.|`|yozsPWPZaa	ABSOLUTELY ! lets not forget franklin raines and the rest of the lib pimps.|`|x5RFgh6Qaa	yes but investigations of this kind are purely partisan. the lib majority would never let it happen. instead they will create a bush hating circus and attempt his prosecution. my question is, if they had anything substantial, shouldn't they have attempted impeachment long before his term was over. I smell Hot Air(D).|`|Qbf4KSRUaa	Hell yeah.|`|Hcg2juS7aa	It won't happen. It would get too close to too many other corrupt politicians, and they won't have that.  Obama took more money from fannie and freddie lobbyists than anyone.  He certainly doesn't want them looking into it.

After all, that was their main claim to fame.|`|pnpkJKvpaa	"We all know that CAIR funded much of Obama's campaigning."    No, actually, we *don't* know that. Got any facts?    Didn't think so.    You're lying. You're...a...pathetic...liar.|`|8rvXwx7Qaa	There seems to be a connection with a case in NC with a hate crime prosecution in Oct 08 threatening employees of CAIR headquarters in DC and a letter originating that same month by FBI citing successful prosecution of 5 officials of the Holy Land Foundation for funneling $12.4 million to Hammas. This Foundation had ties to the Founder of CAIR, Nihad Awad, as he was named in a co-indictment for organizing the fund raising for those funds. In the interim, the FBI has reportedly directed severance of relations with the local scattered CAIR offices in the US during review of the Organization, though it has posted no information on the fbi.gov site regarding severance with the CAIR Headquarters in DC. It is noted that Nihad Awad, though Founder, is not involved in day to day operations of CAIR.
5CI2YHoqaa	Actually that statement isn't far from the truth. Labour have played right into the hands of the BNP and it's supporters with their policy of putting the EU first. I'd never thought id see the day that a party so blatantly helps another out. Its very naive & will prove costly for labour to give so many votes away.|`|C5JxA8k0aa	Well yes by overturning a policy of no primary immigration, which had stood for almost thirty years. And by adopting a labour party political doctrine, based on the denunciation of the whole concept of the nation state, sovereignty of the nation state, and the notion that england should remain a country populated chiefly with english people.|`|aJWjqaAPaa	The Best Thing to Hapen to the BNP Is EU Laws|`|gPvOcB6oaa	No the unelected socialists who run the EU who have demanded we open our borders to all the worlds trash and are determined to turn the UK into a underdeveloped  province of a European empire is what swung it for me|`|rsFWSelnaa	He is a godsend for any opposition party|`|QqxrVVnlaa	Well, he certainly hasn't helped but, whenever there's a recession, like now, the racists tend to raise their ugly heads and blame foreigners and immigrants, etc.    The biggest responsibility for the rise of the far right, however, is the economic system of capitalism. It has boom and bust built into it. When we have recessions and downturns the right wing press and governments tend to blame workers and make us pay for it.    Workers should reject the ideas that divide us and unite to protect each others pay and conditions. This means black, white and Asian workers standing together!|`|FavaF3ioaa	Yes! Gordan Brown is so slack.   Given there's an economic crises anywhere there's bound to be more people going right wing.|`|HRCFViataa	I 2nd "The Mock Race see"|`|0j61Cewwaa	My three favourite quotes from Gordon Brown:  1. There'll be no more boom and bust now I'm Prime Minister. (2007)  2. British jobs for British workers. That's what I stand for. (2007)  3. A weak currency results from a weak economy, which in turn is caused by a weak government. (1992)    Now let's see, Mr Brown. Tell me, is our currency weak or strong these days?|`|IK26tmcOaa	No, Gordon is a godsend for the UK, without him at the helm we would be in deep doo doo, if anyone can get the UK back on its feet it is Gordon Brown.|`|2EHpbdwIaa	I reckon him & Tony Blair couldn't do more for the BNP. Theve spent the last 12 years ripping off the majority of the white working classes in Britain by giving their jobs away to foreigners & killing them with taxes, so no wonder some people get fed up & vote BNP as a protest vote. Blair & Brown are actually more to blame for the rise of the BNP than anybody else if you ask me.|`|5O49Otkwaa	No he is the best thing to happen to the Conservatives.|`|sMhEkVYTaa	He is the worst thing ever to happen to the UK. Worse than World War 2. Maybe by bankrupting the country and making immigrants welcome, and making us feel guilty about resenting them, he is a good thing for the BNP.|`|hsyI1DxDaa	Haha, I bet the BNP are absolutely loving how embarrassing Brown is as our Prime Minister.

DNaMIcomaa	Does it seem almost impossible to make them understand what you are asking Cap'n T? It appears that conservatives here cannot make the distinction between blindly following an ideology as Rush and the rest of the right-wing brainwash specialists advocate (I have heard Rush repeatedly state that he does NOT believe in compromise with liberals) and making the compromises necessary to accomplish progress in Washington. We have had partisan-gridlock in Washington for over thirty years and any THINKING person understands that we have made little progress because of it. Barack Obama stated during his campaign that he would work to break that gridlock. Rush Limbaugh and the rest of the right wing haters believe that to break that gridlock that we need one party rule (remember Karl Rove and his "permanent majority"?) and in order to achieve that the GOP has to have the backing of at least some of the middle class electorate, and so the brainwashing continues.The outcome that you stated is only important to hard line conservatives if it is achieved by one of their own.Rush and his listeners just cannot accept that right or left, liberal or conservative,Democrat or Republican, we all want what is best for this country,but disagree with how to get there. Rush listeners need to ask themselves if they truly favor one party rule, or the system of checks and balances (with necessary compromise) that the differing ideologies of both parties have used to keep us from going to extremes for many years.|`|in936M0Faa	I believe that what he means is that Obama will see the error of his policies and change them to ways that will help the country as a whole|`|x5RFgh6Qaa	if obama doesn't centralize the gov't to the federal level and doesn't take control of the health care industry, his policies/proposals have failed but AMERICA will not. We want obama to not destroy the country.|`|NP6ES2GPaa	Obama succeeds if the country doesn't blow up or get attacked or burst into flame or have another financial meltdown.    What Rush is talking about that he wants Obama policies (like Cap & Trade or government funded abortion) to fail.|`|msvyruUSaa	"i want him to fail"  -rush limbaugh talking to sean hannity    what is the context? did he say, "i would be a traitor if i said", "i want him to fail"?  what is the context?|`|ca6c1bac92d16664e751aef99dc02c33aa	i was listening to his program when limbaugh said he wanted obama to fail.  and i was listening when he started back-pedaling, saying, no, no, he meant that he wanted obama's Policies to fail.  not obama. no, no he didn't mean that.      well, it sounded to me like he was being snide when he said he wanted just obama's policies to fail, and not obama.  it seemed plain enough what he meant when i heard him say what he said.    to answer your question, i do not see how obama can succeed if his policies fail.    any attempts to turn the negative thing limbaugh said into something a little more positive is just phony double-speak to me.  and limbaugh knew what he was saying when he said it.|`|yZXe2XLlaa	Simply put, Rush explained that he wants Obama to fail to implement socialism.    Not difficult to understand  no matter which side of the fence you are on,    Personally I am not a Rush fan, I am too liberal for that, and way to conservative for Kieth Olberman... go figure.|`|trZ1NRLbaa	Rush who??? just kidding|`|eFXD3Qzcaa	What he is saying is that if obama's policies succeed it could be harmful to the country, thus saying that he doesn't want his country to fail.|`|Yw7YgG0Kaa	Obama could Stop being a Communist, and succeed.    But his goal is to turn this country into another North Korea.    (Democrats Hate Rush because he encourages them to get off Welfare and Get Jobs.)|`|AA11369432	I do not trust anything that comes out of his mouth.|`|5fabd1dde8996146708da2f18d2feea8aa	The question is whether we will ever reach our goals if we do it his way.     Many of Obamas goals will require huge expenditures that cannot be easily cancelled when the crisis is over.  If we need spending to revive the economy, tax cuts are the way to go. Tax cuts and tax credits for lower income people will be spent.      Obamas plan calls for most of the spending to occur in 2010 and later years.  How will that help us NOW?      Stop thinking about how smart Obama is and look at our problem.  We need more spending NOW, not in 2010 and later years.  Obama talks about how things need to be, not how we are going to get there.    Obama talks a lot about goals, but he never talks about how we are going to achieve those goals.  He needs to stop talking so much about What? and start talking about How?|`|FIXKYCIGaa	I want to know when the same people who are defending Rush, claiming his comments were taken out of context, will criticize his taking other peoples comments out of context.    For someone as supposedly powerful as Rush is, he sure needs a lot of defending.|`|OLCnQkmBaa	Of course try a non America news site Canada reported very fairly.  It was funny there was ugly Obama on the most expensive ad peddling his @ss even in other Countries and Obama is suing others for doing this (selling Obama's @ss)  I guess Photo OP is his term. Obama wants all the dough himself.|`|bBqPja7eaa	Whatever happened to his slogan: CHANGE YOU CAN BELIEVE IN?  He should've said disaster. He won't succeed, with a communist muslim mentality!|`|AA11086243	Rush makes a living out of taking Democrat's comments out of context...    it's all he does...    therefore, I find it highly amusing for him or his followers to complain about the same treatment that he makes his living off of...    while I shouldn't sink to his level, ?really don't have a big problem with people taking his words out of context... the only people that really care are Rush fans...     and they may learn a lesson from it... but I doubt it...|`|LFE0e8Qdaa	What Rush said was if Obama wants to institute socialist policies, he wants him to fail.  Libs will never get the facts from the sources they use.|`|a9fm2ozMaa	Nobody wishes president Obama personally to fail, just his policies. Yes there is a difference in the two. To wish him personally to fail is to say that you do not care what he proposes, just so he fails. To wish his policies to fail is to have taken a look at them and come to the conclusion that they are not good for the country. Therefore. to wish they fail is to wish good for our country.    Here is the actual quote in context that has become so popular now:    "If I wanted Obama to succeed, I'd be happy the Republicans have laid down.  And I would be encouraging Republicans to lay down and support him.  Look, what he's talking about is the absorption of as much of the private sector by the US government as possible, from the banking business, to the mortgage industry, the automobile business, to health care.  I do not want the government in charge of all of these things. I don't want this to work.  So I'm thinking of replying to the guy, "Okay, I'll send you a response, but I don't need 400 words, I need four: I hope he fails."     Read the entire article at the link below and compare it with the bits and pieces that the DNC used in their ads distorting what was said. You are not being asked to agree with Rush on this, just look at what was actually said and compare it to what is being reported that he said and you shall see why people are defending Rush now..|`|AA10317675	I understand your point.    I do not think you are understanding the point Rush was making.      He does not want Obama to impliment a program & then for that program to fail.    He beleives the program will fail, therefore he hopes Obama will fail at implimenting the program.    He is afraid of Obama's socialitic talk (which I am hopeful was just talk)
XRYAfxpTaa	No. With the divided philosophies of the world, it would be impossible. Democracy will not surrender to fascism and Christianity will not yield to Muslim beliefs or rule and vice versa.|`|TfpeYyuwaa	No|`|jjt2enntaa	No. I think it would result in utter chaos and constant upheavals.  It's not good to have too much power in one place.|`|TFdKrkP2aa	Yes, this planet is for all of us.|`|VS0PuI5paa	No, because there would be no where else to move to if the liberals got the kind of power they really want (think Nazi Germany).|`|56db1a8e5fe3dfc4d4fbbbff987d0191aa	Absolutely not.

There was a movie that came out in the mid 70's called Rollerball, where the world was governed by corporations from different countries. Except there were no countries. They had been divided into territories. Rollerball was a game like Roller Derby, except much more violent and had no rules. The object was to kill the other team members while skating and trying to get the ball, which was extremely heavy, away from the other team and in doing so members of the teams were killed one by one. That's how territories fought war. Territory teams would compete with each other and the team that had the most team members alive at the end of the game won the war for their world corporation.    Anyway, I think the concept of a world government is a good one, but with all the differences there are in the world, it be difficult to get to a point of any type of agreement on anything.|`|5lflypTiaa	Sure, if I was in charge.|`|Zye7SfK0aa	it doesnt really matter... because people from different cultures will still fight with each others... one government wont be able to give justice to different cultures in other words they would be forcing one side to convert to another|`|aPtk8iEXaa	NOPE, I will never surcome to ISLAM!|`|yozsPWPZaa	would you support universal slavery...that is one world government.look at the united nations,that should give you a clue.|`|ZHajpMSyaa	Only if the US runs it.|`|wfp6xn5aaa	Absolutely not.  How can a single government oversee the earth if our own corrupted government cannot take care of problems here at home?  Where our freedoms are slowly being stripped away in the name of combating "terrorism"?  Where politicians and bankers and the rich live to satisfy their personal interests instead of those of the people?|`|PGLZ3LiYaa	NO. Look at the corruption in the US government and the UN. don't want one government. If it becomes corrupt, you will have no protection.     There will always be people that think they know what is best for you. They will promise to fix all your problems. They will redistribute the wealth keeping everyone equally poor and hamper prosperity. Then they will always need more for them self. They are elite, they are royalty, you should want them to have more.       This is what limousine liberals are. They preach how you should conserve from their limos and private jets.       Remember the saying "Those who can, do. Those who can't, teach."?  Some people work toward conservation, others talk about it. You think Al Gore of course lives the green life he shames you into wanting and the evil oil Barron G.W Bush burns barrels of oil for fun...    Besides this, the various experiments from different governments provide new ideas to better society. Something the people that want one government and hate capitalism are missing.
IwBIM1tVaa	Obama is going to do such a bad job a dog could run for the GOP.  I mean the only reason Obama won was because Bush had such a low popularity rating.|`|lMKy9Ho8aa	color has nothing to do with it.

But why let facts get in the way of a good narrative.|`|UzRijICuaa	I think you see racism and its effects where it doesn't exist.  Old habit must die hard.  I believe the outcome would be that the next President will be the lesser of all the evils presented to the voters.  I haven't seen ANY good candidates from any party in many decades.|`|VG7k5QRFaa	The racists would vote for the black person they could control.  Examples:  Colin Powell and Condoleeza Rice.  Neither agreed with Bush and yet neither of them tried to convince him that his policies and his plans were foolhardy.  Colin Powell spoke once he escaped from Bush's chains, but Condoleeza is probably too traumatized to speak after her ratings took a beating.      Racists had no problem with Booker T. Washington, Colin Powell and Condoleeza Rice.  They had a problem with Dr. King, Malcolm X, Coretta Scott King, Maya Angelou and Rosa Parks.  Notice that Obama is the one who needed security when he announced his presidential bid.  Obama is the one that is called "Hussein."  Michelle Obama is the one that is called an ape.  Notice that when normal people disagree with a "minority" person's policies they won't focus on their race as the source of the attack...they will focus on the person's policies, their actions, their beliefs, etc.      As for white Independent candidates...    ...People don't know enough about them and they distrust someone that they know little about.  Even racists.  Some might turn to them, but they know the person has no chance of winning.  Therefore, they will focus on the black / Hispanic candidate that has the best chance of winning and that they can control.    As for Jewish people...people are racist against them, but being Jewish doesn't affect if they win or not or isn't a problem when they are chosen to be in a particular office.  Also their being Jewish is never brought up    Examples:  Mayor Bloomberg, Eliot Spitzer, Madeleine Allbright, Rahm Emmanuel, Alan Hevesi, Joe Lieberman.      So racists might rant, but people like Bloomberg would have no problem getting votes.|`|RFEorR5Raa	in 2012 after the Dem's and Obama's disaster, anyone that runs will be elected and color won't be a factor.  i just hope we don't pass it on to our children as FDR did to us.
teKeLxX2aa	Well, considering that its supposedly the most powerful position in the world, it probably couldn't hurt having someone up there who knows a thing or two about politics and how the world works. I've been seeing a lot of online banners boosting that Obama's IQ is around 127, which is bright but not extremely intelligent (Genius is somewhere around 140/150 depending on the IQ test.) However, considering that he graduated from Columbia University and *** laude from Harvard should denounce any idea's that he isn't an intelligent person.     However, a high intelligence quotient isn't necessarily the most detrimental part to being a successful president. There are so many things a president has to look over and make decisions on that he couldn't possibly have an encyclopedia of knowledge on all of them. That's why presidents get to choose their cabinet, so that they can get knowledgeable advice from experts on an array of fields. I believe a presidents personal discretion in deciding who is the most qualified and experienced in a specific field is more important than raw intelligence. If you want to be a good president, you need to find people who's expertise can be applied for the common good of the country, instead of appointing friends or allies who share similar party beliefs. For as much bad talk that Bush got for being stupid, he still could have done a halfway decent job if he had intelligent individuals in his cabinet to give him advice on the issues (not scumbags like Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheyney).    Another important factor to consider is how well a president can negotiate and mediate with the other party in order to put things through congress and pass them into laws. For as much as I liked Ron Paul, his personality and unwavering Libertarian beliefs would've put our congress to a standstill, because he wouldn't of been able to find a middle ground between the left and right politicians. It is unfortunate that most people in congress will make up their mind before they hear the issue, but for the few who can be reasoned with its important to have a president who knows when to lean and when to push for legislative measures.     But perhaps even more important is having a president who cares about the average, everyday hardworking American people. Someone who can empathize and takes their problems and issues seriously, then tries to mediate a solution that falls somewhere between a conservative and progressive agenda. If we had a president in 2000 that was more concerned with serving his country than the interests himself and his own kind, we wouldn't be in the predicament we're in today.|`|56650a55637223b1b968b4235bb50735aa	Unfortunately, "extremely intelligent" people are unlikely to run for political office. It offers little monetary remuneration, and it requires an ego beyond the realms of most rational individuals. Additionally, many of those you would consider within your category have a specialized intelligence that often doesn't translate well into leadership. Most of our presidents have been highly educated, that doesn't always mean intelligent. Our current chief executive epitomizes this.|`|sAuB8vLCaa	AH   UM   UM   AH   UM   UM, The writers have got to keep up.|`|wVik8Fo7aa	Yes.

You obviously have no idea what you are talking about.    I love how people paint Obama as an "eloqunt" speaker.  I have never heard so many "ummmmsss", and "ohhhhhssss" from someone so eloquent.    He is not as intelligent from a purely educational background either.  Sure he went to an Ivy league school but he refuses to release transcripts.  Did you ever stop to wonder why?    Intelligence, by design is open minded.  What has Obama done to indicate that he is open minded.  He is a far left liberal acting as a far left liberal.  Not changing, not accepting of other positions.  At least not yet.  That may change, but he is being who he has always been.    Sorry, your assertion is dead wrong on both counts.|`|13920962b7119a1b4d44ad9700a88994aa	He recites a good speech that others write for him and that doesn't make him intelligent.

He was extremely intelligent. He was also a cannibal and serial killer.  Most serial killers have been very intelligent.  Hitler was supposed to have had an IQ of 148.

They made plans to go on a expensive Ski trip(retreat) with the money  Obama was outraged and made the  public aware of this   Think ! an ignorant president would listen to his advisors without questioning their motives or actions  GREED is cause of most of America's pain & suffering  CEO's business going under & they vote for bonuses or buy garbage cans that cost thousands of dollars  I work hard, have student loans, car loan, have a mortage,taxes went up, food, clothing & gas prices have increased a job loss would crush me & my family  In the past the rich in office have forgotten about the middle class|`|tMY4iTlVaa	Not necessarily. It's not a good thing to have an extremely intelligent, morally bankrupt president. Because then he'll just be all that better at screwing over his constituents. At least with Bush, he was so stupid it was obvious, at least to the more intelligent of us, that he was messing up.    Oh and I should add, that wasn't a shot at Obama in any way. Personally, I think he'll be an excellent president because he has the intelligence and the morality to back it up. I look forward to seeing what he does, ignore the morons who make stupid comments like Osama Obama (remember, they were likely the fools who voted for Bush to take a 2nd term), and just don't expect him to be a miracle worker. It takes a lot to fix a problem than it takes to cause it.|`|x5RFgh6Qaa	and??? are you alluding to bush? he's gone you know.|`|AA11558024	Well those are not opposite. I think that both Bush and Obama are intelligent - they went to Ivys. Bush was horrible at expressing himself, Obama is the most eloquent speaker many of us have ever seen in our lifetimes.

ucYwexwJaa	We are not all equals, that much is clear.  Men have been making more money for the same job for years now.  Also, when it comes to who we should be listening to, I would pay more attention to people who have degrees, PhD's in their resume, and years and years of experience "on the job" rather than some kid that just got out of Junior College.  Obvioiusly when the President speaks, everyone listens because it's usually aired on all 4 major channels.  When your local mayor speaks people usually stop talking to hear what he has to say.  Is this making sense?  People in posititions of experience and authority are usually given priority over "regular" people.|`|grKtTRYtaa	So you think your voice should be given more weight?

gasquENMaa	Hello Tay Tay. I could literally go on for hours on this topic, having seen the changes in the system over the last 20 years, but I will touch on the highlights.    Under the old Crime and Punishment ( called Civil Death) that was used until the mid 70's, inmates had NO rights. They were kicked off the face of the planet when convicted. They had to work in prison factories, producing goods that were sold on the market to help reduce the public burden of their incarceration. This also taught them to be responsible. Getting up at 6 am and working 8 hours a day. No civil amenities, barest minimum of any non essentials. It literally forced the convict to reconsider his ways and he literally rehabilitated himself so that he would not return to prison again. Under the old system, recidivism was 15%.    Now the liberals started taking over in the mid 70's. The prison workshops were torn down. Convicts ( now called "inmates" so as not to offend them) sit around all day watching 60 inch color tv's on cable vision, working out in the supplied prison gym or sitting in the state supplied legal library researching their cases, praying to find a loophole to overturn their cases. (I have never met one that was innocent,,,,but they all look for that mistake made in the legal system so they file their free motions to get out).     Inmates now also research prior lawsuits. We have jail house "lawyers" who file one or two motions a day ( since it doesn't cost them a dime to do so, they are free to continue writing them forever). They literally grab at straws trying to find a lawsuit that might possibly stick and they can win a couple of thousand taxpayer's dollars for nothing. A few examples of lawsuits that were filed at my institution: One inmate claimed the stainless steel toilet inflamed his hemmorhoids, causing pain and suffering: $50,000 suit. Overturned. Another inmate claimed our chow hall only served smooth peanut butter and his system demanded chunky peanut butter, thereby causing his digestive system to hurt severely. $25,000 for pain and suffering. Overturned.     You might find this amusing, but consider that each and every lawsuit filed MUST be judged and looked at for validity, thereby costing the American taxpayer millions of dollars a year nationally and hopelessly tieing up our legal system in the process. Meantime, they sit and think up new lawsuits every single day since they have absolutely nothing else to do.    We have mandated rehabilitative classes and programs now. Inmates are offered GED and full 4 year college degrees at absolutely NO charge to them at all. With all this massive costing education being thrown at the inmates, our recidivism rate today is an astounding 84% and it doesn't show any signs of slowing up.    There is little punishment to the inmate for misbehaving while incarcerated. I am constantly called every name under the sun.Unless they lay their hands on me to attack , there is nothing I can do. As the Correction Officer, I am fully expected to be the "professional" and not answer nor respond to vulgar language, racial slurs and inuendos. If I say anything at all in return, I am brought up on departmental charges and face punitive actions.     Today's inmate literally sits around doing nothing at all. He does not attempt to take advantage of the rehabilitative classes and programs. He does not learn any positive habits, such as getting up and going to work at set times each day so when he is released, he stands a chance to work gainfully and not reoffend and return to prison. The prison system today is not viewed with any trepidation and the inmates are not afraid of coming back, which is why our recidivism is 84%.     We have literally turned the prison system into a cottage industry with job security.     If you truly want to see prisons work successfully, bring back the workshops. Take away the color tvs and super rec periods. Take away the "rights" of the convicted felon and give those rights back to the victims of crime, where they belong. Make prison life HARSH again. Force the offender to reconsider his ways. Then you will see the recidivism rate drop down to what it used to be.    I hope this helps and you can find it useful    Source(s):  20 years as a Corrections Officer in a max prison|`|rUNlmQG5aa	Since we have the largest per capita prison population by far in the world perhaps some questions about leniency could be addressed like no TV's, for starters and plenty of books made available to all. With written tests for points in order to be released early- like paying kids for good grades. Work a minimum of five 8 hour days per week- often the reason so many end up there to begin with. Down right cruelty is not the answer but some gainful activities should be encouraged- TV not being one of them.|`|2cIKIbYmaa	They aren't too lenient. And educating prisoners is one of the ways of reducing the chance that they'll come back. That prevents crime and it saves money -- it's costly to imprison someone. How smart is that?|`|EW1g3VDnaa	Here is a hypothetical situation for you. Take an animal, say, a dog. Put him in a cage all day, everyday. Give  him his basic needs (water, food) and take everything else from him. Toys, treats, human affection). Do that for 5 years. Now let it out. What do you think that dog will do? Not only would it destroy your house, it would most likely be a little pissed off at you.    When you give inmates something to do and be constructive of their time (jobs, education) and give them entertainment like tv and playing pool, they get distracted. They have 24 hours a day to think about what they can do and what they can make and where they can hide it. If you keep them occupied, there are less fights, less drugs, and an easier time for everyone.    If you give them an education and a trade, they can become positive members of society when they get out.|`|rUn7TyQPaa	They teach spelling.
AA11195316	Well, we the people have a new president. Its an exciting time for Americans, whether or not you agree with President Barack Obamas plans. My hope is that our new president will instill some confidence in people, not necessarily set out to fix everybody and everything.     There are some bogus government strategies floating around to stimulate the economy and "save us from ourselves." Just because theyre all everyone talks about doesnt make them true! Here are a few of the big issues:     Tax Breaks  These arent bad, and I would never turn them down. But to think that tax breaks single-handedly stimulate the economy is laughable. Remember last fall? Those stimulus checks didnt fix the problem, so what makes us think its going to fix everything this time? Did you know it was your money to start with? Theyre just giving it back to you and making you feel good about it. If youre looking for $1,000 to change your life this year, you obviously dont have a life to start with!    It may help you today or this month, but $1,000 will do very little for you in the long run. To win with money, you've got to think long term.    Patriotic Duty  The government wants you to spend, spend, spendand many Americans are taking this advice while still in debt! No matter what the talking heads say, it is not your patriotic duty to spend money you dont have. Your duty is to take care of yourself and your household with the money you earn from an honest days work.    If you have your full emergency fund and are in a position to buy something, now is the perfect time! You can get some fabulous deals, but dont let the deals entice you if you havent planned ahead and dont have the cash!    National Deficit  The dog is still chasing its tail.     Debt started the problem, so what is the current plan to fix the problem? More debt!  What really drives the economy? Is it D.C.'s programs or small-business people scattered throughout the country? This down economic time will begin to heal itself. Do we have to go $1 trillion in debt to do that? No way!    The good news is that our future as an economy isnt coming out of Washington. Our future prosperity is coming out of the hopes, dreams and individual freedoms of the American people. When left alone, we have a tendency to prosper.     The healing of the economy will begin and end with you. Yes, you, the person you see in the mirror! You have to make your decision as to whether or not youre going to take part in the recession.    As for our new president, if youre not a fan, pray for him. Hes your president. If you are a fan, pray for him. Hes your president, not your savior. Your hope will be crushed if you wait for him and his administrationor anyone elseto fix your life and give you money.      good luck|`|pnpkJKvpaa	I guess you don't want your tax cut...|`|vFHXrOHNaa	I just heard on the Wolf Blitzer show that the first stimulus package is delayed till second week of the February.

When the government increases spending, they issue securities known as treasuries.  If the Fed buys the treasury, they print money...    If China, Japan, or ourselves buy it, it's cash already in existence.    We've actually been in deflation with credit markets.  Hence the lending freeze.|`|yozsPWPZaa	not to worry,china has state of the art presses.

GNX9bQUWaa	An accurate answer cannot be provided without additional information.  If the matter is brought in one of the 77 district courts (county courthouses) in Oklahoma, then you are probably charged under Okla. Stat. tit. 47, Section 11-801 (2008), which provides that the fine for 16-20 over is $35.00; however, this does not include court costs and other fees which are always added in.  With all of that added in, the minimum I have seen for under 10 over the speed limit is $183.50.    If the matter is not brought in a district court, then it is brought in one of the many, many municipal courts in the State of Oklahoma.  Each city has its own ordinances with would determine the fines and costs associated with a speeding ticket.    As far as points, 16 over will add two points being added on your license.  At 10 points (within five years), a driver's license will be suspended.  Additionally speeding over 10 over will be reported to your insurance and increase your costs.      To be the most frugal over time, I would recommend that you not pay the ticket without some plea negotiation.  Retain an attorney and see if you can get it reduced to 10 over.  This is a reasonable goal and would prevent it from being reported on insurance.|`|1NnCUB12aa	my husban was doing 100 in a 70 and he got a ticket of 267.00|`|ceQqYxtnaa	...your looking at the loss of possibly up to $300.00 not including points on your license and maybe some sort of traffic school...|`|XRYAfxpTaa	When tickets are issued by an OHP trooper.  Miles per hour exceeding speed limit:  1-10 - $183.50  11-15 - $221.50  16-20 - $236.50  21-25 - $276.50  26-30 - $336.50  31-35 - 356.50  over 36 - $406.50    Fines in a construction zone range from $221.50 to $611.50.     Municipal fines can vary. 19 miles over in OKC would be approximately $192.

RKLce4ltaa	Many electric and gas utilities are not government owned.  Libertarians have no problem with shareholder owned companies.  I own shares of Duke Energy and Spectra Energy myself.  The private sector is also capable of owning water fountains and bathrooms.    Water and sewage are generally government controlled.  Libertarians may not like that, but it's probably not that big an issue with them compared to gun rights and "victimless crimes".|`|AA10079277	I think government should provide the basics.  The ones you listed are definitely basic, along with protecting citizens and the borders.|`|Wcjc8Au1aa	It depends on how radical the Libertarian is.  I'm what I would call a "reasonable" Libertarian, and I have no problem with the government regulating, or even running, anything that is a "natural monopoly."  However, in my opinion (and in the opinion of most Libertarians), liberals and even conservatives are far too anxious to label as a monopoly any business whose behavior they disapprove of.  There are quite a few businesses (long-distance phone companies come to mind) that were once regarded as natural monopolies, but then when the regulations were relaxed, it turned out that there were lots of competitors waiting in the wings.  Immediately, prices came down and quaility improved.|`|rUNlmQG5aa	Like so many reasonable sounding ideologies it may look great on paper- has anyone ever run a state or city, town even, an outhouse, perhaps, based upon this model?|`|wQ5LKysaaa	All Americans who have had the chance to visit any other country on the face of this planet would have to know how blessed we are to have access to the unparalleled infrastructure afforded us by the government, regardless of political affiliation.    Libertarians are progressive thinkers; they are not for no government at all (like some may think).  On the contrary, they are for limited government.  Some things, such as public utilities are highly important to the strength and functioning of a nation as a whole.  Therefore, I would assume that they would have an even deeper appreciation of the significance of these public services.
LX6AQ4kuaa	You have to remove the conditions on your green card jointly with your husband. It depends many factors whether you need an interview or not. If the initial documentation is not sufficient, that's when you're called for an interview because the USCIS wants to see if your marriage is genuine. I heard it's good if you have statements from friends claiming that they know you as a married couple but other supporting evidence such as pictures taken together, bank statements, properties together are also necessary. If you have a child together, send his or her birth certificate, that's the best proof. After you're done with the removal, you'll be granted a GC valid for 10 years (it is renewable though). You have to file 90 days prior to the 2nd anniversary of you becoming a LPR.|`|62f16dd680be1db7598eb6b8faaa8e4faa	Do you attend another marriage interview to remove conditional status in two years? YES  But you must apply for that as others have told you.     What will you need to bring do both parties attend or just the petitioning party? Usually BOTH must attend    Do you need statements from friends?  These may help but you need other proof as well.   if you have kids, you must send in copies of their birth certificates - that is the best proof    You will be questioned seperately and your answers must jive or match each other. You will be asked question of a personal and private nature, because CIS need to know that your marriage is REAL.     questions like   what side of the bed do you sleep on,   what kind of toothpaste does he use?     etc etc.|`|MeeJWmGtaa	2 years and minus 90 days from having received your conditional green card, you'll have to file for removal of conditions. You'll HAVE to, or your status as legal resident is removed, and your subject to removal. (USCIS form I-751).  It's gonna be pretty much the same as your recent AOS interview: so bring documentation that you ARE living as a married couple.  Passing that interview will gain you permanent (as opposed to conditional) resident status, and your new GC will be valid ten years. However 3 years after you got your GC (i.e. 3 years from now, assuming you just got your conditional), you may apply for US citizenship.|`|cdpBdzZtaa	You have to file I-751 and supporting documents(yes statements from friends is part of documentation),if you are lucky you will get new green card without interview or you both may have to attend for interview.
AA11494150	There is no agency that outranks the other, because they have totally separate functions.    US Marshals have three responsibilities: Security for federal courts, transportation of federal prisoners, and serving federal warrants. They are not an investigative agency.     The FBI is an investigative agency, and has jurisdiction over violations of federal law only.     The Sheriff has countywide jurisdiction for violations of state and local laws.|`|367926de3fa96492022d3fae80bbab42aa	Police Departments derive their power from city charters and/or city constitutions. A police Chief is usually appointed (hired) by either a Mayor or a City Council. They can be fired at will by who appointed them. The police department is considered local law enforcement because they serve the local populance. The police department usually only patrols the incorporated limits or city limits. The responsibilities of a police department are not usually as big as the Sheriffs Office. Police departments, depending on the size and population they serve, can have many different division such as traffic, vice, homicide, SWAT, etc. or be a small department that doesn't have that much in terms of specialized police operations. Police deparments do not typically operate jails or do court room security however this is dependent on the particular area of the country. In the eastern section of the U.S. they typically don't unless it's a large metropolitan area and then the jails are small and most inmates will be transferred to a County Jail. In the Southwest of the U.S. it's different. Cities do operate their own jails such as Las Vegas, Henderson and North Las Vegas.      The Office of the Sheriff is usually created by the constitution or charter of the respective county. A Sheriff is an elected position and has to run for office. The Sheriff can be removed from office but only under similar process as you have seen the Governor of Illinoise removed. The Sheriff is responsible for providing law enforcement services for his/her county. This includes police services such as sheriff deputies that patrol in a variety of functions such as motorized (cruisers), mounted (on horses) and usually have a marine division that patrols the lakes and/or rivers of the county area. Typically the deputies patrol areas that are not already patroled by local police deparresponsibility is not always true since in large metropolitan areas such as Detroit Michigan there are no areas that are not patrolled by local police. In this instance the jurisdiction is shared. Another major responsiblility of the Sheriffs Office is to provide correctional services for the county. This is a holding facility typically used to hold misdemeanor convictions and to house those charged with a felony. Once convicted of a felony they would be moved to the jurisdiction of the State Corrections department to either be sent to prison or any other program the State uses such as probation, etc. The County Sheriff usually provides the court room security at the court house in most places. And lastly, the Sheriffs Office may operate the 911 and police communications for that area.    The United States Marshals are a federal law enforcement department. They are typically in charge of court security for federal courts, provide correctional service for holding suspects going through the federal criminal judicial process and also serve federal warrants and are search for fugitives from federal courts.    The Federal Bureau of Investigations is the main investigative department for the Federal government. They investigate major crimes for the United States such as bank robberies, computer crimes, etc.|`|c07v7O80aa	There is no ranking. Deputy U.S. Marshals work for the Marshal Service. There is one U.S. Marshal in each federal judicial district, and the deputies work for them. Their primary mission of court security, federal prisoner transport, and fugitive apprehension. F.B.I. Special Agents work for, obviously, the F.B.I., headed up by the Director. The Marshals and the F.B.I. are both in the Justice Department. Sheriff's are elected officials of counties. Most have a law enforcement role and are heads of their agencies. In some states, they are just the county jailer. Sheriff's and their deputies are state officers and do not enforce federal law. F.B.I. Special Agents and U.S. Marshals may or may not be recognized as peace officers in a state. They deal strictly in federal law, which sometimes overlaps state law (bank robbery, for instance), but may work with state officers on a case or in a task force. But none of them ranks another.

Kudos!    * * *  To a later respondent:  I think it is a tragicomedy (see source links) that the recent election had the mob elect the Usurper, Obama. More than a tragi-comedy, a dark comedy, an absurdist dark comedy.      Will the play end as a tragedy?  Or will the dramatic mix end on a comedic note, with the name, Obama, used as the punch line of perennial jokes throughout the 21st century?    We shall see, but we also seem to have very tragic middle acts ahead of us, unless sanity miraculously returns to our culture quickly,  unless G-d saves us all, so is my hope that he does.    And for myself I am made happy, and hopeful -- real HOPE, that -- to see a young person too young yet to vote see the Usurper clown for what he is.  Kudos to asker laughingoutloud542!    * * *  [a day later]    I see the rabid emotionalists have voted even more negatively for respondent Nurse.  Well, lads and laddies, good Nurse is wiser than the four of you!   Now go back to polishing your Obama idols, and lighting candles before his image.  Please either let the sane run the country, or grow up.|`|oTqZm4NFaa	What experience do you need to be president exactly?  No offence but I think Bush proved just about anyone can be president..  What experience does McCain have...?.. apart from being a war hero.|`|wULUGKzVaa	Absolutely ZERO, but he talks a good game and that's enough.|`|g0lKlQGnaa	Almost nothing, and all of his supporters know that too, it's just a plain fact|`|Ic1u6INRaa	umm, hellooo!  that was soo, like 3 mts ago.... lol  ppl were saying that when they were still carryin hope that he might lose.  We are so, totally over that one!|`|fbe600962a1348933b552a6e772b27b2aa	To be fair, unless you have been president for at least one term, you don't have any experience. But I am thinking mostly in terms of "transferable skills" where he sucks - no doubt! I also do not agree with the answerer who said that Bush proved anyone can be a president. More like, Obama does that. He has no skills, he's 35, and not US citizen, but he managed to by-pass the system on a fluke and he's 'considered' US citizen... There's a lawsuit against the Congress to remove president Obama from the White House, on account that he did not prove with sufficient evidence that he's in fact a US citizen. The article is posted on today's issue of WorldNetDaily. I hope they do get an answer, either proof without a shaddow of doubt that Obama is in fact qualified to be president according to the Constitution, or that he's not. We have to get past this. I do not understand what's the hush hush? Steele has no problem showing his BC. has he? McCain didn't have an issue with that, why is there the conspiracy about Obama's BC?   But, to answer your question, the decisions he's making these days, and the impulsiveness with which he's acting upon his ideas, and the arrogance that he's portraying and all the other character flaws he's displaying, he comes out as infantile and unprepared. No skills, but enough stupidity to pretend he's got them. All that makes for a recipe for disaster. Agree?|`|mZi7R0Enaa	Kind of hard to *repect* someone with no *credits* to his name other than terrorists as friends, an American hating preacher and Socialist views!|`|LnoyylQ7aa	erm more than the people voting|`|8052a63d386f57a5453412aecd1de123aa	You know, I'm gonna say this and I really don't care if it offends anyone BUT   PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA  has truly exhibited a very cool head when confronted with a bunch of stupid, nonsensical, idiotic questions either by those morons in the media, (mainly those youngsters on CNN & FOX cable channels who truly don't know when to shut up)   AND  I think, irregardless of him, his background OR his race,  that he has done an exceptional job THUS far and frankly,  now that he IS our President,  I'm hoping and praying like all the other responsible citizens who recognize this important fact:   He IS our President,  What he says goes,  and God speed with all his decisions!   I think that with his level of humility and as he puts it:   "I'm just a mutt as well"    I truly think he's proven himself very level-headed and cool when it comes to dealing with all the opposition against him!   Get over the anger and animosity and give the MAN (yes, I said MAN!)  a chance.   AND,  if you really want the whole truth,  I give him a tremendous amount of credit in lieu of all the negaitivity he's received regarding his aspirations to that most honored office.  He's handled things thus far quite well!  Leave him alone,  Do you think YOU could do any better!?  Get a grip!   AND believe it or not,  there's a whole lot of people who didn't vote for him who are actually pulling for him now!   Gee, what a turn of events!  Very telling!|`|25faf33e24f40cd4a39b1314c62123a4aa	None, But people and their "cult" like behavior will follow and believe whatever Obama wants to shove down America's throat.|`|PHpKo5hZaa	None of our presidents had been president before being elected.|`|TZz1uPY2aa	What experience would you expect him to have?

He had all the right experience he needed to get 70 million people to vote for him.  That's what matters.

Kh4p4gPXaa	Your brother committed a violent crime,  and the police arrived at his address to pick him up.   They have the right to search and make sure he isn't there.       Short answer,  you can help him by advising he call a lawyer and get real legal advice.   Turning himself in is a good step,  it looks good to take responsibility for your actions,  but make sure you have legal council before you do.    Whatever you do,  do not hide him or lie to the police about his whereabouts.    Doing so will make you an accessory,  and you can be charged with a crime.   Don't let him drag you down with him.|`|P9oP8CS9aa	Tell him to stop hitting girls.|`|zH1sg3Xraa	Well, you can help your brother grow up and to learn to respect women and to not hit on them. Also, you can help your brother to respect authority and to respect and obey the law. By telling a lie to the police, you are not helping your brother to grow up and to be a man. If he broke the law, he should be man enough to turn himself in and to face the consequences. It is best to voluntarily turn yourself in as they will eventually find who they are looking for and then it will look worse. It is best to cooperate.|`|qdw3ZOYFaa	It is better for your brother and it will look better in court if he turns himself in. Then what you should do is to obtain the police report of the charge under Freedom of Information in order to see the circumstances under which your brother was charged and arrested|`|AA10925759	As others said he best turn himself in. They will catch him eventually. He could get pulled over for a ticket 3 years from now and still get arrested. And since it is his ex she knows where he works, where he goes, where he works and all of that.    If he turns himself in it will show the judge that he is taking responsibility so he might go lighter on him. He might get anger management and probation..... but that depends.    He will want to turn himself in quick. If they can't find him a judge may go ahead and grant a restraining order. Bad news for him to be in court when he already has a restraning order.    If the police pick him up bail could be way expensive or be denied altogether. If he turns himself in the magistrate may set the bail lower. Or he might even be release him with no bail since it will show the magistrate that he might be responsible enough to show in court.    Getting mad at the police does not help him. It will all show in reports. You could get in trouble as well. And the police are just doing their job. They are are just told to go get someone and the courts sort it out.    So yes you can help him. Tell him to have zero contact with the ex. No calls, no texts and no emails either. And tell him to go turn himself in first thing Monday morning. Earlier in the day is best.|`|NHecGoGaaa	Ah... it would be better if he turned himself in rather than to get caught by the cops.. The police will be more easy on him that way.. even tho Domestic Violence is still serious... the best thing he can do is turn himself in..     Good luck!!..|`|56b2673c86699181557ab8de443fae51aa	It will look better in the eyes of the court if he turns himself in. Remember that just because he charged does not mean his is guilty. That is the courts decision to make. It sometimes can make bonding out of jail easier and cheaper.    http://www.tjconnerassociates.com|`|RRFbDou9aa	You can start by cooperating with the police.  If you choose to hide him you might find it hard to help bail him out if you're sitting in the cell next to him.

DTSUJe2oaa	Chester "Chet" Arthur Stiles (born 1970? in Louisville, Kentucky[1]) is an American who gained notoriety after he was alleged to have appeared in video clips of himself raping and sexually abusing a girl who was two years old at the time. The video was made in 2003 but only appeared on the internet in September 2007. Based in Las Vegas, Nevada, both the FBI and the Las Vegas police launched a nationwide manhunt which led to his capture.[2] He was caught and appeared in court on October 17, 2007.~

AA11195316	Well, we the people have a new president. Its an exciting time for Americans, whether or not you agree with President Barack Obamas plans. My hope is that our new president will instill some confidence in people, not necessarily set out to fix everybody and everything.     There are some bogus government strategies floating around to stimulate the economy and "save us from ourselves." Just because theyre all everyone talks about doesnt make them true! Here are a few of the big issues:     Tax Breaks  These arent bad, and I would never turn them down. But to think that tax breaks single-handedly stimulate the economy is laughable. Remember last fall? Those stimulus checks didnt fix the problem, so what makes us think its going to fix everything this time? Did you know it was your money to start with? Theyre just giving it back to you and making you feel good about it. If youre looking for $1,000 to change your life this year, you obviously dont have a life to start with!    It may help you today or this month, but $1,000 will do very little for you in the long run. To win with money, you've got to think long term.    Patriotic Duty  The government wants you to spend, spend, spendand many Americans are taking this advice while still in debt! No matter what the talking heads say, it is not your patriotic duty to spend money you dont have. Your duty is to take care of yourself and your household with the money you earn from an honest days work.    If you have your full emergency fund and are in a position to buy something, now is the perfect time! You can get some fabulous deals, but dont let the deals entice you if you havent planned ahead and dont have the cash!    National Deficit  The dog is still chasing its tail.     Debt started the problem, so what is the current plan to fix the problem? More debt!  What really drives the economy? Is it D.C.'s programs or small-business people scattered throughout the country? This down economic time will begin to heal itself. Do we have to go $1 trillion in debt to do that? No way!    The good news is that our future as an economy isnt coming out of Washington. Our future prosperity is coming out of the hopes, dreams and individual freedoms of the American people. When left alone, we have a tendency to prosper.     The healing of the economy will begin and end with you. Yes, you, the person you see in the mirror! You have to make your decision as to whether or not youre going to take part in the recession.    As for our new president, if youre not a fan, pray for him. Hes your president. If you are a fan, pray for him. Hes your president, not your savior. Your hope will be crushed if you wait for him and his administrationor anyone elseto fix your life and give you money.      good luck|`|4Vmlf902aa	I swear i've answered this exact question before.

He can be in his bathing suit, having scrambled out of the pool to chase you, in his own car, when you went speeding by, for all that matters, so long as he has identification that he is, indeed, a duly appointed member of the constabulary.  That is, obviously, an extreme exaggeration, but trying to argue a ticket is invalid because an officer isn't wearing his cap is the very epitome of ridiculous arguments.|`|207dFmdHaa	sorry, but it doesnt matter if he was wearing his hat....he could of stopped you in his own car wearing street clothes if he wanted, pay the ticket if you were wrong, fight it if you werent wrong|`|4eLzY2hfaa	sure you can if you can get it off of his head without getting tazed!|`|LGidAYDwaa	I don't know where you heard that, but it's not true.

It was a hick town with obsolete equipment, and I *still* lost!)|`|pkjADvNRaa	That is not a viable excuse as far as due process or being employed with regard to just an absent hat. A technical reason to get out of a ticket would be something like...."Paced speed" "Officer no show" "Mechanical failure" "No sign posted" etc.....Any of these apply to you?|`|3BhXf5MYaa	Go ahead and try it.

Therefore, evidence collected by unreasonable search and seizure is also protected under "The Exclusionary Rule," and may not be admissible in court.
AA12071655	Depends on the state and the details (weapon? No weapon? Serious injury? Robbery involved?).     In the US there are two kinds of court: assault is one of many crimes tried in State court. Each state can vary greatly in different ways so there are fifty answers (mostly similar) to your question.    The other court is federal but unless the victim was a federal official (which includes a postman) this case would not go in front of a federal court.    Simple assault (no weapon and no serious injury) would be 2-10 years in Texas assuming the people don't have a previous criminal record.|`|AA10079277	depends on which state (state laws) and the specifics of the case.|`|RgblqqxIaa	If no weapon was involved and the victim only suffered minor injuries then it would likely be along the lines of 30 days in jail and/or $1,000 fine.  The severity of the crime is always a factor.  The two aggressors could, however, be subject to a civil lawsuit from the victim for assault on top of the criminal charges.|`|oOR511mFaa	Depends on which state they committed the crime in.|`|9gsm05lnaa	Similar thing happened to a friend.

Once you graduate from college you have to be hired by a US company in order to stay in this country.    Remember the US has a quota system and only a certain amount of Visas are given out to each country each year.  And now with so many companies down sizing their payrolls a lot of people are being recalled to their own countries.    You need to check with the US embassy in your country to find out what Visas are available and how long the wait list is.
TGPTu1Suaa	There are several choices, but the most likely charge would be Penal Law 221.10 since you'd be in public:       221.05 Unlawful possession of marihuana.      A  person  is  guilty  of  unlawful  possession  of  marihuana when he    knowingly and unlawfully possesses marihuana.      Unlawful possession of marihuana is a violation punishable only  by  a    fine  of not more than one hundred dollars. However, where the defendant    has previously been convicted of an offense defined in this  article  or    article   220   of  this  chapter,  committed  within  the  three  years    immediately preceding such violation, it shall be punishable (a) only by    a fine of not more than  two  hundred  dollars,  if  the  defendant  was    previously  convicted  of one such offense committed during such period,    and (b) by a fine of not more than two hundred fifty dollars or  a  term    of  imprisonment not in excess of fifteen days or both, if the defendant    was previously convicted of two  such  offenses  committed  during  such    period.     221.10 Criminal possession of marihuana in the fifth degree.      A  person  is  guilty of criminal possession of marihuana in the fifth    degree when he knowingly and unlawfully possesses:      1. marihuana in a public place, as defined in section 240.00  of  this    chapter, and such marihuana is burning or open to public view; or      2.  one  or  more  preparations,  compounds,  mixtures  or  substances    containing  marihuana  and  the  preparations,  compounds,  mixtures  or    substances are of an aggregate weight of more than twenty-five grams.      Criminal  possession  of  marihuana  in  the fifth degree is a class B    misdemeanor.|`|jsS03HSNaa	I think you get fined, but I wouldn't know.  I have never been dumb enough to try.|`|RgblqqxIaa	Most likely would be Possession.  If more than a certain amount, however, you can be charged with Intent to Distribute, which is a more serious offense.  Bail in that case would probably be determined by a judge.  You would likely get some jail time depending on if it was your first offense and where you had the drugs (more time if near a school usually).|`|0e539871ad8eb4b77f7ddc8a1e19fd53aa	possession...I do not think you go to the Tombs for it they just give you a ticket and you get a court date. Anything heavier and they will take you with them.|`|AA11899452	You must share your stash with the cop who busted you.|`|NHecGoGaaa	its mostly on what your preference is for payment... either you have more money than time, make bail.. or more time than money, spend a couple of days in jail. Possession is a crime.. usually gets more complicated depending on the circumstances (the amount of marijuana on you, the area you're in,etc..)      Good Luck with that!!!

So, you will have been charged with a delinquent act, which would be a felony if committed by an adult.    Second, juveniles can indeed be charged with felonies, but that is only reserved for the most serious crimes such as murder and rape.  That is not going to happen in this case, unless you had a semi-truck load full of drugs.    Third, in most situations, juveniles that are accused of drug related offenses are generally placed on probation.  Basically, instead of going to juvenile prison, the Court will give you an opportunity to go through treatment, do some community service, and get some additional counselling.    In my experience, most juveniles who have drug related offenses are looking at 6-9 months of supervised probation.  You will have to submit to random drug tests (urine tests), you will likely have to go through a drug and alcohol assessment and if the counsellors say you need to, you will probably have to go to an out-patient drug treatment programme.  If you have serious drug related issues, you might even go to residential treatment.    Finally, once you complete probation, your record will go into a "restricted access" which basically means that only law enforcement and the Courts will be able to tell that you have a juvenile record.  If you stay out of trouble for a few more months, you can ask for your record to be sealed, which means, not even law enforcement can see your record.  (Of course, your record will always be there, it never gets erased, and if you really mess up they could unseal your records).    One last thing, you may be able to get something called deferred prosecution.  It is a little easier than probation, and basically means you just have to do some counselling, and stay out of trouble for 6 months or so.  If you do, that they will dismiss the case and you won't even have a juvenile record.    ------------------    Another thing, given that you don't have any prior juvenile record you are a prime candidate for either DP (Deferred Prosecution) or Standard Probation.  Just relax, as your situation is not all that uncommon and the whole purpose of juvenile justice is to keep you from going to prison.  As PO's we don't want to see you become an adult in prison, so we work hard to keep you out.    Make sure you get copies of your grades and attendance records.  Get any letters of recommendation from teachers you can.  When you do go to Court wear a suit and tie ... (if male, or a nice dress) if female.

PWvS7vqPaa	Two reasons.    Often people do not know their rights and they feel that they must cooperate.  Other times they think they may just get lucky and he won't find whatever it is they are hiding.    The other reason is that people are inherently traited with an "eager to please" type of nature.  They always want to show that they are trying to be cooperative and want to appear to not be suspicious.  They feel that if they say no, then it will make the officer suspect that there is something wrong.  In some cases, they may think that if they agree to a search, the officer may just say don't worry about it.|`|c07v7O80aa	It's not that they don't "know their rights." I think it's a faint hope that maybe they won't actually look or won't find something. But I've seen any number of experienced crooks consent to a search when they had a trunk full of dope. A blind man couldn't miss it. I suppose some figure if they consent to the search, it will help their claim that they didn't know it was there, but that doesn't often work. I suspect it's mostly that they have two possible responses when asked. Saying yes is one that doesn't take much thought and comes easily to those who don't have anything. Saying no requires at least an internal frantic calculation of risks and consequences, and they take the easy one. That;s why the first lesson in profiling is that crooks, no matter how intelligent, are stupid and lazy.

It would be a judgment that a judge would enter in a ruling on the basis of the Summons and Complaint with Affidavit. If you do not answer the Summons and Complaint with Affidavit within your states required time frame the attorney that filed the documents can obtain a default judgment usually without a formal court hearing that becomes enforceable. The Summons should tell you the time you have to respond to it.    The issue of the dates is a point that could be argued but arguing them would expensive and normally pointless as they would only serve you again with corrected dates. Over the years I have run into many papers that we have been sent to serve with dates that were not right.  Alot of the time the notary is a employee in the attorneys office and what happens is that the filing process and document delivery to the process server or sheriff's office happens quicker than expected.        The process server only needs for his Affidavit of Service to be correct and for it to reflect the correct date of service.    http://www.tjconnerassociates.com
qpcYYWlIaa	Aside from the media publicity as suggested by another responder; the Government Immigration Service is divided into Districts; though the Federal Laws remain the same; degree of enforcement varies. Just because one trial attorney at the INS says they will not place your husband into deportation proceedings does not mean the other  district will not.     Once in Immigration court, given the circumstances, you should have a chance. You need to watch out how the government works; they can be very strict. Also, the trail attorney has bosses too. Your attorney might want to talk to the District Director requesting your husband be placed in removal proceedings. If he already has, just seek out another District Director.    In the future, anything to do with the government deadlines, plan way ahead. The immigration proceeding will not be a walk in the park either. As an illustration, I know of a case under the than applicable immigration law where this alien could have stayed and be granted his permanent residency. In his case he required 7 years of presence in the country. He was short one day; before he got into trouble. His lawyers even argued leap year which fell within the time frame of 7 years. Did not work. He lost because he was one day short of the seven years. Your situation is different though.|`|T8nap2Pnaa	well, you can try running your own publicity campaign, and you should at least contact your congressman and senators, but in the end, USCIS did exactly what they should have done under (a strict interpretation) the law and regulations, and in reality, you didn't. fair or not isn't part of this analysis. they're usually more likely to respond to a congressman or senator, but that's not always so. If it's dangerous back home for your husband, you could file an asylum application but without any further information, no one can say how likely that would be to work. it would allow him to stay longer but if he doesn't get it, all you've done is postponed the inevitable.     At this rate, if he doesn't leave, he'll be subject to deportation, and as your attorneys have noted, he could try to use the fact that it would be dangerous for him to return to avoid deportation, but even that isn't a given. and, as noted, maybe they won't bother to deport him. he's certainly not the only illegal in Texas these days.    But, at this point, you appear to have gotten legal advice, tried every avenue of approach open to you, and lost. I don't think you'll get better advice here free on Yahoo. since you've filed your immigrant petition for him, have it sent back home or to Mexico, if he can stay there for a while for an interview. if they aren't going to deport him, he could stay here until it's been processed, sent to the National Visa Center and is ready for interview. however, he'd be ineligible as an overstay and would need a waiver, and that would keep him there up to six months while they process the waiver. So, if all else fails, he'd probably be better off leaving before he has been here out of status for more than 6 months. are your attorneys suggesting anything different?    by the way, you can't get divorced, and file again and get anything positive that way. he would still be out of status on the K-1 and would not be able to adjust status on a new petition from you, or anyone else, without leaving the US.|`|jAg4AdbTaa	The members (including 2 immigration lawyers) in the following forum may possibly be able to give you some good free advice.

PWvS7vqPaa	Yes, that is assault.  Bouncers have no more authority or right to assault or hurt you than the average person.  The only difference is that if an individual assaults you, you can only sue him/her, but if the bouncer did it in the employment of the club, then you may be able to sue the club as well since they are responsible for what their employees do.    If you were out of line in any way or were causing a disturbance, then yes, they had a right to throw you out, but unless you were becoming belligerent and they were forced to use physical force to control you, then they illegally assaulted you.    You probably would not even need a camera if you have enough witnesses who can testify on your behalf as to what happened, but camera footage never hurts.|`|ucYwexwJaa	LOL!!!!

He's spending money JUST to spend it and for no other reason.|`|8704d6bf53d5099969addcfa560ad9eaaa	Obama alone cost more than any other president in history, the added security for Obama is double than any other president, he got a brand new bullet/bomb proof limo that for security reasons the cost will not be known until Obama is out of Office some people speculate that it is in the 100 million dollar range.  I never did like Obama just because of his plans for America not because of his skin Obama bots, if Colin Powell ran I would have voted for him and he has more black in his little finger than Obama.  Obama is running this country in to the ground with every approval he makes and he does not even know what the consequences will be if any on everything is signing, it seems to me Obama will sign a used piece of toilet paper if it is placed in front of him just because it makes him look like he is doing something, even if he does not know what it is he's doing.|`|0s190C7Zaa	yeah hillary clinton perhaps.|`|AA11598520	Challenge Obama?!

G57RZLsnaa	wow theres enough pessimists on YA... how could Obama be impeached if he hasnt done anything physically (or apparently morally) detremintal to the nation? it hasnt even been a month, give the guy a chance.     What he can do to move the country forward is to make this nation into the land of opportunity as it should be. Revoke Prop 8 and all laws like it so our homosexual neighbors can love their partners as we love ours. Reform the schooling system in our country's ghettos and inner cities. These schools are essentially **** holes and are the basis for the high crime rates in their areas. Get our troops out of Iraq because there is no way a nation without an air force or a navy can conquer us and theres no reason to send our children into an unjust war. This will also help with our image...|`|zil98G3Yaa	Contact him via e-mail, and tell him.  You are Acorn's President, not ours.  .........................................

Star-Kist Tuna's headquarters are in San Francisco ,  Pelosi's home district.                 Star-Kist is owned by Del Monte Foods and is a major  contributor to Pelosi.                 Star-Kist is the major employer in American Samoa employing  75% of the Samoan work force.                 Paul Pelosi, Nancy 's husband, owns $17 million dollars  of Star-Kist stock.                  In January, 2007 when the minimum wage was increased from$5.15 to $7.25, Pelosi had American Samoa exempted from the  increase so Del Monte would not have to pay the higher wage.  This would make Del Monte products less expensive than their  competition's.                 Last week when the huge bailout bill was  passed, Pelosi  added an earmark to the final bill  adding $33 million  dollars for an 'economic development credit in  American  Samoa '.                 Pelosi has called the Bush  Administration  "CORRUPT" ? ?|`|b22d8ccedb447bfcc30483c3590f81f3aa	Impeach him|`|cbDfpfYKaa	Don't waste any energy on idiots like Limbaugh.|`|GkqTIGVqaa	Resign.|`|lvBUl3Zdaa	Go for it. )|`|AA10928202	Resign before the impeachment.|`|b931753da53fa7c2b1a6ae8598d475b8aa	Quickly go to the Oval office and resign|`|2vUOqAikaa	Pray, listen, be firm, think everything through, "stay" confident, be careful & remember that you have the support of most of U.S. behind you.|`|B4kp487Caa	he should step in front of a speeding bus.|`|haXKbqwRaa	Does it matter? It's not like he's about to read this.|`|AA10470367	A couple thoughts.  First, be careful that you don't fall into the trap of viewing anyone with differing opinions as to be unpatriotic. It appears we are currently in a time where many folks supporting Obama ( which is fine) are quick to shout down anyone who ask to be heard favoring a different line of reason. One of the worst things for any friendship, business, president, etc is to be surrounded by Yes people. There are good ideas available from a variety of sources. The current debate in regards to the stimulus bill is a good case in point. We all know this country needs help and although its a shame we are at a time where we need to provide massive amounts of dollars to help, there are many republicans, democrats, and economist ( currently well over 300 independents) who are sending up alarms that the bill is to massive and proposes to spend huge amounts on programs that won't create new jobs - which is one primary key to the entire bill. My point is I pray Obama has the wisdom and courage to listen to the people in the know and demand a bill that actually has a chance to accomplish its intent. If he doesn't, we all are going to be in for a long, hard time.

Maybe you should take a few days to read it and you'll actually know where the money is going.  Here's a hint, you won't see any of it!|`|E72VO2iSaa	New boss just like the old boss.  The best thing for them to do is nothing.  If the government would not give our country away to the international corporations, we could come out of this very strong economically.  Americans have started to be prudent in their spending.  The wheelers and dealers want an avalanche of wasteful spending.  Which is great in the short run.  Creates a lot of jobs temporally.  Our country will prosper much better in the long run if we become a nation of wise shoppers rather than the buy and throw away habits of the past.  We can have stability, jobs that lasts rather than come and go.     Oh my, I didn't say anything about party politics.  I can guess that you see it as a spectator sport.  Raw raw team Republican.  We need to come off that silliness.  Our government resources are being looted  and our leaders are welcoming the looters with open arms.  Forget team labels and start voting for people with some sense.|`|3yXhtBSxaa	They're hypocrites.    And they were jealous that Republicans were doing it and they had no control over it.

And if you feel like we're throwing money around it's a fact that it's being done because Bush threw money around Iraq that put us in a semi-depression so now Barack is throwing money around OUR country hoping to get us out of it.

"I have nothing against white male construction workers," Reich said. "I'm just saying there are a lot of other people who have needs as well.     "There are ways in which the money can be, criteria can be set so the money does go to others, the long term unemployed, minorities, women," he said.     Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., appeared to agree, suggesting federal money be directed to specific groups of people.     The federal government, he said, must "remove the discretion" about where the funds go, or what projects would be involved, even to the point of eliminating any input from governors or state legislatures.    Reich agreed: "Governors ought to be, should be given a choice of signing on the bottom line or not."     Then Rangel noted the "middle class" would be unlikely to create any opposition to funds directed to minorities.     "One thing that you can depend on, you don't have to be worried about what the middle class is going to do. Things are so bad, they have to put food on their tables, get clothes for their kids, get them in school," he said.|`|saQHPbBHaa	With the amount of work our infrastructure needs, it sure could.|`|SGwkPy62aa	There will be no jobs, Obama has ordered us to volunteer.|`|bG3drjw3aa	They will not help if they are government funded projects because that would merely pup more money into the economy and inflate it.|`|58607c6ba5c8f548e69203c94d723527aa	Just ask Japan.

The massive amounts of construction will be periodic and will generally coincide with housing construction, so there will be massive periodic layoffs throughout the construction industry.    The bottom line is that you and I have to pay for them, so how sustainable is that?

EhvulfKraa	A wise Mr Jason.  The problem started when we where removed from hard currency starting with gold, then silver. The "fed" is a private organization and has no allegiance to anyone but themselves. The fact that they will print 2 plus trillion will assure double to triple digit inflation, and you can bank on that. Walk into an action and hand each person a thousand dollars; the bidding will go higher..and that in a nut shell is how inflation works. As is the case of all countries that lost their freedom to socialism, the "insiders" as I call them create the mess and naturally, they always have the solution which is more government. Watch Obama pull off the heist, it is happening now.|`|u93eagkqaa	Sounds like you got a hold of a Ron Paul rant. The Federal reserve has no control over banks whether they lend or not. Until the banks get all of the bad debt off their books they will not lend.    The Economic problems are far more complex than just blaming inflation and the reserve.     I wouldn't listen to that Ron Paul he doesn't know anything not to mention he's a gyneocologist not a economist.|`|AA10719402	I've heard this quite a bit......    I was just curious.. Can you explain how they have forced us into this recession?????|`|yozsPWPZaa	we have no leaders,only parasites that are sucking on our tax $$$$.|`|J6OIYcIiaa	I feel both republicans and dems are wrong on economic problems.  I think we should let the economy weed out the weak.  I say do nothing, and let economic nature take its course.  No bailouts for car companies who didnt create cars consumers wanted to buy, no bailout for banks who gave bad loans, nothing.  Then again, im not an economic expert.  Just my little opinion.

This plan is a joke.|`|DiDCG9UBaa	Everything George Bush ever did? Just guessing.|`|AA10818613	I'm glad to see that you agree the bill is bipartisan. There's tax cuts for the middle class and for small businesses just like the GOP and the Dems wanted.  And, the GOP still wouldn't vote for it.  Seriously, what do they stand for except the further demise of this country and economy by pursuing the same policies that got us into this mess in the first place.  The last 8 years have been the most partisan extreme right wing GOP economic and social policies I've ever seen.  And, the GOP won't quit.  They keep touting the same partisan rants and policies even though the American people voted them out by huge numbers.    Those of you who think there is pork in it.  Stand up and prove it.  Where is it in the bill?  I've read the entire bill and didn't see any pork.  Prove it.|`|SGwkPy62aa	I have never seen anything more stupid than Obama stimulus.  You would think that with all the money spent on his education, he would know the difference between stimulus and spending.  I guess it  boils down to his belief that those that voted for him are too stupid to know the difference.|`|K8Ca1sU3aa	The Iraq War was bi-partisan. This spending bill is not. It's LOADED with pork!!!    EDIT:    Loving the thumbs down. The TRUTH hurts, doesn't it?|`|fDuCamMraa	Right! And I've never seen a more docile pet than a Great White Shark.    You've got serious problems kid. The only thing bi-partisan was the votes against it!|`|cIHBpcREaa	Good one - not one republicans voted for in the House.  Why, because it's all pork.    I guest bi-partisan means the republicans will be heard but their ideas won't be included.    EDIT.  Maybe bi-partisan means "we have a plan and you just need to approve it".|`|19L99wvCaa	Nope, and the Republicans have shot themselves in the foot. Again.|`|B1XT60WEaa	I do not think it will go anywhere until it is changed substantially. They all know it will not work as presented. They now know their future rides on it, if it fails to work they will be looking for jobs just like us.|`|NP6ES2GPaa	Yeah ... not to be brash, but maybe the Night of the Long Knives?|`|AA10015679	The man is tryihng to heal the nation and the RNC continuing to force us down the drain....|`|FrfdKKGWaa	The only bipartisan part is that 11 Democrats voted with Republicans AGAINST the Obama Stimulus bill.

The whole election was about Obama being the first black president.    Dr. King's wish was for the most qualified person black, white, or whatever to be able to get any job.    The democrats say they want equal opportunity, the question is when will they see past race to achieve their stated goal.    Very few Republicans even mentioned Obama's race during the campaign.  Only that he didn't have the experience for the job.|`|K0HMWItqaa	LMFAO!|`|9x4fssPuaa	Because MLK was a Republican himself. MLK's thing was to be fair and equal and he actually was in support of what the country was founded on. His dream was for us to NOT vote upon race, yes even black. By doing that MLK himself would call that racism.      Dr. Alveda King, MLK's niece even mentioned on a radio show that her uncle's dream is not fulfilled by electing Obama.

6B3ojD2Laa	I see Sweden as a place where people really tried to have an open hearted and fair approach to the world, so they've let many people in who were on the edge of survival and the government takes a real soft approach on crime and tries to be so idealistic and refuse to accept that some people (not only immigrants!) are just pieces of shiit that don't deserve to be treated with so much respect.  Good luck with that idealism.  We have it in some places here in USA, and in other places we have the opposite extreme.  Europeans have been saying for years that "there's no racism in Europe." But as your ethnic populations balloon in size, I hope you can find a balance without going to the opposite extreme and turn Nazi on us. It's not easy, but try to push for tougher laws on crime without being overly discriminatory or racist with it.|`|a66nvk0taa	The Swedes are to soft on Immigrants. Follow us Danes what we have done. Changes laws to make it harder for them to come and live here. If you want to live here they got to speak Danish and follow Danish customs etc. If you don't like it they know where the door is.|`|6389fc55051a8e265f2d4105be69a514aa	I was shocked to discover that there are areas in the city of Stockholm where the police will not go unless it is in a large force.  The civil authorities literally have no control over these areas.    This is similar to other nations in Western Europe where certain immigrants do not want to integrate themselves into society.
19L99wvCaa	Unfortunately, no. We're stuck with them.|`|C0b6q7hiaa	No.  It would be easier to get additional S.C. Justices appointed, that just requires a change in the law, and has been done many times, though not in past 100 years.  (FDR tried, and failed)    Having Mandatory Retirement ages, would require COnstitutional Amendment.  Further, only Scalia is close to 70, there are more liberal and moderate S.C. justices who are at a normal retirement age, so there would be little point, assuming your query was serious.|`|08c47ade809f8810ef2b21fa9304d450aa	You forgot about Roberts and Alito.  The only four sane people on the SCOTUS.  No you can't, and it's typical power grabbing by the left, who can't use the power of good logic to convince others.|`|Hw8rr1TCaa	Unfortunately not.

But he could not even beat Ben Cardin in the Maryland state elections and I believe he was too close to George W. Bush's failed administration.

"They really hit the ground running," said Steve Beshear, interviewed by CNN. "They're working very hard to get all the equipment and supplies here that we need."      Crews have been working to restore power and water service to hundreds of thousands of people. Beshear said that while he realizes "nothing moves fast enough," he said the federal assistance "has been a great help to us so far."    Beshear, a Democrat, explained that when the first wave of bad weather came through on Tuesday and Wednesday morning, officials realized that they needed additional help.    "I called the White House directly at that time. I had my other folks talking to FEMA, but I went straight to the top because we needed fast help," he said.    He said he spoke to the director of intergovernment relations and said she walked Kentucky's paperwork through. He said President Obama called him and told him he was announcing an emergency declaration for the state.    "I can't tell you how appreciative we were," the governor said. "He not only expressed his concern, but he obviously had the Kentuckians in his thoughts and prayers, and he communicated that to us."|`|lDbNf3h9aa	Uh, Obama's mother is white, so I don't think so.

The only difference New Orleans was told days prior what was going to happen but they didn't leave. But somehow it all got turned around and it was the Presidents fault that they would not evacuate. Grayson County was not told to evacuate and did not know it was going to be that bad. Plus they are just a bunch of white people so no one cares!|`|zj91sSsuaa	I don't see how it's his problem anymore than New Orleans was Bush's.     But yeah, I get it.

5f5749d37610dbd9abaec08095263c26aa	In addition to the severity of the injuries caused by the domestic violence, a judge might look at the offender's criminal past.      Appearing before the same judge for a 2nd offense for the same crime is probably not going to impress the judge.  If this person does not have a lawyer yet, they need one now!    The judge is likely to try to impress the offender with the severity of domestic violence this time ... he is not likely to catch any breaks if he is found guilty.  The judge might go for the maximum sentence allowed by law.|`|RRFbDou9aa	Yes, but most of the sentencing is determined by the actual level of crime it is.  In my state throwing something at someone without hurting them (but scaring them) is the same crime as punching them in the eye.  However, if you broke a bone you're looking at a felony and that's a whole different set of problems.

You pay your taxes, you're entitled to the protection that society can give you. He's already engaging in a criminal act, so nip it in the bud before it has the opportunity to escalate.

They will want to listen to it.|`|ARAYm7BLaa	yes, ring up your phone provider and get "withheld "numbers barred...and go to the police, perhaps ring victim support and get some counselling as this is nasty|`|7b71287270d8cb608d239de158f4a044aa	Yes it's harassment.

I don't know which side of the pond you're at. The British police would certainly help and would probably press charges.|`|fxp8qIsIaa	Its more than sexual harassment. its obscene phone calls and stalking. get the police in fast and inform your telephone provider so they can monitor the calls.

This might be some scared little wierdo who will never do more than call, or it might be someone building up to something worse.

It might seem a little alarmist, but its better to be certain.|`|AA11510511	This is definitely sexual harassment.  First of all, make sure you keep any voicemail or any texts that is sent to you from this vile person.    You MUST report it to the police, for your own safety.  When you have done this, make sur you get a Crime Reference Number from the police.    Then contact your network provider, explain to them the situation.  Explain to them that you need your number changed for your own safety.  It is them that will also require the Crime Reference number to, before they will consider changing your number.    I know it could be a big hassle for you to change your number, for the work involved of getting your friends'  numbers and them getting your new one.    BUT YOUR SAFETY COMES FIRST!!!!!

77lIzq4Taa	I think that such a pronouncement should wait until at least the end of a presidents term of office. I know there is a lot of excitement about the new Administration, but there are things such as unintended consequences to any Law or Executive Order. I would like to see how things such as the economy do over the next few years. If President Obama leads the country through the problems and dangers of the next 4 years and the country is better for it, I will agree with him being CONSIDERED as one of the greatest. I say this as a Conservative who does not think that this will be the case.  I think when compaired in 4 years to Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, Reagan he will be seen to be lacking in policy and stature.

Its an exciting time for Americans, whether or not you agree with President Barack Obamas plans. My hope is that our new president will instill some confidence in people, not necessarily set out to fix everybody and everything.     There are some bogus government strategies floating around to stimulate the economy and "save us from ourselves." Just because theyre all everyone talks about doesnt make them true! Here are a few of the big issues:     Tax Breaks  These arent bad, and I would never turn them down. But to think that tax breaks single-handedly stimulate the economy is laughable. Remember last fall? Those stimulus checks didnt fix the problem, so what makes us think its going to fix everything this time? Did you know it was your money to start with? Theyre just giving it back to you and making you feel good about it. If youre looking for $1,000 to change your life this year, you obviously dont have a life to start with!    It may help you today or this month, but $1,000 will do very little for you in the long run. To win with money, you've got to think long term.    Patriotic Duty  The government wants you to spend, spend, spendand many Americans are taking this advice while still in debt! No matter what the talking heads say, it is not your patriotic duty to spend money you dont have. Your duty is to take care of yourself and your household with the money you earn from an honest days work.    If you have your full emergency fund and are in a position to buy something, now is the perfect time! You can get some fabulous deals, but dont let the deals entice you if you havent planned ahead and dont have the cash!    National Deficit  The dog is still chasing its tail.     Debt started the problem, so what is the current plan to fix the problem? More debt!  What really drives the economy? Is it D.C.'s programs or small-business people scattered throughout the country? This down economic time will begin to heal itself. Do we have to go $1 trillion in debt to do that? No way!    The good news is that our future as an economy isnt coming out of Washington. Our future prosperity is coming out of the hopes, dreams and individual freedoms of the American people. When left alone, we have a tendency to prosper.     The healing of the economy will begin and end with you. Yes, you, the person you see in the mirror! You have to make your decision as to whether or not youre going to take part in the recession.    As for our new president, if youre not a fan, pray for him. Hes your president. If you are a fan, pray for him. Hes your president, not your savior. Your hope will be crushed if you wait for him and his administrationor anyone elseto fix your life and give you money.      good luck|`|todJGCP8aa	I'm with Reality...he's off to a great start|`|B1XT60WEaa	No none at all.

i7oHTo9haa	It is either 1) the police went wild as the Brits occasionally do and took it upon themselves to further their political agenda as ordinary citizens separate from the British gov't  or    2) there is an international court somewhere that wants the traveler for charges,has it in their books that any foreign national can be brought to charges,  and the Brit gov't is a member of that court and is using the authority of that court    British gov't is with us on the war on terror along with the other civilized gov'ts. and I'd be surprised and sad if this had backing from them. During the operation I did hear a call from somewhere in Britain for charges but with that momentum fueled by the bloody palestinian propaganda pictures I don't know how much resistance it got.  It was galloway and kaufman over there in the parliament    Blair was our  1 ally on war on terror in Britain and the people there tried to impeach him thru their parliament, actually did bring him to court to no avail to them.     I, and a few others, think the average Brit has gone mad. I think the ordinary citizen doesn't realize the terror threat even after the London train bombing and or more fueled by emotion than actual logic and facts. I think that the average  Euro is similar in that they have a large Muslim population that influences their decisions, and has parted somewhat from the rest of civilized western world  to that of a .terrorist supporter.    I went on a cruise a while back long before this Gaza thing, and met up with some Brits on the ship, you should have heard the venom from their mouths regarding the war on terror. They insist they know what is right and vocally express it.    They have handed their own country over to Muslim immigrants along with the rest of Europe. London is now known as Londonistan and in France muslim youths shouted to riot police "get out of my occupied France."  It would take some wake up call for them to realize the err of their ways and their mindset and snap out of it.   So I believe their immigrants are influencing their opinions and they are parting from western civilized ideals and leaning more towards the arab opinion.    Tell your friend to come to the Americas.  We are all overwhelmingly Israel supporters here and there is protection. During the operation you should have seen the Canadian support, the American support, the Mexican support, the South American support, it is overwhelmingly for Israel. Even the Venezuelan citizens are for Israel it is just their leader that oppresses them and allies with Iran and is trying to take over the whole population and influence their mindset.     In these countries, the muslims have not had that much of an influence they started invading Europe first and the "true west" has resisted them. In America, we're ready to lynch any Muslim terrorists when we see them we do not have a Euro mindset at all, not even close. America is vast country they would have difficulty doing that here.    Anyways, the Brits didn't recognize Hitler as a threat, ignored Churchill labeling him a fool and went with Chamberlain labeling him a hero when he made the land for peace deal with Hitler.  Time told the true story and reversed itself, that Churchill was the actual hero, and Chamberlain the fool.  They didn't recognize the issues then, and they're not recognizing the Islamofascist threat today.  Where Hitler started at center of Germany by propaganda campaign and then expanded it outward by force, the Musim tactic has been propaganda outward first by immigrants influencing mindset and propaganda in the media, then exploding that immigrant population for takeover as they are already planted within those societies.  They are quite good at this propaganda campaign. If the Brits only knew what these Islamofascists had in store for them they would have hailed your friend a hero instead of a criminal, he'd be a Churchill not a Chamberlain.  Tell him, despite the madness of the Brits, that there are civilized people in the "true West" that believe what he's doing is right, are fighting the same terrorist issue, and it is a just cause and under very difficult circumstances. Just tell him to hang in there.  If the Brits only knew. :(    Hamas In Their Own Voices  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i08L09V0_...

Have the Brits gone mad ?  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kly7zChvy...    PS. America and Britain have had a long sisterly relationship. I am ready to drop my support of Britain and  I've been watching Brown very closely and this mad British mindset.  If the Brits think they can continue this path they will go alone.  If they think America will chose Britain over Israel they are sadly mistaken.  If they were smart, they'd get with it, and not force us to choose.|`|fFpZEluIaa	Israel reminds me of someone who was constantly raped as a child, so they grew up to be a paedophile. What Israel needs to realise, is that there is no excuse for being a paedophile, all paedophiles should be executed, no matter how bad their childhood was. If you were raped as a child then you should know how it feels, and you should do everything in your power to make sure it never happens to anyone else. It doesn't mean you have the right to grow up to be just as messed up as the guy who molested you.|`|M1oVSlZdaa	Because the world is anti-semitic.    They will do anything to make Israel and Jews look bad, while at the same time praising the "Palestinians".    It's unfortunate, but the dire truth. And it only proves us Jews need a homeland!    BARUCH HABA!    BTW-RJ, I'm a 15 year old Orthodox Jew- I plan on making Aliyah when after college! I can't wait!|`|8cWXhZGjaa	Because the English are nothing but power hungry imperialists that just sit around and drink tea and eat krumpits all day. They act like they are in charge of everything and don't even know what really goes on in the Middle East. They just like to do anything that can get their hand on power and act like they are in charge of everything when they really aren't.|`|af7kH7U9aa	perhaps old laws ! my english is not very good sorry !|`|AA11622716	His fear does not mean he has correctly analyzed British law.  If he lands in Britain and the authorities are aware of a warrant issued by another country, then they will hold him for extradition but his fear of being prosecuted in England for crimes committed elsewhere is unfounded.|`|AA10811674	They do if it was something he did against a British citizen.|`|AA11598520	I've never heard of such a thing! I suppose the English may do this and so it would be legal in their country, but I just can't imagine they'd do such a thing. Israel has a right to defend itself and regardless, how can they hold a citizen of that country responsible for a decision made by the government?|`|jJxUCkkFaa	maybe this person did something when Israel was part of the British mandate of Palestine
9tQSBMAQaa	While is true that some cops are not that intelligent, and don't have much compassion, I wouldn't call them retarded.  This cop seems to be very "by the book", which was bad for you.  The best police sincerely believe they are there to serve the public.    In defense of the police, most join the force because they do believe they can make a difference.  Some are just airheads.|`|t3A9qpQIaa	Not retarded.  Just motivated to find victims, er, lawbreakers.  Not all are that way but it seems like a lot are.|`|UoGFo3Dhaa	It is not Police that are retarded.  Out here in the boonies our police are very reasonable and intelligent.  My neighbors on both side are Deputies.  I just hollered out the window and asked one of them your question.    He says living in the city makes everybody retarded after awhile.  Look at those Wall Street folks.  They have totally lost their minds.|`|u6ALw1gAaa	I think the stupid one is the one that refuses to take care of his obligation and makes it worse on himself in the process.|`|eKuvx6f8aa	yes,I agree...|`|Mxr6AIkiaa	Let's look at who was acting stupid that night. Did the cop go somewhere without enough money to go home? No, you and your friend did. Or did you go down with enough money and spend it? No matter, really, it was your doing.    So, having stupidly gotten yourselves into this mess, what should you have done? Probably you should have called your parents. But of course you didn't want them to find out, so you compounded the stupidity of the situation.    Then, having gotten the citation you choose to ignore it. If you had responded in a timely and appropriate way, there was a chance (I said "was" and "a chance") that you could have convinced a judge to adopt your view. But you blew that.|`|3KXBzSzfaa	some try 60% of them|`|xvtev56jaa	yes cops can be retarded.    i mean, some are nice and loyal to their title  but most take their job for granted and abuse their powers.|`|4524a51ebceabc8fa63fb65f4e71f029aa	Yes i do, some are pompous asses.     Then again there are some nice ones.|`|mqXyDTwwaa	You were in Manhattan in the middle of the night with no money and no way to get home. Then you just decided not to pay a ticket, because you think that if you don't believe you deserve it, you don't have to pay it. Ummmm, no. I don't think it's the cop that's retarded.|`|OVUkamlpaa	If stupidity was painful, you would be begging for morphine right now.    You are just another punk kid who thinks the world owes him. Get a job, and get your own money for train fare, you moron.|`|c6e4f1055e2cd01c39d43355e5af4d01aa	Yes! They are not just retarded they are criminals! He wrote you a ticket to make money for the city and state that is their real job! Protect and serve my @$$ more like harass and extort!|`|367926de3fa96492022d3fae80bbab42aa	You broke the law and was cited. Because you didn't feel like your obligated to follow the rules that everyone else has to you didn't take care of your responsibility to either fight the ticket or pay it and now your in trouble.     So no, I don't agree.|`|GmW5mUrpaa	Brace yourself son, it has only just begun!  This will resemble a cake walk in the days to come.   They have always been dumb but they have gotten bolder in these days. I hope their day is coming.|`|H2yac1kUaa	oh my goodness that stinks on ice!!!!!    i feel soo badd!!!    i sure do hope everything goes well, though!      (stupid cops)|`|dLOSy9zgaa	no. i think the reasoning for your ticket is stupid but i think that the officer was just doing his/her job.  she has no idea weather you are lying or not.|`|fe8aa5495caab3873690c07d37e65268aa	I don't think he was retarded, I do think that it has probably happened before and he was tired and you were the "last straw" type of thing.  I am sure that others have done it and that is why he didn't believe you.  I believe you.  You should get the name of the lady at the front desk, if she can remember,  and your friend to be a witness for you for when you go to court.      I would not recommend you ignoring a bill.  Hopefully there won't be, but next time you should call and get a court date instead to fight something you believe is worth fighting for.    God Bless.|`|zYTlRlJSaa	No, he was just doing his job. Plenty of teenagers do try **** like that, and make up bullshit excuses. He had no way to know you were the /one/ kid who was telling the truth. Try to look at it from his point of view. If they treated every problem like, "Oh, he seems like a nice kid, he's probably telling the truth," a lot of actually guilty people would get away with a lot.    Even if you feel you don't deserve a ticket, that gives you no right to not pay it. Again, what if they accepted that for everything? "Oh, no, I don't have to pay this ticket. Yes, I was speeding in a school zone, but I just wanted to get home, and those kids should know to look both ways anyway."|`|jSH47SN7aa	dude that sounds like a f@ $ed up story  but i agree some cops are retarded   i went to a different school and i got out early so i was driving to my friends house and i got stopped out of the blue and hes telling me i'm up under the age and i'm skipping school so he gives me a ticket and after i drove off i tossed it out the window and and later i got a court date which is in feb also   so i'm stuck but most cops are stupid lol|`|65I0e3wYaa	Your 17, any teen they will take advantage of situation. They are just trying exert their power over others to suppress their homoerotic thoughts.|`|AA10534526	Yes I agree.    Ten years ago my friend was in a really bad accident when a truck ran over the top of a little car and my friend was caught in between, so when the cops came over they just dropped him off at a restaurant while he was in shock. It took a waitress to call 911.|`|DK93MIrJaa	Why is it the cops fault you didn't have any money? How about a little responsibility on your part. If you don't have money, STAY HOME.    How do you expect the cop to catch murderers and robbers when he is expected to do charity work for you?
5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	The 401k is based in the stock market, so no one did anything evil, the market took a downturn.  That's the long and short of it.  If you didn't understand your money would be in the market, you should have read the fine print more carefully.  Any program based on market increases isn't insured or guaranteed.    My daughter lost 20% of her IRA.  Shes young enough to wait and hope it comes back.  This is only one of the reasons investing in the market with Social Security privatization was such a bad idea. It can't be guaranteed to increase.|`|AA11598520	Geeze, is it?! I don't even look at that stuff. All the helpful economists say leave it where it is so that's what I do. I think I might be the cause of this thing. It started to tank not long after I maxed out my contributions.|`|UoGFo3Dhaa	I never had a 401k.    I have been saving for my son's college for 16 years.  I had $6,000 dollars saved.    Edward Jones turned it in to only $4,312 dollars in a few months.    If I ever catch a tie wearing bastard around here.  I have a shotgun...    I HATE SUITS...  Bunch of worthless bastards.  You pukes ripped my son off.

A criminal justice degree can help but it's not required.  The thing that looks great on a resume for LE is languages.  If you're bi-lingual or better you have a big edge on the competition    Find out when the entrance exams are for agencies in your area and start testing.  Remember: wear a suit to everything.|`|367926de3fa96492022d3fae80bbab42aa	I wouldn't bother with studying to much. Most entry level examinations are fairly basic. They measure your ability to read, write and remember facts and/or evidence. I would just apply and take the test. If you fail, at least you'll have an idea of what to expect but if you've been going to school you should be fine.
01669e8c4403fe7fd458f8bdcb56e56aaa	I think you are confused.  The House voted, not the senate.  The GOP members are playing politics.  They couldn't care less about moving this country forward.|`|zEVpA4WCaa	THEY VOTED AGAINST IT BECAUSE IT'S A STUPID IDEA AND IT WONT WORK .AND IT'S FULL OF PORK PROJECTS THAT ARE MEANT TO BE PAY BACK  TO THERE FRIENDS FOR THERE SUPPORT. 819 BILLION AND THAT'S JUST FOR STARTERS WHEN THIS FAILS THEY WILL BE BACK FOR MORE .ANY IDEA WHO'S REALLY PAYING FOR THIS? HEADS UP IF YOU HAVE A JOB YOUR GOING TO PAY AND SO WILL YOUR KIDS AND THERE KIDS AND MOST LIKELY THERE KIDS.   SOME CHANGE!|`|A5RunUIkaa	They voted against it because it sucks. Right idea (we need a stimulus plan), but way too much wasteful spending. This is not a well put together bill. Expected more.|`|GJKWgx0Paa	isn't this the exact same reason why the Democratic Senators refused to rein in FNMA and HUD when President Bush warned of trouble ahead?|`|u93eagkqaa	They are pissed and want something in return for their vote. The only thing they are concerned about is their base. If those republicans senators don't get out there and get some pork for their states then they wont get re-elected anyway.    Keep in mind that's all senators do is get pork for their state if they don't they are useless.|`|nmbbG0vdaa	then how do you explain the 11 dems that did not vote for the stimulus package.  Thats right  11 dems voted against the bill......could it be because the stimulus package is a pork laden piece of crap that most economists are saying will not help us?|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	The Senate hasn't voted yet only the far more contentious House.  In the Senate, with a tweak or two it may very well pass.  They are no where near as partisan as the house.  And the GOP governors are also pulling for this.  I don't seriously think that the GOP wants the Obama to fail.  They don't want to work so hard at getting us out or they would have fielded better candidates than McCain and Palin.  They did have better options, but messy cleanups is not where they are at.  If the economy is on the upswing their chant will be 'We would have gotten you out sooner", without a shred of evidence.|`|e9z5oVKPaa	They didn't vote for it because it is not a stimulus plan. Why don't you read it and come back.|`|qsDCeiNNaa	brakc osama is a crack head and the republicans dont truth they know|`|ctcCPMdCaa	No, they just don't want to take any responsibility when it fails.    Note that I said "when", not "if".|`|293f42f2b7be2f65dd5e6bdaecbded4caa	unconformed?I'm guessing that you meant to say unconfirmed.At any rate I  believe that Republicans are not going along with the President on this because even he wildly fluctuates the number of jobs the "stimulus package "will create.He has also said that this spending package will not translate into any immediate success.  What it will do is create a need for a tax hike to be passed on to the American public.This bill will give a temporary income tax reduction of at the most $1000 to a married couple.The reduction will come in approximately $20 increments in your weekly paycheck.I'm not sure just how that $20 will keep you from losing your home or affording a new car when those tax cuts will be temporary and not take place until the second half of 2009.  Obama's plan puts more money into state governments and big businesses for more pork spending than ever in the history of our country.No Democrat liked the Bush administration's bailout of the banking and auto industries(President Obama voted in favor of that bailout,also),but they voted for it..Now the Democrats want to have their own bailout that our grandchildren will pay for.We seem to forget that the Democrats have controlled Congress for a few years and equally share the blame for the state of the country.  Whether or not the economy rebounds,and it will,there are no guarantees that the President will be re-elected.The President won 53% of the popular vote and I don't think that anyone would consider that to be a great landslide.|`|2FA9qNHzaa	The Senate has not voted on it.   They are sure to amend it in a major way to prevent as much spending as is in it, like the trails for ATVs. How hypocritic and disrepectful to the planet.   What the House Repblicans did was send a very clear message that the bill was wasteful and expensive. What the Congress does and what Limbaugh says are not related in any form, what so ever.|`|bc1202e9aa15ed85d573b1219c69b9cdaa	His "stimulus" is anything but. It's a pork, make-work project. Additionally, the government can't really do much to stimulate the economy.|`|VWLCwLNMaa	All I know for certain is that our industrial base has been trickled down to China. Now we not only import oil, we import everything.     One man's pork is another man's food.    Bike paths are being called pork. We import oil. Bikes don't use oil. Am I missing something here? Are we too high and mighty for simple solutions?|`|56db1a8e5fe3dfc4d4fbbbff987d0191aa	They did not approve the plan because it will not work.  It is bad for our country.  It does not help the economy.  It does not help small business.  It is full of pork and wasteful spending.  It will make government even larger.  In other words...it is ridiculous that Obama is even trying to get this thing through.  I think he did it so that when it does not pass he can say, well I tried to give you all those wonderful things that you wanted and I got shot down.  So he can still continue looking like this great hero.  So sad.

You should read it before posting this type of cr-p. Palin would have been just as bad if not worse since she is a racist.      If you are going to post stuff like this read the package, every page and you will be shocked. I was. Slam the republicans if you want but do it with the correct info.

"governer" is actually Governor  "Beautiful" is always a good reason to vote for someone.  "Articulate" do you even know what this word means?   "Good mother" Did Bristol have the baby yet?  You also lump "pro black" and "anti american" in the same sentence.    You are a racist plain and simple. I hope you have a daughter who gets prego by a blackman.

There we are in a recession and people want more money and went on strike aided by their ultra-left wing, Soviet sponsored and paid for Unions.    The result was massive loss of businesses throughout this country - why do you think that we are not a major manufacturing country anymore; where do you think our docks went, where did our ship-building go?    To those of you who think it is tough now, well I've some news for you, it is going to get a hell of a lot tougher.    The country did not break down into mass rioting then and it will not happen now.    As to taxing the rich, or is that anyone who earns more than you do?    Under Wilson we had income tax at 95% for top earner, guess what happened?    They all moved away from this country and it was called the 'brain drain'.    You see, you can only tax people so much before they say, "bye-bye".    Now you are left with what?    Well, if you left-wingers and right-wingers have your way then you will find that a lot more people leave this country permanently, so who are you going to tax then?    What about doctors and dentists and teachers and nurses - oh dear, we have to hire in foreigners to replace the people you have taxed out of this country.    Do you know why, I think, we have so many foreigners coming in, it is because we are losing people far faster than Blair or Brown were prepared to admit, go onto the Office of National Statistics and there are no figures after 2002 that make any statistical sense when compared with all of the previous figures.

Our obscenely rich masters are laughing at the other 95% of us.  As well they might, because we let them get away with their crimes.    Mass riots, though - the last time that happened was when the British people defeated the poll tax.  There's a lesson there - what we did once we could do again.  However, the poll tax was a single issue, and at the moment, there are a range of serious problems, but people do not seem to have focused on any one of them in the same way.    On bringing back socialism, yes, with you all the way.  Restore the achievements of the Attlee government, which made this country for the first time in its history a fit place for the majority of its people to live in;  but then go on to complete the work by not only taking back everything the enemy have taken from us, but nationalising the banks and bringing the Tory media into responsible social and public ownership.

eWeVKUENaa	Hey T.Doug,    Depends on which part of Northern Cali you are talking. If you are speaking North of Sacramento. The first thing you should do is find a community college that offers a fire program. Take the FF 1 academy first. With that you will get your State FF 1, EMT-1 and Hazmat FRO.   As soon as you get that, you will be eligible to start testing at various city departments. OR you can apply for Cal Fire or the U.S. Forest Service and normally get hired without any training at all. With them you will be a seasonal firefighter during the summer and laid off for the winter. During the winter months, you can go to school and work on your degree in Fire Science. If you are talking Sacramento and south, the best thing would be to go through paramedic school, and then go through the fire program. This way you can work on an ambulance while going to school getting your needed paramedic experience. The fire service is a very competitive but rewarding career. It would be a good choice!!!!|`|ylj2PTFFaa	Be a paramedic first, then take the test

rW9Vub7maa	maybe not  but he's had shoes thrown at him|`|TJtifnxPaa	No, because he believes in free speech and didn't pay attention to any of that. He was tough enough to accept that many people had opposing views and didn't like him. He even defended the Dixie Chicks when they made controversial remarks about him when they were preforming in Europe, stating they have a right to express their opinions, that's what our troops are fighting for in the first place.|`|EcuCO4LCaa	The difference between Obama and President Bush was that President Bush did what he felt was right no matter how unpopular it made him. Obama wants to be viewed with rock star status. Bush served this country with honor and integrity and someday he will be viewed as one of the greatest Presidents this country has ever had. Most Presidents  are not appreciated until they are long dead. George Washington and Abraham Lincoln were not popular with the majority of the people they presided over while they were alive. Historians and books that told their legacy's are what made them spectacular.|`|xoK87yuGaa	He only did safe radio (Rush, Hannity, ect...). Nothing to fear from those puppets!

I'd kiss Bush's butt before I'd shake Bills hand, at least I know which ones cleaner with all the hoe's Bill Mahur has to buy to sleep with him.|`|gPOoJnwtaa	Bush didn't read news or watch it because he couldn't take the criticism - he had news delivered to him by his staff so that it could  be filtered.      President Obama is acting much more mature than Bush will ever dream of being.  Not only is he aware of what is going on on both sides of the aisle, but he is confronting it head-on with a plan to work with it.     At no time did President Obama get into any type of "pissing match."  He mentioned Rush's name while speaking to a group of law makers in asking them to work together rather than against each other.  President Obama's comments were not made to the public at large or in general, but to a specific group of people who MUST work together for the good of this nation.

Some people apparently expect President Obama to go to Kentucky and suit up as a lineman and work to restore power.  Personally,  I am quite comfortable in having President Obama declare Kentucky a disaster area, thus allowing resources to flow to where they are needed under the direction of people on the ground who have the appropriate expertise . . . you know, like journeyman lineman who know how to do the work to restore power.  I am pretty sure that though the President is a smart man and skilled in many areas, I would guess being a journeyman lineman is not among his skills.  Next thing some wing nut will suggest that President Obama go to Iraq to fly the planes out of the country with the American soldiers leaving there as his part to end the war . . . but some people have demonstrable ignorance.

In order to become a politician you probably have to alter your ideals and values somewhat, not necessarily because you're succumbing to evil, but rather because that is the way politics have always been.     Understand that ever since man had the notion of other men being superior, there have been ruthless kings and pharaohs to preside over them. Today our politicians don't dictate the ways in which we live our lives with an iron fist, but for every politician that gets caught up in a corruption charge there's probably several dozen that don't.      Understand that its a common stereotype to portray politicians as backstabbers and corrupt bureaucrats, but this stereotype is well rooted in a history of individuals from our own government. There's no denying that a great deal of politicians in US history have mishandled and misused the powers that were invested in them for the greater good of the people and the country they swore an oath to protect and serve.|`|7pf2pGBUaa	us republicans can do no wrong  pay no attention to the man behind the curtain|`|Hcg2juS7aa	crooks with Obama, Biden, and Pelosi being the worst!|`|FSsl25SLaa	There was a saying that Democrats would make you feel good and safe before ripping you off, and Republicans would tell you they were going to rip you off, how they were going to rip you off and then castigate you for allowing yourself to be ripped off.

A leftover from more ceremonial times (and yes, Police have NCO's)    The chinstrap (or chincord) is the piece of leather or braid that runs across the visor from buttons located on either side of the cap. In practice, chinstraps are almost never usedin fact, many of them are strictly for decoration and cannot be adjusted. Today, the main function of a chinstrap is to indicate rank. For example, most enlisted men and NCOs have plain leather or vinyl chinstraps, whereas most officers have chinstraps in a metallic materialband or braid. In some countries such as Italy, special loops around the strap indicate specific rank.|`|c07v7O80aa	Because you never NEVER wear anything around your neck. Even ties are break-away or clip on. Besides, it does look a little dorky.|`|9eMB6BZ6aa	it is more uniform and they dont need it on the front but it seems i have been out answerd again|`|ld1vh7nHaa	because if they wore them around their chins they would look like dorks.|`|0b942db656cf91b93e0853fad2dd236eaa	because its not a chinstrap!!!|`|5OhMq3N2aa	They are state troopers because they all got c's in high school.

di43MlSFaa	I'm aware that Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, David Obey from Wisconsin had allot to do with putting this stimulus bill together.   I don't know if there is one single author of the bill per say though.    I will say, I had no idea that there is $600 million in this for new cars for Govt workers. The "perks" that taxpayers pay for has always bothered me, but new cars??? How is that stimulating the economy for the welfare of the whole?     http://online.wsj.com/article/SB12331046...    http://www.ntu.org/main/press.php?PressI...

99dde179de70f1317248d9ffaaf554b0aa	he works for me i need to keep a eye on all my employees|`|LZY9yDIfaa	He's the president.  The fact that he's been in office for less than two weeks, YET so many on the Right are whining about him is just sour grapes.|`|gIcg7Ug2aa	Haven't you heard?  He's our leader, the President of the United States.  Everything he does is important to us.|`|eFXD3Qzcaa	Then why are you wasting your precious time posting a question here?|`|I6dcRgD6aa	When Clinton was in office everyone I know was working so much & making so much money & buying things they wanted & going to parties & movies & traveling & just busy so much. I am 50 so when I was younger we didn't always have air conditioning everywhere. I remember washing dishes on the hot summer days & it was torture. I remember when nothing was on Tv. I remember not having a mircowave or cell phone or dishwasher or many other things at different times in my life. It is hard to remember how depressing it was but it really was. Bush Sr. almost ruined this country. Republicans act like Regan was great & he was horrible too. I love looking at futeristic things. I love doing what I love & being with fun people & going to great places. Get a video from the library Grapes of Wrath. If you can see the future things we could have you will see there is a difference in living a terrible miserable life to a life filled with great inventions & doing what you love all day. The more people have money the more we can do what we love to make money. So this is a little bit of an idea as to why it is important who we have for President. We need to stop things from going like they are it is bad. If we can stop it & start selling something to other countries it will be a miracle & we can recover so Obama is doing what he can but it depends on what the people in the country do in an innovative way. Republicans talk about the importance of business but they are not creating anything for us to sell & recover so they are not doing any good. We really depend on each other to live a good life. Some people make money from brainwashing people to hate a democratic President b/c the dem is for hte people & not for the CEO;s who are so greedy or the drug companies etc. So some are brainwashed & others try to wake them up.|`|AA11369432	I  care ...How it affects me and my family.|`|oTqZm4NFaa	This must be a joke..|`|4woDH5Inaa	Because what he does may very well affect you one day.

Gn6jwmzCaa	It depends upon whether or not the family can afford to raise that many kids. If they can afford it then yeah of course it is fine...but the moment that woman (in this case the woman HAD a choice) files for welfare of any kind the State should come in and remove the kids and put them up for adoption.    I really don't want one penny of my tax dollars spent to support a freak show.    There should also be laws in place to stop the fertility "experts" from conducting these kinds of experiments.|`|58607c6ba5c8f548e69203c94d723527aa	For people who use children as a source of income from the government, yes.|`|lRmhwiYpaa	NO~but don' t you think this type of thinking was done for a reason?  Mormons believe in having as many Children they can have~so did the Black Panters too|`|2gx2LgzEaa	NO.    You should watch the movie fortress... opens all sorts of cans of worms that you really dont want to go down. Granted its sci fi fiction, but if theres amovie about it, it means someone has thought about it.    Then again think about it... how many famous people have been diagnosed with aids, and how long are they still around? Magic Johnson for instance....    Still dont thin theres a cure? it all comes down to population control and money, and its all kept quiet.    how long has cancer been around? yet we find a cure for limp D*ck first...    Medical priorties or something else?    Federal funding should be stopped after X amount, THAT would help pop control from the people wanting to milk the system with kids.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	no|`|8tf5rOXdaa	Nope. Doesn't sound much like freedom to me.|`|YZdTBWoCaa	What should limited is how many viable embryos a fertility clinic can put in a womb. This also brings up the abortion issue. She was not counseled as to the problems that lay ahead if she were to try to carry 8 fetuses.  The woman was nuts ! There has to be a sane policy on this kind of sh!t !|`|Hcg2juS7aa	No, if we did that we'd be China.|`|SGwkPy62aa	Obama is working on it.  He is already sending our tax money to other countries to fund abortion as a form of birth control, it will not be long before his voluntary civilian police start showing up at Americans doors with coat hangers.|`|7pf2pGBUaa	you should have a limit on how stupid you can be|`|pVdV4gwgaa	No! We are not China!|`|19L99wvCaa	No. I suspect that this woman has mental health issues. She most certainly cannot be considering the well being of any of her children in doing what she has done. Those poor kids will not have the individual attention and care that every child needs to develop well.|`|bQLQdRBZaa	No.     Some wanabe dictator is always whining that they want to "limit" other people's freedom. Usually with some stupid excuse like "I don't wannt my tax money used for such and such."    These petty dictators are always the ones sucking the most at the government teat.  And want to get more of whatever they are getting for nothing, I guess.|`|0d98b44d962e705484337a48e0b25b85aa	You are right, Honorable Chairman Mao.|`|63f94a5a994ccc0cca358ddcef453f65aa	No, I do not want the government run my life. However, I'd support setting and enforcing certain standards of parenting. I do not believe someone with 14 kids would have much time for any one of them.|`|FrfdKKGWaa	No, the govt should not control how many kids one should have.|`|E72VO2iSaa	Absolutely, but we are not going to.  A major reason that the Mexican economy is always in the tank is that their parents have kids with no thought to the economy consequences.  Mexico has many natural resources but it can not produce enough jobs for a nation of brooders.  Many Mexican families have more children than a hen has chicks.  Our problem here is due in no small measure to that problem swarming over our border.
EuGsGfuJaa	In the State of Massachusetts, there are specific variants of knife that are illegal, such as switchblades (this includes Assisted Opening in Mass), any knives with double-edges, and the extremely rare ballistic knife.    However, it is legal to carry a conventional folding pocket knife and it also legal to carry a "butterfly knife."  State law does not dictate a limit on length.  However, the law of some cities in Mass does.  For example, in Boston it is illegal to carry a knife with a blade longer than 2.5 inches unless you just purchased it, are getting it fixed, you are hunting/fishing, or you use it for work and that work normally is known to require a knifes (i.e. chef, contractor).|`|6SJ8QHKcaa	Only if you're arrested then you would get accused of concealing a weapon!  Cops are idiots, for the most part & they will try to railroad you every chance they get!    Pocket knives are carried by a lot of people, including women!  It doesn't mean DANGER.  And ... you can't carry it on a plane!|`|c07v7O80aa	The blade length maximum is a matter for your state's law. No one can say without knowing your state.|`|XgMqcXsPaa	everything's a crime, any more|`|c6e4f1055e2cd01c39d43355e5af4d01aa	Don't know about Mass law but in Texas you can carry a folding knife with a 5.5 inch blade as long as it is not double edged or an automatic opening knife. The one I carry has a 5 inch blade! Its more like a pocket sword! I have been arrested with it and everytime they give it back to me when I  get out.|`|9gsm05lnaa	The blade cannot be over 6 inches long. it cannot be a switchblade, butterfly, or double sided knife.|`|CUPsQ4tRaa	In the United States, the laws, limitations and restrictions vary from state to state and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction within the states.  This makes it impossible to give you one boiler-plate answer that will cover all situations.

Something along the lines of 15%.       The majority of this bill is actually social program spending and payback by Demecrats to their supporters for electing them.

It has more to deal with promoting communism and its ideals, and why it would work.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzVf4oVPu...|`|tuChBv6Eaa	even tough im a liberal  communism is DEAD!!!!|`|RTBuK59Daa	As long as we don't blow our earth up in the near future, left will continue to go to the right and right will go to the left,  We are already seeing the USA tighten up on its governments control of more things as seen primarily in communist run countries.  And, Russia and China have been working on more democratic and capitalistic ways of doing things because they know it works. When everyone finds that middle ground, there could be a more friendly world, and eventually 1 nation called Earth.|`|BXLCiCUlaa	Communism would be OK IF it actually worked, but nations need leaders, and communist countries often have selfish leaders that want lots of power.    Democracy is better because theres less oppression and with capitalism, you are in charge of your own future.

Grow up and accept it.You are an immature little kid whose father should cut him off to force him to grow up.    The officer isn't supposed to put the fine on the ticket because it depends on your priors. They never put that on there.    Instead of expecting daddy to take care of you or your sister to deal with it, do the GROWNUP thing and take care of it yourself. See if you can go to traffic school or pay your own darn fine. Then give your car back to daddy because you don't deserve it and learn to take the bus.|`|XyXDs8vcaa	You're lucky that you just got a ticket.

s1LfdCdsaa	If you elected either "single zero" or "married but withhold at a higher single rate" you should get the maximum back. Depending upon your annual earnings, you may qualify for earned income credit.    Try Googling "Federal Income Tax refund calculator online" or something like that. You may be able to enter in your gross annual earnings, amount of Federal tax withheld and filing status like "head of household" and get an idea of your refund amount.

Please stop blaming the officials for everything that occurs in this country|`|I6dcRgD6aa	What do you think anyone can do? The National Guard has been sent out, etc. Should we all get in our cars & go have a slip & slide on the roads. Honestly tell us what else the President should do? Bush would not even let the people in authority move forward. Obama has in no way done anything like that. He has done his job but no one person can run out to everyone on the news & save them. We each have our role to play & when there is a disaster like there is in Kentucky it is best to stay off the roads. Please ad to your comment what you think Obama should be doing & if you make any sense I will be in full support of your complaint & rally people around you to get whatever it is that you think should be done. I will check back & I will star your question so others have a better change of seeing it. I am seeing so many republicans come up with such ridiculous questions on here & this one appears to be another one based on guilt for what Bush did. If it is a valid question though your clearly stating what you expect Obama to do that he hasn't done will be brought out to the attention of others. If you don't have a suggestion than you are a troll & just whining about Obama for no reason. So now is your chance to be a real man & do something. Explain what should be done that isn't being done. Should he take a helipcopter & hair dryer to unfreeze the wires. Seriously, what should he do?|`|todJGCP8aa	People are freezing all over the country,,not just rural KY. Never stopped Bush from enjoying a good party, did it?|`|LJ2OqF1saa	these politicians are about to freeze to death because of no power, so therefore they do not care.  They only care when it is an election year.  Just like with the economy being so bad and Obama spent $170M for his inauguration party, the largest amount ever spent, sure the man deserved a party, but he should have not spent no more than $45M....Obama's party was 4 times more expensive than President Bush and Bill Clinton.  Now he is showing his true colors.....he does not care that people are losing their homes, kids are starving because of this recession.....he made sure that our tax dollars was put to great use, by spending this amount of money.|`|d3b6fdf2d631c2f5712339448db9e43caa	real men don't whine, about the superbowl and what everyone else is doing. grow up!|`|59GGw0WAaa	Look we can all get upset point fingers and belittle someone.

Why don't some of you check the ignorance before you post some of your answers.    According to the Islamic faith:  MUSLIMS MUST BELIEVE IN ALL RELIGIONS SUCH AS CHRISTIANITY, ISLAM, AND JUDAISM .    Plus, President Obama would have much better strategic and foreign communications with Arab leaders. One being he will not pronounce it AY - RAB,    A lot of middle easterners are not considered or consider themselves Arab, its become more slang.    ****&& To the trolls & haters boo-ing my answer and the other intelligent answers on here.... you just prove your ignorance further...so thank you.

Are we really dealing with human behavior and human behavior appears to be environmental determined meaning if you're raised by the Seminole Indians as a baby never saw anything else, you'd hold that values and this goes for nations, it goes for individuals, for families and they try to indoctrinate their children to their particular faith and their country and make them feel like they're part of it in which they build a society which they call "established"    "They" establish a workable point of view and tend to perpetuate that. Whereas all society are really emergent not established and so "they" fight new ideas that would interfere with the establishment. Governments try to perpetuate "that" which keeps them in power, people are not elected to political office to change things they're put there to keep things the way they are.   S  o you see the basis of corruption is in our society and let me make it clear: All nations are basically corrupt because they tend to uphold existed institution, I don't mean to uphold or downgrade all nation but communism,socialism,fascism, free Enterprise system and all other sub cultures are the same, they are all basically CORRUPTING.|`|M62b4ciHaa	If I understand the sense of your question, I'd say no.

If systems can be designed to record millions of cars entering a city, a system can be designed to halt corruption.  The key is transparency.

rttm1SLaaa	Putting money into failing banks and businesses IS NOT SOCIALISM.  Socialism is government ownership of what would otherwise be private enterprise.  Helping to keep these things afloat in hard times cannot be called socialism because it's not government ownership.  The fact that you'd claim to understand socialism in this way shows your misunderstanding of what that governmental system really is.  I can provide you an actual definition if you'd like, it's in the link below.  Here's the definition it provides:  a theory or system of social organization that advocates the vesting of the ownership and control of the means of production and distribution, of capital, land, etc., in the community as a whole.|`|IUXriZQJaa	It is rewarding failure bu funding it and punishing the successful by forcing them to pay for it.

Beautiful.    ----    Cee Cee, I'm sorry, you must not have been paying attention when we were responding to Bush doing the same thing.

Bush and Obama (and Geithner) have all been quite clear about not wanting the government to own the banks.  For the country to function it is essential that the banking system work.  When it freezes up, the economy tanks as we have seen.  Unfortunately the remedy so far, buying preference stock in the banks, has not worked which is not really surprising.  Probably the right answer is to form a "bad bank", like the RTC back in the 80s, to buy up the bad assets.

So, given that I would go for the 65 year old because he would be next on the list.  Being 19 doesn't really make a difference.  If it were your father, or grandfather, or husband you'd feel the same way over a young man with fewer responsibilities.|`|grKtTRYtaa	Please go on UNOS website.  This is the group which decides the one who gets the transplant.  It is really very complicated.  The greatest concern is who is the sickest.  You never mentioned that.  Also, who will take care of him/herself better, follow directions., if you have some support, etc.  Age is not if you are under 70. (don't know if all true in all hospitals;  It is in Mayo.)  Waiting time is no longer an issue.  Survival is certainly a concern.  Money isn't except as far as I know you have to be able to pay for it, at least in some hospitals.  So it isn't really an argument because UNOS has a rating system.  Maybe it's not to your liking, but it   is there. I am glad you are inteested in this very serious subject.  The real problem is there are not enough donors.|`|qsDCeiNNaa	brak obma would take them both and gives them to a crack head|`|2lmqtmBKaa	The 19 year old because the 65 year old has already had 65 years of life and he has a less chance of survival also|`|W07vMTQvaa	Hard choice!  Assuming they each have the same amount of time left to live without the kidney transplant, I believe the person with the higher chance of surviving the surgery should receive the kidney.      Note:  You added something about a 21 yr old in your question but I think you meant 19 yr old.|`|wxuM59d9aa	Well, usually it would go by first-come-first-serve, but I think I would give it to the one who needs it more, which would probably be the old man, given the fact that he's been there for longer.|`|jvitmEegaa	I think that the kidney should go to the 65 year old man. My reasoning is that the argument to give the 19 year old the kidney is weaker than the other argument. Just because there is a potential for something, that doesn't mean decisions should be made assuming that thing is true. Also many things make sense economically, but that doesn't mean that they are acceptable.

wFK2vVyHaa	If you are receiving Social Security disabled child benefits from the work record of your parent, then marriage would terminate the benefit, unless you married someone who is receiving Social Security benefits other than a child beneficiary under age 18 or a child beneficiary age 18 or 19 entitled because he/she is a full-time student.    An individual receiving SSI benefits only is not included in the definition of a Social Security beneficiary.    Entitlement does not end if the child enters into a same-sex marriage.    If you are receiving SSI disability, you must report the marriage.  The marriage does not terminate SSI benefits, but it is possible the income of the new partner would cause your income to be too high and that could terminate your SSI benefit.|`|73d2c6050e09443b51029990dda007d4aa	Yes and No. Each circumstance is different, and if you ask the people at the Social Security Office they wont know either.

Now you have to go to the academy.|`|hmA8nfA2aa	You would still have to go through the same steps as someone without a degree. However, having a degree will be very beneficial when trying to become a police officer. Requirements and how you become a police officer vary depending on the state and the department. As far as education goes, some police departments only require their officers to have a high school diploma or GED. Some police departments require their officers to have a two year degree or equivalent. Some police departments require their officers to have a four year degree or equivalent. Even if a particular department does not require a degree, you will have a better chance of getting hired if you have one. Some departments pay their officers more if they have a degree. Having a degree could also benefit you when trying to get promoted after you become a police officer. There are many things that you can do to increase your chances of becoming a police officer. Check out http://www.peaceofficerjobs.com for excellent information and advice about becoming a police officer. Good luck!

nfXbqCgZaa	All YOU can do is call the police and report the offense.  The police will conduct an investigation and if there is sufficient evidence, they will charge her with a crime and she COULD get arrested.  You have no control over whether she will be arrested or not, except in reporting the crime to the police.    There are certain situations when it may be okay to enter someones home to use the phone.  However, these are extenuating circumstances such as: the house is on fire.  However, that doesn't appear to be the case.|`|tVoMXFDRaa	well here is a slight problem, unless the police get evidence of her finger prints on the door, phone etc. there is not a whole lot they can do. Unless you saw her with you own eyes, or have another eye witness. Its not what you know, but what you can prove. If you can prove it, you can have her arrested for Breaking and entering. I would suggest putting up a surveillance camera in case she tries to do it again. Than you got hard evidence she was in there. Best of Luck.|`|0MunIx8raa	Can't the police take fingerprints off the back door and the phone?  I mean it would be obvious that your families would be there, but not hers.

The country wanted to get rid of anything "Bush" and did so by electing anyone besides a republican (I supported McCain but as we all know he was not the correct man to win this cycle).   Obama, in my mind, is not qualified to be the President. Not because of all the BS birth certificate crap that people throw out there all the time, but because he would be unable to receive a Top Secret clearance in any other governmental job.   Obama now has access to the country's top secret information. If Obama were not the president and tried to obtain a Top Secret clearance, he would be unable to get one because of his associations. These were thrown aside during the election but if you have ever had to get a governmental clearance of any type, you know the background check which goes with it. Obama would not pass a background check.  My over all experience has been the the blatant and outright bias that the media showed Obama and the outright bias it showed against McCain/Palin (Palin especially).|`|DmtpQgBbaa	he sux|`|0c7f90870a573719359927fff0e69d05aa	I think the whole campaign was used by the book "Rules For Radicals" which was written by some marxist guy in the 60's.

Let me tell show you a little of what it has to say in the Third Geneva Convention  Article 4 section 2 (2) Members of other militias and members of other volunteer corps, including those of organized resistance movements, belonging to a Party to the conflict and operating in or outside their own territory, even if this territory is occupied, provided that such militias or volunteer corps, including such organized resistance movements, fulfil the following conditions: (a) that of being commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates; (b) that of having a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance; (c) that of carrying arms openly; (d) that of conducting their operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war.  Did you see the part about a fixed distinctive sign? Kinda like a symbol of uniform that separates them from us or civilians in appearance. There is also the small bit at the end about operating in accordance with the laws and customs of war. This means you should not do things like, place bombs to specifically kill civilians especially women and children. It is defiantly out of the question to take hostages and really a big no no to behead them and drag them through the street. This is just part of the list of horrors committed by the detainees and those like them. So should they be put into our legal system? Unlawful combatants have never had that right before in this country or any other. But lets say we do, then what. The decisions on these cases will undoubtedly affect unrelated cases in this country. Could a terrorist decision make it harder to prosecute our own murderers? We wont know till it happens. What ever happens in this next year, there are a lot of things to be decided. Lets just hope that who ever is making the decisions is thinking about more than what they would like to happen.|`|8SFoQvVLaa	Because it should be closed.  Its a disgrace and an administrative nightmare.|`|4JqANGNgaa	So that the people who want to kill americans can have more rights that they would not recieve at GITMO.

He is closing it in 1 year, not for 1 year.|`|X1yZOMYHaa	He's closing it in a year, permanently. That's the order. It's illegal under US law and it's tarnished the image of the US abroad. The place condoned torture and the detainment of "enemy combatants" indefinitely without a trial.    I'm not clear on why it's being closed myself, but only because apparently the Obama administration has left itself wiggle room to still detain people indefinitely without trying them in a court of law.    A rose, or rather, a weed, by any other name or location is still just that.|`|HHv2qGGcaa	IN one year.|`|MZDkfIZPaa	my opionion is that its the first step that *** hole has in crashing the country. why the hell would e close the biggest housing prison for terrorist's? and than he accepts them into the USA. i live in PA and our govener said he would take some of the prisioners to our state. u know what i say??? NOT IN MY BACKYARD HELL NO... **** him, **** obama.|`|mlY4GwQYaa	because he is an asshole|`|nZmwbFPoaa	I think its so stupid hes closing it. Most people argue that messing with people that want to kill us is wrong (witch i cant see that) i say he should keep it open for the national security. I say if a person is shooting or going to attack a US citizen he should be in a military court not a civil court because the civil court could easy let him free because he wasn't shooting any of them. On the other hand a military trial would easy send the guy to jail.

I hate to use Wikipedia, but they have the best summary of why this is wrong:    "Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has been subject to false claims in chain e-mails and in the American blogosphere such as Gateway Pundit,[7] Newsbusters,[8] and Free Republic claiming that she and/or her husband own stock in Del Monte and that she has thus pushed for keeping the tax loophole for Del Monte.[9] Those claims partially originated in vandalism of this Wikipedia page.[9][10] In fact, neither of them own any such stock.[9] Pelosi has not received any contributions of $200 or more from Del Monte employees as well.[10] Democrats who have worked with Pelosi say that Del Monte representives have not talked to her at all.[6]    American Samoa non-voting delegate to the United States Congress Eni Faleomavaega, a Democrat, wrote an open letter to Del Monte on May 11, 2007 that read:        Throughout the minimum wage debate, Del Monte has chosen to remain silent while Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has been unfairly attacked by Republicans who suggested that she received campaign dollars from you in exchange for lower minimum wages in American Samoa. As you know, neither Speaker Pelosi nor I have ever received or accepted one penny from Del Monte or Star Kist and a respectable company would have gone on record and made this known.

Starkist employs a huge majority of Samoans on the island and if they were to leave, their local economy would collapse leaving the people dependent on the United State's welfare system. The general cost of living in AS is relatively cheap.  You all seem to think increasing a wage to a lower income area helps boom the economy, but it's the opposite.    American Samoa lacks certain economic development that other territories have received.  Their healthcare facilities are dismal.  They have absolutely LITTLE technology to help with things such as Radiological Technology and Cancer treatments.  Due to little economic activity, funds have been cut to send Islanders to mainland hospitals in Hawai'i and New Zealand.  Simply put, American Samoa NEEDS these funds.  They could potentially start bringing in more healthcare staff members and doctors who specialize in key things to help boost the health and economy.

Ronald Reagan changed the way that Americans think about the role of gov't in our lives.   He cut taxes slightly but his budgets were larded with defense excesses and he had to borrow HUGE amounts of money to pay for it.

Here it is:    American business had no choice but to outsource many of the products they need because of the overly stringent environmental regulations that make industry too expensive if not down right impossible in the United States.  This left our American companies no other choice.  Any industry that uses lead, solvents, asbestos, poisons, acids, fluorocarbons etc. have been literally priced out of the market by environmental regulations.      Now add in constant increases in labor costs such as ever increasing minimum wages, mandatory family leaves as well as the world's most liberal court system that permits frivolous lawsuit after frivolous lawsuit resulting in high insurance costs and you can see why outsourcing was not only attractive but absolutely unavoidable.     Where is the anger about that?    *|`|Un986lZnaa	not going to happen   the dems need the money for the re-election

yprHJNHAaa	Of course it is irresponsible....just like their behavior in the Congress has been irresponsible for the last two years filibustering everything so nothing would be passed.  The Dems did not have the 60 votes to override their filibusters or override the Bush veto.  The republicans are acting like a bunch of spoiled brats that didn't get their way so they are doing everything to make sure nothing gets passed in Congress.    I certainly hope the American people are smart enough to see what they did the last two years.  I think it is pretty bad when you have a republican bragging that because of him the levies broke in New Orleans.  Republicans are mean and spitful and they should all be voted out.  They are acting just like their leader Rush...but we cannot afford this type of behavior...they are the ones who caused all the problems.  Reagan started the deregulation....and people like Phil Gramm continued....the Phil Gramm that said the economy was in good shape and the American people were whiners.  McCain who parroted the remarks by Gramm....then the banks failed.  Sure makes the republicans look like they have NO creditability.  Why do people vote for them.  Oh yeah...low taxes, but these people ran up a huge deficit and do not want to pay it down.  Do the republicans think they don't have to pay their bills?  They don't have a clue about fiscal responsibility!|`|FUL3Ez2Iaa	It is irresponsible to push it through with so much pork and so little to actually stimulate the economy.

We need to look at programs and publish who wants what. Make the shady deals from dark rooms find the light of day.|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	I hope they prevail. If you look at the so called stimulus package realistically, there is just to much junk in it to be effective when it comes to solving the problem. We need to step back and take another look...and this time without worrying about how much of a hand out goes to anyone. The only way to save our economy is by either preventing lay offs or by creating jobs. Hopefully our next move will do both...but this current package just doesn't make the grade in my opinion. We have to look at the cause of lay offs for example. Are all the businesses that are in trouble ...in trouble because of poor management? Or are a good portion of them in trouble because of the economic downturn? We need to look at what businesses were making a reasonable profit before the downturn...let's say about last March or so...then support them now to keep them viable. Maybe it should be done through tax credits or by providing cash so their current employees can keep their jobs. Either way, it needs to be done. Direct cash to individuals at this juncture would not do much to stimulate purchases as most people would use the money to pay off current debts....or would put it in the bank in case they were the next layoffs to occur. We need to be able to keep the jobs that we still have...and that requires support of businesses.....but with strict oversight to make sure the money is not used for anything other than to retain employees or to create new jobs. Once our jobs are secure, the people will once again have the confidence to start spending again...and that spending will improve the businesses and allow for more hiring. The key to the entire recovery is to protect businesses that have been run properly. Not to the ones who give big payoffs as the business goes down the tube, nor just letting things slide while the business sinks into failure. Poorly run businesses deserve to fail...and we all will be the better for it. But vital businesses, those that are having a hard time staying viable since their customer base has disappeared need our help....and that is where the money should go.|`|4dLPiqlZaa	The government cannot rescue our economy only we can.  The little money that you will get will not help you in the long run.  It has been proven that any stimulus money that people get is mostly spent on non esential and pleasure related items and does not help their economic status as it is gone as soon as it is gotten and the businesses that recieve it only get a onetime boost from it.      Also, that money that is so easily handed out by the government has to come from somewhere.  And the somewhere is your pocket, either sooner or later.  The government doesn't have a money tree.  Read this article and see why government spending does not spur economic growth  http://www.heritage.org/research/budget/...    The government didn't make this economic mess why would you want or expect the government to fix it? The people who buy, sell and trade make the economy good or bad, that is us.  When the economy is good people are buying, selling and trading commodoties, goods and products at a price that is not inflated or deflated.  We, the people of the US have had a good time spending money we don't have (credit), and getting things we don't need, living in houses that are more than we can afford (given generously by the mortgage comany wanting to make money), big corporations hand out big bonuses, salaries and perks, and now we are reaping the consequences of that lifestyle.       The government cannot make me spend any money for a new car, a bigger house, or to start a business.  We do these things because we want to, whether or not we can afford to.  If you want the economy to become better you need to not expect a quick fix and let this correction in the economy (what goes up must come down) balance out again.  We, the people of the US, can help this by tightening our budgets, living within our means and not expecting the government to fix a problem that we have made.  Unfortunately we are not going to have it as good as we have in the past, we have to take care of each other, helping each other get through this.    It isn't a Dem/Rep. hate issue.  It is a lifestyle that we have choosen and we have to change the way we live.  In a Socialist, Marxist, Communist etc. government, the government runs everything and everyone.  Telling you what you can and cannot do, and regulating everything including what you make, buy, sell, or what job you work at and your paycheck.  The government controls.  Is that what you want?  The government to solve all your problems?  Or do you want a free country where you make the choices, good or bad?    We have a free country and that sometimes means disagreement.  Our founding fathers set up our government with "checks and balances" so that no one branch or person could control or push through a bill, law etc.  Sometimes the quick fix isn't the best fix.|`|cWmx0J4jaa	yes, it is irresponsible to try and pass a plan that is over 80 percent pork spending.|`|8SFoQvVLaa	They are just playing politics.|`|C2HHfun2aa	No but the Obama economic rescue plan is irresponsible because it isn't a economic rescue plan it is a pork bill.    Illegal aliens and people who don't pay taxes will get tax refund checks.    It has $4 billion to go to community stabilization which will go to people such as Acorn.    There is $2 billion for the National Park Service which is the same amount as their entire yearly budget.    Most of the money doesn't get spent until the end of 2010 which just happens to coincide with Senate re-elections!    Explain to me how any of the things I mentioned stimulates the economy.|`|AMCuX8XPaa	Well, they'll get defeated - but Barack wants to be nice to the republicans - so I say - good going - Obama all the way!      But if I was in the White House, a few of those republicans would be in Federal Prison along with Bush, Chaney, Rove, Rice and Rumsfeldt.    So I say to the republicans:  Get down on your knees each day and thank your infernal god that I am not your President!  With Barack you got a nice guy - I would be far less understanding.|`|75977462e20038311663eefd8f52cc2daa	after the debt they've run up, they have absolutely no claim to honesty at all.    clearly there's spending in it.  that's what needs to be done.  spend money on infrastructure that will (A) be useful in the future, and (B) provide jobs now, to help ward off some off the worst effects of the recession.     clearly, it's political.   and politically, they lost.  unfortunately, not by quite enough in the senate.   however, if through their efforts, this recession is still going on in 2 years, they will clearly lose more senate seats, and become nearly a 3rd party.|`|i4XyIfx7aa	Obama's best option is to hide his hidden agendas if he wanted to last longer..    Why not come out with economic solid solution? Remove the Fed out of sight|`|AA11086243	if they keep stonewalling... for a month or two    and things get much worse...    it will start getting ugly for them...
4woDH5Inaa	Probably. The GOP needed a token black anyways.    But, nonetheless, I still congratulate Steele on his accomplishments, and wish him the worst of luck.|`|VDgLVHtGaa	No, he will be out of office in 2 or 4 years when the Dem have at least 69-72 senate seat.|`|P5ZkSjyQaa	Appointing Steele is an adverstising gimmick.  Nothing more.|`|uFTO5rs8aa	Give Black people some credit; they will see through this clear attempt at use his skin color to get votes.    If McCain had one you would probably never see Mr. Steele anywhere near the Republican Chairmanship.|`|zFsTSrOcaa	McCain was never the favorite candidate of conservative Republicans.  If he had won the presidency, the RNC would have been even more conservative in choosing a chairman, and Steele barely won the chairmanship as it is.  The southern white constituency has nowhere else to go, and the RNC knows it; they'll put up with a little grumbling from the base if they think they can peel off a few Obama supporters with an otherwise meaningless gesture.|`|2kgTdNRQaa	We don't care what happens to Steele and the Republican Party in 2012.  All we know is that President Obama will win reelection.|`|3c91df9cab412a7ca4201cdaf64121e3aa	It wouldn't happen.    The GOP is using him to gain some favor with those that they lost to in the previous election.  They lost big time in the minority vote, and they are looking to gain a bit of favor with them.    This is nothing more than a way to try and boost the membership in the RNC.  Nothing more.  I don't think that they are that open minded as of yet.|`|AA11598520	Exactly. Only Black Democrats get where they are on merit. Racist much?|`|UkKGsHU3aa	Why are democrats always so obsessed with race? Could it be that they are the most racist of them all? Can they not accept the fact that Michael was the best man for the job? Nah, it's gotta be becuase hes black right?!|`|g0lKlQGnaa	Like in the same way Obummer was used as a tool to get votes??    It's funny that all you race baiting libs fail to realize that before Obama, the republican party had easily the most blacks in high ranking positions    Do the libs have a Condi Rice, Clarence Thomas, or Colin Powell? Factually it's pretty evident that most of you libs are racist hypocrites|`|77lIzq4Taa	McCain would have had a huge input as to who would have been the next GOP Chair if he had won. I have no idea who he would have pushed. I do know it would not have been a Conservative.|`|a6k5WZxGaa	Probably not because Duncan would have taken credit and likely been selected again.|`|cc3820a15b7c09ec25ef5a6c571f58b7aa	He's not so it doesn't matter.

GJB: African Americans have been Dem supporters for decades.  Where have you been?|`|zt4GmLDBaa	My question is.. why in hell is there even such a thing as a "black Republican" site?    Is there a red, white and yellow one too....I am so sick of this separation of colour!|`|nXLvDjqPaa	that site only contains 5% of the black vote.|`|EOhDZQDHaa	What is that? More racist crap Obama got started?|`|Ef9zLkOTaa	The problem is that the Republican party feels it needs to attack groups like they need to go out and get the black vote, the hispanic vote, the women group.  They need to stop putting people in groups.  They had their ideal of a perfect candidate in McCain and he fell flat on his face because the American people didn't want another RINO/NEO-CON in office.  The people want someone who is going to bring small/limited government, low middle class and business taxes, and give them their rights.  This is what wins land slide elections.  Reagan v Carter...|`|cWmx0J4jaa	I'm Indy conservative. But I have noticed that since the Repubs nominated a black leader, EVERY Lib on this board is incensed by this. Cannot a black man be an intelligent conservative? How is it racist to chooose the most qualified? WHY is color such an issue with Libs? Even Obama got what, 95 percent of the black vote?    How about we vote for policies instead of skin color?|`|yZXe2XLlaa	They will make inroads with hispanics first, it will be a while before Blacks will vote for republicans,even if they put up a Black candidate that would only raise cynical suspsicions of tokenism.    Blacks do not trust Republicans. Historiclly, they shoulnd't trust Democrats, go figure.|`|eu6UQElYaa	Now that Obama is President, Democrats suddenly feel they are champions for African Americans when they have a long history of racism and it's Republicans that have put more African Americans into positions of power than the Democrats ever have.  Why is that?|`|lpwcqkNbaa	Who cares what they think they are no longer in the power.|`|cl9Ghxrlaa	Say, I don't use that site in any arguments.  Actually, I don't bring race into any of my arguments.    If you want to be honest about things, Democrats are the ones who pull out the race card every chance they get.  Just like you are with this question.

And this money was not his to spend.<br>  <br>  NEVER in the history of the world has anywhere near this amount been spent in the span of 4 WEEKS.<br>  <br>  This is the first time ever that the American national debt has DOUBLED in four weeks.<br>  <br>  you are comparing apples and oranges here.|`|DgfEkFGLaa	Unlike the TARP passed under Bush, the reinvestment bill does have over sight. So much so that some Republican Governors threaten not to accept the money. The spending can also be tracked via a new web sight:<br>  Welcome to Recovery.gov<br>  Recovery.gov is a website that lets you, the taxpayer, figure out where the money from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is going. There are going to be a few different ways to search for information. The money is being distributed by Federal agencies, and soon you'll be able to see where it's going -- to which states, to which congressional districts, even to which Federal contractors. As soon as we are able to, we'll display that information visually in maps, charts, and graphics.<br>  And I did email my Senators and asked them to vote NO to the TARP bill and was ignored. The Senate said that the 3 page bill passed by the house was a blank check to Wall Street and that they were going to add over sight. They added 140 pages of earmarks and NO oversight at all. I told them not to expect my vote in 2010 so I am holding them accountable. To add insult to injury they closed their session knowing that there was an automatic pay raise in place for them. They could have rejected that pay raise, but they did not. That is on Both of the super parties, there is no denying it. In 2010 I want to see all those self serving lifers out of power. I want a new Congress that wants the change that Obama was elected to bring about.|`|2f8fcc269ee1c0aaa19aed69d01a15ccaa	Yes we did after 6 years we voted for dems because we where sick of the earmarks. <br>  However this new adminstration is spending way more then ever before. Bushes budget deficit was at $500 billion at the most. Obama is all ready at 2 trillion. Do not confuse this with the national debt.|`|IG8s8UnSaa	As a conservative, I do agree that Bush had some reckless spending practices.  Why is Obama increasing the problem  tenfold with the same bad spending practices?<br>  <br>  <br>  You speak like a true liberal.|`|c6b7a10c63265cc871ef2c76bb9a82c4aa	Nope.<br>  <br>  You conveniently forget that the Democrat controlled Congress voted for that one too.<br>  <br>  Hack that.<br>  <br>  Nice try at the spin.<br>  <br>  No sale.|`|pnZssBg9aa	It is sheer hypocrisy indeed.

One of my Senators, Tom Colburn, was always decrying the excessive spending of the Bush administration and he wasn't the only one. Unfortunately, most forgot they were republicans during this time and started spending like democrats.|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	It seems they have forgotten about the eight long years we had to endure GW.  They skip that and go right to blaming Carter and Clinton.  It is best to ignore their rantings and enjoy life.  Obama has been in charge for one month and they pounce.  Where were they when their last leader was spending money like a drunken sailor?|`|U50orfPhaa	Obama has spend more in one month than we spent on the war in 7 years!!!!

Do think AL QAEDA won't hear about this?

If what Bush did was so bad, why is Obama doing the same thing in a shorter time frame?<br>  <br>  Every day I see an accusation that the GOP didn't voice doubts about Bush's stimulus spending, by people like you because such an accusation is convenient.  Unfortunately, it couldn't be farther from the truth: the majority of Republicans, citizens and representatives in government, were against Bush's stimulus packages.|`|gjaPNWbTaa	Although I was certainly never happy with Bush's crazy spending, it was never even CLOSE to a $1.75 trillion deficit.  That is terrifying.  <br>  <br>  The TARP was a rotten idea, but both parties were solidly behind it.  You can blame Obama as much as you can blame Bush for that one.<br>  <br>  Bush completely lost his way in the last 18 months of his presidency and signed every stupid spending bill they put in front of him.  It was awful.  And it's getting worse.<br>  <br>  And by the way, hypocrites?  To a great extent, yes.  That doesn't justify following stupidity with even greater stupidity.|`|YaTgrhr9aa	"Presdent Obama puts astronomical $4 trillion price tag on new budget"<br>  <br>  "That will be a whopping $1.75 trillion more than the President expects the government to raise in revenue, creating the largest federal deficit in real dollars since the country was fighting World War II."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2009/02/26/2009-02-26_presdent_obama_puts_astronomical_4_trill.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics...</a><br>  <br>  Better catch up on current events there Sparky, your 'golden boy" has just set the record in spending more than Bush spent|`|DypTl9Zdaa	The loudest and most honest thing you said in this entire tirade was "who cares"!

lECmz3SEaa	it is called debt and dumb@@@ package|`|2j84hXguaa	Well its debatable whether this is in our long term interests or not.  However, the idea is that by spending this money and stimulating the economy, we get out of this recession faster.  Then next year because we are all working and paying income taxes we can start working to pay it down.  So we can pay more taxes to help pay for what we spend today, plus less people lose jobs.  If it works that way.  It is what we are hoping.   No one knows for sure.  You might be right that we ought to just let the market mechanism handle it.  But Mr. Obama will be held accountable in the court of public opinioin as will all our other elected leaders.  They will lose their jobs if they arent seen as doing something, helpful or otherwise.  So the final blame lies at the feet of uneducated voters who believe politicians control the economy.  You can blame them for trying to give us what we want.|`|zHmZkMStaa	Personally; I think it should be called the 'Undoing the Damage' package - to honor the greed and corruption, graft, and useless war-mongering of Republicans and most other wealthy Americans.  1.75 million is the price Americans must pay to offset the stupidity of voting the Republicans in, and embracing the greed culture of Wall St. and easy money at the expense of the poor and middle class.|`|3755f813b1d516d25ce2a6e43bcf7a9daa	Call it what ever you want.|`|HY1bH1Phaa	Oh but he's still trying to make history.

I hear it works wonders.|`|yvPA8FSsaa	Congratulations!  You have managed to discover the dirty little secret most people do not understand.  If you read history, you will find that in every Socialist revolution, one of the first orders of business was to outlaw religion, close places of worship, imprison clerics and other intellectuals.  The reason is that Socialism cannot exist when there is Moral Absolutism or, in other words, a God that sits in judgment of the actions of man.      The only way they can impose their control is if Moral Absolutism is replaced with Moral Relativism.  What Obama was saying in his definition of sin, is the Moral Relativist definition.  To the Moral Relativist/Atheist, there is no God to determine what is moral, there is only man.  So, yes, he and others like him do fill in the role of God with their own morality relative to the situation they find themselves in.      So, if they need to lie to get something done, it becomes the right thing to do.  If a Socialist Government decides to eliminate the disabled or the old because they "waste" valuable resources that becomes the moral thing to do.  If they decide to round up and imprison or execute people who speak out against the government then that is not only permissible but a moral imperative.      Once again, I congratulate you for your thoughtfulness.  It is becoming far too rare a commodity in America these days.      *|`|g7fPDmmxaa	It sounds to me like he really does want a single government on Earth. He was right when he said the American moment has not passed yet, but he was not right in the way he thinks he is, and the way he wants other people to think he is. The American moment began with the written line "In Congress, July 4, 1776", and still has not passed. It will not pass until the American people allow it to pass. The common American theme for 232 years has been that Freedom wil never falter, will never fail, will never be destroyed as long as there is at least one person alive who is willing to stand up for it, even against seemingly impossible odds. There has never been a period in American history where we have not had our freedoms. So, for once, President Obama, though unintentionally, actually said something of value. Of course, he twisted the context to fit his own purposes, and probably doesn't have any idea what the American moment really is. As long as there are people around to defend Freedom, she will never leave us.    "Those who would sacrifice freedom for security deserve neither."  -Ben Franklin.    God Bless America! God Bless those courageous souls who defend freedom!|`|lvBUl3Zdaa	Good job on the creative editing, maybe you can find a job from the people who send you those emails to forward.

They don't need to do much pushing, a gentle nudge will do, Republicans are the minority party, this thing can and probably will pass regardless of how congressional Republicans feel.    It's understandable, as you note in your details, most states are broke and can't do anything about it, anything that sends money their way is going to be welcome.  It's important to note though that some governors state that if they were in congress, they would not be voting for this, but because they preside over states that are broke, they are in favor of it.  In the article, it does not say that any of the GOP governors think it will create jobs, nor that it will solve the economic crisis.  It's all about the money....|`|kdvy8Woqaa	Because the GOP Governors realize that the stimulus package is needed, they see the strains in their state.

That's why Obama is pushing so hard.  The public is abandoning Obama on this bill.  They want a stimulus but NOT this BAD bill that the DEMOCRATS in Congress wrote.  It STINKS.    The GOP governors are simply making sure that if the Democrats actually pass this massive spending package, that their States will get their share of the handouts.

He also supports increased discrimination against White owned businesses in the awarding of non-merit and non-bid minority contracts. He is opposed to the death penalty and thinks that it is disproportionately applied to Blacks even though it is applied to White murderers at 500 percent higher than it is to Black murderers. He is also an advocate of more gun control legislation as well as a draconian, massively increased enforcement of the current laws. He is a servile dog of Israel and has condemned Hamas and Hezbollah as terrorists and yet said not a word of compassion for the 5,000 (half of them women and children) who have been maimed and murdered in Gaza by Israels weapons of mass destruction. He says that he would still support the Iraq War and the loss of 50,000 maimed Americans, 4500 killed and trillions in cost, even though the reason for the war (Weapons of Mass Destruction) was proven to be a lie.      Some excerpts of media and direct quotes by Steele:    RNC Chairman Michael Steele Pledges Action RNC Chairman Michael Steele Pledges Action  January 30, 2009 by Michael Thompson in Associated Content    Some delegates at the RNC Chairmans election in Washington, Michael Steeles hometown, opposed Steele on the basis that he is not politically conservative enough for their tastes. This reflects the philosophic divisions that have afflicted the Republican National Committee at various times through history, most recently during the past three years. Michael Steele opposes the death penalty and supports affirmative action, unlike most Republicans.    Steele says he want more discrimination against White-owned businesses    Michael chaired a 17-member task force devoted to reforming Marylands Minority Business Enterprise (MBE), which works to provide more opportunities for minority-owned small businesses and further spur job growth and economic vitality.

What do you need an assault weapon for, if youre going hunting? Thats overkill. But I dont think that means you go to a total ban for those who want to use gun for skeet shooting or hunting or things like that But whats the point of passing gun laws if were not going to enforce them? If you want to talk about gun control, thats where you need to start. Weve got 300 gun laws on the books right now. At the end of the day, its about how we enforce the law.

Raising people's taxes, cutting programs, raising taxes on gas, groceries, closing college branches, etc.   There are five Democrat Governor's that are strongly pushing for this as well. All across the board most Governor's from both sides are.  Looking at it from their perspective, it would be a mistake for them not to accept funds if the bill passes. Most every State needs help.   The Governor's don't have to like the package, but if it means free money and will help their States, it will help the people who live in those States in the long run as well. The States won't have to depend so heavily on traditional means to create State revenue (taxes etc).  It's my understanding that any State funds will be directed, so the money can't just go anywhere and not have a productive outcome.  CA is expected to receive a large sum.

Why work if the Government is going to give you money to live for doing nothing...|`|0c7f90870a573719359927fff0e69d05aa	everyone above me pretty much summed it up|`|q3Vo1s2caa	Soylent Green.|`|rWdYBmPmaa	He plans on taking all our money and giving us a weekly allowance.

Compassion, intelligence, free exchange of ideas and understanding would be the rule, not the exception.  National health, the environment, education and good paying jobs would be the top priorities.     Republican side:    A bunch of white rednecks living in trailers working at Wal-Mart, while the leaders all graduated from Harvard and live in mansions.  Everyone would be christian and go to church and put forth their tithe.  None of them would pay any taxes, but they would all make 5 dollars a day.  They would have the best doctors in the world, but only for those who could afford it(the leaders from Harvard).  They would all have lung cancer because there really is such a thing as clean coal.|`|6Gfz125Paa	Which would have more wars? Probably neither.

Probably liberal (most of the unhealthy states are in the south).  Which would have better education?  Liberal.  If you look at the list of the top 25 universities in the US, almost every single one is in a liberal state.|`|4Vmlf902aa	Republicans would have more wars. But they'd be a hell of a lot more experienced than libs.     Conservatives would be safer.

The Con states are the wealthiest and safest?  And all the math and science people are cons?  WHAT?  Please...  Statistics and facts are obviously not your friends.    People are fleeing the North for conservatism?  Far from it.  They're moving to the South for a lower cost of living (not a sign of wealth) and better weather.  And they're moving to states that offer good jobs and education, hence you don't see people moving to WV, MS, AL, AR, etc.  You do see them moving to FL, NC, VA and GA.  AND they're bringing with them liberal values, hence that beautiful shade of blue in FL, VA & NC on this year's electoral map.    And the crown jewel of misinformation - that liberal states have higher crime rates.  Red States made up 72% of the top 25 states in per capita murder in 2006.    http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/c...      Anyway, dividing it on Red State & Blue State lines, with the blue states come:      1. 1-15 of the top public school systems by state, and 21 of the top 25.    2. The majority of the best private schools.    3. The majority of the US Military installations, the best of those installations, and nearly the entire Navy.    4. The majority of US allies. (Remember, the world hates American Right Wingers)    5. The majority of the major markets, including the top 3, 4 of the top 5, and 11 of the top 15.    6. The wealthiest corporations    7. ALL of the financial markets (Conservatism is far from a monopoly among banking & finance, though probably a majority would lean to the right. Even still, I'd wager that more people in finance would opt to stay and work where the money is in New York & Chicago than move to any conservative state.)    8. The wealthiest and most successful sports teams.    9. The most profitable shopping districts.    10. The biggest sources of tourism.    11. The major centers of technology research and manufacturing.    12. The major centers of medical research, most of the top hospitals, and most of the top minds in medicine. (the majority of doctors and medical personnel are liberals.)    13. The majority of the best universities    14. The majority of the great academic, engineering and scientific minds. (research & academia is a liberal stronghold)    15. The majority of the coasts    16. The majority of the major sea ports    17. The majority of shipping and transport    18. The majority of the largest airports    19. The majority of cultural centers - art, music, museums, theater, film, etc...    20. The majority of historical landmarks    21. And blue even makes out great in agriculture.|`|6SWmUkm2aa	Republicans on all accounts. I just had to answer your question.

We already have these types of schisms in the country.    On the one hand, look at states like Alabama and Mississippi on the far-right wing conservative side.  Racist.  Xenophobic. Segregated.  High obesity rates, poor healthcare.  Schools that are falling apart, a generally uneducated population.  Extreme, mind-numbing poverty.  They elect war-mongering Republicans.    Then look at states like California and Massachusetts.  Racially diverse.  Open-minded, tolerant (trust me, Prop 8 will be gone in a few years.)  Among the fittest states in the country.  Top-tier academic institutions that are the envy of the entire world, and well-funded K-12 education.  Some poverty, but far outweighed by the affluent and the middle class.  They elect Democrats who are oriented towards diplomacy.|`|Qbf4KSRUaa	California is the model of liberalism. Its rich in  resources, plenty of farm land, good colleges, natural beauty and its going down the crapper because it has been hijacked by liberal extremism. California is very quickly becoming the model of what not to do as far as government is concerned. NYC is another example. As soon as the next round of tax hikes come around, expect a mass exodus of people and business. Most will flee to the south which is more conservative but then the libs will start voting down here to instill more liberalism in our governments and it will start heading down the same path.|`|NfiXNNGbaa	red states take more fed taxes, because of inferior work force & inferior education system|`|DB7UMkGCaa	Actually, you dont have to split up the country for such an experiment. All you need to do is look at the conservative states vs. the liberal states.    You will notice that the liberal states are the economic basket cases, with the worst infrastructure, with the failing schools, the higher crime rates, the higher costs of living, more political corruption, etc.    You will also notice that people are fleeing the liberal states and moving into the more conservative states by the hundreds of thousands. People are fleeing liberal New York for the more conservative Florida, North Carolina, Georgia, etc. People are fleeing liberal Massachusetts for the more conservative New Hampshire. People are fleeing the liberal California for the more conservative Arizona, Texas, and Nevada, etc.     And you will also notice that this phenomena is not happening the other way around. Not many, if any, people are fleeing the conservative states for the liberal states.|`|GJJw2wszaa	Conservative would have more wars.  Liberal would be safer.  Liberal would be wealthier and are.

A very healthy general population  5.) A very well educated population    Conservative:  1.) Lots of unjustified and morally reprehensible wars  2.) Very unsafe with bigoted thugs and government goons constantly roaming the streets harrsssing and hurting citizens.   3.) A very poor general population with a super-rich elite which hoards all the nation's wealth while convincing the grossly ignorant poor that it is for their own good  4.) Very poor health due to both inability of average people to afford their medical bills as well as vast amounts of pollution from unchecked terrible environmental policies causing large amounts of people to die young from preventable diseases.  5.) A very uneducated and generally ignorant majority worshipping the educated wealthy elite who tell them exactly how to think and how to feel; kind of like how many republicans are in the south today.|`|bJiE54Qtaa	Well, this already happened with The Union and The Confederacy.

wROyZFpnaa	Yes to the first and third question. For the second your adult child(ren) can be co-owners, but I'm not sure about the inheritance tax. If you co-own with your children, the senior property tax exemption will be limited or not available though, depending on the state.      Immigration law does not restrict property ownership in any way. I know people who own houses in the USA as investment property that have never even been here and have no immigration status.       The problem is your lack of credit history may lead to a higher interest rate anyway and balance out any other positive tax incentives that you may gain. Especially with the credit tightening in the current economy, and even more so if your child has a very good credit history, since they may get better terms getting a mortgage themselves (if that is an option).        I think the best thing would be to meet with a reputable bank or mortgage broker and discuss your options.|`|krnrjNfmaa	Anyone can buy a house if you have the money.

Ms. Brown is also a coward, she offers her challenge after Rush last show of the week, knowing he cannot reply via his talk show.

This is laughable|`|xJmDP5NGaa	LEVEL playing field...you libs would not know a fair debate if it bit ya on the bum....Just look at the presidential debates....of the 3 only 1 was slightly fair the other 2 HOSTED BY OUTSPOKEN OSAMA SUPPORTERS...one of which was writing a book and if he lost the book was not worth the paper it would have been written on....Fair..you libs are such a joke...Why would your Messiah NOT debate on Fox?  Is HE a coward?|`|MEReSvZeaa	If I were Rush, I would laugh and move on.    CNN is losing in the ratings and will likely be out of business in the next 10 years.    (As a veteran with many friends and family who served in Iraq, I've heard from a number of sources that CNN intentionally edited their footage of firefights in Iraq to make our service members appear to be firing on unarmed civilians.  Until you've heard it yourself, you have no idea how livid our brave people are with that station.  Since I've heard it from more than one source, I would never give the time of day to anyone employed by that station.  The act of editing their footage in that way puts our people in danger, encourages recruiting of terrorists, and renders CNN a propaganda source, not a legitimate news outlet.)|`|PwR7SWbCaa	CNN s rating are terrible, of course they want Rush on there...Rush is better than that, hopefully he says No|`|jEqISBnQaa	Yeah, THAT makes sense; instead of Mr. Perfect having to defend his giveaway of hundreds of billions to his party's bankrollers, let's make Rush the issue. Good luck with that one! lol|`|HlD9dRF2aa	Rush has read or at least skimmed H.R.1.  If you had done the same thing with at least a 6th grade reading level you would have realized that this particular CNN reporter is trying to defend a PORK LADEN BILL.  $200,000,000 for water reclamation, $150,000,000 for national commerce commission, $10,000,000 - $300,000,000 for at least 50 agencies you probably have never heard of.  The reporter's challenge is a hollow one and their intent is either born of complete ignorance or an attempt at getting ratings for a flagging show.  You see, there is nothing in the bill that you can defend unless you believe that funding government programs with $800 Billion and giving a modicum of tax cuts to people making less than $25,000 will stimulate the economy in any way.  They give Americans 19 Billion but will end up making us pay back $819 Billion (over 1 trillion after interest).  Rush's suggestions for a stimulus package, and I will use simple terminology so that you will understand, is to give ALL the money to the taxpayers and let them spend it on the things they believe in in the form of a 6 month tax holiday.  That is the same as a trillion dollar stimulus package -- and YOU get to spend every dime yourself.  There is no level playing field here when the opposition to the person that is informed is a complete demogogue.  Rush did Velshi a favor by even acknowleging him. The word 'incompetent' was kind -- he could have called him deceitful, a liar, an economic illiterate, a socialist mouthpiece or any other set of adjectives that would have been far more suitable in my humble opinion.  I think he was kind to even stoop to give a no name liberal CNN correspondent ANY attention or free press. He's already got the attention of the white house and congress and 70% of the American conservative listening audience.   No bias no bull? Give me a break.  Skim H.R.1. American Recovery and Reinvestment Act 2009 and you'll know in 60 seconds who's blowing smoke.|`|qDsrQIhIaa	Rush would crush her even if it was in the liberals favor. The liberals I have heard on his show are absolute idiots.|`|a388e4e3066dcb4e1de9e18979b89ef0aa	if it a civilised debate...where facts must prove a point and facts will be checked....Rush will look like a bully during the debate and a charlatan afterward
Lyjy3xO7aa	The economy is consumer driven, not supply driven.  This fact will be painfully proven in the next few years, as this administration tries to revive the economy by increasing supply.    Reagonomics works because it is an economic function, it owes no allegiance to any political party.  Obamics will fail because it is essentially a political power grab, the main purpose of which, is to cover up their own culpability through scapegoating and fear.  The problems we have now are the result of government interference in the free market system.  To think that the solution lies in even more government intervention is absurd.|`|MEReSvZeaa	No matter how much you want to, you can't rewrite history.    Reaganomics is what got us out of the Carter recession of 1980-1982.    Reaganomics was credited by Clinton as the reason for his "peace dividend".    Reaganomics is what Bush used to get us out of the Clinton recession.    Reaganomics is what Obama is using right now (deficit spending).    (Oh my!  Liberals are going to hate this answer!)|`|xxDjV6Axaa	Clinton started with 4 surpluses, the most since the 1930s.  By the end of his admin, there were none.  Do you call that fixing a shamble?  I don't.|`|up363TZyaa	Reagonomics was awesome.  it totally fixed the economy !!!!  CLINTON was the one who effed up everything.   look how much inflation went down after Reagon!!!!|`|9klx10iKaa	why do liberals still believe in the Clinton economic boom, did they miss many of the ceo's being dragged in to prison for over inflating numbers?|`|nTzTIrataa	Funny you should mention that; I was just reading about it.    http://www.counterpunch.org/freeman05302...    "Trickle-down economics" set the stage for massive deficits that were only reversed during the Clinton years.  To believe otherwise is delusional.    Dick Cheney:  "Reagan proved deficits don't matter."    The hell they don't.|`|VIhj7ghUaa	What makes you think they're ever going to face reality when they can continue to blame Carter and Clinton for all their voodoo fugups?|`|B6c7BeDnaa	clinton didn't fix squat.it only works when you quit freakin spending.|`|58EydBwwaa	Some economists believe that economic policies really don't take effect until about ten years after they were implemented. That would make the successes experienced under Clinton the result of Reagan's policies.     I'm not sure I buy that 100% but I've seen a lot of evidence. Roosevelt's New Deal was implemented in 1933, but the Great Depression lingered until the end of WWII.|`|q3Vo1s2caa	Because we're still waiting for the spending cuts the Democrats promised.|`|CVVl4U4caa	Why do Liberals still believe in Obama when his approval ratings went down 9% in his first week in office? Ohhhhhhh too soon? Face it, Reaganomics, are/have helped this country out a lot.|`|ohxiNOFjaa	It wasn't very good in the short run either.|`|7e779664f2fa69c81d06551c999ec10baa	Reaganomics?    Oh, you mean Voodoo Economics.  At Least that's what the 41st President Of The United States, George Herbert Walker Bush, called it.|`|CgGVpUI5aa	Reagan presided over a doubling of the US economy.  Yup, you read that right, and I have a couple degrees in econ/ finance to back it up.    All serious economists believe that low taxes are good for business and provide more jobs for people.|`|UXKMNkdgaa	Where do you get your propaganda? Do you just make it up? The only problem with Reaganomics is that is had to be compromised with failed Democratic policies of the past 50 years.|`|xkcLOfTKaa	20 million jobs created over his 8 years in office... That was a disaster?  I guess I have a different dictionary than you do.|`|wdBY1fWaaa	Read a book sometime...it helps.|`|cWmx0J4jaa	It worked fine until the Libs decided to socially engineer the economy with minority loans, and more taxes. Had they let the system in place alone, it would have continued along fine. Just goes to show you, if it ain't broke, don't mess with it!! You cannot engineer racial justice thru the economy. Any attempt to do so undermines the whole concept of the system as colorless!!|`|bMV2VJwzaa	Clinton's success in economics was due to the system put in place by Reagan, even your precious Obama admits that and tries to fool people by claiming to want to be like Reagan.  I have to say I find it hilarious that the libs claim to hate Reagan so much, yet don't waste a second in using his name, character, and political views to get them into office.  Poor little lost and confused souls....|`|x5RFgh6Qaa	yeah, we only had a 16 year period of expansion using the same policies (expansion usually lasts 7). why do liberals still believe that socialism works after the crumbling of the USSR and the piss poor shape of france economically? remember the first 6 years of bush 43's presidency, when he had a republican congress? the most prosperous time economically in US history. economists are mostly agreeable that taxing the people that create jobs is not productive for the economy.|`|ae64cd2ae43b0a7fcd3d51ae9efe70f5aa	"Great men do not make history, history makes great men." Or, "Great Presidents do not make great economies, great economies make great presidents."|`|0c7f90870a573719359927fff0e69d05aa	It's the liberals who effed everything by trying to prevent the country from flourishing!!!!|`|SGwkPy62aa	Obviously you do not have a valid recollection of history.  This country was put into shamble first by FDR and then Carter.  Reagan started with a worse economy than Obama has, and fixed it.  Obama is trying to follow FDR, who proudly led us into the depression, while listing Carter as one of his advisers.|`|5yuZwOLQaa	Not a disaster but a blessing.  He turned our country around and Clinton inherited his good work and claimed it as his own.  I love Reaganomics and wish Bush had done more of it.|`|wOSBjO9caa	reaganomics and the even more intense deregulation of the years of total republican control of the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches are the direct causes of the current economic melt down and would have resulted in a second great depression if there had been continued republican control. Ronald Reagan was one of the ten worst Presidents this country has seen. He was a total phony who would read from a script to hide his worsening dementia. He cared not an iota for the common man, but was a typical republican, only interested in enriching his big business buddies, and laying waste to the third world.     Least we forget, it was Reagan's policies that brought:    1) Change to the federal tax system, giving massive tax breaks to the wealthy and big business, and shifting a horrendous tax burden to the middle class;    2) Change to environmental laws, wrecking havoc on natural resources, endangered species, and the health and welfare of all Americans;    3) Change to labor laws, wrestling hard-earned workers' rights from unions, and causing at least one industry, air traffic control, into paralysis, affecting the safety of air traffic for more than a year;    4) Change to American foreign policy, by selling arms to Iran, and forwarding the profits to right-wing Central American dictators to help fund their death squads;    5) Change to monetary policies resulting in his leaving office with the largest federal deficit yet seen in US history;    6) Change to education - when he could not disband the US Department of Education, as he campaigned to do - he succeeded in reducing Federal education spending by 50%, and ravaged local education control by diverting funding to the state leve.    In addition, there are millions of Californians whose minds and memories are not so feeble as to fail to remember not only the miserable years of the Reagan presidency, but the painful, bitter years of the Reagan governorship.    I for one, being a student at the University of California during Reagan's governorship, saw firsthand his efforts, and "success" in dramatically raising tuition costs while slashing budgets, terminating construction projects, firing Clark Kerr, the popular President of the University, and enraging faculty with his declarations that the state "should not subsidize intellectual curiosity".    His massive cuts to health and welfare benefits in California, and in particular, mental health care, is the single biggest cause of the massive increase in homelessness in California over the past three decades - the tossing out into the streets of thousands of sick people who could not function in society.    Reagan was a miserable President, a miserable governor, and a miserable person, whose show-biz persona produced a false image that unfortunately continues to endure.|`|1fb7aea767ff3f9acc21f4f310b2ee94aa	The sitting president has inherited the previous administration's legacies whether those be economic success or failures or wartime success or failure.  The much touted "Clinton economy" was, and shall always remain, the result of President Reagan's economic policies.  The same will hold true with the current sitting president; he, too, shall inherit the results of his predecessor's policies.  "Reaganomics" worked, it is just that Clinton got the credit because most people do not realize the slowness with which this nation's economy responds to stimuli.  Don't like this answer?  Tough.  Sometimes, truth hurts.|`|bc2cec2247bb0b16f07f82c5e2ba1ea1aa	You are so right! The pork laden, political kickback, joke of this democrat backed stimulus bill is so much better. Just remember when our economy completely tanks and the dollar is worth dirt that Republicans did not back this bill.|`|Tl1b2lAHaa	If you think about it, it really wasn't until G. W. Bush became president that everyone started thinking that Reagan was a wonderful president.  Now, Reagan was going bonkers at the end of his term, and G.W. was already bonkers prior to his taking office, so in order to make G.W. look like he was sane, and his actions were  acceptable, they had to put a light on someone who in a sense was working on the same plane as our last President.  Making Reagan an icon, made Bush look like he was right, in the sense that, he wasn't senile yet, but his actions were, however, Reagan was senile and his actions still far over shot what G. W. Bush did to our country.  Unfortunately, G.W. couldn't even snag a better reputation than the man who we knew had alzheimers at the end of his term, but that's the best person they could come up with, to make Bush look at least legitimate.|`|Wcjc8Au1aa	Because it wasn't a disaster.  It led to the longest peace-time economic expansion in the history of the country.  No one has ever been able to "cure" the business cycle, which predicts that we will have periodic recessions followed by recoveries for as long as mankind is on this earth.  People get overconfident that the economy will go on growing forever, and then they engage in economically irresponsible behavior, which then finds some way to precipitate a recession or worse.  Once people become fearful enough that they don't engage in economically irresponsible behavior any more, the recovery begins.  That's never going to stop.|`|636L1P5Zaa	I don't. I think you shouldn't spend more than you make. I pay my credit cards off every month and have no debt except my mortgage. Can't say that about the government. They spend like drunken sailors.|`|QlNbi05paa	,First of all, Bush senior left Clinton a recession, and a huge deficit. Reagan, was the beginning of budget busters, he left a enormous deficit. Reagan treated the US finances like a shopaholic with a open ended credit card. Supported Saddam Hussein ,  gave money and military training and weapons to Bin Laden, and last Iran/Contra affair  should have led to the impeachment of both he and George senior.|`|NbaMD4TKaa	Reaganomics gave the appearance of working to many people.  But really it began our love affair with debt.  US national debt took a serious upward turn starting with Reagan and continued ever since.  That's why we are in the deep doo-doo now.    If, indeed, Republicans or anyone still believe in it, it must be because they believe in the fairy tale that the debt-based consumption dream can go on... forever and ever.  They must not have been listening to grandpa when he told them there's no free lunch, you can't have your cake and eat it too, etc.

2b7VqUXXaa	Nobody gets to being a Bank executive by being stupid, or fiscally irresponsible. The Banks were told by the government to make those bad loans. Of course it wasn’t phrased that way. The government, under the guise of “Fairness” forced the banks to lend to unqualified people so they too could experience “The American Dream”. The Banks knew it was a bad idea, but they had no real choice in the matter, the Feds would withhold FDIC status if the banks didn’t go along with the plan. Sure, it was profitable for the banks on the front end, but they knew it would collapse and they’d get hosed in the end. No legitimate financial institution would have made those loans without government pressure to do so.<br>  <br>  In the same vein, I pay all my bills on time, I carry no balance on my Credit card, and I live within my means. Why then should I be forced to pay for the excessive lifestyle of my coworkers who make the same amount as me, but drive newer cars, live in larger houses, and carry thousands of dollars of debt to do it? They CHOSE to live outside their means, they played the system and gambled that if enough people did the same, the government would step in and keep the system from collapsing.|`|MQPJ2UaGaa	Sure,if I get what they bought with it or it goes to the government<br>  to be sold.|`|AA10164318	No - but I would be very happy to vote for limits on the 30+% interest rates <br>  that probably changed $500 worth of charges made at 10% into $8,000.00 of debt.|`|QQsIPlV2aa	Not Heaven, but the other place! NO!  Just like these banks and companies! They were supposedly the master wheelers and dealers! Seems like their calculators were broken, or found a way to squirrel funds out of the country, and are laughing behind our backs as they scoop up the bail out money from the Government, and plan more ways to screw the Public!<br>  I really believe, IF this money IS from our taxes, the Government should publish an accounting as to where every penny is going to,m and WHAT they are doing with it! Also WHEN are they going to start paying these "loans" back!?  I could see ONE company being bailed out, but when the GOV did, everybody and his brother wanted a piece of the pie!  <br>  If the Government holds these people to their word to pay back the money, dictating on how they are to use it etc, isn't that on the road to Socialism!?|`|6cm6MB66aa	Yeah well it is our money isn't it ?

I haven't seen anything like this...|`|AbHm1BBXaa	Do you not have agood grasp on reality?<br>  I don't need any help paying my debts off, but when someone is up to their ears in debt, and you raise their minmum payments across the board on them, what do you think that is going to do to their ability to pay their bills?<br>  <br>  lets just say for instance, after all your mandatory bills are paid you have $600 a month left over.<br>  Of that $600 left over if you are paying $400 a month in credit card payments. with a credit score of 780, while putting $200 in the bank, is that responsible?<br>  Now what haoppens when the government demands that banks double their minimum payments like the Bush admin did?<br>  lets see $400 a month credit card bills jump to $800 a month, and all of a sudden you are no longer saving $200 a month.<br>  And you have to find an extra $200 a month to meet just your minimum bills.<br>  So who was irresponsible? The person who was previously paying their bills, or the idiot in the white house who was responsble for their monthly bills suddenly jumping, along with their fuel bill quadrupling?<br>  <br>  Maybe you should figure out what is really going on before you starting jibbering!<br>  I'm not complaining myself about it, because my bills didn't get out of control, but along with the above JP Morgan took my WAMU credit account and raised the interest rate from around 15% to 25%. So I'm helping them pay for their purchase, while Paulson helps them by giving my tax dollars.<br>  <br>  i can just imagine what that would have done to someone who was actually at their limit with bills vs income. How much spending do you think that haulted?<br>  Could that be our economic problems?<br>  Maybe you should start thinking outside your own life experiences.<br>  <br>  With the stupid policies coming out of the whitehouse over the past 8 years, it is no wonder why consumer confidence is falling, and killign our economy.<br>  <br>  And anyone who says the government made banks give loans to people without checking their credit, like many of them did, is completely delusional.<br>  The costs of living went up on people who could afford the loans afetr they took them out. Many peopel found they couldn't refinance their ARMs when they tried to because property values fell. It had nothing to do with them being unable to afford the loan when they took them out, it had everything to do with their gas bill jumping from $100 a month to $400 a month, their credit card payments doubled, and food prices going up 150%, after they already had the loan.<br>  Prior to that occuring most peopel with the exception to the normal forclosure rates, were paying their bills just fine.

93M8Vccvaa	If you refuse to let an officer search your vehicle he can get a search warrant and hold you until he does. The time it takes to get a warrant varies. He has to contact a judge and depending on the time of day this may take hrs.|`|AA11494150	No, that is not completely true. The police can search a car without a warrant, so there is no need to hold you until they get one.     Warrantless searches have been upheld by the US Supreme Court. The landmark case on this is Carroll v. United States, commonly called The Carroll Doctrine.     The Court recognized two things. First of all, vehicles are mobile, making a warrant challenging at times. Secondly, the determined you have a lesser expectation of privacy when on a public road. For these reasons, and officer can search without a warrant as long as he has probable cause the search will turn up something illegal.    I tend to get a lot of "thumbs down" for this answer, so I suggest you do an internet search of The Carroll Doctrine before disagreeing with me. And because it was decided by the US Supreme Court, it applies to all states.|`|AA11622716	A warrant requires probable cause to believe there is evidence in the car.  In most states, because of the inherent mobility of a car, the cops can search with cause even without a warrant.  In some, they need a warrant but can get one issued over the phone.  If they do not have cause, they can still detain you temporarily and bring in a drug dog.  If the dog alerts, they now have the cause.   In most cases, however, if someone says no and the cop was just fishing, that is the end of it,  They leave.|`|e7SYtaIJaa	If you say no you cant search my car, then they cant search your car. A car is like your house, and the police need a search warrant to gain access to it.|`|emNCaAq7aa	If they have cause they can get a warrant. It takes time. The actual search warrant and the affidavit giving the reason they want the warrant have to be typed up. In most jurisdictions you also need the county prosecutors approval of the warrant before a judge will even look at it. The judge may actually hear testimony as to the probable cause.   They can hold the car until they get the warrant. They do not have to have the actual warrant in hand, like on TV. They just have to have knowledge that the compliant for a search warrant was approved by a judge.  A car is not like a house. it by its nature is temporary and can move. The courts have said that the car can be held while waiting for the warrant.|`|Kh4p4gPXaa	Depends on where you are.   In some places,  if they have probable cause to search the cause (the smell of weed on someone or in the car is enough),  then they can search it anyway regardless of your consent (and put you in cuffs as they do it if you are rude or belligerent about it).    Other places,   they might need a warrant to do so,  but they have the right,  and will hold you at roadside,  for however long it takes to get (could be hours or could be minutes,  depending on the day).    In the end,  if they want to search it,  it will be searched.|`|vuzi75iiaa	your dad is right. they will hold you for sure and call in the dog team, been there bud|`|ztijFfNXaa	You can be 'detained' until a warrant can be authorized. This can take a long time (hours). Most of the time our department calls a K9 unit and have the dog provide the basis for an non-consentual search.     A common scenario is that a police officer finds you in an area known for drugs. After he stops you he can't find a legitimate reason for you and your friend to be in that neighborhood other than to buy or sell dope.

Again, some states allow warrantless searches of vehicles based on different things, such as the odor of drugs or weapons.     However, if a warrant was to be obtained, the police could prevent you from moving or tampering with the vehicle until the warrant was either granted or not.
AA10284358	all Obama has to feed the people is he has to have all these billions of dollars to correct Bush's mistakes and all they have to hear is Bush and they will give him anything. That's how idiotic . brainless lot of bs. As you said he could stopped programs with a pen why use all the money we have just to show he will right Bush's so called mistakes which is all crazy anyway since it was the democrats that caused the deficit in the first place. If barney frank and Obama would have been truthful about fannie and freddie being in such a bad shape and telling bush it wasn;t it would have been taken care of , But they waited until they got money before telling how bad it was. How much of Obamas bs are the american people going to listen to. Now what is he talking 3,8 billion deficit in 2012 or was that 2010<br>  Thought he was slicing the deficit.<br>  Harvest mouse uh? Now that is very important. to who besides nancy I don't know/ only the mice/ Are people really taking him serious or do they just want to spite the republicans. where will this get them? do they think they are somehow separated that this won't touch them? <br>  I'm really puzzled by their thinking.

First, you have to acknowledge that our  economy is in very serious and dire difficulty.  Then, you have to figure out a way to address the problems, the likes of which most people have never seen in their lifetimes.  Next, you have to recognize that, contrary to your assertion, the president does not have the power "to halt any existing program." <br>  <br>  Once you are based in reality, the approach is to consult economists and try to figure out how to extricate the country from the current economic mess.  The government is the last resort because private industries are failing and are themselves looking for help.  Government spending is the recommended way to try to address the problems and stimulate the economy.  If you have a better suggestion, we all await your startling insight.|`|Nf60Q6UFaa	First you are mistaken executive orders can only over-ride previous executive orders, not "any existing program".  Laws passed by congress can only be "undone" by congress.<br>  <br>  It is a shame that we have a deficit incurred during good economic times, basic economic principles say deficit spend to get out of hard economic times, and pay it back during good economic times, if only the republicans paid attention in economics class!<br>  <br>  Finally, we have the chance to fix the "Bush problems", now get out of the way, and give him a chance.  He can not fix 8 years of poor decisions in a month!
LX6AQ4kuaa	It varies. From the application of permanent resident status till taking the oath, it is at least 6-7 years for most people. Most permanent residents have to live in the US for 5 years prior to applying for citizenship.   Exceptions are the people who get naturalized through military service (no residency time required after a green card is granted) and spouses of US citizens (spouses only have to be permanent residents for 3 years then they can apply for naturalization). Right now the waiting period for naturalization itself is pretty long and it ranges from 6 months to 12-14 months but the USCIS would like to process cases in less than 6 months but nobody knows exactly when that could become possible. It also depends on where you live in the US because some USCIS offices are a lot busier than others.|`|vFHXrOHNaa	Since just few months back it was Election season things were moving pretty fast.

He is more concerned with image and international opinion that your safety    Next he appointed a tax cheat to head up the IRS. Yes you will pay your taxes to someone who doesn't pay his.

gasquENMaa	As I am reading your question, you are wanting to own a full auto or select fire, not sell them? If so, find your local class three dealer, select your weapon and get the forms needed to fill out.    Same rules as owning a pistol. Over 21, no legal restrictions against owning weapons ( criminal history), no restrictions due to being judged mentally incompetent ( much the same as filling out the 4473 form when purchasing a handgun).    The main difference is that each weapon you buy will have a $200 fee for a "tax stamp" for that particular weapon and the application must be signed off by the Chief Law Enforcement officer of your area ( your County Sheriff). The entire process goes through your local BATF office and will take several months.    If you are looking at purchasing a full auto from a private owner ( not a dealer), you can get the necessary forms from your local office of the BATF. Look in the phone book for where they are near you.    Best of luck and I hope this is useful to you

zBSPaC70aa	Very hard.    You see, there is a huge amount of people who want citizenship, and it's a first-come-first- serve basis, so it takes time. I'll put it this way: my dad filed for citizenship before I was even conceived, and I was 6 by the time he got it. I'm 19 now, and it's even harder now.    The government does make it as hard as possible. You have to take classes - at the expense of your work hours, something very difficult for people who have a family to support financially. Also, remember that Southern California is ridiculously expensive sometimes, specially rent.  You also have to learn English - and while I don't consider this a bad thing at all, you have to remember a lot of these people are adults, and it's harder for them. Also, ESL classes are usually pretty expensive and time-consuming as well.    There are many people who are here illegally who want to fix their situation - but doing that without getting deported is devilishly tricky. I know some people who were brought as babies, and consider this their home, but are truly suffering to get citizenship.    Many people don't come legally because it's really difficult to get a Visa. For instance, in Mexico, you have to pay over a hundred dollars just to get an appointment at the embassy, eighty more to get your figerprints taken, have an interview during which you must convince them you don't want to stay in the US... then pray you'll get lucky, because those 200 bucks don't guarantee anything. Less than ten percent of people who apply get the Visa.    When you consider minimum wage in Mexico is $5.00 a day, you realize those $200.00 are a lot of money. That's why so many people would rather risk crossing the border illegally - which later gives them trouble, when they want to get their papers properly done.|`|94b58b682445a6a0a451407b9eb0fe33aa	Anyone can become an American citizen if they go the way of the Customs Services!|`|NlQpsLIHaa	It is expensive. over all i would say it cost for me and my daughter about 2500 $ and that's just for the green card then when it comes to citizenship it is another 400 to 500$ but i was lucky and got my green card in less than 3 months.   Wouldn't it be nice if you could live in which ever country you want. Do what ever you want there, work not giving money to the gov.

Honestly how many are illegal admit to it and nothing happens!   In my opinion it is not hard at all to do it the right way if you take the time. Alright you need to have the cash as well but hey if you cant afford that how can you afford living here!? The government wants to make sure no criminals try to hide out here. It wants to make sure you don't need medicaid, food stamps etc. If you can proof that you don't have problems with all that the application will be granted.

That means that he is not black, he is silver. )|`|OCc1si6Gaa	The New York Times is reporting about an "apparent evolution" in president-elect Barack Obama's thinking on Iraq, citing his recent statements about his plan to keep a "residual force" in the country and his pledge to "listen to the recommendations of my commanders" as Obama prepares to assume actual command of US forces. "At the Pentagon and the military headquarters in Iraq, the response to the statements this week from Mr. Obama and his national security team has been akin to the senior officer corps' letting out its collective breath," the Times reported. "[T]the words sounded to them like the new president would take a measured approach on the question of troop levels."    The reality is there is no "evolution."    Anyone who took the time to cut past Barack Obama's campaign rhetoric of "change" and bringing an "end" to the Iraq war realized early on that the now-president-elect had a plan that boiled down to a down-sizing and rebranding of the occupation. While he emphasized his pledge to withdraw US "combat forces" from Iraq in 16 months (which may or may not happen), he has always said that he intends to keep "residual forces" in place for the foreseeable future.    It's an interesting choice of terms. "Residual" is defined as "the quantity left over at the end of a process." This means that the forces Obama plans to leave in Iraq will remain after he has completed his "withdrawal" plan. No matter how Obama chooses to label the forces he keeps in Iraq, the fact is, they will be occupation forces.    Announcing his national security team this week, Obama reasserted his position. "I said that I would remove our combat troops from Iraq in 16 months, with the understanding that it might be necessary  likely to be necessary  to maintain a residual force to provide potential training, logistical support, to protect our civilians in Iraq." While some have portrayed this as Obama going back on his campaign pledge, it is not. What is new is that some people seem to just now be waking up to the fact that Obama never had a comprehensive plan to fully end the occupation. Most recently, from the New York Times:    "On the campaign trail, Senator Barack Obama offered a pledge that electrified and motivated his liberal base, vowing to 'end the war' in Iraq," wrote reporter Thom Shanker on Thursday. "But as he moves closer to the White House, President-elect Obama is making clearer than ever that tens of thousands of American troops will be left behind in Iraq, even if he can make good on his campaign promise to pull all combat forces out within 16 months."    For many months it's been abundantly clear that Obama's Iraq plan is at odds with his campaign rhetoric. Yet, Shanker writes, "to date, there has been no significant criticism from the antiwar left of the Democratic Party of the prospect that Mr. Obama will keep tens of thousands of troops in Iraq for at least several years to come." The Times is actually right about this, in a literal sense. There has seldom, if ever, been a public peep about Obama's residual force plans for Iraq from members of his own party, including from those who describe themselves as "antiwar."    But, for those who have scrutinized Obama's plans and the statements of his advisors from the beginning, this is old news. Obama never defined "ending the war" as removing all US forces from Iraq. Besides the counsel of his closest advisors  many of whom are pro-war hawks  Obama's Iraq plan is based on two primary sources: the recommendations of the Baker-Hamilton "Iraq Study Group" and the 2007 Iraq supplemental spending bill, which, at the time was portrayed as the Democrats' withdrawal plan. Both envisioned a sustained presence of US forces for an undefined period following a "withdrawal."    In supporting the 2007 supplemental, Obama said it would put the US "one signature away from ending the Iraq War." The bill would have redeployed US forces from Iraq within 180 days. But that legislation, vetoed by President Bush, would also have provided for 20,000 to 60,000 troops to remain in Iraq as "trainers," "counter-terrorist forces," or for "protection for embassy/diplomats," according to an analysis by the Institute for Policy Studies. The bill contained no language about how many "private contractors" could remain in Iraq. This helped shed light on what Obama actually meant by "ending the Iraq War."    Other glaring clues to the actual nature of Obama's Iraq plan to anyone paying attention could be found in the public comments of his advisors, particularly on the size of the force Obama may leave in Iraq after his withdrawal is complete. Obama has refused to talk numbers, saying in October, "I have tried not to put a number on it." That has been the position of many of his loyal aides. "We have not put a number on that. It depends on the circumstances on the ground," said Susan Rice, Obama's nominee for UN ambassador, during the campaign. "It would be worse than folly, it would be dangerous, to put a hard number on the residual forces."    But, Richard Danzig, President Clinton's former Navy Secretary who may soon follow Robert Gates as Obama's Defense Secretary, said during the campaign that the "residual force" could number as many as 55,000 troops. That doesn't include Blackwater and other mercenaries and private forces, which the Obama camp has declared the president-elect "can't rule out [and] won't rule out" using. At present there are more "contractors" in Iraq than soldiers, which is all the more ominous when considering Obama's Iraq plan.    In April, it was revealed that the coordinator of Obama's Iraq working group, Colin Kahl, had authored a paper, titled "Stay on Success: A Policy of Conditional Engagement," which recommended, "the US should aim to transition to a sustainable over-watch posture (of perhaps 60,000-80,000 forces) by the end of 2010 (although the sp|`|3c91df9cab412a7ca4201cdaf64121e3aa	One has to show PROOF of residence for a minimum of one year prior.    And most states have some sort of law like this, because it has been known to happen that (gasp) a child may be born while the parents are out of the country.  Doesn't make them a non-citizen.  Matter of fact, being that their parents are getting the certificate, it makes them natural born citizens because they don't have citizenship anywhere else.    And all you did was link us to the text of the rule.  There is nothing that states this was done for anyone. . .  You merely elude to it.  Not good enough in a court of law, and not good enough here.

That is, carrying weapons openly, wearing a uniform, not targeting civilians, etc.|`|4fda62554c07de687e2ca85293849ac6aa	The first answer is correct, and I agree.  I would only add that the war criminals held in Gitmo are not POW's they don't meet the minimum requirements of POW's.  In the case of illegal combatants.  In previous wars they were executed by the military.    So notable examples would be the German's who were caught dressed as MP's during the battle of the bulge in WII.  They were executed.  Also the German's caught dressed as civilians in Florida.|`|tpfxZZADaa	Depends on the law they break while a POW.    For example, if say a POW murders someone while interned on a POW farm, they will then face civil court for murder.  If they break a military rule or directive, for example they escape, they will be punished under the military system.    But at the moment America doesn't have any Prisoners of War, the people being held in Camp X-Ray were long ago refused the rights POWs have, like adequate food, clothing, exercise, access to IRC (Red Cross/Crescent) members, medical attention and lodgings fitting to their rank. That is why they are shutting down those torture camps, because they were made illegal sometime in the late 19th century with the Hague conventions.|`|N4u9DRvFaa	POW's are only tried if they do something illegal while being held prisoner.     The only difference between a POW and the clowns at GITMO is that the Non POWs now being held do not ever have to be released. Thats it. They still get the same treatment as a POW in regards to food,  clothing, medical care, etc, etc. The Military has control of them all so any trial would be done by the Military with a Judge not sure how they deal with the Jury issue at a Tribunal, may be a panel of Officers. It should not be a civilian court. Congress can change that, but that is the way it worked in the past.

LX6AQ4kuaa	Getting married for a green card is a felony. If you don't marry out of love, it is considered a marriage fraud. Immigration people will find out about your green card marriage fraud and you and your partner may be sent to jail for years. There have been precendents in the past couple of years that proved it is not possible to play out the authorities like that. Even if you manage to get a green card through marriage, your marriage will be under investigation for at least 2 years after you receive your green card and you have to have solid evidence to prove that your marriage is real. If you can't prove that, you become deportable if you are on a conditional green card (If you have a marriage no older than 2 years, you will be on a conditional green card for 2 years during which time you can get deported for marriage fraud).  <br>  <br>  So the bottom line is that if you wanna marry for a green card only, it will not work out.|`|VjSVztAeaa	Just because someone entered on B-1 or B-2 and later marries a US citizen who petitions for green card for the alien does not mean visa fraud.  There's a 30/60/90 day rule. Only when marriage occurs within an immediate time frame there's a presumption of fraud, a rebuttable presumption of fraud, and no fraud is presumed after a certain amount of time. <br>  If you EWI'd (entered without inspection - crossed border illegally on were sneaked in through airport around customs) not much can be done for you. Otherwise, there's pretty good chance.  Of course, your marriaae must be bona fide - married with intent to build a life together as a married couple.|`|bfDFWqc5aa	If you marry a US citizen whether its for love or not there will be an investigation.

Whether or not Congress passes a clarifying act clarifying the Presidents Constitutional authority to either sign the act into law or veto the act and disavowing any authority to "Signing Statements" and an act affirming that The Executive Branch is bound by the same laws as evey other citizen will determine how successful GW Bush was.

If that's not something you want to do, I'd recommend something more vocational like business.    However, economics is the second-highest paying undergraduate major (after engineering), so I'd say you made a pretty good choice.|`|MEReSvZeaa	No.    If you want a job at all, you'll stear way clear of politics.  It's like art:  you'll starve throughout your life.    If you want a job in finance or advising or management of any kind, you'll end up back in school as an accounting major.  Accounting majors are usually chosen above finance and economics majors because of recent laws that require accounting expertise.  Accountants are the ones being promoted to management and finance officer positions to help companies comply with things like COSO and SOX standards.|`|A6Xjzhdaaa	yes. no|`|6cd7cae3f8d44a82dd6c9bf47a165cd6aa	No and NO|`|lpwcqkNbaa	Economy is in such a bad shape i don't think you're going find any nice paying job however you might find a job at Mcdonald's   I'll come for some hamburgers and fries|`|whE5OQ26aa	Sadly, no. I'd get a teaching certification.    Find a major that will get you a job, or better yet, just get certified to do something at a community college. Go to a smaller school and get a business degree, accounting is better. You will have a four-year degree and a major that will get you respected at any company. Most of the bigger schools are just liberal art degree mills.    If you are unfortunate to graduate with those degrees, you're best off joining the military as an officer, even enlisting isn't bad. Police departments will be very open to hiring you, as long as you stay in shape. Management in the retail and restaurant sectors will be a good place to look too. There are several opportunities too in becoming a corrections officer. You can also teach, it's not hard at all to be a substitute teacher, and you can get your teaching certification if you want while you're doing it.    The economy will swing back up soon, fortunately, so you might be lucky.

eu6UQElYaa	Actually, you probably have a much bigger heart and a much smarter head than a liberal.  Studies show that conservatives give more of their time and money to charities than any other group.  They tend to support churches which have done more for the poor, homeless, downtrodden, children, handicapped, etc. than any half baked liberal government run program ever has.  That's just the facts of the matter.  Liberals don't like it, but the numbers back it.|`|EhoJ9mgsaa	I read you're question and had to do a double take :)    early twenties, believes in free market economics and limited govt........Good for you.    What Churchill was saying was a veiled insult to liberals.    Why?    Most liberals think in idealistic terms which include "saving the world from all it's evils" usually with govt.......of course this is a foolish idea. But who would be against "saving the world from all it's evils"??---someone without 'heart'.........lol    Conservatives on the other hand are more realistic in their approach to government. They understand you can't save the world from itself. What you can do is use your head and be an individual. Individuals tend to support limited federal govt., low taxes, and free market economics---in essence: more freedom (Thomas Jefferson etc.)    I'm also in my early 20s. If you haven't listened to Ron Paul talk about economics, I would definitely check him out on youtube. The media is currently painting any who opposes Obama "saving the country" (via his pork filled "recovery" plan) as obstructionist.    Stand strong. Conservatism is based in ideas. American liberalism (not to be confused with Classical Liberalism---Jefferson etc.) is based in ideals.|`|CgGVpUI5aa	Beautiful.

Most have mixed beliefs to some degree.  What really cements someone strongly to one side is most often just a knee-jerk acceptance of values in order to make one's self "part of the group".  Sort of like a pack instinct.

Anyhow, he used a variation of this quote.  If you are in your twenties and you are not FIGHTING the system, then you have no heart, if you are in your forties and STILL fighting the system, you have no brain.  I think in essence, it is saying that in youth is idealism, pragmatism and altruism.  However, as we age, our experiences tend to (not with everybody)...jade us a bit.  Some learn (or feel) that they CANNOT change the world, so why bother.  Sometimes the ride is smooth, so don't rock the boat.      I'm not condoning or promoting either outlook.  However, I think this variation of the saying better fits your question.  I think you are a mature individual that knows where you stand on certain issues.  Your question seems to request affirmation of this statement.  I won't affirm.  I think the first answerer said it best.  Basically, who am I to judge you?!  I must admit I like your style though.  Maybe you are a "classic liberal" in the 18th Century sense (Libertarian or whig might fit too).  Keep asking questions of yourself, your government and others.

Now that all the libs gave me thumbs up, I'm going to break it to you gently:    Pretending that the meat industry is cruel makes you a liberal.  Carnivores in nature are far more cruel than anything mankind has ever done.  When you protest mankind without a thought to the slaughters performed in nature, you demonstrate the one-sidedness of prejudice that only liberals are capable of.    Supporting Palestinians despite their crimes against humanity makes you a liberal.  You can never favor people who are saddists by choice unless you've sold your soul or you're just not informed.  The liberal media maintains the one-sided information that you have fallen victim to.  Only a liberal would refuse to expand their information sources beyond that which comforts them.  Time for you to grow up.    You may want to rethink these things based on reality rather than based on what the liberal media feeds you.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	He meant that most young people are idealistic.

The requirement to "Buy American" on stimulus funds is going to cause trade friction, which hurts free trade.  And will hurt the economy in the long run.  It's already upset some of our trading partners.    This is the same sort of thing that happened during the depression of the 1930's.  Trade barriers of the 30's are considered to be a major factor in causing the severity of that depression.|`|xkcLOfTKaa	Well, it is not a BAN.

That's fine if a country can produce everything itself. But there aren't many countries that are entirely self sufficient.    Especially when the liberal Democrats won't allow any form of energy production.|`|g8CsCKpGaa	It is a costly move.  If US steel were the cheapest available (which it isn't), then we would be ok.  Now the projects using US steel will cost more than ones that can go with the cheapest steel.  This means we won't be able to spend that money on other projects.  Additionally, the steel providers that lose our business won't make as much money.  Less money for them means that they will buy less things from America (and other countries), causing demand for our exports to drop.  This may cause American export companies to downsize due to less overseas business.|`|4160f1b362be1a382ff4fa170d98797caa	It seems reminiscent of the ban on oil sale to Japanese before Pearl Harbor.|`|d13c4c2bb60f93e106a5ef936fc63dc9aa	Solid move.    http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090131/ap_o...

It was a sober but inspirational speech about the work we have ahead of us and our inspirations and goals.     A lot of people have had a lot to say about it, but most of them didn't actually listen to it, and none of them seem to have read it. )|`|GkqTIGVqaa	I HATE AMERICA AND WHITE PEOPLE|`|12xBKdkqaa	He talked about how this will be a new chapter for America and we will lead a new era of peace.|`|DWR80bGfaa	My fellow citizens:    I stand here today humbled by the task before us, grateful for the trust you have bestowed, mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors. I thank President Bush for his service to our nation, as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition.    Forty-four Americans have now taken the presidential oath. The words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace. Yet, every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms. At these moments, America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because we the people have remained faithful to the ideals of our forebears, and true to our founding documents.    So it has been. So it must be with this generation of Americans.    That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood. Our nation is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred. Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age. Homes have been lost; jobs shed; businesses shuttered. Our health care is too costly; our schools fail too many; and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet.    These are the indicators of crisis, subject to data and statistics. Less measurable but no less profound is a sapping of confidence across our land  a nagging fear that America's decline is inevitable, and that the next generation must lower its sights.    Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real. They are serious and they are many. They will not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this, America  they will be met.    On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord.    On this day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn out dogmas, that for far too long have strangled our politics.    We remain a young nation, but in the words of Scripture, the time has come to set aside childish things. The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose our better history; to carry forward that precious gift, that noble idea, passed on from generation to generation: the God-given promise that all are equal, all are free and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness.    In reaffirming the greatness of our nation, we understand that greatness is never a given. It must be earned. Our journey has never been one of shortcuts or settling for less. It has not been the path for the faint-hearted  for those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame. Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things  some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor, who have carried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and freedom.    For us, they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life.    For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West; endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth.    For us, they fought and died, in places like Concord and Gettysburg; Normandy and Khe Sanh.    Time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life. They saw America as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions; greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction.    This is the journey we continue today. We remain the most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth. Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began. Our minds are no less inventive, our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year. Our capacity remains undiminished. But our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions  that time has surely passed. Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America.    For everywhere we look, there is work to be done. The state of the economy calls for action, bold and swift, and we will act  not only to create new jobs, but to lay a new foundation for growth. We will build the roads and bridges, the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together. We will restore science to its rightful place, and wield technology's wonders to raise health care's quality and lower its cost. We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories. And we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age. All this we can do. All this we will do.     Now, there are some who question the scale of our ambitions  who suggest that our system cannot tolerate|`|jxKQqbC9aa	yeah he pretty much talked about how much better he is than white ppl even though he is half white and he screwed up his oath maybe he planned that and tried to get away with it so he can stay his terrorist self|`|aOQZ2ZAOaa	it was amazing btw.  and you can get it off of itunes free if you want to hear it.|`|se8T6wEvaa	It was a snooze-fest.

It was written by some guy who's about 20-something years old.    Obama made a lot of snide references to how bad America is and how we're not very generous and have never done good things for the rest of the world ever before but now that he's the president, things will be better.  It was a real downer.  Made you feel bad about yourself and your country.  Obama took some nasty swipes at Bush without mentioning him by name - almost like he forgot that Bush was sitting right there - and he never even had the basic manners to thank Bush or even acknowledge him.  Pretty tacky.  The speech made us all sad and we were glad when he finally quit speaking.  A real downer.    You can find the speech somewhere on line I suppose.  It was mercifully short so you can read it for yourself and see if you can figure out if there was anything important in it.  Nobody seems to think that there was any memorable line in it.  He needs to find some more mature people to write his speeches.  It was really mediocre.
vFHXrOHNaa	No problems, I have been using passport for last three years with Misspelled Middle Name which completely makes my name stupid.    It takes about two weeks to have that corrected, all they will do is put a note on the last page, but since I travel so much almost every month a trip I do not have time to get that corrected.    Traveled with this misspelled passport to:    China, Japan, Vietnam, India, UAE, UK & Netherlands.    So do not worry go ahead with your plans. No need to spend time and money to correct this now, get it done next time around.    I will have to wait till 2015.    BTW: I am also signed up with the Global Entry Program with this mis-spelled passport.|`|ggpf6AZuaa	you need to get this taken care of ASAP, you will probably  have to pay something as you have no proof that you didnt mispell your name on the forms you submited when you first got your passport.

Theres this new thing that trys to keep kids out of going to court  Talk to your probation officer if you have one. But if they already have a court date your gunna have to pay that 300$.    My fine was 2000$|`|5JFUagrKaa	well if you have a court date, and your teacher knows your situation, just tell the court what actually happened. honestly, that's probably all that you can do. otherwise, you'll just have to pay $300|`|AA11865529	You are entitled to a lawyer.

When you go to court, make sure to mention the stuff you said above, except about the cops in your family.   You are young, you made a bad choice, you learned from this, your parents grounded you for a month and you have to stay home and do chores, etc.  Tell the judge you don't have $300.  Chances are if you have no record or any problems, a minor offense if usually tossed.    I'd be more curious about the cop who gave you a ticket for skipping school.|`|ABCJpMQoaa	Hi there, honestly I used to skip school a lot.  I never got caught but it put me way behind.  Usually if you do it once you will do it again.  If you are serious about not doing it ever again then explain this to your judge.  Ask if you can do some sort of community service hours such as volunteering at your school or something.  I am sure because you have such good grades and you have never done this before that they would the judge can see it in your eyes if you are trully sorry for what you did.  People make mistakes, but you learn from it.  Just make the right decision next time.  Ask the judge for some other type of punishment like I mentioned above.  I am sure that will be okay.  Dont worry about to much.  Just try to stay a good kid and do good in school.    Trish|`|rbMRoLfraa	Jimmy,    I'm in my 40's, and all I can say is that our society has become a nation of EXCESSIVE laws, largely because it is BIG BUSINESS for the legal system.    Don't get me wrong, Laws, rules, and guidelines are good and helpful to maintain an orderly society. BUT, somewhere in the last two decades this country became OBESSED with criminalizing as many of it's citizens that it can.    Jimmy, I don't condone ditching class,... but I certainly can't condemn it at the level of prosecution being levied against you.    If you were my son,  first, I would ground you and maybe take away some priveledge you earned.  Then I would tell you that I don't think you are a bad person for ditching class, because I understand that everyone feels the need to take an unscheluded break from their daily routine.  I would further explain that I'm very proud of all that you have acheived .     Next, I would want to know if there is some problem regarding the class (or classes) that you ditched.  AND, after all that is discussed, I would remind you that if it happens again, there will be more restrictions of priveledges, than this time.    Then,if I as your Father, I would accompany you to court and in a very respectful, but firm manner, I would question the courts' wisdom in dragging a 14yr.old into the "legal system" for cutting a class.    Jimmy, don't blame your Dad (or anyone else that may go with you) if they don't actually say those things in court.They're not allowed to, they will be held in contempt if they state their opinions,   regardless of how humble and respectfully they express them.    I want you to know that you are living in a great country, advanced in many ways, yet as a young person, you have the chance to help change the things wrong with this nation.   When you walk into court, you may find the justice system needs a serious updating in it's proceedings.     Society and human nature have become so complex, almost beyond description, yet, the American courts still feel that no matter how unique each person and situation is, everything can be reduced to 4 descriptive resolutions....YES, NO, GUILTY, NOT GUILTY.  Our courts believe everything is defintive. Though our society has grown far from being definitive.   I would never have thought that we, the people, would out grow the wisdom of our justice and legal system .   These might be topics for your teachers to discuss in class.    Let me sum it up for you Jimmy;  When you go to court, if your Dad or Mom or Any other adult subsitute, whom may accompany you,  does not say much on your behalf, do not be disappointed. They just aren't allowed to (unless the Judge directly asks them)  When you speak to the Judge, show him all the respect that his position deserves.  Stand up when he walks into the court, then be seated when instructed to.  Address the the Judge as "Your Honor" when he speaks to you. ex. "Yes, Your Honor" or no Your Honor"  Give very direct answers, (no excuses, such as "yes, BUT")   Don't fidget, keep your eye contact with the Judge when he speaks to you, or you to him.  Don't fear him, but respect him (or her, sorry, I forgot to mention there are alot of woman judges)   Our justice/legal system itself may be robotic, cold and outdated, but the fortunate thing is that Judges are people too and most of them are fair minded.  I think you will do okay.  If the Judge reduces the charges or lets you off with a warning, remember to say "Thank You your Honor" very sincerely....BUT...if he requests you pay the full amount....still remember to be polite and respectiveful....as you exit the court.    Okay, young fellow,  follow that code of behaviour and you will do fine.  I have a feeling the Judge will give you some kind of a break.  They're really not bad people out to hurt someone for an infraction as minor as yours. (considering all the real evil that can be found in every corner of the earth)   It's the "SYSTEM" that needs correcting.    When I was in school, we had Truant officers that drove around town and if they caught you off school grounds they would bring you to the police station, call one of your parents to pick you up  The punishiment was given to you by your parents and the school.  ex. school detention or suspension.  the court never got involve, unless you were a habitual truant.    When I went to school, at least 75% of the kids had cut at least 1 class each year.   Some of the people I know who cut class enough, not able to be counted, are very successful people today!  Again, I'm not saying you should cut class, but it doesn't warrant the drama they are putting you through!    Quite frankly Jimmy, it sounds like you are living in a Nazi Township!    I have a college degree, many classes in Pyschology, I can definately say that the Authorities/Adults in your town are exhibiting unhealthy, fear mongering, manipulative behaviour towards the youth in your town.    Honestly, I think the "Town Council" is just looking for ways to fatten
AA11494150	Yes, they may.    In order to stop a car, an officer needs a reasonable suspicion there is a violation of the law. That violation does not have to be traffic related, it only needs to be reasonable. Seeing a person that appears underage after curfew would be reasonable.|`|AA10925759	For one no matter what you think you are not an experienced driver so you might do something that raises suspicion. They is a thing where driving super duper carefully or at a low speed can catch an officers eye.    There is the curfew thing. Reason enough to pull you over.    At whatever age it is possible that someone could hit you because they are lousy drivers. The insurance will not pay for your car or any damages to the other car. A minor bump could cost tens of thousands. Explain that one to your parents.     And if caught they can deny you from getting a license for years if you get stopped. I don't suppose the trip is worth all of that risk.|`|vuzi75iiaa	heck yes they will pull you over, dont do it! ride your bike|`|ztijFfNXaa	'Will' a cop pull you over at 1am in the morning? There's a better than average chance if you have to ask. I wouldn't do it if I were you, especially if your community has a curfew.     'Can' a police officer pull you over if you look too young to drive, the answer is yes.    "Nothing good ever happens on the street after 10pm"|`|OVPmcpL1aa	Well, you won't get pulled over if you are not driving suspiciously and breaking the law.    But i encourage you not to do it. Even if you were careful and other car hits you, you will be in trouble.     And you won't be able to obtain your license until the age of 21.    So DON'T DO IT.|`|AA11727779	Sure..go ahead..its real smart to risk it. I mean you could get into an accident and whoops. you do not have a drivers license nor are you covered by any kind of auto ins. than your brother will have to be the one liable.

zejFr1Ciaa	Supposedly it already is unfortunately we don't enforce it.|`|MEReSvZeaa	In the US, it is.    The first time I ever tried to sponsor an immigrant was from Brazil, and the Office of Immigration gave me the list of priorities for people seeking immediate citizenship or assylum.  Everything on the list suggested that the US would take ONLY highly accomplished or high-profile people (including athletes and artists).    Having said that, anyone can immigrate if they have a sponsor and don't mind the waiting period.    The second person I tried to sponsor (my wife) was a nobody.  I got her here simply because I was willing to be responsible for her.  (She did get preferential treatment because I was in the military, though.)
AA11579568	I don't think so. I don't think the government should be involved in anything but a standing military. People need to look after themselves, they shouldn't rely on anyone else.|`|MEReSvZeaa	Not the American government.    FDR did make some expansions of government into private enterprise in the 30s, if I remember, and in time, the government divested of all of them.  Now we're doing it again under Bush and Obama.|`|qZXIm3Ksaa	in a recession, YES. That's how the U.S. got out the great depression, sometimes it is necessary for the well-being of ALL citizens and the economy.|`|jj4ZbtrCaa	no the government should not touch the private sector. That is why we have a market economy not a command economy, which seems to be the way we are heading with Obama.|`|AA10722427	If a country is in a crisis, well then yes. Also, I think that before a country can become truly capitalist, a government needs to control some aspects of business first, so they can't let them get away with anything, like they do today. If they can do that, then a government can stop controlling the economy directly (owning business).

You will apply independently. From what I've gathered, you are not a on a conditional green card anymore and have been living in the US for at least 5 years? If you haven't taken any trips outside the US for 6 months or more at a time during the last 5 years, you can apply for naturalization.<br>  <br>  Some weeks ago, a lady posted a message on here saying that she applied after 3 years but she got denied because she was getting divorced and she was told she has to fulfill the 5-year residency requirement in that case. This applies to you too. Once your case gets denied, you will have to file all the paperwork again along with the fees so be aware of these rules.
NvsFhD7Laa	You need to look at the court records.  Go to the courthouse where the legal action was filed and pull up your case.  You can also try to look online.  But if it was a long time ago, you may actually have to go to the courthouse.<br>  <br>  That will give you the information for the lawyers for the insurance company or the other side, whoever it was.  <br>  <br>  Be prepared though, you may find that the money is gone, because the account was never set up.<br>  <br>  If there was no court case, then you can contact the insurance company as well.  They will have records of it.  <br>  <br>  Bottom line is that if there was any significant amount of money, there will be paperwork reflecting that somewhere.  And someone else will have paperwork besides your mom and the attorney.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|MOALBorJaa	If you were under 18 and it was a significant amount of money, then the odds are fairly good that the settlement had to have been approved by a judge, most likely in a closed proceeding.

AA11206283	It's a straw man transaction. If the property was used to secure a note BEFORE the deed to you, the mortgage is still in first lien position, and the lender has the right to foreclose on the borrower.  You own 1/2 interest; but you got it subject to the outstanding liens and encumberances of record; including that mortgage. <br>  <br>  It is possible your son violated "Due on sale/transfer" clauses in the mortgage by doing a transfer; only a lawyer reviewing the mortgage could tell you that; in which case, the whole thing is due and payable in 30 days in most cases.<br>  Both signed the note; both are responsible. <br>  <br>  partition suit; judge will order one party or the other to buy out and refi- or sell and pay off.<br>  <br>  Suggestion? Have the divorce decree address the status of the house and order it sold to release debt. Should save you a partition suit;|`|xdlsGvldaa	The person or persons who's name is on the mortgage is the responsible party(s) for the payments.

I propose a streaming tickertape index, similar to the familiar fraction-based line which appears at the bottom of many news broadcasts. It would display an ever-changing poverty index, unemployment index, hunger index, homelessness index, illiteracy index, educational index and healthcare and medical coverage index.     We might even create a consortium of indices which reflect the overall state of the people. We could call it "The Standards of the Poor." A wonderful vision might be the market cheering at the end of the day, traders being proud of their hard work of staffing telephones, yelling at each other, satisfied as the closing bells tolls, that their day's labor has lead to the biggest drop in the homelessness index in US history! Imagine.    Economists cant tell misery from well-being, only more from less. A society should be judged not on how the wealthy are doing but rather how the poor and the dispossessed are faring. A society is, after all, only as good as the condition of the worst of the lot within its midst.|`|qhdhva5Daa	I pay taxes.

The CONservatives think that it is their country alone, they can say or do whatever they want to do it with no moral or boundaries. They are pro-choice, but they would love to go to wars.   The liberals have their share of the burden too. They liberals think that abortion to any from or format should be legal. That's just not right. I do not want my tax dollar to help a pregnant woman abort her child just because she feels like it. Because she has to go to school or some other stupid stuff. If the pregnant would endanger the mother, then it would be wise, IF the mother want to abort. However, most abortions are done because the mother or/and father did not want to have the baby for any reason whatsoever.|`|09neUq82aa	People don't have a sense of entitlement.    They have a sense of needing to feed their families.       The people on the dole aren't lazy. They're either disabled or exploited.        This is the way America works. The people who work the hardest (that's policemen, miners, firemen, carpenters, lumberjacks, garbagemen, factory workers, etc.) earn the least, while the people who work the least earn the most (that's bankers, share-holders, IT Consultants, Hotel Chain Owners, Restaraunt managers, etc.).    I'm not advocating revolution, I'm just saying that us with the easy jobs and abundant pay shouldn't be so quick to accuse others of laziness.|`|BImIMnbzaa	What entitlement is it, I ask?  Is asking for unemployment compensation too much to ask for, while the scum on Wall St hands out $18 billion to the anointed few ?    Perhaps it's the $150 million for parties in Washington DC, while Americans freeze to death because utility company's shuts off energy needed to survive.    I know, it's the people who have seen their lives do a 180, in just a few short weeks.  People who had made New Year's resolutions to improve their lives, and now wonder where their next meal is coming from.  Are those the people you refer to, the audacity to wonder about their next meal ?

809fe92a5e8a388fd9915476812d008caa	In a nutshell it depends on demographics. Certain groups of people are more likely to vote for one party or the other--for example rich people tend to vote for Republicans because Republicans promise to cut taxes, minorities tend to vote for Democrats because Democrats support civil rights legislation, and so on. In general urban areas tend to vote Democratic and rural areas are conservative (with suburbs a bit of a tossup region) and states with a disproportionate amount of their population in big cities--New York, California--tend to be very liberal, while states without major cities--Wyoming, Alaska--tend to vote conservaitve.|`|um87XJvmaa	Silliness.

People that live in cities tend to rely on the government to do things for them... public transportation, trash pick up, public arenas and museums, etc. These people vote liberal because they want the government to do more and more and provide more and more. People that live in rural areas tend to be more conservative and are called "red" states. These people thrive on a "I provide for my own needs" mentality and don't want the government involved. Neighbors and family look after each other and hard work is the answer to problems, not the government.|`|C7CaNLGlaa	I don't think it will matter much soon.

Some electricians are doing this in sub freezing temps right now.)|`|cWyQc7T7aa	That's hard to say.      Hard work isn't necessarily due to the job you have.  It's more due to how well you do the job you have.|`|FmEsMOKVaa	depends on the person. There are lazy people on both sides.|`|AA11598520	Can't really answer that.

IUXriZQJaa	yes    Look at CNN's coverage of the "collapse" of the Soviet empire.  They bought, hook, line and sinker, the story of the helicopter pilot who was ferrying Spetznaz troops to take the Kremlin and refused to take them there . . . Spetznaz would have killed him and flown the chopper themselves.    Look at their coverage of the abortion issue. 90 hours for pro-aborts, with lots of positive notes, but only negative articles on those who oppose abortionl.    Same with Gun control, Democrat candidates (especially Obama), euthanasia, Israel, and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.    When the Gulf War started, each day CNN had us at a point of surrender while Fox News was telling the real story.     If you are a left winger, you can get all the air time you want, but if not, 2 minutes is the most, and they get to pick the questions.    Let me point out Terri Schiavo, who suffered a collapse (most likely from spousal abuse) and lay in *HOSPICE* for over a decade (hospice is only for the dying), was denied routine medical care and had an estranged husband who went around asking eagerly if she was dead yet while he made plans with his live-in girlfriend and the family he hoped to build with her.    CNN Gave him nothing but positive press, while Terri's video of her responding clearly to the doctor was not shown. They made no effort to investigate the facts. Now the attorney general who refused to allow an investigation into how she got there is governor.    Try and tell me that media coverage is not something which should be held accountable.|`|Hxttt7G0aa	Absolutely. It's not so much the liberal thing that bothers me though. It's that they have to misrepresent and outright lie to support their ideology. What they show around the world is even worse. I've spent a lot of time in hotel rooms around the world watching those scum bags misrepresent.|`|0s09peMQaa	They are kind of the jerry springer of news.|`|spuz7DvNaa	CNN is far too liberal (except Lou Dobbs) but not the most liberal.

It's far too corporate and obviously supports corporate interests.  Wolf Blitzer is corporate center right. They have basically the same pundits talking all the time and most of them are from the RNC or corporate media.  Lou Dobbs certainly is NOT liberal, he's an GOP conservative trying to pull the wool over everyone's eyes by saying he's an independent.  If you want liberal or progressive, watch MSNBC's Olberman and Maddow.  And, if you want a good source for Progressive news listen to Amy Goodman who can also be seen on Direct T.V and Dish.  She has great interviews with people who are professionals in their fields including conservative, liberal, progressive and centrists.  Bill Moyers on PBS is liberal but he has people who are conservative on his show as well.  He has fantastic high quality interviews too.  And, they don't yell at you or talk down to the audience.  They go way beyond the talking points and analyze the facts in depth.  They are far more mature than the screaming ditto heads out there on AM radio.    BTW, Ted Turner no longer has anything to do with CNN.  Once Time Warner took over the company back in the 1980's it became very corporate and conservative.  They gave Turner a tiny office and told him to basically shut up.  He resigned back in the 90's and now has nothing to do with it. CNN is no longer liberal and wasn't really that liberal to begin with.    BTW, to the answer above, I watch CSPAN 1 and 2, I don't find right wing FOX or CNN to be accurate at all in terms of telling what is really going on.  Anyone who thinks Hannity, Calvuto, O'reilly or Beck tell anything of the truth is not paying attention to the facts.|`|bIOf9lv7aa	LOL.. Does anyone care?  According to the ratings, not many people watch it, or MSNBC. They have the lowest ratings of ANY program...Even lower than the cooking shows.|`|nIu8zVkXaa	Yes, but PMSNBC has CNN beat hands down with liberality.  Keith Olberman is an absolute raving lunatic from hell.  I don't know how he keeps his job.  Oh yeah, I forgot.  He's an Obama apologist.|`|qEp9fxU9aa	I don't know it's close.  CBS has been found guilty of forgery to attack Republicans.  The Boston Globe and New York Times have also been found guilty of fraud to attack Republicans.  CNN is extremely liberal though it's not very far off of CBS, NBC, ABC, PBS & MSNBC.  For anyone that doesn't believe me please watch C-SPAN some day where there is a big issue being debated then watch all of the news stations that evening you will will see for yourself who used sound bites out of context and slants the days news.  I do this about once every 6 months and FOX News is the only one that acurately portrays the days events.  I didn't believe there was media bias and had never seen FOX News when I accidentily did this.
VIhj7ghUaa	I don't know.  I'd like to jump up and down on it to see how long it takes to break it once and for all.  One conservative party is bad enough.  We don't need two.|`|qEp9fxU9aa	More people aren't jumping on the Republican bandwagon because they share a your similar lack of knowledge and ability to think past a sound bite.  Republican George W. Bush had a far lower deficit as a percentage of GDP than Clinton and this was while protecting our country from terrorists.  Most Republican's despise all earmarks though sadly this isn't 100% of them.  Even sadder I know of no Democrats that have ever found a pork bill or earmark they didn't like.  Due to the fact that Rush Limbaugh got addicted to pain killers while he was having medical problems doesn't have anything to do with the Republican Party.  That's like saying since Bernie Ward, the king of Democrat Talk Radio, was convicted of Child Pornography and assault of minors that all Democrats are pedifiles.  That's just wrong.|`|5Ho518J9aa	That's why there's a difference between a Conservative and a NeoCon. Conservatives stand on Common Sense, while NeoCons are actually Fabian Socialists who've hijacked the Republican Party. Fear not, folks, the Democratic Party isn't any better. Your Party was hijacked by the Fabian Socialists too. What do you think Nancy Pelosi is, one of the good old blue-dog democrats that were fiscally conservative, but stuck up for the working man? Nope. They're gone, with the exception of Dennis Kucinich, but he's actually a Libertarian. The only decent Republican is Dr. Ron Paul, but he's actually a Libertarian. Hmm...|`|I6dcRgD6aa	85% of the country is supporting Obama. That doesn't mean that a lot of them are not feelling more fear than faith but it doesn't mean they have jumped ship with the repubs.

I mean they lie to the people & give polls that are not accurate.

Here's what he REALLY says:    SERVICE  "Your own story and the American story are not separate -- they are shared. And they will both be enriched if we stand up together, and answer a new call to service to meet the challenges of our new century  I won't just ask for your vote as a candidate; I will ask for your service and your active citizenship when I am president of the United States. This will not be a call issued in one speech or program; this will be a cause of my presidency."  -- Barack Obama, Speech in Mt. Vernon, IA  December 5, 2007    President Obama began his career on the South Side of Chicago, working with a coalition of churches to improve living conditions in poor neighborhoods. During the election, people all across the country talked about feeling a new sense of civic engagement and got involved in politics for the first time. Now, President Obama and Vice President Biden are counting on Americans from all walks of life to serve the nation and help address the problems we face -- and they're committed to building the infrastructure and providing the resources that will make it possible.    Enable All Americans to Serve to Meet the Nation's Challenges    Expand Corporation for National and Community Service: Expand AmeriCorps from 75,000 slots to 250,000 and focus this expansion on addressing the great challenges facing the nation -- helping teachers and students in underserved schools; improving public health outreach; weatherizing homes and launching renewable energy projects; assisting veterans; and helping communities plan, prepare for and respond to emergencies.    Engage Retiring Americans in Service on a Large Scale: Expand and improve programs that connect individuals over the age of 55 to quality volunteer opportunities.    Expand the Peace Corps: Double the Peace Corps to 16,000 by 2011. Build an international network of overseas volunteers so that Americans work side-by-side with volunteers from other countries.    Show the World the Best Face of America: Set up an America's Voice Initiative to deploy Americans who are fluent speakers of local languages for public diplomacy. Extend opportunities for older individuals such as teachers, engineers, and doctors to serve overseas.    Integrate Service into Learning    Expand Service-Learning in Our Nation's Schools: Set a goal that all middle and high school students do 50 hours of community service a year. Develop national guidelines for service learning and give schools better tools both to develop programs and to document student experience.    Expand Youth Programs: Create an energy-focused youth jobs program to provide disadvantaged youth with service opportunities weatherizing buildings and getting practical experience in fast-growing career fields. Expand the YouthBuild program to give 50,000 disadvantaged young people the chance to complete their high school education, learn valuable skills and build affordable housing in their communities.    Require 100 Hours of Service in College: Establish a new American Opportunity Tax Credit worth $4,000 a year in exchange for 100 hours of public service a year.    Promote College Serve-Study: Ensure that at least 25 percent of College Work-Study funds are used to support public service opportunities instead of jobs in dining halls and libraries.    Invest in the Nonprofit Sector    Create a Social Investment Fund Network: Use federal seed money to leverage private sector funding to improve local innovation, test the impact of new ideas, and expand successful programs to scale.    Social Entrepreneurship Agency for Nonprofits: Create an agency within the Corporation for National and Community Service dedicated to building the capacity and effectiveness of the nonprofit sector.|`|N5jBMjrDaa	No, it should not be mandatory.  It would not be a bad thing to do, but you cannot instill a sense of civic responsibility by making people do things.|`|WvTbmSV3aa	No, it should not be mandatory. It is a waste of taxpayers money.|`|Xk8AzsMmaa	no one in america should be pledged to the president, they should be pledged to the consitution    children should not be invoved at all...hey this reminds me of something...now what was it?...oh yeah, Hitler    http://www.infowars.com/obamas-hitler-oa...    here's a link for the other side of the story to your link|`|AA11210239	Not my child.  There WOULD be a gunfight.|`|zrthZOCdaa	Didnt the Nazi's have a Hitler Youth organization?|`|mC4mnvGFaa	apparently, someone admires the nazi regime.  I don't think Obama will force youth to become civil servants. that would put milllions out of work|`|gGTk0hkVaa	Yeah like nazi brown shirts ....Not NO BUT H $  NO|`|KvbJM5bLaa	Your link is a  crackpot professor at a 3rd rate college. Not happening, although a voluntary program could have merit.|`|18a5d7e369330da3a47ede67c6e1e096aa	If you read the report, its not as if any children would be sent off to a boot camp and be brainwashed into following any government order. Rather, they would have the chance to grow as individuals through serving others. The authors point is American youth should learn the virtues of serving. While doing so, they would learn very valuable real-world skills.    This is NOT a new idea and has been used successfully. University students in Germany have to do something very similar. I am currently studying in Europe and very one of the German students I have spoken with has loved their program. They have learned 2nd or 3rd languages, studied real-world engineering problems, or contributed to civil causes.     This would be a win-win in a lot of ways. Our students would be more mature and grounded before going to school giving them a better chance of success they got there. Also, it would make it a University Education much more affordable to many students. This is not anything like Nazi propaganda of 10 year old children.

Many of us who heard of Obama before 2008* realize re-creating the SA is a dream he's articulated many times.    *Yes, children, he already existed. He did NOT supernaturally descend to mortal existence among us just in time to be President.|`|m1HVh5YUaa	I have already heard a few people defend Obama's plan to make 6th-12th graders work 2 hours a week for free until they are ready to graduate in order to actually receive a diploma. He even said the way to "encourage" this was by withholding federal funding if the schools do not participate. That little gem about funding I believe has been removed from his website. He also said that becoming a good citizen was as important to learn as math and science. [cringe]    Anyway, my point is that some are already defending it via their defense of their religious zealotry for this man, so who knows? It's hard for humans to admit being THAT wrong. Imagine how the Germans felt and how much denial was floating around that country.|`|4a4795e43d693be3aa7146aa0989ea2daa	Should'nt this be called USAMCC instead?

The only good thing that I can see coming out something like this is increased physical fitness, what with the marching and drills, pushups, bivoacs, running obstacle  courses and calisthenics among the youth in the schools.    This is not the future that the founding fathers dreamed of.|`|KAKXZw0Qaa	Republicans  get paranoid about every thing . Why are you worried about this ?

All he needs to do is offer a stimulus check again with no intentions of ever paying.  That's what he did to get elected and now refuses to pay.  Every voter thought they were getting $1100.00 didn't you?|`|MBFeHS22aa	America is going to turn on Obama anyhow. The way he is going it will be soon!|`|lRmhwiYpaa	Only if it is not CO_ED  but yes in reality most people don't want to be forced to do anything|`|N5jBMjrDaa	Possibly. If this were to actually happen, its just speculation at this time.  I would rather my children volunteer for service instead of being forced into it.  I don't think that people would give their all if they are being forced into it.  It would backfire.  You would have people giving the minimum to get by and that is all.

So while he made have made everyone feel good by bashing big bad wall street, the huge majority of the people that he bashed were just regular, middle America, hard working people.    but then that wouldn't distract from his cabinet atrocities or bad financial plans would it?|`|BQdXnCcHaa	No, I don't agree with Washington telling you how much money you can earn.    If they broke the law, arrest them. Bad decisions are not illegal. If they were, you'd be in prison right now.    Oh, and so you know, the vast majority of Americans are stockholders.

And, yes, he should have reprimanded them. And Giuliani needs to shut up. It's the greed and graft on Wall St. that caused the collapse, and yet some people are still deluded enough to claim that not only is it ok for them to have bonuses, but that Obama shouldn't interfere? Are you NUTS?!  TARP wasn't designed to save Wall St. workers, it was designed to save the banks from collapse and to put the liquidity back into the market. TARP was never about Wall St. employees, it was about unfreezing credit lines so that banks could loan tax payer money BACK TO TAX PAYERS in the form of credit cards, school loans, morgages and personal loans! It was never to fund private jets, spa days and bonuses for the very people who ran it into the ground in the first place!|`|KAKXZw0Qaa	I doubt it .|`|5YTkGB5yaa	Yeah talk is cheap. I'll believe it when I see some action.|`|4zKmOkI4aa	reprimand? that would mean some kind of punishment? what was that? and the stimulus already had protections for them in it.so obama can't do a freakin thing.wake up! geesh you guys drive me crazy!|`|AA11313983	I'm not a republican, but I don't agree with his reprimand.  I do disagree with Obama's vote to give them the money they used to give the bonuses.  He seems to have forgotten that piece of the puzzle.    How can you give someone money with no stipulations, and then get mad at them for using it?
evFXsDvdaa	The best thing would be to stock up now before the invasion. I suggest buying all the ammunition you can and possibly pick up some more small caliber handguns and rifles.     Once you have done that you will need to find a suitable location to bury them. You will need some sort of vessel to contain them. Now it is time to bury them. Make sure its somewhere where the ground isnt to wet or where someone else might dig them up.     This step is key. Once the hole is dug make sure to cover your vessel in a thick layer of saran wrap completely. This will help make it watertight. After it is wrapped. Completely cover it in duct tape. This will add to the durability and help to keep dirt and water out as well. Once this is complete bury the vessel.     a good way to remember where you buried the guns and ammunition is to either put a large landscaping rock on top or have a drawn map somewhere secret that only you would know at your house.     Finally, wait for the invasion! Lets see those democrat bastards take your ammo!|`|1amF7oNwaa	THE FAR LEFT DO|`|9da72d062dc6b218c4c910a4230c1819aa	Not all Democrats but the liberal ones (which is most of the leadership) wants to.|`|AA11210239	Many do.

The gov't is going to have alot of problems with these new laws...us "rednecks" don't give them up easily!!|`|3QELIOU7aa	They can try all they want to take guns and ammo.  I don't think the result would be very pretty.|`|Asmp8nkFaa	I guess they believe that criminals will follow this and any other asinine law they propose. Laws are only followed by honest citizens.  This type of law only opens up another gray or black market producing inferior products that will be inherently more dangerous.   Gun control does not work, teaching responsibility and proper use will prevent far more issues.    Just look at news articles, President Obama is mentioned as anti-gun and the sales of fire arms has taken off, now the ammunition will follow.

You may also want to notify the Social Security Administration that your number is being used fraudulently. <br>  <br>  Do not though go to the employer yourself. This could lead to the culprits being tipped off and fleeing.

There was a story about a guy in S. Carolina who had a guy do the same thing to him for years, and he ended up owing hundreds of thousands of dollars which the gov made him pay! You need to report this asap to the police and to the company that sent you the w-2 and to whoever else will listen. I hope you reported the theft when it happened.

Even without immigrants this place would still be bad one if you ask me. The answer is, im afraid, not a lot, because it seems that all the parties that are running for election are incapable of turning things around. An overhaul of the entire political & legal system is what is really needed, but the working classes has no forms of organised resistence any more, the unions are almost completely dead and buried having been emasculated by Thatcher and their powers have been run down even more by this Government.

I have considered a lot of the information that has presented itself and it was a waste of my time.<br>  War has never been a strong point for democrats. Today democrats are willing to declare war on anything that can't fight back. The war on big tobacco, war on poverty, war on those who rape the environment, war on hunger, war on unborn and unwanted children and presumably the French. <br>  One more time; Weapons of mass destruction includes nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. Concluding the absence of nuclear weapons was in itself reason to call the war unjustified is a farce! Those of you who might have been in a comma after the start of the war might still remember the attack on the Iraqi Kurd villages where Saddam ordered the deployment of nerve gas indiscriminately over villages causing grizzly deaths of thousands of women and children. <br>  Using Google and typing in “The bomb in my garden” produces books written about a guy named Mahdi Obeidi, a gifted Iraqi scientist schooled in the United States where he earned a master's degree in refinery engineering and after his return, joined Iraq's Atomic Energy Commission. Saddam Hussein seized power in 1979 and Iraq pushed more aggressively with its nuclear program. A French reactor purchased by Iraq was nearly complete when in 1981, eight Israeli F-16 fighter jets bombed and destroyed the reactor but this was not the end of Iraq's quest. In the years that followed Saddam moved his nuclear ambitions underground where the program relied on a process using a gas centrifuge to enrich uranium. Within 18 months, Obeidi had created what he calls ''very likely the most efficient covert enrichment program in history.'' The program was suspended indefinitely after coalition forces entered Iraq in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Fearing materials could uncover Iraq's nuclear intents; the equipment was disassembled, buried or destroyed successfully while the designs were buried in the garden of Dr Obeidi for possible future use. As close as they had come, Iraq would never get as close as they were to building a nuclear weapon because after their defeat, the manpower intensive program would almost certainly had been discovered by UN weapons inspectors. Could it be that Saddam's ejecting of UN weapon inspectors been for the purpose of re instituting his WMD program? <br>  Who among us knew for certain whether or not Iraq had built a nuclear weapon? Dissenting political opponents acted as if somehow they knew for sure that Iraq was not in possession of a nuclear weapon yet who offered to tell us what we've just learned? The correct answer is no one did. I for one am happy Bush aired on the side of caution yet not one stinking politician on either side knew for certain but democrats imparticular, spoke as if they did when they didn't. Any other answer is speculation, a best guess, a game to manipulate those who depend on our leaders to be strait and honest with us. It's a crime! This is the conspiracy and both dems and reps should be pissed off about it. <br>  <br>  Now what sounds more creditable? The hogwash about the Israeli’s manipulating the United States, the World Trade Center was imploded intentionally and 19 Arabs killed themselves for Bush? <br>  <br>  Please!?!<br>  The conspiracies who argue the earth is flat and we never landed on the moon have more credibility than the 9/11 pinheads.

rOWMQuVVaa	No - the truth is out there - people don't care.   <br>  <br>  You've seen this time and time again.   A democrat has an affair and "the country" is up in arms.   A republican has an affair and you hear it once and it passes.   It is traditionally the conservatives who rally people up - but they are all war supporters.  Sure, there are many liberals who disagree with war - but they already know they just don't spit on people or beat people up.<br>  <br>  (If they spit on people and beat people up they would probably be war supporters too . . hehehehe)|`|ZB3cWcVXaa	Are you asking "if they told the truth" or "if they continued to lie in favor your point of view"?  The truth would certainly not result in any beating of Bush supporters - it would just make more Bush supporters.  Soldiers would be praised.  The continuation of lies would still not have that effect - nothing would change.<br>  <br>  The war in Iraq isn't even really a "war".  Our troops are basically serving as a temporary police force until the Iraqi government can take care of that itself.  More people are murdered in Detroit in a month than Soldiers killed in Iraq in a month.  We have troops in way more places than just Iraq, too.

All that "spreading democracy, freedom, and getting rid of cruel dictators" is a bunch of bs that tries to justify USA imperialism/state sponsored terrorism/neo-colonialism.     Amerikkka.|`|BUGuJIk9aa	Amerikkka helping?? No ****** way. The US has caused too much death and destruction under the guise of liberation.
psVvOm54aa	This is nothing new for this elections.It is amusing to note that the Central govt is wasting Crores of tax payer money to advertise its achievements,but as a matter of fact the claims should be visible on the ground level for a commoner to see.People are well educated now a days to be taken in by these back door methods to garner votes.No the NGOs will not do anything because they too are partly funded by govt or its member, remember the now CEC Chawla running an NGO for congress? And media will not support the withdrawal of the ads because this the time for them to fill their kitty.So that leaves you and me and the like minded to think and vote.|`|USz2DSSUaa	now samuel reddy has launched a news channel too.|`|GllB4mPZaa	Agreed.|`|AFqZEOlRaa	Joe C. obviously didn't notice the word "India" in your question.  I'm not sure I understand the situation as you describe it, but if the ads are being paid for by the government, that's definitely a no-no here.

8454b08cd94e39ec6f1c2eb2f2b07a68aa	How can anyone who gets a 25 on their ASVAB go in as an E3? Are you trying to get a laugh out of us?<br>  <br>  EDIT* So, you got rank just because of referrals to the Army?|`|92jr44kFaa	Not a chance.<br>  <br>  You're still a private, and you're going to be able to get much out of that rank.<br>  <br>  However, there's a chance that you might be given a squad leader or Platoon guide position.  But don't think for a minute that it's going to be the fun of ordering people around.  Leadership in Basic Training consists of double checking every single thing your Soldiers do, and getting yelled at for each of their mistakes.   Did someone forget to lock their locker?  It's YOUR AS S!  one guy didn't make his bed correctly?  YOUR AS S, too!  Don't expect a promotion in basic.  Maybe in AIT, if you hustle your tail off.  You're not going to hit E-5 for a few years.|`|dMcpULcdaa	In basic training although there is different ranks, you will not be bossing around other people unless you are a platoon guide or a  squad leader. And you may be bossed around by an E-1 and there will be nothing you can do about it. To the DS you are a private and that is it.  <br>  <br>  Being an E-4 in Basic training. You won't get promoted to an -4 in basic but sometimes you will see soldiers that already have the E-4 pay grade prior to going to basic training. This is usually because they were prior service from the Airforce, coastguard, ect|`|9d9b8b9e4972c1f3e7d9b9e80936b200aa	lol, you're gonna get reamed at basic, by your DS and everybody else.<br>  <br>  <br>  No you can't make e-4 before you graduate boot camp, there is a time period and you have to qualify for promotion|`|UHBbSeesaa	First of all dude you have the wrong mentality!<br>  Did you really get a 25 on the asvab?!   your 11xray I bet.<br>  But,  I also entered as a PFC, I was a corporal out of AIT.  It was not easy and alot the fun was lost but it can be done!   Just don't let your marks follow you around.  your still a turd! your one of us all! its a team!<br>  If I could go back I would have done it different cause I didn't make the comradery the other guys did. I was a dik.<br>  Its better now, I ship back in 4-8 days and am looking foward to it.|`|KvTGiR6taa	ive heard of goin in as an e 2 but not an e 3.. but in any condition there is not way in hell you will be and e5 and its very very unlikley you would ever get e4 before graduating. as far as bossing anyone around..u are obviously clueless as to what bct is like. you wont be the one giving any orders to anyone.. you will be taking them is all|`|GXilXsghaa	My son entered basic as a E-3, no college, scored a 84 on his ASVAB. Enlisted for 5 years with the 18X contract. And he does get to wear his E-3 rank while in basic and he is a squad leader. He graduates OSUT in March.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	You are going to be the best soldier ever.  Seriously though, shouldn't you be in school?<br>  <br>  Yeah, I'm with Cecilia... didn't you say you rolled a 25 on the ASVAB?  Your command of the english language leads me to think you're around 14.|`|ypSp9ieKaa	no you will not graduate as an e-4 you wont even be an e-3 till you graduate. then you have to wait 6 months until your eligible for another promotion|`|GqTSa85daa	Ah, middle management...Alligators below and eagles above all getting after you.  Enjoy, soon to be Private First Class.|`|4pZxnpVkaa	I can't even begin to state how scary it is to think of you with a weapon in your hand.  Good lord.|`|vwOcFXgcaa	OMG here we go again. Seriously, you're just on here trolling, right? No one is as ignorant as you are, without being mildly retarded. <br>  <br>  1st: Even if you could get your own POW (personally owned weapon) into a combat theater, as soon as they found it on you, or you used it against someone, you would spend a majority of your adult life in a military prison. (The one in Kansas) <br>  <br>  2nd: Yes, it is possible to get E-3 for getting other people to join. We call it "Buddy F**ker" rank. Though, you can't wear it until you graduate. However, I think that by your mentality, you'll lose it anyway so don't worry about buying any rank.<br>  <br>  3rd: Boss someone around in Basic and see what happens. You will hate your life and they will set you up for failure and you will end up washed out. You are what's known as an Entry Level Discharge.<br>  You're recruiter has used you, fed you bull and sent you to fail. But once you step on the plane/bus/train to ship to basic, you are no longer his problem and he gets credit. No matter how much your life is about to suck and how much pain you are about to put yourself through. Hahaha, I don't blame him though, I've done it. <br>  <br>   Do me a favor, when you get to basic, before they f*** you up and send you back home to your momma, tell the Drill Sergeant you are going to be a Ranger. That should be good for about two hours of them humiliating you and smoking you. I wish I was still on Benning, I'd go to Sand Hill just to see them destroy you. <br>  <br>  Also, when they kick you out, because I do see that happening, DO NOT come back to Y!A and ask anyone s*** about the military. You are disgracing the 4500+ military members who have not come home from Iraq alive by thinking this is fun, games, and not as serious as it really is.<br>  <br>   If I was your dad I would seriously stomp a mudhole in your chest for dishonoring EVERYONE who has ever served by the s*** you say here. You're not misinformed, you are ignorant. But the drill sergeants will fix that. . . or send you home broken. I hope its the latter.<br>  <br>    Oh and I myself am a Noncomissioned Officer in the US Army. I know what I am talking about and I have several tours under my belt, just like some of the other military members (and spouses of other people) who answer your questions, even if they are ignorant.<br>  <br>  You're not wasting my time, you are dishonoring better people than you will ever be who have worn the uniform and payed the ultimate sacrifice. . . while you and your cousins were playing "Air Soft" at your uncles farm.<br>  <br>   Jesus. Tell your drill sergeant your a master blaster "air soft" champ too. That should REALLY push them over the edge.|`|eywqoNjzaa	When you finish basic, and AIT you will be nothing but a private, EVERYONE that finishes still goes to their unit as a private no matter what, unless you have college behind you, trust me, when i say you WILL NOT get e-4 to e-5 anytime at all soon, you only receive  those with time, and your dedication to the military, your recruiter is a dumba$$ not to mention they will tell you anything to get you in. Good Luck|`|DtkLsetkaa	Get it in your head right now that you are totally equal to each and every other recruit you are going to boot with.  Don't even attempt to boss them around or your DS is going to get you for it.  You have that guaranteed rank for your graduation from boot, not while you are in it.  Once you graduate, you will be an E-3, and then start working your way towards other promotions.  But E-5 is going to take you a pretty long time.<br>  <br>  .......did you really ask if you could bring your own guns to boot?  Really?  Please tell me you aren't in a combat mos.|`|zLUQJxJkaa	The fact that I know a rhinoceros (named Gerard) that has a better grasp of the English language than you leads me to believe you are not, repeat not, going to make it in the military. Seriously now, are you old enough to be on Y!A?
26f3d59ead6f91143482bedef9d02e89aa	Clearly it was wrong to issue a citation.  I was bad P.R. and does nothing to help the profession.  Common Sense can not be taught and this Trooper did not use any.  I know it is wrong to jay walk, but a Police Officer must look at the totality of the circumstances.|`|zLUQJxJkaa	Actually trooper is right, he did put himself and those elderly women in that situation. It's good that he got them out of the situation, but ultimately he is the one who put them in it in the first place.|`|ugWaptu2aa	The Trooper was just doing his job in what he believed was a traffic infraction. But because of all of this negative publicity towards the CO State Highway Patrol and the Trooper himself, I would think that the case will be dropped by the prosecutor or whoever is the judge hearing the case. Imagine doing your job and the next day there are national media reports that pretty much label you as a cold and heartless individual? Imagine the trooper's family, and all the negative press that he will be receiving. <br>  Most judges and District Attorneys are elected into office and I doubt that they want to be known as the judge or DA who pursued a case on a good samaritan.|`|vZ4NXlBmaa	"to stupid" huh.......<br>  well said smart guy<br>  <br>  <br>  the 'good samaritan' broke the law, and helped cause a very dangerous situation<br>  sure, he got hurt<br>  and sure, he ended up helping a couple people avoid injury....but had he gone about helping legally in the first place....the whole situation would have been avoided<br>  <br>  <br>  also, you make it seem like you believe all Colorado cops are bad at their jobs. <br>  ...that's a very ignorant (and false) statement|`|LTNLIT98aa	Cops don't care--anymore--they don't protect our quality of life--NOW these public servants--power hungry egotists--determine the quality of your life--<br>  This man no more deserved ticket than the cops who wrote--it up--<br>  Just a way to make money--illegally or not...<br>  Whatever happened to" mitigating' circumstances.<br>  <br>  next time--let them get killed--that's what cops want.|`|AA11494150	The "hero" actually created the dangerous situation himself. Had he not created the situation, there would have been no one to save. By doing this, he risked not only his life, but the lives of the elderly women.<br>  <br>  The media did a nice job of putting a controversial twist on this story. <br>  <br>  With that said, I wouldn't be surprised to see the judge dismiss the ticket and let them work this out in a civil court, if they choose.|`|qEYYHNyyaa	Its funny how they gave the driver a ticket and the jaywalkers. <br>  <br>  How can they justify doing both? Either the jaywalker is at fault or the driver not both.<br>  <br>  Careless driving that led to injury? How could any cop write a ticket like this and not feel like a moral hypocrite.

There are many issues to consider and if you don't have clear values, you can easily be mislead by others.<br>  <br>  I believe that individual rights, equality under the law, and freedom of choice are the most important issues to consider.

I apologize for not knowing for sure what that is though here goes.<br>  <br>  If you were in the US the first thing you should do is read the constitution with the Bill of Rights and all of the subsequent Amendments.  These are the items you take an oath to uphold.  The next thing you would do is read the Federalist and Anti-Federalist Papers along with other personal writings by the founders of the constitution.  This will give you their view in terms of their time and the true meaning of what you are potentially taking an oath to uphold.  I hope you have a firm grasp of Economics and secondarily History.  Economics gives you the basis to make the country work and prosper and History shows you what has been tried, worked and failed.<br>  <br>  To be a leader you must lead.  Go to the source and learn what was actually stated then make your own opinions.  Do not become a moderate.  There are no great moderate leaders.  Think as an economist because theories based on the big picture rue the day and always win in the long run.  Ignore the Lawyers for they concentrate on the small picture with no form or ethics and just a basis for how to get around things.  They live on the exception to the rule.  You must base policy on the rule and what serves the nation as a whole.  I wish you the best if you become educated and stick to the basic principles of democracy and capitalism.  I hope you fail misserably if you base your opinions on polls and what some tv or website said.  Sadly in the US half of the Republicans and all of the Democrats base their views on how the opinion polls have swung today.

S5H0NmEWaa	Only a few countries have the legal right to nuclear weapons under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). They are the US, China, the UK, France and Russia, which inherited the USSR's nuclear stockpile. You may notice that they all have a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. Who's going to argue with them?<br>  <br>  There are also four countries which have nuclear weapons, at least that we know about. India, Pakistan and North Korea have developed their own nuclear capabilities. They are not part of the NPT. It's also an open secret that Israel has nukes, but it has never given an official confirmation of this.<br>  <br>  South Africa worked out how to build nuclear weapons, but then volunteered to dismantle its own bombs and put the recipe in the shredder.
