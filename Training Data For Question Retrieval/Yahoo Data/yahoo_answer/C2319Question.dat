20090203133839AAsKUwZ	Education & Reference;Teaching	Does a teacher have the right to look through a confiscated cell phone?	Today I was texting and my teacher took my phone away from me. Now the problem is, later today I saw her and another teacher looking through my texts. They then saw who I texted, a classmate. They then confiscated his phone, and here is the big problem. The text I sent to this guy had information on it, relating to the teacher who took my phone. The text was an inside sexual joke about her, and when you read it you think of something else, and only me and the other guy understand the joke, which relates to "Her ***" which actually means something entirely different, because "Her ***" actually is code for nothing. One day I was daydreaming and somebody asked me, "Are you staring at her ***?". Which resulted into turning into an inside joke, because I wasn't even looking at her at the time. So in the text when I said something relating to that joke, I did not mean what the teachers think I meant. Do the teachers have the right to look through my phone, and can they suspend or expell me for having something like that on my phone? I will be choosing a best answer so please give me an honest answer with references to back up your answer.

20090203134144AAXHjun	Education & Reference;Special Education	I've just been diagnosed with dyslexia, but my parents don't believe me!  What do I do now?	I went into the university today and had a meeting with a lady, who screened me for dyslexia and said that she thinks I am dyslexic, and definitely dyscalculet (don't know how you spell that one) and that I should have a more in-depth assessment with this guy who knows more about it.  This is because I want to go to uni next year, but I'm not sure about it seeing as I didn't do too well at school.      Anyway, I was feeling so relieved to find out, it was like there is a real reason why I had such a hard time at school and why I seem to find it so hard to do things that everyone else does, and also that I wasn't just lazy at school.  But I told my mum and she just laughed, then I told my dad and he laughed too.  They seem to think that this is just a made up condition or something, and they've been taking the mick out of me all evening now.      I kind of wanted to talk to them about this, you know, it's important to me. Plus, I don't know quite what to do now.  I mean, once you've found out you are dyslexic, what then?

20090203134720AAA1jPv	Education & Reference;Homework Help	PLEASE HELP !!! history...?	Okay I knowww this is reaaallyy long but I really need help with it and you don't have to read the whole thing necessarily!! It's what came from the textbook in order to answer the question.   Here's the question:   In light of his views and behaviour, do you think Thomas Scott was disloyal to his country? Why or why not?      Thomas Scott was a Protestant from Ireland who had come to Ontario in 1863. He was among the first Canadians sent to Red River. He wanted Canada to expand and to be successful. He also wanted it to resist the pressures from the United States, where some politicians spoke about taking over all of Canada. Scott wanted Canada to remain part of the British Empire.    In Ireland at that time, Roman Catholics were permitted very few rights. Scott brought these views with him to Canada. He believed that Catholics should not be allowed to be part of government, and he told everyone about his views. This naturally made him unpopular with many people. In 1869, he drifted into Red River and began to tell people that the Metis were not fit to be part of a government. He said that Cnada should simply ignore them and set up a government without consulting the Metis.   Riel regarded Scott as a threat. Scott was a powerful symbol of opposition to the Metis. If more settlers came from Ontario, Scott might manage to organize them to resist Metis demands. With Riel's approval, the provisional government had Scott arrested and given a court martial. He was found guilty of treason. In march 1870, he was executed by firing squad.      *treason - an act of betrayal or disloyalty to one's country or government*         PLEASEEE HELP ME WITH THIS !!! :)   THANK YOU SOO MUCH ANYBODY WHO ANSWERS HELPFULLY :)

I have a lot of pressure to go into a great university and become really successful and I really want to prove myself, but I'm not sure if I can get into any of those big universities.

I really want to pursue politics and economy in the future and want to be well-known and make a difference and live in the East Coast.   My absolute dream would have to be Yale University, but also George Washington, Columbia, UC Berkeley, Brown, Cornell, or any other good east coast university would be ideal.       Do I honestly have a chance, or are there any other things that I should do to get into one of those universities?

In one approach, the spacing between ions in an ionic substance is determined by using a technique called x-ray diffraction. x-ray diffraction studies of sodium chloride have shown that the distance between adjacent Na+ and Cl- ions is 2.819X10^ -8cm. The density of solid NaCl is 2.165 grams/cm^3. By calculating the molar mass to four significant figures, you can determine Avogadro's number/ What value do you obtain?

20090222181014AAA7oCd	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Homework Spelling check..please..?	My House       Well, aren‚Äôt you so exited to hear about my two stories beautiful house. I live with both of my grandparents, dad (-), mom (-), brother (-), and Me. My house is more of bungalow house style and it was build in 1938 which that makes the house 71 years old, its pretty old but I think its really pretty and conferrable to live in.  The shape of is a square shaped, with many entrances. There‚Äôs three way to enter the house we have a front door which we hardly use, we only use it when guessed come over. Then we have the side door, that takes you straight to the basement, and the back door is the door that we mostly use, and it takes you straight to my favorite place in the house the kitchen‚Ä¶yummy! Let me tell you a little more about my house, theirs four bedrooms, two bathrooms average size, living room, dining room and best of all the kitchen. Then we also have block concrete basement, which it‚Äôs not all fixed yet, and it‚Äôs not that good looking and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs my least favorite thing about the house.  Then there‚Äôs the hipped styles roof, and I really like it because not a lot of new houses have this roof, my house was made for one-family house because there‚Äôs not that many bedrooms, or space to fit two or more families in, but as of right now I live with my grandparents so, its like two-family families livening together, and I love it because its so much fun living with them.  The exterior of the house before was different, but since the house was really old and we had to give a new looking from the outside and we decided to put siding in, pulse before it use to get really cold inside, but since we have siding now, its not cold anymoreJ.  The windows around the house are pretty unique because not a lot of people have the now days that are Queen Anne windows, they have the straight wooden line going up and down, but other then the windows we have nothing else like decks, balconies or anything like that, but later on we might get a deck, because we have a big yard and there‚Äôs a lot of room left. But about couple yards away we have the 2 car garage and that‚Äôs not attached too the house.                     Positive-   Big living room   Big dining rooms    New bathrooms   Two stories   Very big yard      Negatives-   Old   The rooms are too small   Basement too cold   Closets too small       The one thing I like about my house it‚Äôs a very nice quiet neighborhood which I love it , and its really close to the school, so when‚Äôs summer I can just walk. Those are my favorite things about the house that I live in right now.      If I could change anything to the house it would probably be the bedrooms to be a little bigger because I think there just way too small, basement to be fixed because the besetment as of right not, its horrible and I would say pretty scary to go there.  So if I could change anything it would be those two things.       The best memory that would associated to this house that I live in right now, it would be when we first moved in my uncle and his family had to live with us too, and we all had so much fun living together because we where so many people around the house and the time would go by really fest, just by talking to each other, playing games, and etc. So I think that would be the BEST memory about the house when my uncles family and us live together.

20090222172141AAxcHDt	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	Can you pleases help me summarize this ( 10 pts)?	A century ago, 300 African Americans worked together to establish the town of Allensworth, California, a community that thrived for many years. Recently, a two-day celebration was held there to honor the town's 100th birthday. The celebration also paid tribute to the town's place in the history of civil rights.          In honor of its 100th birthday, Allensworth hosted a variety of family events. These included bike rides, music and dance performances, history exhibits, and town tours. Thousands attended. Several guest speakers talked about the town. They said that to its residents, it was more than a hometown; it was a new beginning.          The town of Allensworth is located between Los Angeles and San Francisco. It was founded in 1908 by a retired Army colonel and escaped slave. His name was Allen Allensworth. Allensworth held the honor of being the Army's first African-American colonel. He served in the Civil War. Allensworth set up the town on fertile land in California's San Joaquin Valley. He imagined a place where African Americans could own property and live with dignity in a self-sufficient farming community. His goal was to a build a town that would thrive. He believed it would then alter the poor views of African Americans during a time of intense racism. These views were evidenced first by slavery and then by Jim Crow segregation laws.          "[It was] a conscious effort to combat racism at a time when there was very little [being done to combat it]," said Lonnie G. Bunch. Bunch is founding manager of the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture. Allensworth was unique in its sociological and political mission, Bunch said. "It was more than creating an all-African-American community; there was a national political strategy involved in the founding of Allensworth that makes it unique."          Recognizing that education would be the key to their success, Allensworth residents placed great importance on learning. The town made the school the largest building in town. Citizens taxed themselves in order to hire an additional teacher beyond the one paid for by the state. City planners initially pictured a college in the town center. In 1913, however, California's state government voted down funding during its drive to end segregation. In addition to schools, townspeople valued libraries as a source of learning and erected the county's first free public library.       The public library was only one of the town's many firsts. Allensworth residents elected California's first African-American justice of the peace. They also elected the first African-American constable.          "I call the Allensworth pioneers 'Genius People,'" said Alice Calbert Royal. Royal was born in Allensworth in 1923. "They had a vision that would uplift an entire race of people," she said.       Allensworth flourished for 12 years, until several events caused the town to decline. Colonel Allensworth died suddenly. The wells that irrigated the town's farms dried up. The Santa Fe railroad moved the train's stop to a neighboring town. Eventually, educated young people began moving away in search of jobs.          But Allensworth is sometimes referred to as "the town that refused to die." It went on to assume a different form. In the 1970s, the California government recognized the town's historical importance. It turned Allensworth into a state park. Since then, on streets named after such influential African Americans as Sojourner Truth and Booker T. Washington, many of Allensworth's buildings have been restored. These buildings include several houses, two general stores, a church, and a schoolhouse.       "Out of this community came people who believed‚Ä¶ that anything is possible," said Lonnie Bunch, who spoke at the celebration. `

That quote is, ‚ÄúBe careful on what you say or do because there is always someone watching!‚Äù This is similar in today‚Äôs controversial issue, the Patriot Act. This is a U.S. federal law intended to give the U.S. government authority to surveillance telephone calls, text messages, mail, e-mails, and bank records without warrant anywhere around the world (The Columbia Encyclopedia). I truly believe that many of us should comply with this act and abide by the government rules.

I'm having trouble deciding between print or broadcast, if that amounts to anything. Ryerson is said to have a better "new media" education, while Carleton holds an outstanding reputation for print. I've always felt I can express myself better through writing, but it is a dieing art in the field of journalism. I don't like the idea of acting all "propped up and fake" for the television, reading off a teleprompter and cracking up lame jokes to the weatherman, it's so bogus it disgusts me.      I'm thinking more in terms of international journalism, I've always felt attracted to worldly issues and feel as if I will gravitate towards that, regardless of whether or not I venture into print or broadcast.      Anyways, I'm rambling, any help would be great!

We assume the description of Hamlet"s cruel treatment of Ophelia to be true because it is spoken by:            A.   Polonius    B.   Claudius    C.   Laertes    D.   Gertrude    E.   Ophelia herself    4.

I am teaching my neice, almost 4, how to write letters and numbers. I babysit her everyday and her mom has asked that I take about 30 min or so and work with her on her alphabet and numbers. We are doing really good I have taught her how to write her name. We are on the letter E right now. We try to do a letter everyday or every few days. The problem I have noticed is that when I am teaching her a letter or number she writes it upside down or on its side. I was thinking it was her postier so I had her side up in the chair on her bottom but it is still happening. Is this a common mistake while teaching little ones how to write or is this an issue. Even sometimes letters and numbers she knows well she will sometimes write backwards. So I calmly try to show her why it cannot be like that and explain to her it is incorrect. Usually I can work with her on it and after a few min she will get it. I just want to keep an eye on her i didn't know if this was typical or not. Thanks!
