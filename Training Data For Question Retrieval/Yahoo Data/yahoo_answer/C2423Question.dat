20090220104657AAA61vc	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Comment on this that I wrote, i am 13?	The beautiful rain            The beautiful, beautiful rain,   How soft it is upon her resting face.   She who lies alone, from the drying pain,   From the beautiful, beautiful rain.      Her eyelids are wide, like the petals of a rose,   The storm will drown her dust coloured hair.   Of eternities path, the woman now knows,   She who will lie in the shattering air.      Sealed lips that sung a weak parting song,   A lullaby that died in the drenched, greying air.   The falling of water, to weaken the strong,   To soak her small shoulders, so white and so bare.      How long had she lay there,   In the sweet fall of water?   In the cascading storm that veiled her face...   Dead beneath the wide clay sky.      She who lies in death, who embraces your soul,   She who drinks the water from your soft, flowing blood.   To brush, so lightly, into the black and bruised hole,   A weeping kiss that deepens the cloud drooling flood.

20090220105335AAlfgAW	Arts & Humanities;Dancing	Should men learn to dance?	I am a 23 year old man and I never learned to dance. Many people have encouraged me, but I’ve always been hesitant. I’ve been shy all my life and I have a hard time conversing with people I just met, especially women. This is one of the main reasons why I’m single and never had a girlfriend.       My parents have tried to convince me to dance, but I would never go for it. They tell me that it will help me get used to being around women and it will help boost my self-esteem. Are they correct about this? Will dancing really help me get used to being around women and also help open me up?

20090220110446AAZUwdb	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Hey. Does anyone know the title to this romance book?	The story is a romance novel. I think this is how the plot goes, I cant be certain since it's been years since I read the novel. It's set in two different times. One being I think Egypt centuries before where there was a orphan who was brought to the temples where she was believed to be a goddess. She and the prince fell in love as years went by but they knew that they could not be together. But there was a ritual, in which there was a row of women who were raised in the temple and that a certain night, one would be possessed by the goddess and she was to make love to the prince. The prince knew that the orphan was one of the girls and chose her. I'm not sure what happened but the orphan girl got pregnant and had a baby. The prince's betroth or wife (cant remember) was jealous and wanted to the orphan girl gone. Somehow the girl escaped but somehow, the characters became immortal because the book also takes place in modern times where the prince and the orphan girl cross path but must find a way to to escape from the jealous girl.    Sorry about my description since I only remember bits and parts about the story.  It's just soemthing that is bothering me.    Thanks!

20090220114135AA6ZTBq	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	IS this a good beginning to a story?	I've read this again and again and can't decide if I'm happy with it. Any comments would be useful than you!      I sigh as I eye myself up and down in the mirror. Wishing I could look like my sister Sadie, just for tonight at least. There's no point bothering with make-up, after a few failed attempts I have to accept it just makes me look like soe sort of clown. I don't know why I've suddenly become so obsessed. I try not to care how I look, normally I don't. I'm not sure why tonights so different. Well, it is different. I guess. I'm not going on some sort of date if that's what you think. I don't do dates. I don't remember ever being asked out. Tonights my first job and I'm panicking. Everything has to go right or else. That's what mum says at least. Dad tells her to give me a break and that I'm not even 15. Then they argue and fight and something ends up getting broken. Sadie cries and I give her a hug and tell her it will all be alright. She hugs me back because she doesn't want to be alone. Normally it's dad ending up apologizing to mum. Saying he was wrong to argue and he makes her a cup of tea and everything goes back to normal. Mum and dad give Sadie plenty of attention then, they forget they have me as a daughter. Sadie forgets she has a sister. She shouts and tells me it's my fault that they argue and fight and that if I didn't exist they would be a perfectly happy family. I insist that they were my family first and life only became hectic when she arrived. But then I wonder if Sadie was right. This is how it always goes. The next day everythings forgotten.    Sadies being sweet to me now. She caught me looking in the mirror, attempting to sort myself out a bit "Good luck Ellie. You're gonna be great with these kids, you don't need to look beautiful. Just like you're great with me. I'll miss you"   Mum isn't being sweet at all. "This had better go well. I'm warning you, you put a toe out of line and you'll lose this job. People don't trust just anyone with their kids. Everything i to go perect, you hear me?"   I promise her.   I forget about my appearence. Like Sadie pointed out. It's the babysitting that's more important.   I don't bother to tackle my hair. I shrug into my old hoodie. It's far too small for me now. It probably fits Sadie better than me. I need new trainers aswell. I only realise now how grubby mine are as I pull them on.   "Be careful" Dad warns   Mum refuses to give me a lift. She seems to be in a constant bad mood nowadays. She's changed too. Normally, I wasn't even allowed to wander the streets in daylight. Now, it's pitch black and I'm hurrying down Millers Road warily. I jam my hands into my jeans pocket.   Why am I so scared, the Inghams only live three streets away. There is no reason to be scared.   Soon, I will find out there is a reason to be scared. A reason to be very scared. Right now I'm an average child walking along an average road at 7.30 in the evening. But tonight I'll be somebody diferent. Someone I've never even dreamed about

He was a character that you could really feel for, especially when he was a child in the book. Stephen really captured being a kid and the journeys you'd embark on.       I also really enjoy Nick from The Stand. I think a mute is a very interesting character. And, it has to be a challenge to write for someone who can't speak... but Mr. King did it really well. Made him very likable and admirable.

There are couples who love each other so much, that no one can break they strong bond. But they don't have sex, just cuddle, kiss.      This is a debate with someone, who thinks Lust is part of Love.   This is her reply:   "Love doesn't 'beat' lust. Lust, and sex, are a PART of love"      But im just thinking thats not true, because people just love sex, and not love that person. Love & lust is two complete word... u can show affection, but its different from lust.      You should "Love" before u "Lust"

Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,   Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;   But do not dull thy palm with entertainment   Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware   Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,   Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.   Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;   Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.   Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,   But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;   For the apparel oft proclaims the man,   And they in France of the best rank and station   Are of a most select and generous chief in that.   Neither a borrower nor a lender be;   For loan oft loses both itself and friend,   And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.   This above all: to thine ownself be true,   And it must follow, as the night the day,   Thou canst not then be false to any man.

20090220112452AA3oURK	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Does anyone know the title of this book? It's about a young woman (maybe 19) who gets married to an older...?	It's about a young woman (maybe 19) who gets married to an older guy (prob in his thirties). She thinks he only married her because he needed a wife (and I think she might have even heard her father or someone say that). They get back to his home where there's water near by and a boat house. She tries to run the house but she's always really jealous of the memory of the man's first wife who died at the boat house.      Anyway, as the book goes on, it's revealed that he never really loved his first wife. She was really awful to him and made him brush her hair and things like that. I think he found out that she was pregnant with someone else's baby and has her killed or something.      There might be a tree in the title or on the cover...

I forgot what time it happened as well... but the general story goes like this   There is 2 species of these crop, one with higher yield and another with lower yield. A country that originally plant the specie with lower yield decided to grow the specie with higher yield, so they begin to grow the specie with higher yield. However, the specie with lower yield are immune to certain disease, and higher yield did not. After the plantation of the specie with higher yield, the disease struck and killed all the crops... so the locals have to change back to lower yield crop.
20090220115415AA3CfdG	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is this a good piece of writing(WARNING: It is long)?	My friend wrote this and I wanted to see what everyone thought. I personally loved it.      My favorite sense is smell.   Crisp winter mornings had such a distinct smell. Whether you wake up before dawn when the sky is so incredibly clear, or when the sun has already been up, and it is bright enough for you to watch the Cardinals eat from the birdfeeder. The only word to describe what a winter morning smells like is ice, or perhaps snow. I love stepping onto my porch, still curled up in warm pajamas, and experiencing the cold, sharp icy scent.    Cool spring nights with the attic fan give me such a feeling of comfort. The early budding nature outside is so fresh compared to the stuffy winter air that has not been let out of the house. These nights do not only provide me comfort; they also remind me of the exciting beautiful weather to come. I remember those nights as a little girl, my brothers would come jump on my bed to say goodnight. Then they ended up putting on a comic act when they left.    Every person I know, except my middle brother, thinks I am weird for liking the smell of Bradford Pear trees. Those are the ones that people say smell “fishy”. It is not so much the pleasure of the aroma that pleases me; it is what is associated with it… springtime. New buds are on all of the trees and bushes. There is a layer of yellow pollen on all outside surfaces, but I don’t mind. It is spring; it is new; it is a lovely scent of fishy.    It happens every time. I am supposed to be cleaning my room or some other task and then I end up just laying there, on the floor. My floor has a loved, worn, and carpet freshener smell to it. My first memory of the floor smell was when I wanted to be like my brothers, and play with toy racecars around the open air vent. I thought I was so cool when they let me play with them. The air-conditioning was blowing the aroma of the floor up at us. It was hard not to recognize it, and even harder not to associate such a simple and happy memory with it. There have been times when I end up lying on the floor and end up napping there. I have never had a problem waking up to that smell.   I went to the beach a day before my parents; my grandparents took me down with them since we were in the condo next door. The weather on the first morning was incredible. Of course, the first day at the beach is always exciting. After watching the early beach bums out and about, I took a shower. I washed m hair with Clinique shampoo. There could not have been a better smell in the entire world for that moment. Still today I can be in the shower, close my eyes, smell the sweet shampoo, and feel like I am at the beach.    You know it is going to be a fun day when it starts with the smell of sunscreen. I do not think I can remember a time where I have not enjoyed a day that was accompanied with sunscreen. When my brothers and I were little, we would draw faces and animals in the sunscreen as we rubbed in on each other’s back. It was always harder for them because they had to lather around with my bathing suit straps.   I have a small creek in my backyard. Going back there always makes me think of my best friend growing up. He was two years younger than me, but we played together all the time. He taught and helped me how to catch crawfish and salamanders. We ended up doing that more most of the summer. Once he had about twenty of each!    Christmas is absolutely packed with memories for me. Of course, there is the smell of the Christmas tree. One year after we had picked our tree, my brothers and I got to ride in the back of the truck with the smell of pine blowing in our faces. Also, Christmas cookies are a huge tradition at my house; baking and decorating takes almost all day, but it is worth it. I am biased, but I think this recipe is the best! On Christmas morning, after opening all of our presents, we eat cinnamon rolls and then drive down to South Georgia to celebrate the day with family. The small town of Dawson has a peanut mill, and every time we get there the windows go down, because everyone is trying to get a whiff of the sweetest peanut butter you will ever smell.

She was left on my hands because her flippant mother, an actress, abandoned her and went away with some man. I hired a governess for Adele, and  she proved to be a real treasure as well as a fascinating, charming young woman. I fell in love and proposed. We were to be married in a local church, but during the wedding it was disclosed that I was already married abroad, and had a wife. My wife is a certified lunatic, a mad woman, but I treat her well and hired a very good nurse to look after her, a Grace Poole. When Jane, my fiancee, found out that it was to be a sham marriage, she simply ran away. I am very concerned about her. She is an orphan, and her only income was the salary that I paid her. She left all he belongings, including the jewelry I bought her behind. She has no money, no family, no one to turn to. I have put advertisements in the newspapers and hired a lawyer to help me looking for her. I am devastated. I did not mean to lie to her, I was just afraid that she would not marry me if she knew the truth, and that she would dump me. I don't want anything from her, just to help her with her life. I want to find her. What should I do?

20090220135626AAr1SE5	Arts & Humanities;History	" he climbed up on the roof of the train and began handing in protective passes through the doors which were "?	"... he climbed up on the roof of the train and began handing in protective passes through the doors which were not yet sealed. He ignored orders from the Germans for him to get down, then the Arrow Cross men began shooting and shouting at him to go away. He ignored them and calmly continued handing out passports to the hands that were reaching out for them. I believe the Arrow Cross men deliberately aimed over his head, as not one shot hit him, which would have been impossible otherwise. I think this is what they did because they were so impressed by his courage. After Wallenberg had handed over the last of the passports he ordered all those who had one to leave the train and walk to the caravan of cars parked nearby, all marked in Swedish colours. I don't remember exactly how many, but he saved dozens off that train, and the Germans and Arrow Cross were so dumbfounded they let him get away with it "   "   Sandor Ardai, one of the drivers working for Wallenberg talking about   Raoul Wallenberg The man who saved the jews he saved 100,000 lives in world war II     Source(s):Wikipedia,      Your comments please

20090203040126AA62AbY	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What do you think of my poems? (Part 2)?	It didn't show ALL my poems due to the word limit so let me continue.      Truth & Lies...      Some people hide the truth,   Some people hide it well.   Hidden so even sleuths,   Simply cannot tell...   Some people hide behind a veil,   So none shall ever see,   What hides behind layered lies,   And touch the real, true Me...   Hollow and Empty,   Emotionless, a Void.   A detached state of Mind,   With humanity to avoid.   To discover the Truth,   You must toss falsehoods aside.   Lies within Truth,   And Truth within Lies...   A glimmer of brightness,   Shines in Eternal Night.   A spectre of shadow,   Flickers in Daylight...   In Light there is Dark,   And in Dark there is Light.   As such was pre-ordained,   Never ceasing, with no respite...      Life...      Life is fragile, so treasure it well.   For it is a gift, which no merchant may sell.   People are born and people die,   People forlorn and then they sigh.   Life is eternal and is always there,   Yet Death can take it, it does not care.   Life is everyone's, theirs, yours, and mine,   Yet the Reaper may come, without a sign.   Everyone has their Appointed Hour,   And so the petals fall from that fragrant flower.   Watch the Sands of that Hourglass,   For Life, like sand, will come and pass.   Each grain is one you take for granted,   So revel in each, Life so enchanted.   Treasure each moment before The End,   Until the beckoning from Heaven they send...      In Light and Shadow...      In the Darkness, quickly you'll find,   There's something following, creeping up from behind.   Into the Abyss, those bottomless depths,   Your courage has fled, gone, bereft.   Hide from your fears, from that hate-filled glare,   Wherever you go, it'll always be there.   Be afraid, very afraid, feel the fear,   For you shall lose everything you once held dear.   You're stranded, dark and alone in the Abyss,   Waiting, dreading, for Death's last kiss...   Fear is your Master, wearing you as its crown,   With you now and forever, forever and now...   Fear strips away all, leaving you hollow and dead,   No more courage, leaving things left unsaid.      But into the Light, now you see,   That not everything was what you thought it to be      Now...      In the Darkness quickly you'll find,   That fear is nothing but a trick of the mind.   Into the Abyss, those bottomless depths,   Your courage is gone, there's nothing left.   Confront your fears, if you dare,   If you look you'll find there's nothing there.   Why be afraid of what was never here,   No need to look at what horror draws near.   For you see, it does not exist,   Pierce the illusion, like a fading mist.   Fear is a burden, dragging you down,   Under the water, it's making you drown.   Clear your mind and look straight ahead,   Ignore the fears that bow your head.      So...      Walk into the Light, without uncertainty,   And be all the things you know you can be...   Rejoice in life, in all its vibrant splendour,   Triumph over fear, make it surrender.   But fear is eternal, it cannot be discouraged,   For without fear, there cannot be courage.   Light and Shadow entwined are one,   Needing each other, like the Moon and Sun.   Forever in balance, in perfect harmony,   'Till the end of Time, that is their Destiny...

I am in the woods,   Trees engulf me all around,   This place is without a sound,   No light pertrudes or sees me there,   Life is without a care,   Lost inside my mind,    There is no rhyme I find,   Worries flutter away like butterflies,   Rain starts to pour,   The prince and the flimsy girl kiss in the rain,   Undying love on their lips,   Hearts filled with graceful devotion,   Emotion runs deep,   But something is wrong,   Reality is missing,   Just a bystander,   Gazing down on our world,   With eyes that cannot see,   Fingers that never touch,   And a mind that runs free,

The author's name was Wilke, or Wilkie.  The book I remember best had a plot that centered around the "Counting Crows" poem (One crow for sorrow, two crows for joy, etc).  Can anybody help??

Evil is learking around the corner,  tall and defensive,   putting up walls around what once was innocence.    we'll take our skills, and do them a favor.    take all this away, we'll become the savior.       No more blood, no more pain.    no more hurt to abolish the name.    we've stood tall, and fought hard.   these endless days, our memorys scarred.

20090220131446AABfnkg	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of my writing style? you don't have to read it all?	just tell me what you think           Grandma’s basement was ancient, dark and dank, and filled with endless piles of junk. Boxes, trunks, and bins of every size and shape were scattered across the floor, lining the walls, and towering from to the ceiling. It was exactly four days after Grandma’s funeral and mom was devastated. She couldn’t even walk into Grandma’s house, let alone sort through all her junk, so that job was left up to me. My directions exactly: “Sort out her stuff: keep, sell, throw away.” How I was possibly supposed to discern what was worth selling and what needed to be kept at ten years old, I have no idea.    I had been sifting through Grandma’s gadgets for hours when I came upon a strange pouch. It was made of the purest velvet hands could feel, the violet and gold of royalty, with a silk drawstring. I was just about to toss it over my shoulder into the steadily growing “sell” pile when a sliver of light escaped the bag, thrown across the wall for a second before it disappeared. I blinked, rubbed my eyes and reached out, tentative fingers struggling to hook the thin drawstring between them.    Inside, there was nothing but a little black box. I snapped it open to reveal yet another, smaller pouch. I tugged at the caught zipper, finally releasing it with an extra hard yank. The sack flew from my hands, it’s descent intercepted by the far wall.    It landed hard and a bulky golden chain slipped out, dragging with it an oval-shaped pendant. I scrambled after it, and after a few seconds, I realized that the pendant was hinged: a locket. It was finely crafted and likely ancient, but it bore no scratches or dents. In fact, it was in perfect condition, and still shining as if it had just been polished. In the very center of the locket was a tiny diamond. Intricate tendrils spiraled from the diamond, covering the entire surface of the charm in swirling golden lines.    I was utterly captivated by the design and I found myself prying open the locket mindlessly, eager to inspect it further.    With an indescribably jolt in my gut, I landed feet first in what looked like a dungeon (I wouldn’t know, I’d never actually seen one.) Lofty walls of stone stretched so far that they disappeared into shadows. There were no lights or windows, but somehow a dim glow illuminated the place.

20090203024630AAwZLle	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Can you make an analysis about this Poem?....Please..analyse this..help.?	Please help me...Please give me your analization about this poem...                               To My Fellow Children      Whenever people of a country truly love   The language which by heaven they were taught to use,   That country also surely liberty pursues   As does the bird which soars to freer space above.      For language is the final judge and referee   Upon the people in the land where it holds sway;   In truth our human race resembles in this way   The other living being born in liberty.      Whoever knows not to love his native tongue   Is worse than any beast or evil smelling fish.   To make our language richer ought to be our wish   The same as any mother loves to feed her young      Tagalog and the Latin language are the same   And English and Castilian and the angel's tongue,   And God, whose watchful care over all is flung,   Has given us His blessing in the speech we claim,      Our mother tongue, like all the highest that we know   Had alphabet and letters of its very own;   But these were lost- by furious waves were overthrown   Like bancas in the stormy sea,long years ago.

What is life, if not a gem of dust compressed   In daedel hands, seeled, with hermetic power   Abloom an instant on a fenneled tower   A diadem of visons opalesced.   What is life, if not a stormy sea   On which, but for the hour, you're set to sail   And quest quixotically to grasp the grail   'Til Tritons trumpet, calling home to thee.   What is life, if not the secret of a fateful gift   That once it's opened scourges you with thorn.   And yet, the hand that animates the glove   So cleverly designed to hold and lift   In triumph, tips a laurel-wreathèd horn   And sounds the sorrowing shell to hapless love

Conduct and teach me in thy ways   O sacred seed, for all my days   To harvest, winnow, and depart.   Let down thy silken twist to me   And by your grace, I'll climb to thee.

Please, critique as much as you like and give me your opinions. Thanks.       Midnight      Vivid heads upon a pin cushion   glisten as they speak   the naive words of a romantic:   “Why does the darkness look so bleak   if our ancestors    are resting amongst it?   (So wise and bright,   so finely lit!)   Oh how I envy the eternity    that they must have acquired!   But how I love the intensity   of their glory to which I aspire    to match with my mere talents,   my morsel of soul and hopeless fire,    but though I’m not brave nor gallant,   at least my position isn’t dire!   But look! Look into the distance!   I see a shinning beacon!    Can you not see it too?   This is a light that will not weaken,   for it is a familiar cue!   My mother! I see can her face,   oh how I loved her so…   And though she is in another place,   at least she's not met by woe…”   What fools they are!   For as they gaze at yonder star,   they fail to realise that their “mother”   is quite simply just another   plane in the midnight sky.

20090220124256AAo1Edp	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Not quite a poem, but thoughts of a dying woman I had to share...Hope you dont mind?	IF I HAD MY LIFE TO LIVE OVER - by Emma Barwick   (written after she found out she was dying from cancer)      I would have gone to bed when I was sick or taken a holiday when I was tired, instead of pretending the earth would go into a holding pattern if I weren't at work for a few days.       I would have taken the time to listen to my grandfather ramble about his youth.       I would have shared more of the responsibility carried by my spouse.       I would have danced more.      I would have watched more sunsets      I would never have insisted the car windows be rolled up on a summer day because my hair would be a mess.      I would have sat on the lawn with my grass stains.       I would have cried and laughed less while watching television and more while watching life.       I would never have bought anything just because it was practical, wouldn't show soil, or was guaranteed to last a lifetime.      When my kids kissed me impetuously, I would never have said, 'Later’….      There would have been more 'I love you's'. More 'I'm sorry's.'       But mostly, given another shot at life, I would seize every minute, look at it and really see it, live it and never give it back. STOP SWEATING THE SMALL STUFF!!!       Don't worry about who doesn't like you, who has more, or who's done what.      Forgive. Not only others, but yourself as well…..      Cherish the relationships we have with those who do love us and accept all the love that is given freely each day, for it may be your last.

I'm in a 300-level history class and discussion is 30% of my grade.  I'm a sophomore and thinking about being a history major but this is only my 2nd history class.  It's a pretty small class and a lot of the other students are juniors and seniors well into their major and there is also a law student.        I do participate in my other classes and it's really frustrating that I can't get myself to participate more in this class since I actually have a participation grade for this class.        So I think my main problem is not being able to think critically enough when I'm reading for the class and fast enough.  Any tips?        Any tips in general?  Should I be asking myself certain questions as I am reading?

I'm really struggling with the protagonist's appearance. Usually I am too picky, and I can't seem to think "Oh, yeah, this look seems to suit him" so I'd like you guys' input.      He's pretty much an anti-hero. His thinking is a irrational sometimes. He's a bit stubborn and conceited. He's a pretty loyal guy to those he likes, but disagreeable to those he doesn't. Fun-loving, too carefree sometimes. In early twenties.       Yeah that's just a gist. Thanks in advance.

You've never been been here, never ever.   All you feel inside is the beauty of the scene   And what has happened here.   What the past has caused.   Feelings, by the river.

20090220103035AAwNbHR	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Who wants to read my awesome poem?	We had to write a short poem for school. Here's mine:            Take any high school movie   And between the jocks and nerds   There's one outcast, one underdog   Who won't go with the herd      Sometimes it's a lonely girl   Who dresses all in black   Sometimes it's an quiet guy   A loner, a sad sack.      But the thing they have in common   Is that when the movie's done   We sit back and think to ourselves,   "I want to be THAT one."      We all want to be different   To be seen as weird or new   So when people see us they will say   "I should be like that, too."      And so the revolution starts   When one kid at a time   Replaces their identity   With the one they want to mime.      They'll throw away their sweatpants   And the shirts they used to wear   And instead buy tight skinny jeans   And rub black dye in their hair.      But when they walk down the hallways   No insults will others fling   Because they're no longer outcasts;   They're wearing the same thing!      Nobody is the darkest one   Nobody stands out more   You can't be the lone wolf   When you're just another boar.      Black pants and studs don't hide the fact   That you're following the drum   You can shine like silver all you want   But you're just aluminum.               What do you think?

20090220144831AAbJCvI	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Writing A book...Do I have a chance (Excerpt to read)?	Hi I'm kenzi and right now I'm trying to write a book. Here's an excerpt from it lemme know if you think I have a chance:      The sky was the color of tar.  It was the blackest, black could be. Thunder boomed in the darkness as rain poured down onto the vacant grounds.  Lightning flashed in the sky illuminating turrets and windows in abundance.  The castle was in complete darkness and if someone were to glance at it their first assumption would be either that everyone was asleep or the castle was empty.  However, if that person were to look a little closer they would have seen a girl looking through one of the turret windows, tears streaming down her face….    Anggie shivered and turned her back to the window.  She shivered again as she slid down the wall into a sitting position.  Anggie fought back her second round of burning tears, as she gazed into the darkness before her.  Anggie was furious at her parents and a million thoughts ran through her head. How could her parents send her here to boarding school in Romania? Was it not enough that she had promised to change? Sighing she remembered their exact words when they broke the news to her. “Sweetie we were talking and we think that you need a little more adventure in your life and you should try to make a lot of friends.” Yep, those words would haunt her forever.     Anggie turned back toward the sky.  She had always felt better after looking into the sky. Something about it consoled her, something not exactly normal but not strange either.  Yawning Anggie looked around the chamber.  All of a sudden a painting of a knight caught her eye. Eccentrically, the eyes of the knight seemed to be moving back and forth as if they were looking for something.  Anggie shook her head and rubbed her eyes, she was probably just tired.  Careful not to wake the other sleeping girls, she climbed into her bed hoping that tomorrow she would wake up and find this all to be a bad dream.    Creak, creeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeak!  Anggie awoke with a start. Sitting up she looked around and saw a girl named Madeline emerging through the trap door.  Madeline quickly climbed into her bunk and as she was doing so, Anggie noticed a slight bulge in her shirt.  “What the” Anggie began. She was a little groggy from just waking up.     “shhhhh” Madeline hissed, “you must tell no one I was out of my bunk.”    “But why” Anggie began but was again cut off.     “Sometimes I just need to get out of this stuffy chamber, and be by myself so I can think.” Anggie craned her neck and looked around the chamber. There were about twenty-five plush beds pushed against the walls forming a circle, and a number of assorted chairs and couches spread out in the center.  Small windows dotted the walls and right in the middle of the chamber was the wooden trap door that Madeline had emerged through just moments before.  “I suppose” Anggie began, “This chamber does get a little stuffy with the windows being so small.”      “Exactly” Madeline said, “you understand.” The room darkened a bit and Anggie looked out the window only to see that the rain was still coming down hard. Again the portrait of the knight caught her eye and again Anggie could swear that the eyes were moving. “Madeline” Anggie whispered, “Look at that portrait of the knight.”    “What about it?”    “hmm” Anggie thought, she didn’t know how to explain what see saw without Madeline thinking she was crazy. “When I looked at the portrait before, I could have sworn that the eyes were looking straight at me!”    “Don’t be ridiculous” Madeline said, “There’s no way that the eyes on a portrait could move.  You must have been hallucinating.” Just then the other girls in the chamber started to stir as their alarms went off. “Remember” Madeline hissed, “not a word” and with the slam of the trap door Madeline was off.     Groaning Anggie started to get dressed.  She actually liked the school uniforms very much. The uniforms varied a little and her uniform consisted of a white polo shirt, a purple and white plaid skirt, white knee high socks, a purple tie, and a deep purple robe.  She also had a purple sweater but since she was wearing her robes, she wouldn’t need her sweater today.  Looking in one of the many mirrors Anggie admired herself. All of a sudden an ice cold shiver went up her spine, and Anggie could feel a pair of eyes on her.  She spun around and looked out the window but no one was watching her.  As Anggie continued getting dressed she still couldn’t shake the feeling that she was being watched.  ‘Ah well’ Anggie thought, no use waiting around here or she’d miss breakfast.      Anggie opened the trap door and started climbing down the steep stairs.  Reaching the bottom Anggie nearly collided with a boy with fierce red hair carrying a stack of books. “Sorry” Anggie mumbled but the boy was already gone. Anggie sighed. She didn’t feel much like breakfast anymore.      Walking over to the fireplace Anggie collapsed in one of the oversized chairs.  Realizing that she h

I am auditioning for the role of Pepper, but a lot of other really amazing girls are too. To audition, we have to sing a song that's about one minute long, and read a monologue that the directer provides.               I'm not too worried about that acting part, for I feel that I am a pretty strong actor. But I'm just on ok singer, and I am an alto voice part. I am planning on singing the beginning part of popular from Wicked.      Any other song suggestions would be great. And some advice on how to really impress the director would be nice too!      thanks!   p.s. i still have 11 days until the auditions.

20090220140234AAS84JR	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Different styles of meditation?	Ive heard of different styles of meditation, like the kind where you just sit and chant to yourself, the kind where you do a pose of some sort with or without chanting, where you lay and breathe a certain way, basically all the ones that you can easily find by looking at a meditation website or wikipedia or various books on the subject.      However, I saw a book a while back, cant remember what it was called and the book was already gone when I went back, but it dealt with meditation or Tai Chi but while walking. I dont know how accurate that is, but I couldve sworn it said something like Walking Chi or Walking Meditation. Anyways, I am wondering if anyone has ever heard of that, if so how do I do it.       Also, what other forms are there that focus on meditation, like Tai Chi, Qigong, Yoga, etc., I would like to know all the different styles of it, so I can pick one and go with it. I dont have trouble sitting still or anything, its just I find it easier to think of nothing when I am moving. Anyways, any help would be greatly appreciated, really want to start meditating, just want to find the right style first. By the way, Im not religious in any way, but I did grow up Christian and that is the God I prefer, but Id like to keep religion out of it, I feel its better that way.

I'm currently reading Alex Rider: Stormbreaker by Anthony Horowitz. It's not TOO confusing, but it does have some difficult parts to it for me. I'm thinking of starting to read the Harry Potter series, and maybe the CHERUB series. Please suggest more books!

Currently, in a psychology/literature, we are reading the book Crime and Punishment, which I am having difficulty following along with.

Just recently, I got the movie with Patrick Dempsey but am not sure how much based on the book it is since it is only 1 hr and 30 minutes.  Would anyone who has possibly read crime and punishment and/or saw the movie know if I ccan ascertain enough information from the movie to understand the psychological aspects of the story.   I know it may sound like I am trying to take a shortcut, but have already read  part 1 and part 2 of this book and the structure of how its written is different than whatIi am accustomed to.

Can you please read it and tell me what you think about it and what should I do. Does it make sense?    NO ESCAPE      Pre-face          I woke up  lieing on the floor. Blood all over me. Blood all around me. Dead bodies. I was scared. I heard something around the corner of the book shelf. Someone breathing heavily and walking on broken glass.   I turned around and saw someone with an apron on and blood all over him. I couldn't see his face. He had a axe and he was walking towards me. I screamed and tried to get up, but fell. I thought my ankle was broken. I crawled as fast as I could. He took one try to chop my foot off, but he missed.    I grabbed onto the counter and stood up. I trembled a little but walked as fast as I could. I found a gun laying on the floor and picked it up. I took a shot at him but missed.   He kept on walking towards me. I screamed again. I heard someone behind me. Some guy picked me up and started running. He said everything was going to be alright. I didn't believe him. I was scared for the first time of my life.   We ran to the door, but it wouldn't open. He was behind us. He threw his axe at us...      Chapter 1 ~Anniversary~          I just finished my lunch break at work. The thirty minutes went by slow. I still had two hours of work. I got back to my desk and started entering the files. My boss came into my office. "Hello Lisa. You have a call on line four. It's your husband."   "Ok. I'll get straight to it Larry." I smiled at him and grabbed the phone. "Hello Michael. What do you want?"   "You still up to dinner?"   "Yeah, I am."   "Ok. I'll meet you at the restaurant at eight thirty. I'm working late again." He chuckled.   "Ok. I love you."   "I love you too." He hung the phone up. I went back to work. The rest of the day went by fast.   I grabbed my keys and headed to my car. I jumped in my car and turned it on. The has tank was close to empty so I drove to the gas station. I got out of the and started filling it up with gas. "Hello Losa. How are you?" I didn't see who said my name until I turned around.    "Oh! Hey Jeremiah. How is Barbara?"   "She is great and what about Michael?"   "Oh he's living. We're going to dinner tonight. We're going to that new Italian restaurant."   "Is today your anniversary?"   "Yes, and he's paying."   "Oh, well I gotta go. Nice talking to you again."   "Same here. Bye Jeremiah."   "Bye." He walked off and I walked into the store after filling my car up with gas. I grabbed a few packs of gum. I paid the cashier twenty dollars for the gas and two dollars for the gum. I took my receipt and drove all the way home.   I grabbed the key out from under the door mat and unlocked the door. I stepped inside and saw red rose pedals on the floor. They led all the way to my bedroom. I followed them into my room. On the bed was four roses and a rectangular box. I opened the box and lying inside it was a diamond necklace. With it, was a note. It said: "Happy anniversary. See you tonight. Love Michael." I smiled.   I took an hour shower and did my hair. I curled and sprayed it with hair spray. I took my black eye liner and did my eyes. I put the rest of my make up on and put a cute dress on. It was black with leather lace. Its length was just above my knees, I put on black heels and walked out the door.   I got into my car and drove to the restaurant. When I pulled up, Michael was standing in front of his car. "Hello Lisa, you like the diamond necklace I bought you?"   "Yes. I love it. How much did it cost you?"   "Umm. Five-thousand dollars."   "Five thousand dollars?" my mouthdropped open. He spent five-thousand dollars on a necklace for me?   "Yes. Now let's go eat. I'm starving." We both laughed. He opened the door and led me to the table. He pulled the chair out for me and I sat down. The waitress came to our table. "Hello. My name Caroline and I will be your waitress this evening. Are you two ready to order?"   "Yes we are. I would like the chicken ravioli. My wife would like..." I cut him off.   "I want the chicken salad and a glass of water."   "Ok. Would you like some wine."   "Yes. Bring a whole bottle of white wine please." Michael answered. The waitress left the table and brought our food and drinks to us. "Heres to our 6th anniversary." Michael toasted. He poured us both a glass of white wine and took a sip of it. "I was thinking."   "And what was you thinking Michael?"   "We don't have any kids and I was thinking we could..." I cut him off. "We are NOT having a baby."   "But..."   "And no buts. We're not having a baby and that's final."   "Ok. We ate dinner in silence. When we finished, we drove home. I parked my car and grabbed the key our from under the door mat. I unlocked the door and put the key back. We walked into the house and he sat at the table. I went to go take a shower. When I finished, I walked out of the bathroom and he was sitting on the bed with his shirt off.   "I don't even know why you want a child n

She'd been gone for a few months now   gone away even further than the rest   last we heard she was living in Seattle   in sin with my best friend's dad      I thought of that salmon I caught on that day   wiping away tears of complete loneliness   we threw him back in the water that day    to swim back and return to his friends      that was the right thing to do         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   Question:  Did the repetition of words or phrases give the speaker the voice of a child?

I'm making a video for my boyfriend and I have a title on each slide and I want a good definition of the word but I want it to kind of be like a quote and be cute. Like for love i put "The most spectacular and indescribable feeling for someone. When you always want to be with that person. You accept the person completely and are always thinking about them."    I just want some cute quotes about relationships but right now I'm trying to find a dance one because I have pictures from homecoming and winterball.

20090220133341AAbEuN7	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	What about Hate for Hate?	I'm all aflutter for pacifism after reading Tolstoy, and taking part in some serious reflection.

How can one overcome this paradox outside the obvious/cliche trope 'fill your heart with love and all will be well!'?

My love      I picture his face.      It brings memories of    laughter and green grass blowing   in the breeze.   Lips arousing ecstasy while    the ease of his manner engulfs   my soul and absolves me.         And Still…      the earth turns   The sun shines    While stars above   blanket my sky.

20090220131741AAzPInV	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Drawing & Illustration	Sketching technique...?	Okay. I've been sketching for about two years now. My current pencil sketching technique is alright, but I see room for improvement. The best way I personally feel I impove is when I get advice and constructive criticism (emphasis on constructive, not demoralizing). so please look at my sketches on deviantART:    http://caligoamplexus963.deviantart.com/    (look at the ones obviously in pencil)   I feel as if my drawings are novice and just okay.   Any advice on detail, how to make them more realistic, etc., would be extremely appreciated.   The reason I ask you to observe my pictures isn't to "show off," by the way. It's so I don't get advice on things that I already know.   Also, I'd like advice on techniques with charcoal. I REALLY would appreciate advice on that. I'm terrible with it... :/      NOTE: The majority of my pictures consist of Marilyn Manson. I find him quite the interesting subject...
20090220133020AAlxta0	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Does this make any sense?	I've heard the "If everything is Abnormal, then everything is considered Normal" speech a million times. It basically just explains that nothing is Normal but then contradicts it by saying that if everything is Abnormal, then everything must be Normal. that kind of thing.      The Question: If you know Everything does that mean that you know Nothing?      Does that question relate to the "Normal, Abnormal" speech at all?   Does it contradict the "Normal, Abnormal" speech?   Please explain this to me?
