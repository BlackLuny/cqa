After prom, which finishes about 1pm we want to go into the city centre, if that be cabbot circus or park street, just somewhere to eat.   We want it to be reasonably priced and posh enough so we didnt look like we were walking into the corner cafe in prom dresses and suits.      Do you know anywhere?   Please not include chineese or and seafood like sushi lol       Thanks
