The waitress called it atomic salsa but I can not find a recipe for atomic salsa on the internet so I figure it was called something else and the restaurant renamed it for their use. It was a dark green salsa with little chunks of avocado and I think it had halapeno peppers and tomatoes but I am not real sure what the other ingrediants were. I would really like to know what the recipe is so that I can make some at home.

20090225081118AAXyeMF	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	What can I make for someone who likes...?	Hiya!   I made my boyfriend a chocolate cake with chocolate frosting last week and he loved it - my family never say nice things about my cooking (but eat it fast enough so I do know it's good!), but he went on about it for a while - which made me feel really good! So i'd like to make him something else, but different to what I already made. Here are his likes/dislikes:   Likes: Chocolate, butterscotch, toffee and ginger   Dislikes: Fresh cream and jam      I don't really mind what I make (muffins, flapjacks, cake) but different to last time would be good!   Thanks :)

It looks like ginger, but it smells like lemon- really strong lemon!  She said it's also a little on the warm side. Neither of us have ever bought ginger root before, so we're not sure that's what this is. Can anyone tell me what it might be? Some ideas of what to do with it would be great, as well. Recipes if you have them. Thanks!
20090307010526AAHDeKG	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	Vegan friendly protein powder?	From what I have seen, most people recommend around 1.2-1.8 * your body weight (body weight in kgs) of protein (in grams) per day while the recommendation for bodybuilders seems to be as high as your body weight in pounds in protein (so If you weigh 170 pounds you need 170 grams of protein a day). I was wondering, is there a vegan friendly protein powder out there that I could use? Also, I see calcium fortified products all the time... Are there protein fortified vegan friendly products out there as well? If you can answer any of my questions, please include information such as brand names or links to make it easier for me to locate these products.      PS: I posted this in another section and was told it may be better suited to this section so I reposted.      Thanks in advance,

Even if these are going to be refrigerated from when they were made until they go on the trip on Monday i'm not sure they are going to be safe to eat (not to mention having a texture like cardboard!).  I do not want my child eating these sandwiches but can not find specific information regarding length of time these can be stored etc.  Any advice please?

I use this huge water bottle everyday so it can't be anything small. Any ideas?
