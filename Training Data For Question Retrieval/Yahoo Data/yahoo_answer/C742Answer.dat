sP98NDi5aa	For cooked vegetables, it is the one way to retain as many of the vitamins and nutrients that can get leeched from cooking. Also, it is a little harder to overcook them.|`|nDxfUHFLaa	making steamed vegetables is a way to melt the butter that makes them tasty. Have you ever tried to melt butter on Raw vegetables. It takes forever. Steaming softens the vegetable a bit for those wishing less strain on their teeth. and steaming is typically promoted as the alternative healthy way of eating cooked vegetables(as opposed to Boiled) or Oiled.|`|O0AfxH9Eaa	More vitamins, better colour, more flavour. And a tiny bit of butter isn't going to kill you and it will do wonders for the flavour.|`|oymv7Sk4aa	keeps more nutrients in<br>  and taste yummierrrrrr|`|xFv6LirIaa	It does retain most of the nutrients if not steamed too long.  And veggies just taste better when cooked, hot and buttered.

I actually tested this recipe with both ASDA SmartPrice cider and ASP pork steaks, and the meat just fell off the bones. It makes its own apple sauce, and the gravy from the onion and cider juice is fabulous. And there is no waste.     PORK IN CIDER    Serves 2     INGREDIENTS    250ml of cider  1 apple  1 onion  2 pork chops or steaks    METHOD    Pour the cider into a measuring jug. Peel and core the apple, cut it into thick slices and put them into the cider to stop them going brown. Peel the onion and chop it into tiny pieces.    Put the onion in the bottom of an ovenproof dish with a lid. Put the meat on top. Add the cider. Arrange the apple slices on top of the pork. Put the lid on the dish.     Cook in a preheated oven at 150C, 300F, gas mark 2 for about 2 hours. Check the liquid level from time to time and top it up if it starts to dry out.     ADDITIONS & ALTERNATIVES    Stir 2 heaped teaspoons of gravy granules into the onion and cider left in the dish to make the most delicious gravy.     TIPS    Any cheap cider (that doesnt have the word white in the name) will do. The long, slow cooking in the alcohol tenderises even the cheapest meat.|`|ur3vgbXoaa	Stew or Gulosh.

Especially if by "tenderizer" you mean the mallet that you use to pound out the meat --http://www.jr.com/oxo/pe/OXO_26191/    and not the salt -- http://www.myspicesage.com/meattenderize...    So, use your mallet to pound the meat thinner than it is.  Do this between 1 large sheet of plastic wrap folded over the meat.  Spray meat with a touch of water before laying meat onto the plastic.  Then, pound away.    Season 2 cups flour with salt and pepper and 1 package of Ranch Dressing Mix.    Dip steaks in milk, then flour, then hot oil.  Fry for 10-12 mins or golden brown.

This particular recipe is made with marinated cube steaks.   Ingredients:        * 4 tenderized beef steaks (cube steaks)      * vegetable oil      * season salt      * 2 tablespoons red wine      * 2 cups biscuit mix      * 4 tablespoons butter      * 4 tablespoons olive oil or canola      * season salt and pepper    Preparation:  The night before, put the steaks in a non-metal baking dish in single layer. Wipe them on both sides with an even coating of vegetable oil. Dust them on both sides with a generous amount of seasoned salt. Drizzle each steak with red wine or a marinade. Seal the dish with foil or plastic wrap and refrigerate for 6 to 8 hours. Remove the steaks from the refrigerator, remove to a plate and coat both sides well in the biscuit mix. Set baking dish aside and preheat oven to 375.    Combine the butter with the oil in a large skillet until hot. Brown both sides of each steak until coating is crispy. Transfer steaks back to the same baking dish and cover with foil. Bake at 375 for about 30 minutes.|`|75a97dcf3a9acf1a14e09b9c77e983c1aa	I think they're basically the same, but country fried might use cornmeal, where chicken fried does not.  This seems like lots of work, but I hope it's worth.  I got this from a Southern Cooking site.    Ingredients:        * 2/3 cup flour      * 1 teaspoon salt      * freshly ground pepper      * 2 pounds top round steak, about 1/2" thick, tenderized      * 2 eggs      * 2 tablespoons cream      * 1/2 cup vegetable oil      * 2 cups saltine cracker crumbs, finely crushed      * 1 onion, sliced      * 1/2 cup heavy cream or whipping cream      * 1 3/4 cups chicken broth      * a few dashes Worcestershire sauce, optional      * a dash or a few hot sauce, optional    Preparation:  Mix 1/2 cup of flour with the salt and pepper. Pound the mixture into both sides of the meat with the edge of a heavy plate or mallet. Cut the meat into serving-size pieces. Beat the eggs together with the cream. Heat the oil in a heavy skillet over medium high heat. Reserve 3 tablespoons of the flour. Dredge the steaks in the remaining flour, dip in the egg mixture, and then into the cracker crumbs. Add to the hot oil. Brown the steaks well, turning to brown both sides. Reduce heat to medium, cover the skillet, and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, turning occasionally, until the steaks are cooked through and tender. the chicken-fried steak or country fried steaks should be well done, but not dry. Remove the steaks from the pan, and drain on paper towels or brown paper. Keep warm. Add the onion slices to the pan and saut until tender. Remove onions and keep warm with steaks.    Pour off all but 3 tablespoons of the fat in the skillet; stir in 3 tablespoons of the flour. Stir well and scrape bottom of pan to loosen browned bits. Stir in the cream, then the chicken broth. Season with Worcestershire and hot sauce. Top the meat with the gravy.  Serve with mashed potatoes, greens, and biscuits.  4 to 6 Servings

The longer and slower you cook lamb shanks the better.  Just add a bit of liquid to the casserole and keep the lid on.  It will create its own steam and add to the moisture and will not dry out.  To brown simply take off lid and whack up the heat!
3YduZ8Q1aa	Season with pepper, fry in a pan the 1 inch thick slice for a minute each side then put it into the oven (300 F) for about 7 min. - covered.    For the sauce: use the residue of the meat in the fryingpan. put some butter in it, spoon of onion chopped, add the peppers, fry, add some cognac, burn it, add some flour (tspoon), mutard de dijon, ketchup, beefstock ( 2oz.), and cream (2oz.), salt , and simmer till it thickens: staying on the back of the spoon!  Ready:)|`|AA12349214	To cook steaks you have to have the pan really hot so that it sears the outside of the steak almost immediately and seals it.  Cook each side for a minute and then turn.  Cook for a further minute turning each side and then serve.  The sauce is easy.  Make a roux using flour and butter in a saucepan, add a bit of french mustard and crushed peppercorns and simmer gently.  Pour over the steak.  Easy.|`|hT7BhNamaa	David, this is where I cheat. If it's a good thick sirloin, I roll it it freshly crushed black pepper, season with sea salt. with a little EVOO in my cast iron skillet I give the steak no more than 4 minutes each side. on high, I am searing the outside to seal in the juices. I let my meat rest before I carve it to keep it juicy. As for the gravy I make a beef gravy on the side, and all the scrapings in the pan I add them to the gravy or sauce. Give that a try non of my people have complained. i do the same when I use the BBQ..    Chris|`|0VHolTVEaa	You can cook steak rare, meduim or well done depending on your preference. I make my own homemade sauce using peppercorns grinded cook in single cream and i add spices.|`|uAEVGCu1aa	Get a thick cut quality steak  Allow the grill to get to full temperature.   Season one side of the steak with a little salt, black pepper and a smearing of butter.  Cook on full heat for three minutes.  Turn the steak - add more butter and seasoning if you want - cook for three minutes. Turn the grill down to medium.  Turn the steak Again and cook for another 2-3 minutes.  Turn again and cook for another 2-3 minutes.     For peppercorn sauce, fry some finely chopped onions and mushrooms in a bit of butter with some garlic. Add the peppercorns and cook for a few minutes.I would add some double cream, maybe a splash of sherry (or brandy) and some ground black pepper. Bring to the boil and reduce to a simmer.|`|x3rqmwrNaa	First and foremost it's important to keep the pan hot. Seal the steak by cooking it for about a minute to a minute and half on each side so that it turns brown on the outside. If you are unsure you can always cut it open to check where you will see that it should have retained the reddish colour on the inside.    Another tip to make a steak really, really tender is to marinate it overnight in bourbon whiskey. The alcohol tenderizes the meat so that it will melt in your mouth and gives it a great flavor.     As for peppercorn sauce, Apologies but I tried to make my own once and it didn't turn out very well; however there are some good recipes around on the internet - this is just one of them:     http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/databa...     (Obviously if you are only making the sauce then leave out the rest because this is a recipe for steak and stuffed peppers with peppercorn sauce).     Personally if I am grilling steak I like to save the juices and mix those with a tablespoon and a half of creme fraiche and a touch of ground black pepper to make a simple but very tasty sauce.|`|QWN8KNCPaa	heat your frying pan till really hot,place in steak turn to seal both sides,cook for approx 1minute on each side depending on the thickness of the steak,remove steak from heat,add small drop of brandy to pan juices,flame add cracked and whole black peppercorn,then add  double cream reduce till required thickness of sauce required,pour sauce over steak|`|v40ELyB5aa	Cook the steaks a couple of minutes each side but make sure they aren't TOO bouncy and that the frying pan is searingly hot !    For the sauce, my mum's been making me this source since I can remember, just use the same pan you've just cooked the steak in (preserves the flavour from the cooked steak fat) and pour in some double cream, a knob of salted butter, crushed black peppercorns and a devilishly generous splash of brandy, then just stir like crazy until it's melted and is slightly beige in colour.     Serve with chips or dauphinoise and ENJOY .    Am now off to go make myself some steak...lol .
829070aea711a47d99d908ff132df3bbaa	Basically you want an Alfredo sauce with bacon.  That's all it really is.    Cook and chop your bacon and add it to the Alfredo sauce after it's done( I also add frozen peas( it adds a great flavor and color to the dish).    http://www.recipezaar.com/Olive-Garden-G...|`|8bh0IGwJaa	You really cannot taste "egg" in the cream sauce for carbonara, but if even the thought bothers you, just make a cream sauce and add bacon.     So, instead of 4 large eggs use 1.5 cups heavy cream.|`|hT7BhNamaa	Tim K, Have no idea where you got that recipe from, but I do Carbonara all the time. As Alison suggested use cooking cream. Actually I use Panccetta same as bacon, but I thick it enhances the flavor a lot more than bacon.    There is my two cents worth.    Chris|`|vcgn6XZgaa	Substitute cream - it will be fine.|`|53giV6PFaa	I agree with Alison.  However, I have made carbonaras many times and you cannot taste the egg at all. It really adds a great taste to the sauce, you should really try it with the eggs.|`|432d817139a5e0be18e400a33e0e1908aa	Do the Anglo-American version (which is similar to an Alfredo sauce) ...    CARBONARA SAUCE     Enough for pasta for 2     INGREDIENTS     4 slices of cooked ham     100g of closed cup mushrooms  2 cloves of garlic  1 onion  1 tablespoon of olive oil  1 tablespoon of flour  150ml carton of single cream  1 teaspoon of mixed herbs  Ground pepper to taste    METHOD    Cut the ham into 1cm (? inch) pieces. Wipe the mushrooms clean. Cut the ends off the stalks and chop them into slices. Peel the garlic and chop it into tiny pieces. Peel the onion and chop it into tiny pieces.     Put the oil into a frying pan on a medium heat. Add the onion and garlic. Cook for a couple of minutes until the onion has gone soft. Stir frequently to stop it sticking. Add the mushrooms, stir and cook for a couple more minutes. Add the flour and stir until it has absorbed the oil and juices in the pan. Add the cream, ham and herbs. Season with the pepper. Stir and cook for about a minute until it has made a smooth sauce.     ADDITIONS & ALTERNATIVES    Use bacon or a gammon steak, cut into 1cm (? inch) pieces and added at the same time as the onion and garlic, instead of the cooked ham.     Use button mushrooms instead of closed cup mushrooms. Dont use open cup mushrooms, as the brown underside discolours the sauce.     Use crme fra?che instead of the cream.     TIPS    A dairy-based sauce like this should traditionally be served with long, thin egg pasta, like tagliatelle. However, it is also served with long, thin plain pasta, like spaghetti.    Always take the pasta to the sauce. Put the pasta in the pan with the sauce and stir together until thoroughly coated.     HISTORICAL NOTES     This dish was unknown before the Second World War, when many Italians were eating eggs and bacon supplied by the Allied troops. It also became popular with the Allied troops stationed in Italy. Upon their return home, they tried to recreate the dish, but somehow it lost the eggs and gained the cooked ham, cream sauce and mushrooms. Meanwhile, the Italians kept it simple and just substituted the bacon for home produced pancetta.|`|YNVGYRKTaa	OH!!! i like to eat carbonara!! BUT!! with eggs!! dat;s sucks!!!    OH!! gudluck!!!|`|a4e971e4ecd5f35c24d665e6dc1d67cbaa	You can omit them entirely or substitute heavy cream. The real carbonara (means black pepper) does mot have eggs. Use a good smoke bacon and add 2-3 shallots minced

In a way, it's "letting your hair down".  It's being "earthy", lighthearted, free spirit.    Drinking directly from the bottle, using fingers while eating chicken, etc. . . .That's more of a big deal for those who are more "proper" and are allowing themself to just relax.    To some drinking directly from the bottle is seen same as eating directly from a can of soup, eating right out of the cooking pot . . .rather than first putting on serving plate.    Those of English heritage have more tendency to be "proper" as that's part of their culture.  It's a bigger deal for them to serve and eat in "proper" manner...including bottled beverages.    The person who made that statement to you had English accent.  The English have more tendency to being "proper" and increased focus on etiquette and manners.  That's part of their base culture.  So, a person with English accent making that comment . . .that might explain reason behind their statement.    Those times when I do drink directly out of the bottle is generally when I'm with friends enjoying outdoor bar-b-que, after a day hike, on a picnic, summer evenings out on pateo.

Looks cool or whatever...    When I lived in England, guys had no problem having their pints served in a glass whatsoever.

Add a little Irishy thing too...    In North America..not sure..there aren't pubs here or rarely any but in   groups, socialising  etc..I have noticed that guys did that.

Well...I suppose you could make the comparison with teens opening cans of coke and drink straight from the bottle instead of pouring it into a glass..

For instance, light beers typically taste better out of the bottle than if poured into a glass.  This would be a good reason to drink out of the bottle.  Also a bottle can be more convenient especially when at a crowded bar, because you can carry the bottle around easily with out the fear of spillage when someone knocks into you because you can keep your thumb over the mouth of the bottle.|`|5mXeHYYlaa	I started drinking beer from a bottle when I first visited Thailand in 1990. By far the largest majority of tourists drink from the bottle in preference to a glass. The bottles are placed inside a polystyrene tube which keeps the beer cold a great deal longer than if it were in a glass.|`|HBK9aIhxaa	- Because the neck of a bottle is narrow, it helps prevent the beer being drunk too quickly (ie lasts a bit longer)     - bottles are usually kept in fridges so the glass bottle itself is colder than just a glass kept at room temperature which is then filled with cold beer    - You are at less risk of contamination or spillage    - With bottles you are pretty much guaranteed consistancy of quality, as opposed to visiting bars where the draft taps don't get cleaned properly    - With a bottle the beer gets agitated more (swills around more) thus preserving a "just poured" sensation that often disappears half way through drinking a glass of beer.     - It does look cool, someone who drinks straight from the bottle gives the impression of being casual, rebelling against formal norms of how to drink beer 'properly'|`|f7f1dbd297b05e58dcc42220734cebb4aa	Although I prefer a nice fine glass to drink my beer or wine, when in a crowded bar I like to think drinking from a bottle keeps more germs out of my beer especially during the winter when there is a lot of people coughing and sneezing around me.

hHCdXq0Naa	I've never heard of a chiffon pan, but chiffon cakes are usually baked in Angel Food Cake or tube pans.  Bundt cakes also have a hole in the middle, but are shaped into ridges or other designs (I have a rose, a chrysanthemum, heart, wreath and some others).  Angel Food cake pans are taller, flat sides and a flat bottom.  You can bake bundt cakes in Angel Food cake pans, but can't bake an Angel Food or chiffon cake in a bundt pan (it would get stuck in the folds, since you NEVER grease the pan for those cakes).  Angel Food and Chiffon cakes need an UNgreased pan, so the light batter can "climb" up the sides.  Also, there are usually little feet on AF pans, so you can turn them upside down to cool the cake|`|AA11394457	The Bundt pan makes a pattern on the cake surface, while the chiffon pan is plain/has straight sides.|`|AA10928232	Bundt is a trademark name that usually has scallops on it, sort of dividing the cake into thick and thin "slices" when you look at it.

O0AfxH9Eaa	It does depend on the pie. My mum's steak and butterbean pie is to die for.|`|Q4oPyclQaa	Because the filling has sugar and the crust has fat, which are two things that humans LOVE to eat.  We like sugar because it's associated with fruits, which are nutritious and was one of our ancestor's major parts of their diet, and fats are required for our huge brains.<br>  <br>  In normal circumstances, both things were difficult to find and it was advantageous for us to be attracted to food with fat and sugar.  But now that we have fatty and sugarry foods at our fingertips whenever we like, we overconsume and it's bad for us.<br>  <br>  That's why we like pie. :)|`|AA11765580	because it's all sugary and fruity|`|AA10930398	Because its usually sweet and there is something in your brain that says 'umm sweet.. thats good.."  so it  triggers your body to crave sweets if you have them regularly. Just the sight or smell can trigger this. I'm not a scientist but in laymans terms this is just about what happens. I'm not quiet sure  how to make this stop but when I remove sugar from my diet for as long as I can it helps 'curb' that craving...and pie just doesn't seem that interesting, but  after about 3 weeks I'm craving  sugar like mad. So I have some.

Almond butter is definitely healthier. :)   Cheese has a lot of protein (21grams) and it makes a good quick snack. Hope this helps!|`|VrzX3mWsaa	For nutritional properties go to this link  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nut_butter    Almonds are high in monounsaturated fats, which are considered to be a healthier form of fat than saturated fat. They are an excellent source of Vitamin E, magnesium, & fiber. They contain monosaturated fat, protein,potassium, calcium, phosphorus and iron.      Actually, Almonds are the only nut that is categorized as very alkaline.  All other nuts are well into the acidic foods category.  And almonds are very high in alkalinity, which means they have an electrical charge that is similar to our bodies.  Alkaline foods are very good for you and will increase your metabolism, give you lasting energy, help you from getting sick, etc.  Acidic foods do the opposite.  Almond butter and it's healthy fat is far better for you than any other nut butter.  They stats on the containers may look the same, but what's inside is very different.|`|AA11765933	with all the problems with Peanut Butter these days I would go with Almond Butter|`|P6r2In1Iaa	I guess because it isn't so mass produced I'd believe it to be healthier for that reason alone and I once read that the protein found in almonds helps fight obesity.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Nutritionally they are about equal, although almond butter is more costly.I find almond butter more tasty, and it doesn't stick to the palate like peanut butter.

So I vote for almond butter.|`|vcgn6XZgaa	Pretty much the same - the difference is so negligible, it would not be worth worrying about!|`|16e730ba39930a9906b368149bb74bbfaa	Almonds are much healthier than peanuts.    Peanuts are often stale, if not moldy when they are processed into peanut butter.    Almond butter also doesn't contain lard or cheap vegetable oil like most peanut butter does.|`|fZnuyKSZaa	here is some information about almond butter.  http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-almond-b...

AA11907123	Depends what you mean by "chili"...in New Mexico they insist that the word refers to the chile peppers which are used to flavor the dish...not the meat-and-beans combination people think of.

Mostly consisting of black beans and beef stewed with the hot peppers that are abundant in the country of Chile. They also served hot sake with it.

AA11015885	Creme fraiche is pronounced 'krem fresh'.  It is a thick and smooth soured cream with a rich and velvety texture.  This matured cream has a nutty, slightly sour taste produced by culturing pasteurized cream with a special bacteria.  (However, in France where it originated, the cream is unpasteurized so it naturally contains the bacteria necessary to make creme fraiche.)  The butterfat content does vary (usually 30%), as there is no set standard so you will find every brand tastes a little differently.  <br>  <br>  The Creme fraiche found in specialty food stores and some grocery stores in North America is pasteurized and the only problem with buying it is its price; it is ridiculously expensive.  So much so that you may want to try making your own.  It really is quite simple; all you do is gently heat heavy whipping cream (contains 36 - 40% butterfat) and then stir in some buttermilk.  This mixture is left to sit, slightly covered, in a warm draught-free place for around 24 hours.  It is ready when it is thick, with the consistency of thick cream.  If it still looks a little runny after 24 hours, leave it another 8 to 12 hours but move it to a warmer spot.  And don't worry about the cream going bad.  Regan Daly in her book 'In the Sweet Kitchen' tells us that "the benign live bacteria in the buttermilk will multiply and protect the cream from any harmful bacteria".  Once the creme fraiche has thickened sufficiently, cover and place in the refrigerator.  It will continue to thicken and take on a more tangy flavor as it ages.  Creme fraiche will keep in the refrigerator for about 7-10 days.  It is used in both savory and sweet dishes and makes a wonderful topping for fresh berries, cobblers and puddings.  It can also be whipped, along with a little sugar, and used in place of whipped heavy cream.|`|c8d511b57b38b8ff3a19d1b90168fef3aa	Crème fra?che French for "fresh cream"), of French origin, is the Western European counterpart to the soured cream.  If you can't find it, use sour cream|`|53giV6PFaa	Crème fra?che is a manufactured cream product with between 18 percent and 36 percent fat. It has a smooth thick texture, similar to cream cheese but it has a slightly tangy flavour more akin to Sour Cream.<br>  <br>  Origin and History<br>  Originating in the Brittany and Normandy regions of France it is widely available and used throughout Europe. In France, the unique characteristics of crème fra?che made by different artisan producers is greatly appreciated in much the same way as connoisseurs appreciate and enjoy different types of yoghurt.<br>  <br>  It is traditionally made with unpasturised cream which naturally contains the bacteria required to thicken it, but whilst specialists still use unpasturised cream, pasturised cream is becoming more widely used.<br>  <br>  Crème Fra?che in Cooking<br>  Many cooks favour crème fra?che over cream and sour cream because it can be boiled, reduced and thickened without the risk of curdling. It can also be whipped like double cream and has a longer shelf-life than both cream and sour cream. Crème fra?che can used as a substitute for sour cream in most recipes and for cream in many.<br>  <br>  It makes a great topping for fresh fruits, puddings and other desserts. It is also an excellent ingredient in savory dishes such as soups and casseroles, and adds richness and body to sauces.|`|InvPKVJ7aa	It's a richer version of a sour cream like product.   You can use sour cream as a substitute in your recipe if you can't find the real thing|`|yB8djbeNaa	you should be able to get it in the supermarket near the yogurt and cheese or sour cream is similar but would need wipping to make it slightly thicker|`|AA11589437	just whipping cream!|`|9mwEu0Afaa	Creme Fraiche: In a medium saucepan over low heat, warm the cream to 105 degrees F (40 degrees C). Remove from heat and stir in the buttermilk. Transfer the cream to a large bowl and allow this mixture to stand in a warm place, loosely covered with plastic wrap, until thickened but still of pouring consistency.  Stir and taste every 6 - 8 hours. This process takes anywhere from 24 to 36 hours, depending on your room temperature.  The creme fraiche is ready when it is thick with a slightly nutty sour taste.  Chill cream, in the refrigerator, for several hours before using. Creme fraiche may be made and stored in the refrigerator for up to 10 days. <br>  <br>  Creme Fraiche Frosting:  <br>  <br>  In bowl of electric mixer, with whisk attachment, beat the Creme Fraiche with 1-2 tablespoons (14-28 grams) of granulated white sugar until stiff peaks form.  Can be used in desserts instead of whipped cream.<br>  <br>  <br>   Recipe:<br>  <br>  1 cup (240 ml) heavy whipping cream <br>  <br>  1 tablespoon buttermilk<br>  <br>  Note:  If possible, use pasteurized heavy whipping cream, as ultra pasteurized will take longer to thicken.

BXRMWJw8aa	Since you live in TX I know HEB carries it. If not most stores carry it, if you can not wait for it to be mailed from online. You can use the short cut method… <br>  buy any jam (flavor) then just get the fruit. What you then do is that you put the jam and the fruit together and you may need to cook it down for about 10 min adding water so it does not stick. Total prep time should be about 15 min.<br>   if the recipe is going to cook the chutney longer, you can completely pass this step. <br>  Then you can adjust the flavor, with what ever you have in your house.

The collective number of clients in the area must be divided by the number of cafées - the more cafées, the less customers per café.<br>  <br>  Of course they won't giver you their numbers - and I wouldn't trust them, if they did. You could be from the tax-services, in which case they would want to underestimate the number. You could be looking to buy their café, in which casees they might want to overestimate the number. And finally you could be from an actual competing café, which could merit all kinds of strategic conciderations ..<br>  <br>  You will just have to pick some times during the day, where you count the number of people in each café.

BWxSSADaaa	Burritos are a food you eat with your hands, pretty much.  A (usually large) flour tortilla filled with whatever you want: beans, meat, salsa, lettuce, cheese, etc, etc.    Enchiladas: tortillas wrapped around usually a single filling (seasoned meat, cheese, spinach) placed in a shallow dish, and baked with a sauce and usually cheese on top.  They're usually served with refried beans and rice on the side.  Fancier versions exist that have more than one filling, but it's never as varied as a burrito.    Fajitas: Grilled meat (beef, chicken or shrimp, generally) served with onions and peppers that have been cooked in a very hot cast iron skillet.  In restaurants, its served with the meat, onions and peppers still in the hot skillet.  This is accompanied by tortillas (your choice, flour or corn), cheese, pico de gallo, guacamole, sour cream.  You build your own soft tacos with everything.  Usually also served with rice and beans.    Chimichanga: basically a deep fried burrito.    Wraps: Like a burrito, but kind of fancier and not necessarily tex-mex.  They may involve flavored tortillas (spinach, sun dried tomato, etc), and fillings can be anything (tandoori chicken for an Indian wrap, satay chicken for a Thai one, etc)    I love enchiladas.  My favorites are chicken enchiladas with mol sauce, or spinach and cheese with tomatillo sauce.|`|GWQ0uZyeaa	Burritos are prepared with flour tortillas and already cooked ingredients, then rolled up and served, sometimes with a sauce on top. Enchiladas are flour or corn tortillas, filled with cooked ingredients, rolled and placed in a baking dish, sauce on top and baked to warm. Fajitas are served as separate cooked ingredients and you fill, roll/build them yourself at the table with sides of guacamole, sour cream, pico de gallo to garnish. Chimichangas are filled, then deep fried.  They are all good; it's more a matter of preference.|`|Yt8mQK5Iaa	Burrito - A flour torilla wrapped or folded around a filling. The torilla is usually lightly grilled or steamed to make it softer.     Enchilda - Corn tortilla rolled around a filling with a chilli pepper sauce.    Fajita - Grilled meat served on a flour or corn tortilla.     Chimichanga - Deep fried burrito. Typically prepared by folding a flour tortilla into a rectangular package and filling it with a variety of ingredients.

I added some butter and spices and mix them in.  Maple syrup is also good.  You can also make some long grain rice and fill the squash with it.  As for crock pot recipes, I have peeled an acorn squash, cut it up and put it in the crock pot with veggie broth and other veggies.  The house smells great when I get home.  The squash is easier to peel and cut if you put in the micro for 30-45 seconds.|`|c4058327d20f41accfd1c3c424c72f6faa	Chop it up into chunks, coat with olive oil and chopped garlic, bake in the oven until it's ready (soft).<br>  <br>  Works every time.

Then, cut it up into pieces and throw it in the steamer. Mash it with some soy milk, butter, garlic, and salt and pepper and that makes a great mashed  squash.<br>  <br>  Or, cut it into strips and cover with olive oil, salt, and pepper and bake it on high temperatures for about 20 minutes. Baked squash fries! Or, sautee it with some garlic and olive oil.<br>  <br>  You could even stuff it with a fun rice or couscous sautee and bake it with that inside.|`|UM8EFzIMaa	Cut it in half and clean out the seeds. Put facedown on a baking sheet and roast at 325 degrees until the flesh is soft. Then eat it as is or add some butter and either brown sugar or maple syrup to the cavity.|`|b9uOax0aaa	We usually baked them  I like the taste of butternut better though.

DsqQs5yqaa	i wouldn't pull out your ovary and call it a fetus<br>  it's not an embryo 'till it's fertilized - the eggs you buy in the store aren't<br>  <br>  here ya go: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(food)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(food)</a><br>  read up|`|YTasscmKaa	The yoke is the food the embryo uses for nutrition while its growing in the egg.|`|07402bcc6087c522e1be5f950a5e9ba8aa	No that is the food for the embryo. If you saw an embryo it would be on the surface of that yolk. Eggs you find in the store are never fertilized ones (which would require a male and a female just like for any other baby-making) .<br>  <br>  Here's a site with an embryo showing in the egg <a href="http://chickscope.beckman.uiuc.edu/resources/egg_to_chick/coloring.html" rel="nofollow">http://chickscope.beckman.uiuc.edu/resou...</a>|`|M07pTI5Taa	eggs that are commonly eaten like the one you are describing is an unfertilized egg, so no your not eating a baby chicken, i get asked this all the time because I'm a vegetarian... however in some countries they do eat fertilized eggs and when you crack the egg open its like a little dead baby bird :-( saw it on bizarre foods with Andrew Zimmermen(sp?) (travel channel) <br>  i think this is nasty but the way i describe it to my family is, it's like a chicken's period lol<br>  hope this helped :-)|`|WSIZKAQcaa	liquid chicken|`|GhsqaXsdaa	you make it sound so nasty D: lol|`|c2uywBsIaa	it sure is...|`|AA10093245	No, it's not the embryo. the hens that lay eggs for the supermarket have never even seen a rooster so they are not laying fertile eggs. Hens lay eggs without being with a rooster, the same way girls shed an egg and have a period without being with a man. Only if it's fertilized will it begin to develop into an embryo.<br>  No need to worry about eating a baby chick, unless you raise chickens, have a rooster, and the hen has already been setting on her eggs for a period of time. Hens lay up to 30 eggs before they even begin to set, so even if it's fertilized, it's the continual warmth of her body  during setting that begins the process, that way all the eggs hatch at roughly the same time.|`|r2bbLMUZaa	Think back to sex education.<br>  <br>  The egg there is the same as your monthly egg.<br>  <br>  The only difference is that growth takes place outside the body of the mother.<br>  <br>  When you eat an egg, you are boiling and consuming a foetus complete with placenta.<br>  <br>  It isn't an embryo because edible eggs are not inseminated. They are the equivalent of a period.|`|74dfcb1be61ec91aea7144815438e380aa	the white are the proteins that would have become a chicken and the yolk is the nutrient sac that would provide energy for that chicken to form inside the egg.|`|sqR0iyuWaa	No, there was no embryo because it was unfertilized. Its like the egg that you pass when you're not pregnant. The embryo uses the yolk for nutrients- eats it, in a way.|`|AA11464317	Yolk in an egg is the food the embryo consumes while growing.|`|JQZzI49Paa	*exactly*|`|ODvnyAdlaa	its protein and the unborn feotus of the chiken x|`|RN0zRPH4aa	ewww|`|DCnithMkaa	An egg is a round or oval body laid by the female of many animals, consisting of an ovum surrounded by layers of membranes and an outer casing, which acts to nourish and protect a developing embryo and its nutrient reserves. Most edible eggs, including bird eggs and turtle eggs, consist of a protective, oval eggshell, the albumen (egg white), the vitellus (egg yolk), and various thin membranes. Every part is edible, although the eggshell is generally discarded. Nutritionally, eggs are considered a good source of protein and choline.|`|g9l8ed4qaa	no of the egg is fertilized the white part becomes the chick and it is attached to the yolk by am umbilical cord. This is what the chick live on while it grows and 3 days after it is hatched.|`|5f4417e367f9ccdb37377de23642463daa	Depends on the egg......I prefer the plastic ones you get at Easter time.

53giV6PFaa	I would do one of the following since they have different taste:    Chili - make a topping bar - with diced onions, sour cream, shredded cheese, etc. and let your guest create their own chili "creation".  Serve with some cornbread.    Lasagna - serve with some garlic bread and nice tossed salad and like the chili - make your own salad buffet and let guest create their own salads with different dressing options.      Burgers - serve with some oven-baked fries and like the other two do a topping bar so that they can make their burgers to their liking.    Have fun!!!|`|vXzqImKZaa	For this time of year when its chilly out I would go with a taco soup its an all time favorite at my home when I have guest over. Plus you fix in in a slow cooker gives you plenty of time to get other things done before they arrive.    2 pounds ground beef   2 cups diced onions   2 (15 1/2-ounce) cans pinto beans   1 (15 1/2-ounce) can pink kidney beans   1 (15 1/4-ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained   1 (14 1/2-ounce) can Mexican-style stewed tomatoes   1 (14 1/2-ounce) can diced tomatoes   1 (14 1/2-ounce) can tomatoes with chiles   2 (4 1/2-ounce) cans diced green chiles   1 (4.6-ounce) can black olives, drained and sliced, optional   1/2 cup green olives, sliced, optional   1 (1 1/4-ounce) package taco seasoning mix   1 (1-ounce) package ranch salad dressing mix   Corn chips, for serving   Sour cream, for garnish   Grated cheese, for garnish   Chopped green onions, for garnish   Pickled jalapenos, for garnish   Directions  Brown the ground beef and onions in a large skillet; drain the excess fat, then transfer the browned beef and onions to a large slow cooker or a stockpot. Add the beans, corn, tomatoes, green chiles, black olives, green olives, taco seasoning, and ranch dressing mix, and cook in a slow cooker on low for 6 to 8 hours or simmer over low heat for about 1 hour in a pot on the stove. To serve, place a few corn chips in each bowl and ladle soup over them. Top with sour cream, cheese, green onions and jalapenos.|`|IpkUUxdNaa	Any of those sound fine; you could also make sloppy joes; tacos; burittos; nachos; or just make burgers  good luck and i'm sure everyone will like whatever you make|`|CvYq5wBhaa	I think it depends on the "feeling" that you're going for--if you really want everyone to sit around the table, then maybe lasagna or meatloaf would be best (if you're on a budget, remember side dishes, too...for lasagna all you would need is a bag of salad and a loaf of bread). If you want to roam or eat someplace other than the dining room table, chili is a great choice.|`|KIfkzdIJaa	Chili if it's cold, burgers if you're having beers, lasagna if you're having wine.  :)    Or, you could always do Shepherd's pie with ground beef (instead of lamb), too, as that's always a hit.

7uCfW237aa	Pressure cookers work because under normal conditions the water used would evaporate away. In a pressure cooker there is no room for the water to evaporate so no water is lost and subsequently no heat is lost. This allows you to reach much higher temperatures when cooking with food which uses or contains water.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|XcNoptFbaa	I've been married for 48 years and I've had a pressure cooker that long and it's wonderful.

53giV6PFaa	Here is a recipe for a good custard danish.  Just replace the pastry recipe for thawed puff pastry dough.  Everything else the same in the recipe.<br>  <br>  DANISH PUFFS  <br>  <br>  1/2 c. butter, softened<br>  1 c. flour<br>  2 tsp. water<br>  <br>  Oven at 350 degrees. Bake 30 minutes.<br>  <br>  Pastry: Cut butter into flour. Sprinkle water over and mix. Pat dough into 3 inch circles.<br>  <br>  CUSTARD:<br>  <br>  1/2 c. butter<br>  1 c. water<br>  1 tsp. almond extract<br>  1 c. flour<br>  3 eggs<br>  <br>  Custard: Heat butter and water to rolling boil in medium saucepan.

Cool.<br>  <br>  GLAZE:<br>  <br>  1 1/2 c. confectioners' sugar<br>  2 tbsp. butter<br>  1 1/2 tsp. vanilla<br>  1 to 2 tbsp. water<br>  <br>  Frost puffs with glaze and sprinkle with crushed nuts. About 2 dozen pastries.|`|288251fd9000ef121301a956a76145e7aa	Tips for Thawing Pastry Sheets<br>  Remove as many pastry sheets as needed (wrap unused sheets in plastic wrap or foil and return them to the freezer). <br>  Quick thaw: Separate the pastry sheets, covering each one with a piece of plastic wrap. Thaw the sheets at room temperature about 30 minutes. <br>  Refrigerator thaw: Sheets placed in the refrigerator will be ready to use in about four hours and can be held up to two days. A whole package thaws in about six hours. This method is preferred by chefs because the sheets are completely and evenly thawed. <br>  Tips for Shaping Pastry Sheets<br>  Work with one pastry sheet at a time, keeping the others in the refrigerator. <br>  Unfold pastry sheets on a lightly floured board, countertop or pastry cloth. If the pastry becomes too soft, chill it in the refrigerator for a few minutes. <br>  Handle the pastry as little as possible to ensure tenderness. Cut pastry with a sharp utensil such as a knife, pizza wheel or pastry tool. For decorative edges or shapes, use a fluted ravioli cutter or cookie cutters. <br>  Seal filled pastries by brushing a mixture of beaten eggs and water between layers, then pinching or pressing them together. <br>  Many filled pastries can be refrigerated or frozen, then baked just before serving. <br>  For thin, crisp pastries, roll sheets to a 1/4-inch thickness. <br>  Tips for Baking Pastry Sheets<br>  Bake prepared sheets in a preheated conventional oven (not a microwave). About halfway through, check progress by peeking through the oven window or opened door. <br>  Dark glazed baking sheets may bake puff pastry faster; adjust baking time if necessary. <br>  To turn pastries a deep golden-brown, brush tops with a mixture of 1 egg yolk and 1 teaspoon water just before baking. To add a special texture and flavor, sprinkle chopped nuts, seeds, ground spices or grated cheese on top. <br>  For extra-thin, crisp pastry, set a second baking sheet on top of the filled pastry before baking. A lattice pattern can be created by topping the pastry with a metal cooling rack, then turning it at a right angle half way through the baking. <br>  Tips for Working With Pastry Shells<br>  Remove as many pastry shells as needed. Rewrap unused pastry shells in plastic wrap or foil and return to freezer. Place pastry shells on ungreased baking sheets with "top" facing up. Place shells about 2 inches apart on baking sheet. <br>  Always bake pastry shells in a preheated 400°F oven. <br>  Do not bake shells in a microwave or a toaster oven. <br>  Bake shells about 20 to 25 minutes until golden brown. Use a fork to remove "top" and soft pastry underneath. Return shells to oven 3 to 5 minutes for extra crispness. The top works well as a garnish. <br>  Unfilled baked shells may be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. <br>  To recrisp shells, place them in a 400°F oven for 5 minutes.|`|SEESSQBlaa	Too many varieties to describe here. Study the ones that you like and you should be able to work out how they are put together. Glazes are usually warmed apricot jam which is brushed on after baking. Often a little water icing is thinly spun or brushed on too. Bakers generally use "bakers custard" which has no substitute in the kitchen, so you will have to improvise.

2RzEaod9aa	Lol, "how do I cook grass?!?!?" That's classic. :)<br>  <br>  Think about everything you normally cook.<br>  Now delete the eggs, dairy, and meat from that menu. <br>  <br>  There are a lot of things that easily translate to vegan, like chili. Just remove the meat, right? Easy enough. However, I love nutrients and texture, so I like to add things in. Crushed tomatoes, various beans, fire roasted green chilies...those are pretty standard. I also toss in polenta. That stuff is deeeelish. It's an Italian food that's basically cornmeal + water, and is packaged. It's somewhat solid, and is great for baking, grilling, frying, or tossing into your chili. <br>  <br>  Things that you may consider a side, like roasted veggies, beans and rice, etc., can easily be made into a main course. Just bulk it up with additional ingredients and make it really tasty with all those seasonings you have in your pantry (check the blends for animal products, some add cheese or meat flavorings) and you're set.|`|vGhhoQQkaa	Give him toast and beans with fake cheese and some fried onions.<br>  <br>  Make sure the beans are from the health shop.<br>  <br>  That would be the way to my heart...although I'm female.<br>  <br>  LOL<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  p.s. just google vegan and you will get LOADS of recipes simple ones too vegan cooking isn't hard and you don't need to worry about undercooking meat!!!|`|64554a8e1157e502654f643d0ffe309baa	LOL @ Cooking grass. :)<br>  <br>  Actually vegan cooking can be quite fun. <a href="http://www.theppk.com/recipes/" rel="nofollow">http://www.theppk.com/recipes/</a> has a lot of great recipe ideas.|`|7zJ2T8dxaa	Oh dear...don't panic.  We're not aliens!  What kind of thing would you like to make?  Italian?  Asian?  Soup?  Think about what you'd like to make if he were "normal" (*sigh*).  <br>  <br>  Would you make him stew?  Look up vegan stew--use everything you would normally use, except sear some seitan first in place of the beef, and use an onion or mushroom broth as a base.  <br>  <br>  Chili?  Tons of recipes out there for vegan chili (sautee onions/garlic/peppers/carrots, add beans and seasonings, cook for a while, add tomatoes/tomato paste, cook for a while more, add more seasonings to taste) and cornbread.  <br>  <br>  What about stir-fry?  Veggie stir-fry is quick and easy, and you can get some cool noodles (rice/buckwheat) to mix it up, and maybe even a seaweed salad (but check the ingredients if you buy it pre-made, some have jellyfish).  <br>  <br>  Lasagna?  Look online for vegan lasagna recipes--I do WONDERFUL things with crumbled tofu and nutritional yeast as the ricotta (layers= sauce, noodles, sauce, pre-cooked veggies, mashed tofu/nutritional yeast/thawed frozen spinach and herbs, noodles, sauce).  Serve that with a baby spinach salad with a raspberry vinaigrette...yum!  <br>  <br>  If you do venture into the realm of "fake" meats and cheeses, try not to rely to heavily on them--he'll appreciate your effort and creativity to make him food, not just replicate meat dishes.  Also, read the lables, and make sure they say they are vegan--a lot of cheeses, especially, have casein which is a milk product that helps them melt.  "Follow your heart" brand cheeses are good, maybe grate some mozzarella on the top of the lasagna?  Some cheddar on the chili?  They have sour cream too, if you go the chili route.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|lL7Sak7Gaa	Just make spaghetti with marinara sauce....and garlic-y bread and salad <br>  <br>  For sauce, here's a very easy recipe:<br>  <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/giada-de-laurentiis/marinara-sauce-recipe2/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/giada...</a><br>  <br>  Noodles: Get whole wheat angel hair, or whatever you want<br>  <br>  Bread: By a loaf of ciabatta, cut thick slices, drizzle with olive oil and put in your toaster over or oven, once toasted, rub a garlic clove all over the bread...or sprinkle with garlic seasoning.<br>  <br>  Salad...easy, just make sure you get a vegan dressing, like Italian.

wVJ4PJJXaa	Being a Cuban from Miami, this is what you gotta have to make the perfect Cuban sandwich: <br>  <br>  Ham<br>  Pork<br>  SWISS CHEESE<br>  mustard (just a bit) <br>  and a pickle<br>  <br>  Cuban bread is a must but I use regular bread when Im in a pinch.|`|ubukt8WWaa	In cuba they make pressed, grilled sandwiches with a variety of ingredients.<br>  <br>  One particular type of "cuban sandwich" was made popular by cuban immigrants in Miami.  It uses swiss cheese.<br>  <br>  From <a href="http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/Sandwiches/CubanSandwich.htm:" rel="nofollow">http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/S...</a><br>  "My fathers name was Frank Garces, but everyone called him by his nickname Paco. I can attest that my father made and sold the first Cuban sandwich in Miami in 1947. My father was born in Palma Soriano, Oriente, Cuba, and he went to New York in 1927. Our family moved to Miami in 1947 when he bought his first bar called Do Drop Inn in northwest Miami, where he also sold sandwich’s, one of them he called the  “Cuban Sandwich.” He made his Cuban sandwiches using cut ham, roasted pork, Swiss cheese, sliced pickle, butter, and yellow mustard. He then pressed the sandwich to heat it."|`|AA11015885	How to make a Sandwich Cubano / Medianoche, with pictures<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  There are many variations on the Cuban Sandwich.  On a traditional Cuban, there should not be any mayonnaise, tomatoes, onions, bell peppers or lettuce.  Although you can use these to your own liking, you will find the authentic traditional recipe below (I've also just added a link to a step-by-step photo description below of how you can make your own Cuban sandwich).  Often times, one can use leftover meats from the fridge for a Cuban, yet I recommend using only the freshest cuts if you plan on serving it hot.  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  The medianoche (my personal favorite) sandwich is sometimes served cold, as its name implies you might eat it very late as a midnight snack or coming back from dancing or a movie.  Some make the medianoche smaller, with a sweeter variety of yellow egg bread (similar to Jewish Challah bread). In making a good Cuban sandwich, remember this: the Roast Pork is what will make the sandwich, so you can never leave it out.  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  3 thin slices of ham <br>  <br>  3 thin slices roast pork hot or cold (I use hot, slow roasted pork) <br>  <br>  3 thin slices of Swiss cheese <br>  <br>  3 or 4 slices of pickles <br>  <br>  1/3 cut Cuban bread hard crust (or French bread)<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  You should be using fresh, crusty Cuban bread, but you can always use a 12" loaf of French bread cut in half.  Slice the bread open face so that both halves are still barely connected and spread mustard on both halves.  Add the ham, and then the roasted pork.  When in a hurry, you can use one whole piece of roasted pork.  Add your Swiss cheese and then a few pickle slices.  Make sure to spray your sandwich press with a little butter flavored Pam, or for a tastier sandwich you can brush some softened butter on the outside of the bread.  Place the sandwich in a Cuban sandwich press and press down until the cheese is melted and the bread is slightly hard to the touch.  For those of you without a press, you can also place the sandwich in a hot skillet and press down on it with a heavy kitchen object, maybe a baking pan (some, believe it or not, use a brick wrapped in tin foil when nothing else is available).  For years I've used a Gaunaurd sandwich maker from the Cuban Food Market, it has removable plates and is easy to clean.  Never use a panini grill, they simply don't heat sandwiches evenly and a real Cuban doesn't have little lines grilled into it.  When finished, slice the sandwich diagonally across the middle so that you have two triangle shaped wedges (as seen in the pictures at the bottom of this page).  Enjoy!|`|z25aqkDjaa	that must be an old old sanwich-pre you know who.....because i am sure the only sanwich they-unfortunately-can eat now is black bean sanwich.not un fortunately the beans-they are yummy-unfortunately because ..........well we all know.|`|scX6smKVaa	I am off to cuba in a month and cant wait to try the cuban sarnies!!!|`|8lYZROjuaa	I did a little research on this and the only two cheeses mentioned on a Cuban sandwich were swiss and provolone, and they don't sound very Cuban to me!<br>  Sorry.

So you can't even trust that other parents are watching out for her!  If she's already drinking she may already be having sex too Mom!  WAKE UP and keep your eyes open, and don't believe a word she tells you!|`|r8ST3cFIaa	Well I hate to break it to you but most teenagers drink. If she's drinking she's most likely smoking stuff too. But she probably get's it from older friends. Yes she's very young and I would be worried too. You should talk to her. =\|`|wdntZl92aa	You should talk to her personally and tell her how you feel.  Once she knows you are worried maybe she'll stop.|`|k6CSa9caaa	yep, friends or fake id|`|ae282ad4a748f8c85406e4649235ff16aa	Kids who drink alcohol usually do it because their friends are doing it. It is rarely done in isolation. It is not so much how does she buy the stiff but how can she afford it? How much money does she have at her disposal in any one week? Where is she consuming alcohol and what is the level of personal risk, as well as the damage to her young liver? Any 13 year old female consuming alcohol has to have a reason to want to 'lose control' of herself. you ned to look at your and her lifestyle and the family choices that are being made. This is a big picture, a big problem and it will need a creative solution. How's school? Is she being bullied by staff or peers? Where is she going when she is out on leisure time? Who is going to her room? Is she taking birth control? You need professional help to deal with this. Bernardo's run programmes for parents with 'problem' teenagers or 'teenagers with problems' which is more accurate. Check out in your area.

You don't have to have older friends who can get alcohol from you. Could be a friend she already has who has access to alcoholic beverages in their home. Or, she may have older friends you don't know about. Could be older friends she's met online that she is secretly hanging out with, without your knowing about it. <br>  <br>  I recommend just confronting her about it. Remember you're the parent, not her. You have the right to enforce things. At the same time however, don't attack her and assume. Ask about it, tell her the consequences of drinking alcohol. It's important for her to know these things, she's only 13.|`|kV0f4IiNaa	Wow yeah thats a problem. Well, I would confront her about it, but dont be too harsh on her, it will only make her trust you about things like that less. And then tell her how you feel about her doing it - CALMLY. Otherwise shell freak! That is really young to be drinking, but you dont even know the whole story about how they got there in the first place. So just sit her down, and take it easy. Goodluck! :)|`|AA10475412	Have a good talk with her,  have her explain why she has alcoholic beveregas in her room, and try to explain to her that she is underage, and also explain to her the dangers of drinking alcohol at a very young age.|`|K4J6f1e0aa	When she gets home, she should find you sitting at the kitchen table with the bottle and you should say, "What is this? I found THIS in your room!"<br>  But give her a chance to explain. Maybe it's not hers, you never know|`|eR7BjZvIaa	talk to her about the consequences of alcohol|`|3GwAQynXaa	I doubt you know ALL her friends... Seriously though, that's a bit extreme for 13. Punish her appropriately.|`|jsgKGtdBaa	wow. <br>  you write like a 13 year old.|`|qwhI0AZXaa	friends parents, or friends she's not telling you about|`|DfKdzD46aa	teenagers will get ahold of alcohol, it is just something that happens. It is pretty hard to stop the best you can do is confront her about it and talk about how drinking is bad and hurts your body when you are so young...but you should also be careful with this because you have invaded her privacy by going through her room<br>  <br>  and then because you know she has been drinking perhaps its time to keep more tabs on where she is. call her friends parents when she says she is sleeping over to make sure thats really where she is going|`|nqK90MGcaa	Although underage drinking is pretty much inevitable, I think 13 is way too young to start drinking. I started when I was 17. My sister started younger, around 16. I would suggest you tell her you found them but don't approach her in an angry way. Tell her you're concerned. Also, this could point to a problem because most kids drink with their friends, but it seems your daugther is drinking alone in her room?<br>  <br>  The main issue here is not how she got the alcohol but why she is drinking it. Trust me, don't get mad, that's the worst thing you can do. Just talk calmly about it to her and really try to get her to open up to you.|`|1VtHuwPWaa	PLEASE READ THIS<br>  <br>  You can tell here that you found here bottles and dont like it. But dont get super mad and take away the bottles with anger because then she is gonna get mad and buy more alchohol and get very drunk just to piss you off. <br>  Talk to her about alcohol and tell her its dangerous to drink at a early age (especially if she is 13). Then tell her she and her friends can enjoy alcohol but in a small amount. Then she will be happy and thinks you are really cool. If you put stupid rules about drinking to her she is gonna get mad and probably drink even more.|`|SYaSbJb5aa	Friends with older siblings, fake IDs.<br>  <br>  I didn't start drinking until I was 15, but I realize kids are starting younger with everything these days.<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, don't freak out on her.  Have a calm conversation with her about it, and just be supportive.  If she feels safe to talk about it with you, she won't have to sneak around and end up in even more trouble.  Make sure she is drinking in moderation (make her drinks for her, before she goes to parties), and that she always has a safe way home. <br>  <br>  If you absolutely do not want her drinking,  you're going to have some problems, because let's face it...kids do what they wanna do.  Just tread lightly.|`|K5F9T4vNaa	wow, well i do drink and im 18, but when i was 13 i had no idea what drinking even was.   I really dont know how she could of possibly gotten the alcohol.  All i can think of is maybe a friend with older siblings, taking from someones parents. or maybe there are some older friends your not aware about.  I would adress this, thats way young for anything of that matter.|`|EQKaMfPAaa	it's pretty easy, one of her friends could have an older friend or relative that buys it for them.  Or they could be steeling it from the parents or another relative of one of her friends.  when I was younger there was an older guy on the street that we were not friends with but he would still buy alcohol for us if we asked and paid him a little extra.|`|FnEqPhfYaa	what better time to drink than when 13 - she won't load up and drink drive <br>  she's not gonna get wasted and forget about the baby <br>  she'll not get the sack for turning up drunk <br>  wots the worse she can do - get a hang over and flunk an exam<br>   yeah and so what<br>   she's 13 she can sober up and re sit<br>  your teenage years are the best time to f-up on booze cos nothing serious will happen just be glad she's not in a gang or doing drugs<br>  if the worse ya kid is doing is drinking i say you could be doing worse|`|wFTJaB3Maa	either shes stealing it from someone or someone is buying it from her.<br>  <br>  if your 13 year old knows she shouldn't be drinking but shes does it anyway she clearly has no regard for your authority so my suggestion beat her *** until she does. no 13 year old should be drinking and if my child was i would beat the **** out of her.|`|Q6uA8t9baa	What ever you do, every teenager is going to try a drink at one point or other in there life. In my opinion, be glad that she was drinking in house house and not in the street or out somewhere. She would have probobly got the drink from friends houses there must have been plenty of drinks left after christmas.|`|scX6smKVaa	her firends may be getting the drink for her or perhaps she is doing what all the teens do around my local shop.... asking strangers to go in there and but ut for them<br>  <br>  Sometimes as well there are those self serve machines in supermarkets which do not require ID.......<br>  <br>  it is a phase she is going through but 13 is so young!! I could understand 16 onwards but 13 is bad!!!|`|AA10609634	How she gets it is not the issue.  The fact that she wants it, and is hiding it, is the issue. <br>  <br>  Take her to an Ala-Teen meeting.  If she has a real problem, then it will help her.  If she doesn't, it should scare her enough to stop experimenting.|`|7NtMbVCJaa	if her friends hav any older brothers or sisters they could be getting it for her.

And if you give a child alcohol in some states, you can be arrested for it, and others it is perfectly legal.<br>  <br>  If that was my daughter, I would explain to her that if she is going to drink at home, she should start with wine (I'm Sicilian) if she is going to be responsible. Otherwise, she should wait until she is in high school. <br>  <br>  I was in high school once, and all my friends were drinking at 15, those watery beers. ick!<br>  <br>  A mother knows best! Don't make it a complex situation, and then drinking may not seem like such a fascinating trend then.<br>  <br>  Cheers!|`|mkA615Ataa	unfortunately if a teenager is determined you may not be able to stop her, all I can suggest is to try and find something for her to do that she is interested in so she's not bored and continue to bring her up to not care what others say so she doesn't feel pressured by her peers. If she's already hooked seek help from the professionals, your doctor will be able to advise you who you can speak to for help for free.|`|l5IjG90oaa	13 is too young.. i'm 16 and i only started drinking monthly just before my 16th birthday. you could argue that i'm too young but i love having fun :D she is at risk of having unprotected sex and doing regretable things.. that's the most worrying thing imo. tell her that you will give her alcohol (get her some WKD) if she invites her mates round.. thats what my mum tells me :P i know alot of 13 yr olds that drink, it isn't uncommon but it isn't a good thing.|`|ou3wQcuYaa	She's probably getting it from one of her friends.  They could have an older friend getting it for them.  She is probably drinking because she is insecure.  I would tell her how you feel about drinking but I would not be super strict because she will find a way to rebel against you.|`|sooNO69Naa	is her boyfirend  bad influence it usually stems from dating other guys.....or maybe a party she went to she expiriemtned with alcholhol .....teaching her about what happens when ppl abuse aclhohol now is a good idea....why dont you just ask her where she got it...|`|rxfKjMTnaa	Its not necessary one of her friends thats getting it, but prehaps her friend knows someone who is 18, which is probally the case.|`|fuQH62V1aa	maybe she has more friends that you dont know about?

If it's a larger, soup spoon just fill the spoon, don't over fill it.  I generally use a smaller spoon and over fill it just a tad.|`|EVSqPbT5aa	I always use one tablespoon of coffee grounds per 2 cups of coffee.  this works for small amounts too.  i'm sure if you just want to make 1 cup, one tablespoon will work just fine, i don't think enough water would percolate to hit all the coffee in there, but you would not be too watered down.|`|1ydQOcLZaa	Normally for a regular to strong coffee its 1 tablespoon to 8 oz of water.<br>  <br>  For you making two 6 oz cups it would work down to about 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons of coffee. <br>  <br>  Always use cold water for brewing coffee.

I put whipped cream stars from a spray can on top of a cool whipped frosted cake.  Stored it in the fridge covered.

gaXUIduMaa	Most have trace amounts, not enough to get high on.  I did not know Sparks had that much and, if it did, minors could not buy it.  Most drinks that have any sugar in it will have trace amounts of alcohol in it, including coke.  The drug that is most prevalent is caffeine.  Although caffeine is in many drinks, large amounts can be dangerous for you so at least be careful on how much you take.  Many of them also have taurine (sp) and / or guranna (sp) which there has not been much study about that can be a problem as well.|`|awskuSGBaa	Sparks has alcohol.|`|74f8e743f8a3465fff1898d42967fe25aa	Technically caffeine is a drug, but I don't really count that (I know people that do, though).

ZNe6B9TQaa	It's a pretty low quality wine maker.  fyi.  Doesn't mean it can't be enjoyed, and it should drink as smooth as water but probably won't have any vibrant flavors.<br>  <br>  A rose should always be served chilled.  As should all whites. <br>  <br>  A screw top used to be viewed negatively, but now the way they are made makes them much more effective and intelligent than corking wine (corks often have holes and cracks that can leave wine "corked" if not just sub par in general); many of the best wine makers have switched over.|`|hLohtlPEaa	I can't believe there are so many wine snobs out there. A lot of extremely fine Australian wines have screw tops or artificial corks. I have opened a lot of French reds that were ruined because the corks did not seal properly. My experience is 21 years of bar tending in a fine dining establishment.|`|FxAD44Moaa	screw caps!   omg,  why not spoil the wine while you're at it. you realize what happens to metals when it's exposed to acids like wine?<br>  <br>  <br>  corks seal better,   they are longer lasting and keep the vacuum intact.<br>  <br>  as a wine maker,  i frown heavily on screw caps.. if they can't keep water and soda's fresh and void of exposure.. how do you think it'll keep most alcohol from this  problem?<br>  <br>  screw caps...   INDEED!<br>  <br>  you can have the screw capped wines.. i'll stick with what lasts and won't taste like aluminum foil with mold in it!|`|9epL6qjBaa	I have only seen the Menage a Trois Red and White blends.  To me, it looks like there is another Rose variety.  The other two are great, so if you like Rose or White Zinfandel, this should be good as well.<br>  <br>  Yes, you chill it, the same that you'd chill a white.<br>  <br>  As for screwtops, there is a great shortage of cork and it's also cheaper to package liquid in bottles with caps rather than cork.  Materials are cheaper and the process of packaging is cheaper as well.  I sold Packaging Machinery to wineries, breweries and soda/water/juice factories for ten years, so I have experience.<br>  <br>  Edit - screwtop is a misnomer.  There is a "perception" that it's cheap wine, but I had a 98 rated Pinot Noir about a week ago that cost me about $60 for the bottle and guess what?  It had a screw top.  Screwtops are a packging decision, not a "quality of the wine" decision.  Sorry to burst anyone's bubble on that.|`|AA10528854	Rose can be sweet or dry; either way it should be slightly chilled. <br>  <br>  Corks were used to prevent oxygen from getting into the wine and destroying it. Screw caps are just as effective and actually have a better chance at keeping the wine fresh then corks do. Of course, both screw caps and corks can be defective but the rates of corks being defective are much higher then screw caps. Honestly, the best preservation method is a BIB (Bag in box) wine; it'll keep fresh for a month or more.|`|72hMibsVaa	screw top says I am cheap.  <br>  <br>  cork tops say I am expensive.<br>  <br>  A rose wine is a sweet wine.  <br>  <br>  Maybe you should consider a trip to Epcot's food and wine festival in the fall and take the wine course they offer.  i think it is like 250$.|`|D3xEuLqxaa	could not tell you what types of wines these are but i think i can answer your other questions.<br>  <br>  when it comes to wine you do want to chill all wine.  one thing most people get wrong is that you should serve wine at room temp.  how ever room temp in not 72 degrees or what your room is currently at now.  room temp is the temp which you should store your wine in.  for me i store my reds in about 62 degrees and my whites in about 50 degrees.  if you don't have the proper storage for this i recommend throwing your red wine in the frig about 15 min before you drink it.  white should be thrown in well before that.  <br>  <br>  As for corks a lot of places now are starting to move to the screw tops because with these you will be able to store wine standing up and you also eliminate the chance of the cork ruining the wine.  The reason I think not everyone has gone to this is because of the history of it.  Wine has almost always been topped with cork and people assume that the best wine is corked and cheap wine has screwed on tops.  Once people realize that a screwed on top are the same a cored wine you will start seeing more of them.<br>  <br>  hope this helps a little|`|DjjUe4MBaa	I have never seen anyone else on here even mention the wine brand Menage a Trois, it is one of the best ones out there! I personally like their red wine the best, but the rose is also in my top five favorites (and I've tried a lot of wines)! <br>  <br>  Rose wines are meant to be chilled anyway so go ahead and put it in an ice bucket or in the fridge. If you need to get it cold faster, it's fine to just put it in the freezer as long as you keep an eye on it. <br>  <br>  As far as the corks go, they were simply a way to seal wines before the invention of the screw cap.

AA11142539	Obviously you know your family situation better than anyone on this board, but don't you think that's a bit... extreme?  I know of very few people that actually didn't drink until they turned 21.  By surreptitiously tampering with his drinks, you are 1) shielding him from the full effects of alcohol, which could have unfortunate consequences if he gets the idea that he has some ridiculously high tolerance for alcohol, and 2) deliberately deceiving him could harm your relationship with him if he ever found out.<br>  <br>  You said he's experimenting.  I'd say, let him experiment.  As a caring sibling, I think I'd only try to interfere if it becomes dangerous, like drinking and driving, or consistently drinking to excess, or if he becomes a violent drunk.  The only way he'll learn his limits is by pushing at them a little.<br>  <br>  That being said, make sure that you are not LEGALLY required to step in, like if you have your own apartment and he comes over to drink.  Then you have liability issues that have nothing to do with the morality of the situation.|`|IDBasYahaa	boil it. cook out the alcohol.

A handful of nuts after soya; eggs and grains; you get the idea!|`|2RzEaod9aa	You've been a vegetarian for about 10 years and you're still totally clueless as to how you get your protein? Wow. I'm a vegan and into bodybuilding and I have no trouble...and I can't have the eggs and dairy like you can, and no, I don't pound tofu (I don't do soy in general, actually).<br>  <br>  I eat well-rounded meals consisting of beans, grains, veggies, nuts, and fruits. And tada...I feel great and keep upping the weights. <br>  <br>  <br>  So no, vegetarianism isn't stupid...but becoming a vegetarian while having no understanding of nutrition is. Why do people keep thinking a protein deficiency makes them sick anyway? Why is that the automatic assumption? Why not a sh*tty immune system? Lack of proper hydration? Lack of proper overall nutrition? Why do people always blame protein?|`|suPD7c3gaa	It would have been helpful if you had said what proteins you DO eat.  You also don't say if you are vegan.  So it's possible you may get a lot of well-intended information or suggestions that don't apply or aren't <br>  <br>  Also, it's possible your illnesses have nothing to do with diet, so you mom should be sure you are checked out rather than just assuming it's because you are vegetarian.  I know plenty of vegetarians who are very healthy.<br>  <br>  First, be sure to take daily vitamin supplements.  You could even ask your doctor for recommendations. There are also many types of high-protein snack type bars, so look for those.<br>  <br>  For proteins:  soy products (amounts within reason), milk, cheese & yogurt, all kinds of beans, eggs, nuts, etc.<br>  <br>  Here's a site that could be very informative.

That's dumb.<br>  <br>  You probably go to school and hang around a bunch of other people.  Usually people that eat lots of junk food and crap like that.  They make themselves sick.  You get sick.  Schools are breeding grounds for sicknesses.  Ask any parent.  My kids very rarely got sick -- maybe twice a year at the most.  Put them in daycare, they get sick now every few weeks.  I ask other parents and they say, "Just wait until they start school, they will get sick even more often."<br>  <br>  So, what to do?  Get lots of rest.  Go lots of exercise.  Eat lots of quality fresh organic foods.  And then try to keep your distance from your drooling hacking coughing classmates and friends.|`|pWLbxW7Maa	Protein powder- it comes in dessert flavors and blends well with milk, or I guess in your case soy milk.

hKlsJgVSaa	I am not a fan of spice. I am for anything not hot. B-b-q, sea salt and vinegar sounds good though too. I haven;t had that one yet.    Here is my favorite sauce, followed by a close second.    Honey Soy Sauce:    1/2 cup butter  1 cup honey  1 cup soy sauce  1 cup terriyaki sauce  1 tbsp seseme oil  1 tsp fresh grated ginger    Heat in a sauce pan until melted and combined. Keep unused portion in the fridge in an airtight container. Heat a little for each use.    ---------------  Rhubarb B-B-Q---I understand not everyone has rhubarb on hand but this is good for future wings or what ever.    Ingredients:   1 heaping cup chopped fresh or frozen rhubarb  2/3 cup water  1 medium onion, finely chopped  1 teaspoon canola oil  1 garlic clove, minced  3/4 cup ketchup  1/2 cup packed brown sugar  1/2 cup dark corn syrup  2 tablespoons cider vinegar  2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce  1 tablespoon Dijon mustard  1 1/2 teaspoons hot pepper sauce  1/4 teaspoon salt         In a small saucepan, bring rhubarb and water to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 5-6 minutes or until tender. Remove from the heat; cool slightly.     Place rhubarb in a blender or food processor; cover and process until smooth. Set aside.     In the same saucepan, saute onion in oil until tender. Add garlic; saute 1 minute longer. Add the remaining ingredients.     Whisk in rhubarb puree until blended. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes. Use as a basting sauce for grilled meats. Store in the refrigerator. Yield: 2-1/3 cups.|`|YYAu9lFDaa	mmmmmm hot, bleu cheese, butter & garlic, bbq    i'm hungry!|`|97998ea5cfab786153b0361648864558aa	The ones in KFC =]]|`|008512e32e60fcef19c7029ae0dc4d45aa	i like boneless buffalo style or boneless garlic parm|`|JoAfcy4Caa	mine is butter and garlic|`|hT7BhNamaa	Tripping On, basically, I like to be able taste the base ingredient, without having food pasted with all that sugar.

But my number one snack would probably be smoothies I buy bags of frozen strawberries and I use 1 cup strawberries 1/2cup soy milk 1/2 juice (but don't use orange juice it over powers the taste of the strawberries) 1/4 tea spoon of vanillia and a banana now and then. You can also make it like sorbet (however it's spelt) by lessening the liquids or adding more strawberries.     below are some websites with recipes if you're interested|`|m3rt9x8Caa	everything apart from meat, dairy and eggs (basically anything to do with animals)|`|AA12334360	Here are some examples from my favourite veggie/vegan resturant:    Appetisers    Tamari doused pumpkin, sunflower & sesame seeds   Spiced roast nuts     Bowl of marinated olives with a selection of breads    Starters    Grilled polenta, feta and warm Mediterranean vegetable medley with a sun dried tomato pesto dressing    Toasted walnut, blue cheese & pear salad with a balsamic & walnut oil dressing     Garlic balsamic button mushrooms on wholewheat bruschetta served with a salad garnish    Sushi plate - carrot & roasted pepper sushi nori served with a tamari dipping sauce, avocado tempura & a cucumber, hijiki & ginger salad    Chestnut, leek & pumpkin seed croustade topped with roasted butternut squash served with a fresh tomato relish    Main Course    Creamy root vegetable & cheddar encroute served with rosemary roast potatoes, steamed seasonal vegetables & a brown lentil & cider sauce    Vegetarian Fish & Chips ~ the wholesome alternative    Quinoa crumbed tofu nori with tatare sauce, served with sweet potato wedges, homemade ketchup, minted peas & a salad garnish    Walnut, rosemary & pumpkin croquettes on saut potatoes with a rich tomato sauce & steamed seasonal vegetables    Ramiro pepper & courgette kofta with a cumin & coriander scented dahl served with spicy spinach & coconut fritters, basmati rice & a beetroot raita|`|gUscgmroaa	fried tofu, boiled tofu and yes youve guessed it baked tofu|`|NNiN0tK0aa	They eat everything meat eaters do except meat, dairy and eggs.  Meat and dairy can be replaced with fake meats or soya meat, dairy can be replaced with soya/nut/seed products.  The only things we can't buy substitutes for are eggs and seafood.  (You can buy fish cakes/fingers but not crab/mussels/mackerel etc).    Other foods are lentils, beans, chickpeas, grains, nuts, seeds and coconut and tofu.  (made from soya beans).    It's a myth that vegans replace meat with fruit and veg.  They replace it with grains+pulses (lentils/beans/chickpeas) which together make a complete protein or with soya which is complete all by itself.|`|e598a4a2cc577e31e93cb794b800a568aa	don't forget seaweed!
FlsrXuJOaa	I'm not sure why you have found meat replacements so expensive. At least where I live, I can get four fake chicken patties or veggie burgers for like 3 dollars. the same with the soy crumbles (which i use in sooo many things). Also, tofu is pretty cheap and can be very tasty if you marinate it overnight before cooking.     Instead of meat in your lasagna, try adding eggplant or mushrooms that have a lot of meat-like texture.  sauteed portabello mushrooms with cheese on toast makes a GREAT burger-like sandwich. be experimental. Before you go completely vegetarian, try just slowly cutting meat out of your diet. try eating it for just one meal a day, and then only a couple of times a week. All the while, experiment with recipes you find online and see what you like. I think you'll see that going vegetarian is a LOT easier than you expected.|`|c67a2f77ab7471bed4b2f279ff05e2e1aa	Don't.  Hypospadias is a horrible deformity of new-born baby boys and it is ten times as common when the mother is a vegetarian.   That proves that the bodies of human beings need animal protein, and there are vital substances in meat and fish which we cannot do without.

Or with one so deformed, twisted and small  that he can't wee properly and can't ever have sex ?|`|o1KWtGzLaa	I've been one for almost 8 years so listen up.     Buy 'Quorn' it taste exactly like meat and as I find, cost a little less if not exactly the same most the time. Quorn 'Southern style chicken burgers' are the best, they taste right the beef burger sub great but doesn't taste of cow, the bacon,, better than the real thing. I could go on. You can buy a pack of 8 southern style burgers for 4 max. It's not a lot.    But hear this now, if you won't accept a substitute, don't go vege. That's how I went for years before quorn came and I only stayed off it not for adapting to the food but remembering how I learnt about slaughtering livestock as a child. It was horrific. But really, a life on baked potato, vege salads, jam and cheese sandwiches etc, isn't wonderful for long. Just buy the subs, if not I can sense you won't last long as you lack the dedication.|`|PpQ9v6F0aa	i am still in the process of going vegetarian. i just take meat out of my diet. at lunch if i grab a sandwich i just take the ham or turkey out of it.  start by eating peanuts and beans as a sorce of protein. there are some cheaper vegetarian foods u just gotta look for 'em.    (: hope i helped a bit.|`|NNiN0tK0aa	I'm surprised you find fake meats more expensive, I found them cheaper than real meat.  Where do you live?  Try looking in health shops for cheap packeted soya mince/meat rather than frozen, the kind where you open a sachet of powder and you add hot water.  They're not as realistic but they're usually cheaper.  For spag bol and lasagna you can use lentils instead of mince, for chillie you can use beans....for chicken pieces you could cut portabella mushrooms into big squares, but it wouldn't taste the same, or you could use tofu.  Or just make bean casseroles instead.  I'm raw vegan and make sweet and sour vegetables....obviously not the same but give you the sauce flavour.  You could buy some fake meats even if you don't replace all your meats with fake meats.  When you're desparate for a ham sandwich buy fake ham slices...even my dogs eat them and steal them!!  They're not easily tricked by most fake meats.  I guess they smell different even if they taste the same.  But fake deli slices fool my dogs.    Non fake meat sandwiches = hoummus, falafel (or both together), peanut butter, other nut butters, vegan pates, egg & mayo, burgers - make your own out of beans or lentils or nuts, nut cutlets mmm, home made sausages, vegetable grills (sort of make a grill shape out of vegetables and flavourings)  marinated mushrooms (marinate in a mix of soya sauce and olive oil) with avocado, scallions, cherry tomato, avocado and lettuce - mmm!|`|2zHq2XIMaa	TVP - textured vegetable protein, is inexpensive, simple to use, versatile and can be seasoned to taste like a number of different "meats".     you buy it dry packaged in any good health food store.

You can find recipes for seitan on veggie sites. I will give you a few links. Gong vegetarian is relatively easier than most think. You can get plenty of flavor from garlic (I find that makes a good replacement flavor for chicken broth) You can make spinach lasagna, I still eat plenty of Asian food that has an abundance of flavor with stir-frys and such and Mexican foods. Just because you go veggie, doesn't mean that you have to give up bold flavors. Most of the time when I go out people don't even know that I am a vegetarian because my meals look normal. When I go to family gatherings, I'll bring dishes and they all go for them because they are flavorful and yummy, not even realizing that they are eating vegetarian foods. As far as ham samdwiches, there is meat replacors that you could get, but it won't taste like what you are use to so you might be dissapointed. Try making it your sadwich exactly the same just with out the meat and replace it with spicier chese such as Pepper Jack or add bananna peppers to it. It just takes a little expirimenting. After a while you'll get the hang of it. I'm also going to give you a link to a website that will give you more advice on how to transition into the vegetarian life. Remember to look at labels, because there are many hidden meat products in foods you wouldn't suspect such as beef flavoring, chicken stock, gelatin, and lard. Good Luck on your new adventure!
ELIKp5tDaa	well, im not against vegan or vegetarian-ism... but if youre that active and probably pretty healthy why not just eat less red meat and use chicken or fish as a protien source<br>  vegan food is a P.I.T.A to find and tends to cost a bit more than non vegan food. also if youre looking to eat healthy you could always just buy organic raised foods..|`|e5VUwaRsaa	Eat lots of nuts!

Check out www.veganbodybuilding.com to get some inspiration. They have a free forum, too.|`|f0ad6531ce43c9c2d656b52953c68bd7aa	Well, become vegetarian first.  Then after a few weeks, get rid of dairy.  Then after another few weeks, get rid of eggs.  Then, after that, get rid of every other animal product.<br>  That's just a suggestion though to get used to what foods you can and cannot eat.  So, if you like, become vegan tomorrow.  I'm not lying when I say it's a bit overwhelming to do it all at once.  It takes time to perfect the vegan.<br>  Also, a bit of advice.  Once you become vegan, do not freak out if you accidentally eat something with animal products.  When I first became vegan, I ate Jell-o, but I didn't know at the time that gelatin is an animal product.  So if you eat something un-vegan, don't break down and cry.  It's just another lesson you learn from a mistake ;-)|`|TDKwUpisaa	Yes you should! I went vegan after 1 year of being a vegetarian first.

There are vitamins and minerals that you will have to supplement because you eat absolutely no animal product. This means you have to be extra careful when you are planning your diet. Nutritional concerns for a vegan are inadequate amounts of riboflavin, vitamins D and B-12, iron, zinc, iodide, and calcium. Vitamin B-12 comes from animal sources (B-12 deficiency includes anemia, nerve damage, and mental dysfunction) But you can find B-12 in fortified soybean milk. Special diet planning is required for a vegan lifestyle. I am not against this lifestyle, I actually believe the people who are able to do this lifestyle properly are some of the healthiest people out there. There are other alternatives to a vegan diet. There are lactovegetarian (person who eats plant and dairy products), lactoovovegetarian (plant products, dairy, and eggs), and many others. I suggest doing a lot of research on this before you make your final decision. It would also be wise to go see a nutritionist to make sure that you are off to a healthy start. Because you are so active they might suggest supplements but those are never safe to self diagnose yourself with. Good luck =)|`|YiFJkgbRaa	(This is a secret, shhh.  A whisper.  That's why it's in parenthesis.<br>  Most people who will tell you not to go vegan have done 1/30th of the reading that people who are vegan have done.<br>  I 'whispered' it so people wouldn't get mad at me.)<br>  <br>  When you become vegan, you love food more than you ever did before.  Vegans I know compulsively look up new and interesting ways to get all their vitamins and minerals on the internet.<br>  Buy nutritional yeast to get your B-12.  It tastes like nutty Parmesan cheese and it has tons of B-12, the deficiency of which a previous commenter made look soooooo scary.<br>  <br>  If you're not an idiot, you'll be fine; that's basically what it comes down with veganism.  You'll figure out what foods to eat so your body gets what it needs.  Soy milk is way yummier in coffee than cow's milk and sugar.  Soak some tofu in a marinade overnight, put it on skewers and let it broil.  Puree applesauce and flaxseeds into a muffin batter.<br>  I do tons of exercise vegan.  I eat tons of nuts, beans, rice, bread, etc.  You'll figure it out.<br>  You'll be fine.<br>  <br>  Go to www.theppk.com.  Explore the forums, introduce yourself.  Read the recipes.  Big, hearty meals.  Ask people questions.<br>  <br>  A few of the ingredients might seem strange, but once you start buying soy milk instead of regular, and nutritional yeast, and miso, it will all fall together.  A few really expensive shopping trips in, and then you'll be stocked with enough stuff to make yummy meals all the time.<br>  <br>  I live vegan on about fifteen dollars a week for groceries.  I buy dry nuts, dry rice, oranges, spinach, peanut butter, whole wheat bread, soy milk and sometimes tofu.  Sweet potatoes rock my world.  It's not as expensive as people make you think - the only stuff that's super expensive is fake meat and fake ice cream.  Even then, a pint of vegan ice cream is the same as a pint of Ben and Jerry's.<br>  <br>  Honestly, I feel great ALL the time.  For whatever reason, there is this crazy antagonism towards veganism - people are bitter and mock, viciously attack vegans all the time.  It's totally lame that you can attack someone for an ethical or health choice; it almost feels like discrimination.  I have no idea why it happens - probably because it's different.  <br>  <br>  Anyway, fat free vegan is a good source too.  Google it, but go to her blog page.<br>  Buy cookbooks.<br>  Eat A LOT of cheap, yummy food.<br>  Please go for it - I promise you won't regret it, as long as you're smart and have fun with it.<br>  You'll love food more - wait until you discover tempeh.
cu8fUJbMaa	When my kids were small they loved Ramen noodles!  I kept a zip-lock freezer bag in the freezer and when we had a spoonful of left over veggies from dinner I would just put them in the freezer bag and stick it back in the freezer. When we made Ramen (or any other soup, really!) I would pull the bag out and add some of the veggies to the soup. It's a good way to save the little amounts of veggies that would normally go to waste and put them to use!|`|pYtnOnbDaa	here are at LEAST 24<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.budget101.com/ramen_noodle_recipes.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.budget101.com/ramen_noodle_re...</a><br>  <br>  they sound good and affordable....<br>  <br>  HERE IS MY PERSONAL family fav.<br>  <br>  1 package ramen noodles UNCOOKED<br>  1 8 oz. package coleslaw mix<br>  2 green onions-chopped<br>  1 celery stick-sliced<br>  1/2 cup almonds-slivered- toast them so good- on cookie sheet, 300 for 5 mins. each side<br>  1/2 cup sunflower seeds(shelled)<br>  1/2 bell pepper-chopped<br>  1 carrot-grated<br>  <br>  <br>  Dressing:<br>  <br>  1/2 cup salad oil<br>  1/4 cup vinegar<br>  1/2 tsp. salt<br>  1/2 tsp. pepper<br>  1 tsp. sugar<br>  1-2 pinches ramen noodle flavouring from package(optional)<br>  <br>  Directions:<br>  <br>  * In a large bowl mix together all vegetables, sunflower seeds and almonds. <br>  <br>  * Mix dressing ingredients into in a small bowl and whisk until blended.<br>  <br>  * Add dressing to salad and mix well.<br>  <br>  * Crumble dry noodles  DO NOT COOK<br>  <br>  * Mix noodles into salad, cover and refrigerate until ready to eat.<br>  <br>  Noodles soften when mixed with slaw & dressing after a couple hours... yummy.|`|nhaH0nJLaa	yes - there's plenty!

0maJCeLCaa	I was a vegetarian for 5 years - and it started as a fad.  A friend of my mums used to be a vegetarian, and she claimed that I could never live as one.     So I did to prove a point. But it brought out a latent metabolism disorder, and I gained over 40 pounds in the 5 years. Once detected, I had to go back to eating meat, and I am on medication for life, so the pounds are slowly coming off - about 10 to go to my pre-veg weight. My health will never be the same, tho ...    I am not religious at all, by the way ...
d0d7b35a707f98e4d94fb32cc3b60b5baa	Just wash them in hot water and mild dish detergent like Dawn. Don't scour them or else you will remove the "seasoning " . If food is sticking, try rubbing them with olive oil before you begin cooking, and don't use a high flame since this causes food to stick.|`|vs5rK3iRaa	I use cast iron cookware almost exclusively, some of it passed down from my mother.

I have 5 different kind I actually cook in all the time! Scrub it with like a brillo pad. Make sure it has no "PITS"(bumps). Scrub till it is totally smooth. Inside is WAY more important than the out, but clean the outside as good as you can. Rinse it....put it in your oven on 350 for @ 30 min. Take it out let it cool. rub it with oil on the inside. I hang mine. Something passed down. These are so great to cook in. I make cornbread,biscuits, fry,I have a flat one for pancakes. You dont have to wash them every time after you use them. If possible...just wipe it clean with a paper towel.|`|APNB4OfIaa	If they are extremely dirty, use a wire brush to clean them up.  After they are clean, put a high temp oil in them & get them hot.  Dump the oil & put them back in the oven on a medium temp for a couple of hours.  Wipe out the excess oil & cook as usual.  The actual "seasoning" occurs as you cook.  You should always use a little oil when you cook for several cycles.  Never use soap to clean them or you'll wind up doing the process all over again.|`|HHDq9ajTaa	I buy cast iron pans like that too. Some have really been crudy. I do soak them in dish soap and I do scrub them very well until clean of crud, rinse and place on the burner and heat to dry it completely. Let cool. Then I pour a coating of oil, sometimes Crisco in the pan and rub all over the pan including the bottom and the handle. Place it on a baking sheet and bake at 350 degrees for an hour. Then I check the pan for high and low spots and add oil to those spots and repeat for about 30 minutes. And the kitchen will stink while you are doing this. Once the major seasoning is done you only have to season it again maybe once in a couple years. But taking care of it after using it each time has to be done. I use my cast iron for many different cooking ventures. Gravy is a bit messy, so I soak the pan in hot water and soap....yes soap....I use the scrubbie part of the sponge to clean my cast iron pans too....never hurts the original seasoning.  After washing place on the burner with the flame on and heat to dry it. Then with paper towel and oil rub it to re oil the pan and put it away. NOW here is the trick...when ever you use the cast iron pan to cook in....you must HEAT to HOT then add the bit of OIL about enough to lightly cover the bottom of the pan and heat that oil for 10-15 seconds then carefully CAREFULLY add your meats and let them brown first before you attempt to move the meat. Once the meat is browned it seems to be much easier to slide around or turn. The browned bits on the bottom of the pan is for the gravy. Add 1 cup or so of water and let that boil up scraping the brown bits as the water heats. Add your flour water mixture and stir as you drizzle in the mixture to make the gravy.  There you go......Now everyone has different ideas, some work and some don't. This works very well for me.

So my answer would have to be yes.<br>  <br>  I eat as many veggies and fruits as I like, anything that is in season at the local farmer's market. Organic and fresh is best. The more raw foods you eat the better. I am trying to transition to a complete raw vegan diet myself. I have to say, I have never felt better in my life.

It has nothing to do with an animal product because Kosher foods can't mix meat and dairy.  So ignore that yogurt claim and enjoy!    Here's another ingredient to look out for: Rennet.  Rennet is the stomach lining of a cow and is found in most hard cheeses (parmesan, regianno, gruyerre...I know none of those are spelled right, sorry!)|`|m1cEbzBcaa	many jellies (as in fruit spreads) don't contain gelatin, its Jello that you can't eat.

As for cheesecakes, go for baked cheesecakes, not only do they taste better in my opinion, they have no gelatine.  No icing doesn't have gelatine  Cream has trace ammounts of gelatine    I should re-phrase the abouve about cream. Not all brands of cream has gelatine, if you buy organic cream, it's gelatine free.

You could almost fins it everywhere and anywhere, from super marts to baking shops.    Just try to go back to the place where you bought your other baking needs and ask the attendant if they have any caster sugar.    I can almost guarantee you that you would be able to start baking on that day.|`|707gOCvbaa	Refined caster sugar is made with sugar cane or beets which have been treated to remove the molasses. The refined form of this sugar is white, sweet, and does not usually discolor with baking, unless it becomes caramelized. Unrefined or golden caster sugar, on the other hand, is made with the molasses left in. As a result, it has a faint creamy to golden color, and it will darken with baking. The unrefined sugar cane also makes this type of caster sugar more complex, flavorwise. Most recipes specify which type should be used

They include a number of attractive wildflower species with showy flowers found growing singularly or in large groups; many species are also grown in gardens. Those that are grown in gardens include large plants used in a mixed herbaceous border and small plants that are grown in rock or alpine gardens.  The seeds of the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) are widely consumed in many parts of Central and Eastern Europe. The sugared, milled mature seeds are eaten with pasta, or they are boiled with milk and used as filling or topping on various kinds of sweet pastry. Milling of mature seeds is carried out either industrially or at home, where it is generally done with a manual poppy seed mill.    Hope this helps!
hKlsJgVSaa	What are you buying that is worth 150 a week for 2 people!!!    While you shouldn't just cut a bunch of calories you can still diet for your daughter by cutting out all the garbage. She doesn't need extra stuff with your breast milk as the source for all the "extras".    These first 2 recipes  can make great left overs as well, but the left overs are entirly different meals.    Here is what I would use left over from both of these recipes for....    Quesdailla's  Soup  Sandwich (sliced or for the chicken-chicken salad)  Mexcan-like burritos, tacos, etc.. simer with some green chili peppers, cumin and onion.  Shredded b-b-q    Crock Pot Chicken Salsa Curry    10 chicken thighs-bone in  1 jar of your fav salsa  1/2 onion chopped  1 tablespoon curry (or about 1/2 if you don't like a strong curry taste)  1/2 cup sour cream    Place the chicken in the crock pot. Mix the onion, curry and salsa. Pour over the chicken and cook on low for about 6-8 hours.    When the chicken is done take it out of the crock pot and put on a serving plate. Add the sour cream and mix well. Spoon the sauce over the chicken.    This would go well with rice or cous cous.    If you don't have crock pot you could also do this is a roasting pan or a casserole dish with a cover or tin foil(about 200) check it though since it may cook faster. I have only done this once in the ovena dn I think I cooked it for 3-4 hours. This recipe is easy to do smaller portions of as well.  -----------------  Heavenly Harvest Pork Roast:    1/4 cup pomagranite juice  1/4 cup sugar  1 tbsp salt  1 tbsp granulated garlic  1 tbsp steak seasoning  1 tsp black pepper  1 pork roast (4-5) pounds  2 pears, cored peeled and sliced thick  1/2 ornage peel on, sliced thick    Heat the pomagranite juice and sugar until the sugar is dissolved, pour into the bottom of the crock pot.    Mix the salt, granulated garlic, steak seasoning, and pepper. Rub all over pork, then lay the pork on top of the juice in the pan. Turn once so that it is coverd in the juice.    Cover the pork with the pears and oranges. Cover and cook on high for 6-8 hours or until tender. Serve with juice and fruit slices.  -------  And here are some other tasty recipes:    Creamy chicken enchiladas:    1 pound boneless chicken breasts diced  1 8oz package cream cheese cut into cubes  Flour or corn tortillas  1 can diced green chili peppers  ground cumin  1 or 2 can green enchilada sauce  Shredded cheese    Cook the chicken in a skillet and when the chicken is done add the cream cheese, it will melt. As the cream cheese melts add the green chilis, and a couple of good dashes of cumin. Continue to heat on low until the cream cheese has melted.    Fill a tortilla with the chicken mix, roll and place in a baking dish, Continue until the chicken mix is gone. Top with the enchilada sauce and sprinkle with cheese. Bake at 350 for about 10-15 min or until the sauce is nice and hot and the cheese is golden and bubbly.    ****You could also use left overs from the above chicken for this.  ---------  6 pork chops (approx 5oz each)  3 Potatoes  3 Carrots  1 onion  2 Cans cream of mushroom soup  1 1/2 Cans of Milk  3 Tbsp Flour  salt and pepper     Brown the cho|`|hT7BhNamaa	Mommy, are you serious $150.00 a week? Your breast feeding so what? Doesn't mean you can't watch what you eat. Italian's love fish also. We have pasta also, once maybe twice in a week. Our diet is varied. We try and have different meals every night, vegetables are a must, and there is only two of us. The only time we spend $150.00 or a little more, is when our pantry stock is low, I am talking olive oil (Extra Virgin), vegetable oil, vinegar, spices, sugar, salt etc. things like toilet tissue we buy in bulk on special same with paper towels and the likes of that.

Often times you will have at least 2 meals from one casserole.  My favorite site is great and you will find tons of recipes, and healthier choices there.  The ratings are terrific from people that have tried the recipes and done things differently with them to adjust for different reasons...   www.allrecipes.com|`|KUYQ9IMHaa	This is how I stretch my meat dollar, and it's healthier anyway.     Make the meat the lesser part of your meal. For instance, when I make meat sauce, I only use maybe a half lb. of meat and a lot of veggies like mushrooms and zucchini and peppers in the sauce.    When I make meat loaf I make tons of veggies to go with it, and only eat a little of the meat loaf but a lot of veggie sides.    Pasta isn't unhealthy, but it does have a lot of carbs, so try adding a lot of veggies to it, no matter how you're preparing it, so that it's satisfying but not loaded with butter and cheese.     Big salads with the addition of a protein like chicken breasts or sliced steak can be very satisfying and filling. Again, using the meat as the smaller part of the meal. Think jazzed up chef salads. This way you can make one nice steak go a long way. Make a nice salad, top with all kinds of good veggies, the sliced steak, and a good dressing.

Fresh garlic works, as it & onions shouldn't be in a refrigerator.<br>  Kosher salt (never table salt) - use for everything & need it for cooking the pasta.<br>  Sugar, flour, corn flour, baking powder, baking soda.<br>  Peanut butter, honey, maple syrup.<br>  Powdered milk, powdered chocolate (dutched)<br>  <br>  Potatoes. Here's a trick: Keep carrots in a plastic container buried in playground sand (Home Depot $4), it will last weeks without refrigeration.<br>  <br>  Buy this stuff & the only thing you have to do is buy the meats & eggs right before you cook them & buy a stick of butter as needed. Salted butter will hold outside of a fridge for a few days (just keep air tight).|`|ZUepTX57aa	How about pastas and ragu or something like that?

2sqCMMddaa	if there high qulaity s/s pans you cant use pam to cook with, and must use oil to saute with, enough to leave a thin cook on the bottom of the pan|`|hKlsJgVSaa	Make sure to heat them up and don't put food in them cold. If you are cooking something like a steak or meants, those will release on thier own when they are ready, that sort of stuff is pretty fool proof.|`|YYAu9lFDaa	teflon pans!|`|OIRI5Ok7aa	I have that problem, too.  I always use either aluminum pans with some nonstick spray or olive oil (those are the really good ones that chefs actually use--I have a chef friend who gave me some) or nonstick pans.  Some people have a problem with the nonstick pans, but I really think those work best.  I hate the stainless steel pans.|`|hT7BhNamaa	Kitkat, I use the stainless steel pans and I don't have trouble, but there again I deglaze, and I need to go from the hot plate to the oven thus why I use my stainless steel. For everyday I use the Teflon coated as the others are saying.    Chris|`|nOVSf06Raa	if you pay attention all the Chef use these pots and pans you never see them using Teflon ones , the trick is to heat them first add a little oil and put your food in there , if it sticks just soak them afterword in dish soap in the sink ,buy some SOS pads and they will be good as new .|`|dE0vtX2eaa	well. think they call it stainsless steel is because after you cook even if you burn stuff on it, after scrubbing itll be shining. You still have to use oil n lube u dolt :P|`|vcgn6XZgaa	Yes - non stick Tefal pans are the best.|`|ZLWswKHHaa	Haha. I did the same thing a few years back. I found them to be worthless. Nothing kept them from sticking unless you want to deep fry your food. They look pretty though. Use them for foods that won't stick and keep a couple teflon pans for the foods that do is my suggestion.|`|YW74O9aNaa	Yes, food does stick to stainless steel. You have to use non-stick spray or oil and LOTS of it .. still no guarantee that food won't stick. Just buy new non-stick teflon coated ones.|`|HqS6TiiQaa	that sucks, only true non stick is teflon coated pans. Be sure you dont buy cheap teflon coated, it will flake off and is toxic, thus a reason to always use plastic and wood utensils. stainless steel is good for stock pots, but when you want easy to clean pans, always use teflon.|`|fxKhmQNraa	stainless is tricky,but once you get it ,its easy..  the most important thing is to make sure your pan is good and hot before adding any food,add the right amount of oil before your food item and let heat..this should do the trick,you will see a noticable differance.things wont stick..also it take a few uses to work the pan in as well.  later|`|ed5b028cf2a29d0019457073e19036acaa	I started to answer this question a minute ago and somehow lost it.  So here I go again.  I don't recommend a stainless steel frying pan for frying.  It is best to use a black skillet.  If you buy a "black skillet" new and it is nice and shiny, you need to season it well by coating the inside and outside of the skillet and heat it in a very hot oven four to four hundred fifty degrees for about a half an hour. If you want to try your stainless steel pan, you might want to season it well.|`|r8drw5Dcaa	Yeah the surface gets too scratched up and makes everything stick.  I have not found a good solution other than adding a lot of grease or butter so that everything floats in the pan.  I would buy new pans and don't ever use a hard utensil that would scratch the surface and no scrubbies to clean it.  You people using Aluminum pans are poising yourselves slowly.  Most of you will die before the aluminum poising will occur so I wouldn't give it much thought, but some people are sensitive to it.  It makes you feel sick when most days you would not.  And nonstick coating, it does come off, you will be eating it, and we don't really know what it's doing to our bodies, but the chemicals to make it are poisonous.
fxKhmQNraa	this is one i use in my restaurant.  12 sliced white onions,sweat them off,dont brown them.remove and set aside.wipe your pot clean and put back on heat,add i cup of white sugar,and let caramelize,add1.5 cups corn syrup,and 2 cups of red wine,stir to dissolve all the caramelized sugar.add your onions back to the pot and let reduce until you have a thick syrup,gos great on burgers..|`|qHOlnmCeaa	I would recommend checking on google - they have recipes for all sorts!     Why not try this link...  http://www.self-sufficient.co.uk/Make-Ca...    Caramelised Onion Chutney    Onion chutney requires only a few ingredients - onions of course (any will do, but red onions give the nicest colour and sweet taste), a vinegar - sherry, red wine, or balsamic are all ideal, and brown sugar, together with some bay leaves and peppercorns for flavour.    Chop 6 large onions as coursely or finely as you like and heat with a small amount of sunflower oil in a stainless steel pan until they are soft. Add 3 cups of your chosen vinegar (or a mixture of vinegars) and 3 cups of brown sugar, and drop in a couple of bay leaves and 15-20 crushed black peppercorns. Bring the mixture to the boil and then simmer gently for 1 to 1 1/2 hours until the onions have gone translucent and all the liquid has evaporated.    Pour the hot mixture straight into small (200g) sterilised jars, seal, and store somewhere cool and dark or in the fridge. The chutney should keep for at least 6 months. To ensure the chutney can keep even longer (1 year plus), put the sealed jars in boiling water and simmer for 15 minutes. Line metal jar lids with greaseproof paper to protect them from the vinegar in the chutney.    Chutney should be left for 4-6 weeks to mature allowing all of the wonderful flavours to develop and mix.      Chutney Recipe Variations    Additional ingredients can be added to this recipe according to your personal taste. A couple of garlic, cumin, thyme, redcurrant jelly, cloves, sultanas, mustard, apple, and tomato puree all work well. Add a tablespoon of cornflower to thicken up the chutney if desired.

eeRLckg5aa	I was told once that if you want to gain weight eat watermelon...the water is good for you, but its full of sugar. Like everything else its good in moderation. If you want to loose weight try eating twice the veggies as you do fruit. Good for you on the daily hour workout...wow! I'm lucky to get in 30min a day.|`|bpyx92GZaa	watermelon is nothing but water Hon..|`|AA11280073	Watermelon contains minerals, fiber, and vitamins but your diet is seriously lacking what you need to stay healthy. You need protein, carbs and other essentials. Please check with your Dr. for a healthy diet.|`|z1RmCqBbaa	uhh you can try to cut back on the melon and eat it with different fruit co you won't get tired of it. like make a healthy fruit salad and you can try different fruits and have water melon, too.
qvl3PjdEaa	Out of those meats I would have to say Duck. Duck I have only had once but it is wonderful. Chicken is too widely used and there are still many different ways Duck can be used.    Goose I have never tried an seems to me less used than Duck.    Turkey I find is rather dry unless cooked properly or cooked in a sauce or wine.    Either way I'm sure all of these meats are delicious.     I think I prefer Duck. It has a richer flavour an could be implemented into many dishes that even chicken uses.|`|tLI94qWNaa	I am a vegetarian so I dont prefer any meat, but I do love soy products :D|`|WMem5AGoaa	Chicken because it's versatile there's so many endless recipes for that meat, and it's especially delicious when it's barbecued.|`|KkSW6EViaa	meat is murder.    :)|`|sj3HJ5jZaa	chicken, also turkey is my favorite.  never try goose or duck|`|ecf745aba8f13419e7e6191b8a4c14d4aa	Well, I believe they're all the same.  They're both flesh and insides from living beings with everything humans have: emotions, reproductive systems and nerve endings.    Meat is meat no matter how you slice it.  Besides, that would be poultry.  I prefer soy and tofu products.  They're 100% better for me, for you and our environment.    Answer Girl|`|nEZNf91saa	I like pig the most but its not on there|`|8MM2LTrraa	goose - its delish|`|6I1LFlSIaa	hmmmm, i'd probably go for Duck because i just think it is tasty  Chicken would be second because it goes with everything  Turkey would be 3rd because it is too dry, no matter how much gravy you put on it it will always be dry lol  I can't say goose because i don't think i have ever tried it before.|`|d5abd43b2147ab853d2ec674d4a74280aa	I prefer Duck.  First, the breast of a duck is very easy to cook and is tasty.  If you make a whole duck in the oven, put a rack in the pan to allow the fat to drip down.  If you remove the skin after it's cooked, it's really not fatty or greasy.|`|newfiOPOaa	Either Turkey or chicken when I do eat meat, which is seldom.  The white meat has very little fat in it.  A lot less than a steak hamburger or pork roast.|`|PZg9r0WYaa	Hey    I would prefer Goose or Duck because I never ate it. Worth to try. :) These days we eat more meat then in the past. Not that everyone of us needs it. Only people that work hard with their whole body, not after a desk, needs the proteins of the meat. So if we did take this in consideration we would need less animals for our meat. So less killing them. :)))
