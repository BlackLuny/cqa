20090203073913AAcXlNs	Education & Reference;Financial Aid	So I just got my Fafsa results, i didn't qualify for a pell grant..?	I checked my Sar on the fafsa website and it said that i didnt qualify for a pell grant and that my EFC was 8500.  It didn't list anything that i did qualify for.  So now what?  Does it take awhile for it to find other things i might qualify for or once it says that i didn't qualify for a grant does that mean that is all the information they are going to provide?  I really really want to go to college.  My mom has been single mom for 13 years of my 20 year life and she doesn't have the money to help me with college, and i don't expect her to.  I live on my own but i am still considered a dependent because i am under 23.  I am near tears and i feel like this whole stupid college, financial aid system in America is set up to make the poor stay poor and the rich stay rich.  If somebody wants to go to school, that's what should matter, not their income.  My mom makes 38K a year before taxes and i have a job that i make 22k before taxes.  We aren't exactly rich.  I'm just really depressed and would like some suggestions of how i can get student loans.  Are there any scholarships for children of widowed parents? Please help.

20070618183208AAGS67E	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Are you good in understanding poems and English? If so please help me,10 points best answer!?	I had eight birds hatcht in one nest,   Four Cocks were there, and Hens the rest.   I nurst them up with pain and care,   No cost nor labour did I spare   Till at the last they felt their wing,   Mounted the Trees and learned to sing.   Chief of the Brood then took his flight   To Regions far and left me quite.   My mournful chirps I after send   Till he return, or I do end.   Leave not thy nest, thy Dame and Sire,   Fly back and sing amidst this Quire.   My second bird did take her flight   And with her mate flew out of sight.   Southward they both their course did bend,   And Seasons twain they there did spend,   Till after blown by Southern gales   They Norward steer'd with filled sails.   A prettier bird was no where seen,   Along the Beach, among the treen.   I have a third of colour white   On whom I plac'd no small delight,   Coupled with mate loving and true,   Hath also bid her Dame adieu.   And where Aurora first appears,   She now hath percht to spend her years.   One to the Academy flew   To chat among that learned crew.   Ambition moves still in his breast   That he might chant above the rest,   Striving for more than to do well,   That nightingales he might excell.   My fifth, whose down is yet scarce gone,   Is 'mongst the shrubs and bushes flown   And as his wings increase in strength   On higher boughs he'll perch at length.   My other three still with me nest   Until they're grown, then as the rest,   Or here or there, they'll take their flight,   As is ordain'd, so shall they light.   If birds could weep, then would my tears   Let others know what are my fears   Lest this my brood some harm should catch   And be surpris'd for want of watch   Whilst pecking corn and void of care   They fall un'wares in Fowler's snare;   Or whilst on trees they sit and sing   Some untoward boy at them do fling,   Or whilst allur'd with bell and glass   The net be spread and caught, alas;   Or lest by Lime-twigs they be foil'd;   Or by some greedy hawks be spoil'd.   O would, my young, ye saw my breast   And knew what thoughts there sadly rest.   Great was my pain when I you bred,   Great was my care when I you fed.   Long did I keep you soft and warm   And with my wings kept off all harm.   My cares are more, and fears, than ever,   My throbs such now as 'fore were never.   Alas, my birds, you wisdom want   Of perils you are ignorant.   Oft times in grass, on trees, in flight,   Sore accidents on you may light.   O to your safety have an eye,   So happy may you live and die.   Mean while, my days in tunes I'll spend   Till my weak lays with me shall end.   In shady woods I'll sit and sing   And things that past, to mind I'll bring.   Once young and pleasant, as are you,   But former toys (no joys) adieu!   My age I will not once lament   But sing, my time so near is spent,   And from the top bough take my flight   Into a country beyond sight   Where old ones instantly grow young   And there with seraphims set song.   No seasons cold, nor storms they see   But spring lasts to eternity.   When each of you shall in your nest   Among your young ones take your rest,   In chirping languages oft them tell   You had a Dame that lov'd you well,   That did what could be done for young   And nurst you up till you were strong   And 'fore she once would let you fly   She shew'd you joy and misery,   Taught what was good, and what was ill,   What would save life, and what would kill.   Thus gone, amongst you I may live,   And dead, yet speak and counsel give.   Farewell, my birds, farewell, adieu,   I happy am, if well with you.

I am a sophomore in high school, enrolled in the following classes: Honors Math, Latin, Honors English, Honors Chemistry, Science Research, Honors Italian, Honors Global History. My GPA is a 4.0; my overall average is currently a 97.6 but fluctuates between a 96-98 throughout the year. I recently took the PSATs and got a 196 (not too great, I know) - this grade is equivalent to a 1960 on the SAT. I got a gold on the National Latin Exam last year, a bronze in a county Science Fair (my project was on Genetic Engineering) and a bronze in a county Math Fair (my project was on Integral Calculus). I will be taking IB courses next year and senior year, and am striving to achieve the IB diploma. My strengths are math and science. I volunteer at a nursing home, and volunteer a period every day in an office at my school. I am devoted to the following school clubs: National Latin Honor Society, Environmental Awareness Club, Future Educators of America.      My goal is to get into Cornell, study Biology or Chemistry for 4 years, and hopefully get into Med School. I want to be a pediatrician. :)      Do you think I stand a chance? I've been doing some research and I know Cornell is a highly selective school. I know I still have a year before I need to worry about college stuff but I want to be ready. :)

I'm not the greatest test taker & standardized test taker, but I was planning on going to this early college called Bard College at Simon's Rock. I would apply next year. I wanted something to stand out from everyone else. I'm not the greatest science person, but if I study I think I would do fine. I usually get like C's on the tests, but I get lots of A's and B's too. I know lots of you will say why would you want to do this then? Well, I think I could do it and I will try my hardest.       I also think I like this semester better. That's why I would take E and would do better at that. I have a 84% now, but I think I could get an A. Is there any book for me to study for this, I saw one for US History & World History but not Biology? Also, are these subject tests like the AP Exam? Is the AP Exam a lot harder? I was also going to take AP World History next year. If I do that, should I just take that subject test too? I would think I would take the test on the June date, and we get out at the end of may. I rather take it now, because I will forget some of it later on. How do you register, and what's the cost? Is this a hard test? I haven't taken any SAT or ACT test yet. I will take the PSAT next year though and have a book from Kaplan. Is the test similar to the AP exam? How do I study? Should I do it, what's your feedback. Thank you!

Jobs are requiring science or engineering training will rise. In the other countries, China graduated 500,000 engineers in 2004, and India, 200,000. The USA graduated 70,000. For an instance of China, they have a strong school curriculum and try to make math and science as standards. That’s why Chinese students are one of the top students in math and science.,On April 25, 2007, US senators passed the bill called as S. 761, the America Competes Act. This was an important bill for the education because in included important issue about education related to math and science. The legislation focuses on three primary areas to improve American competitiveness in the 21st Century. It highlights this; first,  increasing research investment, strengthening educational opportunities in science, technology, second, the engineering, and mathematics from elementary through graduate school, and  the last thing is developing an infrastructure that will enhance innovation and competitiveness in the United States. This bill shows that math and science, and efforts to support them, are vital in keeping Americans educationally competitive. As I see this, government put a lot of efforts to develop the educational program of math and science. Through this bill, American government hopes that this will be impacted on education to lead a foundation of math and science.

20090203075356AAK2te3	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Why do girls always ask me for help in math class?	Hi. I am a 27 year old guy going back to community college for my associates of arts to transfer over for a 4 yr degree in biology. I am in intermediate algebra right now. A class in which I placed into after being out of high school for 8 years. I was always good with science and math. My question is though. Why do girls that sit around me in class always ask me for help? It's not that I really mind but, they do it while the professor is teaching the class. I wouldn't mind helping them with something before or after class. Especially this girl that sits right next to me. She is asking me something every other example. I just don't want to give the wrong answer to something they expect me to know even though I might have not gotten it the first time around my self. Does this this happen to anyone else in college?

My mom and I have entered all the correct information into my FAFSA using her W-2's, bank statements(for taxable income) and information that we already had on there from last year(which is the same). Is it alright for me to say that the tax returns are completed on the FAFSA instead of "will complete" even though they're really not yet? I'm positive we have all the correct info on the FAFSA already.

She has been coming first in my class for years. I really want to beat her and make my parents proud. But no matter how much I try, she always ends up beating me. If I get 18/20 for a test, she gets 20/20. She never makes any mistake in anything, everything she does is perfect. I really really want to beat her. I know that nothing's impossible, but with her, I actually think it's impossible. My sister comes first in her class every year, so there's a lot of pressure on me to beat her. But since she's been comin 1st since preschool, she's a professional it seems really hard (impossible). pls help!!!!!!

20090220165610AA3yRP2	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	What should I major/minor? I'm confused?	I am going to be a Sophomore in undergrad, and suddenly I have a change of plan. I am interested in 3 fields of study and am not willing to let either one of them go. This includes Clinical Pathology, Psychiatry, and Journalism. I know there is A LOT of schooling for Clinical Pathology and Psychiatry. I am not willing to let go of Journalism, because I've always dreamed of being a Foreign Correspondent. If I had to choose between Clinical Pathology or Psychiatry, which one should I go for? Is it possible for me to do a double major? Or perhaps minor Journalism and major Biology for either Clinical Pathology/Psychiatry? (Maybe it is too much work?)       I like to work in various environments and like new tasks and challenges, and I'm a very, very curious person. I like to do research, promote my ideas, and furthermore help people. I have excellent/unique writing skills and research skills. I am very good at helping people with mental health.      What do you think I should do? Any ideas? Thanks! =D

20090220165732AAN9oXE	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Simplifying Expressions: I REALLY need help?	Hi,      Step by step instructions on these problems would be greatly appreciated, I have to simplify the following, thanks for any answers, I will choose a best answer if someone explains themselves thoroughly enough. I really do need help, at school we start a new unit every two days, and we jump back and forth between chapters like crazy. Now, it's finally driving me crazy to the point where I don't understand how to simplify what's below, and solve some equations that are below.      √242=11√2      For anyone that's having trouble reading it, it says the square root of 242=11* the square root of 2. How I got that, I don't remember,      √153=3√77 Don't remember how I got that one either, I did them by myself, honest, just don't know how I got them because I wrote my answers in my workbook, this assignment was due today, but my teacher was nice enough to give me an extension.      5√24*2√28= 10√672, but I don't know how to simplify it from there.      √8*3√40*√3- not so sure      √10*√14- not so sure      √24*√80/192      √121/225      √7/9*√4/7      √24*√80/192      3/4+√5      -6/5-√11. I know that has something to do with something called a conjugate.      7-√7/10+√3      EDIT: No equations   Thanks so much!   Isabel
