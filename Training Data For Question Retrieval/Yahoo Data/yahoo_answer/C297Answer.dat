AA12203329	This is why liberals don't mind raising taxes....THEY DON"T PAY TAXES SO WHY DO THEY CARE!!!|`|YW1DXceqaa	Obama promises to bring change to America. this all sounds to good to be true and it is. Here is the reason why.    First he keeps saying that he will help fight poverty. But he wants to use a socialist tactic called Wealth redistribution or Economic Justice. This basically means take from the rich and give to the poor. Increase Taxes for everybody and every family who makes more than 20,000 a year. But I bet you did not know what really happens to the counties that have already tried to do the same thing.    Let us take for example Russia. Almost all the Educated Business men left Russia, many years ago. Now there are only 2 types of Rich people there: The corrupt Politicians and the Russian Mafia. The Russian Mafia are those guys that Kidnap children and then they drug them and sell them to local pimps as prostitutes.    Watch the action movie called Taken and you will learn something new. All the other Rich Russians live in other non socialist countries like the USA, in places like Miami Beach Florida etc.    For more Socialism look at France, Spain and Italy, the same thing happens, all the rich people leave and the only ones that stay are the Mafia. Oh and do you think the mafia pays taxes. Well if the Rich people leave and taxes cant get collected, then where do you think the money comes from?    Somebody has to give the money to the Poor in the form of Welfare, Food Stamps and Free Hospital care.. So you can take it from the Middle class and then the middle class either leave, or become poor too. So now with too many poor people, things like crime, corruption, drug traffic and the mafia become more popular. If you do not believe me send your children to live alone in Europe.    But be very careful or they may never come back. So do you want this same change to happen to the USA? Go ahead then be a fool and vote for Obama in 2008!|`|FZKFLTyLaa	What does one expect when one continues to put lawyers in elected positions?|`|Ir51Eb0Kaa	I want Obama to send us all a huge stimulus check asap!|`|I6dcRgD6aa	You must not be used to being around people who have integrity. When someone is clean they don't run a place like Bush did with all the people who screwed up & he smiled while people died & said "good job, Brownie". After Bush left office Ted Haggard came out & told how he was part of what was going on every day in the white house. Which would you rather send your child to a house that only takes the best or one with Ted Haggard hanging around. Yes, we can this is change we can believe in.|`|ZFTkBTvvaa	i love that kind of change, we actually got a politician to pay taxes    WAY TO GO OBAMA|`|tiahE3a8aa	change babay|`|SB2gbgusaa	Eh.

I love classical music and opera, as well as some popular songs (though few and far between). Basically anything that talks about substantive issues, set to any mode or tone.
aNMZHg0qaa	Post some videos on Youtube.  I know it's a long shot but try it. Rin on the Rox are a singing duet and they got the opportunity to go on Ellen because of the amount of views they got on their channel.  Bo Burnham is the same he is a comedian but with luck Youtube helped him and he does shows all over America and even came to England to do so.    You could also try putting forward your band at an open mic night in clubs. My friend's band played at a club and from there they get asked to do others. They also entered a local battle of the bands competition and won a chance in a recording studio to promote their band.    Create a myspace or facebook page to promote your band and add dates that you're playing a gig so your friends and their friends can come and support your band.    I hope this helps, and good luck with your singing career!
urIm4YaBaa	Volumes 1-2: Peter could absorb the powers of other people just by being near them. This "power sponge" ability is his original power.    Volume 3: Peter's father took away all of his abilities. In the finale, he injects himself with the formula.  This only returned his original power; it does not appear to have given him all of the powers he picked up along the way, so he can't turn invisible, he can't paint the future, he can't throw lightning, etc.     After taking the formula, he immediately came into contact with Nathan, thus re-acquiring the ability to fly.    Volume 4: We can't say anything definitive yet because we've only seen one episode. It appears that:  1 - He now needs to come into physical contact with people in order to use their powers.  2 - He may not be able to switch between powers or use more than one at a time anymore. He *might* have lost flight the instant he absorbed Mohinder's super strength...we really don't know yet.|`|gERaZGZeaa	The biggest power Peter has is "the power to forget how powerful he is".  Seriously, the dude is a friggin moron.|`|AA11464088	He has all the powers Syler has but he doesnt want to become like Syler bc they crave more and more power and become something they dont want to become. So he has to watch out so he doesnt become...dun dun dun...a villan|`|eX7An0AKaa	He lost all his other powers when his dad did whatever it was. I believe like you said his power now is basically the same as before, but he has to touch them now. And i think he can fly, be very powerful, and now the ice thing. Atleast i think that's all there is cause he hasn't done anything else. But if he can fly i don't get why he didn't stop the plane from crashing so i'm confused as well. :)|`|jriTPpdhaa	I was confused as well.  The only thing I can figure is that he lost his original power which was just to be around somebody to absorb their power.  Then he took that super power serum and got this new ability which he has to use by touch, kinda like Rogue from X-Men.  If this isn't it then the writers just jacked up his character.

I'm going to quit asking them if this keeps up!|`|ab1c9b81d36c3691f0d575d773009489aa	"Lithium"...because Nirvana is my favorite band and I can't seem to get into the Rolling Stones =/    BA1: Saturday  BA2: hmm...sweet and sour chicken  BA3: bread  BA4: pretty good...I fought the urge to skip class this morning, went to the gym and got a good workout, had lunch with my roomate, checked my bank account balance and found out I had $1500 that I didn't know I was suppose to get...yeah, a pretty awesome day.

9Iy69I3Qaa	i. love. blonde jokes. which people find weird because im a natural blonde. haha.     a cop was sitting on the side of the road in his car when he sees a car randomly swerving all over the road. he goes and pulls the car over only to find a very pissed blonde in the drivers seat. he asks her whats wrong. she says "every where i turn, there is a tree right in front of me!" the cop is obviously confused seeing tht there are no trees on the road. he asks wht type of tree. "its this hot pink tree every time!" the cop looks inside the car. "umm.. ma'am, thats your air freshener?"    a blonde, brunette and red head all died. before they could go to heaven, they met with an angel who said he had to test them first. he would tell 100 jokes, and in order to go to heaven, they cant laugh. on the 28 joke, the red head laughs and is sent to hell. on the 63 joke, the brunnette is sent to hell for laughing. when the angel finishes his laust joke, he looks at the blonde and says "congrdualtions! u get to go to heaven"  all of the sudden, the blonde starts laughing. he asks "why are you lauhging? the jokes are over" she said "i finally got the first one!"    a man was outside mowing his lawn. his attractive blonde female neighbor walks outside, down her driveway, to the mailbox, and she opens it. she frowns and slamms it shut only to walk back to the house.  about 5 minuted later, she walks back outside, looking agry this time, and does the same thing to walk back into the house. after the 5th time, the man stopps her and asks "im sorry miss, i couldnt help but notice what you have been doing. can i help you in something?" the blonde says "no, its ok. its just that my computer keeps telling me 'i have mail; but my mailbox it empty"  the man walked away speechless.    a brunnette is driving down a country road. she sees a farm with lots of sheep. she gets out of the car and walks over to the farmer. she asks "if i can guess how many sheep you have, can i keep one?" the farmer said yes. "94" she said. and to his shock, she was right. she took one to her car. right before she was about to pull out of the driveway, the farmer walks over to her and says "waut, now its my turn. if i guess your nautural hair color, can i have my DOG back?"    i know. that was 4, but i just love them. lol|`|02lXYAOPaa	As I was walking to St. Ives, I met a man with 7 wives, each wife had 7 sacks, each sack had 7 cats, each cat had 7 kits (kittens).

AA10289523	Normal Marvel continuty Galactus is MORE Powerful after all he created the Surfer , the surfer never killed he just tried to but failed    On Earth 552, Norrin Radd had been a great military scientist who accidentally destroyed his own world with his greatest invention. Determined to bring it back to existence, he approached Galactus, Restorer of Worlds, and became his herald in the hope that Galactus would resurrect his world in exchange for his service. However, Galactus had taken an oath to only revive those worlds destroyed by the Blight. An enraged Silver Surfer then turned against his master, destroying those who worshiped him and attempting to kill Galactus himself in order to steal the knowledge of world restoration. This led to the destruction of Earth, the coming of the Exiles, the deaths of the Shi'ar Imperial Elite Guard, and inevitably the Surfer's own destruction at the claws of a cosmically empowered Sabretooth.[70][71]|`|SX8z4fNtaa	i say he is because theres ben plenty of alternate realities where surfer killed him and it wasn't another reality were he was stronger just ones where the circumstances were changed|`|dfjIBHe3aa	No.  Silver Surfer is NOT more powerful than Galactus.|`|AA10741291	Sounds dubious as the dickens to me.    Galactus raised Norrin Rad to cosmic power level, true.  But G wouldn't have given him *that* much power more than he allowed to remain for himself; he's not that short-sighted.    Plus, he had to have allowed a reserve to have raised the following heralds to approximately the same level as the Surfer.    Whether or not he ever gave the succesive heralds as much as or more than the Surfer is not indicated in anything I've read, but I'm behind on some of my comics reading.    Where was this article published?  How recently?  Who wrote it?|`|720a3c208ab442188c3c8cf9ed346f7eaa	Galactus, out pips the surfer anyday of the week, its true that the surfer was technically his strongest herald - I remember reading stories where he beat subsequent heralds in fights.      But the only charatchers that I saw beat Galactus in a straight fight were the celestials...

NQ3XZElFaa	It's catchy.    Who cares if it's done by computers? A computer is no less of an instrument than a guitar. I still don't know why people care about talent. Was Woody Guthrie talented? No, not particularly. Was he one of the greatest American folk musicians? Almost certainly.    A lot of pop music is awful, but a lot of music in general is awful. Plenty of pop music is great.|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	because the typical person just takes what the media throws at them, they don't know any better. pop music is catchy and easy for people to remember so it gets stuck in peoples heads and they wants to listen to it again. it's the disgusting money making cow of the music industry swimming in its own sh*t.|`|BBsR8hwLaa	Herd mentality. Enough said. Unfortunately, many of the professed modern 'metalheads' automatically gravitate towards bands that possess pop qualities. Some examples would include: Dimmu Borgir, Amon Amarth, Lamb of God, As I Lay Dying ,Killswitch Engage, Avenged Sevenfold, and the castrated entity known as In Flames. If you profess to be 'underground' just because you like any of these bands, you are no better than the bubble gum chewing shallowminded guidos that plague this filth covered fungus we call the 'modern music industry.'|`|ebxwADDcaa	becaus they listen to the radio and not what they want to.     i know people who just listen to stuff because they want to look good for other people|`|VMUwtGCuaa	i like dance music and pop music.|`|FgahTFoMaa	get a life  but i hate it too|`|eSSf1tztaa	because it gets some ppl pumped like metal and rock get me pumped|`|B4M9pG81aa	F*CK pop listen to HEAVY MEATAL!|`|siz5uRL3aa	Idk.. i listen 2 alternative|`|sBcNXAU4aa	becausee they find it stimmulating   i personaly prefer rock/heavy metal/dnb|`|PF6yKkVDaa	I hate pop too, but please try to be a little less ignorant. People have opinions on music like they do on politics and, as far as I know, they are allowed to listen to any kind of music they want. It also takes no talent, and a computer as well, to sit on a computer and hide behind some avatar and screen name while you ridicule things you don't understand.
y8WBcehmaa	maybe The Boogey Man    or it could be the (awful) 2002 movie "They"     synopsis: "While preparing for the examination of her Master Degree in Psychology, Julia Lund is called by her friend from childhood Billy Parks to meet him in a bar. They both had nightmares when they were children, and Billy is totally disturbed with demons from the dark that would be chasing him and commits suicide in front of Julia. The traumatic experience, plus the meeting with two friends of Billy, Sam Burnside and his girlfriend Terry Alba, in the funeral make Julia having nightmares again. When Sam tells her that they four have been tagged in their childhood, and demons are coming to get them to the darkness, Julia becomes afraid of the dark and asks for help to her boyfriend Paul Loomis"    I really think it's that one.|`|JuUwhegqaa	Lets see Monster movie theater 5 or scarry movie 2|`|b2952b6264919c4d0478fc6d9b014e95aa	The Booggy Man|`|2Emij9rlaa	Im thinking its Boogie Man.

fb3dd3fee54f8b05cc6ac9ae9d500a06aa	are you sure this is a song..... it does not rhyme|`|PBCAL3wPaa	Well, lyrics are no good without music, first of all. You should start with music and end with lyrics. Second of all, don't ask me! I am a random person! If you are in a band, give it to them. If not, don't even write lyrics yet! Seriously, get a band, unless you are solo, in that case, write some music.     Specific to what I have read, it is quite absurd. People are harsh unless they are close to you. Your family will probably lie to you, so don't believe what they say unless you know they are critical. The lyrics are simplistic and many people will see "blood" and be like, EMO! But anyway, it starts out very bad for a song. Songs do not have to make sense. You don't have to start out in a setting.     Write a poem first, if you want. Or just find something you feel adamantly. More often than not, people like songs that sound cool with words that don't specifically connect to each other, but still flow, rather than stories.     I am a songwriter myself, by the way. I am a drummer and a singer and I play a little guitar, so if you take no solace in anything else, just remember to listen to other musicians similar to you.|`|dDDAbqqhaa	Good...        except it doesn't rhyme or make sense|`|cFPQVavVaa	pretty good!|`|0oiz1hySaa	they are really good && i love to sing alot|`|3u4HU7rdaa	uh if it's for choir or church i guess.  but if you're starting a band, please it's not the way to go.|`|rMtS7jNuaa	ohhhh... that's beautiful|`|rKAJtwl4aa	ok...|`|0VHzP9jzaa	genre? pretty decent, im assuming its rock. little twisted but its good|`|m6P9BNWFaa	OMG that's soooooooo good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|s3pkflYdaa	I like it =D|`|86692840fce86f8a24dea58512123d09aa	its really powerful... the 1st verse doesn't really rhyme tho... but its ok if the instruments make up 4 it... also I really like the 2nd verse, its really good, it reminds me of "janie's got a gun" by Aerosmith, which is a compliment cuz as old as they are, they kicked butt back in the day whn i was like 2.|`|cunWqoVqaa	GREAT =)  & answered your qustion & i was completly honest can you comment my blog with what you think ? thanx|`|kktoXldiaa	Wow those are some deep lyrics!

y8WBcehmaa	Atonement!    that is such a good movie...    thanks for the thumbs down? Atonement is set during World War II, which started in 1939.|`|S4W7FojCaa	Through None Gone with Me. It's close, it's in the 50ss.    And Pearl Harbor has some romance in it but it's more war than romance.|`|GIl4rwXJaa	Well there are movie set in the 1940s and then there are movies made in the 1940's:    MADE in the 1940 ish:  The Philidelphia story  Sabrina  Bringing up baby  His Girl Friday  Little shop around the corner    BASED in the 1940 ish:  Great Gatsby  Atonement  The English Patient  Titanic      let me know what you think, they're all amazing pictures. ;)|`|zYQtUuzmaa	casablanca|`|ZyGyDLsDaa	Sayonara  The Clock  Comrade X   Casablanca  Dark Victory  The Lady Eve   Now, Voyager  Seven Sinners   Dark Passage  Hanover Street  Meet John Doe  Golden Earrings   Ball of Fire (1941)  Miracle in the Rain  The Lady Is Willing  The Heavenly Body  They Met in Bombay  The More the Merrier  To Have and Have Not  A Foreign Affair (1948)   Waterloo Bridge (1940)   Somewhere I'll Find You  Leave Her to Heaven (1945)   From Here to Eternity (1953)   Her Highness and the Bellboy  The Enchanted Cottage (1945)  Christmas in Connecticut (1945)   Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing  You Belong to Me aka Good Morning, Doctor  Lady of the Tropics (1939)~It's on the edge but is included because it's a wonderful bittersweet romance in which Robert Taylor and Hedy Lamarr are one of the most beautiful screen couples ever!    Some of these are dramas; some, comedies. There are even a couple of thriller/suspense movies. All of them are set in the Forties except for the final one listed. My family are the World War II generation, and I"m a Baby Boomer, so I grew up watching these movies or being told about them until they started showing on on early television.|`|sGESw6v0aa	The Summer of 42|`|iiRC1wBYaa	"An Affair to Remember".

NQ37mnWkaa	I *love* Joe Cocker songs, and his voice :)    I've never heard the original of 'Feelin' Alright', so thanks for that.  And I grew-up on The Beatles, but I also know Joe's covers. So let's see...      'With A Little Help from My Friends' = TIE  My favourite: 'Feelin' Alright' = Joe Cocker {Traffic sounded awful}  'She Came in Through the Bathroom Window' = Joe Cocker      And I'd like to add :~    'Something' = TIE  'Let It Be' = TIE   'Love the One You're With' = really depends on my mood. I have Joe's live version, which is amazing, and I think he just wins :)  'I Heard it Through the Grapevine' = Marvin Gaye {again, Joe's is a live version}  'The Letter' = another one that depends on my mood...    'I Put A Spell On You' = there have been so many great versions of this song {Screaming Jay Hawkins [original] ; Nina Simone ; Manfred Mann ; Bryan Ferry ; Natacha Atlas ; Jools Holland w. Mica Paris & David Gilmour}, but Joe is definately one of the best :)      I suddenly remembered this one in bed last night :    'Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood' = Joe Cocker  {The Animals were good, and so was Nina Simone, but Joe gives it more emotion}|`|YA4qCDukaa	same as you!!  the beatles   joe cocker   the beatles|`|394ff47f78f7ed3b7394395aaf14b639aa	I'm going to have to agree with you on the first two, but my list goes    Beatles  Joe  Joe|`|TaJPujL3aa	Agree with you on all three.    I think there's only been ONE cover of a Beatles' song that was better than the original Beatles' version and that was "Hello, Good Buy" by the JoBros. *runs for cover to avoid avalanche of TD's*|`|W4BvABL6aa	find little help.   beatles  very slight edge victory    Feeling Alright. Dave Mason with Traffic, Dave Mason's band, or Dave Mason with these guys; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJcIjG9N1...    She came in B window.  Joe Cocker      I hope for more respect for Dave Mason. Saw him a year ago, and he sings and plays just like the early 70's. unlike Bruce Springstein.|`|RC9guRCHaa	I PREFER ALL OF THEM AS THE BEATLES ! end of story.|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	The Beatles  Traffic  Joe Cocker   (I don't know why - it's just such a funny song and his voice makes it even funnier to me!)    P.S.  I love Traffic and Steve Winwood.  Don't hear much about them in R&P.  Guess I need to ask a question or post some songs.|`|3yvuMkzTaa	I feel that the way Joe performs those songs, make them completely different. They are the same song but Joe completely makes them his.  Also don't forget this song....  The Letter -Boxtops(original)  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQaUs5J2w...    Joe Cockers version  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RnjWLVyM...|`|MwSaCettaa	Beatles  Traffic  Joe    ???|`|ONWCXzUMaa	Beatles fans won't like me here, joe does a better job of it than even what the beatles do , he puts more feel into the song.    Feelin' Alright Traffic    Have to go with the beatles on this one  Bathroom Window    Take care  dave|`|VIhj7ghUaa	Joe Cocker.  Nobody plays a better air guitar or mangles the lyrics as well.  And have you seen this one? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4_MsrsKz...|`|dYyiG90caa	( nobody )  Traffic  ( nobody )    A. I think "With a Little Help from my Friends" is an extremely Pretentious song, no matter who sings it.    B. Prefer Traffic's Version ( but, Cocker does an Excellent Job with it )    C. One the most idiotic songs ever written -- An example of where "anything The Bealtes do, must be Brilliant !!  ZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzz................    Was Cocker's version of "You Are So Beautiful" a Cover ??    To me -- That was a Well Thought-Out Composition -- Wonderful Song !!  .

26e1b99c52b8488a8109c1f532ad3a59aa	Yes I do.  I just always thought so.  Plus Diana always said it felt like there were three of them in the relationship, referring to; Herself, Charles and Camilla.   So maybe Charles just got sick of her.     I think it's a shame we lost someone so beautiful, and sweet like that, so early in her life.    C00l QUESTi0N.|`|PpWosZsIaa	No, it was all due to idiot Photographers who wanted to make millions after selling pictures of The Princess and her new love.|`|grifjdr0aa	I do.  All that bloody saying bloody.|`|CX2pfYqdaa	They know more than they are letting on.|`|16rD9k32aa	Absolutely.

They are lower than freaking scum.|`|uwtvDgxCaa	No but it is traggic as hell what happened......I think it's totally the paparazzi's fault.|`|AA10910187	No I don't I did a huge paper and scrapbook about her for school and I really don't think so. like it seemed that they really liked her....|`|jxUYdSLwaa	Not at all, the picture taking asswipes that hound celebrities caused the accident.   I'd like to pop a paparazzi!|`|AGl4ifkLaa	Actually they had two bloody hands in her death. Queen Elizabeth is a english gangster....|`|dBtFTxjRaa	No.  I don't think they would stoop that low.  They had nothing to gain from it.  She was divorced from Charles.|`|QGBSOpt7aa	I'm not sure if it was the royal family, but I definately think there was a cover up.  The white paint and the explosion prior too leads me to think something is fishy.

KrWTHrveaa	Yes, Underoath is a Christian band. Their record label (Tooth & Nail) is a Christian label.

Not matter how award-winning it would be, do you actually think that it would be the same? Don't' get me wrong; I loved the O.C. and hated when it went off the aire, but it just can't  be brought back. By the way, Kirsten was my  favorite character. She was so complex. It was great.|`|5e078b550b17c8d663fd621560c00169aa	I love the OC, but they already told us what happens in the future, and actually wrapped the show up.

First, this publisher is OLD OLD OLD - most of the stuff is ancient and out of fashion, even among us old-school teachers of the classics.  Second, WHAT INSTRUMENT is this the accompaniment for?  Third - probably, it is still copyrighted - so you are asking us the break the law.  And even if it were NOT -  why should anyone here f give you for free, that which we paid for, legally?  What do you have at YOUR house, that I can come over and take?

I'm just too lazy to chase down links if you are already in the know....    Mahavishnu Orchestra  Billy Cobham  Return To Forever  Larry Coryell and Eleventh House  Herbie Hancock and The Headhunters  Frank Zappa  The Flock  Dreams    I focused on Jazz-rock here.

I assume you have the First 5 "Henry Cows" ??    How about Diving Head First into FRENCH SYMPHONIC Prog ?    Much Darker & Gothic, than Italian Prog -- and Mixes French Folk as it's "Base," the same way that GENESIS mixes English Folk as a "Base."    Any of the ANGE Albums - from 1972-1979 -- and especially Surprising and Extraordianary --    Ange returned to it's Symphonic Roots with "Culinaire Lingus" (2001)     Just to give you a "Barometer" of Where I'm coming From --    My Favorite French Symphonic Prog is "Au-del du dlire" (1974) by ANGE.    The next 2 Great French Symphonic Progs would be, the Bands --    MONA LISA & ATOLL.    Less Symphonic, but totally Prog -- the First 3 "PULSAR" Albums.    More "Industrial" but Still "Old School" Prog --    HELDON's -     "Allez Teia (1974)" ( very Fripp & Enoish ),  "Agneta Nilsson" (1976) ( their Most Ethereal )  "Un Rve Sans Consquence Spciale" (1976) ( Just Awesome !! )  "Interface" (1977) ( their Most "Noisiest and Industrial" )    Richard Pinhas -- "Rhizosphre" (1977) ( the Fripp of France ! )    I do hope that you find Something Here that you do not Have.    If NOT -- You may have Reached the END of the PROG SECTION :))    BTW -- DO NOT PURCHASE -- The REMASTER of Froese's "Ipsylon in Malaysian Pale" !!!!!!!!!!!!

NCMZy6Uqaa	Absolutely not.  Go ahead!  I was a flute student before going to Uni, and there I had to start piano for technical purposes, like harmony and counterpoint classes (at 18). It was one of the best experiences I had. I don't know why, but piano gave me a very different level of satisfaction from what I had playing flute. I still play both, but when feeling for a musical break in my daily life, I always sit on the piano.  And now, years later, I'm starting to learn a Japanese instrument (shamisen)...go figure.  It depends on how much time you dedicate to the study, but in a year you could be playing pieces by J.S. Bach, which are fun to play and beautiful to listen to.  My only suggestions are: enjoy, don't be afraid of the instrument and get a teacher which whom you feel comfortable.    BTW, I made the reverse road, and now I'm an engineer (and was scared of math and physics after spending years playing the piano)...so I strongly believe that science and music do indeed go well together .|`|rHCVpXw9aa	ok. u can learn anything at any point in your life, but when your a child your brain is developing so therefor you can learn quicker and easier.   ur good at math, which is a good thing, you could listen 2 songs and try to pick out the piano parts.   just practice a lot and dont give up ;)  good luck|`|5hIVsBx8aa	of course not! it is never too late to learn something new. if you're intersted in it go for it. i would suggest either getting a teach yourself piano book or getting a teacher. I hope you enjoy the piano as much as i do|`|eKyPgEBXaa	Holly, I applaud your interest in learning piano.  As others have already stated, it is never too late!    By all means, do study with a teacher.  You will advance more quickly this way.  Music and Math do go together so be hopeful about things.  I have a close friend who studied Advanced Organ in her 60's and is quite an accomplished musician.  All the best, Julian of N.|`|sc4BtGxGaa	GOOD FOR YOU!!!!  I have been a professional musician and certified teacher since 19791 - 3 degrees in music - and applaud ANYONE who wishes to study and instrument or voice.  Get a good teacher - you will do SO much better than trying to slog thru blindly on your own.  The parts of you brain that paint, and the parts that do math, will meet in the middle and assist you in learning both the technical and expressive skills you need.  Can you read music already?  Get a jump start - go to www.practicespot.com and start learning to read treble AND bass clef.  I wish you much luck!  You can get a decent 88-note keyboard for not much money (not the same as a piano, but a great way to start).  Try an M-Audio - 88 - the run under $400.|`|Ea9A4yHNaa	I have played piano for many years. I never learned proper fingering techniques until I was almost 24. Had my same lesson around that age, too. It's never too late, but it can be harder. Stick with it.|`|8957886d1feff9a3887d10f0913afa4faa	Better late than never :)|`|Po6Bhqfoaa	I was reading the answers to your question and found them very encouraging.      I hope you take up piano. You cannot go wrong doing that. It cannot harm you. You may find you have  hidden talent.      I love math/ algebra/science/writing. . Some very talented artists in my siblings.  Have some who play  musical instruments.Never thought about that being related to my playing  music.    I am an older female. Started playing a little over two   years ago, seriously trying to get my mind off things.  Have long term love of music.  In spite of much  interference from many things  I have learned quite a bit of theory,  and can now actually play. I have no teacher,would  love one for guidance, hints, etc.  Someone objective.  Someone to push me.   (Not a phantom, but a  real teacher but I am doing  fairly well.     The good thing about a teacher is that if you go  weekly, she will point out mistakes, flaws,   bad habits soon. Easier to change.     As young as you are, if you work at it, why not?  Can't lose.      I found a wonderful book which has scales, chords, progressions, cadences, arpeggios for each key.  Each key has a two page lay out. Wonderful book.  The name is guess what?  "The Complete Book  of Scales, Chords, Arpeggios and Cadences"  by Alfred. Cost $8.,50 found it on line.  I also love the one Benner theory book I have. It has  worksheets.  Oh well your teacher will tell you that.    I have always felt like people thought I was slow  and stupid. I have delighted in learning to play music.  I found I really enjoy playing in front of people.   I am not an exhibitionist, but I love to play for people.  I am getting better and better, progressively better.    If you begin don't get discouraged. There will be times when  you will feel really intimidated and exasperated   (probably) and think you are getting no where, and/or what  is the use.  I have had many of those and I always  have a major breakthrough right after. No. I am  not Mozart, nor his sister, and will never be.. Neither is anyone else.    Expect some criticism or discouragers or even  making fun.   Who cares people do that because of the way they  are, not how you are. Keep on . In two years or sooner you will know how to play piano, they will know how  to mock or make fun or criticize. Who is the winner?|`|hUYaaXBvaa	well i play piano and my mom wants to learn  i think that if you have the patience to practice and learn the chords, then you'll still be able to  i'm 20, i've been playing for 12 years, but i'm still not as good as i could be, i just have to practice  so its never to late to learn, you've just got to be dedicated and you'll continually improve  you may not be super proficent for atleast 2 years, but if you continue to practice you will sound a whole lot better  and one thing, if anything learn to count well (the notes)  that is my one weakness and it's very important that you get that down to play well|`|d4Kcwk7Yaa	no, it's never too late to learn an instrument, as long as you put in the time|`|ryOH781Maa	No, I am 19 years old and I was very interested in piano so I began taking lessons a year and a half ago.  Im not going to lie it was very difficult at first but dont give up.  I have now memorized some expert songs from both classical and modern day music and can read piano sheet music.|`|DMpVSHvXaa	It's never too late to take up an instrument.  Not being able to sing well doesn't mean that you'll necessarily be a bad pianist, and it certainly doesn't mean that you won't enjoy it.

bLAwx3uvaa	Don't worry, while a lot of people say you have to have a natural gift to be a good singer, almost anyone can train  themselves to be a decent singer. Well at least, sing on tune. First of all it may sound cliche but practice practice practice. Also, if you live with your parents, when they're away, you can practice loud projection in your house. (or if they are there and they don't mind the distraction) Projection is pretty crucial to reaching certain notes, and developing a nice vibrato. You can look up on youtube videos of how to breathe while singing, which is usually what helps you get a better tone. Those crappy singers on american idol usually have bad breathing patters when singing which makes their voice sound even worse.   Also, you may have heard this many times, but always sing from your diaphragm  (the muscle under your chest/lungs). Thats where your powerhouse is, and where you'll get the  best tone. Lots of people try controlling notes with their throat which can lead to A nasally sound, cracking voice, not full tone control and can even damage your vocal chords.  Drink lots of water and practice! Many famous musicians also say they drink a little bit of honey before singing.|`|Gv606uKbaa	one of the best ways to enlarge your range is to open your throat like you are yawning when you sing a high note. and dont scream it that will just injure you vocal chords and give you a callous.  to get good tone use more air when singing and open your mouth and throat wide.|`|c65EGrIkaa	practice when no one is home  hope that helps and try singing in the shower  start with DOOOOO REEEEE MIIIIIIIIIII|`|HvaaYDYwaa	have you ever tried breathing exercises to help you propel your voice without screaming or loosing your voice? i was n choir and we did this. suck in air for four counts, hold it for one then blow it out, trying to make it as loud as possible for 8 counts. at the end it should be as loud as the beginning. good luck n singing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Ow3O7h4caa	Hi    First, get a good stripping product to remove the paint carefully. Once this is accomplished, you need to sand the body down so that the primer will stick evenly.  Now you can burn it the way you like.    Apply Fullerplast varnish as the sealer. You apply it and it dries in 15 minutes. You need this if you don't want the wood to sip your coating and giving a blotchy finish. (NOTE... THIS IS THE BEST PRODUCT FOR HIGH  GLOSS FINISH . Fender & Gibson use this.)    Then, Van-Flex Moisture-Cured Urethane Clear Gloss as the final finish. This finish is fool-proof, scratch-proof, stain-proof etc...actually, the finish will be better than the original. Expect a super high-gloss finish and protector.    Note that it is better to apply very thin coats of lacquer (10 to 15 coats) rather than heavy coats. Sand lightly in - between coating.  You can bring it to a luthier. it will cost around $250 to finish the job and even more.     You can do it yourself with aerosol spray. Nothing complicated about it if you follow what I have outlined. You hang the guitar from a string so that you can move around and that's it.  If you are afraid to refinish it, then get it done professionally.
fEBOzWeXaa	I used to watch that series too and I don't recall thinking that it was abusive to the animals.  I think that in a drama like that, there are camera tricks that help and give the impression of certain things and then you own imagination takes over fills in the blanks.  I guess a good example would be a quick video shot of a horse, shivering a section of himself to chase a fly.  Cut the bit showing the fly and you have a horse with tremors.  Ditto with a dead sheep.  Teach him to lay down for a few seconds for an oats treat and you have a "dead"sheep.   Animals can be trained to do an amazing amount of things with the right treat incentive.  Also, there is an amazing amount of stock video footage laying around that film makers buy so they do not have to re film a bit.  You have  raised an interesting question though.  Things were a lot harder to do back then without all the computer graphics available.

8478b8de7e84637d2b4117c1696b3343aa	I do not want your 10 points.   You need to take the craft of singing more serious .  Try studying with a vocal instructor for several years who can train you to be a professional .  Also take courses in music theory and piano .  A singer will need music theory to read music charts and interpet what musicians are doing live and recording .  You cannot become famous or noticed being an inexperienced singer .  Even if you do make contact with someone in that industry they will be able to tell that you do not have the skills to suceed .  Also forget about record contracts because corporations are not investing the money in singers .  It takes well over $500,000 to 1 million dollars to produce and market a CD .  It seems like you want to be Micheal Jordan without ever dribbling a basketball .|`|rKNM4M3faa	in a few years you can go on American Idol...Loves it!    You can also use myspace to post videos.

Q5gxghVqaa	Number 1: The Office by a long shot.    The Office is my favorite show along with my sisters.  Every episode is too funny and I've seen them all over again on DVD. The characters are hilarious and the hijinks and outside the office occurences are always fun to watch.      30 Rock is also a good show, although this season the episdoe quality is way down from the previous 2 years even though there were 2 or 3 very good ones this year.  This year, they're making every episode to every other one center around a guest star and that only takes away from the show's previous classic episodes and continuing storylines.    And the thrid show sounds very interesting, but I could never get into it.  A show about karma should be a show I would want to watch, but it's not.  The Office will hook you and 30 Rock if you had watched it from the beginning.      If you haven't yet, you should buy The Office seasons 1-4 on DVD.  Seasons 2 and 3 are the best.  :P|`|s7gWSqV5aa	The Office. No contest.|`|23fe729840a0e15dbc1476704bdf1dfeaa	Earl  Office  30 Rock|`|ZeZqCJ05aa	My number one is office all the way.

bLAwx3uvaa	Well you can control your tone by changing your voice output. For the most part you're stuck with what you're born with but you can try different styles of singing that affect your tone in many ways. For example, if you suck at singing rock because you're tone just isn't right or you don't have a strong enough voice, you could try a more jazzy type style. By controlling your voice through accenting, hitting notes correctly and breathing right, your tone greatly increases.
XBGaYJ2waa	I like Smallville better,  I watched part of a Heros episode but I just couldn't get into it, so Smallvilles my pick|`|bdC6JcoSaa	I like Smallville better, just because of the humor and how they tell the story.|`|RqnID1s3aa	I like HEROES way better than Smallville now. Smallville used to be good, but now it's getting cheesy.|`|akcGfgdcaa	Although it has dipped in quality over the last 2 seasons, Heroes is still far better than Smallville.    Having said that, Smallville has been on a lot longer, and although I thought it would suffer without Lex Luthor, it actually managed to still do well.     But my vote still goes to Heroes.
Klw3Ke3Haa	I don't think so but I am not sure but you can probably try a blog site or use the power of google to find plenty of useful and helpful sites for you to use. Good Luck!|`|db8909ce0aa3e126b05d434349e29aa1aa	probably not. I have heard that it would cost more to get the copyright of the other ending and opening songs so they are probably just going to stick with the same one over and over and over
8pDblyCBaa	yeah I could totally see that. great.  Actually-no-the chorus should repeat it self and only be a few sentences long.

xzahKZdzaa	If Venus is in Leo in your chart it suggests a behavior that is theatrical, with a good deal of personal and social pride. Venus in Leo is warm-hearted and fun-loving, a natural showman with a need for self-expression. There is an innate need to be in the spotlight and center of attention.     You have much physical and emotional magnetism that attracts romantic interest easily. You thrive on these attractions and what they mean to your ego. Romance helps you maintain your high opinion of yourself. You are happiest when you are in love and when bestowing your gift of romance on a lucky admirer.     Glamour, excitement and charm mark your courtship endeavors. You are lavish with your attentions, presents, and with yourself. The Venus Leo in love is sincere and whole-hearted. You are one of the most romantic and ardent of lovers. This is an outgoing and affectionate position for Venus, as you truly love life and romantic drama.     You can be very loyal to those whom you think worthy of your affections, but you expect strong affections in return. Despite all the fun and show, you are an extremely stable and loyal partner. You are basically a one-love person because your pride is so wrapped up in your relationships. If there is a break in a serious relationship, it will most likely be a very hard and bitter one.     While you are innately faithful in love, you are not one to discourage or ignore other admirers. You love to be noticed and admired. You enjoy attracting romantic interest, though you have no interest or desire to follow through on these idle flirtations.      ~~~|`|PBCAL3wPaa	huuuuuuuuu? Venus is the love goddess. Leo is...a horoscope thing? Sorry I got nothing.|`|dibBENqWaa	it is good    This the describtion    With Venus in the sign of Leo, you radiate warmth and if you're not confident in love matters, you'll fake it 'til you make it. You've got a regal bearing and can be generous, affectionate and playful. Your persona is delightfully dramatic, and this can lend an air of excitement to your relationships.        You're drawn to colorful people, and find it hard to be with those that you find dull and lifeless. You are a generous friend who likes to be the cheerleader, encouraging everyone to follow their dreams. You go out of your way to make connections for friends, if you know it'll get them ahead in some way. You're the one planning over-the-top birthday and holiday parties, and you especially like being around kids    Your nature is well-suited to being a performer, but you could also shine as a dramatist or filmmaker behind the scenes. You're gifted at creating memorable spectacles, and might even turn this into a career. You like to be visible, and an active part of the human parade, so steer clear of isolated cubicles. The world of fashion might be the right stage for your talents, with the bonus of being able to strike poses, as well.     You're proud, a bit of a strutting peacock, with a tendency to toot your own horn. Confidence is an aphrodesiac, and you've got it in abundance. You're also genuinely fun to be with, able to be fully in the moment. You like to give spontaneously and have a naturally high-minded demeanor    Famous People with Venus in Leo:   Gwyneth Paltrow, Coco Chanel, Salma Hayek, Madonna, Marcello Mastroianni, Tom Cruise, Greta Garbo, Alfred Hitchcock, Nicole Kidman, Leonard Bernstein, Jeremy Irons|`|VgE6HSdtaa	Venus in Leo - Leo Venus      Venus in Leo indicates a thoroughly outgoing, affectionate, constant, ardent, passionate and warm-hearted romantic nature - devoted and loyal in marriage. You tend to shower extravagant gifts on the object of your affections, often throwing lavish parties just to impress. When you do marry, it is for love, not social, practical or financial gain. Your infectious love of life and noble nature ensures socially popularity, although, at times, you can be rather theatrical in order to hog the spotlight. You usually choose a partner you can show-off with, and proudly display to friends and colleges.|`|9ce71ec2e47cf221d521f594f76a23a0aa	Leo is a strong component in any chart.

Honestly, if you like someone, does it matter what time of the year they were born? No it doesn't, people are who they want to be, the time-of-year doesn't determine anything.     When people read their zodiac, they can fit any part of it to their personality, thats why so many people believe them. Try it, read any zodiac and you could most likely match it up to yourself, it a load of crap.|`|PuVgZiddaa	A Leo friend is loving and affectionate.  They are   the ones your most likely to receive presents from,    and surprises for those special occasions.  Their   friendship and personality gives off much warmth   and they enjoy making you happy.  Actually Leo   friends can be pretty insistent that you remain   happy as they will take it personally if your not and   show you their pouty, arrogant side that gives you   the cold shoulder.  Otherwise its all fun and games   and spending time with them is like an adventure      leos are only good with Sagittarius and virgo
QgnVXJnoaa	omg me too!     especially when you specifically put that in your question. Like, "please dont be a wet blanket..if you dont follow astro. then just STFU" yet they still have to be a pain and make it known they dont believe it. Obviously they find it interesting if they care enough to always linger around in here..|`|fXUlPjSIaa	I know. Every time I have a question in Astrology one or two people always act like smart a$$'s and tell how its fake. Well If it is so fake then why did yahoo put it on here? Seriously why do people have to be so critical, if it makes you mad and you don't think it's true then STOP COMING HERE!!! You only want to make yourself look intelligent and at the same time make yourself feel better by criticizing.|`|a4fb671bdeb9d97a5ca6b59c2e09d198aa	Lol. I think its because people like the fact that they can hide behind their computer and act like ignorant morons. The same happens in many sections on here, like the environmental section on green living. You will always get some idiots wanting to shout their mouth off. Let them waste their time... its a pretty funny thing to watch happen though, isnt it?|`|mL6ycTAhaa	Yeah, they need to get a life.|`|pQGUPITeaa	Yeah I know, category trolls are such a waste of space and most of the time they don't even answer the question.    Oh wait, that's a reportable violation ... um any ideas what to do about that?|`|Zx0V8d5Vaa	its fake,stupid and pointless :D    No problem :)|`|nxHjSKTTaa	Yes, it's silly.  There looking for a reason to complain.|`|M5XjqI40aa	Some people don't hang around in a particular section.

I got so ticked when i asked a question and this guy wrote this huge answer about how i am so dumb for asking that question and he kept going on and on about how fake this stuff is and he said "only weirdos are on this part of yahoo answers"  I was thinking, well your on here to buddy! whata fool,|`|qnBVKBJIaa	Yes I do, those kind of people just want attention.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Yeah it is annoying.

ybOeogUiaa	i think you were great! there is a quality in your voice that i loved.   the only thing i noticed was with your breathing. when you breath try to breath deep- almost like its in your stomach ( if you put one hand on your back and the other on your stomach you should be able to feel your stomach expand.).... if your breathing right your shoulders shouldn't rise, and i saw them go up a couple of times.   really good though! your voice is amazing, and you have great pitch and great timing! keep singin grl!|`|0D4q4Q2Raa	Not my style, but not bad at all.|`|qmi4Az4Haa	???? you are so small and your band is very interesting|`|023e4a8fafa700085b1d1986f48cf326aa	yes very good, nice pipes and i love bfmv!|`|EQydFhzmaa	Yes.

I'm sure you can improve as you grow. A little vibrato would makes you sounds better.|`|bJh1MesQaa	Great voice!
Z5mmaFK0aa	they are when you manipulate a note by holding your pick at an angle and dig into the note much harder to create an artificial harmonic. They make a "Screaming" noise. Then you can manipulate pitch and length of the harmonic by bending the note with your Neck hand on the note.     I use them ALL THE TIME in my Technical Death Metal interludes and songs in my own compositions they are very very popular in Technical Death Metal.    EDIT  here is one of my song samples without drums I posted it for some interested subscribers of mine. I use them on this song from 1:44 to 2:13 if you are interested in how I use them  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHCEJCwck...    Nevermind bro you have already heard this one yourself lol|`|pVTevFJgaa	I don't have an answer to your question (sorry!) but I got a related question... Are they possible in an acoustic guitar?    But I still starred it... maybe you'll get more answers.    EDIT: I don't know how to play them, but if you listen to Gojira, their main riff in Ocean Planet has a very high pitched bend, which I think is a pinch harmonic... As well as in other Death Metal bands...|`|DbtS5jzEaa	hopefully Shred swings by...he will help:)|`|7fEVNng5aa	Doesn't it involve a zipper and the male genitalia?|`|8oDAhb7Waa	when you pluck the string you immediately touch (very lightly) the string with your thumb (pick hand) (to clarify, you do it in a single motion), here's an example...     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5HHl-SQR...    and done a different way...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbIZIMeg-...|`|OoaJcZzgaa	pinch harmonics are a really cool technique      This video explains them --------> http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=5I5O8P-r5R...     thay take alot of practice, so dont quit early! once you master them, tey sounds so good!! good luck my friend!|`|ObeBvtzgaa	Revolution Is My Name intro by Pantera uses a ton of pinch harmonics.  And lots of Black Label Society/Pantera songs do.|`|Om24dMRqaa	Watch as many vids of Zakk Wylde as you can.  He melts faces and uses pinch harmonics.|`|0vm66wlcaa	Well, you put your thumb in a way so that when you strike the string, it slightly touches the string. then a high pitched "squeal" is produced. they are also called artifical harmonics and squealies.    Hard to describe. See the video in the Sources below

5QFuenebaa	I was disappointed 20 pack didn't step up to the plate and allowed Entertainer to run his show because it's one thing to be influenced by your commanders, another to just go with their decisions! BTW - why are Entertainer and Heat back??? Is VH1 invested in getting Entertainer out of his basement?     I personally think Buddha is a jerk, but he's also the strongest competitor on the show. I'm glad he's still around because it raises the level of the competition.

The other patient had surgery 8 months before, somehow cells from her uterus got throughout her body and made her bleed because they reacted to  her body having her menstrual cycle. Weird I know. Well they removed the "clots" and she was o.k. Thirteen and Foreman slept together again and Cuddy stopped torturing House and gave him his cane back.

I've also answered the phone while in the shower.|`|B5KR2Yjlaa	Yeah of course...  and I can't stop people from imagining things.  some I wouldn't mind...|`|CXYuaLtcaa	Ya I always say it, and no ive never felt uncomfortable with that, but i think its flattering if they like to imagine me.|`|F1d4i4WSaa	yea...it's not like your telling them that you have to go and have sex...lol|`|2DTJ6Yosaa	haha yeah why not?  i mean, everyone showers|`|B2ULG7izaa	lol that is really funny, but yes i do tell people and the thought about them thinking about me has never crossed my mind, but now it probably will all of the time! but usually if it's a guy they will crack a joke or ask if they can join... so it doesn't get to the uncomfortable part just funny.|`|aWknctzTaa	usually, i only tell my sis  and she's seen my nakey so i dont care|`|KVzBqWhvaa	On the phone? Yes
QCPddhlUaa	Hi Maria M,    I haven't seen Blood+ yet, but many people have recommended it to me because it's very similar to Vampire Knight.|`|EfLOc8K0aa	pokemon|`|ZhrL1Vszaa	but who is Edward?|`|CnM2U1bXaa	http://www.twilightfreakscz.webs.com|`|PBCAL3wPaa	Look at other clamp stuff. They are good, but i really do not care for them. XXXHolic might work. Kind of... Just look up your genre on the web. Like FMA. I like FMA.|`|Jf0s6pByaa	I love Vampire Knight! why don't you watch the tv series before just moving on.|`|P8gGMlbIaa	Vampire Hunter D  Tsukuyomi Moon Phase  Hellsing|`|KhNXZIWCaa	read twilightt, its about vampires but its not an anime. Its a really good story though for yound adults|`|2QSPkrakaa	rosary + vampire|`|8Jg7WQexaa	go to cruchyroll.com they have a complete list of animes but so of them are licenced|`|IQTEBeDEaa	Both "Blood+" and "Rosario to Vampire" are about vampires though the last one is more a comedy and has lots of ecchi stuff...    You should also try Twilight, it's not an anime, but it's about vampires and it has a decent story...|`|ID2AH1EBaa	Watch the Movie Blood, then Watch the Following Series Blood+    I also hear that trinity blood is quite good though I've never watched it.|`|pQgnR7qCaa	I don't know the anime "Vampire Night," but I do suggest viewing the following anime series:    -Dragon Ball  -Dragon Ball Z  -Dragon Ball GT  -Naruto  -Naruto Shippuden  -Bleach  -Inuyasha  -Pokemon|`|FK0Lc696aa	Vampire Knight...    -Blood Plus  -Rosario + Vampire  -Shingetsutan Tsukihime  -Fruits Basket (It might seem like an odd comparison, but both Yuuki and Tohru Honda have many similarities)  -Ayashi No Ceres  -Tsubasa Chronicles  -Zombie Loan  -Black Blood Brothers  -Elfen Lied      I chose anime that are not just similar in the whole "Vampire" story line, but in themes and character situations, as well.     Well, I hope this helps!

VjUqAZuUaa	I'm sure I remember reading that she would have loved to do another series but her contract only lasted a year and she wasn't asked to do another series. If that's the case, I think they made a mistake because I thought she was the best companion they've ever had and I was really upset about her ending! Another thing is that with Stephen Moffat taking over as writer, they might have wanted to give him a clean slate with new characters to do what he wants with. There have been rumors that Donna will return in one of the specials this year but I don't know if that's true. Hope this helped.|`|FQJtlMSlaa	Quit being Drama Llama!|`|gWlmU1KJaa	Often in Dr Who, the assistant doesn't stay on when the doctor changes, and besides, Catherine Tate has her own show which is probably returning, coupled with, there isn't going to be much Dr Who this year, just one special I believe, and coming back proper in 2010

So I would go with Taken.|`|Cm3ET5TQaa	taken for sure, push looks like sh*t|`|yqe0I5zpaa	Taken, it's a really engaging and intense movie. Liam Neeson is really good as well, it is one of the best movies of 2009 so far.|`|GhsqaXsdaa	Push looks good. I want to see it so badddd.!:)|`|fafd4d858e4fee9b87096037aab92978aa	Taken- I have not seen push, but it seems like it might rely far too much on special fx. taken is really cool. I didn't want to see it, but my friends were going so I went with 'em. I didn't want to like it but I did.  Lotta suspense and Liam is a total badass. If you liked the Bourne movies, you'll like Taken.|`|rn5xImvTaa	Taken.no go see Push,no Taken,or Push.Why not see both?|`|yWU57CLYaa	I hated the preview for Taken, but watched it any way and found out that I really enjoyed the movie.

XBYiHaWIaa	Yeah, what they said.|`|720a3c208ab442188c3c8cf9ed346f7eaa	Further to what people have already said that is true, the double bill release in the US had poor ticket sales.... The films were then split into separate films for the European market to try and improve the returns......     I don't know if they did the same for the Asia market..|`|XXo0uHcbaa	Death Proof and Planet Terror were released as a double feature called Grindhouse. As a tribute to old school grind house theaters.|`|SYWrUt7kaa	Grindhouse was a film released in 2007, which was two films put together. The two films were Death Proof and Planet Terror.    When people refer to Grindhouse, they usually mean the two films.|`|JlEucUVtaa	Okay, here it goes.  Death Proof and Planet Terror are two halves of Grind House, which is the movie that contains both of these films with two different directors, and fake advertisements in the intermission in between.    Grind House is made to be like the old Horror and exploitation films shown in double features in "Grind House" theaters mainly in the 70's.|`|NUc6Aw9Gaa	Grindhouse is a name for a theatre that showed exploitation films and B movies.     Quentin Tarnatino wrote Death Proof and Robert Rodriguez wrote Planet Terror as 2 seperate movies and they were billed under the title Grindhouse along with the 4 trailers.    So Grindhouse is the name of the double feature but the films were Planet Terror and Death Proof.    Hope this clears it up for you|`|rn5xImvTaa	Grindhouse refers to both Planet Terror and Death Proof|`|GGAgxzJNaa	Grindhouse is a genre of cinema most popular in the 70's-early 80's that Death Proof and Planet Terror both try to emulate.  Those two movies were shown as a double feature to celebrate that style of film making.
Lnrp5rYtaa	1 ) The usual ambitious, silent at times, analysis everything, boring if you dont know them, smart.    2) I think libra is more talkative if you dont find that annoying then you should be fine.    3) I dont know about the aquarius because I noticed along the middle of the relationship they start to get on each others nerves like big time. never seen a libra and capricorn together though.    4) Sometimes they look serious and have a strong chin.    5) Not really I just read the zodiac sign information, its cool to have a sign of your own.|`|6Au5FIYWaa	1) Very generally speaking:  Hard-working  Serious  Disciplined  Sometimes distant  Practical    2) You can get along with anyone you want regardless of their sun sign - for one, there is more to your chart than just your sun sign and other planets influence your personality and your relationships with other people, and for two, astrology does not dictate your relationships perfectly anyway as there is always free will and experience to take into account    3) Same again...    4) You can't really tell someone's looks by their sun sign, this is more owed to the rising sign and planets in the first house. However, capricorns, GENERALLY-SPEAKING, will be slim and serious-faced.    5) Pretty much never

They can't run a DNA test that soon. Besides, why would she want one? She wants to believe that it's JR's and not David's.|`|AA12336927	I agree with Bluerose, she isn't far enough along for that to even be an option.

And you know Adam is gonna ask for a DNA test... as much as he wants another heir to control he still knows Amanda is a slut...|`|jHDeIPEfaa	You can bet that as soon as the baby is born, either David or Adam will have a DNA test performed. I believe Jake will be the father even though I hope the baby is JR's.|`|8xdcBKfUaa	Bluerose is correct here. But you know how soaps are; making J.R. look like the obvious father is, well... too obvious. Personally, I believe that the baby is David's. But we'll see.|`|om4Szik7aa	I don't think there will be one right away and not the legal way when it happens. I am guessing she will have the baby, and then David will do a test alone without anyone knowing, and then go for custody or something and spring the papers in court that he is the Daddy.

EjX9p9dBaa	In Alien Resurrection Ripley is a clone.  The 4th Alien movie takes place years after the 3rd.  The scientists are trying to mix the DNA's of humans and the aliens to make a better fighting machine.    the answer to your second question is the hybrid Alien is again genetically altered.  The scientist were playing God and mixing DNA's.    Your last answer is Ripley is a clone then has her DNA mixed with the Aliens to give her better fighting abilities and skills.  Pretty much the scientists on the ship were doing a lot of things they were not suppose to be doing.|`|f5NFa55Laa	Okay,yes she "died" in the third one,but the company  cloned her.

It is cute to watch once though.  I would give it a chance and wether you like it or not, you will have at least killed the curiousity and moved on to other things instead of asking  "what if?"|`|Q5gxghVqaa	You must be asking because you're a fan of Abigail Breslin, Jodie Foster, the story, or the animals.  For me, I'm glad I saw it and it was worth seeing.  So yes, it's worth seeing.  It's more targeted for the younger kids than I thought, but that makes it better for family viewing.  The ending is a little too happy and "storybooky" but it's an interesting story.  The main character, Abigail Breslin, is good in this movie as she was in Little Miss Sunshine (one of my favorite movies, which is better) Jodie Foster is ok, just a little wacky and exaggerated. Everyone else is the movie dones a good job acting and making you care what happens to them. Also, the movie looks great on Blu-ray.

LvZB13obaa	HI there,     You can get a totally free birth chart explaining what all the planets mean and where they were when you were born.    So go and enter all your details at :    http://www.alabe.com/cgi-bin/chart/astro...    Hope you enjoy,    Cosmic Angel|`|eVt0qkT8aa	Not really - you're kinda similar to me, being a Cancer with Virgo rising and Libra moon. As a Libra, you're a balanced person who sometimes has trouble making decisions. Cancer rising, you're moody and sensitive, being skilled in nurturing others but tend to get sick of their requests. Virgo moon, you rather bottle up your emotions than to express them, and that you are your own harshest critic. ^___^;|`|9ce71ec2e47cf221d521f594f76a23a0aa	Haha...No...    Just a complex individual.    Well hey I have a Cancer Sun,Aries Moon,Aquarius Rising,and 4 placements in Leo...So I'm a perplexing one as well...

8iOmeSgjaa	The OFFICIAL age allowed is now 14-19 years old.  The printer made a mistake on our promotional flyers that went out this week.  I am one of the owners of Primal, so I should know.  Unfortunately, we can no longer allow 13 year olds.  The South Lyon Teen Club Ordinance is very specific in that it only allows 14-20 year olds.  We cut it off at 19, as it gets a little weird with 20 year olds mixed with 14 year olds.  I hope this clarifies things.  Sorry for the confusion...we'll see ya Friday!!!    Jeff LaFave|`|gKVqS4Kvaa	haha i don't know....the other answer seemed good to me seeing he's the owner and all...I will be there tomorrow though!!!!

I think its a perfect way of describing Jacob's feelings for Bella, because its about conflict and how he feels alone.  It can also be interpreted to be like Edward and Bella's relationship.

Summary:  The setting is feudal Japan in the far future after civilization has collapsed and mankind has reverted back to ancient traditions. The story begins in a desert village where a set of twins are prophecised to save the country from an age of tyranny. The boy - named Tatara - is proclaimed to be the Savior. And the girl - named Sarasa - just has the same face. Everything changes when they turn 15. After Tatara is brutally murdered by the enigmatic Red King, Sarasa must step into her brother's shoes and assume the role of the Savior in disguise. Thus our story, and the war between not only Tatara and the Red King, but all four nations, begins...     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basara_(man...    It really is a brilliant manga series!    +  +      Now and  Then, Here and There:    Shu is a typical Japanese boy, but has an unbeatable, optimistic and determined attitude. However, when he sees a mysterious girl with strange eyes named Lala-Ru up on a smokestack, he is soon pulled into a strange desert world. Shu soon discovers the true terrors of war, which includes genocide, brutal torture, hunger, thirst, and child explotation. Now Shu is trying to save Lala-Ru, as well as his hard earned, and often relunctant, new friends from the insane dictator, Hamdo. Whether Shu can possibly accomplish saving those he cares about while still holding up to his values remains to be seen.    http://www.manga.com/titles/now-and-then...    +  +    Kai Doh Maru:     FROM THE CREATORS OF BLOOD: THE LAST VAMPIRE FEUDAL JAPAN - The battle for the Capital city of Kyo rages as warring political factions vie for power against hereditary rulers. After the murder of her parents at the hands of her seditious uncle, a young girl named Kintoki flees to the mountains to lead a harsh life; she is renamed Kai Doh Maru by the local villagers. Rescued by Raiko, the Captain of 'The Four Knights' - honorable defenders who protect the peace of the city - she is raised within their group as a boy. Living among the Knights, she learns the martial arts and develops into a skillful samurai, becoming a permanent member of their team. Now, as a young woman of seventeen, she begins to discover new feelings of passion and love for Raiko... but she also discovers that these new emotions cause a storm of jealousy and rage in another woman linked to her past. Set in the political intrigue of Japan's Heian era (794 to 1192 AD), explosive action intertwined with a complex human drama are both brought to life in this atypical story of love, honor, jealousy and betrayal. Produced by the incomparable animation team at IG Plus/Production IG (Dead Leaves, Blood: The Last Vampire, Ghost in the Shell, Kill Bill) and featuring fully digital animation with elaborately drawn 3D backgrounds showcasing unique colorization, Kai Doh Maru takes you into a new and uncharted dimension of anime.  http://www.manga.com/titles/kai_doh_maru    +  +    Full Metal Panic:      Summary- Plot Summary: A sergeant by the name of Sousuke Sagara is assigned an important task. That of guarding high school girl Chidori Kaname. Sousuke is a military genius, gaining high rank at an early age, but because of his strange upbringing, he lacks social skill. Now, he finds himself as a fish out of water as he attempts to protect a girl from an evil organization and turn in his school work on time.   (There's some mecca in this, though it's not based solely on it)    +  +      Saikano:     Summary- Plot Summary: Shuji and Chise are two Hokkaido high school students barely starting a relationship with each other. Then, with no warning, a squadron of bombers from an unknown country destroy the city of Sapporo. All hope is lost when suddenly, the bombers are destroyed by a small red light floating across the sky. At this point, Shuji finds out that the one responsible for eliminating the enemy forces is Chise, who reveals herself as a cyborg engineered for mass-destruction.     +  +    Berserk:   --Ooops. I didn't see that in your Q. My bad.   *shrugs*    +  +    I know you said no Mecca, but I just HAVE to add Gundam Seed here. You can't name war anime without naming at least ONE Gundam series, and Gundam Seed is by far my fave of the Gundam anime/manga world.

AA12397801	Fushigi Yuugi----->the best romance anime out there...main character ,miaka, falls in love with this majorly cute guy, Tamahome, right away. Their love becomes stronger as the series progresses.    Genres: adventure, comedy, drama, fantasy, romance   Themes: Bishounen, historical, male harem   Age rating: Teenagers (May contain bloody violence, bad language, nudity)     Plot Summary: Miaka Yuuki, an average middle school student caught up in studying for exams, is sucked into an ancient Chinese novel titled "The Universe of Four Gods". There she discovers that she is in an ancient country in what is now China, Konan, and is to be the Priestess of one of the four gods, Suzaku. As the priestess, her duty is to gather the Seven Seishi of Suzaku, who are to be her protectors. Once they are gathered, the priestess will summon the god Suzaku and bring peace between the warring lands, Konan and Kutou. But it's harder than it seems. Along the road, many hardships are faced, as Miaka's best friend Yui Hongo enters the book and becomes her rival, the priestess of Seiryuu in the land of Kutou. Who summons their god first is up to the courage and skill of the priestesses and their seishi, as they meet triumphs and tragedies along the way.|`|AA11107214	Fuushigi Yugi is good|`|O2hmjOPyaa	Some of my personal favorites are:    Hakushaku to Yousei:  - The story is set in 19th century England and centers on a "fairy doctor" named Lydia. Her life takes a 180-degrees turn when she meets a legendary blue knight count named Edgar and his crew. He hires her as an adviser during his quest to obtain a treasured sword that was supposed to be handed down to him by his family.    Special A (aka S.A.):  - Hikari Hanazono, the main character, has always been second to Kei Takishima. While Hikari considers Kei a rival and somewhat of a friend, Kei loves Hikari. Everyone knows this, but she is too dense to notice. Their wrestling loving fathers first introduced them to one another when they were 6 years old. Assuming that she was the best in wrestling, young Hikari challenged Kei to a wrestling match only to be thoroughly defeated by him. Ever since that fateful incident, Hikari swore to beat Kei in school grades, a sporting event - anything. To do this she has enrolled in the same school as Kei since elementary. Now she attends Hakusenkan, an ultra elite school, that costs her carpenter father a lot of money. Hikari and Kei are the top two students in the school, with Kei holding firmly to that number one position.    Ouran High School Host Club:  - Haruhi is a poor tomboyish student at a school for the ultra-wealthy, able to attend because of a scholarship, and unable to even afford a uniform. One day, she stumbles across the decidedly peculiar but very popular Ouran Host Club. She tries to leave, but accidentally breaks a vase, and unable to pay for it, she's told that she'll have to stay and do odd jobs. That is, until they decide she would be more valuable as a club member. Not realizing she's female due to her appearance, they fix her up and give her a male uniform. She's an instant hit, so they decide to have her keep up the charade even after they find out the truth. Haruhi, being average almost to a fault, doesn't know what to make of the unconventional activities of the Host Club (or of the even more unconventional members), but having little choice, she plays along. Before long, real bonds are formed, friends made, and Haruhi finds herself accepted in a way she could never have been otherwise in this affluent school.    Nodame Cantibile:  - At a top music academy in Japan, Shinichi Chiaki's arrogance is matched only by his top-notch piano playing. But when Chiaki and the teacher get into a fight, he's demoted to the reject class. Chiaki is left to pursue his dream of being a conductor while surrounded by a bunch of loser musicians and one annoying girl, Noda, who has proclaimed herself Chiaki's girlfriend. It doesn't help that Noda, who insists on being called Nodame, lives right next door to him.    Fruits Basket:  - Tohru Honda is 16 year old orphaned girl who gets invited to live in the house of her classmate, the handsome boy Sohma Yuki, and his cousins, 16 year old Kyo and 27 year old Shigure. However, these young men and parts of the rest of their family (both close and distant) hold a curse; if they are hugged by the opposite gender, they transform into animals of the Chinese Zodiac. Everyday is an adventure for sweet Tohru, as she gets to know everyone in the large family better (especially Yuki and Kyo), in both common and bizarre situations. But, the Sohma Family curse is certainly no laughing matter... it also holds horrible cruelty and heartbreak.|`|6PSnZDhDaa	I know what you're talking about... All the romance that are there are all harem, ecchi types... The only one that found really good, almost life like is Nana    The main characters are two girls...

TO READ: http://www.onemanga.com/Ouran_High_Schoo...|`|fJt5zRTXaa	You'll love the list of animes I got for you! ^^  (** HIGHLY recommended)    Lovely Complex (Or Love Com for short) **    Genre: Slice of life, romance, comedy    Summary: Risa Koizumi, taller than the average girl, and Atsushi Ootani, shorter than the average guy - their constant bickering and comical love-hate relationship is well-known throughout the school. They act similarly and love the same music, and their friendship is full of laughing, shouting at each other, and of course, lots of jokes about one another's height. But when Risa notices her feelings for Ootani growing, she's worried. She doesn't know if he can ever see her as more than a friend. With her friends rooting for her, she struggles to make him see how she feels about him, and that a romantic relationship between a tall girl and a short guy can work. Oblivious Ootani doesn't make things easy for her, but she stubbornly perseveres in her own unconventional way, determined for her feelings to get through to him, and finally be returned. If only she could do it without driving herself and everyone else crazy in the process.    You can watch it here: http://www.animefreak.tv/watch/lovely-co...    Peach Girl **    Genre: romance, comedy    Peach Girl is about an average high school girl, Momo Adachi, who everyone thinks is a beach bunny / **** because of her tanned skin. The actual reason she is so tanned is because she was on the swim team and tans very easily. She likes a boy, Toji, who she heard only likes non-tanned girls. This causes her to question who she is and have low self esteem. She spends a lot of time trying to remake herself into the girl she believes he wants. However, she has a friend, Sae, who likes to go behind Momo's back and make her life terrible, mostly by trying to take Toji away from her. All the while there's another boy, Kairi, who is in love with Momo.    Fruits Baskets **    Genre: comedy, romance, fantasy    Summary - The story begins with Honda Tohru, an average high-school girl, who has led a very unfortunate life. Her father died of an illness when she was young and she has recently lost her mother in a tragic car accident. She is left with virtually no family except her grandfather whom she lives with for a time, but eventually he has to remodel the house to accommodate for more people. Thus, Tohru becomes homeless and lives in a tent in the woods while going to high school and working a part time job in the city.    One day as she's walking to school from her home, she comes across a house in the woods and something catches her eye. She sees 12 eggs with symbols for the Jyuunishi (the Chinese Zodiac) painted on them. She remembers the story of the animals and suddenly a young man appears followed by one of her classmates, Souma Yuki. After school and work Tohru is returning home when Yuki and Shigure (the man who owns the house) happen to be walking in the woods and see her entering the tent. They insist that she come to their house, and later that night a landslide buries her home making her homeless once more. However, her luck is about to change when she is invited to live with the mysterious Souma family and begins to learn of them and their secrets...    Kare Kano    Genre: drama, comedy, romance    Summary - Yukino Miyazawa is really, really vain, and loves to hear people praise her. She's always been the best at everything, and always tries to look perfect. But when Yukino goes to high school, she's finally upstaged--by Souichiro Arima, who scores better on the entrance exams and instantly snatches the attention of the class. By accident, Arima finds out that Yukino is just pretending, and this starts off a series of events that lead to Yukino and Arima falling in love. They then have to cope with a lot of obstacles in their relationship.  Yukino Miyazawa, the Queen of Vanity, is the 'perfect student' - smart, pretty, athletic and has an overall nice personality. What everyone in her school didn't know was that behind the perfect facade lies a different person. She is always the best in anything - but an obstacle comes her way. The obstacle's name is Souichirou Arima. Souichirou Arima is chosen as the representative of the freshmen, not Miyazawa. Thus, she strives hard to defeat him in all aspects. But a day comes when her most-hated enemy comes to find out her secret. From treating Arima as an enemy, friendship blossoms. Soon love comes. Kare Kano is a story that revolves all around the pangs and beauty of first love.|`|IQTEBeDEaa	Vampire Knight  Lovely Complex  Shugo Chara  Kamikaze Kaitou Jeanne  Sailor Moon  Clannad|`|FtUM2tABaa	Well heres my anime list.

akcGfgdcaa	Lol, yeah definitely true about the man boobs. Also, have you noticed that when he walks, he only swings one arm back and forth, the other stays COMPLETELY STILL! Seriously, watch it next time they show him walking!    I think most of the time he tries to be honest, and is usually very funny, but everynow and then he'll just play up to the character of being "the rude one" and he'll just be an a.s.s.    He's still the best judge on there though!|`|yJCLcFVwaa	For the ratings.

Well, um, not for nothing, but it is HIS show. So I think he has the right to be critical about it, if he doesn't want it to fall to pieces.

7d866ea2a2dff3d3d77ce1b12a4e11c8aa	I was shocked, to say the least!    It is evident, he needs anger management counseling, asap!    He has a history of being irate!    Anytime a grown man hits his mom & sister, makes me wonder, what he'll do next.    His name needs to be Christian Ballistic!|`|gWLhIoIiaa	yah hes a psycho|`|JV445FR9aa	yeah... that was pretty freaking crazy....|`|1hciyvKdaa	I saw that on tv last night, they had that audio, it was amazing. But in all fairness if him and the DP are having issues, who knows. It should would be a creative advertising tacktic wouldnt it??
PzAyT7Vwaa	that was funny as hell. So he blows up at a guy for making a dumb mistake, I still think he's an awesome actor.|`|wB5dk84Jaa	he's a douchebag, but i'm a fan of his films.|`|YrHuv1g3aa	Hahahahha, LMAO|`|yqe0I5zpaa	He is like that, he gets angry about things. He is very complex and irritable. He also got angry when an interviewer brought up that The Joker was the main reason Heath Ledger died and also when his mothe kept constantly bugging him for 300,000 dollars, he is just like this. He isn't a bad man, he just doesn't like when things go un-planned or unecessary things are done or said. This event doesn't surprise me at all.|`|hgFkJOTPaa	yes, I heard it.  He's dumb and arrogant|`|AcmfbJVpaa	yes  the man is an *** actors like him think that they are good and they are not|`|azUGjQXuaa	eehh. i can careless how these people are in real life. i pay them to entertain me in the movies, i've dealt with worse with CEOs and executives.|`|15251965e7a22606112c1db04af6445faa	I DONT CARE BOUT HIS MELTDOWN HES STILL A GOOD ACTOR|`|0zr5YEJ6aa	no, nut i LOVED him in the batman movies i cant wait for the next one!!!!!!!
EglOlgnxaa	Woohoo, I'm a virgo   I didn't know that many ppl disliked virgos, but oh well. Life goes on. Besides, It only matters if you care.|`|byB1GEWQaa	Elaborate please|`|6FWWpnbpaa	As each horoscope covers 1/12th of the year, then statistically, 1/12th of the population should be a Virgo.     By the rationale of everyone who believes in horoscopes, that would mean 1/12th of the population behaves the same, have the same personality traits, and that this particular 12th is hated by everyone.    ...are you serious? Honestly, think about it for a sec.|`|igI5yX0vaa	A virgo can pick out the microscopic flaw in your new clothes, hairstyle, etc.|`|7ee11f32ce402e558134b3f3e6323823aa	I don't hate Virgos, I don't really hate anybody. And I don't judge a whole group of people..everyone has ther assets and faults..it's just the way it works.    I've heard those Cancers are pretty shady though....     ;-) lol jk|`|AQwoCjj3aa	They are to picky and kind of rude, and so normal it makes you want to barfffff!|`|IYNDaQ2taa	They're only disliked if they believe in horoscope things.|`|farhj0Kiaa	I actually like Virgos. They have this secretive side that I love. They are kind of strict but everyone needs a bit of power over themselves.    Im a Capricorn and we are compatible!|`|4KT1cXMBaa	I Love Virgos, they are the sweetest people once you've known them for a while. They will open up to you. I find that alot of my Virgo friends are messy people with their homes and life situations, but not their looks.|`|pkWX3rbPaa	people only hate people who obsess over horoscopes.|`|UtYOwE4Laa	gawd. enough with the horoscopes. ITS ALL FAKE.|`|175ydQo5aa	Im a Virgo and we are the best, thats why other people can't handle it.|`|QgnVXJnoaa	I know people are going to take offense to this but..in MY EXPERIENCE virgos are too much of a worry wart for me. And..they like to complain too much for my liking.|`|ga9hDAmTaa	im a virgo and im more loved than hated but ppl may envy you more than hate you and its more likely not because your an virgo|`|fXUlPjSIaa	I have one friend who is a Virgo and the other, not so much. Virgos are usually very critical and picky, that offends/annoys people. Virgo's are also very matter-of-fact and never miss a chance to say "told you so" . But these are only the general Virgo's there are always exceptions. But don't worry I don't hate them and people hate Aquarius's (my sign) too. Maybe they just know a person who is one and judge them by that one person. But don't let it get to you. Virgo's are very intellectual and usually succeed in life, so you will come back better than all of us :D|`|ykIleAQ7aa	Ha! I don't know, I mean when I was younger I used to not like Virgo's that much. But truthfully when I really thought about it I didn't have a good reason not to like Virgos. I think what people do is read all the negatives about Virgo and for some reason stick to the negative side of them. But I used be good friends with a Virgo and she was a great person.|`|a9vbJeOzaa	I can't stand them! Virgos are just crazy in the head.  I think Virgos think way too much and that causes them to be insane in the membrane.  Especially always over analyzing people and situations.  Virgos think they know all about you, but their analysis is usually wrong.  Since they think they know all about you, they tend to rub you the wrong way.  Virgos don't like to be judged or criticized, but they are the ones who do it the most!  They need to stop contradicting themselves!  Virgos are worriers by nature, they tend to be concentrating and obsessing about their problems, rather than trying to find a solution.  Also, Virgos are stubborn and always think their way is the best, but guess what?  It's not the BEST!  Open your minds, Virgos will receive the most criticism from people and take it the wrong way.  When in reality, the people who are passing judgment are actually trying to help.  They are truly considered virgins because they are so naive about the world.  They need to stop complaining about how bad their lives are, stop judging people, and stop being too paranoid!|`|bm5rxpgfaa	when i originally opened this i thought it said virgins but yeah i was fooled good job OP|`|vgDk8oxQaa	I'm a virgo..and as far as I know I'm not hated..well hopefully
mJmG3i4Oaa	My virgo friend is very picky,likes to spot your weaknesses, and likes to critisize.! She's full of herself sometimes, but hey it's good to have good confidence. She doesn't defend herself when she needs to. She's quite sensitive but doesn't really show it. Kinda like a scorpio. But she's very loyal,dependent,sweet,kind, and generous.! =]|`|d9hzMrzwaa	im a pisces and i dont get along very well with virgos|`|nxHjSKTTaa	My dearest friend who is very similar to me is a virgo. She is loving, kind and sensible.  She is very supportive.  I learn alot from her.  I am always teasing her about her thoroughness ( I don't think that's a word). She is my neighbor and one day she was out there organizing her trash in the recycle bend. As a scorpio I would never think of that.|`|Ym5VqC7paa	Because we're the best.|`|XdMcYDgbaa	Now I am a Gemini. Virgos criticize a lot I mean a lot...but I still love them.  Even if people say we do not get along. I just admire them. And I kinda feel sorry for them cause they are always misunderstood. They do not get credit for their wise judgments. I think lots of people are bothered by them cause they tend to remind us that we need to get better. They are very good at spotting our weak points. I just love those guys. They are like old Germany lol.
7uHOkuAfaa	they're my second favorite band. i like the sound of the way we talk better, but i love can't stop won't stop too. their personalities is what makes me love them anymore. and the fact that they post sooo much on buzznet.  seeing with we the kings and then on the AP tour  i'm pretty much obsessed, but in a not creepy way|`|UD93qolxaa	Horrible and generic.|`|bisoCJSnaa	mainstream, gay.|`|ZxmxjBE8aa	I like them. :)|`|KhGkc2QGaa	they're really good. They'll probably going to be one of those bands that blows up and becomes really popular. I really want to go see them on the AP tour this year. I'm just worried that they've hit their high point and their stuff will start to sound more pop than rock. that seems to happen to a lot of bands. But for now I think they're awesome.|`|64bb3632b681d600845c2019bcfe14eaaa	i used to like them. but i kinda stopped after a while because most of their songs get annoying fast|`|4ObhfxoIaa	I don't like them.  All of their songs sound the same and they get annoying real fast.|`|gJ8F634Haa	I hear the lobster is very good there. hehe

HpWyrJKGaa	chef?|`|bdb965e3f355169aff1feae8ee90d4b6aa	Culinary or Baking cakes or pastries at a cake company or a local store or maybe at a local restaurant.    In the career department, they are better working by themselves than for someone else. Their sympathy equips them for careers in charity, catering to the needy, as a nurse, looking after the sick, or as a veterinarian, or caring for animals.    Still others are creative cooks and chefs. Because of their versatility and plasticity, they often follow several vocations during their lifetime.

This is pathetic.|`|AjE9Dy4Laa	1 If you(a guy) is in love with Rosie(a girl), that would make you straight/bi/whatever, but that wouldn't make you gay.   2 There's nothing wrong with being attracted to her. I personally, think she's icky and very unattractive, but that doesn't make you wrong.   3 Yes, it is possible to be gay w/o knowing it, but that has nothing to do with your attraction to her..|`|gWLhIoIiaa	DISTURBING

aJp3BbWcaa	Maybe mars in cpricorn   Mars in Capricorn  Energy levels: high practical energies. Adequate physical and mental energies. Adequate to low emotional energies. Type of energy: predominantly practical, attainment-oriented, sustained. Energy often channelled into: planning, overcoming feelings of being unloved, organising. Strengths: respectful, ambitious, responsible. Lacks; friendliness, sense of humour, humility.    You probably started planning your career while still in your teens... or even before... because you have a tremendous amount of ambition. You like to be in charge, too. Although you have quite a bit of magnetism, you are not a particularly warm person and can be quite aloof for a long time while you are seeing if others measure up to your standards. And when angry, your coldness is enough to freeze everything in your path. You are well co-ordinated as a rule, and not averse to physical activity and hard work.  You have a strong, but often well-hidden sex drive, and can be an excellent lover once you finally trust your partners... and yourself. You tend to have very specific sexual wants and sometimes are not terribly comfortable with these. You are also very demanding of yourself in terms of putting your partner's satisfaction before your own. One of the lessons Mars in Capricorn men seem to be forced to learn at their parents' knees is how to be a good sport or a good loser. Carried into the sexual arena, this means they will generally yield quite politely and agreeably to a woman's demands. However, if this does not give satisfaction for them, they may start to be resentful and, instead of speaking up (real men are ALWAYS satisfied if they satisfy the woman), they may start seeking out women they can use for sex and sex only. Which usually only serves to compound the problem by making them feel guilty... which makes them try even harder to please their significance other at the expense of their own needs.    Women with Mars in Capricorn tend to be logical about sex. They see it as a need that can be attained. They do not generally confuse sex with love, and they tend to be "good shoppers" who know their rights. All of which sounds terribly cold and unromantic. Unromantic, maybe, but these women once committed... tend to be both very warm and very wise.|`|3WItFAwlaa	Your question is a bit confusing.  Long periods of celibacy don't necessarily equal a low sex drive.  It could mean a person values quality over quantity.      Earth and fire signs are more concerned with the physical act. Water signs more with the intimacy.  Air signs are more intrigued by the idea of sex.  I'd have to go with air signs as the lowest sex drive.  Of course, I am not talking about Sun signs.  Mars is the sex planet.  Mars in an air sign is the least interested in the act of sex.  Talking and fantasizing about sex are often enough for them.  They have large porn collections.  They find the actual doing a bit distasteful.  Other factors in the chart will influence this.    Look to the 8th house for clues about sex life.|`|d2dkgYRaaa	Hmmm...I'd think that possibly Mars in an earth sign, squaring with saturn in an earth sign as well. Possibly Saturn in an air sign as well. That could be an indicator. I'm not really good with aspects, but this is my guess.|`|EUL3Sm7Jaa	I know for me, on average, I have a pretty high sex drive. Things like stress at home, work, or school greatly affect my sex drive, making it impossible for me to come. Also, having a poor relationship with someone that you know you care about (such as a sibling or parent) can have the same negative reaction. What I did, was started talking to others online about ideas of how to cope (just like you are doing) and it gave me tips on how to not stress as much and become more comfortable and open up in bed.

aPOfW4lzaa	Mar 21st - Apr 20th     Aries is the first Sign of the Zodiac, and that's pretty much how those born under this Sign see themselves: first. Arians are the leaders of the pack, first in line to get things going. Whether or not everything gets done is another question altogether, for Arians far prefer to initiate than to complete. Do you have a project needing a kick-start? Call an Aries, by all means. The leadership displayed by Arians is most impressive, so don't be surprised if they can rally the troops against seemingly insurmountable odds -- they have that kind of personal magnetism. Arians don't shy away from new ground, either. Those born under this Sign are often called the pioneers of the Zodiac, and it's their fearless trek into the unknown which often wins the day. Arians are a bundle of energy and dynamism and the Pied Piper of their people. The dawning of a new day, and all its possibilities, is pure bliss to an Arian. It's the Ram which symbolizes Aries, and that's both good and bad news. Impulsive Arians (and there are more than a few) might be tempted to ram their ideas down someone else's throat. If things get done for the greater good, that might even be okay. It's those times when an idea is force-fed by an Arian for no apparent reason that we wish this Sign's symbol were a more subdued creature. No go, since these folks are blunt and to the point. Along with those qualities comes the Arian's sheer force of being which can accomplish a great deal. Much of this drive to the finish line has to do with the Cardinal Quality assigned to Arians. Cardinal Signs love to get things going, and Arians exemplify this better than the rest.         Arians are ruled by the Planet Mars. Taking a peek at Roman mythology, we find that Mars was the God of War. Our man Mars was unafraid to do battle, and much the same can be said for Arians. These folks are bold, aggressive and courageous. They can summon up the inner strength required to take on most anyone, and they'll probably win. Arians do not lack energy or vitality, and they can stay in the game longer than most anyone else. Now that's a winning edge. Rams are also, for the most part, independent and well aware of their own interests in a given situation. This sometimes myopic view may not be for everyone, but it does help Arians get things going. Further, their competitive natures ensure that they will play the game with zeal and vigor. At times, their approach may be construed as arrogant and domineering, but it takes a lot of focus to be a leader (or so an Arian would say). Sadly, the Arian won't usually be around for the final victory (defeat? never). These folks will more than likely have bolted to the next project before the first one is done.     The Element associated with Aries is Fire. Think action, enthusiasm and a burning desire to play the game. Arians love physicality, so they won't sit on the sidelines for long, if at all. They'll jump into the fray full force and will contribute much in the process. Talk about eager beavers! Sure, some of their decisions may later prove to have been hasty, but you'll never find an Arian who regretted taking a shot. Making things happen is what it's all about to these folks. Arians are also unafraid of stepping onto new terrain. The challenge inherent in taking on the unknown is heaven on Earth for Rams. Sure, they may appear arrogant when they take on the world, but they'll be quick to tell you it's the only way to go. While a common Arian refrain might well be 'me first,' there's no point in arguing with them since, in their minds, they are first. Is this unbridled ego? Maybe, but that might be what it takes to blaze a new trail. Oh, and on the subject of arguing, it's the Ram who will have the last word, so save your breath.     Arians at play seem to toil as hard as they work. These folks are happiest playing a spirited game of soccer or engaging in the martial arts. In the game of love, the Ram's ardor is unquestioned, although Arians can also be playful and romantic with their mate. With Aries ruling the head, face and brain, those born under this Sign need to be on the lookout for headaches and are well-served to take the occasional deep breath. The Ram's color is bright red, a sure sign of the fire that breathes within.     The great strength of the Aries-born is in their initiative, courage and determination. These folks love to get things going and are fearless along the way. Their dynamism and competitive spirit add considerably to the projects which they undertake.           Here you are:    http://assets.kaboose.com/media/00/00/0c... !|`|dn2tsXlBaa	I'm Ares-- whoooo    thats all i know srry :(|`|7Jsibcnpaa	Determined Fighter  The emblem for Aries is the Ram, a determined fighter and a powerful adversary, with a strong urge to express himself over the widest possible field of endeavour. Is the grass greener on the other side of the hill? Of course it is, isn't it, Aries?     Creative Aries, a cardinal sign, loves to be the leader and can organise fantastic and impressive ventures. Unfortunately, despite your desire to be the front-runner in all you do, sometimes you do get bored with the whole affair and can just wander off, or sit back and allow the lesser folk to have their way. This can see the whole house of cards collapsing, but happily your enthusiam is easily roused and when you set your mind to it you can inspire others to stick to those essential jobs that sometimes seem no more than the merest details to the noble Ram. You see, painful as this may seem, you really need the team as much as the team needs you!    Aries Rules the Head  Aries rules the head, brain and eyes, so people with Aries active in their charts are subject to head injury, headaches, general problems with organs in the head and fevers (although the nose is ruled by Scorpio). You are all extremists and for this reason can fall prey to stress-related ailments and mental problems. However, although you can be highly-strung, your great fund of energy enables you to survive where other less exuberant folks might succumb.    Your colours are red and white. Aries rules metallic iron and your birthstone is the brilliant diamond, symbolising clear strength, purified under pressure. Nature creates the precious diamond out of crumbly, coal-black carbon, by applying intense heat and pressure for a very long time. Flowers for Aries include the red poppy, geraniums, honeysuckle and hollyhocks.

kILkOc6saa	ultimate-guitar.com    It'll be your guitar best friend xD|`|0b3fa313a09fd3b8730664822eb4455baa	www.ultimate-guitar.com    (Great tab site! It's definitely my best friend haha) It has all what you need.|`|oxpwLKjCaa	911Tabs.com|`|OIWMaBUdaa	"Little boxes with dots" I am assuming you mean guitar chord symbols?  You don't often come across websites with these symbols.  There is Ultimate Guitar but it relies on text rather than symbols.    I have just compile a crash course on TAB (Tablature) for you:    TAB is extremely easy to follow and very quick to pick up.    Imagine you are looking at your guitars fretboard.  The 6 lines represent the strings on your guitar on the fretboard.  The top line represents your 6th or top E string, next line down is the fifth string or B string etc.  So if there is a number 3 on the top line, it means play fret 3 on that corresponding string:    E----3---- = 6th string 3rd fret  B----0---- = 5th string open (no fret)  G----0---- = 4th string open (no fret)  D----0---- = 3rd string open (no fret)  A----2---- = 2nd string 2nd fret  E----3---- = 1st string 3rd fret  Strum    Illustrated above is the open chord of G in TAB.  See how each line represents a string?    Open A  E----0---- = 6th string open  B----2---- = 5th string 2nd fret  G----2---- = 4th string 2nd fret  D----2---- = 3rd string 2nd fret  A----0---- = 2nd string open  E----0---- = 1st string open    E----1---- = 6th string 1st fret  B----1---- = 5th string 1st fret  G----2---- = 4th string 2nd fret  D----3---- = 3rd string 3rd fret  A----3---- = 2nd string 3rd fret  E----1---- = 1st string 1st fret    This is the F barre chord.  Lay your first finger across all six strings at the 1st fret to barre it (your finger becomes a makeshift capo of sorts) and then use 2nd finger on fret 2 on the 4th string, 3rd finger on fret 3 on the 3rd string and 4th finger on fret 3 on the 2nd string.  Just imagine you are looking at you guitars fretboard.     Each line represents the strings and each number represents the fret.    Hope this is a little help.

AA10053661	I was in college. I had an advantage over many of my friends in school because my parents lived in the same city, but had insisted that I have the "full college experience." Therefore, I was living in the dorm but with the advantage of going home every so often to do laundry and get a little pampering from my parents before coming back to the realities of school.     This was my freshman year and I had been placed with a roommate. As we all know, that can be a good or bad thing. In this case, I was very lucky. Jenny  was an amazing roommate. It was one of those friendships where you immediately connect with the person. She came in the room with her parents and we just sat in the middle of the floor and started mapping out how to fix the room. We always seemed to agree; we never argued about a thing. We liked the same things, the same places, lol even the same boys. We seriously became inseparable. The one disadvantage was that Jenny was from Ohio. From time to time, she'd get a little homesick so I'd take her home with me. Oh sure, we'd get a great meal, lots of pampering......but I know it wasn't the same for her as it was for me having my own parents there to oosh and gush over me.     One weekend, she just decided that she had to drive home. I was really really disappointed, but knew it was something she needed to do. So I made plans that night to go out with some other friends. We stayed out a bit late......maybe drank one too many beers and then staggered back to the dorm. When I finally had stumbled back up to my room, there was a note taped to the door. It was from Jenny:    Hey Girl!    Of all things, my car had a dead battery AND a flat tire. Ok, if I didn't know better, I'd swear you had sabotaged it just to keep me here. (J/K) You know I'm teasing you. But it was a ***** trying to find someone on a Friday afternoon that could come jump the battery and fix the tire. The tire ended up having a gash in it. No idea how that happened, but I can't get a new one until tomorrow, so I'm afraid I'm stuck here again this weekend. I waited up for you, but just got tired and went on to bed .  Just wanted you to know I was here so you wouldn't be startled when you came in and found me in bed. Sleep well and I'll wake you when I head to breakfast in the morning.     See ya in the A.M.,    Jenny         Man, I couldn't believe she had been here all night while I had been out partying without her. Of course this was the age before cell phones, so there was no way for her to let me know. I was bummed for her, but secretly happy for me that she was here the rest of the weekend. I unlocked the door and quietly snuck in, careful not to wake her. I fumbled my way across the room not wanting to turn on the light and risk her coming to. **BAM** I stubbed my toe on the side of the bed. I swear I wanted to scream, but instead just bit my tongue and rocked back and forth until the pain went away. I hear a shift in her bed and just KNEW I had woken her. I froze for a moment.....the shifting stopped. I quickly undressed, tossed on a t-shirt and crawled into bed. I guess I passed out in seconds. I can't remember my head even hitting the pillow.         The next day, I woke up with my stomach just rumbling.....my head just pounding from the night before. All I saw was the sunlight coming through the window. I drug my hungover body out of bed and shuffled over to the sink. I looked up into the mirror just to assess the damage from my drinking spree from the night before. But I never got that far.... I looked in the mirror and could see the reflection of the most terrifying sight I hope I'll ever have to see in my life.  ...    I slowly turned around and there was Jenny. ... lying in bed... eyes staring blankly forward .... with her throat slashed by a knife.  I got so nauseated that I turned around and lost it right there at the sink..... I could hardly breathe. My knees were weak......my heart was just pounding. I wanted to just sink into a hole and tell myself that I was still asleep and still dreaming. NONE of this could seriously have happened. I couldn't turn around again.......I couldn't bare to see whether what I saw was real or just a dream. I squeezed my eyes tight. Refusing to open them.... yet willing myself to find out if what I saw was real.     I forced my eyes open as I stared at the mirror one more time. This time......I not only saw the hideous reflection of Jenny's mutilated body, I saw a note written  on the mirror in Jenny's own blood. I fell to the floor as I read the words.......    "Aren't you glad you didn't turn on the light."|`|2liwk8yKaa	Sounds a bit like Chukky.|`|y4VWVD94aa	lol that isn't scary. but maybe to a 4 year old.|`|8e997361319fa8c6185bffb4648c20abaa	Not reading not reading not reading....

The person said "I'm coming up."  She though nothing of it and continued on with her day.  A while later she got another phone call from the same voice "I am the viper and I am coming up."  This time she was really scared and called the cops.  In a couple minutes there was a knock at her door she opened it and it was a man who said "I am the viper, I vish to vash and vipe your vindows." lol! like it?|`|BpeGhqnGaa	i think it should end like this    "she called 911 and the phone line was dead. she looked back over for the doll and her parents, and noticed they were missing.  she looked out the window, and saw her parents lying there dead.  to her right, the doll was standing there with a knife. emily screamed and ran away, and the doll was quickly chasing after her, wanting her blood."      the end|`|0gnPwv5Kaa	This story is fit to be told @ a sleepover for 5 year olds.  The person writing it obviously wrote it for others in their own age bracket.  When I read it, I knew it was a story meant 2 appear on Nickalodeon (???) and not for adults:)|`|aV3bFchtaa	No
7B2s7maWaa	The first one was great.      I know the second one, I haven't listened to it in a while actually.    Thanks for sharing and posting both. :]      bq:Eh, not really.

The guy's voice is good, but he does that thing of breathing out the last part of a word that's just so unnecessary.  BA: Mostly I love it, but if it's forced on me, awkward.|`|ssoZ33XIaa	I love that Mayday Parade song, it's probably my favorite by them.  Great lyrics.  I've never heard the other song before, but I liked it, so thanks for posting it.    BA: yes, yes I do.|`|yaDPjzcPaa	That's my FAVORITE song by Mayday, other then "One Man Drinking Games"... They are both about one of the band members girlfriends who had died/was dying (at the time they were writing the songs) and they both make me tear up :)  Ahh, amazing :)    The other one I heard for the first time right now, and I think it is decent as well.|`|WU4MHq3aaa	BQ:I should get a trophy for hugging people... except for the person who I love hugging most has a boyfriend.... damn him!... but i digress|`|AA10569146	I thought this was gonna be another poem dedicated to me =P    Anyway my youtubes blocked >:(      Edit- WOW 2 thumbs down....it was the "back off b*tches" remark....wasnt it =(|`|kILkOc6saa	The first one was catchy.

EPIC song, and great vocals. I liked both songs, but the Mayday Parade one was a little too sad for me!    BA: I love to hug people!

BQ: Sure I like hugging people. *come here so I can give you a bone crushing bear hug =)|`|Gslf19Uvaa	the first one was pretty good...i've never listened to them before :) it was weird, like a slow, but intense slow song :)    i love that song! i just ? mayday parade!!  he's got SICK vocals. honestly amazing.    BA: i love to hug people :)|`|zpTIvQQaaa	Can't listen to anything right now, but I've heard the Mayday song, and it's definitely my favorite from them.

aKBqMLuhaa	There is always Live/dead, and Europe 72', and 1,2,&3 From the Vault. (One From the Vault is my fav of those)<br>  Dick's Picks are all fine and dandy, and well remastered. For some reason 14 is my favorite.<br>  Try checking out Dead.net for albums and links.<br>  <br>  There is also a good Garcia/Kahn bootleg out there from the Oregon State Prison (5/5/82), not sure if its out by release or just bootleg though.<br>  <br>  It really depends on what era you like best, but I think the Vault series are a good jumping off point as each is from a different era.|`|ONWCXzUMaa	Live/Dead 1969. I'm not sure where you can buy it. This was their first extended concert recording. Spreed over two albums. It unleashed several key entries into their repertoire, including the side-long epic and Deadhead anthem "Dark Star" as well as wailing and otherwise electrified acidic covers of the Rev. Gary Davis blues standard "Death Don't Have  No Mercy", and the R & B Turn On Your Lovelight. It has become an aural snapshot of this zenith in the Grateful Dead's 30-year evolution and as such is highly recommended for all manner of enthusiasts<br>  <br>  take care<br>  dave|`|DnWsMhwLaa	<a href="http://www.archive.org/details/GratefulDead" rel="nofollow">http://www.archive.org/details/GratefulD...</a>|`|fB8ujUVNaa	Dick's Picks number six<br>  Keep your day job is sweet!~|`|ba74136743a472fe704b452f6252c9a6aa	Without A Net Sold Everywhere|`|JSryPP8faa	I choose to watch The Grateful Dead,The Closing Of Winterland, 12/31/1978 dvd which I purchased at Best Buy.

EuWr4URqaa	That really varies from artist to artist. Some rappers like 2Pac are great with words, alliteration, and poetry so they wrote most of their own lyrics while someone else produced the song. Some artists like Kanye West and Eminem can write good lyrics and produce the song as well. Then there are some that can produce but the lyrics are garbage like Diddy. Most rappers nowadays do use ghostwriters though. If you are curious, read the credits next time to see who mostly writes their own stuff.|`|r6o6NF3Eaa	...Rappers rap....Producers produce music.....Your confusing the two as if they are suppose to be the same. Yes some rappers suck...just like some producers suck. Don't think that "Rhyming some words" isn't much of a task. The rapper is the main focus of a rap song....if he isn't then he failed as a rap artist.<br>  <br>  So in short, a Rap artist....RAPS....but isn't that kind of obvious?|`|XuEMf100aa	Rap Artists are like presidential candidates running for office.  They are the face, the voice, the package being presented, but it usually someone else behind the scenes that puts together the package.|`|HpjfUrPDaa	it depends who the rapper is because just like in any other genre of music you have some people that can write, produce , and all that other stuff and some don't and they just get famous off of performing other people's material|`|eDRk230Uaa	liie ryme soe word and all thoses aother things <Avrilroxzmysoxz>|`|Dwyfm0Ljaa	well if your not really mainstream i can say dat they put alot into promotion n things like dat

LOL    Sabotage in my opinion would be Sabbath's third best album behind Paranoid and the self titled Black Sabbath album.|`|PF6yKkVDaa	It's a good album as far as Sabbath goes, but definitely not their best. The 5 albums that preceded "Sabotage" were better.|`|lGzQtEH7aa	Black Sabbath's Sabotage album is ok, but their best albums in my opinion are Paranoid and Master of Reality. Some of their best songs are in those albums, such as "Iron Man","Paranoid", "War Pigs", "Sweet Leaf", "Children of the Grave"and "Into the Void".  No offense, Sabatoge is a great album, but not Sabbath's strongest one though.My favorite songs from Sabatoge are "Hole in the Sky", "Symptom of the Universe", and " Megalomania".|`|gDxMoBl9aa	It's My  1 Metal Album and My  4 Overall Album of all time.

My favorite rappers are Zack De La Rocha and Anthony Kiedis(people will disagree whether or not he's a rapper but I love his rapping) Eminem I like too.  Nothing against rap, I just don't listen to a lot of it.  That's my excuse for the maybe unoriginal answers.|`|WD9vYTTmaa	Favorite Rapper~ Azael  http://www.soundclick.com/bands/default....  www.myspace.com/azaelrap      Favorite Rap Group (which Azael is in)~ Raw Data  http://www.rawdatahiphop.com/  http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fus...      Azael is an underground rapper from my state and is also friends with my brother and my brother's ex-roommate so I've seen him perform and met him before....he's a great guy with freaking amazing skills....better than most of the sh*t that is out there....    :)|`|YwqfYVPbaa	I like Asheru. He's the guy who did the theme to Boondocks. I'm also partial to Lady Sovereign and MF Doom. The only big, mainstream rapper I've ever cared for is Eminem. Other than a few "Rap-Rock" groups like Corporate Avengers, that's about it. Oh yeah, Wu Tang Clan is pretty good...|`|GhI9wYUiaa	N.W.A.|`|8oDAhb7Waa	I have no use for rap. Any retard, drooling with Down Syndrome can press buttons on a computer to loop pre-made beats and add samples from other songs while saying "Yeah....yeah....fa sho.... yeah.... OKAAAAAAAAY.....WHAT!....." 4638745 times in the span of 3-4 minutes while scratching a record on a turntable. It's complete garbage. Look at that lame Master P, he got rich by moaning like he was either a zombie out of some B rated horror movie or constipated on the toilet.

If hip hop were to ever get a Bob Dylan, Aesop Rock has been the closest so far. (He's nowhere in his league of course, but that's how far ahead Aesop is than his contemporaries)     other favorites:  Del Tha Funkee Homosapien, MF Doom, The Roots, Murs, El-P(mainly for his production), Antipop Consortium, Blackalicious, etc..|`|O5xCjej1aa	I so agree with Zach about Lil Jon.

lpyWVR2oaa	Definitely. The Moon in the natal chart will have a strong impact on ANYONE, more so if you are a child of the moon. If your Rising Sign is also Cancer, then the Moon will become the Chart Ruler and have doubly the impact on the personality.    When the Moon is in a Fire sign like Aries, you are likely to be emotionally impulsive, reckless at times, impatient and initiative. This may clash with your essential nature of being a Cancer as they are in squared signs (Cancer and Aries). The Cancerian cautious approach to things may be thwarted by a burning desire within to get things started or finished.     Hence, the trick is to find a middle ground with this squared sign aspect, by first accepting that both your moon needs and sun wants are valid and very much a part of your individuality. Timing is crucial when it comes to the execution of actions.|`|ZII6YCk1aa	Yea, it does.   My cancer is sun, aries moon, cancer rising.

29def525b4de3e4f1e95aaabfaa25f77aa	He's only been shown a few times in which he's given Steffy longing looks. I think Marcus is on his way out because he is rarely shown anymore.

I feel so bad for marcus she turned him down then jumpped in ricks pants the mourning sure wasnt long.|`|fk9AvB25aa	They sent Marcus off to Paris when they brought Rick home. That was when Rick first tried to make a move on Steffie but she wouldn't have him then. I wish the writers would put Marcus back in the story.|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	I think they may have sent him to Paris for a shoot or something.  I noticed he is still in the introductory shots for B&B.  Hope he's not leaving permanently!|`|FwU6GL4Laa	I think hes just giving Steffy time to think things over and decide what she wants to do. Meanwhile there not giving him many scene's hopefully when she see's how crazy Rick is she will leave him and see how great Marcus is and they will get back together!

yZQG4Pnwaa	I think the topic is a question of your teacher's personal interest. Why is it "Should rap music be banned in clubs?" Why can't it be "Should country music be banned in clubs?" But to give a good angle on this from a "no" perspective, why not show the differences that each genre of music plays on nightclubs. Like, when you see on the movies, most fights are started where? In a country and western bar. It's alot of angles that you can use if someone agrees with this question and wants to use violence as a reason.|`|lDC0PNFTaa	this is on a censorship note, so i'd say censoring a song would not help better our community. you can censor and bleep out words all you want, but you can't take away the truth. that's the reason why artists like dead prez and immortal technique aren't played on the radio.|`|1oGBByMIaa	HELL NO|`|ioNTTqKfaa	Like others have said...stupid topic. Hip hop is 90% of the music playing at clubs. Another reason its a stupid topic is that how can you ban an entire genre of music? I can understand a discussion about banning offensive music at clubs, but hip hop does not equal offensive music. Its actually offensive to me that your teacher would categorize an entire genre of music as "bad for you" or whatever they are trying to say about hip hop.|`|gPuASwcWaa	No what a stupid idea evreyone loves rap and that will not be fair to others just because you don't like it.You are a selfish human bean with no consederation of other peoples opinion you should be ashamed of yourself.|`|3oUSroiZaa	I got a similar assignment thing is I'm not doing it.|`|f2xkcU94aa	I think the obvious answer is "No". Rap music is one of, if not the biggest, form of music in the country right now. It wouldn't make sense to ban the most popular form of music at a venue where most people go to DANCE (and meet people). Like someone else said, you could ask 'Why rap music and not electronica, rock, etc...'    Sorry if I wasn't much help, it's just such a ridiculous paper to assign in the first place.|`|4hiMgHMCaa	no it shouldn't. that's the main music that's played at the clubs. your teacher is an old tramp who doesn't like rap personally.|`|42a3494c4c91e3621ec36d45d2b2ef4faa	u need to think of a new topic. thats stupid    thats like saying u should ban techno music at raves    edit: u need to tell your teacher that the topic is stupid and would defeat the whole purpose of going to the club, and it would be racist to ban a certain type of music from a club|`|VgE6HSdtaa	Wtf? Lol that would be contradicting the meaning of going to clubs. Don't you think
E6YshjXzaa	There are either of the possibility. Some Most of the actress will finish their graduation so that if they get failed in the film field they can search the jobs based on their education. But there are some rare case where the actor/actress has become so famous and has studied just 4th or 5th standard.|`|0IB1An2xaa	No, they still have to go to school. Maybe a private school or have a private teacher to teach them!!!|`|TDGhHIvNaa	It is a requirement of most states and Canada-if you have juvenile actors on the set a certain amount of time must be spent in or doing school work.  if there are a lot of kids in the show's cast then they set up a room to be used as school.  Several child actors have gone on to university.|`|TJK0rW5Gaa	no they get homeschooled like if they are on a show then some one goes and teaches the cast if they are on a movie same thing its just like being homeschooled at on but on a trailor|`|ftvPJfEXaa	Well some goes off and on but theyll be gone for a year|`|TEW2oCF2aa	Who wants education in film world. They are bent upon earning by any method by exposing, cajoling, compromising, going for politics, abusing, acting in real life, join with  smugglers, mafias  etc and try earning and finally end up making lots of money both legally and illegally. Indian are fools and worship the film personals as semi gods and treat them like some somebody extradinary even if he or she is a very small artist.    That is all these people want and finally end in politics and become real Dhadhas.|`|z17WtSvxaa	no they go to school everyday just like us.  they are homeschooled. except if they have to  go to school while filming a movie or something  they go to school about 5 -6 times lol. its like on and   off school i guess.|`|e2c41707eaac6501e5cbfc25665d75b6aa	Yes ofcourse they do. Because it is the education thats going to feed them after they get old and have no more move offered to them to act in. In case you are planning to become an actor, take up education in interior designing as you will have a lot of contacts in the film industry to do their house decor in the later states of life.|`|bvUqWLJOaa	they get homeschooled soo they will get to have a career even if they quit showbiz.  education is manditory no matter WHO they are|`|e8C54nuSaa	no|`|KeCLtvpGaa	no .         they will be tacking the permission from the school for to the shooting purpose two are three month they will be on leave

Cash's version gives me goose bumps.|`|cWxwHMQWaa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-WZG-y2e...    Some times in the good way, some times in the sad way.

FC2Kdo29aa	babe, its krakatoa.<br>  <br>  and it might, you never know.|`|pMFLqU0Yaa	You mean Anak Krakatau? I missed the show last night, but it wouldn't surprise me if it did erupt. The question for me is the severity of the eruption. I don't think we'll see a catastrophic eruption in our lifetimes as it's fairly active from what I've heard and I think that, much like fault lines and earthquakes, as long as *some* pressure is being released you're not as likely to have a catastrophic eruption, but rather more of a "burp".<br>  <br>  But what do I know? I'm a chef, not a geologist. I'm just guessing/using what I consider to be common sense.|`|e458b49846d0cdbd9493a27ec2896b94aa	Yes very soon too.

Hmm idk.................|`|sixm6Vlraa	what is that?|`|dAKgZr7Xaa	Krakatau/Crackertoa~~tomato/tomatoe.<br>  <br>  Unlikely, it would have VERY long cycles, hundreds, maybe thousands of years.  You are more likely to see Naples buried, partially at least, like Pompeii.<br>  <br>  There would be weakness there, a plate boundary or other fault.  But it would also be strong enough to resist tremendous pressure, building up enormous forces which would allow it to finally blow most of the island away, leaving the vast caldera, or void that may be 'seen' today.|`|PN7XMglOaa	No , I don't , the last time Crackatoa erupted was in 1943 . They made a movie about it , " Crackatoa , East of Java " .|`|h4TxVSp3aa	Definatly a chance|`|w8hgR6Bfaa	CRACKER toa? <br>  <br>  yes it will erupt tomorrow & It will spew molten white people.<br>  <br>  Good question. you get a cookie|`|z5O056Beaa	Yes it might|`|ilbMPWmzaa	maybe, stranger things have happened|`|LS2mF8u3aa	Yes, I love Crack.|`|92HCc1vxaa	Woa.

kGCd8ioRaa	a little|`|32bf6cc091942a6c4cc7b3f575927ebcaa	I think people should mind their own business.  He isn't harming anyone by smoking pot.    I also think that if his sponsors choose to take away his endorsements there better be some kind of morals clause in the contract or something like that or he should sue.|`|8e373a7bc6b3c784f2bae9cc02a6cf20aa	He'll be punished financially when he loses all his endorsements.|`|001fdff241c5ac2eea5ff3e20360461faa	NO WAY!  omg did he? THATS SO STUPID!!!!! OMG!  everyone makes mistakes give him a chance! he apologized? please tell me they didn't! he must've worked so hard for them :(|`|MZWdvdEwaa	I'm just suprised.  Pot heads are all stupid, None of them are winners.|`|l5hCRJgmaa	nahh he really had to work to get those but yeah, he should have been smarter about it.|`|NPwOxS3eaa	No he shouldn't.  I can imagine he worked very very hard to earn those medals and the Olympics should have nothing to do with his personal life at this point. But most likely the next time the Olympics come around hes going to get drug tested like every day.|`|fLaFElk8aa	What photo?|`|MyV9qm99aa	No, but do doctors or special trainers check if he had done drugs during the Olympics. Was this incident after. If it was after, no but doing drugs period is a stupid choice.     GOD BLESS  99.5 KKLA|`|zi06yiu1aa	honestly, i don't think its that big of a deal.|`|Wbxekzy8aa	no, no, no, no, no, no, no, and no!  He smoked a bit of weed, haven't most of us?|`|BQIyhMp6aa	i am not being biased at all, i could honestly care less, but he was only photographed smoking pot, he wasn't caught by law enforcements. he shouldn't have to serve community service either. he didn't get in trouble and it's definitely too late to charge him and take actions for that now. people do illegal things every day, some are just lucky. i don't agree that he should have any sort of punishment and his medals should definitely not get taken away, that's rediculous.|`|AI4My948aa	He should be spanked.  On TV.|`|ndH6W5Ncaa	No, why should he get stripped of his medals?   It's not like he's doing steroids.  Weed doesn't help him perform better in any way.|`|ImQmxqWHaa	What did he do?|`|T1sQd6A8aa	Why would smoking marijuana be an issue for taking away medals?  It's not like he was high when he was competing. And if he was... well that's a slap in the face to people who think drugs make you lazy.    I rarely smoke weed (once every 3 months... if that) and I'm happy to find out that Phelps smokes weed. It proves that weed doesn't make a person lazy, it proves that you're only lazy when you're under the infuence of it.    And to all these people that are saying, "OMG I can't believe he would do that!" or "Cannibis is bad for you and illegal!"    Well, it's not you doing the drugs, so mind your own business. And if you've ever littered, j-walked, driven without a seatbelt, etc, etc. that's also illegal. And marijuana is safer than alcohol... If you find drinking morally ok, and not smoking.. you're probably retarded.    So, get off Phelps nuts. He should be allowed to do whatever he wants without you pathetic people who down something you have never experienced or attempted to understand.|`|JhrdIVBgaa	Marijuana is awesome... Micheal Phelps won a sh*tload of medals for our country. If he wants to get baked, then let the man get baked.|`|56bNLJykaa	take away his medals? thats the craziest thing i've ever heard. and whoever does say that I will hope when they make one mistake all their life's accomplishments will be taken away. In terms of trouble with the law.. He cant. So, whats the point of arguing? The only thing that I could see happening is loosing one or two sponsors, which is enough (loosing thousands of dollars for smoking marijuana- even at that the crime does not fit the punishment). People need to get real, who cares what he does, I have seen pictures like that all the time whether it be a college student or celebrity.|`|kyoVTAMkaa	he was my role model because i am on the swim team at my high school but not no more i HATE drugs so much!!!!!!!!!|`|uNt9UGYcaa	He shud smoke more pot on live tv|`|X2iqUiM1aa	Just to tell everyone, michael phelps isn't a pot head. He's an Olympic swimmer. His photo got leaked by his mad ex girlfriend. I think some of you people sound ignorant. He's 23 yeahrs old. Get off his case. He's still the best swimmer.|`|F8GUqsqiaa	Yes! He knows he's in the public eye and he always needs to be setting a good example. There is no excuse for what he did, saing "I'm young and it was a mistake" does not work. There are plently of young guys who don't smoke marijuana. Lets rip those medals off his marijuana smoking neck!!|`|4IwAm2x2aa	not really|`|SFDCB2Xsaa	He will never get his medals taken away.|`|tA5NXIZdaa	No. He's not the only person to smoke a bong  Im sure all those rapper dudes are smoking weed and sniffing cocaine but no one ever cares that THEY do it.|`|Kbgc6x5raa	we can't decide weather or not he deserves to be punishes.|`|st5reHVjaa	he shouldnt have his medals taken.  he should have community service or overnight in jail for a few weeks.  but should he be excused because he's an olympic winner? no|`|AA10026476	Cuz of the economy|`|6ccd4882dc74fe3bac069fc84fb4af63aa	Punished, yes... by confiscation of medals, no.|`|k0Ewe7mCaa	He'll never get the medals taken away. Ease off him, there are millions of other people in the world that smoke weed.|`|44fbG4IUaa	they don't need to take away all his medals, but he does need to be punished. i mean his excuse was that "he's 27".|`|mggll8dRaa	The Medals are safe, but He is a Dope......Obviously....!!|`|RfPDOPEwaa	yeah he was stupid for doing that  but noo i don't think they should punish him like that, everyone makes mistakes  and im sure he received enough punishment by letting a lot of people down who saw him as a role model, he probably feels like crap.

PJqIvsjyaa	this picture is not even bad!! i've taken pictures making stupid faces like this one and i am definitely not racist!!!    look at it this way...whenever she makes her pout, is she discriminating against people with big lips (hello angelina jolie!)??    whenever she makes the peace sign, is she mocking it and sticking her fingers up in a sarcastic, ironic way?    whenever ANYONE, YOU AND I AND EVERYONE ELSE makes a funny face, are we making fun of someone who actually looks like that??    NO!!    plus, shes right next to an Asian guy. if she was being racist to me and i was standing next to her i'd punch her in the face and make sure all of her fans know about it.    just because its miley, everyones making a huge deal out of it.|`|kJ7mcPLbaa	She's a classless, untalented, UGLY, inbred, piece of trailer trash.

She is a pig-faced, fake teeth, hillbilly whore.    Also, where are her parents when all of this is happening? She is sitting on her 21-year-old boyfriend's lap?! All of the adults around these girls are using them for their fame, money, and their own personal agendas.     She needs help. And everyone, especially parents, need to boycott Disney!

At the end of the day pride and self respect are the what make us who we are (and the levels of those two components are what describes our being).|`|KvVTmlLWaa	Haha, I don't get it either. I mean, we like what we like, and the whole reason that Twilight became this worldwide phenomenon is because of us. We're not stupid, and we are not fat. It's extremely childish to go around calling people fat and ugly and stupid just because we like a book and it's film adaption. I'm not stupid, Alot of my teachers have said that I am extremely bright and top of my class, so stick that back up where it came from. Also, I may not be a model, but I don't think I'm ugly either. I really don't understand this "slagging off" at all. x|`|NkuK4DSHaa	Ignore them all. I love Twilight, and I wouldn't classify myself as ugly, and definitely not stupid [not to brag, but I got 11 A*s at GCSE].<br>  People just think "Twilight = vampires. Therfeore fans of it are geeky comic book obsessed people"<br>  They blatently haven't read the books. So does it matter what they think?|`|x9ooysDhaa	Nobody I no thinks that, and all of my friends (aka most of the people in my school) LOVE twilight, 95% of us are addicted, and only a few are uglyish, and not even properly ugly, so whoever said that is obviously a complete and utter idiot, who knows NOTHING about FANTASTICLY FANTASTIC books!<br>  <br>  <br>  I am officially irritated with certain people...|`|WOMzaicUaa	Because People Think That Twilight Girls Just Wish They Where Bella(Edward Boyfriend) And Are Ugly because they Cant Get A Boy Friend But That Is Not True.<br>  Ive Got Twilight And New Moon Books. Getting Others :)<br>  And Like Ive Watched The Film 7times does that make me ugly or stupid ?<br>  <br>  What ever dont listen to them.|`|PD3qATQtaa	Someones opinions don't make facts, the truth is the vast majority of us couldn't care.|`|oJTxk2cDaa	Again , I no nothing about this subject.

It's a great story.  But I do see where people are coming from... It's not the best literature out there... Sometimes I think that she wrote the books with a 5th graders reading level in mind.|`|b146bf3f7e2e162a7266cd68a0222d22aa	Most people don't think Twilight fans are ugly as you clearly aren't, just stupid!|`|p5kzRDIpaa	ive never heard anyone say that about twilight fans.

Then the preview for next week was about:     Basically, Ricky tells Jack that he is in interested in Amy, and Amy says "I love him" but we don't know to who. Amy and Ricky hug, and I guess Ben feels sort of jealous (again.) His father sort of infers that this was "BOUND" to happen and Ben sort of walks away. Adrian and Grace get in a fight over Ricky, Adrian uses comments like, "He DOESN'T even love you!"    Have fun! =]|`|b1WHfkCtaa	It was episode 16

But I like All Eyez On Me.|`|8XT1Tvcvaa	I think most people who are familiar with 2pac's music would agree MATW is the better album. That's really his only undeniable classic.    All Eyez on Me had a lot of filler and bullsh*t songs, it's been criminally overrated.|`|3drMJB1maa	I prefer All Eyez On Me but Me Against The World is better.

6113592ee4cd8092af2e3a43a226cb9daa	The island obviously has healing properties, healing Locke of his paralysis as he was special.  Perhaps Richard, who is the one the Island has appointed to guide and select the leaders of the hostiles, is being healed in the sense that his cells are not decaying, and thus his body does not age.|`|v0GwTTsVaa	Good question.........maybe he learns to time travel........or the island keeps him young for some reason.........looking forward to finding out!!!|`|bibIAhN9aa	There's a picture of him in an attic somewhere where is face is wracked by old age the lines of a man who has done terrible, terrible things....|`|aEb8Q19Kaa	I think maybe later on he finds out how to time travel but when you see him when locke is young and stuff thats before he figured it out.|`|2716717868fe21f32f85869cd02f81d8aa	I get the feeling that Richard is the keeper of the Island and that is why he hasn't aged. But this series is so good|`|GBKaftrJaa	Isn't that the best mystery of the show?  I just figured he knew how to time travel at first since the island does that.  But after seeing the last episode I'm thinking there's another explanation, especially since Julia said he's always been on the island.|`|LBovv7Sxaa	he's probably immortal.  & has a strong connection with the island.  i think richard is at least 1,000 years old.    i think once you leave the island is when you start to age.  think of the island like never never land in peter pan.|`|lynmeenmaa	yes but didnt charles leave the island? has richard been there since he got there?u dont age ON the island only after u leave. i think ?

PDXNZp3paa	in japan there is folklore stating that if you think dirty thoughts your nose will bleed, similar to the American if you lie your nose will grow|`|FqjgCT1Qaa	It just shows they're attracted.|`|gZi3SmFAaa	The blood vessels in your nose are thinner and closer to the surface therefore more fragile than most. When you become emotionally agitated your blood pressure increases and the blood vessels burst from the pressure. At least that is the medical answer.   So when I guess when they see those girls they get "emotionally agitated."|`|AA11107214	That's the equivalent of their pants suddenly getting tighter.|`|O2hmjOPyaa	Though I'm not entirely certain, I'm fairly sure it has to do with "rising blood pressure." When a male anime character sees an attractive female, their blood pressure begins to rise (as a result of desire, attraction, fantasy, what-have-you) and results in a nose bleed.    Basically, it is a physical manifestation of their desire for that character. Another typical reaction you might see is when the character's entire face flushes read and smoke begins to pour from their ears or their head simply "explodes."|`|W1lh6A8saa	It's part of an old  japanese folk-lore tell that sexual excitement leads to change in blood pressure, which results in nosebleeds.   :D|`|kF5WGHxvaa	they cant show them getting a woody

asX2hxFXaa	No, but they're fun and often coincedental.  Usually, they are so general that the odds of being correct or relevant are high.  It's like saying, "You will breathe air today."    Last week one day, mine said "Someone in a position of power will try to intimidate you.  Don't let them.  Make your case and stand your ground."    So, that day I got a job offer and I turned them down and gave my reasons why I deserved more pay, and they came back with a better offer.

Try to find any area where astrology clearly succeeds to do better than random chance. Or better that simpler and more likely alternatives.     Fact is that statistics do not support astrology. Astrologers and scientists can not produce any evidence. For being so great and powerful, it hides it's proof very well. Every thing is anecdotal at best.    There is a million dollars waiting for the first person that can provide proof for astrology. This has been offered for over ten years.    For personal reasons, it is a bigoted concept that is akin to racism and sexism. It stereotypes and pigeonholes based on date of birth. Which nobody has control over. Free will make belief in astrology pointless.|`|KkOzs2Czaa	Not much... but the girl i love does so i'm getting into it to c what it's like.|`|CRsSw0ssaa	I believe in showering daily.|`|dDDAbqqhaa	no because fate isnt sealed by some stupid article in the newspaper|`|ydCoPRkRaa	no because everybody is different. but it is entertaining|`|VBeFzAV1aa	blue|`|qnBVKBJIaa	Astrology, because it describes me pretty well.|`|7VYfti4daa	i like horoscopes it gives you a different way to look at things|`|5BOhn6Ubaa	no cause if u new ur destiny it would change.

24ff965b698b01fab680ef159e41f361aa	see the movie honey..|`|yqe0I5zpaa	Slumdog Millionaire was a unique experience, showing the depths of India, it also was well-made, great sound, great acting (for an unknown cast) and great direction from the legendary Danny Boyle, the film also showed America, a different approach to making movies and great Indian style music. The Dark Knight was too typical for Americans.|`|Y4RS35M7aa	"Slumdog..." had a plot and interesting characters telling a nice story. <br>  <br>   BM:TDK had explosions, CGI, car chases, um...did I mention explosions?|`|zBkaqIWcaa	Best Picture?<br>  <br>  The Dark Knight was another victim of stereotypes in the Academy that block nominations (thus opportunitiy to win the Academy Award) to mivies about superheroes.  Until these stereotypes are eliminated the only options for superheroes movies are for Oscars for technical areas like special effects or music soundtrack.|`|bLnvyyP8aa	it doesn't, <br>  'the dark knight' is a better movie<br>  slumdog millionaire shows our country india in a poor light, with its depiction of slums <br>  i'm not saying they have shown it wrong, but the movie's main selling point is its so-called 'poverty porn' or showing the west a picture of india as they would like it<br>  there are many great and beautiful things about india that they could have shown, but they had to go and make a movie about our slums|`|1uRUaSblaa	Let you know after I watch 'Slumdog Millionaire' next time....|`|X9H77A9xaa	i havent seen dark night, but i love slumdog millionaire|`|2ORprA0Haa	It's not a question of time. Dark Knight is an action adventure based on a comic book and slumdog millionaire is a rags to riches tale with a indepth portrayal of human emotion. No one can say one is better, that is a matter of opinion but more people can relate to slumdog millionairre because of it's whole structure. Batman can be redone to the death, the characters will always be the same stereotypes, the storylines predictable. I think your age has something to do with it, I get the feeling your young but with more life experience you will relate to things differently.|`|f456a981d29b822c5b34d993104fa366aa	Well you see, Slumdog Millionaire is from another country. This movie originated in India. So Americans really think it is cool and like it. <br>  <br>  But Dark Knight is sort of getting old now, so I could see why. People like to see the newest movies, not relive one over and over forever.<br>  <br>  But eventually something else will beat Sludog Millionaire, and we can get all mad over that.|`|0fe94fd7d5db6bc0416b695f26217eeaaa	I don't know.. I just don't know... I guess I'll have to watch Slumdog Millionaire and find out.|`|KEsf9ziJaa	see dude cartoons child fictions cant be optimistic only kids like those not grownups

Promote it everywhere in School, im pretty sure those kids will tell thier moms and theres hundreds of students in schools and im pretty sure it'll be a good turn out.

All in all, they make the show.  I could do without Gloria, if she is still on a mission to destroy everything she touches, but if she changes somewhat, I can see her hanging in there.<br>  I am really tired of these women falling for these OBVIOUSLY bad men, though, what's up with that!

lEmKvS50aa	Actually his voice is the problem.  I've heard many people say it sounds like he's singing through his nose or that he has a cold or something.  He's too old to still have that voice.  It may have worked when he was 15 singing "braid my hair" but you're a grown man with a teenage voice and that's not sexy.  Women are not turned on about that.  His voice even limits him to the language record execs allow him to use because it doesn't match the tone.  Think about it.|`|dOurKVdiaa	I dont know, but i know he dissed NEYo for writing that one song for him, that was his one hit that he has had in awhile, but then i dont know if it was the back lash from that or what, but he feel off, i seen like a reality show with his moms on that stuff, and i will here songs from him every now and again, but thats it<br>  <br>  seen him on Dancing with the Starz too|`|gL0ppoh9aa	Which mario? <br>  Mario Winans <br>  He sings: I don't wanna know, never really was...<br>  <br>  or <br>  <br>  Mario Barrett?<br>  He sings: how could you, just a friend, crying out for me, braid my hair|`|yZQG4Pnwaa	He sounds the same as all of those other dudes out there.

They're awful!<br>  <br>  "Million Dollar Baby" was SO much better than Clint's last Best Picture (Unforgiven).  What a great story and a great film!<br>  <br>  "Crash" Never saw it, but it's on my Netflix list.<br>  <br>  "The Departed" was a barely tolerable gangster film.  I could barely finish it, and why does everyone get shot in the head?  Lots of people get shot...in the body!  That's where 90% of people get shot!<br>  <br>  "No Country For Old Men" I liked a lot, but more so once I had read the book.

a231cd46589d3ea6efabcc68cdd6e69baa	It was actually kind of ambiguous about how Peter's new ability works.  If you noticed, he touched Mohinder and got his strength and started hitting the guards and taking them out easily.  Then he touched Tracy and got her freezing power, but when he hit the guards they fought back easily.  It's possible that he can only have one power at a time - touching Mohinder meant gaining strength but losing flying.  Touching Tracy meant getting cryokinesis and losing strength etc.    And even if he could fly, he'd still have to get sucked out of the plane and possibly sucked into the engine or badly injured by debris before he could fly on his own.  He couldn't just levitate within the plane and take off because of all the turbulence.  And while Mohinder may be strong, he's nowhere near Superman's class.  Even if Peter had strength and flying, he wouldn't be able to stop or land the plane.  He could maybe carry two or three people, but not an entire huge airplane.|`|fd3969820c20a4244842f433a5e6eee6aa	Well, Pete has forgotten about his own powers before. Remember when he and Adam were struggling and struggling to open the door to get to the virus. Pete forgot that he had DL's power and could just walk through the door. Pete is really stupid. So it's not really a plot hole.     The biggest plot hole for me is Where is Molly? Where are Nathan's kids?     I'm obsessed. These kids are all I think about. Why don't the parents care that they are missing?|`|kA0uNL5iaa	I love Heroes! Ok. I think Peter DOES have his abilities, but isnt sure if they will work or not. Do you remember when he had lost his powers for a long time because of his dad? Even after he injected himself it could be a while for him to be able to fully control his powers or not. I am still also a little confused about Sylar though. I mean, I know he is bad, but how come when he keeps finding who is thought to be his parents, its turns out another way? and i know Sylar's original powers are to understand how things work, but how can he cut the tops of peoples heads?? Anyway, how come Peter woke up so quickly after Claire helped Hiro?? I mean couldnt Hiro pause so the plane wont crash yet? And where where they planning to take all the people with abilities from the plane? Well I love the show and i am happy i found someone else who likes it!|`|2a93295e665a94d49d03426e34243078aa	stefgirl: Hiro lost his power -- so he can't freeze time or teleport through time or space anymore.    Peter: Because Peter had his powers removed by his dad, he has to learn them all over again.  His original power was to learn other people's powers, similar to Silar, but without having to hurt them (as Silar does).  Thus, he can't fly until he re-learns that power from his brother.  He learns a power either when another person uses that power in his presence, or he touches them and absorbs that power directly.  Even then, he may not know what power he has absorbed or how to use it -- as was the case when he absorbed the power to freeze things with his hands.  He didn't know she could do it and, therefore, he didn't know he could do it until he did it by accident.    God bless.

IRH71dwIaa	No pic of him in costume but according to imdb.com Joseph Gordon-Levitt is playing Cobra Commander
qJ9o3iQnaa	Yeah I also liked him in Once Upon on a Time in Mexico.  I think it was because he wasn't in leading roles in big name films. It kind of makes his story more dramatic.  And we all know Hollywood has a flair for the dramatics. :-)|`|tiGpryHiaa	he was out of the main stream hollywood.  You know how the Hollywood elitists are|`|W5E8GhiBaa	AND he was in Sin City, pretty nasty character I'd say. Was never nominated for anything though. He hadn't been nominated for anything for the last 15 years. That's where they are going. Earliest movie I remember him by is the little soft porn he did with Kim Bassinger called "9 1/2  Weeks".<br>  <br>  He's definately coming back though, he's always been great. Can't wait to see more films with him.

Nr4dOPWWaa	There can never ever be one right answer to this kind of riddle. The way i figured this is;    I am a murderer in prison and while I am doing some kind of work I got thirsty. The house is probably the jailer's office and he asked me to stay in the room that I entered while he was away to get me water.     But I broke the rule and entered living room of the jailer where I saw the weapons and the keys to escape. Now if the jailer doesnt shoot me I can shoot him using the weapons in the room and escape. So he has to act immediately. He can legally kill me to get the control back.    A different answer with me being a foreign spy can also be correct when I have seen the map & locations of where weapons are.|`|40HpQquSaa	gold slaves|`|gPuASwcWaa	Hus murder, porn, prisim records|`|tx24llZAaa	classified documents????  can we have a hint?|`|5HOlGpLkaa	that is a toughy he said you "have to stay in the room you walk in" well to that he would have to stay so the man would kill him and the police would see blood.

Y0w2Pk5kaa	Prior to the release of the The Golden Compass on December 7, 2007, New Line said that an adaptation of The Subtle Knife would go into production only if the first film was a success. The Golden Compass made over twice its budget worldwide, but flopped in the United States, leaving the fate of its sequel unclear. In addition, the international rights were originally sold to provide financing for the first film, thus amounting to a significant financial loss for New Line Cinema. Producer Deborah Forte, however, is adamant that she will finish the trilogy, saying, "I believe there are enough people who see what a viable and successful franchise we have." The studio that produced the first movie of the trilogy decided not to make the other two.    In IMBd, the movie is currently in production but on hold.

ajP0ewyeaa	I Heart ? - Taylor Swift   (it is called "I Heart ?")    Love all her songs!!!!!!!!    Wish I had concentrated,   They said love was complicated,   But it's something i just fell into,     And it was over-rated   But just look what I've created   I came out alive but I'm black and blue-ue     Before you ask me if I'm alright,   Think about what i,   Had to do-oo, yeah     Wake up and smell the break-up   Fix my heart, put on my make-up   Another mess i didn't plan,   And I'll bet, you thought you'd beat me,   Wish you could only see,   I've got an i heart question mark,   Written on the back of my hand.     I'd be fine if you just walked by,   But you had to talk about why,   You were wrong and i was right,     But i can't believe you made me,   Sit at home and cry like a baby,   Wait right by the phone every night,     And now you ask about you and i,   There's no you and i,   Remember what you put me through,   I had to,     Wake up and smell the break-up,   Fix my heart put on my make-up,   Another mess i didn't plan,   And I'll bet, you thought you'd beat me   I wish you'd could only see   I got an i heart question mark,   Written on the back of my hand     And when you're home alone at night,   You'll still wonder   Why you took everything i had, oh baby   I had a lot about you and i,   There's no you and i,   And i know,   Someday you will...     Wake up and smell the break-up,   Realize that we won't make-up   It didn't go the way you planed,     And you'll know you didn't beat me,   When you look down and see,   I've got an i heart question mark   Written on the back of my hand,     Written on the back of my hand   An i heart question mark, yeah   Written on the back of my hand|`|0rfnAfeIaa	type in the lyrics you know on google and it will probably pull it up for you

"Genres: adventure, drama, horror, mystery, psychological, science fiction, supernatural   Themes: cyberpunk, post-apocalyptic   Age rating: Mature (May contain bloody violence, bad language, nudity)   Plot Summary: In a future where the world has been ravaged by a nuclear apocalyse, there exists salvation in a domed city named "Romdeau", where humans and their android servants, the autoreivs, live in. Under the implementation of complete management control, it is a paradise where feelings are literally discarded, and the governing council dictates the way of life the citizens should live. But this utopian landscape is soon broken by a series of mystifying murders. Real Mayar, a female inspector from the Citizen Information Bureau, along with her autoreiv partner Iggy, are tasked to solve the murder cases. She is soon attacked by a creature drawn to her which is neither human nor android, and learns about the mysterious phenomena called "Awakening", an event which draws her further into the case...and to the world beyond the limits of Romdeau."    =^,,^=    http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclop...

jkLDzmiCaa	I think that ricky and amy will try to go out but it won't work out and she'll go out with ben afgter realizing that she needs ben. I think that she will keep the baby in the end because if she didn't then the whole show kinda goes out the window because the baby is gone. and deep inside it seems like she wants to keep the baby.
qBhmwwwmaa	You think about it.  And you cry.  And you feel sad.  After a while, it still hurts but you feel ready to move on.  When you do it will be hard.  Find a good friend to stick by.

At any rate, in some respects truth is based upon a person's belief system and therefore is relative, although it is generally viewed as a fact's lack of ability to be refuted.  Knowledge is a collection of the things you know that you have learned through a concentrated effort to gain intelligence or through first-hand experience.|`|VqAgZB0uaa	i view truth as being honest.    i view knowledge as having understanding towards things.    never thought about iot until know, but its actually kind of hard to give a short simple definition for those two words.|`|GBSnBbWiaa	Truth means being honest to all and having a good heart, the factual outcome!!  Knowledge, knowing how to deal with rough patches in life and thoroughly knowing a subject without having to reasearch it!|`|NqxDBO2Xaa	its cool|`|rzrki3OZaa	The truth is, you should be in Social Science with the intellectuals because we're in Jokes and Riddles to have fun.|`|2liwk8yKaa	Knowledge is Truth.

SsmxE0f4aa	i dont know what grade you are in, but i'm an advanced placement student in my freshman year, and they have taught us not to use 'you, we, me, my I,' etc, at ALL. It's not professional, and makes your essay sound too informal...unless you are doing a personal essay. Write something like, 'Everyone has a place they go to have a good time, but the mall is one place where people of all cliques can get together and mingle amongst eachother. That's why the mall is a great place to go to have a good time.' idk or something long the lines... hmm...good luck :)|`|2liwk8yKaa	Want to have fun, visit the Mall it has lots of exciting things to do etc etc.|`|AA10724468	Want to meet different people, see different things and eat from different cultures?|`|FtBHXQvHaa	i have fun at the mall with my friends.|`|f2f1533543e03966253e5dfdc62b7b19aa	"Do you have someplace you can go when you want to have a fun time?

Starting a story off with a question is kind of weak. Here are a few suggestions:  -"Some people might have fun at the movies or at a friends house, but I have fun at the mall."     Sometimes, It's okay to just come straight out with what you are trying to say. For example:  -"I love the mall." Then you can give a big, vage, reasons why you like the mall and explain those reasons more specifically in different subjects. Example:  -"I love the mall. I love the mall because I get to go shopping, play games and talk with my friends." Then you start a new paragraph about shopping. Put some more detail into why  you like shopping. Clothes, etc. Do this for each new reason for why you like the mall.      These are just suggestions. I would personally do it this way myself. You do not have to do these. Hope you understand and I hope this helps.|`|6fcbe940619104ed5872fbb65fb03d34aa	I enjoy spending my free time at the mall having fun!!

There are two major groups involved in the ensuring war. The first group consists of monsters known as Chiropterans who can change their appearances into that of human beings. They are actually immortals who feed on the blood of the living. The second group is an organisation known as the "Red Shield", formed to track down these monsters and exterminate them. Otonashi Saya is a high-school girl who lives a peaceful life with her family. The only problem is, she has no recollections of her life beyond that of the past year. However, her happy life will be destroyed by an event that will lead her to her destined fate.(mostly horror)    Kyou Kara Maou:    Shibuya Yuri was living a pretty normal life. That changed the day he was dunked into a toilet after an attempt to save a classmate from a gang of bullies. Instead of just getting a good soaking, he's pulled in. The next thing he knows, he's in a world that vaguely resembles medieval Europe. If that's not odd enough, he's told that he is to be the next Maoh, just because he has black hair and black eyes. The Maoh is the King of the Mazoku, who are coexisting not-so-peacefully with the humans in this world. Much to his subject's dismay, he's totally different from the rulers they're accustomed to. He's kind, considerate, a believer in justice, and not willing to use violence to solve conflicts. Not exactly someone they want running a country on the very brink of war. Now, Yuri has to deal with trying to become a good Maoh, while at the same time attempting to adapt to this land's customs and culture, all in a world where the tension between the humans and Mazoku is reaching its peak ( there is action, it is funny at certain parts, and there are like 105 episodes.. currently)      Wallflower    Kyouhei, Ranmaru, Takenaga, and Yukinojou are beautiful, handsome, young men living in a huge mansion. One day, their landlord, whom they call "Auntie", asks them a favor: to make her niece, Sunako, who's going to be living with them, into a respectable young lady. She agrees to make their living expenses free of charge if they succeed but, if they fail, she'll triple their rent. Due to their confidence in knowing how to deal with women, they agree but, once they meet Sunako, they begin to realize that their lovely living arrangements may soon be in jeopardy. (mostly comedy with 25 episodes)    Special A    When Hikari was little, she and her father liked to watch pro wrestling, and she became very good at it. She was the pride of her family until one day she was introduced to Kei, the son of her father's friend. He instantly defeated her in wrestling, and started what would become Hikari's major ambition to one day beat him. To do this she enrolled in Kei's school, an ultra elite school that costs her father a lot of money. This unusual school created classes according to grades, and the top seven students become members of the "SA". They have their own building, and can optionally attend class. Hikari is usually the only one who does so, since she desperately wants to beat Kei with test scores. The members of the "SA" have been close friends since their first year ( some romance, some comedy, has 24 episodes, and it is also a manga)      Ayashi no Ceres    Ayashi no ceres is the story of Aya Mikage and her twin brother Aki, driven apart by the forces of fate. On their sixteenth birthday, Aya and Aki are called to the family home to be given a special present. What they thought was a birthday party, however, was really a test--one which Aya failed. She was found to possess the reincarnated spirit of an ageless tennyo, one bent on the recovery of her hagoromo and the destruction of the Mikage family. Aya quickly found herself separated from her beloved brother, and hunted by her own family.  ( theres fighting, romance, little bit of comedy.. and has 24 episodes)      Hayate the Combat Butler    16-year-old Hayate is really down on his luck. Because his unemployed parents are good-for-nothings who waste what money they have on gambling, Hayate had to start working at a young age to help out his family. Although such experience has made him inhumanly fast and tough and skilled at things boys aren`t normally skilled at, it has also left him in an awkward position, as his parents have racked up such a huge gambling debt that they have sold Hayate to the yakuza for the value of his organs. In a desperate attempt to avoid that fate, Hayate decides to become a a?bad guy and kidnap someone to be held for ransom, but his efforts to do so are mistaken as a confession of love by the girl he targets. When he helps save the (as it turns out) ultra-wealthy 13-year-old Nagi from real kidnappers, she takes him in and gives him a job as her new personal butler (and love interest) until he can pay of    other good

lpyWVR2oaa	Not necessarily. It all depends on the overall chart, such as other planetary transits taking place.    This transit aspect will help you to feel more confident about yourself, your sexuality and you are likely to exude more charm and confidence, hence pulling in relationships easily. Success and ease in close personal interactions should prevail now as a general feeling of positivity overwhelms you. It is a good time for financial ventures, your social life, artistic pursuits, romance, and pleasure. You are now able to take the initiative and to achieve harmony and sexual fulfillment.     This influence brings satisfaction to the feelings. Whether you choose to manifest this into reality depends on you ultimately. There is no guarantee but you might form permanent ties or relationships that prove to be fruitful and fortunate. Your aesthetic abilities are heightened and stimulated now.
HT3LtMtaaa	you cant
5drp3dzOaa	youre not a quitter theres just other things youd rather be doing, walking on nails for instance?|`|GBbzQ68haa	Ignore them! You obviously had a reason to quit! They're not worth your time! Hope I helped!|`|EpOU7vGYaa	Ignore them, they are just being asses. People were like that to me when I quit soccer. Just ignored them and joined hockey
yUInFtXyaa	According to http://www.spoilerfix.com/gossip.php the next new episode of Gossip Girl will air on March 2, 2009.|`|MQNYKISWaa	I know, it is not airing until either March 2 or March 9. I am very angery! They are apparently busy. They havn't decided on the exact date yet ( march 9 or 2) but i hope it is before then. this is ridicules! every other series show can get one new episode on a week, why cant they?

Robert!!!!! DUH!!!!!!!

EDWARD!!!!!! I LOVE HIM!!!!!!!!!!! zac is okay though probably 50% zac|`|wU0c3i7baa	Um, Robert because he's not some self-promoting, over-primped, brainless Ken doll.    He's got some flaws, he's not muscular (which means he not some vain guy who spends all his time at the gym) and he's incredibly intelligent and witty.     I don't think someone's romantic history makes them more or less physically hot. He's had girlfriends, but he's shy when it comes to dating, which I find endearing. It's really hard for him to date now when he's in a different city every day doing non-stop promotion.     I can understand why teenie fangirls might be into Zac, but for someone like me in her early 20s, you want someone a little more mature looking who doesn't sing and dance on the Disney Channel.|`|aeODdMATaa	Robert Pattinson, there is something about British men that I like.|`|Kvajun9yaa	Can i please choose both!! =D|`|NqcnAnC1aa	Robert is WAY hotter and sexier.

Ftkr9jqYaa	I was able to view the "Best Job in the World" site, and I saw the Short-Listed Applicants, but I was unable to determine whether he was James Hill from Queensland, who now lives in London and works in commercial photography and web marketing, and is dating an English girl (possibly named Sarah?).  It was a very well-made video clip of duration 1m1s.

5z8lQIqJaa	I emailed the show and received the following response from Michael Martin - VP of Programming, "Unfortunately the bad economy has hit everywhere including us and we had to make changes. Not the best answer but its everywhere."|`|jliz83BBaa	I'd heard several weeks ago that radio stations would be effected by the economy and wondered about shows that had two hosts.   I've been tuning in more frequently and listened to 99.7 today for the first time this week heard Maria but no Baltazar.  I went to the website and see all this Maria and Chunk info but no Baltazar.  I had a feeling what I'd heard a few weeks ago had finally effected 99.7 - which is too bad as I liked Baltazar even with his goofy laugh.  Maria can just be a little to acerbic at times even though I know she cares about people.|`|nRRwJtAfaa	I read that he parted after his 2 year contract.  I couldn't find anything else.|`|ahR1zy3Laa	If they let him go, it's ridiculous.  I think he balanced Maria out perfectly.  I'm really sad since they have both been a regular part of my morning for 2 years.|`|7ai60gYJaa	They should've got rid of someone else...Micheal Martin spent all the free money on getting St.John away from kyld Wild94.9...Looks like i'll be Movin'  back to Wild 94.9 and listen JV's morning show..|`|yVb5xDCLaa	I want to know too.

T5DbLLgQaa	It's indeed the second movement from Beethoven's 7th symphony. Sarah Brightman used it as well on her song "Figlio Perduto" and a boy group called Libera used it on their song "Sacris Solemnis" so it is used very often!|`|CrAwmz65aa	That's the second movement of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony.

LRLu1ofNaa	Rock & Roll by Eric Hutchinson?|`|D2C0OSenaa	rock and roll - eric hutchinson (i don't think i spelled that right)
iIBc2wmCaa	Well to boil this down quickly. They say Leo and Aquarius are compatiable cuz Leo are fire signs and Aqarius are Air signs. Fire likes to be around air since it kinda needs it and can be amplified by air. As an Air sign myself I can say its really easy to get attached to things espically when they seem interesting. You have to remember all of us Air signs (Libras, Aquarius and Gemini (me!) ) are the intellectual type and once we find something interesting we tend to want to be around it all the time, us Geminis tend to get bored alot faster tho then dissapear. There are a few other things to take into consideration when using astrology to assess someones personality traits. Their moon sign is important for example if he is a Air/Water like me he tends to be even more fickle. Air/Earth will embrace attachment even more cuz the earth weighs down the air. It gets complicated.<br>  <br>  But no not all Aquarius get attached but it may seem that way. They just dont know how to controll their interest.<br>  <br>  PS.<br>  <br>  The fastest way to get rid of an air sign is to become uninteresting. You should consider yourself lucky to have an air sign floating around you all the time since it means your interesting. But I can see how it can get annoying. The trickiest part is to find out how we find you interesting because it could be something really stupid to something really complicated.|`|l3b0hjdWaa	not all aquarius guys are like that. he must really be comfortable with you|`|to6JW3yFaa	Haha most girls out there who are dating an Aqua would probably wish to god that their Aquas were like the ones ur describing. Normally Aquas tend to not be really emotionally attached in their relationships... at least in the beginning. But once they get comfortable and see that they can trust u and think that ur an intersting and fun person to be around they become more attached... I think. At least some Aquas like urs obviously. Mine was pretty detached in the beginning, but now I feel he's becoming more and more attached. Texting me every day and talking to me every day (if not then every other day) for at least 3 hours on the phone. In the beginning I was lucky enough to talk to him for one hour once a week.<br>  <br>  This guy that ur hanging out with must be reallllly into u to say things like that. Haha are u sure he isnt a water sign like me? Im a Pisces and Im a sign right after Aquas so r u sure u havent got it mixed up by accident? lol jkjk ;)<br>  <br>  And yeah Aquas and Leos r supposed to be compatible because they're opposite signs. Plus fire and air go really well together. Of course u shouldnt follow astrology when it comes to relationships if u dont agree with it. Like Im supposed to go really well with Scorpios but I dont find them too great for me. I feel they get too jealous and possesive for my taste... or maybe that's just cause I got used to my Aqua haha. Good luck!!|`|PCAlAoDsaa	No, not all Aquarius men are like that. He likes you very much and feels very comfortable with you.<br>  Yes Aquarius and Leo are compatible for each other because they are opposites. Air and Fire go very well together.<br>  <br>  There is this sales insurance agent who I love very much and he is a very hot, attractive, handsome and sexy man who has a great and fantastic body. His whole body is perfect and excellent in every way. His name is Robert C. Reisig. He is a Aquarius and I am a Leo.<br>  He is very romantic, respectful, kind, sweet, trusting, loyal, faithful, honest, loving, caring, charming and a very hard-worker<br>  We get along with each other very good.|`|mTSOJKlyaa	signs have nothing to do with people<br>  <br>  that stuff is nonsense|`|ajzdsUldaa	I think all Aquarians are like that, to be honest. I know I certainly am and all the other Aquarians I know are.<br>  <br>  If simmers down quickly though, they can go off you within days in my experience. I can be totally devoted to someone one week, and dumping them the next, and I've known Aquarius friends do the same.<br>  <br>  To be honest, if you ever date a guy who becomes that attached to you, forget damn star signs - I'd count yourself lucky. At least he won't end up cheating on you and will be devoted to you. Can't see what's bad about that to be honest.<br>  <br>  My boyfriend is a Cancer and he was very obssessive and clingy in the beginning. It annoyed me too at first, but when I matured and fell in love with him, I realised I was the luckiest girl in the world.|`|nnpEcqZdaa	I am a Sagittarius and I have a long-time Aquarian friend who I recently had to wall off from my life.  The funny thing about it is that we're both guys and we're both straight!  But by the same token, I have an Aquarian girlfriend and we get along very well.<br>  <br>  The reason it's generally assumed that Leos and Aquarians get along really well is that they are polar opposites.  You're less likely to get along with signs that are not the same or complementary element (i.e. fire or air work well with either fire or air, water or earth work well with either water or earth).   In your case, it's very likely that the influence of other planets in your charts are causing the problems.  And, of course, you have to factor in the way you both were raised.  It's the whole nature vs. nurture thing.<br>  <br>  I've found that fixed signs (Leo, Aquarius, Scorpio and Taurus) tend to "get attached" more easily.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|YjWw5oDDaa	Okay I have been in 4 serious relationships all that were with an Aquarius, the first had an Aquarius moon, the next two were both Aquarius sun, and now my husband is an Aquarius rising and yes they all got very obsessed with me. My husband is more obsessed than the others were he won't leave me alone for more than a few minutes everyday, he always wants us to go everywhere together. Even though we have been together for a while now he is always staring at me telling me how beautiful I am. Don't get me wrong the attention at times can be wonderful but sometimes it gets to be a bit much. Plus the other Aquarius men I have been with are still very interested in me, even the first and we were together over 18yrs ago. We have a son together and he has told him before that I was the best woman he's ever been with. It could be coincidence but they all have that (I need you or I'll die) feel to them, and at one point in time in the relationship they all said they couldn't go on without me even the Aquarius I am with now.  <br>  <br>  I have to say with you being a Leo it has to be making you nuts cause I know how the lion wants it's space. Which with this sign will be almost impossible I am a Taurus sun with Pisces moon so by astrology standards I should love that kind of behavior and I find it to be a bit much. I actually thought I was the only one having this kinda problem with this sign. Also have you noticed that they would rather eat glass than look you in the eye and tell you the truth. Maybe not but I had to ask. <br>  <br>  Oh and for all the ppl out there that might say... if you know this why get involved with that sign well, I didn't know that they were all Aquarius until a year ago. It's not always so easy to get info from an ex  to look up their birth charts.

XOlnc8iBaa	I knew a woman who was one of Elvis's backup singers at the Las Vegas Hilton. She said he was a wonderful man, he would come into rehearsals at midday, when they were setting up the dinner room for the show, and Elvis knew everyone by name including the waiters, and would ask after their wives, and kids, again by name. Apparently he was completely unaware of his fame or position and was just like one of the boys. He was classy, kind, and obviously raised well.|`|8n3NvYQwaa	yes yes yes I did!  In 1955 I was stationed in Biloxi, Mississippi and me and five other guys went to a benefit concert for the Navy League down on the beach..  The headliner was Fats Domino and the under card read, New comer Elvis AAron Presley...   We sat in the front because we were like the guests of honor.  After the concert we went back stage and met Fats,  He introduced us to Elvis and it was really something to know years later that we had shaken the hand of Fats and Elvis...  Then in 1961, I was in Seattle, Washington for the World softball tournament and Elvis was there filming the worlds fair..  So I went over to see him, security would not let us in..  I told security to tell Elvis that Grant from the Navy League Show in Biloxi was here to see him,  He actually ran over and got us..  I would say he was about 5'11" tall and yes the nicest guy you would ever meet.   He took us to the top of the Space Needle and we took some pictures..

cdf99d56c45f3f4e746f613838231bc5aa	I think all signs have a cruel and mean streak, but yes, I know what you're talking about with regard to Cancerians. They are known to write people off just like that and they can be so stubborn. I'm a Scorpio and I personally think we can be so much meaner that we make the Cancer look like an angel....but yeah, my Cancer friend and I are not in good terms right now and he wrote me off so fast, but only for him to take it back and swallow it by trying to get back to my good side. The thing that baffles me about him is that he would criticize and bash people sometimes, and then the next day he'll feel sorry for that same person that he was bashing as if he never talked smack about that person yesterday. Oh that gets on my last nerve! There are ways to get around their so called evil ways. Simply just ignore them, they hate that.<br>  <br>  Let me just add that aside from those observations, I love Cancers! They just get me like that. I can be so much meaner...believe me. I'm sorry you got to experience their ugly side. But you know they must have been hurt or something cause  when they're happy they are just so gentle and kind and nice to be around.|`|DbNbWQflaa	well you must have peed in their cherrios, usually cancers are the most nicest and forgiving, tilll they get moody and crabby, but they have a reason dont doubt that,|`|Rs3ITS1Iaa	yes that is really true.<br>  I'm a cancer and I'm like that.<br>  I guess it's because were so sensitive and when we get hurt we take it out on others.|`|ykIleAQ7aa	No, but I do know what you mean. We can be very detached from others. <br>  <br>  I'm a Cancer but I'm not cruel or mean and if I am mean its because someone provoked me to be mean to them. Other than that I'm a sweetheart.|`|HQFUnslhaa	I'm a Cancer and I think it's true. Sometimes I can be SO mean and other times I'm the sweetest person you have ever met. We're just weird like that.|`|15d1Ig0Haa	Cancers are mean when you F with them. Other than that they are really loving people.|`|3VKiFmMJaa	I think it is because they are hurting inside too! Try and go easy on them. I know I am extremely vindictive but Cancers are genuinely good people. If someone has betrayed my trust oh then it's over! But otherwise, we shouldn't be that bad, and if we are it is just that we are hurt and taking it out on others somewhat unintentionally|`|H7zl1XeFaa	I haven't had that problem. The meanest people I know are Sagittarius and Leo. They only seem to care about getting attention and they don't care who they hurt to get it. <br>  My mums a Cancer and she's really sweet.|`|hxrJo6Z4aa	I'm a cancer, I'm like that. I mean I'm really nice but I tend to have a bad attitude and when I'm upset I take it out on others, I'm moody a lot.|`|mG8gDExGaa	I'm a cancer and i can be moody for no reason.

You can run around the track, I'll just stay standing right at the finish line to greet you.<br>  <br>  Its great that you are a fast runner, but whats the point in running if you just end up where you started?|`|s4VzPulYaa	This question kind of makes you sound full of yourself.<br>  <br>  I'm not anywhere close to a distance runner, but how bout we race around the softball bases, then I know I would beat you!<br>  I'm super quick around the bases!|`|aae4d303fe9bd3bec8a94721211dbfbcaa	no i cant.|`|0s30aQC6aa	You look so hot....,damn!!|`|5dc321047bfeffd51f5af674b52dfb66aa	wow just get over yourself|`|FrWhdRL1aa	Yes,,or at least I think so.|`|Oa4QZGXSaa	in a car I would|`|GyFwkIbEaa	umm depends on how fast you are...|`|vX5ZzyVkaa	haha prob not<br>  but maybe if i had a monster before<br>  and you were kinda slow|`|0lYFHqJLaa	hmm idk it depends how fast you are :P|`|VEzNOVSPaa	Sprinting I  actually might be able to.

eoknbXcTaa	I know exactly what you mean. I admit, I did read the first one. It had its good parts and I enjoyed it but you have to draw the line somewhere. When you have a family of vampires, just leave it at that, why introduce werewolves? I almost expected sprites and pixies to be introduced into the expanding group of mythical creatures. Now everywhere you go you see something for Twilight and everyone is in love with Edward. Please everyone, stop having fantasies about this imaginary vampire! Thank you for giving me somewhere to vent my frustrations on this subject!|`|4q4Jalvzaa	i don't i love the books <br>  BUTTT<br>  I do wish they hadn't made a movie because if they didn't then you would not hear I LOVE EDWARD.|`|Qo6UWVaeaa	you are the only one who thinks this....|`|gfB5VNXTaa	Yeah, Twilight is one of the most over-worshipped things in history, as well as one of the most annoying too.|`|i9hHL7oNaa	I agree. Its like every other page it had something like "edward looked like a god...edward was an angel...the most handome man ever..." ok,we get it! he's hot! you dont have to remind it to us every other minute.<br>  its ridiculous. bunch of other books (good literature) that are outshined by this crappy vampire series.<br>  <br>  Booo for Steph.|`|NLwfMSJWaa	seriously|`|QziBNh0Uaa	Not me. I love Twilight!|`|P4WJD6Cpaa	Yeah well I feel the same way about Harry Potter.|`|a91c04be6d5e8df70950da96dda2861caa	i dont know, i mean i like the book but i am not obsessed with it like other people are<br>  <br>  i read it when it first came out which was about 2 years ago before everyone started to obsess over it then it just got annoying|`|GWv92NUhaa	Well honestly its a bestseller, but I dont see why. The plot is not strong...so I dont know. There seems to be TONS of people who are obsessed with it. i guess I'm just not one of them.|`|5cKkUyoEaa	i know it was a good book but not as great as everybody is making it up to be i like the clique series myself tho but were there are people there are followers|`|1HnJXVSHaa	ha, i have to agree with you 100%.<br>  i couldn't even get through the first book. it had no PLOT. i had to give up after like page 250.|`|n31VupXoaa	i like the books i own all of them but the movie not so much . little girls are just talking about how cute edward is blah blah and they get made when i tell em his fake hahha|`|dbbea67ddb711013c25857de95e5ded0aa	i know!<br>  so annoying|`|fp4mChXHaa	well little teenage girls get all horny for guys they will never have|`|dGpj4WOIaa	I enjoy reading them.....but im not a weird fangirl..xD

mggll8dRaa	Spiders are a great part of our Eco-System....!!|`|OD3hxWxvaa	No, but I am scared of hobos. And for a good reason.<br>  <br>  One day I went to the store to get a gallon of milk. I was walking down the aisles towards the checkout lanes after finally choosing my milk. I was just strolling along and I glanced at the aisle containing the sodas and other beverages and I noticed something moving on one of the shelves. I walked over to investigate and as I neared, I realiazed it was a man. He jumped up and I jumped away, startled. He was wearing only a trashbag reaching to his bellybutton, nothing else. I said, "I'm sorry sir, I didn't mean to wake you. Is there anything I can do?" <br>  He said, "Emmaglidshin..." <br>  I said, "What..?"<br>  He repeated the same thing, but slower, "Eeeemmmmaaagggliiidsshhhinnnn..."<br>  He smiled, and at that moment, I realized.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  He had no tounge.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I was immediatley scared for my life. I started to walk away slowly. He said, "Manggoopshalala."<br>  I said, "I'm sorry sir, I have to go..."<br>  I started to walk away quickly. Then I heard something... He was running after me.  He began screaming. I just got so scared, I turned and threw the carton of milk at him.<br>  <br>  <br>  It hit him in the face.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Then......<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  He had no eye.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  It slowly rolled under the aisle containing the bread. I ran for my life as the man with the trashbag screamed.<br>  <br>  Even to this day, I still hear his haunting screams, "OOgshmijiligweewee|`|AA11609168	i hated you....you were all around my house when i was a kid.  Sure you are not poisonous and dont go after people...but you look scary as hLL|`|4nQVsEHnaa	there is only one spider I'm not scared of|`|rcHnA1iQaa	yes indeed I am (sorry)|`|IqoRBVUTaa	Well I wouldn't pet you......But I'm defiantly not afraid of them.

On others it doesn't. It all just depends. But really, I know this sounds cheesy, but it's the inside that counts. It's kinda silly to judge based on glasses.|`|9DjMGv5Uaa	<<<Absolutely.<br>  <br>  Honestly though. The glasses don't "make" the face. The face makes the glasses.

AA10784260	Yeah i think i belong to the wrong era|`|j6poSs16aa	I would have loved to have been alive in the 50s because it was safer for children to go outside and play without their parents having to worry about where they were. <br>  but I would miss having an iPod back then!<br>  So, I think that I would be more happy|`|kdv0t93Faa	less happy, my mom told me she met my dad because she used to throw eggs at him when he was playing in his tree house. >.> they lived in a weird hipster place that i would hate to go. my mom was funky. >.<|`|zm7bCfzKaa	Happier.<br>  <br>  <br>  I'm from the south.<br>  Back then, everyone was so much more real && true to their roots.<br>  Didn't care what others thought, or what was cool.<br>  <br>  People actually had morals back then && stuck to 'em.<br>  Plus the music was so much better.|`|vBIwaQ0qaa	More happier and slower paced than it is now. The 50's were great years and I wish they could come back.|`|dkPbRn95aa	more happy. because of the gas and stuff. it was the 80s but im sure id be better off driving my 1971 6-7mpg truck in the 80s than now.|`|eVPW1dwOaa	More, my generation sucks. I've always felt uncomfortable here... like a generation transvestite or something, haha.|`|jeLehwmpaa	i think i would be way happier growing up in the 60s woooo pot party and go protesting awsome time|`|30bec3177e3b5db11c5b72b82bf84bb5aa	More..it was the golden era of jazz..and no loud cell phone talkers!|`|KKhc5UiYaa	more happy cuz mary J was better back then|`|LOgmCZdzaa	Maybe, because I think the world was a little more innocent then than it is now lol. And things cost less too!|`|1DTVKkoBaa	More.<br>  i loveee the 60s and 70s.|`|lfJ5Jxxwaa	Yeah, this era made me too gangsta|`|Yh4CXJgdaa	loool <br>  agree with jennna w! lol<br>  good question btw|`|HF1TfsnTaa	Less, they didn't have sh*t.|`|PpWosZsIaa	My Parents grew up during the Great Depression. Dad was born in 1922 and Mom in 1924. Dad passed in 2004, Mom passed in 2005. I miss both of them dearly.|`|3u4HU7rdaa	uhhhhhhhhh. do you have any idea of how annoying it is? everytime i throw away something that could be eaten one bite more, they go blowing off me and telling me stories of how they had nothing. NO WAY i am happy in my time.<br>  the internet is faster, and better manga. + youtube. gawd, no i am grateful. +there's war too back then, so uh no way.|`|GR2XNzCCaa	I don't think now I could survive as a teen back in the 60's and 70's, so I'm just gonna have to say just as happy if I was born then. But if I was sent back in time today at the age I am now to the 70s, I'd be less happy.|`|fSlCE0jBaa	I'D BE HAPPY! Are you kidding mee. Good music. and i'd rather wear those bell bottoms than the skinny jeans worn today. <br>  <br>  and yes I LOVE the 60's and 70's. They interest me ;)|`|hVGyhpMmaa	More happy.|`|KaAXJJo8aa	yes because back then people had better morals -_-|`|mQ5v9KUWaa	more happy<br>  <br>  because its safer and the fashion through the years would get fun unlike the repeating fashion nowadays. Just the time, the way they talk, the way they wore their hair. Its just seems like fun to me.|`|FttPArZ7aa	less.<br>  My parents were my age in the late 70s and there was civil war gaging in El Salvador [which is where they're from.]<br>  I'd rather be here. At home. With no war, well, in my homeland at least.|`|BZwJeuMGaa	i'd love to live in the 70's haha. those were the best years so i hear. <br>  <br>  ive always felt i was born in the wrong time..... im ment to be a hippie.|`|ij9N9r5waa	I think I would be a happier more stable well adjusted person then I am.had I grown up it their time, but I would like to be 21 now.|`|8tRY1U2Iaa	The music was definitely better in the 60s and 70s than it is today.|`|0PVp8Okoaa	More happy definitely. Our society today, pressure is all around us.|`|rpbOSyJ3aa	Less.  There were less people in my mom's school/era...And, I'm a pretty social person.|`|fT15YEkFaa	less, hard times
9f0d54c35894f05249bcafb57c720e4baa	......"You Never Called Me By My Name".....David Allen Coe....|`|7d2928f852362ce15ddfc514db718d5daa	fyi.. this great song was also recorded by Doug Supernaw, But David Allen Coe's version will always be the best.
X1uOh8ylaa	She was definitely good and probably should have been given a wild card spot but I was reaaaaaaaaaaaaally disappointed that Ju'Not Joyner didn't get another shot. He was absolutely wonderful last night! What is it with the guys when they sing "Hey there, Delilah"? Isn't that what Jamar sang also during Hollywood week? With the exception of a few of the contestants-- American Idol seems pretty blah this year!!!|`|9rz9XJdQaa	i completely agree! tatianna and matt and ricky? strange choices. i was like as long as norman and nathaniel don't get through. felicia was amazing!|`|WaYZQhnHaa	I was very disappointed that Felicia didn't make it through.  I thought she was really good.  <br>  Not at all surprised that Miss Drama Queen (Tatiana) is being given another chance.  (((eyeroll)))  lol|`|dD6bmcTZaa	No all the people that they brought back through the wildcard suck...Her and Ju'Not Joyner should of gotten wildcard spot.|`|ANLbWyMeaa	"...how on earth could Felicia not be picked as wildcard?"  How on earth was Felicia not in the original top 36?  Demographics.  Ratings.  Blah. Blah. Blah.  It's not like it's a talent show or anything.  <br>  <br>  I'm finding the top 12 so far to be disappointing.  Of the 8 named to the wildcard round, I personally think only 4 should have been there.  I don't think Jasmine was horrible overall, but I wasn't blown away seeing her over the weeks.  I was surprised they brought her back.  Tatiana is definately not a surprise.  What bothers me, is thinking that there is no intention of letting Tatiana through, and having her return purely for ratings.  Her spot could have been given to someone else (and I too, REALLY wanted Felicia to have another shot).   <br>  <br>  The format this season was horrid.  I'm pretty sure tomorrow will kill the rest of the season for me.|`|NtFutamfaa	felicia is from my hometown of virgina beach,va.....she did great last night<br>  <br>  but its just a show and its nothing we can change.....im rooting for ricky and danny|`|6S8KjBLQaa	You have to keep in mind hollywood week, audition, etc. Jasmine had a spectacular Hollywood week and deserves another chance (as did Matt G and Anoop). The others, suck. Felicia is amazing, the judges just don't like her...Ann Marie didn't make it either, even though she's great. The judges picked some weird choices, like who is RIKKY BRADDY?! Who is VON SMITH?!|`|AA11111233	I, too, was disappointed that Felicia didn't get in.  Her rendition of "No One," while not a showstopper, was one of the better performances I've heard.
qNKK4hLDaa	yeah i'm sort of a clean freak<br>  but if i got any weird pervy creepy vibes from them, i'm sure i'd be fine bathing in my own sweat lol|`|PCAlAoDsaa	There is this sales insurance agent who I love very much and he is a very hot, attractive, handsome and sexy man who has a great and fantastic body. His whole body is perfect and excellent in every way. His name is Robert C. Reisig.<br>  He is very romantic, respectful, kind, sweet, trusting, loyal, faithful, honest, loving, caring, charming and a very hard-worker.<br>  His house is the only house that I would take a shower in.<br>  <br>  No I would not take a shower in a stranger's house.|`|wDJRyzE9aa	Sure as long as they have a clean bathroom, fresh towels and plenty of spare footie pajamas!|`|ZSlXrXsCaa	Yes|`|AA10297143	Why not?

Mine wasn't cancelled, but I did get done way earlier than I would have if I went to work., and I even called my boss well before quitting time to let her know I wasn't chosen and would return to work the next day.    Even so I had a piece of paper to show that I went. <br>  <br>  When you say cancelled what do you mean? That you weren't picked after all?   That you were prepared to go but you were notified at the last minute that it was cancelled (and for what reason?)  They should still be able to provide you with a necessary document to show your employer.)<br>  <br>  Ask your employer what they require in the way of documentation and they might even be able to assist you in obtaining it.<br>  <br>  To co-workers?  Yeah--did you call up and find out you didn't have to report?  I dunno--they might enjoy you telling them that you shafted them--lol.|`|FomIa9jQaa	That everything went good
FomIa9jQaa	Yes i do|`|384jaNQoaa	What would we be without high school musical, we would be bored to death without those fantastic movie to completely mock.

6zdmzdQ2aa	Let me start off my saying I LOVE "Banana Pancakes," Jack Johnson is really good.  I listen to a whole lot of different music, everything from Jack Johnson and Bob Marley, slow beach music, to hip hop.  If you had said that you and your friend just didn't like the same kind of music this would be way different.  If she always is obnoxious about which music you listen to, and what's considered "cool," then you should tell her that she's acting really immature and needs to get over herself.  I know it's hard, I'm fifteen too, will be sixteen next week, and my friends do little things like that to drive me nuts all the time.  But when they do it all the time, and when your with them so often, eventually you just HAVE to tell them when they're doing something that's driving you nuts.  If you weren't good friends and it was just some random person then I would say dump her! But nobody wants to loose a best friend like that.  Good luck!|`|UsEMh8V7aa	I love "Banana Pancakes"!!!!! Just tell her that if she wants to listen to your iPod, she'll have to refrain from criticizing your taste in music.<br>  <br>  Tell her to get her own iPod if she wants to listen to  "non-crap."<br>  Just tell her in a nice way and politely take back your iPod.<br>  <br>  Good luck =]|`|SOGkJSN4aa	I know how you feel! Whenever i'm with my cousin she gets so mad when i listen to the music i want in the car, such as metallica, avenged sevenfold, black sabbath, etc., because she LOVES country music! she's not even from the south or whatever, i don't know why she listens to it. i think it sucks.<br>  how about the next time your friend disses your music tell her to shut the f*ck up lol|`|qwInrvUGaa	shes a sheep (follower) ignore her<br>  <br>  banana pancakes is a good song<br>  <br>  tell her if you don't like it buy your own ipod and put the songs  you like on it|`|IcXXJNPJaa	Because she's dumb. She just doesn't want to appreciate how thoughtful you are. Dumb that *****, or tell her "hey if you don't like my music, get your own damn ipod!"|`|ohHEQimxaa	porque ella no es tu amiga.|`|0Tew2jDlaa	just ignore her shes bein a b*tch|`|8OREBeRdaa	My ex was the same way.  There'd be music that I'd like and she'd say "How can you listen to that crap? It all sounds the same!"  I remember one time we were @ her place and she said "Why don't you put some music on?"  I replied "Because I don't feel like listening to TOOL for the 1000th time!"  Then she proceed to ***** me out because I was "rude" but she had no problem with saying my music was crap.<br>  <br>  Look, Listen to what you want to listen to.  If the other person doesn't like it then jam your ear bud into their eye to shut them the hell up!  Life is too short to have other people dictate what you listen to.  The same thing goes with riding in my car.  If you don't like my music, then you have 2 legs and a @#$%ing heartbeat, you can walk your @$$ to where you need to go!|`|J0VzIyYjaa	omg! i had a friend like that and it would piss me off so much. I eventually just ignored her and she always ended up listening to my other friends mp3. I would just tell her that if she doesn't like the song she doesn't have to freak out she can just say "can you pick another song?" in a nice way.|`|sAi6T0pSaa	Sometimes people do not like anything unless they're the ones that chose it.  It's a control issue.  It's possible she is having troubles in her home life and cannot stand not having the control because her home life is so out of control.  Just a thought!|`|JzfCH1mJaa	Sounds like she's under the peer pressure of 'being cool'. It's hard to deal with people when they're under that influence. Let her know that she's doing it and you can't understand why she feels that way. See how she responds, maybe it's something subconscious.|`|P3s3UIlcaa	like that song.|`|itOkhYZaaa	she's jealous of your amazing music choices!!!!!!! seriously though|`|8j3DW6Vaaa	She has no taste of her own.|`|8l0abDyOaa	Depends on like lots of crap...<br>  <br>  i mean is where you guys live people make fun of Jack Johnson?<br>  If it is then she probably just wants to not be caught by the "popular" fags ...srry.... <br>  <br>  Maybe she doesnt like those genres<br>  <br>  For me I love listening to rock<br>  Here are some reccomandations you could use for the different genres<br>  <br>  Rock- Back In Black - ACDC....Also listen 2 Beast and the Harlot by Avenged Sevenfold<br>  Pop- Take a bow- Rihanna<br>  Country- Some Faith Hill or Rascal Flatts <br>  <br>  <br>  ** if u like JAck Johnson u probly will like radiohead or death cab for a cutie.|`|nJItbwKiaa	The music you might like listening to may not be considered "cool" in her category. Don't take any offense whatsoever.  She probably doesn't like the music you listen to and that's ok.  She's basically being a control freak over the music. I would say that you listen to your own ipods for now on so you don't have this problem.

HZxX9ke8aa	air signs are less trustworthy with their flightiness and carelessness. fire signs, they can get mad and tell everyone so easily. water, cancer getting moody, scorpio avengeful and pisces feeling wronged can tell too, it's a possibility.<br>  <br>  earth signs known with their "inner" stability. if you find a certain earth trustable he will not tell even when it's over i guess.<br>  <br>  even if not trustable i'll still stalk librans though :/<br>  <br>  one should believe in himself, his own integrity and stop being insecure. if he wants to live something real he should just put real feelings into that relationship or he will live a simulation of that relationship. and one should also learn when it's time to move on, that person doesn't worth to effort if things go bad. there's just no other way. <br>  <br>  as samuel beckett says; always tried, always failed. tried again, failed better. (or something like that)|`|TjrnVFVRaa	Taurus! <br>  <br>  There is no comparison! Taureans are the most trustworthy, honest, intelligent, creative, talented, reliable, attractive, good looking, compassionate, understanding, fascinating, hard working, and most modest and humble of all the signs!<br>  <br>  I'll bet you can guess my sign! LOL|`|AA12215623	Virgo, Aqaurius, one scorpio, and other cancers. Sorry can't choose just one.<br>  I guess if I had to based on my experience Virgo. They dont' seem to have any hidden motives or agendas to worry about, aren't sneaky, are very down to earth. My bestie of over 7 years is a Virgo and I write this based on my experience with her. Oh yea they give very good advice.|`|AsLTO8CTaa	i trust taurus and aquarius the most. im a taurus and i know how loyal and trustworthy we can be. my ex is a aquarius and my best friends are aquarius and nothing ive said to them has every left that room|`|bvwYVGJOaa	To me it's all based on the person not the sign but i can spot on who i feel i can trust so it would Sags (Fcking hot as well as good ppl), Tauruses (funny, attractive and loyal) And Virgos like me of course!|`|JTSNljLhaa	Pisces are|`|ee1TLZ2gaa	Scorpio, because they trust themselves.|`|0047572b741498da2d839902d6863185aa	Taurus<br>  <br>  my both parents<br>  my best friends<br>  <br>  love<br>  Pluto|`|zAhF9q4Laa	aries. but once aries decide to move on, den u got to give up becos aries dun turn back to u. but when aries in a r/s with someone.they can be really faithful to u but nv step on his tail ..becos they will remember n if u do it again,they will F u off.. <br>  <br>  my ex bf is an aries|`|DUCoaMKzaa	Scorpio... They are extremely loyal and are always here in times of trouble and toil.

They are just awesomely reliable and together. If I was a boss I think I'd hire an army of virgos. This is a generalisation, but that has been my experience anyway.<br>  <br>  Pisces|`|uel6NBOVaa	The one that has proven me they are worthy of my trust.<br>  <br>  Edit: I am giving my honest answer though. I wouldn't trust anyone based on the qualities of their sign. I'd need to look at the whole chart to really know anything about them. Also, unless I'm close to someone and feel deeply in my heart that they are trustworthy, I wouldn't trust them at all. <br>  <br>  If I was looking for security, I would go towards those with Scorpio influence. My boyfriend has a Scorpio Moon conjunct Pluto, and I have no fear of him leaving me, unless I betray him.|`|f63f9f351cf19e94cff59963c9708a3daa	hmm....we'll i'm a scorpio sun and a pisces moon and i tend to trust scoprio moons a lot...and they are quite trustworthy..unless you get on thier bad side that is, but i know better than that...also, pcaricorns, they're quite reserved and arent interested in gossipping one bit, and altho they might seem cold and unemotional, they do care about how you feel and they have no interst in hurting your feelings...virgos are just as private if not more since they have tons of aquintances and very few actual friends to whom they might not even reveal themselves to -- so there are a lot of things that you just dont know about these people until THEY themselves open up about everyhting they've been through, and its surprising how you dont see any of it when you meet them -- i think this is why people think virgos are boring, cuz they dont tend to show a lot of over-enthusiasm in anything and dont talk much about themselves or dont have a bunch of funny stories to tell like their gemini buddies, but thats because they dont belive in drama and things like that and would rather keep to themselves. Which mean sthey will keep your secret too -- thats just how they are ^-^<br>  <br>  <br>  adn yes this is based on personal experience but it makes sense on a zodiac level too...my mom is a capricorn with a cancer moon ( makes her soo motherly ^-^) and my dad is a virgo sun with aries moon (or taurus not sure)...|`|sCr2iTczaa	I have found that Sagittarius's' are pretty loyal, they are very kind people and i get along with them just great, also i have met some Aquarius' and they seem pretty loyal, and very good friends... Also leo's are very loyal themselves which i happen to be a leo.|`|8ZUVToXgaa	I guess Tauruses. We tend to be super-dependable although a bit critical.<br>  <br>  I honestly can't think of a more trustworthy sign though. So I'm sticking by my sign.<br>  <br>  Taurus sun, Virgo moon, Leo rising.|`|aOy01jFEaa	Based on my personal experiences..<br>  My parents both LEOs betrayed me (sob).<br>  The man I formerly loved was a LEO betrayed me too (sob).<br>  Though, I'll never judge all Leos that way. It's not fair to some real fiercely loyal and trustworthy Leos too.<br>  I am a cusp bt. Pisces & Aries..So I may personally tell <br>  that a TAURUS friend was the most tried practical and honest person I have known..I think they're mostly rich people..Who never fails to be honest with life in a very practical way..'Tends to tounge slash other only but with sincerity and hoping for more realistic improvements.<br>  <br>  I love Scorpions...But as deadly as they can sting when they're pissed off..& That intrigues me so much, for you may sense one such as with (like hidden) powerful and mysterious force.<br>  Virgos demand honesty too cause they really are honest people too..<br>  However, most Cancerians I know are clever and have best nuturing abilities, that makes them trustworthy too..(they even tend to be martyrs when devoted) Lovers of peace and harmony that makes them stand off mostly from other star signs. <br>  The rests can be truly honest though, more of fun lovers..(or playful wanting more excitements, not only in a negatve way)<br>  <br>  <br>  I think, it makes more sense rather knowing and not judging an individual's characteristics based to their astrological signs. We can't even make real valid accurate judgements even through personal experiences at times. Because people or things still changes whether for better or worst in time and different situations. Unless, if the flaw of one's distinctive character stubbornly persisted on with destructiveness, regardless of it's birth sign too.<br>  Then one might be better off using his own best judgement. Sensibly by not generalizing mostly of the same or similar star symbol (sign)..<br>  <br>  This is only an opinion. Every sign has its own remarkable distinctively 'reliable' traits at its best! It's only perhaps a matter of enhancement and developing out these unique magnificent characteristics  (as hidden potentialities) to come out (discover) and be readily aware of.<br>  <br>  (Pluto is my inspiraton to this answer, A loving mysterious Scorpion) If ever I am right then I owe it to him..If I am wrong..I still go with him!

508607ab41c5f2849e90ee5b3de45dd6aa	well i am glad that 2 indians won oscars. but i am not happy with the way India is portrayed in it. i agree that the movie was some what realisitc. but i feel taht it was somehow exaggerated too. Isnt poverty a reality even in AMerica. how many american films have come out about that? while i agree that slum is a relaity, i strongly feel that this poverty is NOT what India is all about. This movie is nothing but clever marketing, giving the west what they want to see about India.From the earlier times the west have had a fixed notion about India- earlier it was the land of beggars, snake charmers and maharajas( thanks to british raj). Now it is the slum India or bollywood or MysticIndia that they focus on. unfortunately this movie too enhances that idea. i find that another guy has posted a question in yahoo" are the slums in India taht filthy? And i find that Justin H answered taht they are filthy. and as evidence he has presented the google map of the city!!!!!They dont realize taht there is a great life thriving outside these areas. Look at mumbai. can u ever find a more vibrant city-a city of ultimate spirit.The movie is nothing but clever marketing.Better movies have been made abt India.|`|ATHzA9Cpaa	The point of the movie was to show a rags to riches tale based in a country different from what most movies show. It wasn't supposed to show how awesome India is. <br>  If someone made a movie about the homeless in NYC and only showed those parts...I wouldn't complain about not flattering America.|`|BJugETlOaa	I thought it was an awsome movie and I think there are plenty of movies out there that show the bad about America, if it is something that is untrue then I say you would have right to be mad but if it is a acurate description of what it is really like then quit griping. It was a good movie and it showed what a part of your country is like, People know that not all of India is like that. It is a movie for goodness sakes.|`|3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	Your criticisms are unfair and inaccurate. While the movie did show the slums, it didn't dwell on them. It was a fictional story about these three particular people and what they go through. Criticizing the film for showing the slums - especially since it was done accurately - suggests that you don't want the world to know there are people living in poverty in India. Most of the recent movies set in India that have gained any popularity in the US have only showed the more well to do people - I'm talking about Bride & Prejudice and Monsoon Wedding. <br>  <br>  Furthermore, a portion of the proceeds from the movie are being reinvested into those same slums to help the children living there. <br>  <br>  Lastly, when I watched the movie, I did not take what I saw to be a representation of the entire country - or even the entire city of Mumbai. Just like when I see a movie set in some part of the US, I don't take it to be representative of the entire country.<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  For the person who is pointing out the plight of the young children in the movie, you have to realize the film makers faced a very difficult moral dilemma. What they did was get the kids into school and then put the majority of their salary into a trust fund they would get when they were older. The idea was to get them an education and then give them the money so they would be better equipped to use it to make a better life.<br>  <br>  Sure they could have just given them all the money right away. But what would have been the result? Would they have been a major target for theft and other crimes? Would they have known how to spend the money wisely?<br>  <br>  The other alternative would have been to take these uneducated people away from everything they know and put them in a nice home with nice schools. But given the lack of a support structure, would they have been able to thrive?<br>  <br>  Their goal was to do right for the kids so they might be able to benefit from the movie years after people had forgotten about the movie. <br>  <br>  The latest I heard on this issue, they put both of the families into apartments with the apartments in the kid's names. I don't know anything more than that.<br>  <br>  Also, they haven't mentioned how much money was put into trust for the kids because they didn't want to make them a target. But Danny Boyle has said many times that it was a substantial sum.|`|OqviBejiaa	I don't think it deserved 8 Oscars, but for different reasons than you point out. I just don't think it was that great of a movie. It was good, not great, certainly not the best picture of the year. <br>  <br>  In terms of interesting, challenging, provocative cinema, 'Slumdog' just isn't it. It's a cute romantic film, but not the best picture of the year in my opinion.|`|KOd5Spehaa	do you think that the boy in the movie should of at least  come out the slums he lives in.. making that movie wanna know how much he got paid for the movie .ali 710$ ismali 2,400$<br>  while american actors get paid millions <br>  fullstory here<br>  <a href="http://www.alternet.org/blogs/peek/123542/slumdog_millionaire's_child_actors_still_live_in_'grinding_poverty'_in_mumbai/.." rel="nofollow">http://www.alternet.org/blogs/peek/12354...</a>|`|tiGpryHiaa	no|`|azdw8fMlaa	I think it did deserve Best Picture, even though the depiction of India is not a flattering one. All cultures have movies that do not portray the members of it as thriving, useful members of society, but rather the underbelly of society. I live in Canada and here many people have heard of Deepa Mehta and the movies she has made that portray India with a kind of romanticism. She shows the most gorgeous aspects of India - full of love and passion. Don't worry - not one country is all good or all bad. We all have things we can learn from each other.

AA11640951	As Daniel says in tonight's episode, "What happened, happened".<br>  Much of our cast is now lost in the 70's during the time of Dharma.  Does this suggest that by being there, they effected time in such a way it lead up to all we've seen in the first four seasons?  <br>  <br>  My guess is that our folks need to go back because they have parts to play in the past they may not be aware they've already had a hand in.  If they aren't there, time will take a different course and this may have a nasty ripple effect on the world.|`|LBovv7Sxaa	they have to go back because they were never supposed to leave in the first place.<br>  they have a lot more work to do (like saving the Dharma Initiative from the Purge and to rescue Jacob).|`|7rtoFvj0aa	I think they have to go back to the 1970's in order to change the history of the island.|`|aBzRV8EXaa	I hope this is not some evil plan by ben,

CFZ4ISNNaa	The diplomatic answer would be: It's sweeps and Lie to Me (a new show) needs ratings. <br>  <br>  The fact of the matter is that racism is real. People in 2009 are still racist. I didn't watch the show, but if the dude was a white supremicist who targeted a black man...that would make perfect sense to for a white guy to be in the role.  It's demeaning to me when I see minorities  being portrayed as crackheads, prostitutes, and thugs.

d5SLRSjwaa	The custom of saying 'God bless you' when someone sneezes originated with the Black Death (Bubonic Plague) in which 1/4 of the population of Europe was wiped out. Sneezing was found to be a first sign that someone had the plague and to ensure one got into heaven they would be blessed by a local priest, bishop, or some other religious person. Then the clergy (church) members began to die as well, so no one was left to bless people. Whenever someone sneezed it would quickly be followed by 'God bless you'. After the first symptoms a person usually died within two to five days.|`|aNhvckHEaa	I think its supposed to be a short prayer.  Really I think it stems from way back when, ppl thought your soul could escape through your sneezes. So now ppl say God bless you, hoping that God will bless you with health.  Even tho ppl just say it just to say it now.  & no, God blesses who he chooses to bless.  I dont know why. "mysterious ways" yada yada yada|`|mc6tmR49aa	Its such a violent shock on your body your heart actually cant pump at that very split second!!!

Good guitars are still expensive, student/amateur guitars are still cheap.<br>  Never skimp when buying a musical instrument.

6PSnZDhDaa	Earlier Gaara wore his headband on the belt of his Sand Gourd and Shikamaru wore it on his arm and he still does... Ino wore it on her waist earlier but now I cant think of any place on her body where the band would go without making it stand out... <br>    Her waist would be too big for it... Maybe Kishimoto just let her be without one to keep her looking nice the way she does... If it goes on her head like Sakura's, it would look weird and even on her arm it would stand out, so she looks fine without one...|`|tLyfneelaa	im not really all that sure myself in the Shippuuden many characters have stopped wearing the headband seems strange that they would do that but maybe its a way of showing that they don't need a headband to show there loyalty to there village|`|nMKBhkJOaa	Ino probably does wear one but it cant be seen<br>  nd shikamaru does wear a headband-its on his right arm|`|tSU1BmGtaa	That headband looks annoying to wear on your head a day, i don't know why Masashi Kishimoto did what he did, but i m just giving u my oppinion. U no Shikamaru doesn't wear it either|`|Cj2uorAeaa	i think that given inos special talent (shintenshin) that she would make a good spy. the headband would give away that she is from konoha.   <br>  <br>  this is just my opinion on the matter

IDBpVfbUaa	First you need a Computer which you have obviously. Then you need a program to record. They have many and i suggest something like Sony cakewalk or acoustica mixcraft. Next you need a mixer or if you don't want to buy one just get a reducer that goes from a guitar cord to a headphone output you can get one at radioshack for about 4 bucks. then connect the guitar amp straight to the recording slot of your audio card and use the program to record.

5fR4QEznaa	It is quite great!|`|uGkKd6R2aa	Okay well, this is a good, though at the same time its kinda cheesy ^_^''<br>  <br>  Pros- Its like like super powers but with Gangs and mobs, drugs, etc. its pretty cool :)<br>  <br>  Cons- Why is his mom dead? Why were they capture the dad and son and kill the mom in the first place? Also, its kinda cheesy not in like clishe but as in, its happened a bit before. as you said here <br>  -"he end ups moving in with his best friend who only lives with his mom. they both decide to go kill whoever killed his mom" I've seen that a lot. The typical "lets kill them" and "one mother" and stuff...make it more original. And also the ransom of the gang in the end and stuff. Do something else and surprise the people! instead of either an email or internet or video message just go in and...idk, my head filled with other ideas at the moment ^_^<br>  <br>  Don't kill yourself though because there are more cons though! just figure them out! its not that hard :)<br>  Ehe, so this is what I think of your movie! <br>  Hope I helped :P
viAoOSXXaa	mm it's a good idea but if that's how you're going to start the movie, it doesn't exactly fit along with the plot. Maybe in the end instead of them being held hostage you could have another gang that says they know who killed the mom and then they have to go through quests to find the killer.<br>  <br>  either that or take out the beginning because I like the ending but the beginning doesnt quite fit.|`|TsRgRLuiaa	wait didn't i already answer this question lol<br>  i think it sounds good tell me when it comes out lol:)
zBkaqIWcaa	Need to work more on why the gang keep the father and the brother alive giving the other brother and the addict time to start their own mob group, raise power, etc. until suddendly they got that e-mail.<br>  <br>  How much time is between the murder of the mother and the receipt of the e-mail?|`|6gZynUKzaa	nice start to the story but then it gets weird and more bizzare but thats what i like and i would love to know the ending of this story|`|D3ep2x7caa	it sounds like it has potential to be a good story, but most of it seemed jumbled up. we wont know that his dad shot this guy who took his mom and brother who survived....so you are going to have to explain that in the movie in some way. also, what is the point of him basically becoming a drug addict WITH his friend? if he is helping his friend in any way, then they should have a different relationship where he helps him recover while finding his mom and brother. im not sure he should "create" a gang or mob, i think it should just be him and his friends, then other people help along the way. unless your trying to say that making gangs to save people is the way to go, i suggest you don't do that. other than that, the storyline your going for it good. be sure to make the climax crazy suspenseful. :)<br>  and good luck on making your movie. :D|`|yc4y7yKkaa	Overall it's okay...I guess. You need to answer a few questions though:<br>  <br>  1. Why would the gang kidnap the father and son? Kidnappings are done for two reasons: One; for ransom (money or to gain something tangible) and two; for perverse reasons (e.g. a pervert kidnaps a little girl and keeps her for years to do as he pleases...). My best guess here would be number one; but what would the gang get in exchange for the father and brother's safe return?<br>  2. Why wouldn't the main characters go to the police?<br>  3. Who is your main protagonist and antagonist? Surely the entire gang are not operating as a single antagonizing entity-- who is the ringleader?<br>  4. Kidnappings are time sensitive...why would your main character go through all the trouble of starting another gang/drug ring (which takes time) instead of actively working on getting his father and brother back?<br>  5. Emails are easily traceable; are your villains really that stupid? This doesn't hold up. Your main character could send that email to the police easily, which would defeat the purpose.<br>  <br>  <br>  There are some huge holes. The David versus Goliath revenge movie has been done many times, you need to up the stakes a bit. You have to be clever enough to write a well crafted script with nuanced characters and a plot sans gaping holes.|`|Ak7Gk0uxaa	Well I hate to say this, but it sounds a bit cliche,<br>  try spicing it up with some kind of weird connection, and have some characters say something kind of weird and make it appear obvious at the end of the movie to what they said.<br>  Or maybe have an IM sent many many times that says "HELP" from the mothers character and it was sent the same time you discovered the body(ies) or the time they were murdered.<br>  Or maybe even have one of the people from the gang/mob be the murderer...<br>  <br>  Well other than that, it sounds interesting, something I'd want to see in the theater in 3D(:|`|TsRgRLuiaa	sounds good tell me when it comes out lol|`|dY3FjdYPaa	It is pretty good towards the beginning of the idea, but as it progresses it kind of starts to be like every other mod movie....But if that is what youa re going for the go for it. But me personally, when i go to see a movie i want to see something i have never seen before.

ryLbKatoaa	Go to Sakuracon anyway...! It's amazing!<br>  <br>  And no, there aren't any real big ones other than that until you hit southern California. But other cons in and around Washington state (I'm assuming you live around this area...?) include Aki con (fall convention in Everett), Kumoricon (summer time convention in Portland, Oregon), MEW con (new years eve convention in Vancouver, WA), Chibi Chibi con (one day con in Olympia). There's also Anime Evolution in Vancouver BC, but I don't know much about it. <br>  <br>  Finally, there are monthly cosplay photoshoots in Seattle called Gasukans. You don't need to cosplay to participate and it's a great way to meet local anime fans.

frwlypDWaa	Try running two ten-minute miles. When you get that time down to nine-minute miles, add another mile. Slow and steady wins the race, and prevents injury. Stretch before and after, too. Walk everywhere you go. And enter a 5K race when you can do three miles comfortably. You'll be surprised how a little competition can shave time off your speed. Enjoy!|`|luwBPdE8aa	I would start out just running 100 yards and if that doesn't seem too hard, try a quarter mile.  Don't try to run it as fast as you can.  Later you might increase it to half a mile.  I think running a whole mile would be too much.

bsnnEsp5aa	Other than whats been said I think these are amazing ::<br>  <br>  Blood+ (supernatural, violence, vampires, action, mystery)<br>  In world where flesh-eating monsters roam the streets, only one organization has the means to save civilization from annihilation: Red Shield, a specially-organized unit designed to fight these monsters, and the only weapon that can destroy them: Saya. Awakened from a 30-year sleep, Saya is thrust into a modern world which she has no memories of, and is troubled by a past filled only with bloodshed and sadness. With the undying love and support of her family and friends, she struggles to gain the strength to move forward and regain the pieces of her shattered memories. <br>  <br>  Ayashi No Ceres (romance, love triangle, drama, supernatural, violence, josei, forbidden love, drama)<br>  There is a legend of an angel who fell to Earth many years ago, and was forced to marry a man because he held the key to her only way home. Hundreds of years later, sixteen year old Mikage Aya is the reincarnation of Ceres, the vengeful angel, who must now fight for her life against her family and her own twin brother Aki, the reincarnation of her past evil husband...<br>  <br>  NANA (love triangle, romance, josei, slice of life, drama)<br>  Nana Komatsu is on her way to Tokyo; now she can finally be with her boyfriend after a year of dating long-distance! On the train there, Nana Komatsu meets Nana Osaki – a girl who shares her name but seems to be everything Nana Komatsu is not; cool, street-wise, and a punk rocker. The two hit it off and spend the entire journey getting to know each other, but when they get to Tokyo, circumstance separates them seemingly forever. However, fate is not finished with these two. Whilst hunting for a place to live the two Nanas again cross paths. They decide to share a flat and become best friends in no time. Nana K. must learn to be independent and mature, while Nana O. works on becoming famous with her band; but together, they will learn about love and loss, and the growth that comes with it.<br>  <br>  Saikano (romance, war, tragedy, high school, drama)<br>  In the not-so-distant future, mankind is at war with itself. The lives of Chise and Shuu are torn apart when Chise is chosen to become the ultimate weapon to fight for Japan against their enemies. Death, sadness, and the hardships of love accompany Sai Kano in its grim look at war and its consequences.<br>  <br>  Air (drama, supernatural)<br>  The 'girl in the sky' is a legend passed down through the ranks of one special family. Armed with the magical puppet skills he learned from his mother, Kunisaki Yukito follows in her footsteps, traveling from place to place, ever searching for that girl in the sky, ever chasing after that legend. His journeys have led him to a small costal town where he meets a girl that has a peculiar interest in him -- could she be the one? As events slowly start to unfold in front of his very eyes, Kunisaki Yukito finds himself amidst a story that spans a thousand summers...<br>  <br>  Kanon (romance, drama, harem, supernatural)<br>  It's been seven years since Yuuichi Aizawa returned to the city he once lived in as a child. Though many things happened to Yuuichi in his past, he can only remember bits and pieces. His parents left Yuuichi in the care of Akiko once again, and this time, he will attend the same school as his cousin Nayuki. Many different girls appear before him, and some of them seem to know him from his past. Yuuichi must now recover his memories of the dark secrets that he erased from his heart, before he loses his precious ones.<br>  <br>  Ef - A Tale of Memories (romance, love triangle, high school, drama)<br>  In a high school setting, there are many people whose stories must be told: Hiro, an aspiring manga artist whose view of the world is "missing a certain color," according to himself; his childhood friend Kei, who is vying for his attention; Kyosuke, a photographer and cameraman who seeks to capture true emotion in his work; the ever-cheerful Miyako, who meets Hiro by chance and immediately becomes attached to him; the gentle Renji, unsure of his aspirations to become a novelist; and Kei's mysterious and quiet sister Chihiro, who seems to be a different person every day. As time passes and they interact with one another more, their paths increasingly intertwine as shades of regrettable pasts emerge.<br>  <br>  Basilisk (ninja, war, tragedy, drama, violence, historic, action)<br>  Oboro, a naive, love-struck girl, is pledged to Gennosuke, an idealist. Bothare successors to opposing ninja clans with a long history of hatred kept barely in check by a covenant of peace. Just as the two vow to reconcile the clans with their marriage, the shogun orders the feud to resume in order toresolve an internal struggle that threatens to tear the Tokugawa shogunate apart. Even worse, Oboro and Gennosuke themselves are forced to lead their clans in battle. Can the star-crossed lovers resist the brutal circumstances and remain true to their love as the death toll rises?|`|hSpsroCXaa	I second what Mic said, Grave of the Fireflies.

rNqF4gIVaa	I seriously doubt the authenticity of your violin ( there are so many fakes like that, however you should take the instrument to a reputable luthier and have it appraised.|`|HS7qRRiWaa	You will have to contact a reputable auction house for an appraisal. In NY and CA places like Sotherby's. This may be a nice piece for auction. Remember the appraiser gets a fee. Some times the fee is a percentage of the value. If you want to try the free route you can bring it to a respected university's art history department and they can at least give you an idea of value or if it's genuine.|`|vsy4QMHMaa	Why would anyone have a 360 year old violin that "needs to be restrung." If it's a true antique you would already have the provenance, and you certainly wouldn't be asking at Y!A for advice on how to sell it.<br>  <br>  .... My uneducated guess from however many thousand miles away and without looking at the thing is that it is indeed a copy, probably from the 1920s and made in Germany or Romania.

AA11111233	I want Sharon to do something with that scraggly hair besides leave it hanging.  She looks like the stripper she originally wanted to be.

N2XKAzZQaa	haha, don't we all just push buttons..<br>  i know i do.<br>  <br>  :)|`|wZloBlGlaa	i just push buttons, and i do pretty damn well!|`|y8Td9Ffraa	Push buttons ?_?|`|AA11609168	i pushed the buttons at random....i tried to read the instructions but then it got complicated and I just said screw it|`|mfwDnMupaa	Yes, I do know how to play it. I can beat it on hard.|`|1UKAho1iaa	I'm not gonna lie, I just push buttons.|`|TApVoMdAaa	I set it up so there are 10 bomb thingies only and like 500 squares, 2 clicks and I win!!|`|1HnJXVSHaa	I STILL push random buttons. i just know i'm not supposed to get crossed through the smiley faces, ahahah.

I always start in two corners, if things don't open up by then, I go for a third corner and sometimes the fourth. Once in a while, though, there will be a bomb and I just need to reset it. It's a good game to play when I don't have much time and just want to be distracted.|`|BY6OSDSeaa	i actually didnt until literally last weekend!! my brother knew and told me how, and even knowing how its still a pretty boring game if you ask me, i have better things to do than push buttons (even if they ARE random)|`|NnHIwYJuaa	idk....I just have fun pressing the buttons...but then if i'm unlucky the littel guy goes  * BOOM *...then i go cry...then I play again....but then he goes * BOOM * again....and then i go cry again... ik.. .its such a sad cycle :)|`|b6c9b3f40f9ac8337ea22396c739b02faa	I've played it all of twice in my life, and no, I have no earthly idea how to play... can you tell me?<br>  <br>  WTF is with the thumbs down, is it top secret info or something?

STUJOkAraa	I am thrilled that I did not vote for Obama. Yes, he does contradict himself all the time. What have you people done??|`|UjtK5m7Raa	not old enough to vote but followed the election<br>  thought McCain was the better out of the two worst<br>  i hate how people make such a big deal that our president is African American. They are basically calling America racist . I like Obama but i don't think that it should have been that big of a deal.(he does change his mind a lot)|`|3SKcLGG7aa	I did not vote for him....|`|8j3DW6Vaaa	Yes I am very happy. Hooray!|`|wZloBlGlaa	i didn't vote for Obama|`|6c7e9e289fd5db36cd934c29dca6003eaa	No I am glad I voted McCain but sorry that so many other people fell into his trap.|`|QziBNh0Uaa	Are you sure you're not confusing him with Dubya? I am glad I made a morally and socially responsible decision by voting for Obama.|`|vlvOkbaAaa	Yes. He has 21st century positive and strong ideas.|`|i9hHL7oNaa	*puts gun to head and pulls the trigger*|`|7DJkwzKDaa	I'm still happy I'm under 18 and am not pressured.<br>  Btw, Obama is cooler than your socks.|`|6zdmzdQ2aa	I'm not old enough to vote yet... but that doesn't mean I don't have an opinion.<br>  <br>  If the fact that he allegedly contradicts himself when speaking is the only complaint you have so far, then I'd say we're doing pretty well.  I'm going to take a leap here and say that you're a Republican who also voted for George Bush... we all know how well he was with public speaking.<br>  <br>  Secondly, if you feel the need to bring this up, then you are obviously trying really hard to criticize the man and find something negative to say about him!  He's president! If you voted for him or not it's about time you give him a chance... do you want to see America go down the tubes? Show a little support... you've got no other option for four more years!|`|3D3dQk9Laa	nope, i never voted for him in the first place (even if I could i vote at 15 i still wouldn't vote for him)|`|HuQVHaIgaa	Not really|`|1HnJXVSHaa	I never voted for him.|`|huSL5Fc1aa	did not vote.|`|D2C0OSenaa	i didn't vote but at least palins not in the white house.|`|hOpwE6XMaa	So you believe McCain would be better at speaking? Yeah, right.|`|WKfuWtvQaa	Yea I'm Happy <br>  My President Is Black :)

3WGU6Nvvaa	So far Metrolyrics.com has been good. But remember, random people send in these lyrics to the websites.|`|TW1TJWTfaa	I really like sing365... It's the most consistently accurate one I've found so far.|`|UzrtmZ4Vaa	I like plyrics.com which is mostly for punk/rock music. So far they've been the most reliable but when a band isn't on there I would try to go to elyrics.com or darklyrics. Also azlyrics.com is good but on my virus scan a big red x is next to it so I can't go on that one anymore. Just make sure you listen and read and then see for yourself if it sounds right.<br>  Um.... hope that helped, or just buy the album and then you know the lyrics in the booklet are right.|`|HojFJSyyaa	<a href="http://www.findsonglyrics.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.findsonglyrics.org</a>|`|AA11186382	www.lyricsmode.com

hP2nzb2haa	Go to the your nearest Resort/Hotel that is close to home... not only that rent a room... look for these things to celebrate with your dearest girlfriends it must have Spa treatment, Dinner, and Night Jazz Club/Bar. These things will make you feel special. Also go to "Party City" to get a birthday tiara... so you can feel like a princess!<br>  You and your girlfriends should get a spa treatment and later in the evening celebrate the dinner with your girlfriends, their boyfriends and your boyfriend or just make it all about girls. Start looking for a special package... since the economy is short-falling the Resort/Hotel will have a great deal to be offer... ask around as matter of fact speak to the manger to get a great deal (front-desk clerk don't make offer)... make them give you what you want... time is now.

2BpkXSnqaa	Violet = HIGHEST ELEMENT OF SPIRITUAL MASTERY<br>  Violet is the ray of spiritual mastery. It is the highest and most subtle specialization of light, being at the opposite end of the color spectrum to red.<br>  It should be viewed as both a completion as well as a beginning of the energy vibration beyond the visible color spectrum.<br>  Violet is a combination of both red and blue and this is key to understanding this color. It brings a stabilizing energy to the franticness of red. It lends practicality to the undirected spaciousness of blue.<br>      * darker tones are associated with sorrow<br>      * deep purple signifies high spiritual attainment<br>      * pale lilac brings love for humanity<br>      * bluish purple brings idealism<br>      * sparks the imagination and inspiration<br>      * integrates other energies for healing purposes <br>  <br>  Indigo = INFINITY<br>  Indigo amplifies the energy of blue in a profound way. At a physical level, while blue is calming, indigo is sedating. It deepens and turns blue energy inward.<br>  The indigo ray symbolizes the bridge between the finite and the infinite and opens the door to the mystical borderland.<br>  While blue energy is fast, Indigo energy is more often lightening fast.<br>      * opens the subconscious<br>      * spiritual attainment<br>      * self-mastery<br>      * wisdom<br>      * sudden awareness<br>      * intuition<br>      * psychic abilities <br>  <br>  Blue = SPIRITUALITY<br>  Blue is the color of distance - oceans, skies, the heavens. The energy of blue helps us to look beyond the immediate environment, expanding our perceptions towards the unknown.<br>  Blue is the color of Divinity. It brings:<br>      * Peace and understanding<br>      * Enhances the easy flow of communication with yourself or others<br>      * Calms and relaxes <br>  <br>  Green = LIFE, BALANCE, NATURE<br>  Green is the merging of yellow (mind) and blue (spirit). It is located exactly at the point of color balance - midway between red and violet on the color spectrum.<br>  The human eye is able to recognize more variation in the color green than in any other color.<br>  Its energy contains:<br>      * harmony<br>      * sympathy<br>      * health<br>      * abundance<br>      * balance<br>      * growth and expansion <br>  <br>  Yellow = WISDOM<br>  Yellow is naturally associated with the sun itself, and so with its life giving and sustaining energy.<br>  Yellow enriches, lightens and activates many of the systems of the body.

I am SO excited! :D Cristofer Drew is adorable and one of my favorite musicians ever!<br>  <br>  Most of the time they don't allow cameras because they think you are going to sell the photos for money, <br>  And they don't  want fans annoying other fans by using the flashes on their cameras.|`|JeR9DyJyaa	I wanna go but I don't think he's coming to my area. D:<br>  <br>  Have fun! :D|`|P4I2dCS5aa	Most likely to reserve the photography for paying publicists. Also, it might be an effort to prevent people posting videos on third party websites, costing them revenue.
BZEN8QXbaa	It is called a carton or boxed,and don't feel awkward about pointing to the ones you want,many people that live here their whole lives do it... And sometimes you just have to say the whole name..Also they have them in soft pack and boxed,that just means what the cigarettes come in...|`|STUJOkAraa	I would say, "I would like a pack of Marlboro Menthol Ultralights, please". If you buy only one package it is called a "pack". If you buy the large box (10 packs), it is called a "carton". Hope this helps!|`|xJqb88oAaa	Get a tat of your brand on your inner arm like my grandma did.|`|CMo0Fh1Zaa	oh yea, I want yellow teeth|`|S9bEtVCSaa	Carton of Marlb.

e4hkuXJlaa	I couldn't bear it..... unless they were friendly. If they weren't I would either ignore them, annoy them, or make a million dollars off becoming a ghost whisperer.

3Vo8aOpaaa	Well, he went out with Melissa first and they went golfing. Then, they meet up with Ty and golf with him, Ty and Melissa were getting along real well. Then, they went to his family's house and the family still had issues with the fact that Jason didn't get to meet her family. Then Jason and Molly went to the beach with Ty. Ty and Molly didn't click at first but it got better. Molly went to Jason's family's house and it seemed they liked her a little more. Jason started crying over the difficulty of picking two women he loved. The next day Melissa and Jason were supposed to go on a beautiful boat ride but it rained on them. They went back home and Mel told him that her parents wouldn't mind talking to him on the phone. The next day Molly planned a date for the couple. They went home and she gave him a massage and cooked him dinner. She gave him a book she made of all the past items on the bachelor. The next day he talked to Melissa's parents then Deanna came and was like "I made a mistake and blahblahblah" Well he just said thank you and escorted her out. Then it was time and he rejected Molly and the cried his eyes out. He gave Mel the ring and it was so romantic but little did we know that 6 weeks later he still was in love with Molly. So, he dumped her and she was angry and hurt. I didn't blame her. He asked to get Molly backed and she said yes. Now they are happy and Molly is moving to Seattle. We don't have any updates and Mel other than she doesn't regret anything.|`|uDsXjzwjaa	Jason went on dates with Molly and Melissa. Each girl got to spend time with Jason and Ty and then they met Jason's family. Melissa meshed with Ty right away, but Ty took a little while to warm up to Molly. After the last dates Jason got to talk to Melissa's parents on the phone since he didn't get to meet them in person. Later on Deanna showed up at his house and honestly I have no clue what the point of that was. I think it was just for ratings because she didn't really say much except that he should not pick the "wild" person that she did. He should pick the girl he could see himself with forever. She said she wished she would have picked him. In the end Jason picked Melissa and it was extremely romantic. They jumped in the pool together with their really nice clothes on and had Ty with them. Well then the after the rose show came on and Jason announced that he and Melissa had been talking and spending time together but his feelings just weren't there for her anymore. He said they had talked about it a little but she didn't know the extent of it. He broke up with her on the show and she was pissed (as she should be) but later in the limo when she was leaving she said that was a wall and she was actually really hurt. Well after that Jason met with Molly and told her what happened and said he couldnt' stop thinking about her and wanted to see if she would give him another chance. She said she would and that her feelings for him had not changed since he sent her home. They have since been dating and Molly is planning on moving to Seattle.|`|plpCtejoaa	i heard he picked melissa over molly then during the reunion he broke up with melissa and said he wanted another shot with molly and now they are trying it out....again?

iH4HMQEkaa	the studio recording is done over and over again until it's without blemish, and sometimes it's portions of the song all strung together into the finished peice. There is also "over dubbing" which is where the singers voice is recorded again over the top of themselves with a few milliseconds space between the timing. These are things that can't be done live.|`|SAaEiqHvaa	production of their tracks can make them sound better..|`|b77a399b601ebea9dfd2bbfd3203079caa	cause all those sound effect instrument they use in the studio is not on stage i know the feeling,lol|`|qP3kRBsAaa	because when they are in the studio they use a voice smoother and it works out all the kinks in there voice..

Hope he makes it.|`|GGAgxzJNaa	Everybody in it talked too fast.  I could barely understand what anyone was saying.  They need to slow down and enunciate.  The technical aspects of it were fine, but I have no idea what any of that was about.

ZzqWzFNiaa	I thought it was great. I thought Michael Keaton was a really great choice (I've never understood the contingent who thought it didn't work. he was much better than Kilmer and Clooney, even a much as I like Christian Bale I think Keaton was better), Nichoson hit it out of the park. Tim Burton is great, and had a really good thing going until Joel Shoemaker came by and ruined everything. You're also right. All the comic book movies that followed were made possible by the job that they did. Really great stuff, groundbreaking.<br>  <br>  That said, by your last sentence and it's obvious emphasis, it appears that this is more about discrediting the Christopher Nolan franchise, or at least claiming Burton's superiority. I cannot agree with you there. I feel like Christopher Nolan is replacing camp with some grit while not totally removing the charm of Batman being what it is. Neither is perfect. I feel like where Burton's movies could have been less campy, Nolan's love story angles feel too contrived. It seems to inevetibly feel like they are putting it in because they kind of have to. <br>  <br>  I like what Christopher Nolan is building though. I think he is bringing credibility back after Joel Shoemaker took a giant piss on the whole thing. I think Burton's Batman, and Burton in general is great, but I prefer Nolan's.|`|hQ95u9OLaa	The most overrated film of its era. It was supposed to revolutionize action movies; all it was was a weak script with lame action stunts in which a preening actor was allowed full reign, directed by a weirdo who for all the promise he showed in Beetlejuice has made one elaborate set piece after another.<br>  <br>  Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins is arguably the best comic book movie of all time (I personally think Spider Man 2 was better). Maybe The Dark Knight has its problems that people overlook because of Heath Ledger's death but it is miles above either of Burton's Batman movies.|`|Y4RS35M7aa	Tim Burton is a great director, but I'll always associate that BM movie with the "comic book' movies of the 80s and 90s like "Dick Tracy" "The Mask" and even "Howard the Duck" all of which were awful.  <br>  <br>  The casting of Jack Nicholson as Joker was quite a coup, though.  Who'd a thunk it?|`|tiGpryHiaa	I totally agree with you.  It was one of a kind... an original.  Tim Burton is a wonderful director and created an amazing story and the perfect movie.

czzJPoTraa	I did not bleed, but it does happen and it is normal.<br>  <br>  It depends on his size. Yes, it hurts a little. It also depends on if you ... "pleasure yourself."<br>  <br>  Yes, it is hard to get in. <br>  <br>  USE PROTECTION! :)|`|mB55rOTKaa	This is a question that many girls are afraid to ask, but it is good to know. To answer your questions:<br>  <br>  A majority of girls will bleed because their hymen will need to tear in order to fit a penis inside of it. An easier way to loosen up your hymen is to sit in a warm bath every now and then, locate your vaginal opening, and stretch the area with your fingers. Masturbation with toys, or even sports such as gymnastics or horseback riding could also cause your hymen to tear on it's own.<br>  <br>  For the most part, having sex for the first time will hurt, depending on the girl. Not everyone has the same experience. Having a trustworthy partner that is aware of the situation you are in could help during your first sexual experience. If you are too afraid that it will hurt, you probably should not go through with it.<br>  <br>  It may be difficult inserting a penis into a vagina throughout years to come even after your first sexual experience, but especially the first time. This is depending on the tearing of the hymen and how much lubrication is in the area. Many people find bottled lube to be useful in order to ease the insertion of the penis.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|cyt7oh97aa	1. you could a little, but probably won't too much<br>  2. because it's your first time, probably, mostly because you won't be relaxed as much, but if you relax you'll be fine<br>  3. it can be if you are very dry, and especially using a condom(which you should use.)  it will be a good idea to use some lubrication, it makes things a lot easier for everyone.<br>  <br>  another pointer, keep a towel nearby, and though this is weird, it's best for girls to go to the bathroom before and after intercourse so that no bacteria is pushed up your urethra and you get a urinary tract infection.  girls that begin sex tend to have them and that's why.|`|ihxO8qApaa	lmao, <br>  1.matters how 'big' the guy is, and how small you are. and how gentle he is<br>  <br>  2.matters  how 'big' the guy is and how 'small' you are and how gentle. but most likely its going to hurt<br>  <br>  3.um well, lol matters how 'big' the guy is and how 'small' you are|`|TYpgQYZPaa	Lol this is a funny question. When i lost mine i didn't bleed. I don't know if he was to small or what. I think I might have even lost it to a tampon before ^_^. so that may be why. The other answer is yes it does hurt. Ill be honest. And its not that hard to get it in as long as you are wet enough. Sorry i know I am being blunt but I wanted to answer truthfully.|`|1NP8RENraa	1. No you don't bleed, unless you're having your period during sexual intercourse.<br>  2. Depends on if you like pain in your vaginal area.<br>  3. Depends, are you using lubricant, and is there a condom involved.|`|GyJbVRuOaa	juist maybe spot ,yes the first time it hurts a little but every person is diff. not too hard to get it in with some one who knows what they are doing  (just make sure this is the one you want to lose it to|`|aNhvckHEaa	1.Some ppl do. <br>  2.It doesnt hurt if the guy knows what he's doing<br>  3.No. Thats the easiest part. Warm up the oven before you put the turkey in. lol|`|Fqvck2Mhaa	1: you do not bleed.<br>  2: it may hurt a little but the pleasure kinda covers up any pain.<br>  3: it may be a little hard because you have never had sex before.|`|PzxUeGDCaa	1 i did<br>  2 yes<br>  3 if he isnt experienced or your very ummm...*cough cough* tight...awkward|`|52b00ffdd9db9d1bc141025e4619289baa	My answer for each of those questions is "no"...from my own personal experience. Unfortunately, the first time also lasted about 30 seconds.|`|TwK1QsOIaa	1. yes.<br>  2. not really.<br>  3. didnt think so.|`|nRfaM3qGaa	yes to all three dear. those are all normal. if you have any other questions feel free to email me =) and be safe!! haha  -cam|`|BDVSOPL8aa	Omg!<br>  Yes <br>  Yes<br>  And omfg Yes|`|OvWdQ1c5aa	yes<br>  yes<br>  yes yes yes|`|itOkhYZaaa	i'm 20 and haven't had it yet...wait until you actually know.|`|BwMJ3Jlkaa	The way you worded everything sounds gross<br>  <br>  anyway<br>  16<br>  yes<br>  it didnt hurt but it wasn't a good feeling<br>  no|`|4sW8MFxCaa	i haven't<br>  1- yes<br>  2- yes<br>  3- not sure|`|go1jIgbwaa	You realize that there are sites which will tell you these things.<br>  Especially those "Just Wait" people. They will tell you all you need to know, and more.<br>  I wouldn't know, because I've never had sex, but from what my other friends tell me, it does hurt, and yes sometimes to number three, but none of them bled.|`|D8I3Brngaa	i took a girl's virginity.  it bled, it was hard to get in, and she said it hurt.|`|4MJEWCjiaa	1. Sometimes, a little bit<br>  2. Not really (usually you're just nervous)<br>  3. I'd advise some type of lubrication|`|C2sZREuAaa	yes<br>  yes<br>  and yes if your mate has a football|`|dAKgZr7Xaa	NOT "sick" or "embarrassing", think about it, its really quite natural to want to know.<br>  You MAY bleed a little, its not a big problem, however, if bleeding continues, you should see your doctor, preferably, or an outpatient service at a local hospital, ask for a female to do the checkup.<br>  It MAY hurt a bit, that is also natural, but it WILL hurt more if you are tense, and or not ready to do "it" (make love mon cherie).<br>  It may be difficult to insert the penis into the vagina if your man is well endowed, be sure to check, and go with someone around your own age, you don't want some big bull as the first.<br>  I would suggest you begin by using digit(s) [finger] to work on the problem, it could take a few attempts, with LOTS of foreplay over a period of weeks to prepare.<br>  Your body, your first, your rarest experience, DO NOT THROW IT AWAY!  Make it special, and in YOUR OWN TIME, no pressure, that contributes to tension.<br>  Using a condom is advisable, but will make it more difficult, you should use an appropriate lubricant, like KY. Never use vaseline, or any other petroleum based "grease" as these MAY cause cerviical cancer etc.<br>  A lad with some experience but not too big SHOULD be able to control ejaculation, we are not talking about coitus interuptus, but CONTROL, eg: i can control it for HOURS, no joke. <br>  Not a brag, fact. (someone answered "~ 30 seconds ~", poor thing!)<br>  Another trick is to "do him" prior, then spend the next 5 to 15 minutes recharging him up again, while you go through a few "O" (oh,oh,oh,yes,yes,ohyes,ohyes,OMG YESSSS) cycles, [I.Y.K.W.I..M] if possible, with his help.|`|3zxVzPBxaa	1.- no<br>  2.- no<br>  3.- no<br>  <br>  everyones different of course, but i didnt have any problems.. just make sure you are nice and lubricated!!|`|NlXWdRcQaa	Shoulda asked this in woman's health hun.<br>  Not in Polls & Surveys...<br>  <br>  I'm still a virgin but I know people that have lost it.<br>  <br>  1) Yes.<br>  2) At first.<br>  3) First time, yes.|`|SetM2gxRaa	I'm just saying DON'T, these new generation little fvckface gay looklikes make everyone sick.|`|FBywNyw8aa	1. yes<br>  2. not rlly<br>  3. sorta xD|`|JRRsjByCaa	no<br>  yes<br>  yes|`|Jph6y9viaa	only number one but|`|uMV6jwZnaa	yes<br>  yes <br>  and idk<br>  ive never done "it" but its just wat ive heard

d81b30c00cb504557913a5cdae3a39afaa	The show is broken into fofive set. So the songs fit into the category. I don't know the order. But i can give you the songs and the sets.<br>  <br>  First Set - 1964 Ed Sullivan Show<br>  <br>  The first set is an astonishing recreation of the Beatles stage set from the 1964 Ed Sullivan show, with the band dressed in the authentic Saville Row custom tailored suits, Beatle boots, and donning hair styles to match the likenesses of John, Paul, George and Ringo. The set, combined with black and white camera work instantly takes you back in time to that historic first night that the Beatles appeared on American television.<br>  <br>  Second Set - Shea Stadium<br>  <br>  After a brief interlude of songs from their movie era featuring selections from "A Hard Days Night", the band is suddenly transported to Shea Stadium via helicopter where nearly 56,000 fans witness the group's highest attended concert to date. Live video technology provides views of the band through close- ups and different angles, as members of the audience are projected onto the main screens for a completely interactive experience.<br>  <br>  Third Set - Sgt. Pepper Era<br>  <br>  The third set features the music and colorful costumes of the "Sgt. Pepper" era. Behind the band, a huge backdrop of the Sgt. Pepper album cover is shown. Or so it seems. Upon closer inspection, you'll see that the band has cleverly interspersed their own photos to completely re-create the famous album cover. With the use of sophisticated sound and lighting, audiences will experience the music, energy and excitement of seeing the Beatles live in concert - something that the Beatles themselves never did during this period.<br>  <br>  In fact, the Beatles stopped touring after 1966 and never performed the music of Sgt. Pepper live.<br>  <br>  Fourth Set - Flower Power<br>  <br>  After a quick intermission, the fourth set opens to the strains of Indian music where a brief description of the "Summer of Love" and the group's new-found interest in meditation transports us back to that memorable time. The curtain opens to reveal the band attired in costumes reminiscent of the flower power era, as they perform the music of the years 1967-68. Of special note here is the performance of an acoustic set, revealing to the audience what the Beatles' actual song writing processes may have been like.<br>  <br>  Fifth Set - Abbey Road<br>  <br>  The Abbey Road period brings the show to its fifth set. A re-creation of the famous "Abbey Road" album cover provides the backdrop, while stage props such as the doorway to EMI studios add to the visual effects that accurately reflect this period. The transformation to this era is complete with yet another costume change, reflecting the style of the Beatles during 1969-70. The visual effect is such that you think the band has stepped out of the album cover. The music within this set includes selections from the "Golden Slumbers" medley through "The End" -- the Beatles' swan song of their short but magnificent career.<br>  <br>  Song List<br>  [Not in order]<br>  <br>   <br>  Act Naturally<br>  All I've Got To Do<br>  All My Loving<br>  All You Need Is Love<br>  And I Love Her<br>  And Your Bird Can Sing<br>  Anna<br>  Another Girl<br>  Anytime At All<br>  Baby's In Black<br>  Back In The Ussr<br>  Ballad Of John And Yoko<br>  Because<br>  Birthday<br>  Blackbird<br>  Can't Buy Me Love<br>  Carry That Weight<br>  Come Together<br>  Day In The Life<br>  Day Tripper<br>  Dear Prudence<br>  Devil In Her Heart<br>  Do You Want To Know A Secret<br>  Don't Let Me Down<br>  Drive My Car<br>  Eight Days A Week<br>  Eleanor Rigby<br>  Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby<br>  Fixing A Hole<br>  Fool On The Hill<br>  Free As A Bird<br>  From Me To You<br>  Get Back<br>  Getting Better<br>  Girl<br>  Glass Onion<br>  Golden Slumbers<br>  Good Day Sunshine<br>  Good Morning Good Morning<br>  Got To Get You Into My Life<br>  Happy Just To Dance With You<br>  Hard Days Night<br>  Hello Goodbye<br>  Help<br>  Helter Skelter<br>  Here Comes The Sun<br>  Hey Bulldog<br>     Hey Jude<br>  Honey Don't<br>  Honey Pie<br>  I Am The Walrus<br>  I Call Your Name<br>  I Dig A Pony<br>  I Feel Fine<br>  I Need You<br>  I Saw Her Standing There<br>  I Should Have Known Better<br>  I Want To Hold Your Hand<br>  I Will<br>  I'll Cry Instead<br>  I'm Looking Through You<br>  I'm So Tired<br>  I've Just Seen A Face<br>  If I Fell<br>  If I Needed Someone<br>  I'll Be Back<br>  I'll Follow The Sun<br>  I'll Get You<br>  I'm A Loser<br>  I'm Down<br>  Imagine<br>  In My Life<br>  It Wont Be Long<br>  Its Only Love<br>  I've Got A Feeling<br>  Julia<br>  Lady Madonna<br>  Let It Be<br>  Live And Let Die<br>  Long And Winding Road<br>  Love Me Do<br>  Lovely Rita<br>  Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds<br>  Magical Mystery Tour<br>  Martha My Dear<br>  Maxwell's Silver Hammer<br>  Mean Mr. Mustard<br>  Michelle<br>  Misery<br>  Money<br>  Mother Nature Son<br>  No Reply<br>  Norwegian Wood<br>  Not A Second Time<br>  Nowhere Man<br>     Ob-la-di, Ob-la-da<br>  Octopuses Garden<br>  One After 909<br>  P.S.

gp7qmHsMaa	Yes that is correct. After all eight contestants perform, the judges will pick the three they think deserve to be in the Top 12. Once done, the Top 12 will be complete.<br>  <br>  yeah, mt. of ninja dragons I too thought that there was going to be 12 in the wild card round. It is indeed confusing.|`|vryw9udtaa	yeah, i guess the judges are gonna pick the three tomorrow. i thought 12 were gonna get into the wild card round, though. guess not. it's kinda confusing, isn't it? and i was wondering about that too. how could they prepare a song in one day? probably they had all of them prepare a song just in case they were chosen.|`|6S8KjBLQaa	Yes, and knowing them they'll pick the wrong people, um ignoring Ann Marie!? That's why they should all be fired! They pick 3 (I'm guessing they'll all be girls because we have 3 girls and all 6 men in the top 12, why wouldn't they put KENDALL in tonight seeing it would be almost even with 5 men. and 4 girls..idol perplexes me)<br>  :)|`|aihogb26aa	As I understand it, the judges will pick the final 3 on the spot after everyone has performed. Then we will have our official top 12 and the top 12 compete next week.
FE1jyfRSaa	A bus carrying only ugly people crashes into an oncoming truck, and everyone inside dies.<br>  <br>  They then get to meet their maker and because of the grief they have experienced; he decides to grant them one wish each, before they enter Paradise.<br>  <br>  They're all lined up, and God asks the first one what the wish is. "I want to be gorgeous," and so God snaps His fingers, and it is done.<br>  <br>  The second one in line hears this and says "I want to be gorgeous too." Another snap of His fingers and the wish is granted.<br>  <br>  This goes on for a while with each one asking to be gorgeous but when God is halfway down the line the last guy in the line starts laughing.<br>  <br>  When there are only ten people left, this guy is rolling on the floor, laughing his head off.<br>  <br>  Finally, God reaches this last guy and asks him what his wish will be. The guy eventually calms down and says:<br>  <br>  "Make 'em all ugly again".|`|lMbKZ1VUaa	Knock Knock<br>  Who's there?<br>  F<br>  F who?<br>  F you!|`|gbXcF8PZaa	This one is pretty funny:<br>  There are three men working on a roof one is white one is japanese and one is mexican. The guys sit down on the roof and open their lunches. The japanese man says oh damn sushi again! if i get sushi one more time for lunch im going to jump off the roof. The mexican man opens his lunch and says god tamales again if i get them one more time im going to jump off the roof. Then the white blonde man opens his lunch and say no! a baloni sand witch again if i get one more im going to jump off this roof! so the next day comes and the men open their lunches. The japanese man opens is lunch and says damn and jumps off the roof. The mexican man opens his lunch and say god and jumps off the roof. Then the white guy opens his lunch and jumps off the roof.

AA10625467	I honestly do not know. I guess it has to do with timing. But I'm pretty sure people from before were like "Why do people like Elvis, The Beatles, Disco, Michael Jackson, *N'Sync?" etc. So it's probably timing.|`|bmwR7RdMaa	they have nothing else useful to do<br>   I hate miley and jonas|`|aAj4dSyuaa	I ask myself the same question.

Those are 2 companies that have beauticians who can look at your skin & eyes & hair color & tell you which colors are more flattering for you and what color makeup would be best..  They both said the same thing, that I have warm colored skin & look best in autumn colors.  <br>  <br>  The author of the Color Me Beautiful book just came out with a new edition of her book last year.  I saw it on sale on a rack at Safeway, & picked up a copy just for fun, even though I already know the scoop.<br>  <br>  The whole thing makes your clothing choices much easier & faster, & it doesn't matter if you're having something custom-made or if you're shopping at Macy's or Kolhs or Salvation Army or wherever.  It just makes it faster to grab things & to know what to try on.  <br>  <br>  So, for the pj's, for me it could be a turquoise blue or maybe navy blue or many different greens or maybe a yellow or cream.  For you, I don't know.|`|N6DTRMMMaa	Blue. It's a sleepy color.

hP2nzb2haa	Safari Hat as a centerpiece(s),  get it at 'Party City' or order it from <a href="http://www.target.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.target.com</a> or <a href="http://www.birthdayinabox.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.birthdayinabox.com</a><br>  'Birthday in a Box' - it's selling it for $1.97 ea. <br>  Anyway, get a safari hat, turn it upside down, put it on top of small clear bowl (the hat is not flat to stand still on the table), inside the hat put in a tea light candle, now around the hat and to cover the clear bowl get a moss grass, spread the moss grass around on the table next to the bowl/hat, now get safari/jungle big leaf around on the moss and on the table. The moss grass and the safari/jungle big leaves can be found at any craft stores (Michael's and Walmart). The leaves come in group, so you have to cut it part to make it in single pieces and spread around on the table. Be creative and have fun. I hope this help. Also try Oriental Trading Company: <a href="http://www.orientaltrading.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.orientaltrading.com</a> ... it have tons of cool stuffs.<br>  For plates/stuffs... check out Party City, Oriental Trading Company and/or Birthday in a Box.

Personally I think hurricanes are cool, I ran outside during one. But when one like Katrina hits, it really sucks when it ruins your house. But earthquakes do a lot more harm. They never really get tooo big, except for the loma prieta, that was horrible and i would take a hurricane any day before experiencing that.|`|a4LWildhaa	Earthquake-no comparison.

In human life TEAM JACOB i think that he is suppost to be her soul mate, although i also believe has human jacob may have loved her a little bit more to give her up to edward instead of continuing fighting for her it showed he ddnt what to see her hurt, this is my opinion if she were to stay human but as a vampire TEAM EDWARD ALL THE WAY.  Thats just for bella though,  For me Id have to say TEAM EDWARD, i say this only because he is just the type of old fashion guy every girl wants to meet someone who will put their life out for you, all they want to do is make you happy, and will LOVE you no matter what happens.|`|INev6aIkaa	book: edward, because he is really hot in my imagination and i just love the way he loves bella it gets creepy at times but at times i wish i had someone like that<br>  movie: jacob because taylor looks closer to my age and he looks better than rob ( don't kill me my opinion)LOL|`|4q4Jalvzaa	TEAM EDWARD!! bella can have edward and i will take Jacob. lol<br>  <br>  AND TO ALL YOU TWILIGHT HATERS YOU CAN SUCK BA**S BECAUSE TWILIGHT<br>  RULES|`|Lth6XBeIaa	Definately Edward.<br>  True love over bestfriend. =D lol|`|J0G4lRrNaa	Edward!|`|SLL66Avnaa	jACOB !

5LxpvXSmaa	i just wish he was more tactful and less cold. i do not care if  ABC had it arranged he would do it on national TV he is man and he should have said no. He said he knew how it felt when Deanna chose Jesse well i think this hurt 100x worse and that fact he left hugging and cooing with Molly was another slap in the face for Melissa. <br>  He went with his heart and we cannot penalize him for that but we can and are holding it against him the way he did it. So callous and cold to break someones heart on national TV.|`|YP2xuZdtaa	mabe|`|1cJjGNOBaa	it has now come out that when he told producers that he was breaking up with Melissa and asking Molly for another chance they "made" him do it on-air. I would have told them "no way". I think it was class-less and shows that he's just another M-A-N (jerk) instead of the sweet, close to perfect guy we thought he was. Melissa was so right- when you ask someone to marry them, it should be forever and for real and he didn't even give it a chance. He should have sent her home and chosen Molly to begin with OR not choosing either one that night like one or two others had done in the past.|`|LvywvZSeaa	Only he knows that...it's his life, and his feelings. I really liked Jason until he did that. I think that if that was how he felt, fine. But don't do it on national TV, and don't act like such a pig. (Shedding a tear over Melissa, then making out with molly)

nwi5ZHk0aa	I read on wikipedia.com that a second season had been planned, but then postponed because of the upcoming season of American Idol. And then the idea was abandoned altogether and all the focus went back to American Idol. I guess the producers or whoever was in charge decided that all of their time and attention would be put to better use on American Idol. And you can auditon for American Idol when you turn 16. But if you don't want to wait that long, you can always audition for America's Got Talent. That show has no age limit and was created by Simon Cowell. In fact, the winner of the debut season of the show was only 11 years old and was a singer (Bianca Ryan).|`|6S8KjBLQaa	LOL One step closer to heaven, haha I loved that show.

AA10065812	???<br>  I just got back from the theater.  Now I'm 53, and I liked it, but my 30 year old daughter didn't.  She got bored with much of it, which was good because than she went to refill the drinks and popcorn.<br>  <br>  In a personal sense, I would not recommend this for teens, but so many (not all) teens have received little moral teaching from their parents, so it may not matter.<br>  <br>  You see a lot of Dr. Manhattan's pecker, which did catch my daughter's attention, repeatedly.  Her boyfriend better run for the hills when she gets home or he may never survive.<br>  <br>  Many in the audience missed the subtle things, especially the teenagers, such as the blood blotch in the snow and its double meaning. Us old farts caught it right away.|`|AA12108244	It's up to you, but despite it's mixed reviews Watchmen is more critically well-received than all of the movies you just named.|`|LBovv7Sxaa	watchmen will be amazing.<br>  <br>  the book is one of the best books ive ever ready (seriously!).<br>  <br>  all those other movies are complete rubbish.|`|7BkkZo9Kaa	Watchmen<br>  <br>  It is not your old superhero story|`|Z3W8t5QJaa	YOU SHOULD SEE WATCHMEN!!!

The story is absolutely amazing. Its set in the 1980's, when Nixon is president, and really goes into detail the hardships about being a superhero. Also, the heroes aren't exactly the kind and gentle souls that cartoons make them out to be. But if you don't like it, see He's Just Not That Into You. Looks hilarious!

YFBdXkDHaa	That is episode 3:14 -All Tomorrow Parties<br>  <br>  Peyton and Haley team up with Brooke in a trifecta road trip to NYC for the fashion experience of a lifetime. They're confident that they will have no problem taking the Big Apple by storm and then hopping a plane nine hours later to get to the Charlotte for the cheer competition. Brooke is pleased that Rachel is going to hate her success and Peyton is pleased that she is really living life the way Ellie would have liked.<br>  Meanwhile, Whitey is running a tight ship on the team bus to Charlotte. Rules will be rules this year and that also goes for the chaperones, Karen and Keith, who can't stop making out in the back of the bus. And once in Charlotte, Rachel turns extremely bossy, with her own strict rules and that doesn't sit so well with the rest of the gals.<br>  Once they get to NYC, Roguevogue Brooke discovers that a change has been made. Her clothes don't show until the second day. Looks like she has a choice to make. She decides to stay, but sends the girls off to Charlotte. Later, it's crazy at the show but Brooke manages to locate her model, Solaris. She's fifteen but looks much older and Solaris decides that she's going to take Miss Brooke out on the town that night. Brooke, naturally, is game. But that night when Solaris does some serious drugs in the VIP room, Brooke quickly realizes that she's swimming in the deep end -- and the folks in the fashion world are the sharks.<br>  Keith has a romantic room all set up to share with Karen, complete with champagne and all. But then Whitey barges in and announces that he'll be rooming with Keith -- they don't want to be a bad influence on the kids. Later, during what was supposed to be a romantic dinner for two, Whitey barges in again to invite Keith on a bowling date. The good guy that he is, Keith agrees to hang with the old guy.<br>  Nathan's friend Tony from High Flyers arrives at the hotel and convinces Nathan and Lucas to head out for a wild night. Their wild night turns out to be an evening with his family, as well as a home-cooked dinner, and an enlightening talk with Tony's father. Pops could have played pro ball, but instead he had a family -- and that's just fine with him. After all, regret makes you old and bitterness poisons the people around you. Too bad Dan wasn't at that dinner -- he could have learned a lot. But the lessons weren't lost on the Scott brothers.<br>  As soon as she arrives in Charlotte, Rachel tells her that she's not much of a listener but she does have tequila in her room. Peyton thinks that sounds like a plan. While in the room, Bevan calls Rachel to tell her that there has been a change of rooms. Now Haley is sleeping with her, and by all means don't let Peyton go to her original room -- Lucas is there now. Rachel knows the past that Peyton and Lucas share, and she doesn't bother to mention the room change to her drinking buddy.<br>  Peyton ends up getting really drunk with Rachel, who walks her to her room and tells her to "enjoy." Peyton staggers in the room and slips into bed with Lucas who assures his friend that everything is going to be all right. They wake up in the morning and Lucas informs Peyton that she was drunk enough to throw up six times the night before. Obviously, nothing romantic happened.<br>  Haley surprises Nathan in his room with candles and a bubble bath. The next morning Haley wants to order room service but Nathan wants to have a proper sit-down breakfast somewhere -- family-style. Haley agrees wholeheartedly.<br>  After she flees the club, Brooke gets brilliant advice from an insightful cabbie -- off the meter of course. He tells her that she has a long life and she should try to start making it great right now. Brooke decides be seventeen with her friends. She leaves the show and gives up a possible apprenticeship with Donna Karan and her own label to fly to Charlotte. As soon as she gets to the hotel, she discovers Lucas and Peyton in bed together and immediately thinks the worst. Lucas chases Brooke down the hall and explains that nothing happened -- he slept on the floor. He also reminds her that they're supposed to be trusting each other, and Peyton really needs both of them now.<br>  When the cheer team gets together for the competition, Peyton lays into Rachel for trying to be devious and they're all happily surprised to see Brooke. Well, everyone but Rachel is happy to see her. At the competition, Rachel is all business -- she wants to win the trophy. But Brooke tells the girls to have fun. On stage the routine is a disaster. Totally hung over, Peyton can't seem to keep up. And when she falls and causes others to fall with her, Brooke leads the team in a playful, joking dance to round out the routine. Even The Ravens join them on stage. Everyone has a ball -- except for Rachel who stands backstage, bitter.<br>  Meanwhile, Keith and Karen cuddle in the audience. And in a moment of spontaneity, Karen proposes to him. He tells her she can't propose to him -- he was going to ask he|`|435151e284df12d4815bc07669b643b3aa	im pretty sure its season three but to be absolutly sure u can go to google and type in one tree hill episode guide and look it up but im pretty sure its season three
jVZQR4XZaa	Yes all the Pisces I know aren't very outgoing. They are the type to live in the fantasies in their head, but I think that's awesome.

But it sounds to me like the thing that bothers you most is the actual name of the band, like it's some sort of subliminal message.  Don't buy into that garbage.  I say you should count your blessings for a few reasons.<br>  <br>  1. As I Lay Dying was nominated for a Grammy, so that at least gives them a shred of artistic credence.<br>  <br>  2. Since AILD is God-rock, I highly doubt they would be preaching suicide.<br>  <br>  3. You didn't find Fall Out Boy, Panic at the Disco or Nickelback on his computer (so I hope).|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	I was listening to Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath by the age of 11 and I am a productive member of society, college graduate with honors, an awesome friend (so I'm told), and a Christian.  My Mom let me have some freedom when it came to music as long as I did stuff around the house and was nice to her.  She is 80 now!  Relax.  Music was and still is a great outlet for me.|`|12QJ9QMRaa	Did you r parents like the music you listened to?<br>  <br>  Probably not.  How did you turn out?  Did they have any precoonceptions about it that were dead wrong?<br>  Screaming and heavy drums doesn't make bad music, as that is exactly what bands liek Led Zeppelin were accused of 30+ years ago.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should take the time to read some of the lyrics to his music, before you judge them?  If you come across bands that are promoting hatred or racism or the like, yeah, you might have a problem.<br>  <br>  As I lay Dying is actually  a pretty good band.  And actually, most Heavy Metal is NOT about violence, or Satanism or the like.  Most of it is actually about cvery mundane things, just set to LOUD music.<br>  <br>  I am 33, and listen to all sorts of music, and while you do need to be careful about some stuff out there (or more accurately, need to watch just how strongly your son takes the message certain bands preach to heart), for the most part music is what it always has been, just a way for a generation to express themselves.<br>  <br>  Is it more extreme today than when you were 16?  Certainly.  But then again, when you look at the world around us today, I would say that so are the crisis we are being left to deal with.|`|auFmP7J1aa	hey!<br>  <br>  i know you're concerned, but As I Lay Dying<br>  is actually christian.<br>  <br>  so unless you are against christianity, i don't<br>  think you should worry about it.<br>  <br>  the lyrics are really good too, deep meanings.<br>  <br>  plus, they said in an interview that their<br>  name doesn't really mean anything.<br>  <br>  =D<br>  <br>  hope that helps.|`|ebxwADDcaa	do some f*cking research. As I Lay Dying is a religious band.<br>  <br>  in my opinion, as long he isnt actually going crazy and killing people like ignorant people assume all metalheads do, he should be fine.|`|4bc3ee931fca2067bef8aafb614f2089aa	There's nothing to do, but except that he doesn't like what you like or prefer.<br>  You can take away his songs but that's not doing to stop him from listening to the music in the slightest bit, it will probably enhance it.|`|LwqM7EHVaa	There is nothing better than letting your son be himself..|`|AA10349376	You can't really do anything about it, sorry. You can try to get him to focus more on classic rock-metal type music. It's a lot better and not as heavy or emo-sounding. AC/DC, KISS, Led Zeppelin just to name a few. You can find some good classic rock songs on video games like Guitar Hero or Rock Band.|`|2c9e27b528ec302c442a3ff42014807daa	You should be thankful that he's not listening to Rap!|`|zfadjiJVaa	Let him be that stuff rocks.|`|6dDurRq0aa	you should let him listen to whatever music he wants|`|YNU2rRiVaa	let him listen to whatever he wants..|`|SMVsmzi4aa	well, what do u want him to listen to? the jonas brothers? ahh, god.|`|FJPKtZN5aa	look i release my feelings by listening to music and it cheers me up to listen to it to...he's just doing the same|`|rjeqfoKNaa	You'd HATE what I listen to. At least As I Lay Dying are Christians and don't have lyrics talking about killing cops, politicians and the rich, all the while engaging in serious amounts of blasphemy, like my music does. <br>  <br>  Bands with names like:<br>  Severed Head of State<br>  Assuck<br>  Behead the Prophet, No Lord Shall Live<br>  Cop on Fire<br>  Millions of Dead Cops<br>  Anti-Christ Demon Core<br>  The Crucifucks<br>  Dead Prez<br>  Extinction of Mankind<br>  Hellbastard<br>  Christian Death<br>  Limp Wrist<br>  Nausea<br>  Pig Destroyer (pig is slang for cop don't you know?)<br>  Pisschrist<br>  Unholy Grave<br>  <br>  Your son's music is tame. Oh, and seriously, you need to lay off. He's 16. He should be able to choose his own music without you caring about something as insignificant as a name like "As I Lay Dying" and having heavy drums. So what? He'll probably grow out of it eventually anyways, and you trying to stop him is only going to piss him off more and make him listen to more extreme stuff (trust me, I know from experience).|`|4a7701071ad590528cb7c90f82d61704aa	Despite the name As I Lay Dying are a Christian band, the name comes from a story by William Faulkner. Some sample lyrics<br>  "All that is hope within destruction, comes from you for I have fallen"-Within Destruction"<br>  "These thoughts they carry me, through the darkest nights, while your eyes rest in,"- The Darkest Nights<br>  That said I have the opposite thing going, I love this band and my teenage step- kids hate it(go figure). There's no cursing on their Cd's, in fact their live shows are clean as well. They're also one of the few bands that have played both Ozzfest and the Cornerstone Christian Music Festival. Trust me there things that you kid could be listening to than AILD.|`|k786qkJJaa	You cant Judge a Band by it's cover, Just like how you cant Judge a book.

[=|`|jA1ukKSHaa	It's all good =) <br>  <br>  He has a great taste in music.<br>  <br>  The Reason you don't like it is because you need to "Tip-Toe" into heavy metal.

As I Lay Dieing is just a stage name so don't worry about it.|`|oI1Vox4paa	well he is 16 and hopefully he will outgrow the band and find more mature metal bands.  Of course, they are a christian metalcore band, he may still find christian metal bands.  If I were you, support his music and do some research on heavy metal.  You're sure to find many bands that can actually play their instruments!|`|nLztiahAaa	Just because you cant understand what they are saying and are using fast pace instruments doesn't mean its not music. As I Lay Dying are all christians so there lyrics mean something. kids can relate to what the singer is talking about.

My parents have mostly been tolerant of my musical exploration. Naturally, it's within your rights as a parent to ban CDs from him, but this would probably just anger and alienate most teenage boys. My only advice, as a teenager myself (18), would be to have a frank but compassionate conversation in which you outline the qualities of the music that you'd want him to pursue. Stick to the positives, not the negatives.<br>  <br>  By the way, As I Lay Dying is sort of a "Christian" band. "Sort of" because religious themes are not prominent in their music, but as I understand, all the band members identify themselves Christians. See FAQ below. Christian bands are surprisingly prominent in today's "metalcore" scene. The title "As I Lay Dying" is from a William Faulkner novel, I believe.<br>  <br>  If you're concerned about the aesthetic qualities of As I Lay Dying and related bands, well, similar to the above....if you'd like him to listen to something else, I'd say try to crack his mind open to new musical ideas. Don't just say, "your favorite music is bad because it's all just screaming," because (1) we teenage boys tend to take such words as a challenge, (2) it's really not true, because all music is, at the same time, "just noise" and also an expression of human spirit. I think you'd be better off with an approach more like, "Hey, I was really enjoying listening to a CD of Felix Mendelssohn concertos for cello and piano [for example]. It's amazing how skilled and passionate those musicians are. Maybe you'd like it."<br>  <br>  By the way, ironically enough, As I Lay Dying tends to get mocked by serious metal fans for being too commercial, too shallow, and just not..."metal" enough.|`|rQcUK5Nhaa	All I can say is that you are fitting the stereotypical "metal/ rock is evil" parent.  I have been listening to metal since 6th grade, and I am probably the biggest hippie I know.<br>  <br>  About metal?  It's awesome.  And if your going to start bashing it and taking away your son's music, check this out:<br>  <br>  Think metal is bad?  Watch the Saw movies.  In one of them, a guy gets his hand chained to on of his ribs, and if he doesn't rip his rib out and get a key out of a vat filled with acid, he's going to die.  Hmmm.  I don't know about you, but that sounds absolutely sick to me.  But the people who watch these movies (I believe there are 5 of them) are totally "normal", no one thinks of them as evil or weird, yet they enjoy watching someone tortured...<br>  <br>  Metal is, to put it simply, music.  And the amount of misunderstanding that plagues people who listen to it is pathetic.  No one stops to look at all of the things right in front of them that society deems "ok" and "normal" that are totally disgusting.  Look at all of the popular music nowadays, for example.  Would you rather have him listen to that?  Check out THOSE songs lyrics before you compare anything to metal.  Sex and drugs I all I see in it.  Yet it is deep music such as metal and rock that is discriminated against.<br>  <br>  So my advice is do nothing, your son is totally normal if not more normal that the rest of society, you should be proud.

We couldn't wait to watch Lost and after barely arriving on time to watch lost (7:59) We were so disappointed to find out that the screen had frozen with that stupid wheel of fortune screen. <br>  <br>  We tried to figure it out but couldn't do it. Then after a couple of seconds I came to the realization... maybe if we figure out the puzzle then LOST will finally come on. Two minutes later I found the answer on here AND BAM!! Lost is back on and guess what the time on the clock was:.... 8:15.<br>  <br>  Anyways, good story and all but we couldn't watch lost starting from the middle, so we're gonna end up watching it online, damn,|`|B2aduw3maa	My mom and I have also been sitting here staring at the frozen wheel of fortune screen waiting for lost, hahaha.... not knowing the answer was driving us crazy, too! :)|`|C9C8O8HIaa	What's killing me is why they started in the middle of LOST.  Now everyone has missed the beginning.  What's up with that?

Z2EzfQFvaa	Death Note for sure.Code Geass sucks.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	In terms of action, Code Geass<br>  <br>  In terms of psychology, Death Note<br>  <br>  They both rule in plot and storyline.|`|4qVWj3UHaa	i am a fan of both, but i Like death note more.|`|2vUOqAikaa	Code Geas is better (In my opinion) by a mile. Lelouch plans were far wiser and he used his evils to achieve an end that benefited the entire planet. Light attempted to use his evils (He wouldn't call them evils.) to an egotistical end. Light wanted to become the ruler of a new world. He didn't achieve his desired outcome. Lelouch however, became the ruler of the planet, but for the sake of stability, peace, and equality he choose to forsake his kingship. Action wise, Code Geass also takes the crown.|`|KSC02NcLaa	Code Geass.  Death Note drags on & on after episode 19.   Code Geass is Thankfully Original the Whole Series.|`|1lkxpqAIaa	Death Note ^ ^|`|sOzkTuqjaa	I have never heard of code geass, but I have heard of death note and watched a little bit, and I think it is really amazing.  I've seen merchandise, I've seen someone dress up as L, people like the show a lot and it is very interesting.  Also there was this one news story about someone trying to pose as L and murdered someone, or it was a leg or something. Anyway, its affected a lot of people.|`|AhUDXqn4aa	I personally like both series, but I think I prefer Code Geass. Lelouch is spiffeh cuz he doesn't sit on his butt all day and write names. he actually kills people by hand/gun/geass(you get the point).<br>  <br>  though the people in code geass look like someone squished them through a tube, i mean, look how tall/skinny they are! 0.0|`|pzkw5LJ7aa	code geass by far!! not saying however that death note sucked..it was also a favorite of mine, but code geass doesn't seem to drag on as much as death note did. Plus i love the drawing style of code geass as well, but im a huge fan of clamp. so definitely code geass|`|TZ7PAUBIaa	I think its all really preference and opinion, but I actually liked both of them.|`|IFXdE0z0aa	Code Geass 100%|`|Qtgrx3Ywaa	Death Note.  <br>  <br>  I'm not a fan of the story or the animation in Code Geass|`|X3dfHBGGaa	I don't know,code geass maybe.The story is much brighter|`|AA12183014	code geass death notes ending sucked

R2RoNcLUaa	Lil Wayne FTW <br>  Personally I just like the way Wayne's lyrics degrade women and how all of his songs have no meaning whatsoever. Also Lupe is a master lyricist and how can I like someone who actually has flow and meaning? Kids today are stupid. They don't realize that fake raspy voices are what make good music! Well all in all I've gotta say that wayne's meaningless lyrics and awful flow are just more preferrable in my eyes|`|4hiMgHMCaa	Lupe fiasco|`|6c7e9e289fd5db36cd934c29dca6003eaa	Wow.  You don't think Lil Wayne is talented at all?  That's kind of a ridiculous statement.  Even if you don't like him as an artist you can't say he has no talent.  Look at his track record and how many of his peers in the business get him on their songs to make them good.  If he had no talent he wouldn't be rapping anymore trust me.  Oh and Lil Wayne is easily better than Lupe.  I can't stand Lupe's delivery and flow.|`|4fc9aa87352e3e2f25ca35455cdfb596aa	Lupe Fiasco<br>  Lupe and Lil Wayne aren't even in the same category. Yes Lil Wayne sells more albums than Lupe and is good in the commercial world, but Lupe still is better. Lupe is a lyricist( may not be a real world). The first song I loved from Lupe was kick,push(as a fellow skateboarder). Lil Wayne doesn't even rap to me. It makes me wonder how he has soo many fans and why some girls even find him attractive.|`|I2HgAwvsaa	lil wayne, i just like his music a lot better. and i don't even care that it doesn't make sense, that adds to his appeal.|`|Xf8Z6rJfaa	Lupe Fiasco<br>  <br>  He's so underrated..|`|632BbbUtaa	lupe. i dont like him that much but i hate lil wayne.|`|pd6SaHBOaa	I pick Lil' Wayne. He is "better" at getting money.<br>  Lupe is "better" at making more meaningful songs. I'm sure when he catches on to the amount of money he can make producting club songs, he''ll drop that "meaning" in a heartbeat.|`|OWeeohdSaa	Are you kidding me right now?  Lil Wayne has nothing no Lupe.  Lil Wayne had commercial success. That doesn't mean it was good. Lupe for sure. WTF. I'm gonna just stop. Damn it you Lil Wayners piss me off.|`|rXMrlilAaa	lupe embarrasses wayne. like, wayne is a good showman and everything, but lupe is just on another level than all the other popular rappers.|`|iQN5KGaTaa	LIL WAYNE EVEN THO HE IS A WHORE HE COMES OUT IN EVERYONES SONGS IF I ASKED HIM TO BE IN ONE OF MY SONGS BET HELL BE IN IT|`|U23DRFtbaa	Lupe Fiasco|`|BDVSOPL8aa	I completely agree|`|ExOpzS4Kaa	Lil Wayne baby|`|FomIa9jQaa	Lil wayne|`|zT5aa5kTaa	The main reason people pick Lil Wayne is because, some of the things he says, no one else would ever say, Lupe is insane but people aren't very smart anymore, and they dont know the 4 elements of hip-hop. So they like whatever sounds better, which is Lil Wayne, but lyrically Lupe, I like Lil Wayne better, but Lupe is a better lyricist.<br>  <br>  (* . . )|`|3dOqAw8Saa	Screw Lil Wayne, Lupe Fiasco is such a lyrical genius...if lil wayne stopped OD'ing on every single drug that exist...he wouldnt have anything to rap about....Seriously this is the same guy who came out with "The Block is Hot" a few years back...that among other very early songs (before the drugs) were horrible.

L343X8Glaa	Dude, things like this have happened to me before. Im not trying to say that your girl is bad, but she could just trying to figure out how desperate you are to have sex with her. I wouldnt do it if I were you because its pretty humiliating but if you dont care about humiliation then I say go for it and I wish you the best of luck!|`|Zq0hJk4Waa	You might not be Gay but you might be Bi cuz you're considering it! lol.... it's not worth it, i think dude... you can probably get some other pussy without having to do that sh1t. this are just my two cents :)|`|p6BXHhxnaa	Instead of asking everyone on an online forum if you should kiss a boy so you can have sex with a girl, why don't you decide for yourself?  I'm sure you can make up your mind, you retard.|`|H0VBtkkLaa	Definately not. Do you want someone to knock the crap out of you or what? Dont do it.|`|RKLFYS2Naa	EEWWWwww you're disgusting!!|`|90oHw9CLaa	ummm no. if u do she will probably think ur desperate AND ew!! if your homophobic then i dont know how u could even think of kissing a guy|`|lwFA0EL6aa	honestly i dont belive you.|`|NwTfohGdaa	u sicko!|`|qGT4zXGMaa	Wow. That's a tough one.  Do what you feel comfortable with.  I mean I don't think you should do it but it's up to you, make your own decision.|`|V4oOyR0waa	that sucks. That is a really bad dare.  . but if u get to have sex  think i would do it|`|KFwXBXv7aa	NO|`|vpeZTL9Laa	no, cuz it sounds GAY!|`|V5K66Xb4aa	well you asked for all these comments by declaring your homophobia<br>  dumba**<br>  maybe because you are only sixteen, you cant look at the big picture, but i seriously doubt this girl even wants to have sex with you, she probably asked you to do something that would make you sick so you would leave her alone. <br>  and in the future, before you ask a question on here, remind yourself anyone can reply to it, so why dont you stop being a child? and look up the meaning of the word 'fag"  and only use it in its proper context.|`|GIkyDUulaa	i think you should do it.  one kiss...and then you get sex.  great reward :]<br>  <br>  anyway, the experience will be interesting, have fun with it|`|pbPe614Raa	do whatever you want,im surprised the obvious answer didnt hit you sooner.|`|Nb6gkiHbaa	can u say desperate?

CNSGz12zaa	Born that way...why would they choose to be gay when the world is filled with bigots who hate gays, they have to hide their feelings and get picked on and worse. Do you really think somebody chose to be gay. God made them that way, don't know what for but everything he does has a purpose. Only a gay person can answer this like me...did you choose to be straight?|`|EPaYoJaiaa	It's really something that's more to do with your beliefs than anything else. Maybe one day probably very far into the future science can tell us for sure if it's something you're born with or something you choose but for right now we have to work with theories. You just have to figure out what you believe.<br>  <br>  Personally, I don't think humans were made to be 'meant' for either gender. They were given the gift of free will and with that the word 'meant' (i.e. man is meant to be with woman) gets thrown out the door and anything goes. To me you can choose to be gay about as much as you can choose to like apples over oranges, vice versa or hate both and be in love with banana's...you don't choose that. It just is. Most people that are gay say they knew from when they were very very young. I don't know why anyone would choose to be hated and discriminated against. I know I didn't choose to be heterosexual I just am...why is it I can't choose but they can? Sure they can control their actions but then they'd be more prone to depression and all kinds of other psychological crap that shouldn't have to be dealt with because they know in their hearts they are different and though they try not to be they just are. What would you rather have? someone who becomes depressed because they can't be who they are or someone who is happy and just so happens to love the same gender? There's too much hate in this world already, if two women love each other if two men love each other then it shouldn't be stopped, no matter what anybodies 'God' says. The God I believe in wants love in this world above all things. Sorry I went into a little rant there I know you said you have nothing against gays but sometimes i can't help myself lol.  Whatever you choose to believe though, whether you're born with it or you do choose I hope you respect the opposing opinion. Like I said there's too much hate.<br>  <br>  You can't have double standards here, double standards suck and should be banned, if you don't choose to be hetero you don't choose to be homo either.|`|ZSlXrXsCaa	You are born gay. If it was a choice people like Matthiew Shepard wouldn't have been murdered.|`|PK2mFkQ5aa	it happens naturally because its one of natures ways to control population. if people arent attracted to the opposite sex they wont have babies. Its chemicals/genetics, something is different between homosexuals and heterosexuals that make it this way.<br>  <br>  The reason that this was considered a sin back in the days that the bible was written is because back then it was al about power in numbers and passing on the family name, so it was impractical to be gay. but no, since the population is getting out of hand, people being gay may actually be a good thing.<br>  <br>  Animals in the wild/zoo are gay, and we all know they don't have the mental capacity of humans. They didnt choose. its natural.|`|cIvFOzoiaa	It's just as natural for gays to be with the same sex.<br>  There are gay animals.<br>  Science has backed the fact that being gay isn't a choice.<br>  Nobody would choose to be gay in this homophobic world of ours.<br>  People don't choose to be left-handed.<br>  You can't turn gay or straight, people just think it's a choice because they're bigoted.|`|MzMfafKLaa	You're born gay.<br>  People need to accept that and get over it; how would they feel if they were one of the people that were born gay, they don't know what it's like, you don't choose it, you just have feelings, and you know you're different.|`|QBFjMRfuaa	born|`|FJPKtZN5aa	you are born gay...because i am gay and i never choose to be...if i did some one forgot to inform me about it? <br>  and look i have just come to terms with being for the last 2 or  so years and i wanted to be str8 so bad but now i believe i am what i am and thats that.|`|StJGeiFyaa	i don't know why anyone would choose to be different in that way. so in that sense i think that one must be born that way. honestly, does it really matter how people end up gay? it's something that we should all be able to accept--like other races, religious beliefs, etc.|`|KKhc5UiYaa	I guess technically your born gay but really your not your just either turned on that way or not|`|grYkoDaraa	it's natural for us to be gay.  its just like how you are born left handed or right handed or with blue, green or brown eyes you can't chose it yourself.  email me i like this argument|`|RsXOS3aqaa	youre born gay<br>  people are so ignorant why choose it?|`|0e88c2210c8510ae47dbd15b433d18a8aa	My Personal opinion is you choose to be this way!<br>  <br>  Have a Blessed day!|`|4dXcZhuTaa	born..<br>  scientifically proven.<br>  <br>  get it through your skull and do some real research silly man|`|OGCohFyNaa	There have been neurological studies done in gay men comparing them to both straight men and straight women - and it's concluded that gay men are more neurologically close to the mentality of straight women than they are to straight men. Certain thought patterns emerge in gay men that are more typically found in straight women rather than straight men. <br>  Based on that information, I would say that it's likely that they are born that way. I suppose that there is a possibility that in a nature vs. nurture scenario that the neuro-pathways could be altered by a person's surroundings and upbringing, but I really believe that it's more of a natural thing.<br>  Hope this helps!|`|lNT22A0Caa	Alright I just did a research paper on this topic....<br>  and my position was that sexual orientation is DEFINITELY A CHOICE.<br>  <br>  I anonymously polled a large number of people who identified as straight, and i asked them if they had ever been attracted to somebody of the same gender. as it turns out, 1 out of every 4 straight people (so 25%) has been attracted to somebody of the same gender at least once. so what about that 25%?? bottom line is that THEY MADE A CHOICE! they probably could have dated the same gender if they wanted to, but they didn't want to, so they didn't<br>  <br>  plus, with more than 6 billion people on this planet, it seems highly unlikely that even a gay person could not find ONE person of the opposite gender that they're attracted to....|`|b6c9b3f40f9ac8337ea22396c739b02faa	Let me put it this way. At no point in my life did I ever make a CONSCIOUS decision to be attracted to women. I just AM. So by the same token, I believe that when gay people get to a certain age, they just find that they are naturally attracted to the same sex. I can't imagine a straight guy CHOOSING to screw another man, it's inconceivable to me!<br>  <br>  EDIT: Yes. So if they were born straight then it would be natural for them to be attracted to the opposite sex too. But they aren't. SO they must be naturally attracted to the same sex. It's the only logical explanation.|`|FD0cZu9Uaa	imho<br>  Some are born, of that i have no doubts<br>  Some I believe choose to be gay because of family or gender Identity issues.<br>  with women at the moment being Bi is so popular its like a fashion tend. I know several girls who claimed to be gay in high school but then "switched" in college and went on to marry and have children with males.|`|naI5hGjHaa	let's make this real easy for you.<br>  <br>  it's about attraction.  you either are sexually attracted to one gender or the other or both.  it's also the emotional ability to fall in love with someone.<br>  <br>  you are still straight even if you aren't having straight sex.  how do you know you are straight?  because you were born that way, and you know who you are attracted to and long to be with.<br>  <br>  Just like gay people are gay even if they aren't having gay sex.  How do they know?  same way you know.<br>  <br>  YOU KNOW.<br>  <br>  those that go back and forth are either truly bisexual or more often confused or just experimenting|`|30883ff483f22f53beffad5289158812aa	Brain studies show that lesbian and straight men share similarities in brain structure as do straight women and gay men. Also, it has been shown that hormones in the womb affect the sexuality of newborns as well. Current research seems to strongly favor the born straight/gay stance.|`|psLk5fDGaa	The more research done on the subject, the more we come to find that it isn't an option. Surely though, a traumatic event you experience as a child can greatly affect the way that you perceive the world, possibly your sexuality.  <br>  <br>  Looking at our animal friends is a great way to see that homosexuality has always been around. Male dolphins for example have sex with other male dolphins. They also have sex outside of their own breed of dolphins and rape each other. It's an interesting way to view the things that we think humans own evil has created. <br>  <br>  So, in my opinion you do not choose to be homosexual. I'd find it very odd that anyone would choose to be ostracized from society by not being what we consider 'normal'. <br>  <br>  Also, if you haven't seen the movie Prayers For Bobby you should really check it out if you are interested in this subject. I learned from it and later researched things that it says in the Bible about homosexuality. In Leviticus, for example it says that if a man lays with another man, he shall be stoned to death. BUT it also says that if a child disobeys its parents, they shall be stoned to death and if a woman is not a virgin on her wedding day, she shall be taken to her fathers house and stoned to death.. Neither of which we translate literally. <br>  <br>  Hopefully, scientific research on the subject will prove that it is a biological mishap.. or a mutilated gene that makes us heterosexual or homosexual. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps. =)|`|mK1qUhkqaa	i think it's both.  i asked my gay uncle one day and he said he knew he was gay when he was in kindergarten!  then you ask someone else and they say something different.<br>  <br>  and for Kelly<br>  pedophiles are normally psychiotic,<br>  which means they were born that way, their brains are wired differently.  i mean cmon, the normal average adult doesn't wanna have sex with a 7 year old. you gotta be pretty messed up to do that!!|`|ZJH2tun5aa	WHO in their right mind would consciously choose to expose themselves to danger and ridicule just for being who they are? would choose to have to hide their true selves out of fear and a lack of understanding?

Since you are a kid, you act like you were a little girl and play with dolls or do things girls would do so that is the first sign. Maybe you dont discover you are guy until you are older like 16 or 18 or something like that but you were born to like men or women all along.|`|JuWL7T0Haa	People don't just turn gay.  They are born that way.  I mean when you got older and started to like girls that was natural right those feelings just happened for you.  Well gays or lesbians feel the same feelings you do/did only for the same sex not the opposite.  If you have gay friends though why wouldn't you just ask them how to explain it.  I don't know I'm not gay so I can't really explain it better than that.  Hopefully it made sense to you!|`|pd6SaHBOaa	I didn't "choose" to be staraight so i assume the same is for gays. They were just "born" that way.<br>  <br>  I think a lot of these answers are shocking. And people wonder how such hateful things have occured in human past?? How people went along with the Holocaust or Segregation? People like these.<br>  People are unwilling to accept. Just admit you are stuck in your thoughts, and will never "understand" how you can be born gay.<br>  If you have friends who are gay, why don't you ask THEM?<br>  <br>  STILL don't understand how ANYONE can agree with the pedophilia comparison. <br>  *shakes head* ugh, humans.|`|enW5Iai0aa	man wasnt made to be with woman.  man most likely wasnt made period. unless aliens made us, its more likely of that than god.<br>  <br>  second. <br>   <br>     being born gay is possible. when we are all kids, we dont really look at a grown up lustfully. but we do get crushes or feelings for people of the opposite sex, usually. when those kids are ghey, they look at a man and feel the tingles, than they just feel that way for the rest of their lives. thats it. they feel strong connections to men, and eventually they want to get personal with another male. and shame doesnt affect their choice or feelings, they just go with their gut and soul.|`|sOzkTuqjaa	nature versus nurture.

You don't chose, and I think if God is all loving, then he wouldn't restrict homosexuality. (LOOK IT UP! Gay means happy, not homosexual!)<br>  <br>  No one choses to be so. I mean look at the racism today, why would you chose to be so? It is how you are born.<br>  <br>  Why is the sky blue? Why do fish swim?<br>  <br>  Homosexuality is a trait you are born with. I don't hear anyone going around asking why are some people straight? Why is she black or why is he Asian? The question is prejudice in and of itself and to be avoided.<br>  <br>  Gays are people just like everyone else, we feel, we love, we hate, we laugh, we cry. There is nothing different from us than any other person in this world, we are just sexually attracted to our own gender.<br>  <br>  If you think it was a choice, tell me about the day you chose to be straight.<br>  <br>  Also, if it is a choice, then do this- chose to be gay for a day, and then chose to go back.<br>  <br>  It's a simple fact- you do not choose which sex you are attracted to.

Now that they are back together, they will be together again to do the job that the island wanted them to do.|`|1b862af8ea593285689e97efd8ee0d2faa	they have time before little Ben even shows up on the Island with his father. And more than a decade, maybe two, before Ben takes action.<br>  <br>  If they are still around when that happens they will take refuge.<br>  <br>  oh, and it seems like Ben and Locke are in modern time, while the Oceanic 6 are in the 70s.  <br>  Ben was transported by the island itself to another place.  So he never was part of either the people who were time shifting on the island, or the people who needed to get back to make things right.  He is his own little category of traveler.<br>  <br>  Locke died.  It seems that when you die you are released from the time jumping thing, as was the red-head who died and was not transported with the other in the last time jump.|`|CFZ4ISNNaa	Good question! I was thinking about that too.  So now we know why Daniel was filming the Dharma movies and told Charlotte not to comeback to the island. I think they make it off the island before the surge. I'm confused, but Lost is getting pretty good.|`|e4e6e071fbaff222f423d536811dc00eaa	I wondered about the same thing but Ben is back on the island so he will be able to warn them when its going to happen there is no way the show will go down with them all dying in the 70s damn that would suck lol

6qDhXpWfaa	Special A - there hasn't really been an ending yet, but if I remember correctly there is no real love triangle. It's not mature, it's romance and comedy. <br>  <br>  Lovely Complex - REALLY funny and so sweet. For sure no love triangle. It's about a really tall girl who falls for a shorter guy. <br>  <br>  Nodame Cantabile - It's about this quirky, weird girl that falls for the most popular guy at her music college. He's cold, handsome, and incredibly talented and can tell she is too (though she plays sporadically in a way)<br>  <br>  The Wallflower - It's about this girl that's turned to the dark side, giving up her feminity after being called ugly by a guy she liked. Her aunt sends her to a house with four highschool guys who her aunt is renting the house too, telling the guys if they are able to transform her back, they'll be rent free and if not, then she'll double the rent. It's really funny and kind of sweet at times. <br>  <br>  This list is really short -.-'|`|AA11852077	Fruits Basket ends up happily(well, for the most of the main characters anyway.-_-'')<br>  Skip Beat is really great, romantic and funny--about a girl who entered the entertainment industry to ruin her Ex's life, since he completely ruined the chances for hers, it turns into a love story(I'm not at the end, so I'm not sure what happens)<br>  Nagaraste Airantou is cute, really funny as well. It may seem like this guy(main character) has to choose between all the girls on the island(unrealistic, I know), but it's really just about him and the one. It ends happily.:]

qNKK4hLDaa	well for one i'll tell you that tauruses aren't earth signs for no reason.  they're the most superficial kind of people i've ever been friends with.  i'm not saying that they lack deep thought and they just care about how pretty their face is, because [believe it or not] that's not true.  i also thought that they were hard to read, until i figured out that there really was nothing TO read.  they're the most down to earth people i've ever met if you want me to be honest<br>  <br>  so that being said, back to your question:  Do [Tauruses] try to figure people out?<br>  my answer, based soley off of personal experience [friends with a taurus for 7-8 years], is that they see people in black and white.  they see people as their friends, or not as their friends [i would say enemies but i really don't think they keep enemies.  they might make them, but might not keep them].  they're honest, sometimes brutally honest, which could be pretty insulting/rude to whoever the receiver, but their intentions aren't to hurt.  if they were meaning to hurt you, you'll know they were trying.  they're also pretty social.  if you have a couple of pleasant conversations with them, they'll be calling you "friend" in no time<br>  <br>  i think that your "ex's recent ex girlfriend" [lol] means what she says and doesn't have any intention on finding dirt in your name.  this was kind of hard to explain in words, but once you figure out how down to earth they REALLY are (it's quite surprising actually.  well to me anyways), i'd dare you to explain it lol.<br>  <br>  verdict: NOT GUILTY|`|ixHwF4apaa	be careful with them. they (not generally) are not dependable.|`|AA11245905	top secret said it all|`|55bffae43f7b7cfbd5b53cdc525c5a75aa	my experience say: be careful. I have (had) 2 Taurus girl as a friend. She will be so nice and caring at first, but then she will stab you in the back.. Maybe its just me in badluck, but anyway, be careful. Maybe you are right about her trying to make you jealous. My two Taurus friends are also tried to steal my crush and my bf by acting so flirty around them and always try to outshine me. I couldnt explain it here all of the details because that would be a long story. Anyway once again be careful because I think theyre so insecure.|`|BlZ6vJOAaa	First off we are very easygoing people with pleasant dispositions for the most part.<br>  I don't think she was trying to throw out a gripe.. she might be trying to feel you out .. and maybe even hoping for you to start talking about him or something.<br>   it's possible. This probably has more to do with her venus/mars sign.<br>  i personally as a taurus with venus/mars in pisces never try to feel people out that i don't know i wouldn't have ever mentioned your ex if i didn't know you too well.<br>  edit-- just ignore it and don't address those comments... but if she keeps mentioning him then its obvious she's looking for a reaction and then she's just bad news.<br>  but if she took care of you then it sounds like she might be a sweet girl. generally speaking we don't really try to feel people out. i've done it very few times ,, never in a mean spirited way|`|LU0tIFcRaa	I'm a taurus myself, and I don't think she is trying to figure u out. See, I already may have a read on a person already and theres no reason for me to try to figure them out. We can be the nicest and sweetest ppl u will ever meet and we will guarantee u will never forget us either. But when we mention something to u, we might be trying to give u a hint and want u to figure it out, like almost speaking in riddles. Like her mentioning ur ex. It's not to hurt u, because our intentions is never to hurt ppl we like. It can be to warn u. If we were trying to hurt u, believe me, u would know it. We fail to hide our dislike and disdain for a person we don't like  and we make it known that u sure as hell better stay out of our pathways. But she might be trying to get u a hint about ur ex or tell u that he may be trying to get with her and she may like him back and that's why she goes out with him, and she wants to know if you're ok with it, and she wants u to catch on to it yourself rather than tell u because it may make her look messy. Just sit back, be quite and listen.

I don't think we should treat it as offensive, because then it will lose offensive meaning, but since my friend was offended, i will not use it anymore.|`|T8fZOmdOaa	No....it's really not offensive to homosexual people at all.<br>  <br>  The word Gay originally meant happy or joyful anyway. <br>  Gay doesn't actually mean to be homosexual- it has just become a slang term and is usually not very offensive now as it is used freely in the ''gay community''<br>  <br>  Young people say it these days to mean crap or rubbish--or it's a word of disappointment.|`|aRESIRAqaa	I use it all the time...but most people only say it because they come from a family/lifestyle/culture ware gay's are not accepted or its considered discusting. Nobody really means harm in it against gay people...its just become a substiture word for lame. stupid, retarted, horrible, ect. When people say it they arnt thinking "dang I hate gay people" its not like using the N word or saying japs or towl heads ware discrimination is meant.|`|p0bQGSbaaa	to the white girl who said "*****" is like everyday slang for you, it should not be. fyi, it is offensive.  i know black people who refuse to use that word because of what it means. i know black people who will use it. but dont like when other ethnicities use it, some dont care at all.  point being its not in the same classification as "gay." sorry off topic - but gay is not bad.|`|tPsShxqIaa	In my blatant opinion I think people are stupid to use "gay" instead of "weird" or "freaky".  Its rather sad...and I have said it a few times, but thats because I am still an impressionable child.  But everyone makes mistakes, and I just think forgiveness should be just as popular.|`|U84CR98naa	Teenagers are harsh and think that it's funny to laugh about people being gay because it isn't 'popular'. I'm a teen and I hate it when other say 'that's so gay'. But they don't care if it's offensive. They just say it because they can, and out of habit.|`|HJ3Wx1UXaa	it's definitley not bad. i am 100% for gay rights and i even protested against prop 8. it's not really part of my normal slang, but when other people say it i'm not offended.|`|LL95bMIlaa	It doesn't mean anything, just means that's stupid, not gay.<br>  It doesn't have to do with anything sexual, it's just saying something is stupid.|`|yUtwVDzyaa	Yes, I say it, and I don't care if it offends people because this is America and I'm entitled to it.

I just say it though|`|aZtPJSLFaa	when i say that line i'm not trying to be an anti gay/homophobic or offensive or anything. i just say it cuz i think its so stupid. so instead saying its so stupid i'd say its so gay. but not trying to be offensive or anything! i dont think anyone would try to make it sound offensive or anything.|`|4EflpUK8aa	Not really. Gay used to mean happy, then it meant homosexual, now it means stupid. <br>  <br>  That's how I look at it anyway.

Smiling for when you're happy, not all the time. (people constantly comment on it and ask things like, "Um, are you laughing at me?" I'm not, I'm just sorta, smiling. Even weirder is I'm really not a happy person. Very sarcastic.)

AA10409668	How come no one is saying anything about the woman having the abortion in the first place?  --------------<br>  <br>  ABORTION IS MURDER!|`|c1b5c1de3f2bf9266efbd5d1416e2edcaa	This is disturbing, why did she wait for so long, and why did she allow that unqualified person to cut the cordon and throw the baby out? Plus where the fck was the doctor?!?|`|nlKZRNqmaa	that is sad.... : ( poor baby|`|By2QtFigaa	are you sure that's true?|`|ujsSyiJfaa	I think that is disgraceful.  The people who have abortions should be able to do so safely and without judgment.  If the doctor felt that this woman's child was "waste" he or she should not be allowed to work in an abortion clinic.  The people who work there should be more highly trained not to allow their personal beliefs to impact on their work.  Everyone deserves to be treated with respect, that includes pregnant women who have abortions and the aborted fetuses.  That makes me really mad.|`|kK4GG6Z2aa	Well, it does seem to be true.  The woman wanted an abortion so I don't think she has any right to sue or complain about what happened. However, I believe she will probably be mentally scarred for life. <br>  <br>  Part of the report reads 'Ms Williams struggled with the decision to have an abortion, Pennekamp said. She declined an interview request made through him.She concluded she didn't have the resources or maturity to raise a child, he said, and went to the Miramar Women's Center on July 17, 2006.'...    If she felt this way she should have ensured she didn't get pregnant in the first place. I know accidents can happen, but this is more the case of a guilty heart in my mind.  She saw the life once in her womb was actually a living breathing human being.<br>  I do think theat all the 'medical team' involved should be prosecuted in some way.  As abortion is legal I am not sure what they could be prosectuted for but malpractice might be a good place to start. And this should be brought about by the authorities. Babies born at that stage are often able to be saved by medical intervention and by throwing it away the practitioner therefor in my mind has committed murder.<br>  <br>  In saying all that rather matter of factly - I am absolutely sick to the stomach and totally horrified at the lack of respect for human life.  All parties concerned are in my opinion, utterly inhuman and the report made me sick to the stomach as well as incredibly sad. None of us really know what goes on behind closed doors in these clinics and perhaps it is time that we did. In essence I think it is nothing more than child abuse/murder.  I doubt if this is the first case in which a baby has been born alive and then disposed of.  This child would have been born alive and breathing even if it had been born on the abortion table. Maybe then the world will realise just how disgusting this practice is.  The question should be asked - why did the woman wait so long to go ahead with this abortion. It is an act of pure selfishness.  I do understand that there are some very reasons for possibly ending the life of a foetus - terrible abnormalities which would cause the child unbearable suffering if they were carried to full term  - if the continued pregnancy would damage the woman's health i.e. die in childbirth - pregnancy due to rape or incest.  However there are millions of women and men longing for a child out there so I believe that homes would be found for most children who are unwanted.<br>  <br>  There really is no reason today for women to get pregnant if they do not want a child.  One part of me believes in the rights of a woman over her body and the other part of me believes that the majority of woman who do have abortions for no other reason than  - they dont want a child at that time - or they are having a teenage pregnancy are irresponsible and unfeeling<br>  .<br>  If the act of abortion were shown more and more in the media - horrific as it is I believe many would go ahead with their pregnancy and either end up keeping the child or give it up for adoption. I try not to judge as I think it is none of my business what another person chooses to do - however having read this and pondering on what is possibly going on behind closed doors that none of us realise - I believe that we should all now make it our business and perhaps try and get the law changed. <br>  <br>  The gestation time in which a foetus may be aborted in law should be lowered - not that it would make any difference to the horror of it all. But this poor little mite would have suffered terribly in it's short little life and that makes me weep. It is a reflection of the world today - no respect for human life whatsoever. In addition perhaps women who have more than one abortion for nothing more than convenience should be sterilised. <br>  <br>  We are horrified when a child is abused or murdered and there is usually a public outcome with us baying for the conviction of the perpetrator - but these little one have no rights whatsoever. I could go on and on but I won't because the whole episode is so upsetting.<br>  <br>  Food for thought.. We will never know what a positive impact these children may have made for good in the world had they been allowed to live. Future politicians - scientists - doctors, brain surgeons teachers, great authors or playwrites etc etc.|`|st2zmU88aa	That's why i think abortions should only be done within the first 4 months of pregnancy when there is Absolutely no chance of survival, that girl was 5 months pregnant it should be illegal by then.<br>  <br>  although that's very sad and those people acted very unprofessionally..that still don't change my opinions on abortion.

Honestly, I thought he's gay, but i'm not sure about that.|`|9a3fC9mOaa	Congrats...?|`|LsE1RS0vaa	lol he loves to make women feel special. he has to make someone like him since he goes around saying 'i'm a pony'|`|StJGeiFyaa	this is an awkward question. i'm backing away...slowly...|`|dkPbRn95aa	whoa your mom must look like a dude, isnt richard simmons gay?|`|d2lvgxJhaa	How masculine is your mom?|`|EnBhiRp3aa	Sounds like a nice guy.|`|d9iXONYsaa	I'm sure he(?) wasn't hitting on her.|`|a1731418e68343f01ae82b7c12846cf2aa	I think he was just checking to see if she was fat so he could annoy her to Sweat to the Oldies.  Richard would never hit on a woman.|`|sZMa0s7Baa	HAHA that's hilarious. I love Richard Simmons.|`|04dc0d2596b5e8336fe567281e72fb2faa	Ummm... It is a common belief that he is gay. Just because you say someone looks great does not mean you want to bag them. Or maybe your Mom looks like a dude?|`|lnZyIc6Haa	He was just being "Richard".  He wasn't hitting on yer Mom...he's gay.  Now if he came up to your Dad, I'd worry.|`|Ict5JA4eaa	that dude has alot of issues. i mean look at his damn shorts. and hair. and everything.|`|mXG5H0mMaa	Richard is gay.  I doubt he was hitting on your mom, unless she looks like a dude.|`|MiKrWuM6aa	Maybe he was just being nice?<br>  <br>  He didn't hit on her, he's gay.  For real.|`|OJAC44eTaa	That's awesome!<br>  <br>  I don't know why he did it, but it's pretty cool!|`|qe8dOJqGaa	Mebbe he thought that bulge was a penis, not a babby...|`|iWLaHVbfaa	i think he was expecting her to say no so that he can offer her a  part in Disco Blast off....|`|f49NiNrdaa	Don't worry,he's not gonna try anyway.He's just jealous,I guess?!|`|82bce41e90ec1a1ebe71a56d61363b42aa	He thought your mom was a man.
Q5qpMLOVaa	Yes. I even Rick Roll myself sometimes, and try to act surprised.|`|M1OKvcqYaa	Yes, it always makes me smile!<br>  <br>  For the best rick-roll go to www.1227.com|`|hNa5oHxQaa	I got that song on my iPod.|`|r6oi1HyZaa	no, never heard of it actually|`|tmwOwc0Laa	No i dont enjoy it...|`|o0Badlndaa	Duhhhh|`|LuWT8KQBaa	It's extremely unoriginal, and wasn't even funny the first time it happened. It's just a fad people think is funny because it's popular to think that it's funny.|`|YnBdka6naa	No. You have to keep hitting that button. I've only been Rick Rolled once. I just restarted my computer because I got tired of hitting that button. >:||`|MQVmh5hiaa	Never heard of them. Sounds like a good song though.|`|Fk9RN6taaa	I've only been rick rolled twice.<br>  <br>  the song is okay, but not the type of music I listen to.|`|nuLroEjraa	gets a bit...<br>  gets a bit old.|`|5N3odm3Qaa	No, and thank you for not posting a link to the song.|`|JTSNljLhaa	no i just ignore it like it never happened|`|avk9GFiJaa	once or twice, but it can get annoying|`|0wZGrwJKaa	when i was playing the videogame Little Big Planet somebody created a level that had the rick roll'd song, and it was really funny. At the end of the level, it said you've been Sack Roll'd (because the characters you play in the game are sack people) and as i was looking at this funny video on YouTube it came on and I laughed so hard!!!! it was so awesome I bookmarked it. Dorky? Definitely. But it was funny|`|YlkotyRsaa	I always enjoy staring at a dancing man that could probably be my father, yes. <br>  <br>  Especially when I'm trying to do something else~<br>  <br>  (but the song doesn't really bother me)|`|TVzA5WE8aa	Honestly, that song makes me laugh all the time. Although it is a joke but it is funny.|`|8XL8aC3Qaa	yeah thats a good song|`|6Et02KS8aa	Sometimes, sometimes not, but it can get annoying at some point.|`|JvxwNufDaa	I honestly think it's stupid. I mean, I really dont get the whole big deal. I love the 80's, and I just really dont get whats so funny about it.|`|FLeEdSTxaa	It's funny. I've been rick rolled a million times, and I still haven't watched the whole video.|`|raKcYQJMaa	yeah, occasionally i don't mind getting rick rolled.|`|I6Eccjnqaa	Yeah.<br>  <br>  x)|`|CzIaAnsraa	This site has the funniest one! <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://smouch.net/lol" rel="nofollow">http://smouch.net/lol</a>|`|GK19Wczaaa	no, i always hate it
eWMYbWNJaa	It is really annoying when they are loud talkers. I put it in the same class as blowing your nose or scratching your head at the table.|`|BqHEeYA4aa	its usually a few specific ppl....the social butterflies that just wont hang up and be polite to the person they're actually having dinner with :S|`|6Z49DZaRaa	This always happens to me, but with texting! It's sad how we are with technology ;)|`|I6Eccjnqaa	Yeah,it happened to me today.<br>  <br>  :(|`|KhPJIyXhaa	No. That would be so annoying.|`|GK19Wczaaa	no|`|Ii7vzF65aa	Nope. And I'd probably just ignore it or text until they are finished.|`|Qq2MKeXUaa	Yeah, they are annoying.|`|V5K66Xb4aa	i used to be addicted to my cell but ive been cell free for 18 months now. im glad because now i actually care to know when i ask people how their day is going. cell phones make is easy to talk, but cheapen the personal connections i think|`|JTSNljLhaa	i have one but i cut it off during times like that i kinda hate cell phones these days it takes over people life and mind.. and yes im a 19yr old saying this|`|RzhbINzeaa	UGGH I hate it when people use LOL.|`|df210224ef66dd9f202cc00a96c6ff5baa	No
kqMDzJw0aa	Most definitely. This is mostly due to people's either a) ignorance or b) not being a tough New Yorker and not knowing how to suck it up and get a little "hard body" and stop thinking it's all about them.|`|GLMiQUcGaa	what are you stupid or something if its uncontroversial how could it turn ugly that's not logical. WTF<br>  nah just busting your balls<br>  yes that happens and i do it to people sometimes devils advocate is fun.|`|mKBveDhHaa	nooo =(|`|kFNFID3Baa	yes|`|AA10495187	no.|`|C6ZJcNJjaa	Yes, I have.  I asked if people who have to talk about how "hot" they are all the time are really ever that hot.  I was thinking of someone I work with but EVERYONE took it as a  YA thing for some reason and I got hammered with nastiness!|`|fia9gMHpaa	Yes I have. Too many haters.|`|qdsVS1dDaa	Yes, not on Yahoo Answers, but have in other  places. Meetings, for example.|`|2PTlXs9zaa	Yes, those are the assumers of Y/A. Know everything there is to know about you from one question you asked. Ignore them.|`|HmkCFddAaa	You know how it is some people can turn anything into a fight|`|st2zmU88aa	YES.|`|1RzQ3lK8aa	To have it get trolled? Hell yeah. Sadly.|`|jFALlQunaa	Yes, and it was so stupid. It was about hairstyles and somehow someone turned it into something ugly. I ended up by deleting it.|`|UiewAPE3aa	I can't believe you would ask this?<br>  <br>  This is a terrible thing to post!<br>  You should APOLOGIZE NOW!|`|V5K66Xb4aa	have you been in the religion section ever? <br>  everything over there is a test of faith.|`|oECtQgtlaa	yeah i guess i did :)|`|I6Eccjnqaa	No.<br>  <br>  :(|`|akvrwpywaa	Yes.|`|kuNCBosEaa	yes i know where your coming from.  Just ignore it bud.

The "Get the box of cookies" contest.  --Put everybody in a big room and make them fight for cookies.<br>  <br>  3. The 1000 meter run.<br>  <br>  4. The Smoke a whole pack of cigarettes fastest. (Passing out disqualifies).<br>  <br>  5. The disgrace yourself the worst in public contest.  Like public masturbation or something.<br>  <br>  A million dollar prize and you have to win all five contests.<br>  <br>  When nobody wins all five, the prize gets divided amongst a selection of the least arrogant and pissy of you.

But who knows, too bad if the did it (idts) because the girl is really little. If it was an older one I wouldn't care, cause they're probably annoying and phyco XD<br>  <br>  He's not edward cullen, and he's not trying to be him.|`|hpu4s84Waa	well he is DRUNK! what do you suspect? he probably cant even write his own name when he's drunk. besides he did say in interviews all over youtube that he does not like twilight AT ALL. and he never wants to date a twilight fan, because he thinks it is dum.|`|fmxjWn4Daa	Wow I just found out how mean is that to do to a little 5 year old girl|`|7fdb8953bd29b82ec3fe3944fec26284aa	thats horrable! if ppl think thats okay, their really mean|`|eK97o0wVaa	wow didn't know about that|`|AA11090423	No offense, you're a 'stupid twilight fan' if you think this is a huge deal. Robert's an actor. He's also English, and they can be strange, open people, hence the alcoholism. besides, we don't know the entire situation, these things are often fabricated. Robert ISN'T Edward Cullen. There IS no real Edward. Seriously . . .|`|x7fXMjHRaa	honestly i dont blame him, he has so many people following him all the time, from little girls to old women he is a human being ! and he gets annoyed from what it sounds like he is a private person and enjoys his privacy! and he isnt edward cullen for gods sake! <br>  <br>  when will these twilight people get over it?|`|k39bNUgeaa	Nope<br>  <br>  He did the right thing. I would have done the same thing if i was him.<br>  <br>  Didn't Kristen stewart just make comments about the twilight fans in her recent interview about saying how annoy they are|`|JeR9DyJyaa	But he's an actorrr. D:|`|6Ch7vbKfaa	You really don't know all the circumstances so it is hard to make a determination.  Robert is not Edward Cullen and we really do not "know" what a fictitious character would do in this case.  Give Robert a break; he is a human being and probably gets tired of being bothered from time to time.|`|GAdy3i6haa	i didnt hear about that.<br>  <br>  well considering the books were written before anyone knew who Rp was i would agree with you, hes no edward cullen|`|YCMUPkbZaa	Edward is not a real person, therefore it is irrelevant.|`|J9OUW7JRaa	ha ha yeah well if people followed you everywhere all the time then you probably would do the same thing if you were drunk!
XF1y4wMmaa	I love this scene. How he is telling her how stupid she is, while kissing her. That is the best love story ever. I love all of it. I cried so much!|`|KHL4N6mtaa	aw, i miss titanic !<br>  <br>  i love that movie, i've watched it about 6 times & the movie still makes me cry !|`|3mJQOY4Paa	I don't know but my friggin 8 year old sister watches this movie over and over and over and over all the time so I have seen it a lot! haha..|`|13c934012cf02b1ade18c8f6f6f4b992aa	Funny, funny.|`|2KX0ZInOaa	yes|`|bkgBLjuvaa	i've always loved that movie. even though i haven't seen it in a long time.
7pJ8S0Liaa	Never, I love my spouse too much to ever consider or to even think about being with another man.  That has never crossed my mind to do.  I sure hope that you are not going to do that either.  It is one thing to think it but to actually do it is another.  I hope that you are smarter than that!  You could really mess up doing that.  Miss out on the best thing in your life.  Wind up being with someone who doesn't care about you at all and is only there to use you for what they can get.  Believe me it might be the one person you wouldn't expect it to be.

TiN0pZjOaa	Hanging was the predominant method for executions before 1909. Other methods had been used during this time — three people convicted of piracy in 1700 were gibbeted, four pirates were hanged in chains in 1720, and a female slave was burned in 1737. From 1909 until 1994, the electric chair was used for all but one execution (that of Joel Payne on April 9, 1909). On February 2, 1951, four African Americans were executed for rape in one case and another was executed for murder in an unrelated case -- the most executions held on a single day in Virginia. On February 5, 1951, the remaining three defendants in the rape case were executed. The youngest person to have been executed in Virginia was Percy Ellis, who at the age of 16 was electrocuted on March 15, 1916. Only one woman, Virginia Christian has been put to death by the state since it took over executions from the counties. She was put to death in 1912 for the murder of her boss.|`|rXInAcURaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eMpsMukRfA&feature=channel" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eMpsMukR...</a>|`|fe8Wz86Caa	who ever you killed don't tell anyone and hide the body and act like nothing happened.|`|VGmBXLq9aa	Life Sentence to Jail<br>  Death =[|`|iPVaHiQRaa	i dont get it|`|LzSdvuY9aa	a spanking|`|8yb8mVMoaa	Woah!

frwlypDWaa	If you changed the password, you're the only person who'll be able to access the signal from your router.<br>  <br>  If she brings up the fact that she can't access it, you can tell her that you'd heard that someone else in the apartment had hacked into your router signal. (Unless she's a technical whiz, she'll find that plausible.)<br>  That's why you changed the password. If she asks for the password, remind her (nicely) about her offer to pay. If she doesn't pay, she doesn't play. Be firm, but polite. She's still your roommate, and you've got to live with her...|`|M8kNmWuAaa	Id say just change the password and put a password on your computer so she cant access it.|`|56sUBsbfaa	i will pay the internet money for her<br>  <br>  its just internet 50$ per month is not a big deal<br>  <br>  dont fight, live life and let others live|`|BqHEeYA4aa	yes ask that stupid woman! shes mooching off of u which is total crap.<br>  if she was able to get access without knowing the password before then im guessing she can do it again. but nevertheless, confront her. shes basically stealing from u

1PdUecpYaa	dude, it happens to me all the time. in fact, i've never been with someone who's astrologically compatible with me. i'm a pisces and i've been dating leos and sagittarius. it's not like i choose to date fire signs, it just happens. usually, you only find out their star signs after you start dating... so it's not your fault if you're stuck with a gemini. and btw, i'm sure pisces can get along with geminis. my closest friends are geminis and we stick together like glue....|`|2DAfAjv2aa	I'm a firm believer in the science and math behind astrology, and I do believe in it. Though, if I was dating someone that I wasn't astrologically compatible with, I wouldn't hesitate to shove everything I've learned about compatibility to the back of my mind. Astrology isn't supposed to rule anyone's life, and it certainly doesn't dictate who you should be with. <br>  <br>  Besides, chances are, if I like that person, there's something about the rest of their chart that matches up with mine. I try not to conjure up someone's personality in my mind the moment I learn about their sun sign. Planets like Venus, and the moon are very important placements to consider when reading a relationship.<br>  <br>  Virgo Sun<br>  Sagittarius Moon|`|R2hbZi1Faa	Horoscope compatibility charts are fun to read and all but when I really like someone I couldn't care less about what horoscopes say or anyone else for that matter ;)|`|kvDvAf17aa	im not a regular but i wouldnt care<br>  Im a Sagittarius with a Pisces moon|`|BlZ6vJOAaa	yeah i  am in the same position with a gemini<br>  i am a Taurus with a taurus moon pisces mars and venus<br>  so it sucks a little but because i don't know his birth chart its fair game besides hes so smart and sexy i can't help it but i admit when i first hear if someone is what i deem an incompatible sign i do  hold back a little and just make sure i have my eye on things for a little.<br>   its even worse because he seems to be a SUPER gemini person<br>  extremely knowledgable on all subjects<br>  very talkative and animated . he even has the high pitched voice!<br>  its incredible <br>  a v. gemini meets a v. Taurus who knows what could come of  it but i'm ready for it to just be a fling. or v. casual . they are good for that you know|`|BbBRS38Iaa	i wouldnt let it get to you because they can be wrong sometimes. mine and my boyfriend ( of 7 years) signs aren't compatible but we're still together. so .....|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	I would not care and if it did not work out, then so be it. <br>  <br>  Sagittarius sun, Leo moon

Which means it was lust and not love.<br>  While contemplating the object of the senses attachment develops, from attachment lust arises, when lust becomes frustrated, anger arises, from anger delusion, from delusion bewilderment of memory, when memory is bewildered, intelligence becomes lost and one falls into the material whirl pool again.<br>  Take care and best wishes always<br>  GOURANGA GOURANGA GOURANGA|`|90faa4cd94ef7f4fc6117ba415c52a62aa	to make a choice , u have to put one true option and others false , i find all the options to be false .<br>  <br>  death is the future tense of life , if divorce had been the future of marriage , nobody ever love to marry , when are you divorcing your husband ?<br>  divirce is not like a kidney stone , as it can be cured , but , when divorce happens , its rarely can be patched back .<br>  divorce never indicate that people have strted understanding each other , but they realize there capabilities of not able to understand or handle the other person , they give up and end up in divorse .<br>  marriage is costly , divorse is free of cost .<br>  if somebody is happy of divorse , then he is not  a man , as he is running way from his morals and his duties .|`|RReVnQHwaa	Your questions are only for earning points.|`|Fo9ADQLBaa	Banjaran, I have been divorced twice and married three times.<br>  The best truth is<br>  Don't get married, if you are not going to stick it out over the long haul; to "death do us part"!|`|B1mEwSXWaa	My dear Banjaran....<br>  <br>  Well....those are pretty nice "points", you've made and we can associate with them....However, my divorce went kind of "smoothly"...and without major "differences"....-<br>  <br>  When both "parties" have mutual consent, such a procedure can be handled within 6 months (when a child is involved) !

AA10479574	its ok. I kinda like it because you can actually hear Kevin in one line. he sings "you say low" I think its better than the lady that did it before on the Target commercial. she made it annoyingly perky.<br>  <br>  I dont understand why people were so mad and said all these threats for them because of it. they know they would never sing as well as the Beatles. they respect that so they dont sing Beatles songs (well on the last tour they sang a little bit of Hey Jude with other people so you couldnt really hear them that well but thats it) and they wouldnt have done it if Target hadnt asked. its just a song anyway and not a moving one at that like John Lennon's Imagine. Its not like Taylor Swift or Amy Winehouse sang it or anything so it wasnt as bad as people make it out to be.<br>  <br>  Im not really a fan of the song tho not even the original.|`|3ohj5wTZaa	I think that if Target needed someone to sing a Beatles CLASSIC, they should have chosen someone with talent.<br>  Ew.

N0PQLsucaa	Again, I'm really sorry to hear about it :-(<br>  <br>  I think that you should make the one about leaving first because this is why you are making the scrapbook in the first place.<br>  <br>  Second, I think it should be the sad one because it makes a story. (i'll explain near the bottom)<br>  <br>  Third should be the random one because if there are too many sad songs then it could get you out of the mood.<br>  <br>  Fourth, Should be the one about friends, because she will know how much you love her!<br>  <br>  And lastly I think the dance one would work because even though she's leaving, you guys will always be friends and that's something to "dance" about :-)<br>  <br>  <br>  *** Okay, so what I said earlier about how this is a story. It's kinda like, in the beginning she's leaving, you guys are sad but there's still time until the move and you guys start to think about the future and how random it is. lol :P And then you remember that you'll always be friends and that will never change and that's something to dance about :)<br>  ***<br>  <br>  I hope I helped and I think that it's really nice of you to make the scrapbook for her. I did that for my best friend when she moved. But even though times are hard, I know that she's always going to be my best friend no matter what. In fact, we write letters to each other in the mail all the time! He he!<br>  So just remember that even though your friend is moving, that you and her will always be as close as before!<br>  <br>  Good Luck xoxo<br>  -Sharon <3|`|Nf6ybJzUaa	leaving, sad, random, friend, dance|`|UsfkabYWaa	Leaving, Sad, Friend, Random, Dance, kinda sad but then it goes happy.|`|ekEoAVozaa	HEEY !<br>  <br>  Just wanted to say that I'm answering questions and watching American Idol too lol <br>  <br>  byee!|`|SYsAJH8Faa	friend<br>  dance songs<br>  random one<br>  sad one<br>  leaving|`|ed8c394758bb815b5025dbae82e638aeaa	leaving<br>  random<br>  dance<br>  sad<br>  friend|`|sCLhNgGwaa	leaving<br>  random<br>  dance<br>  sad<br>  friend|`|frwlypDWaa	1. leaving songs (your overall theme)<br>  2. sad songs (how you feel)<br>  3. friend songs (cheer your friend up)<br>  4. random songs (transition, some time to reflect)<br>  5. dance songs (big finish, upbeat)<br>   <br>  Nice gesture, BTW...|`|aQLDF2H7aa	1.

6In638rbaa	I'm not Indian so I find it as a very unique song. I like it though, it has a nice beat to it.|`|MelQSbHTaa	I'm not indian but I like that song. It's very unique and new. Have you heard the Pussycat Dolls version? I"m in love with that one! :]|`|AA11852077	Fun to dance too, it's all right. Not one for the "favorites" playlist though, in my opinion.:]|`|R8v712Gvaa	Haha that song is gangsta! jk<br>  <br>  I think it is AWESOME! I like the beat and the words i dont know<br>  <br>  Oh and i like the "JAI HO" part!|`|ZUqeOX2iaa	There r many other Rahman songs which i liked more that Jai Ho.<br>  Like his earlier songs in tamil movies...He was not so famous then...|`|sCCAtUYgaa	i like it, but i think O...Saya deserved the oscar more.|`|Vj9NicUsaa	im indian too & i LOVE DAT SONG!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  i lyk pretty much all da slumdog songs but jai ho is definetly da best!!! its da most playedd song on my ipod!! i think the rythm is  realli good aswell as the lyrics!!<br>  paper planes & ringa ringa (even though it sounds cheap..its catchy lol)are pretty gud too<br>  <br>  but in the movie wen theyr playin jai ho at the end & dev & freida are dancing..i dont lyk the dance, its not bollywood dancing at all...thats just a western perception of an indian dance & to me it just looks relli stupd|`|Qp3QWHTtaa	i love the beat and just how it sounds .. you  know what it means ya ? Jai Ho  <br>   and the 2 dancing together at the end is signif. so just adds to the song =)|`|05AXYrTcaa	AWESOME song...its catchy...and if you look at the lyrics it has a really good message....plus the movie was frickin awesome too|`|VdGNOxRMaa	im also indian and i lovee slumdog millionaire!!!i hate the dancing too its so ughhhh. they act like they are lassoing (or whatveer u call it) like they're a cowboy.
nwi5ZHk0aa	Yeah, I like him. :) He was definitely one of a kind with his quirkiness, crazy hair, hippie headbands and dramatic antics. I was honestly hoping he would make it into the top 12, but he was up against some tough competition so I figured he wouldn't make it. :( He wasn't the most talented contestant, but he sure would've added some major pizzazz and flare to the show! ha ha.|`|XnyFEfI6aa	I liked him. I wish he made it in the wild card round.|`|7jV4KAYtaa	HELL no.|`|VMfoMswhaa	i loved him! I think he was the only one who brought some fun to AI, he was just someone who I couldn't wait to watch. I don't understand why sooo many ppl hate him, thay just can't accept him for the way he is. I'm sooo sad he didn't make:( The judges are soo dumb they chose Tatiana!!! I hope he tries out again next year! <br>  Nate<3|`|m389Isf0aa	I don't understand why he didn't get picked for the wild card.     I thought it was a talent contest, some of the people who they let rhough aren't so great.  Nathaniel hands down sounded great and defiantly should have been a wild card pick!|`|6Ch7vbKfaa	He is ridiculous.  No where near an "American Idol" standard.... what a joke and the joke is on him, sadly.  He was too sensational.  The headbands were tiring.|`|d0PipICNaa	omg, I looooved him! :]<br>  He's the hottest person in the world. :D<br>  He's my future husband. :P<br>  It's too bad that he got voted off of American Idol. Seriously, who in their right mind would NOT vote for him? <br>  He's just so loveable! <3<3<br>  And he is very stylish. I love his tattoos and piercings. He was very unique and different. The headbands just made him more awesome. :]<br>  He made American Idol fun. I hope he gets a record label 'cause he has some talent.<br>  He's definitely my new obsession. :]|`|onUkjqJxaa	sha. he was amazing. lol<br>  i LOOOOOOOOOVE his voice when he sang disturbia. omg hes the best.<br>  i was really really shocked that he didnt make it in.<br>  but im sure he'll get a record deal anyways. <br>  after all that one wierd guy from last year did and he didnt make it onto the show. idk who he is i forgot him.<br>  but i really hope that he gets a record label because i love that guy. haha<br>  and i also love his headband. :)|`|UIoGLaKpaa	I loved him! He is one of a kind

AA10297143	My honest opinion is that American Idol has outlived its usefulness and should be taken off the air, so, No blondes necessary.|`|etV271ARaa	Yes. I think they're hot and talented. The judges keep praising them too. They deserve to stay
DOkWTB8baa	My explanation is that the majority of the fans are teenagers or younger. <br>  Saturday is a no school day, of course. <br>  So staying up late Friday night to wait for the DVD would be acceptable for them.|`|Klb4ZYcVaa	Not ALL DVD movies come out on Tuesdays.  Same with with movie premieres. We all know new movies are released every Friday in theaters. Sometimes it's on Wednesday, but rarely.|`|UEqiglhCaa	Sometimes the fil company does things like that on purpose. Maye they r doing that so that the DVD comes out exactly 4 months after hitting theaters.|`|w2IRT2xSaa	They do this sometimes with  movies. Not really sure what the reasoning would be:to be different, maybe hoping by putting it out on a different day will make it stand out so they can make more money. It is just one of the many marketing tricks they use to boost profits. If your upset that you have to wait till Saturday and want to watch it now, I would suggest going online and watching it. You can find it with no problem at all.|`|YvWpH3uXaa	i was wondering the exact same thing! love to know the answer :P<br>  check out the link in my sources, maybe there's something there, but i gotta get to bed! :~O|`|syrh8J6Vaa	Because the date will stand out making people remember it 3 2 1|`|beitkrfxaa	While most DVDs are released on Tuesdays, the studio decided to release “Twilight” on a Saturday “to encourage midnight release parties for fans across the nation.”
eZsOGcOwaa	Excellent!<br>  I would listen to it, if it had some nice music.<br>  Get a friend to make you music or something, then post it on YouTube, i'd love to hear it:D|`|3N7CwE4Xaa	hey I like it! :) especially for a first song it's really great. I would listen to it. I like this part:<br>  <br>  Because you're a dream boy from la la land<br>  And to you I'm just another fan.<br>  But I would kill just to hold your hand.<br>  And to me you are the greatest man.<br>  <br>  Keep writing :)|`|0wZGrwJKaa	it's great. I really like the ending "And you don't even know my name" !!!|`|KMcjfeX7aa	Sweet! Maybe you could make some music for it and post you singing it on youtube! no one will say u ruined it cuz ur the original singer! lol! good job!|`|5dDkydiZaa	veryyy nice work i would listen to it definetly you should make songs :)
k39bNUgeaa	Thankfully yes they are|`|duN63EkIaa	I don't see it as "coming to an end" at all. I see that they're going down in their popularity. I think everyone does, they just don't want to admit it. Which is good, they're losing the fans that only cared about them because they were the "hot new thing." <br>  <br>  You know what I've noticed? Looking back on videos of them in 2006, early 2007..they seemed happier. Not because they were just starting out and were new to everything..but because they weren't overworked. They weren't shoved into people's faces and shipped around like puppets to sell themselves out. They still had time to live normal lives without cameras following them and their imperfections being printed front page on tabloids. A lot of people want fame. But really, once you live it..and you know it, it's not as glamourous as everyone percieves. <br>  <br>  They have a new television show coming out, a world tour, a new album this summer, and two new movies. My thoughts? They're going to get sick of it. They're being pushed so much into hollywood that they're not going to appreciate things when it's given to them. It seems to me like what they're doing now is their job, instead of their passion. <br>  <br>  They need to go back to just the music. That's all the fans want. <br>  Like Nick said, "These fans are different." Yes, we are. Though I don't agree with their actions..I'll always stick by them, as will many others. They may fade from the "It" scene, but they'll still be doing this for a long time, because it's what makes them want to get up in the mornings. Music.<br>  <br>  <br>  Damn it. Sorry. I should now be known as. "That annoying Jonas fan girl that writes novels no one cares to read."|`|BQXg09m9aa	Doesn't look like it to me. I am not that big of a Jona Brothers fan, they are alright, but I'm not like...obsessed. I would never want them to disappear because they have so many fans that have lives that won't be complete without JB. <br>  <br>  I would never want the to end even if I HATED The Jonas Brothers, because just because it's something that I'm not too fond of doesn't mean it has to end because of me. The world doesn't revolve around me. A lot of JB HATERS, call the JB fans immature, but they are because they want a successul band to end just because THEY don't like them.|`|AA10344136	Yes....and it's about time!!  They wanted fame and fortune--and were blind to the price for such; now, they find out the hard way it simply doesn't suit them well as they otherwise thought.<br>  <br>  Each brother takes off in directions askew opposite the other; their overall management is way way way out-focused; in a nutshell: Jonas Bros. are done for.|`|7dedb1d505bc774b219a42c84ed2ca4caa	I hope so<br>  <br>  seriously, their fans will eventually grow up, and they are not the kind of band that people will stick with at all age<br>  <br>  That's the consequence of being a disney product, where they only appeals to preteen girls and its not because of their talent.|`|B3N388wBaa	Hopefully|`|M9EcpbmDaa	its funny how you get all of these people on here who 'think' they know what they're talking about.. 'yes the jonas brothers are coming to an end, i know' <br>  pfft, you know NOTHING let me tell you now!<br>  if anything, the jonas brothers are only getting HUGER by the days, sometime last year the jonas brothers wer barely known really, now everyone has alteast heard of them, some..are jelous of them cough* all the haters!* cough :)<br>  but yeah trust me, when the girls 'grow out of them' you've got the 4 year old girls to grow up in love with them and so on..i'd say there fans go to as young as 2..3?<br>  im 15 woo! and i'll support them always! its just the kind of music your in to and you cant help that can you? <br>  if half of these haters actually met the jonas brothers they'd be all over them like 'i love you' 'can i have your autograph'..i bet!|`|oimNn0HMaa	First off I am a HUGE JB fan! And they are here to stay! I am not some lil kid, I am 18 years old! That is why it sucks they are partnered with Disney because people automatically label them as childish!<br>  <br>  Would a 21 year old (Kevin Jonas) be in a childish band?! NO!<br>  <br>  JB has the most beautiful hearts and souls..<br>  <br>  And its funny because alot of the people who say they are childish are so much younger than JB themselves!?<br>  <br>  How can you call them childish when you are younger than them? What would that make you?!|`|JlYqg8z8aa	their movie careers are over after Walter the farting dog hits cinemas in 2010.  Jono + Farrelly bros = no one as the two fan bases contradict each other, good casting hollywood!|`|FbwyvwEYaa	Yeah, when all their fans (which are all girls) become older, and realize how gay they are.|`|1bwo1RLEaa	all i can say is....i definitely hope so. I dont think they are tho becuz of all the little girls that r in love with em|`|bltgAc9Maa	Hopefully...... *cross my fingers*|`|fe8Wz86Caa	nnnoooo!!!! neevveerrrrr!!!!!!!! aaaaaahhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|7fwEe9iZaa	yup. they're just a fad. funny people though.|`|1098c5a3a3f98c47f5dcb52edbd434baaa	you all are a bunch of low lifes..<br>  coming to an END?<br>  look at what they have coming up;<br>  <br>  WORLD TOUR<br>  TV SHOW; JONAS<br>  CAMP ROCK 2<br>  NEW CD COMING OUT IN JUNE<br>  <br>  <br>  how old are you guys?? 20+?<br>  stop hating. grow up|`|1wm0ZqIOaa	No way! There movie just sold out nation wide! They are also about to start their world tour! The Jonas Brothers are just getting started!|`|54vt2jXRaa	I think they are.  I used to like them, but they've kinda dissapeared.  I don't think they'll be around much longer.|`|4370ad7a4b04a26b8b14f2a4a483050aaa	yes i never listen to them ANYMORE at all
83lk0PSFaa	yahoo is always screwing something up. to be honest i love the concept of this site, but the flaws need to be worked out.|`|AA10910187	lately that's been happening to me too lol|`|8j70Neqeaa	its both of you|`|mXG5H0mMaa	I got best answer notices an hour ago.  Check your preferences?
9DjMGv5Uaa	I did! When I was 18. And it was TOTALLY an accident!|`|ItXNuvbVaa	no ... sorry i lovee my hair ... but does it count that when i was 2 years old my parents shaved my head? ( family tradation ... lol. )<br>  <br>  & i guess u agree with britney spears ... lmao. jks jks.  <br>  <br>   but yeah i lovee my hair! <br>  <br>  --iHeartu ?|`|BZEN8QXbaa	I want a Mohawk but my friends and family would kill me haha<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Edit-People that would laugh are a real piece of work,you don't know why she is bald.She might have cancer,do people think anymore?|`|nwsheineaa	Not really. And lay off the "Britney Spears" crap people! she shaved her head  to symbolize a new begging for herself... even though she didn't really follow through with it it was meaningful to her, so stop.|`|AA10784260	What no way that be so weird if every woman did that. The woman that shave their heads usually have a reason|`|xJqb88oAaa	It's in the bible, somewhere towards the back.|`|EOaFZoNtaa	no. i would only if i had cancer. or to show support for someone with cancer.|`|439b446684797c0e9f7a6234b423ec53aa	I almost had too, cancer scare last year...only if it's by choice|`|1vfockYEaa	Nope, never!|`|Ova4dilbaa	no.<br>  why would you believe that?!<br>  how does being bald help a woman in her lifetime?<br>  so she can get made fun of?|`|Wuo6qYQMaa	No...|`|K3D0g4v0aa	i think thas the lady's decision if she wants to or not. why do you think so?|`|EbZEP4zsaa	Ew no. thats kinda weird. But I knew a girl who did for breast cancer awareness. It was cool when she did it though|`|LOgmCZdzaa	ooo, get back to ya on that one.|`|kdv0t93Faa	no.|`|yixKb0ocaa	no, people might think you have cancer<br>  My aunt had cancer so she was bald for a while :/|`|AbYdBwqOaa	ive cut my hair really short before for locks of love<br>  right now i really want to dread-lock it for a year or two then shave it off.. <br>  i think that one might as well go crazy in the lifetime they've and if you've got the guts to pull it off- then do it! so if a girl wants to shave her head then she deff should. i mean, its not like it doesn't grow back, so why not?|`|tBJnxEjGaa	Now that would be a silly ridiculous thing to even consider. Speaking from experience ... sometimes even cutting your hair can end up a mistake - it does grow long again. I knew someone this happened to ... as well as I had my hair cut for my fathers funeral ... and 2 years later it still hasn't grown. Sucks ! Not to mention one gets "old" fast enough , hair falls out and baldness comes... why hurry it !|`|v42nC3F2aa	No, when I see a bald woman, I view her head as a cue ball. I think 6 ball in the corner pocket. Women should have long, flowing, beautiful hair.|`|ZwPX7lEjaa	I agree.<br>  <br>  Its just the renewal of everything.<br>  But my hair is ultra-thin .. so shaving it would cause it to become thinner :(|`|aa9e4f65153be65e413d2ff21b91c4d6aa	NO. But sounds like you've been doing too many drugs while hanging out in an Indian ashram, HAHAHAHA!  <br>  <br>  PS: There's no god, neither christian nor buddhist or whatever they call vishnu over there! ;)|`|vBIwaQ0qaa	Ummm, no, not really. I don't think I would look very good being a skin head.|`|nVh0Ut5Gaa	If you have head lice<br>  <br>  I would sooo laugh at someone if they did that at school. "Look at that ugly baldy"|`|6XIDmojtaa	only if your the president of the sinead o'connor fan club!|`|ygM3geiDaa	Only if there is some disease that needs to be treated. Otherwise, I disagree with your opinion.|`|QkohHdKQaa	noooo|`|aRMsI01jaa	Noo.. WAY!.|`|cauos8MXaa	No|`|eVPW1dwOaa	I'm DIEING to, but I don't have the balls! It would be so liberating!|`|CEQOLvp3aa	uhm no not inless they have canser or sum thing...|`|HuMDohbHaa	yes, lot of time when I was toddler.|`|pd6SaHBOaa	For what....?|`|twVyisGnaa	Only for medical purposes.<br>  <br>  VIVA LA RAZA!|`|AA10057370	100%<br>  <br>  no|`|i2NqmsBeaa	No Way! I love my hair!<br>  But if i had to i would, since everyone else would be shaving their head.|`|zRlDQ9JJaa	No|`|i9hHL7oNaa	haha. for sure|`|uhHfm3Azaa	hale no.<br>  <br>  <br>  (yeah, a jasper ref. don;t hate me :))|`|e2cf497fb8528f8c556d43e9580066c5aa	YES<br>  It would be pretty damn cool to have no hair for like a DAY haha<br>  ok maybe for a week|`|aVZgY4S8aa	The only way I'd shave my head is if I was going to donate my hair to one of those cancer organizations. That would be it.|`|vIcOdePzaa	Absolutely not, I would never shave my head.|`|zhjXam01aa	Britney Spears would agree.<br>  I don't.|`|KKhc5UiYaa	only if she happend to have cancer or wanted donate her hair|`|DhmUgq0maa	Nope|`|aecb4dafb246d2ba2a5f9769eed979b7aa	Not really lol unless im getting paid.|`|4f9vyUEoaa	No.
509ab94cda4b4fe17a16012bdb328fb9aa	If I could heal the hurts and wounds of others with just a touch or with loving words, I would do it freely and generously.|`|VXW1XeFsaa	Perhaps the diseases and handicaps that many people live with are actually teaching tools that cause them to develop the strength of character to go on to a great destiny in their future.  Several people who started successful businesses like the founder of Kinko's (now Kinko's FedEx) struggled with dyslexia.  Jackie Joyner-Kersee struggled with asthma but is one of the greatest athletes.  Actors and media gurus struggle with M.S.  Sometimes, illnesses and disease give people the determination to accomplish something that they wouldn't otherwise do.  Breaking my foot made me decide to finally run the marathon I'd been thinking about for years.  I'm glad that I can't take away the thing that someone may need for their personal growth.  My job is to offer support and encouragement to those who struggle.|`|AA11367986	I would share it, but I would find a way to do it where I remained incognito.  I don't really like the attention that much.  It would also be free.|`|d4f6400ded99a1dec7d1c509edd9fae1aa	Hmmm probably hide it since I wouldn't want to be kidnapped by a government agency and treated as a lab rat but I would use lots and lots for free.|`|rzZXJz0qaa	oooo good question and a very good power.<br>  I would share it ( but use discreetly ) <br>  I would do it for free.. If given a blessin like that why be greedy.|`|4EZcG3YSaa	Id heal everyone for free|`|2b48276b9853c62d36478108dff9629baa	the buzz that would come from spontaneously healing people who are ill and grieving would far outweigh any cash compensation ...... i'd share it luv and i'd do it for free .......... only those who believe that you could help them would benefit anyway so there wouldn't be any point in hiding it.<br>  <br>  peace baby<br>  ?|`|n1JxNnpZaa	I would hide it and use it discreetly without people knowing.|`|nnOVIOV9aa	I would heal as many as I could...for free,  Their smile would be payment enough...|`|oDL02s8kaa	i would share it and do it for free!!|`|k1Aio2qdaa	I would share it...do it for free....I would feel that is may way of giving back!!! Hey Tony!!!!
pMVhxRpGaa	I just roll my eyes at the "based on a true story" claim. Maybe bits and pieces are true, but they twist everything else. <br>  <br>  I did see that Angelina Jolie movie "Changeling" that is based on true events and it is good...but it isn't a horror movie, though the events depicted are truly horrifying...|`|d9iXONYsaa	They mainly use eyewitness accounts, police reports, things like that.|`|eWMYbWNJaa	I find it annoying so many people think ghosts, spirits,clairvoyants, fortune tellers are real.|`|YnBdka6naa	The people that tell them the story...people say the the darndest things.|`|W2qyu5zFaa	I love those movies. They scare the **** out of me. I believe in ghosts though so I guess it wouldn't be as good if you didn't believe in them.|`|Xvvru0O1aa	Yes! Ghosts arnt real!!!!!!!|`|I6Eccjnqaa	Yeah,I'm with you on that one.|`|mSt1LGfjaa	yes it is,,then it makes you think whether it was even true,,|`|eS9nPWqBaa	I don't care what proof they have...i'm a wuss
426a3dee7ed8c56e74b81f48767f2bbaaa	First off, I don't repeat rumors about me or anyone else. Second; I really believe everyone has had a rumor spread about them or will have sometime in their life. Probably more than once too.|`|bY149rq5aa	Well, so it was raining out.. I had to take my dog out for her 'bathroom break' [poor dogs have to embrace all sorts of weather just to pee.. Lol.] Anyways, I slipped backwards and automatically thrust my arms out behind me.. And could have been probably badly injured if I hadn't.. But I recieved many terrible [and mostly] scrathes all over my hands and wrists from just.. Falling, kind of sliddling around making things worse.. [hill] And it's like, falling knife like rain.. Yes, it was terrible. So I got some temporary cuts on my hands and wrists and arms.. And I happened to be sad about something at the time.. So this girl, my 'friend', makes this rumor about me cutting myself.. It wasn't a fun experience.|`|KWV6ZtBsaa	hmm a few but most of them were trure. lmao<br>  one time my friend posted a bulletin while i was sleeping over and she was saying that this girl kept calling and saying **** to her and she gave my number and some of her friends called me to cuss me out it  was freakin hillarious|`|d4c9a4d52a9e77de4545721ac937c02faa	Some b**** on my bus when I was  in 7th grade told people me and my bf at the time made out in the back of the bus, and she also told ppl we had sex, disgusting. I hadn't even had my first kiss yet. I'm 16 now, still haven't, and luckly no rumors since then :)|`|l1iCPVPOaa	Yep, the one I think is funny is that this girl said I laughed when her horse died :'D<br>  <br>  lmfao .|`|ynLWX4s1aa	that i was a snob. but really im just shy around ppl i dont know.|`|4D6xfsnlaa	no|`|4FHHuD0daa	no... what did you hear??|`|gVOeroPeaa	lol, one that i killed some kids dog. XD he made it up, but to scare the s*** outta him, i went along with it, photoshopped a few pics here and there, you know, the works XD<br>  <br>  oh and once it was "common knowledge" that i was an alien. my neighbor made it up a WHILe ago, cayse i went to a different school (private school...ugh) and i was never around XD<br>  <br>  and one that im an extremely sexy guy, with a large weiner,  which is absolutly one hundred percent true.|`|aDhZIhQcaa	Yes.  When my husband died from cancer June 19th 2008, my mother in law told people that I had murdered my husband, which is ridiculous considering how long I was married to him and his doctor told her she was nuts.<br>  The second rumor was that while my house was full of people everyday when my late husband lay in a hospital bed....apparently I was down the hall having sex with some man....they haven't made up their minds which man it was, but I told them to make sure he was awesome looking and make it really dirty.m  LOL  Thank God my husband wasn't around to hear that crap.|`|p7yaM0qiaa	yes i have and i laughed about it. im a plus sized girl and have been since high school. a friend of mine came up to me one day and said that he heard something about the two of us. i said ok let me hear it. he said, well apparently we have 4 kids and u r pregnant with #5. i laughed and said wow i knew there was a reason i was so fat!!|`|8RgbvVT6aa	Yes. Everyone has whether they know it or not. One was that I liked a guy. I like him now but at the time I didn't. Another was that I had sex with a dude. But that was an easy one to solve cuz everyone knows that i am a good girl and waitn till marriage.|`|ekEoAVozaa	Well, <br>  There was a rumor about lots of girls at my school. Big ones. Like sex rumors and such.<br>  <br>  But yeah...<br>  <br>  My friends will usually tell people about who I like and stuff.|`|zfD0NX5oaa	yeah, there was a rumor that i kissed a girl over the summer while playing spin the bottle.|`|y2MMr8m7aa	Yes, and one was that my last boyfriend and I had sex. HE STARTED IT. Totally didn't happen.|`|HEDSOHq1aa	multiple rumors that my iq is 185|`|fiOWiI3uaa	Stay Cool|`|xorPm2gOaa	I think.......|`|aYqCb3olaa	yeah,<br>  that I have sex with<br>  girls behind my old school<br>  but its not true,<br>  I'm still a virgin|`|yzgS5KiQaa	Yeah, my ex boyfriend made it up when he found out that I liked someone else an that's why I dumped him. He spread the rumor that I was a sl*t that was sleeping with a bunch of older guys. Made my life the teenage drama version of hell.|`|AA10471659	Yes they usually were about something i didn't do but they spread and , like i was writing love letters to someone and they were embarrassed and  was  Not True, but it wasn't any body's business, I was writing them for my friend to give to a girl he liked. A  Cyrano de Bergerac thing.|`|qdPtCBJeaa	A long time ago...a "good friend" started one that I was cheating on my husband with a friend of his. Untrue of course...I would never. <br>  So I played it up when ever my husbands friend was around.<br>  Just thought I'd give them something to talk about....which was the funny part because everyone knew it wasnt true...and they all played along with it too.|`|8aa2f76f19d65cc5bc682422bda1ee49aa	Yeh, many many years ago when I was in 12th grade, some "goonie" nerd guy would follow me around school and word had it that he was going to ask me to the Prom.            It ended up he didn't.|`|yw3Jze2naa	yes..<br>  there has been plenty. but one is that i do drugs (i dont).|`|H4f2dXVLaa	Of course<br>  so many.

ucVBQrbvaa	When we were in grade school,my youngest sis and I devised a GREAT plan to 1) get laughs and 2) annoy Mom. We would come downstairs dressed in each other's school clothes! We're only a year apart,so we were about the same size when we were in the 3rd or 4th grade. The first time we did it,we just acted casual(while Dad,our 2 older sibs and a couple of their friends were DYING of laughter!),while Mom screamed at us that we were just put on this world to torment her! Of course,we went upstairs and quick-changed in two minutes flat and nobody was late.Mom always made it a point to take us aside once in a while and tell us that she wouldn't change a thing about us,even if our rather colourful personalites were a little irritating sometimes.Mom,Dad and our two older sibs are wonderful people that I love more than life,but they're kinda *blah* when it comes to laughter sometimes and me and my sis filled that void in the house.<br>  <br>   Another good one! When we were about 7,maybe 8,my mom was washing sis's hair in the tub.I just happened to be in the next room,which was Mom and Dad's bedroom,to get some paper for something I was drawing. I heard my Mom say "Rinse the shampoo out,I'll be rght back". She went downstairs(for what,I don't know),and I was struck with a BRILLIANT IDEA! I took my clothes off,went into the bathroom and told my sis to get out because I would "sub" for her during this bath.She "got it" immediately and left for her bedroom(dripping wet and tracking water through the hallway,but this is in the name of FUN!). When Mom returned,I was there,sitting in the exact same position my sister was sitting in and I said "I rinsed the shampoo out..."    THIS is the funny part....<br>  <br>   She paused!!! She looked at me,turned her head to the side and started THINKING! LMMFAO! It's like she was thinking "wait,I thought I had the girl in here,I have the boy?!?!?". I think we froze all of reality for her with this one! Of course,I started cracking up right away and sis came back in the bathroom(STILL dripping on everything),laughing too! Mom simply reached her hand out and dunked me,then told me to get to bed! But she was laughing as she said it and to this day,it's a story she tells in spurts,because she's laughing SO hard as she's telling it!<br>  <br>   I <3 my family|`|5OF2k8D2aa	Yes! Here's one:<br>  Brother: I'm going to a concert.<br>  Me: Oh you evil bass turd!<br>  Brother: Bass turd?<br>  Me: Yes! You are the poop of a fish!!!<br>  Mom: Shut up! I'm watching the Sopranos!|`|aecb4dafb246d2ba2a5f9769eed979b7aa	Haha yeah its hilarious.|`|zGPwttIraa	i hear a lot of random phrases/sounds/word after loud sounds get lower/disappear|`|DRSv6SOLaa	LOL! They used to be now my kiddos are grown up and gone!  :(|`|YnBdka6naa	Lol. Yeah a lot of weird/funny things are said around my house!
UpJbXh7Vaa	Yeah it pretty much sucks.

I don't mean to sound mean or anything, I just know how bad it sucks having a gravel driveway, when I grew up in a house with a pavement driveway. I have a gravel driveway now and it's nothing but a pain in the butt! The rain washes it out and then there's nothing and it looks like crap. Then you have to buy new gravel, which is outrageously expensive, to replace all the old gravel. Trust me, pavement is way more convenient and it looks a lot better.|`|YQZdBHFpaa	i would rather have a gravel driveway. it looks nicer, its cleaned up easier...when it gets too dirty to clean, you can just get new gravel rather than having construction workers at your house putting in new paveent..and no, i think it is an interesting topic..it would help the gov to know what people want to buy and what they want their house to have on it, so they can make more of whatever. and youre welcome.|`|8vzUHPJdaa	pavement so if you forget something in the car and need to run out barefoot it won't really hurt<br>  I used to have gravel and it hurts like hell to walk on when you have no shoes.|`|Xf8Z6rJfaa	i'd rather have pavement.

pISC6pphaa	We put gasoline in our car, which is the same thing as "petrol" to the British.  It is a liquid, not a gas.  :)  Unleaded gasoline.<br>  <br>  from wikipedia: asoline or petrol is a petroleum-derived liquid mixture, primarily used as fuel in internal combustion engines.<br>  <br>  It consists mostly of aliphatic hydrocarbons, enhanced with iso-octane or the aromatic hydrocarbons toluene and benzene to increase its octane rating. Small quantities of various additives are common, for purposes such as tuning performance or reducing emissions. Some mixtures also contain significant quantities of ethanol as a partial alternative fuel.<br>  <br>  Most current or former Commonwealth countries use the term "petrol", abbreviated from petroleum spirit. In North America, the word "gasoline" is the common term, where it is often shortened in colloquial usage to simply "gas". It is not a genuinely gaseous fuel (unlike, for example, liquefied petroleum gas, which is stored under pressure as a liquid, but returned to a gaseous state before combustion). The term petrogasoline is also used.<br>  <br>  It also says that "petrol" used to be a trade name (like Kleenex or Q-Tips) and was used thereafter as the name for the product, no matter what brand it was.|`|C6ZJcNJjaa	I would wonder what the hell to do if the signs said petrol....|`|VLCUDZlcaa	gas and petrol are the same thing - gas is short for gasoline which is a liquid and petrol is short for petroleum which is also a liquid.<br>  <br>  i thought gasoline (refined) was made from petroleum (un-refined)?!<br>  <br>  The 'gas' we use in Australia is not actual vapour but a liquid also...(its gasoline)..lol<br>  <br>  very confusing and i may have it wrong but that is my understanding of it!|`|ERGGLvYiaa	The Americans usually say for example "I need to get gas" when needing to put fuel in their car.|`|mBlcD6sRaa	this is the same mob that say MOM<br>  <br>  i thought gas comes out of your bum after eating a dodgy kebab|`|bb0487e3f4e58641a40d9c9b91ae1826aa	Another word for the same thing.|`|AA11120560	here in the states we fill our cars with gas (short for gasoline) we have never used petrol. We usually have 3 grades of gas to choose from.<br>  regular 87 octane  mid grade 89 octane  and premium 91 octane in a couple of states you will find regular  with lower octane and in others you may find 88 and 90 octane available too.... <br>  <br>  on other place where we may get gas other then a gas station is a mexican restaurant but that is a different story... :D|`|d417ff78c87187a951bf9bd51ab28d23aa	ok we go to a "gas station" to get gas, its petroleum gas sometimes the station(gas store) is called petro world or gas house but we say gas i dont think ive ever heard someone in life say im gonna got to the store and fill up on petrol, just gas.|`|lCHcKdbXaa	Its gas. Well i say gas, everyone here says gas, unless its actually petrol and we just call it gas|`|OYITN4S2aa	In the United States we say gas, or gasoline.|`|WUBZad2Maa	We say gas for cars and fuel for semi trucks|`|nyeuuDFqaa	Here in the UK we say petrol as well...

frwlypDWaa	Interesting question. If your employer expects you to pay for anything that you break, then I guess they would dock your pay (or just take the money from you), with the understanding that since the bottle broke, the contents can't be consumed. That gets them off the hook with regard to your age. I'm sure the authorities would agree, and wouldn't prosecute your employer.|`|2OBP8fqJaa	Open container law.

2BpkXSnqaa	Me Too!<br>  I hate abortions .<br>  How can a mother kill her own would-be child?<br>  What wrong has that little-one done?|`|kJMzyFrsaa	Abortions shouldn't be a controversial subject.  With all sorts of birth control available there should be no need for abortions unless to save someones life or in the case of rape. You want to play take precautions. <br>  <br>  My beliefs on life are different than the average persons and I believe than human life can't be destroyed by abortion, but only denied existence in this dimension. <br>  <br>  I'm pro choice and it's solely up to the discretion of the person who has to make that decision.|`|OYITN4S2aa	What the hell is the point of answering this question, every time I express my views on this some opinionated @sshole thumbs me down.<br>  <br>  I believe that it's a woman's body and that it's a woman's choice. If she doesn't want to have the baby, she doesn't have to. Women have rights too. But I also believe that women shouldn't use abortions as an alternative to condoms or birth control.|`|DtBE35wHaa	This is why they have the Roe vs Wade always up on the supreme court table, I do not believe in abortion but I do believe in adoption for the right people|`|0hykdwBRaa	Yes I agree with you. An unborn child does not deserve to die and the woman should go through with the pregnancy but, what if the woman was raped? It was not her choice to do that. Those are one of those difficult situations huh?|`|k9tQqJpUaa	I think the same. I have tried to get people to agree to ban them in cases except for rape or where the woman could die. No one's on board, they criticize us for those but then won't compromise.|`|0wHeVJ50aa	I'm totally against abortion. Why kill something so innocent, when you decided to open your legs?|`|sTbUR32haa	Pro life. I believe we dont choose who lives or dies and that goes for abortion, death sentence, and war (but i'm kinda iffy about war)|`|frwlypDWaa	What business is it of mine if a woman wants to have an abortion? Or yours, for that matter? We disagree on whether an embryo or fetus is a person. Your definition is faith-based, mine is based on science. That doesn't mean you're right and I'm wrong, or vice versa, it means we differ. In the US, the bottom line in that there's no law against abortion, so our opinions don't matter. And I wouldn't want anyone standing between me and my physician on any matter relating to my health. That's why I'm pro-choice.|`|INf502UUaa	Mhm, and what about the case where a woman is raped? Do you know how much she would suffer?|`|5BOZ2ryLaa	"the woman put herself in that position".  If only it were that simple.  There are multiple reasons why women and girls find themselves unexpectedly pregnant, including birth control failure and rape.  Not every female who gets pregnant accidentally was negligent.  My personal opinion of abortion is that it is occasionally a tragic necessity.  I'm glad I never was in a position to have to make that choice myself, but my heart goes out to people who find that it is the best thing for their lives and the lives of those around them.|`|WMR8hVlfaa	Pro-lifers care about the fetus until it's born... then you better dare not ask them to help you care for the baby you didn't want. And most of those babies that get put up for adoption? Never go anywhere -- especially if they're not white. They end up in the foster care system, getting shuffled from home to home, often experiencing atrocious abuse and neglect.<br>  <br>  I'd rather a child not be born than end up unloved and unwanted, abused and neglected.|`|st2zmU88aa	I am for an abortion as long as its done within the first 4 months of pregnancy..i am not for partial birth abortions.<br>  <br>  Although its not something i think i could ever do, i still believe its the women's choice. Its her body. and she should not be judged for it.<br>  <br>  In some cases an Abortion is the best decision|`|Rak2TnaXaa	I'm against it unless having the baby would harm the mother.  Then, it should be choice.

I mean someone pointed this out to me, if you think about it the people who sang country music on american idol have been the ones to make it big. kellie pickler, carrie underwood, um carmen rasmussen or however you spell her name is starting something up. i mean Kendal was amazing.|`|zXQMS04haa	I love Lil Rounds.

nwi5ZHk0aa	Episode 18 of Privileged, "All About A Brand New You", was the season finale of the show. At the end of that episode, the words "to be continued..." were shown on screen. That doesn't mean there is a part 2 of that episode. That means that you will find out what happens when (and if) the 2nd season of Privileged premieres. By the way, Privileged has not yet been renewed for a 2nd season, so things are not looking good. But you never know what might happen regarding that decision. Like I said, though, the only way you get to see a "part 2" or find out what happened after the finale is on the next season of Privileged.<br>  <br>  I'm not completely sure that this is what you were asking, but hope I helped.

Just try to go by yourselves & if it doesn't work find an ADULT|`|DqKuqwpkaa	17. but who really cares about ratings nowadays?<br>  they won't stop you, it;s not likely.<br>  and unless you're really childish and immature, most R movies wont do you any harm.

It's not really music, I like music. Country is annoying too, I think the lyrics are so funny, but the music is so whiny, gotta hate those accents. There are A LOT of different types of Rock, many involve no screaming. <br>  But I like a lot of different genres of Rock. <br>  Emo <br>  Screamo<br>  Alternative (few, very few)<br>  Dark Cabaret!<br>  Rock & Roll<br>  Progressive<br>  CONCEPT (COHEED AND CAMBRIA)<br>  SOME metal<br>  And a tad of grindcore. Only if im in a bad mood.

VQmHIrStaa	Rock is the shortened slang term for Rock and Roll.<br>  <br>  The term Rock and Roll was coined by the DJ Alan Freed.<br>  The original (first wave) rock and roll was 50's Rhythm and Blues that was performed and written by white artists like Bill Hayley, Elivs, Jerry Lee Lewis, etc.|`|0vm66wlcaa	Well, technically there is none.<br>  <br>  But I think "Rock and Roll" as the big picture while Rock is more specific. That's just me, and many would contest my idea.|`|4bc3ee931fca2067bef8aafb614f2089aa	They're the same thing.<br>  Rock is short for Rock and Roll|`|quIDrXktaa	Originally rock and roll was a term coined by American radio DJs to describe a hybrid form of music with a rhythm and blues feel that had been 'whitified' by crossing it with some country and western, pop, and gospel elements and was suddenly massively popular with American teenagers in the 1950s.  It was a very specific genre with pretty standard instrumentation and song structures. The 'rock' and the 'roll' were particularly about the beat/backbeat.<br>  <br>  That genre continued to expand to encompass and adopt elements from other genres and stretch it's own boundaries and moved on fairly quickly from it's originally quite limited axioms.  It soon became and expression of creativity, rebellion and nihilism.  <br>  <br>  Rock as a term was introduced as a more all-encompassing term to group all the different subgenres (including RnR) as being of the same root stock but definitely not being classical, Rnb, Country, ethnic or Pop  -  but over time even those artificial boundaries were blurred.<br>  <br>  Or, as allmusic puts it:<br>  "In its purest form, Rock & Roll has three chords, a strong, insistent back beat, and a catchy melody. Early rock & roll drew from a variety of sources, primarily blues, R&B, and country, but also gospel, traditional pop, jazz, and folk. All of these influences combined in a simple, blues-based song structure that was fast, danceable, and catchy. The first wave of rock & rollers -- Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, Buddy Holly, Bo Diddley, Bill Haley, Gene Vincent, the Everly Brothers, and Carl Perkins, among many others -- set the template for rock & roll that was followed over the next four decades. During each decade, a number of artists replicated the sound of the first rockers, while some expanded that definition and others completely exploded the constrictions of the genre. From the British Invasion, folk-rock, psychedelia, and through hard rock, heavy metal, glam rock, and punk, most subgenres of rock & roll initially demonstrated an allegiance to the basic structure of rock & roll. Once these permutations emerged, traditional rock & roll faded away from the pop charts, yet there were always artists that kept the flame alive. Some, like the Rolling Stones and the Faces, adhered to the basic rules of traditional rock & roll but played the music fast and loose. Others, like proto-punk rockers the Velvet Underground, the New York Dolls, and the Stooges, kept the basic song structure, but played it with more menace. Still others, like Dave Edmunds and Graham Parker, became rock & roll traditionalists, writing and recording music that never wavered from the sound of the late '50s and early '60s. Although the term "rock & roll" came to refer to a number of different music styles in the decades following its inception, the essential form of the music never changed."|`|bUXJXk94aa	Rock is just the newer slang term, like Green Day or Fall Out Boy now. Rock and Roll is just like the older stuff, you know, Elvis and The Beetles and such.|`|jA1ukKSHaa	Haha there is none?<br>  <br>  Rock and Roll is just a term to Party =)

37rqJ1XBaa	all websites that say so is a hoax and should get a kick in their asses|`|AA11442722	There are some decent ones. The points add up to money. Don't expect to make lots of money. A couple years ago I did lots of surveys and made maybe $100 out of it. Today I do a few here and there. Recently I traded in points for $20 of Amazon credit. Took me about 6 months to accumulate those points, maybe 30 surveys. I've gotten T-Shirts and other stuff to test as part of surveys in the past as well.  <br>  <br>  Surveyspot used to pay pretty decent for surveys and had tons of opportunities to take them. <br>  <br>  Evans data pays the best but if your not a programmer your not going to qualify for them. <br>  <br>  Harris polls is pretty decent about their surveys. They are who I got th Amazon credit from recently. <br>  <br>  Npdor used to be really good about cash. Last time I took a survey there it was getting pretty cheap on things. I've recieved items at least 3 times from NPdor surveys as part of the survey. <br>  <br>  Polling point has lots of surveys. The rewards are not so great unfortunately. Takes lots of surveys to earn them. They usually have lots of surveys though. <br>  <br>  Since the economy tightened up the rewards have gone down dramatically on the survey sites. Anyway hope this helps.|`|YnBdka6naa	No, none pay you real money. I do a survey thing called ZoomPanel though. You take surveys, earn points, and turn the points in for stuff. They have some pretty good things on there. You could always get something and sell it to someone for money. Lol. It does work, I turned in 3,000 points for 5 different skins for my iPod. And I'm working on getting more points for something else, don't know what yet.|`|AA11369490	no but theres this one i used to use, my lot<br>  its kinda like yahoo answers but you get paid one or two cents a question not much but if you use it alot it will add up<br>  i signed up when i was younger and couldnt have a paypal account so i was never paid so i dont know if it really works or not|`|yDp2hNc5aa	go to www.inboxdollars.com. My husband does this and supposedly if you reach $30, they'll send you a check. I signed up for it too but just been too lazy to do any surveys. I don't know how much Eric is up (not up to $30 I know that) but I know that the surveys don't pay much. <br>  <br>  That's the only website I know of. Good luck|`|W2qyu5zFaa	Some do. But they don't pay you much.|`|bnRL4ruNaa	I have heard about those. I would not do them because they can spam your email and such.|`|L5WOXXRWaa	Dont bother|`|GfzaszPPaa	yea there actually is one|`|Jx4rXCEqaa	yea but its not worth it you will have to do like  100 to get a $1|`|8XL8aC3Qaa	yeah there is.. but its not even close to minimum wage|`|I6Eccjnqaa	I'm afraid not.<br>  <br>  Usually they're too good to be true.|`|b60e07f79c44c712de0ab0ea550ce5e5aa	I dont think so|`|Kbgc6x5raa	inbox dollars does i've been doing it for quite a while now|`|aQLDF2H7aa	I'm still waiting for my checks :(

So, they decided to show the same episode again next week so that I could watch. It was my idea for the content of that episode (the Sawyer and Juliet  thingy), so they are trying to accommodate me. I think JJ is the greatest writer around and he certainly has "pull" in the broadcast arena. Thanks JJ. As a side-bar, have you noticed how may character names begin with "J". That's because of JJ.|`|4imsjgE2aa	I can't figure it out, because I show they are repeating tonight's episode, "LaFleur". next week, same time.  <br>  <br>  Scrubs will be on from 7-8 and the repeat of Lost on at 8:00p.m.cst.<br>  <br>  My guess is there are stretching the episodes to last the season.<br>  <br>  Disappointing.|`|xugO6cDsaa	All they are doing is what every other show does around this time frame.

Then Life on Mars will be on at it's regular time.  Then on the 18th they will show Scrubs at 8, New Lost at 9, and Life on Mars at 10.

She makes Bella look too stupid.<br>  <br>  4th, Edward's skin didn't really portrayed what was written in the book. He looked exactly the same when he went into the sunlight.<br>  <br>  What I like about the movie,<br>  <br>  1st, it's about vampires and who wouldn't love a good vampire romance story.<br>  <br>  2nd, the set of the forest is beautiful and the Cullen's (except Edward and Rosalie) did their characters justice especially Emmet. Kellen is one Hot beefy vampire!<br>  <br>  3rd, Robert is cute and funny in some scenes. His acting was great.<br>  <br>  4th, the starting scene of the movie that had the deer running for it's life was amazing! Beautiful! <br>  <br>  <br>  Now when it comes to the Jonas Brothers... The Jonas Bros are pretty mediocre, and people are right to complain. But that's Hollywood. Hannah Montana is nothing special either. Nor is Taylor Swift. Nor BRITNEY. There's nothing new about this. People need to take a deep breath and remember DAVID CASSIDY, THE BACKSTREET BOYS, HANSON, and the rest. This happens EVERY GENERATION - IT IS NOTHING NEW.  The Jonas Brothers do write from real feelings. No ones claiming it's the most lyrically sophisticated or deeply emotional stuff in the world, but come on, the oldest of them is 21. Besides Nick Jonas' struggle with Type 1 Diabetes, and a few minor relationships, they don't have all that much to sing emotionally wrought songs yet. And yes, they do have some songs that are just catchy pop-rock, but not all music has to be emotionally wrought and by tortured artists.  There will always be this type of music, so I don't understand why in history, every single time a pop band like this gets big, there always has to be a big backlash. I'm tired of musical elitism in this world. Sure, some music is better than others, but why do people get judged for playing or listening to certain genres? Look at the ratings, even most of the girls under 18 gave it a bad rating. The band deserves 1 for being totally uninspired and unoriginal and for having terrible lyrics, so the movie deserves 1. Pretty logic. The movie isn't for fan only, it's for everyone.|`|zXR3r8dtaa	That's kind of tough, since both are very well-known.  I'd say both are blown way out of proportion.  I mean I don't mind reading the Twilight books or listening to The Jonas Brothers' music, but I wouldn't go crazy as some people have.  <br>  To me, obsession is stupid.  No offense.|`|5OF2k8D2aa	Twilight definitley. Girls that absolutely ABHOR the JoBros LOVE Twilight.|`|R7vYsGyZaa	Jbros for the lil kids as in (4-9) and then they discover Twilight and freak out about it untill they find some other vampire book.|`|bd4ZbN8Saa	i would definitely say twilight. it has attacked all age groups.....love the series!!! but it annoys the hell out of me that it has become such an obsession with people......kinda ruins it in a way.|`|sQrE2hRRaa	The Jonas Brothers|`|591LuLECaa	Twilight....really.|`|WNqbpFkqaa	Twilight!!!<br>  its the best<br>  vampires<br>  death <br>  blood<br>  awesome!!!!!|`|qMUVJX4gaa	Twilight because it has a broader age range.|`|XOgKRrANaa	Twilight<br>  <br>  but i hate both of them|`|pokzjgU4aa	they both suck!!!!

a2b8641f3900ff3887ba8bb3aa67fb65aa	*Maybe because of the added responsibilities that they will have to shoulder from then on !!~<br>  They think its the end of the 'carefree' days of bachelorhood !!~?|`|C6ZJcNJjaa	It definitely puts a damper on things, especially when none of your other friends are married.  They think marriage "changes" you somehow and you've suddenly forgotten how to have fun.|`|R9nfrBGPaa	that is so true! i am married and very indepandant as my husband is a very busy man i usually do things alone like going out, shopping and all, we also have differant friends and social life but somehow people keep on reminding me that im marreid! like if i go out with friends and come home late next day everyone will be asking me "what did ur hasband say about ur coming home late?" <br>  or if i even talk about a guy they go like "but ur married right?" so what? i cant talk to guys anymore? its annoying!|`|TTt51jutaa	If anything it is a start to a new life with a new family of your own.

I agree tat marriage is a big thing, but it does finish life.. So if we dont want 2 feel like tat then we should marry, when we want 2, nd wen u r ready 2 take up responsibilities.Compromise after marriage is fine, but b4 marriage is not so good. So, most important thing is our mate should b as compatible as poossible.|`|PDqg5OMgaa	Hai dear,<br>  <br>  Don't know. i too have fear on marriage.<br>  When we are loving each other for 4 yrs but even though we have some misunderstandings, but that is not my fear.<br>  <br>  My fear is, my mom is depended on me. so in future if my husband may change then what is my mom's life? future?.<br>  <br>  And there is always a second thought that after marriage we wont get privacy, cant act self, should depend on hubby. etc.<br>  <br>  I accept there is also some positives after marriage. but while comparing Negative are more than positives.<br>  <br>  (thing and act positive)<br>  :)|`|HuMDohbHaa	After marriage a life of compromise and adjustment starts.but it is not   always true that there is no life after marriage .it depends upon ur lifemate.For me it is wonderful.|`|Qs0wWbN5aa	In my view this is the last important thing in ones life, after that you have just duty to do. may be that's why.|`|JUG7cZkEaa	probably beacause they loose their license to flirt with other people...atleast ideally one shouldnt!...hehehe!!!
PDqg5OMgaa	Hai dear,<br>  <br>  "Money" is important for life.<br>  Its just part of life. "NOT LIFE"<br>  <br>  According to me, Due to the money some relationship are occurring but its not real affection.<br>  You can judge a relation with and without money. <br>  You know when i worked for Rs. 4000/- Indian value 6 yrs before even my sister ate my flush. (that is she taken all money and now she is well settled but i was poor, 4yrs before)<br>  <br>  When i am empty my friends really given me boost and i came up on my life. but now i am good position,<br>  <br>  (according to me other relations( not only husband and wife ) are looking only the money.... money.... money....<br>  They dint know money is zero only affection stays 100%<br>  <br>  (think and act positive)<br>  :)|`|R9nfrBGPaa	yes its very important but if ur relationship is strong it will servive trhough the money crisis|`|jROpVbrhaa	Now a days money is very important in human life.Without money you cannot buy your basic needs.Specially now a days that prices arr going high, and life is very hard.SO Yes money is very important.|`|TMjpWxU5aa	Money..<br>  It is a very dangerous thing..We humans created everything 4 our comfort.. but each n everything is harmful 2 humans..<br>  Money is also one among them... <br>  It should not hav ne space in a relations..It spoiled many relation..Relations can stand 4 long time but not the money..<br>  As we spend money it goes..but as we spend more time in relation, they increase..<br>  I feel tat Time is more important than Money..<br>  Money is managable, but not the Time..|`|ergI4qQPaa	Well well dear it seems that you have asked  what no one has been able to figure out for years now...anyways i have been married for nine years now, my husband is not a very successful professional and I am the major earner of the family.It does get difficult believe me when we are unable to buy that toy that my son so very wants and all the little things.<br>  So dear friend, my sincere advice is if you are planning to get married please make sure that you both have you finances figured out, plan smart and act smart.<br>  Secondly if u are dating someone who is well very materialistic and needs a lot of gifts to please then she is not the right one, money and love are equally important in ones life and the absence of even one will create problems.|`|TAdRXsU3aa	MONEY hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm........<br>  it is not life but it is imp if u want to survive<br>  u shud never let money rule u.|`|HuMDohbHaa	Money matters definitely.My personal experience says that becoz when I lost my father my relatives came to help us financially and helped us in our rainy days but they started dictating my mom in each and every thing they started interfere in every way.there respect for us changed to dominating behaviour.|`|SvaneHOFaa	Yes money is important for ppl around u to respect u(in this present gen).But ur friend or a relative would be one who will be with u even without dont have even a  penny.

PumYhJSvaa	The Bridge.<br>  <br>  The Bridge focuses on the large number of suicides that occur each year at the Golden Gate Bridge, capturing footage of the suicides and interviewing family members. Also interviewed are people who have attempted suicide at the bridge, witnesses of the suicides, and a jump survivor.<br>  The movie was shot with multiple cameras pointed at a notorious suicide spot on the bridge during 2004. It captured 19 people as they took their final plunge, and then offers interviews with grieving families.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  This documentary looks so interesting. I know watching it would break my heart, but I really do want to see it. It's not surprising that people would choose such a beautiful piece of scenery to end their life. I have never understood trying to plummet to your death. There is always a chance of survival and what a painful survival it would be. I really want to hear what the survivor has to say about their ordeal.|`|IpR1DiDAaa	You can watch it on Google Video:<br>  <a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=the+bridge+documentary&hl=en&emb=0&aq=1&oq=the+bridg#" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=th...</a><br>  <br>  And no, the filmmaker didn't set out to make a film about the Golden Gate Bridge and "discover" the suicides. Suicide was always the subject. He just lied to the authorities to get permission to film.|`|AkBx09UGaa	The Bridge - Not for the faint of heart<br>   <br>  This is the hardest movie I have ever watched. Eric Steel set out to make a documentary about the Golden Gate bridge. He setup cameras to film the bridge and ended up catching people jumping off instead. It turned into the story of why people choose this bridge to end their life. Getting through this movie took multiple days as I had to shut it off when it got too heavy. You’ll know if you want to continue with it after the first five minutes, but if you make it through it will resonate for a long time after

Pokemon has been around for 13 years, and ash is still ten. But what I hate the most is Team Rocket. They are so annoying. Why do they still try to capture pikachu if they are going to fail?

f639092fc925bbd55e7b6272eeb17334aa	She is a black widow. She finds surgeons, teaches them to have sex on nitrous, and then she marries them and kills them for their money. Sean is next on the list. When and if they do an autopsy the results will show the doctor was an addict and that he overdosed. It will be ruled an accidental homicide or suicide. She will inherit the man's fortune. Now that Christian is out of the picture on his honeymoon Teddy will have time to get Sean to increase his practice and make more money for her to inherit later on. So long as you do not fall in love with Teddy you are fine but the moment you do fall in love with her she must devour you.|`|16d2c815eb66a6fa1a02c49f202e6347aa	She is definately psycho,,,,,and that was a doctor she killed, I was thinking she wanted to get rid of him, so she could concentrate on Sean,,but then, when she commented, "you shouldn't have fallen in love with me", I thought, "oh hell, so now when Sean falls in love with her, she will kill him?"----too bad, time for Sean to find someone normal again!|`|T9fek24eaa	I dont think he was a doctor, he was just someone else that she was seeing.

I laughed a little bit when I read you question, because it reminded me of a story my sister told me of when she was with her friend at school in the deaf hall, but that actually is kind of sad. Imagine people suddenly staring at you, pointing and snickering for no reason you know of! That's embarrassing, and it is kind of making fun of your sister in a way.

aZtPJSLFaa	idk|`|shvhgzXeaa	Because the popular people have a lot of confidence whereas the "losers" have no confidence in themselves so therefore don't do as well as others.

In my school, with the exception of about 3 of my friends, most of the smart kids are not "popular".  <br>  <br>  There is a lot of diversity in that aspect.

They became popular because they were pretty and athletic and smart, etc.|`|Kbgc6x5raa	lol cuz the teachers like them or b/c their sports coach makes the teacher gives it to them the good grade so that they can stay in sports<br>  (happened all the time at my old high school)|`|xESvfzQAaa	Seriously, you need to ask that?  It's not common sense?  If you're fat, ugly & stupid not too many people are going to find you all that personable and thus a loser.<br>  <br>  However, if you are smart or put in the effort to be athletic or good looking people will find you more personable and thus popular.

It is both musically and lyrically genius - you've got the 7-8-9 complexities and Fibonacci sequence in the music and amazing lyrics, especially at the end:<br>  <br>  With my feet upon the ground, <br>  I lose myself between the sounds <br>  And open wide to suck it in,<br>  I feel it move across my skin.<br>  I'm reaching up and reaching out,<br>  I'm reaching for the random or whatever will bewilder me,<br>  Whatever will bewilder<br>  And following our will and wind, we may just go where no one's been.<br>  We'll ride the spiral to the end and may just go where no one's been.<br>  <br>  makes me feel a little hopeful and optimistic about the future and kind of one with the world. its like taking drugs through listening to music.|`|gaBmHADIaa	Undertow is my favorite song because it creates in me a sense of urgency especially at the part where he says "down on my knees" and the bass starts to play a lot louder than usual.|`|DSmrGy34aa	Aenima!<br>  It's such an angry song.<br>  It's cool.
jfEb0tIJaa	Vicarious- Its about how we all act like we care about everything and everyone but really we love to see pain and suffering but not in the 1st person but can't admit it.  The thing is the world is and will always be a place of death, pain.  We should all accept it and not have the pointless internal dialog of something that is part of life.

I did get to write an essay on the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn about whether or not Huck was an anarchist, and that was cool, especially since our teacher gave us some anarchist propaganda to read. I'm also really into obscure political punk, so I can point you to some bands and organizations to check out. First off, look into the social situation in Britain in the mid 70s when punk became big, as there was strong class division and rampant poverty--this is a basic thing that gets brought up anytime the origins of punk are talked about. The band Crass needs to be mentioned, because they are obscure enough that your teacher will be impressed, but popular enough that you can find a lot of info on them. They were an anarchist and anti-capitalist band from Britain back in the 70s and 80s, and were the first major punk band to really explore political issues from a true anarchist perspective (the Clash are also good as they were political, but they were more statist socialists and so I'm not as into them personally). Crass' songs "Banned from the Roxy," and "Do They Owe Us a Living?" are perfect to bring up. Basically the entire anarcho-punk movement is great to look into. More specifically, look into the traveling/festival movement in Britain, including bands like Zounds and the Mob, seeing as the Joads were transients as well. And the crust punk scene (both here in the States and elsewhere) is also good to look into, because many participants engage in squatting and traveling (often through train-hopping and hitch hiking). Some often look for work through WWOOFing (World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms), and are thus migrant agricultural workers. And the music all has strong political lyrics, with a strong anti-capitalist message, which is central to Grapes of Wrath. Look into Food Not Bombs, which is a decentralized organization that is typically made up of anarchists and/or punks and serves free food to the homeless, which is often obtained through dumpster diving (ie: living off excess food, much like the excess food being destroyed by companies in Grapes of Wrath).  Look into the British organization Class War as well. There is so much more I could try and think of, but I'm tired and this should be a good start. Feel free to message me if you need any help finding sources or more detail on anything.

LL95bMIlaa	Well at least we are subtle about it.|`|rJu4X6MDaa	The world isn't fair, I got used to that a long time ago anyway.<br>  <br>  And I'm a guy, I don't immediately stare at all the women i see. <br>  <br>  Don't be a perv, women are not just eye candy for you.|`|xztrmON2aa	Yea. Not all women look at mens chest/butt right away. Some of course. I look at the face first. then the body: 1st the chest then the booty. lol. gotta have them nice big booty. lol.|`|YlkotyRsaa	(Honestly laughed when I read this)<br>  <br>  We're awesome like that..?

I feel that it is inappropriate for a married man to look intently at a women who is not his wife, in a lustful way.  But if he is just looking because the person is right there in front of him.  Then that's normal, for all people look at those around them.  I look at other men, but not in a lustful way that will hurt my husbands feelings or in a way that can eventually get me in trouble.  This is because I love my husband and I am happy and content with our life.  I also don't like it if he talks about other woman's bodies in front of me or to others, because this is disrespectful to our marriage.  If a person wants to get married they need to understand that flirting and lusting after different people is going to end, that's just the way it is.  If people don't like it, then they should not get married or commit to another.<br>  Plain and simple.  Sometimes Men need to see that the reason why Women call them pigs is because, many Women have been hurt to many times by certain Men.  If a guy really loves a girl and visa versa, they both should remain faithful and loyal to each other.  So that no one gets hurt.|`|4MJEWCjiaa	I don't care if men look at my boobs...I'll still look at men's butts!!!|`|l0oDymHYaa	Hi Dear<br>  <br>  The first thing women look at is the PIG|`|NLwfMSJWaa	just browsing<br>  dont mind me..
Gslf19Uvaa	you just have to surround yourself with good people, and cry out to God. those things will gradually help you. <br>  <br>  i didn't have it as bad as you...but my parents have been divorced since i was 5 and i've had family problems for as long as i can remember. some days i get the feeling of screaming "if you only knew how fake this smile was"...but things always get better. they will :)|`|BKacbxmiaa	I smile too but it's mainly to keep people from asking me what's wrong.|`|BqHEeYA4aa	get some family counselling if ur parents are also willing to admit they didnt treat u right. if not, i know there would be tons of ppl who are ur true friends and will treat u right and give an actual reason to be happy. be around ppl who treat u right, treat urself right, and u will smile for reals
lthwx9YLaa	I agree with you as well, i am also 20.  I think that the music is getting crappier...but it may jsut be our old ears...we grew up listening to blink and sum 41 and pearl jam **** like that...the style of the music has changed a bit since then so it may just be like how our parents prefer their old tunes sounds and we prefer our early 90's tunes sounds|`|2k8TEiRtaa	I've been around and I also think todays music sucks. Anybody can make an album these days.And you don't have to be in tune. A computer program can take the pitch up to perfection.I remember the good old days when the music was real. The Rock Classics are my favorite because I remember hearing the songs on FM radio. They used Tape recorders instead of digital recorders up to the early 90's.. What you hear is reality. Not fixed music.|`|87deabd3c525e7aca518d4cbf44e4df0aa	Nope. I like a lot of today's music, even some of the mainstream stuff, like The Strokes and The White Stripes. Perhaps you should look past the mainstream. There's tons of good modern stuff hiding under there. =]|`|qHruRg8yaa	i agree with most of that.  i'm only fifteen, but i completely understand where you're coming from. to me, everything just sounds the same. if im listening to something, it has to have some emotion in it. i listen to a lot of alternative and classic rock, for that reason.|`|CHPuw61Uaa	I think popular mainstream music has always been disliked by those who take music more seriously than the average person. You chew out today's mainstream pop acts, perhaps with some justification, but are you comparing them to the easily-forgotten chart-topping commercial bubblegum pop of yesterday, or to bands which have gotten recognized and remembered by music lovers for their putative artistic value? If the latter, well, of course today's music is going to look like it pretty much sucks. However, I strongly suspect that there is a crop of currently unrecognized music that subsequent generations will recognize as classic.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I don't really care much anymore because the internet and portable music players make it possible to listen to just about any recorded music. Thus I don't care if the latest music is stupid. There's plenty of older stuff to listen to.

3u57MeUOaa	honestly there is no telling what was going on in kurt's head he is a complex character but i went to songfacts and this is what i got:<br>  <br>  Kurt Cobain, Nirvana's frontman and the song's author, claimed that this song was inspired by a television report of children suffering from cancer. However, many believe it was really written about his shaky but passionate relationship with his wife, Courtney Love. The lyrics do tend towards this latter interpretation, since they seem to concern themselves with an unstable romance between two individuals. It's worth noting that the lyrics mention Pisces and Cancer, Cobain's and Love's respective astrological signs. Love, after their second meeting sent a small heart-shaped box, containing, among other things, a doll's head, to his hotel room. This is believed to have inspired the song's title. Cobain and Love both shared a love and fascination of dolls.
fabhI1cSaa	My girlfriend is the only one I fantasize about. When I was younger it was a different story...................|`|grifjdr0aa	fantasies myazz, they just go phuck em.|`|o0Badlndaa	It varies but we all have them|`|lILfQh6xaa	You bet i look. Im married, not dead. Do i have fantasies. Hell ya. I have them like anyother guy. I dont necessarily picture having sex with her, at least not initially. I just check her out to start with. Look at the hair, if i can see them, the eyes, and the face. Her figure. How she carries herself. I do a good job at using my peripherals. LOL! I dont think we have control over the initial look or fantasy. But let me also say this after i made myself look like a dog. I think some women WANT to be looked at like that, or else they wouldnt dress the way they do sometimes. They want the attention. So i just give her what she is wanting.|`|nooi0ldjaa	just because a guy has a lady he likes doesn't mean he doesn't think ;)|`|9EkFrApiaa	My fiance said no...he might admire her looks but he isn't fantasizing about her sexually.|`|xESvfzQAaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  No<br>  <br>  Yes<br>  <br>  Yes<br>  <br>  Few moments<br>  <br>  Whenever a cute girl is seen.|`|S01zIagOaa	Not necessarily. Trying to picture myself having sex with every attractive woman I see in LA would be a lot of hard work for literally nothing. Also, if you've seen one attractive and naked woman you've basically seen them all. So nothing new there.<br>  <br>  Men and women have control over a great many things but in the end we are human. There are going to be some days where you think about sex with random people and months could go by without a sexual thought. There are simply too many factors involved to answer definitively.|`|Cp6ACouDaa	Damn you make us sound like were some kind of out of control sex freaks........... No I dont picture myself having sex with random Beautiful woman I see. Id never go to the mall if that were the case.<br>   If Ive been dating a woman and haven't had sex with her then mmmm yeah Im sure Id be wondering about that, but not random woman I find attractive...<br>  If Im getting feelings like your describing I would approach her and attempt to spark a conversation.|`|KhPJIyXhaa	I am a married woman and I have sexual fantasies about other men. I wouldn't dare cheat on my hubby and our marriage is great, but I do fantasize about other men. I can't help it. I imagine that it is the same for men.|`|V5K66Xb4aa	it depends on the mood youre in and how long its been since having sex. it also depends on how good looking the woman is. there are way too many factors to really get a standard. i dont think its something that anyone has control over men and women do this.|`|Z55OptjDaa	Don't women ever fantasize about other men too?|`|4dXcZhuTaa	yeah but women fantasize too.<br>  <br>  silly girl|`|spXPpyP0aa	no|`|7zXZpv8iaa	Attraction is subconscious. If your mans having fantasies, its not something he can help. keep that in mind.<br>  <br>  Also, when you see an attractive woman, even if your not in a committed relationship they aren't instantly naked in our eyes. That would be too awesome.<br>  <br>  We admire their figure, and move one. If your single you potentially flirt with them. If your committed, you dont, unless your a slimeball.<br>  <br>  That simple.<br>  <br>  And if your replaying to this, and you hit on girls while your committed, yes, im implying your a POS.|`|VsaEOX9vaa	Whew! That's a lot of questions!<br>  <br>  When I first see a woman that looks attractive to me, I first look at her face, then down to her breasts, then my eyes go down to her waist, hips, stomach and legs. Yes, I admire her form.<br>  <br>  I usually try to imagine her without clothes and of course, I then fantasize about making love with her.<br>  <br>  The fantasy can last for 10 minutes or 10 weeks or even longer!<br>  <br>  For the normal male, no it's not something that he has control over. It's natural, it's the selection process that is built into us through our genes. Males look for a woman with a body that looks as if it will produce strong healthy children. The hips, waist and bottom, then the breasts, because the child needs to be well-fed.<br>  <br>  Not sure why men look at the legs unless we think of the treasure that lies at the top. That's all that I can think of. But it's all part of the selection process. Women do it too, of course, and many women don't even realize that they are looking at men's bodies and the crotch area because it's the selection for fathering her babies.|`|jlXCnN7Uaa	First of all I am not gay but i don't find any girls apart from my relatives attractive. I seriously had enough of them and kept my focus on something else I want to achieve and I don't think about any girls for a second. Even if I see them i don't bother thinking. I can wait or be independent for the ever. But i got a question for you, when you see a attractive man does it turn you on and the things you said previously ?<br>  Please reply i'm begging you|`|jJjoZ3zfaa	it is something that most men have control over but tend to give in, I personally have no need to do this because I dont need to, why would I? I have a beautiful GF who I am committed to and who is perfect in every way imaginable. Guys like that are no better than a dog who would hump someones leg raw|`|YJAlNJq1aa	well if its a hot slutty girl we think about sex if its a pretty non slutty girl maybe just her naked and i don't have control over it to begin with but then i realize i'm doing it and they usually only last aslong as shes there and i can't do it for too long if i'm out in public because i'll have to stand up sooner or latter but this is just me all guys are different|`|dIVbe8cQaa	i have no problem fantasizing only about the woman i love and no, other women don't interest me sexually at all.<br>  <br>  i guess that makes me gay, huh?|`|hwDtWCAjaa	i will look at the girl and think shes pretty and forget about it and don't fantasies about it the only girl i have fantasies about is the girl im with|`|AA12022635	Yes to all.  Last time I checked, picturing yourself with another woman is NOT cheating.  Acting on it is.|`|rmziCueQaa	Fantasy of girl is important in times men should be pleased it is important that woman are please man.|`|CTaKjwDTaa	of course you think about, but you know that you will never do it.<br>  <br>  you can only picture but not act upon|`|NaW6epGPaa	Fantasy to my natural ***. He better not otherwise there will be some serious problems. I'll WHOOP HIS *** if I ever catch my man dreaming about another woman.|`|dPicgCgwaa	Yeah fo sho, we think of all that stuff, cuz we're like that.<br>  It's the way men are programmed.|`|gkVd0encaa	yes! i try to control it but my mind takes over!<br>  i do fantasize about other women... but dont cheat...<br>  so whats wrong with that?|`|q7SQ6Tgfaa	they last for 20 minutes..happens once every couple of months|`|985aNLmoaa	all the time. 24/7|`|cBMcKNHEaa	One can only dream.

The songs are very different styles from each other, too, one being rock and the other slow acoustic. Just so you know. Enjoi!|`|PCMcxXgbaa	I'm surprised no one has said "so cold" yet, i love that song.|`|39Ti4GrFaa	"Breathe" is a good one.<br>  <br>  "until the end" also.<br>  <br>  "You"<br>  <br>  I like those deeper ones!

p0bQGSbaaa	i know brian "head" welch left korn to begin his path as a christian.  he wrote a pretty cool book called: save me from myself.  it was about his childhood, his love for guitar, creating and his career in korn, his personal life, why he left the band and his path towards spirituality and God.  dont think j. davis became a devout christian though.|`|WvEjSnoJaa	From what Brian "Head" Welsh has said about his life, it spun out of control. I agree that KoRn has never been as good as they were with him seeing as though they were my favorite band for many years since '94. He couldn't stay with KoRn as their lifestyle together was different, too much much temptation for drugs & what not. Also Jonathon Davis' lyrics aren't very conducive to living a life of faith. That was one thing that started getting annoying about KoRn, J.D. upp'd his profanity which is just lame lyric writing as swearing is just mindless filler. But as I've found out 4 myself...ya can't stay evil forever...it catches up to you in a big way! ;-)|`|E5HAzKYHaa	Dont think so....but a Korn guitarist became a born again christian and left the band.|`|Jph6y9viaa	who is he and how should i know why or what?|`|k39bNUgeaa	I haven't heard of him doing it<br>  <br>  But Brian "head" welch quit the band to become christian. Now Korn isn't as good without him in it.|`|bltgAc9Maa	I don't know. But if one of the members really became a born-again Christian like everybody else is saying here, why did he have to leave Korn? Can't he be a Christian and still be with the band? Just because you're a rocker, doesn't mean that you have to lead an un-Christian way of life. You can still be a Christian and a rocker at the same time. But whatever his decision is, I wish him the best.

ZyGyDLsDaa	A Little Princess (1995)<br>  starring  Liesel Matthews, Eleanor Bron, Liam Cunningham, Rusty Schwimmer, Arthur Malet, Vanessa Lee Chester (of "Lost World: Jurassic Park")<br>  IMDb synopsis:<br>  When her father enlists to fight for the British in the first world war, young Sara Crewe goes to New York to attend the same boarding school her late mother attended. She soon clashes with the severe headmistress, Miss Minchin, who attempts to stifle Sara's creativity and sense of self- worth. Sara's belief that "every girl is a princess" is tested to the limit when word comes that her father was killed in action and his estate has been seized by the British government. <br>  Here's the movie trailer:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4emTTgIm5U" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4emTTgIm...</a><br>  Here's Part 1 on YouTube, which I believe has the complete film:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTa3V2AdfNk&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTa3V2Adf...</a><br>  <br>  Based on Frances Hodgson Burnett's novel, there are several versions, including Shirley Temple's "The Little Princess" (1939). The earliest filmed version is 1917's "The Little Princess". Most versions use "The", while several, including a TV miniseries, start the title with "A".<br>  <br>  Burnett also wrote the novel "The Secret Garden", which has been filmed a number of times and was made into a Broadway musical.|`|f5821d0eb9486d7586aa71ba68cdecc8aa	A Little Princess|`|7a4e85774d9b26f6d449d47e0beca2b5aa	The movie you are desrcibing is a remake of the Little Princess ( there have been about 6 remakes total) with the best at least in my opinion being the one with Shirley Temple.|`|d55D0Ci4aa	The Little Princess - there are two versions, the first one is with Shirley Temple....|`|AkBx09UGaa	A Little Princess<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113670/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113670/</a>

n5eH9cYdaa	uhh i can't stand slutty cyrus<br>  w/ her chickmunk teeth<br>  && loud hillybilly voice<br>  && her famewhoree bf justin GASton<br>  lol:]|`|k39bNUgeaa	I don't like her<br>  Never have. Never will<br>  <br>  I don't like her one hit wonder father either|`|R0Whhjo0aa	i think shes cool and all those stupid mistakes shes done are normal cause if you never make any mistakes your gonna end up being boring cough cough *selena gomez*and we shouldn't pretend like we are never going to make mistakes cause we will and nobody cusses us out worldwide when we make them<br>  <br>  i think shes cool shes young shes gonna learn<br>  oh yeah and people if you hate her why do u care so much about her enough to call her names|`|OUo9J4i1aa	I like Miley Cyrus I think some her songs are Ok and really showcase her as a young girl with a lot of talent she's a much better role model for young girls then Paris Hilton or Lindsy Lohen or Britney Spears although Britneys starting to make a bit of a comeback.But c'mon give her a break she's just a human after all.|`|XjcER6zvaa	she is a wannabe pop star and movie star that never had any life lessons taught to her except ur rich and famous you can do anything|`|AA11707745	Umm...I think she's her daddy's little career revival. All in a nice miniature Marie Osmond package.|`|qGKANnYoaa	she's ok.<br>  honestly just starting to get a bit s***ty.|`|SZZkfVzbaa	*Clears throat*<br>  <br>  The *celebrity* Miley SEEMS like a stuck-up brat; that's HER image, and she brought that upon herself. <br>  However, the normal, 16 year-old Country girl is probably a really amazing person - It's just a shame that she's ruined her reputation by taking all those photos, and such. People are so quick to judge these days, which also makes it a ton worse.<br>  <br>  I think she's doing a good job at entertaining little kids. Hannah Montana is a pretty good show, but i'm sure it's much more fun for younger kids :)<br>  <br>  In a Nutshell, I think she's OK, but she could definitely do something to clean up her image a little bit. It's a real shame, cause she could have achieved so much more from her Career; right now she's only getting money, rather than Fans as well. From what I can see, she's losing more Fans everyday.<br>  <br>  I like Miley. <br>  <br>  ?M.|`|vJHkAWlsaa	- She really loves her job and she shows it by working her way to the top.<br>  - She looks at the bright sides of things<br>  - She is always true to herself and to her fans<br>  - She's helping unfortunate people through giving through her own charity.<br>  - She is really nice to her fans because when Miley's driver was already driving the limousine, some of her fans were screaming and want to take pics and autograph and you know what she did? She stopped the car and spent time with her fans. Haha, I find it cute. =))<br>  - She has great attitude about life.<br>  - She has good morals that teenagers can learn by in her interviews and even songs<br>  - She has picked herself back up after her scandals came up and even when a lot of people starts criticizing everything that she does xD.<br>  - She believes in God.<br>  - She is always an honest person - and that's what I find rare in Disney. I mean, seriously. Look around. I bet they would come up with some kind of crap when something's up with them.<br>  - After the scandals, she picked herself up and do what she did best.<br>  <br>  I really think she's a rolemodel. Because being a rolemodel doesn't constantly mean being 'perfect.' NO ONE is perfect and you CANNOT teach kids that, it would be IMPOSSIBLE and NONSENSE. She's teaching little kids to be NEAR PERFECT and to be TRUE TO THEMSELVES which I find really pleasing.|`|k23GYs9iaa	i used to like her. but i don't anymore. she was chewing gum with a board look on here face on the red carpet. she acts like everyone should bow at her feet, someone needs to slap the           out of her|`|4vka4Yb5aa	Reasons why i hate Miley Cyrus!<br>  -her music sucks!<br>  -She ruined Disney Channel!<br>  -Shes erking!|`|X5JGneopaa	well i have no reason to hate her because i dont know her but she seemed to make quite a lot of mistakes in the past year which made me not like her.|`|BEfhBLb9aa	she songs like she has a stuffy nose when she sings  especially on fly on the wall only famous because of her daddy|`|e27fe1a9205b53137b4cbd03b8a47947aa	A child in need of responsible adult guidance.|`|A1DgICqCaa	i do not like her at all<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ?dej?|`|b3ID1NbUaa	i know shes not the best singer, but quite a lot of her songs are actually really good for a teenager, especially Disney (cmon, LISTEN to aly&aj and tell me how bad miley is.....).<br>  <br>  she got the huge kick start needed from her dad, but she isnt FAMOUS for her dad, shes famous for Hannah Montana, which, as far as them kinda shows go, is actually pretty good, and shes not that bad an actor, could do with some improving, but shes not atrocious. And many famous people get kick starts from their parents to start their careers, even a lot of politians, so i dont see what the big deal is anyway, yes there are other people out there waiting to live their dreams...there always is, theres always gonna be, its not ewhat you know its who you, to get to the top you need contacts, miley has them, nothings going to change that ever.<br>  <br>  apart from that...she tries her hardest, she tries to do what she loves while having fun, and she gets pulled down for it, as far as I see shes just a fun loving random teenage girl, and she is a good role model-of course she does things she later regrets, but the way she aknoledges her mistakes, makes ammends as best as possible and moves on is GOOD, thats the best anyone can do, just because shes famous doesnt mean she has to lock herself in her room!<br>  <br>  all the stuff she does pple complain about, if anyone normal did it, no prob, but because its MILEY....<br>  <br>  so all in all, shes not the most original or the best, or the most talented, but she has her share of talent and drive, and people need to get off her back, she is put under enormous pressure.|`|3hChyHo9aa	im sorry people but this is a 16 year old girl who's trying to make her way into the adult world and nt only just into the adult world but breaking into hollywood and i think she's doing a darn good job. I think you guys should cut the poor kid some slack. she puts her heart into everything and she's doing what she wants with her life. if only more people her age new what they wanted to do with themselves or even put a single thought other than i think that guys cute or i dont wanna go to school cause no one likes me, they are into drugs n suffering from 'depression' i donno id rather miley be my kid anyday anyways i think ive said enough l8rs|`|zSP9dhCiaa	I don't watch her or listen to her, but from i hear shes not a bad person, and its good for young girls to look up to someone who's not a skank-bag, like Paris Hilton.<br>  <br>  So in my book, shes good to have around.|`|LZeta5niaa	SHE FAILS! I hate her so much. Bad voice.<br>  <br>  But her dad is okay.<br>  <br>  Best answer please.|`|XuK91PwKaa	She's young and naive. Attention whore. Rich and spoiled. Hate her. No talent at all.|`|Sdqwt6wqaa	dont like her at all<br>  period.|`|Cl6l0iABaa	i honestly think she is freakin annoying lol she is trying to be the next kelly clarkson and she isnt! loil
MsBoH20Iaa	yes you tune drums, but not to specific notes. you tune for the tone/sound you like. Start with a bass, a snare, a mount tom and a floor tom, high hats and a ride cymbal. Learn to play a small kit. learn the basics! If anyone tries to sell you more than that,  they are taking advantage of you. For example go and listen to Buddy Rich, Louis Bellson and Gene Krupa. After that you will start to understand where rock drumming came from. Then listen to John Bonham and you will understand what the term "groove" means. Have fun and good luck!|`|u0160kdXaa	Yes. But not often enough!<br>  <br>  If you can afford it you should get an electric kit. This way you can control the volume. I am sure your neighbors would appreciate that! Pus you can record with it better and make all sorts of noises.And they are easier to pack up and cart around when you get in a band.They are also easier to tune. but, generally you just tighten the heads by using your ear. If the head is too loose it goes *thud* instead of *boom* or *pop*. Trust me. you'll figure it out. Careful, it's addicting!<br>  A good starter kit is a 3 piece or 5 piece. TAMA is a reasonably priced acoustic kit.<br>  <br>  (And if you are really serious listen to some of Niel Pearts stuff on early "RUSH" cd's. or you tube it...)|`|A1DgICqCaa	dude seriously if you don't know any thing about a drum set in you want to play rock first you have to learn the basic getting on the drums in have skills all so you can not get on the drums in learn over night have somebody teach you how to play<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   ?dej?|`|3e79b8bcfddfe480c3a4116543712eb3aa	you have to tune it the first time, but you do not have to tune it every time you play.

Let's go back and get it from her.|`|kbxq8o9saa	i will cry like a baby!!!<br>     coz i'm not ur mommy.....<br>  <br>      MOM stop impersonating Dad!!!<br>  <br>  <br>      XD|`|Jy6dFXjVaa	First of all, my husband and I deal with a teenage son like this day in and day out. If we have the money and if it's something our son really needs or wants, we go ahead and buy it for him (such as a game for his PS3, a card for him to buy music for his Ipod, some new dress clothes he needs for a dance or for the school's Athletic Banquet). But if it's a large amount of money he's wanting us to spend on something that isn't a "gotta have item," then I tell him to make me a list. And when the next holiday or special ocassion comes around, then I'll buy what is on his list and he can have those items for his birthday or for Christmas gifts. <br>  <br>  So, if you said something like that to me, I'd tell you the same thing I tell our son. Wait until a special ocassion rolls around and if it doesn't break the bank, I'll try to get what you want, within reason. If it's an unreasonable amount of money (like a car), I'd tell ya 'no way, get a job to help pay for this and then we'll talk about it again after you've saved up some money.' <br>  <br>  I'm not unreasonable at all but I'm not a total push-over either. Nor do I enjoy being taken advantage of. It would just depend on how much that something nice from a good store is gonna cost me and you'd have to give me a good reason to justify why you need it right now before I'd buy it. If it's something I know you need or really want (and it's not an ungodly amount of money), then I might go ahead and buy it.<br>  <br>  My hubby and I have to lookout for our future, put money in our son's college fund, buy his necessities (which aren't cheap)  and we've also agreed to pay for our son's college education. But he's talking about becoming a lawyer, so that's SEVEN years minimun of college. All we have agreed to is four years of college. We didn't sign up to pay for a Master's Degree, Law School or to buy him a new car. Our oldest son finished his last two years of college on grants that racked up to $40,000.00. And nine years later, he's back in college getting his Master's Degree. The company he's working for is paying 80% and he's having to pay 20% of the costs.<br>  <br>  We're not unreasonable parents at all when it comes to buying things for our kids. But once you're out of college, working and on your own, that's pretty much it, as far as financial support goes. We've made it this long using the 'make us a list' rule, so we're not gonna back down now!  There just comes a time when Mom and Dad have to bow out of their kids lives and let them try to succeed on their own.|`|VagRIJlEaa	See, if you called me mom then I'd feel special and probably buy you something.<br>  <br>  ...BUT! You just referred to me as "you" and that makes me said and I would hold my head up high and try to walk away without crying.|`|WBKpSl5jaa	huh...im confused|`|klhB1ijwaa	i'd say wtf my mom isn't ur mom... lol|`|pqMXfFEXaa	ok. sears here we come!|`|grifjdr0aa	I'd say you're as crazy as hell cuz my mother is deaf as a board and ain't about to strike up a conversation with a stranger cuz she hates people worse than I do.|`|H9gmJYdmaa	You're only getting the cheap condoms, kid.

So, no i don't kiss my family but my family does.|`|e9SMMGOkaa	Lol really?

AA11375099	I am poor.  My wife has breast cancer and she was the main wage earner.  Fighting cancer is very expensive, even with insurance.  There are a lot of expenses they do not cover.<br>  <br>  My wife has not worked for over six months.  We have not gone to food banks yet, but I have sold a lot of my personal items to put food on the table and to pay for parking at the hospital.<br>  <br>  I still give what little I have to people that are worse than I am.  Sometimes a few dollars really can help somebody out.  I used to give more, so the ones that I do give to must have a need greater than my own.<br>  <br>  But if it came down to it, I would be forced to not give if my wife needed something like medicine, or food to eat or parking paid for.  So, it is very rare that I give now.  But things will change and i will give something to those that have need.<br>  <br>  I believe even a few dollars can help when you have nothing.|`|bW6NpTXdaa	yes.|`|IqhD4JCCaa	HEy man if you get high enough"<br>  <br>  <br>  Yea go TROLLS|`|u2lYbPT2aa	Yes!! I have alot of compassion for the poor...there are many, many poor people struggling, trying to raise a family!! Here in California, the rents are astronomical, and the prices of homes, are off the page!!<br>  People have to pay their rent, utilities, feed, and cloth their children...and the kids here, expect the top of the line, designer clothes!!...and the list goes on and on.....and it never ends!! So, there are more people struggling than we could ever imagine!!  So many people here, are losing their homes, because they just can not keep up with the payments!!  When you speak of the poor, people automatically think of the homeless!! Somehow they have the wrong idea of being homeless!! Anyone of us, at the snap of a finger, could become homeless...so people should not point fingers!!!<br>  Thanks for your question!!

I live on my Soc Sec but I give $5 from time to time to people who are poorer than I am. I also feed a few that are my friends too.<br>  But if you really care you can do stuff that doesn't cost you any money like helping out at a shelter to feed the homeless. Baby sit some kids so the mother can go on a job interview. If you think about it you can find some thing to do to help those who have fallen on bad times.|`|FSyaAnuKaa	Not really. That may make me shallow, but oh well.|`|AA10415600	of course.  i believe in the end that you will be judged by how you treat the weak, the people who need help, people who can not help themselves|`|eRVRWwkBaa	Yes.

Even though I haven't ever ditched, I technically have because my Physics teacher is a dumbshit and marked me absent one random Thursday.  This happened again a month later in my last class of the day.  I said I was here but the substitute teacher ignored me (apparently) and marked me absent.  So technically I have skipped school 2 times.  I just never got the benefit of being gone from ******* school because of it (only the bad mark on my record).|`|AA11136495	Only a college class, because i didnt want to walk half a mile in the rain, and because i got up too late to get there for most of the class anyways xD|`|szV2vew4aa	We called it ditching, but yea. at least twice a week. <br>  <br>  but we paid for it, its not worth it.|`|rvoqZiRJaa	Yup.

0KM5ANZbaa	tell her to be herself, don't try to impress anybody, you're only truly your happiness when you stay true to yourself. maybe she can get a makeover, not to impress anybody, but to feel better about herself and find that she can look better because everybody has the potential to look good. Tell her to be confident and not care about boyfreinds, because when you are confident, you look good and have that confident vibe and then guys will suddenly be attracted to that confidence. But most importantly, just be yourself and have fun.<br>  <br>   Best of luck! :)|`|eHjbv241aa	ask her to have plenty of fresh air, smile a lot and make it a habit to say Hi to many a day. ask her to have more friends. she can adopt a pet(dog)<br>  <br>  I want to be friendly with her. will she write to me?

z2Omhpm1aa	This is coming from a girl so it might sound a little in her favor. From what you told me I would assume that she had never thought about it before and was a bit unnerved. Maybe she just needed time to sort herself out so that she can give you a true answer. It's hard on you to wait but she might need the space. It she doesn't comment on it within a couple of days ask her how she feels.

There was a picture of Jesus Christ he had put there, and he had just transferred it from my parents' main bedroom when I was about six.  My dad's door to the bathroom is ALWAYS open, and so I always want to close it at night when he snores.  Then I see the picture of Jesus and I get scared because I'm thinking," Oh my gosh he's watching meee!" So I'd just run and jump in bed, feeling somewhat relieved.<br>  <br>  Of course, as I grew older I became aware that there was nothing to be afraid of a portrait of Jesus Christ. =P  I have another more smaller replica in my bedroom today, and it always reminded me of my former fear. =]<br>  <br>  ts4everr|`|lkdFNa6daa	that's so cute ! aww<br>  <br>  When i was Young i had a very similar fear except it wwas mirrors, id feel like there was a huge group of people i knew who were watching me as if i were a movie..  <br>  <br>  I obviously dont think that anymore, but i always have this fear there are little secret hidden cameras spying on me.. <br>  <br>  Even in public change rooms or bathroom stalls !<br>  <br>  <br>  But theres a video on youtube i think where these people bought a VCR and they opened it up and there was a hidden camera in it..<br>  <br>  I thought that was the scariest thing ! <br>  <br>  anyways, thats my storyy haha<br>  <br>  :)|`|Xs4edpgXaa	LMAO...oh man...i used to do that when i was littler, i had all these posters and magazine pics on my wall, and i would get all weirded out when i had to change and would go into the b-room too...LOL..that is so awesome...i totally forgot about when i used to do that...oh memories ^___^|`|MpYIFWe7aa	that's not fear.,,,,that's an imagination,,,but yeah I know that kind of problem,,,haha|`|xPeIvywdaa	no<br>  <br>  nice imagination|`|gaVhPGWhaa	you could take the posters down|`|E6WWBEM2aa	yes, but i just cover the eyes with Post It's.....|`|DKNvQ1ftaa	omgosh so when i used to go visit my uncle he had these pictures of indian tribes in his bathroom and it was three men in loin-clothes starring at you....it was soooo creepy.

They are made for that use as well. if you like you can use tampons in the day and sleep in pads. However if you have a heavy period then it may be a bit messy throughout the night. If you have light cycles then sleep in pads if you are heavy, go with a super tampon. can't harm you....you'll be fine|`|e654790b992c67caf75978a2190563b1aa	I asked my doctor when I first considered sleeping with a tampon when young and she said it was perfectly fine as long as you put in a new one before sleeping and changing it immediately when waking up. It's no necessarily bad, that is it you sleep for maximum of 8 hrs... more then that and it could harm you after some time.<br>  <br>  Be safe! ^_^|`|jKDZlgMiaa	Actually, the directions say you can leave it in for up to 8 hrs. I used to think, well then why can't we sleep in them? Then they started saying you can sleep in them.<br>  <br>  Just follow whatever it says in the box.|`|KVzBqWhvaa	You're not supposed to leave it in longer than 8hrs I think. If you do you'll get TSS and you really wouldn't want that. I read about it and you could die and you have to get shots on your spine which hurt like..|`|Am54a7c0aa	Yeah, it's really not recommended to sleep with a tampon in.|`|w1IF79vJaa	umm that wouldnt be good. you can get poisoned. use a pad instead at night.|`|uIIvMi68aa	i couldnt help myself|`|EPki0rwgaa	lol. I knew I would regret clicking on this question..|`|NAy7lfxkaa	no. the maximum time to leave one in is about six hours or so.<br>  so it's pretty much okay to sleep with one.<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  <br>  TSS only occurs if you leave it in there for a LONG time. One or two days, even.|`|08zR9MJOaa	no, not bad.  They say don't have one in for more than 8 hours.  Just make sure you put a new one in before you go to bed and then again when you are up.  Really, it's no big deal.|`|WKgvwCNZaa	You can, but don't leave it there for too long off course. Although ... why use tampons when sleeping when you can use pads?|`|6npsRIzUaa	if you listen to these answers saying you can, i'm gonna lawl when you have a disease.|`|BQHWdOjMaa	yeah it's really really bad you can get tts <br>  just be safe and put on a pad|`|N5WDRo3Faa	sorta. i guess u could sleep with one but i dont preffer it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Plus ro me, it hurts to sleep with one.|`|4n6iXf13aa	eeewww|`|zD7bHkSyaa	well yes its bad...i know someone who does (naughty) and they have never got that disease thingo.<br>  i would never do it. i'm too paranoid.|`|0LBNKveLaa	I sleep with a pad, try it.

jAmAQj97aa	The Beatles had four vocalists.  John and Paul took care of most of the lead vocals, while George sang lead mostly on the songs he wrote, and Ringo was given one lead vocal on each album.<br>  <br>  John formed the band.  He was half of the greatest songwriting duo in history.  He played rhythm guitar, keyboards, and some lead guitar.<br>  <br>  Paul played bass, keyboards, and occasionally drums.  He was the other half of that great songwriting team.
Y4Ye3OLOaa	I actually had never heard of Chris Brown before|`|8kUI95M9aa	Yes. If it's good music I listen to it. We go through our lives never meeting the artists we listen to. I bet you we wouldn't even like some of them if we got to know them personally, not everybody can be liked. Good music is good music :)|`|plOBKNy4aa	if i like the music and connect with it, then yeah.  People make mistakes and who are we to really judge if we weren't there to see how everything happened.  Maybe the girl had it coming.. I really don't know anything about what happend, but if you dig the tunes don't stop listening.|`|stUY1k7Uaa	Yes, but I don't take the lyrics seriously. The lyrics are not an accurate reflection of who the artist is, so it's like listening to lies. Therefore, I just try to enjoy the beat and apply the lyrics elsewhere.|`|4d2a746b2c406b888ee53ccce2cd95e0aa	i dont hear chris browns music no more, i hear rihannas tho when its on the radio i dont skipped it..   time heals things so that is all i got to say...<br>  <br>  <br>  oow what is with all the thumbs down????/ huh!! HUH?!?!?!? got a problem with that!|`|nTinkRxiaa	A musicians background means nothing when compared to the quality of the music they produce, in my opinion. If they're good I'll listen, if they're not I won't|`|4TqadRJYaa	Yes, i listen to the music for the music, not considering what the artist has done.<br>  My only exception: Michael Jackson|`|3PrvLMwlaa	I still listen to elliott despite he committed the ultimate sin|`|JYPrhKrgaa	No, i think it is bad.<br>  <br>  i dont know why, i not it aint but i just feel bad by supporting their music.|`|2p55hLjYaa	yea i still listen to the music...i was listenin to chris brown the other day..|`|0yVwW7CHaa	I still listen to his music, when I hear his music the first thing that pops into my head is the beat up pic of Rhianna|`|1WNOQXVlaa	I still listen to Forever by Chris Brown, and I still dont like Rhianna.|`|Qy6nOZtxaa	yes. i don't care either, i just like his music, i dont really care about his personal life.|`|fZ38PPgSaa	i agree but most of his music sucked anyways|`|465i8NWfaa	hellz yeah<br>  <br>  i listen to michael jackson too|`|NmBjSCOyaa	i listen to fall out boy every day even though pete wentz raped my sister|`|hDm1yKgDaa	To me, music is music. When you listen to their music, you don't necessarily hear what they're doing or did wrong (that is unless their lyrics specifically address what they did wrong); all you hear is the music.|`|ex5MUFP8aa	Yes I was listening to Poppin few minutes ago|`|37d59d30b548b7eff503880ca147a26aaa	I mean this artist are people just like anyone else. They have pissy days just like we do...so that is life and what they do in their personal lives has nothing to do with their talent as an artist.|`|xXyy51Efaa	Yeah, hey, they may be bad, but their music isn't!<br>  <br>  smile for the camera|`|frwlypDWaa	Beating up somebody smaller and weaker is somewhere near the top of my list of despicable acts, so no, I wouldn't listen to his music. For me, his inexcusable bevavior would get in the way of his artistry.|`|HI0oQriqaa	can you give me the names of some hip hop or rap artists who don't smoke pot and do bad things? yes i listen to bad acting musicians and never know what they do. the chris brown thing was just for publicity.|`|Kkxq4Tisaa	music is music...his leisure time does not entertain me...<br>  <br>  besides...CB is a pretty boy fag<br>  <br>  i listen to hip hop krs1 nas guru az<br>  <br>  not even michael jackson was gayer than CB and MJ is CB's big fan....|`|8yE2sYGeaa	I still laugh at Michael Richards in seinfeld, despite his tirade.<br>  <br>  What they have done now does not detract what they did then|`|KH9bbeCNaa	i listen to Michael Jackson|`|tWePoJYNaa	Yeah sure. I personally don't like Chris Brown's music at all, so that lead to me disliking him after the whole Rhianna thing. But if I liked his music I'd still listen to it. His music is business, his life is personal.|`|kkO87h0Xaa	I think it's actually Rihanna who took most of the attention out of this. A lot of people are sympathizing with her, and I guess the best way to pay homage to her bravado is to listen to DISTURBIA.|`|f5RzWf1Gaa	i dont looks at them for their personality-if i like teir music i liek their music-i still llisten to michael jackson :D|`|6NEPcZFfaa	O.o I love Chris Brown, I like to listen to them together.|`|wCXY3MJ2aa	Yes I do.<br>  I still like MJ's music.|`|ea207ed5b6ef75b8f1362932a6abf174aa	I dont care what they do in their personal time.|`|vMiX1lL7aa	yeah i still listen to chris brown..<br>  i dont like him very much. but his music is good so who cares|`|UwFb8cleaa	yeah. its like if bill gates went to jail should all of us stop using windows?
eNj4bbKBaa	i saw it when i was 14 or 15 and i was fine. personally, i would wait a little longer to let her watch it. i guess it depends on if she knows all about the birds and the bees or not. if you are all cool and she knows how things work and why, then i don't see a real problem with it as long as she can come to you with any questions she has.|`|mBHQEzd1aa	I thought it was a very good movie and very, very, tastefully done.  The underwater scenes were out of this world.  I think a 12 year old could probably watch it.  I never considered it porn.|`|676fffa1d033bd7fc45c4eae89d1f268aa	MPAA Rating: R <br>  that movie is not for a 12 year old|`|0BoDF6iBaa	I watched it for the first time when I was around that age.  I didn't think the sex parts were porn-like.  The few "sexy" parts aren't graphic, it focuses on the love story aspect.  It helped me understand that sex leads to babies and Brooke Shield looked like having a baby was the worst experience ever and definitely something I didn't want to do for a very long time.<br>  <br>  I think 12 is a good age to watch it.<br>  She's at the age where she'll understand most of it, and if she doesn't understand some parts, she'll talk to you and you can tell her how it is.
to6JW3yFaa	You said that this Aqua guy is just ur crush right? So u guys r just friends at the moment and not dating. I think that any sign goes great together when it comes to being just friends, but when it comes to dating... people tend to change.<br>  <br>  Aquas are great friends to everyone. They're really friendly, outgoing, talkative, kind, intersting, etc. But when it comes to them in relationships, it's a completely different story. They act more aloof and cold in order to not open up too fast too soon. And when ur in a relationship with someone, u expect more than just a friendship... especially us water signs. We love intimacy, and being told sweet nothings to.<br>  <br>  Aquas unfortunately dont do that as much. They're main thing is friends first, so they may treat u more like a friend rather than a lover. This is definately hard for us water signs... especially Scorpios. Im a Pisces and I go fine with my current Aqua bf because Im a mutable sign and it's a lot easier for me to adjust to people's personalitiy and needs. So it doesnt bother me TOO much when he's acting distant and needs his space, because when he's finally being a lot more intimate... it makes it that much sweeter. Plus Im thankfully verrrrrry patient haha.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, Scorpios are a fixed sign just like Aquas. Therefore it makes it hard to change ur mind and be more patient with people, just like it is for Aquas. U want intimacy, he wants independence. Ur emotional, he likes to be emotionally detached. Ur stubborn, he's stubborn. Haha it's gonna be really hard for u guys to compromise. Plus Scorpios are known for being really possesive and jealous in relationships, and Aquas HATE being controled like that. Haha I would know, my guy got really annoyed when I was just pretending to be jealous. Stubborn a** lol.<br>  <br>  So basically what Im tryinggg to say is that the relationships people have as friends and lovers is different. U may find him to be really compatible with u now cause u guys are really great together as friends... but when it comes down to it as a real relationship, u two may have two very different styles. Scorpios want unconditional passion, and Aquas want unconditional friendship. This WILL annoy u. It annoys me too to some extent. But thankfully Im mutable so it's a lot easier for me to adjust. And thankfully my guy is showing more intimacy cause he knows how much it means to me.<br>  <br>  But even though it says Aquas and Scorpios dont go that well together, that doesnt mean it wont. If both of u understand each others difference and needs, and are willing to compromise... then there is no doubt that ur relationship can last. Good luck!!|`|aRMsI01jaa	I always thorght that Aquarius and Scorpios didnt get on either!

kbmzgdFBaa	Tienes razon.pero tambien debes tomar en concideracion, que a principios de la decada de los 60's la tecnologia magnetofonica habia alcanzado un gran avance logrando poder grabar en cuatro canales lo que conocemos como sonido estereofonico., definitivamente esto le dio grandes ventajas a los musicos ya que no habia que grabar una cancion usando tanto los instrumentos como las voces, sino que grabavan por canales y despues mezclavan todos los instrumentos y las voces, lo que le daba un sonido nitido y con gran amplitud.<br>  <br>  Si te refieres al tipo de musica y no al sonido en si. creo que se debe a la gran cantidad de musicos y cantantes que invadieron las decadas de los 60's y 70's lo que le dio una gran variedad a los ritmos de Rock desde lo mas bullicioso hasta los mas harmonico.<br>  Pero como todo tiene un final esta gran variedad  musical fue disminullendo paulatinamente hasta llegar hoy en dia donde los grupos que resaltan ya son escasos. por esa razon todos estos ritmos de de esasa decadas se escuchan tanto como cuando empesaron.<br>  <br>  Para que el Rock se escuche como una musica de antano habria que tener una nueva invasion musical que gustara tanto como el Rock pero siendo totalmente otro ritmo. posiblemente llegue a pasar. pero cuando? eso solo el tiempo lo dira|`|bt6dccT0aa	pss de los grandes del rock, son pink floyd, que su musika jamas pasa de moda, bryan adams, queen, beatles, ummm, chicago, pues para mi estos<br>  kamara|`|e5d38625df282b96d5ba3a40637f20c1aa	arriba el rock led zeppelin yeah wolfmother yeah <br>  chin a s m el regeton|`|ebd3d9ab60b281b5cbc8d1d89591317faa	Estoy totalmente de acuerdo contigo.

q4BZsqGwaa	If you're buying a guitar as a beginner, you want to look for two main things when buying a guitar: Quality, and Price. There are some good brands out there that offer a lot of quality for a lower price.<br>  <br>  The main things you'll want to look for are 1) Sound: Does it sound good to you? Is this something you'll enjoy hearing when you play it? 2) Feel: It has to have that special "feel" to it. Most of the time when I walk into a guitar store and pick up a few guitars, there will be one with that special "feel" to it. As you play more you'll start to discover what you like more in the feel of a guitar.<br>  <br>  For a start you'll want to look at body size and neck size. Is the body something you can easily sit down and play? I've always been told that if you can't sit and play the guitar, don't consider buying it. This usually rules out all those crazy shapes like stars and axes. When you're looking at a neck you want to make sure it's straight and easy to move your hand around on. Some necks are thicker and some are thinner. This is also a personal preference.<br>  <br>  The next thing you want to look at is quality. A lot of cheaper, beginners guitars aren't made out of the best materials and don't have the best warranties. If you're buying an electric guitar, a good way to judge the quality of the wood is to sit down and play it "unplugged." If it produces a rich, smooth sound that you can hear without strumming hard or loudly, then most likely it will produce a good quality sound while plugged into an amplifier.<br>  <br>  Some will tell you that learning to play on an acoustic guitar is harder, but will make you a better player. This is because it typically requires more hand strength and will build up callouses on your fingers quicker than an electric guitar would.<br>  <br>  Good luck and happy buying!|`|4aghXokeaa	i recommend gibson or ibenez <br>  IBANEZ  <a href="http://ibanez.com/" rel="nofollow">http://ibanez.com/</a><br>  <br>  les pauls are ALWAYS great very popular and a favorite<br>  THHESE ARE GIBSONS<br>  <br>  or something simple like the G-400<br>  <a href="http://www2.gibson.com/Products/Electric-Guitars/SG/Epiphone/G-400.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www2.gibson.com/Products/Electric...</a><br>  <br>  I THINK THEY HAVE GREAT SOUND|`|NxLmvKtJaa	Buy yourself a Fender acoustic guitar.

bzzUBEmQaa	To be entirely honest (and I know this probably isn't what you want to hear), it sounds very amateurish and lacking in creativity. The drums don't change much, nor do they fit well with the rest of the track. A lot of the synths brought in are lacking the depth and warmth needed for a solid track (That's not to say that you can't have a track with a cold synth, but when the track in general sounds like that, it's no good). This track is also building layers in a predictable manner.<br>  <br>  Aside from production quality the arps and synth notes sound reasonable when layered together; they might even sound great had the production quality been better. But like I said, they need lots of life injected into them. If you want to hear warmth, listen to Daniel Kandi's remix for Evbointh's track "One Wish".<br>  <br>  One of the most important aspects of electronic dance music production often overlooked is production quality. My firm receives hundreds of tracks each month. 99% never make it to my desk due to insufficient production quality. Those that do sometimes don't have the quality to be considered even decent tracks. EDM production isn't easy contrary to common conceptions. You cannot just go out, buy a program, experiment for a little while, push a few buttons, and churn out a good track. Some people will tell you otherwise but they have no idea what they're talking about. Producing a good EDM track requires quite a bit of work. Whoever produced this track clearly: 1. Has not listened to enough EDM to know what a truly good EDM track sounds like, 2. Has not read and understood the contents of the Mixing Engineer's Handbook, a valuable resource for all producers, 3. Has not compared his/her track to that of professional releases. Now all of this may seem grim for this producer, but in reality, very few people meet all three of these very basic, and certainly not comprehensive requirements. <br>  <br>  If this producer sequenced his/her own parts rather than using loops, then he/she has demonstrated potential to become a good producer. However, this track certainly requires a lot more work, and perhaps more reading and listening on the producer's part; otherwise this is just going to remain another amateur production. <br>  <br>  Overall, this is a Tier 5 (Amateur Production) with a rating of 4 on 10.|`|PVIBTJESaa	Hey, not bad.
