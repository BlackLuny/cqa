hIqCpiXKaa	Yes. Came out on Tuesday.<br>  Helpful Hint: all movies come out on dvd on Tuesday. Blockbuster puts them out on tuesday. Another useful hint RedBox is cheaper then Blockbuster. You can also reserve the movie online, which will ensure its there when you get there. This is not the case at Blockbuster. There is a chance that your Blockbuster will not sell it, they stock movies according to popular genres that are bought in the area. If this was not popular, it might not be there. It also might be in short supply.
