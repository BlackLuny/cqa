jSkHquK5aa	Becoming a soccer player requires a lot of hard work and dedication. If you want to play professional soccer, you must really really want it. It is much harder to enter the professional world of sports, but it can be done. You are going to need the right equipment, coaches, determination, and support from family and friends if you are serious about becoming a soccer player. Here are some guidelines that will help with the process, from the early years all the way to adulthood.<br>  <br>  Step 1<br>  Buy a soccer ball for your child and begin kicking it around with him as early as you can. This will help get your child use to the idea of the sport of soccer. Spend some time each afternoon playing with your child so he understands what practice is like. <br>  <br>  Step 2<br>  Sign your child up for a pee-wee soccer team and allow him to work his way up. Having him join a team when he is young is important. It will get him use to the rules of the sport as well as the competition aspect of it. <br>  <br>  Step 3<br>  Start having a child work out at least five days per week. This is important to do once your child reaches the age of 12. He will need to be in good physical shape if he wants to continue to play soccer at his best and be able to compete with others. <br>  <br>  Step 4<br>  Register your child at some summer soccer camps. These camps are designed to help your child improve on the technical aspects of soccer. Your child can learn new moves that will really help improve his game. <br>  <br>  Step 5<br>  Once a soccer player is in his teen years, he should hire a private coach. If he is serious about playing soccer professionally, he will want to hire a private coach to help him hone his skills. <br>  <br>  Step 6<br>  Attend professional soccer games. Don't just watch professional games on television, attend some in person. These events will evoke the feeling of what it would be like to play a professional game. Games might also offer the chance to talk with professional soccer players. <br>  <br>  Step 7<br>  Research and then attend colleges that are known for their soccer teams. Scouts are not going to be looking for future soccer stars among small town college teams. An aspiring soccer player needs to get in to a school that is going to get him some exposure. <br>  <br>  Step 8<br>  Watch for soccer try-outs. This can be for semi-professional teams. A player may need to work his way in to a professional team by starting with a semi-pro team first. Scouts will also be watching these teams to find new talent. <br>  <br>  Step 9<br>  Get contact information for the professional teams. Send them a video. If coaches watch it and like it, they may just give you a call and ask you to come try out.|`|pSpWOsiQaa	practice,practice,practice|`|sKSeNAonaa	First of all, you need to be fully conditioned. Especially because you play midfield. You need to be able to be quick to get to the ball, and you need to have endurance. When the game is getting rough and the other team is becoming tired, you will have been trained properly and be able to persevere to the end of the game knowing you played your hardest. When you are conditioned, spend time with the ball. Bring it everywhere you go, and constantly be trying new things with it. Practice every day. Good luck!|`|j7LlGoxAaa	try to do some running (trust me, midfield has lots of running) also if you have a wall you can kick against, try to kick really hard at it and not let the ball pass you. Practice different tricks too. have somebody like a sibling or a parent try to get the ball from you, and try to get past them. Have a friend practice passing with you. If you have a soccer net, or if there is one around your neighborhood, practice shots on goal. I think if you practice this stuff you'll be a good midfielder.|`|qEaxGY8Oaa	when playing midfield in soccer, you have a ton of field to cover. you're mainly suppose to get the ball to the forwards and be back-up defense. first- you want to build up your stamina. try jogging at  a comfortable speed. start off doing a quarter mile, then a half, the 3/4 then a hole mile and so on.. make sure you can run the length and not be completely worn out. you want to try this for at least a week. next, you want to work on footwork.  try perfecting basic drills such as fakes, dribbling while looking forward, sharp turns, and fancy foot work.  if you work once a day for at least an 1hour, 4 days every week for at least a month, you should notice an incredible difference in your playing ability and the amount of time you play in games|`|Nf6ybJzUaa	you can go to some training camps, get a personal trainer, do some dripiling and sprints|`|MaYCHi3Qaa	Do everyhing that you do now<br>  But for midfield you can practice on running and back sprinting. <br>  I just run and do lots of drills so it's working for me
rK3mnJYoaa	Some of the answers here are astounding! <br>  <br>  So let me get this straight - it's ok for any bowling side to attack the bodies of opposition batsmen (including SA I might add, Steyn to Hussey, anyone?) as long as the aussies don't do it. Then, it all of a sudden becomes a heinous crime and we should all hang our heads in shame. What a load of garbage.<br>  <br>  Seriously, some people (not mentioning any names, like Adam P), should learn to quit running their mouths off and think before they speak (or type).<br>  <br>  Oh, and by the way:<br>  <br>  Graeme Smith - "Ouch".<br>  <br>  Jacques Kallis - "Ouch".|`|yzKrwvxSaa	Kallis: Yes, now i can pretend this tomato sauce from lunch on my shirt is blood.<br>  Smith: Ahh, the sun is blinding me<br>  EDIT: to all the people who are saying this is slack, have you ever heard of comedy? its just a bit of fun so get a life and stop telling us we are slack|`|MU84xfwbaa	Hmm... Smith's like "I really have to pee now" and Kallis would be "I hope they don't realise that's what's left of my jam donut".<br>  <br>  Guy above, it's cricket. It happens. I'm Aussie, and no matter who it is, it's a 151 kay ball coming at you. Either hit it or get hit.|`|mj1bC73gaa	Smith: "Awww, now what was that surgeon's name again *grimace in thought*" or ... "I wonder if that specialist is ambidextrous"<br>  Kallis: "Well I needed a clean shirt anyway"|`|xFHRxOzNaa	Aussies didn't start body line - the English did.<br>  The trouble with Smth is he keeps putting his fingers where they shouldn't be.<br>  <br>  If he is all fingers and Kallis leads with his chin, then what do they expect?|`|561a42dcf730fd97fc3a2ebd788ea961aa	they both were thinking how to face that particular delivery again~|`|f9hiPMDxaa	It's unfortunate that players get hit by the ball when batting but it comes with the game. I haven't seen too many comments against Steyn for bouncing Hussey but I suppose that's all right. It also shows how good batsmen in the pre helmet days were in avoiding the bouncing ball.<br>  <br>  In what the two players said on leaving the field: Medic, Medic.|`|Qq2MKeXUaa	Smith: I should've stuck to rugby<br>  Kallis: I wish my father taught me to shave when I was younger|`|Leoc8rlGaa	I don't think anyone should be glorying in players being hurt. It is not funny, and not something to be made light of.<br>  <br>  As for the Bodyline comment, both England and Australia were guilty of employing that tactic over the years. Warwick Armstrong bowled "leg theory" during the 1905 tour of England, Jack Gregory and Ted McDonald in 1921; and its use was widespread at various times by English bowlers too. The 1932-3 series in infamous for its use of it because the two bowlers at Jardine's disposal, Harold Larwood and Bill Voce, were of express pace, and the great Don Bradman was slienced by it.<br>  <br>  As for  the captions, what both players are probably thinking is that some stupid person is going to start poking fun at their discomfort for their own amusement. Graeme Smith and Jacques Kallis are two of the finest batsmen in the world, and do not deserve that sort of treatment. Anyone who finds their pain a matter for laughing at should hang their heads in shame, and question their own humanity.<br>  <br>  Edit: Ain't I Beautiful, if you knew your cricket history, you would not be claiming that Bodyline was started by Jardine's team, but would know that it's actual origins are far more ancient, with no particular country to "blame" for it. Both English and Australian bowlers were culpuble of it over the years. As for the asker, I don't have a problem with her. I just choose to disagree with her on many issues, and am not afraid to tell her so. I believe this forum is for asking and answering questions, not making statements. I happen to feel that posting pictures of cricketers in obvious pain is not a suitable topic for amusement, and I am not afraid to point this out. If Bingalee is at all offended, I apologise, but I maintain that this is no laughing matter. I also maintain that people should not make sweeping statements about England being the sole architects of Bodyline bowling, without categorically proving that is the case. Which of course they can't, because as I have said, both English and Australian bowlers employed those tactics at various stages.<br>  <br>  Edit:ayambumb. I haven't condoned what Steyn did to Hussey either. However, there is not a picture of Hussey in this question asking for raucous comments to be made about him. And I have no problem with the type of bowling being used by either Johnson or Steyn, and accept that the risk of being hurt is part and parcel of the game. However, laughing at people's injuries is something to hang your head in shame over.|`|KPFz6Qg0aa	Oracle y dont yu go soak yur head. what iz yur problem with the asker,she hasnt made fun of anyone.and we all know who started the bodyline stuff so dont try to talk yur way out of that. <br>  <br>  Smith,Mummy com kiss my pinky better<br>  <br>  Kallis, anyone get the number of that truck?|`|8FUAMccRaa	Smith-I knew it! Why didnt I use Steyn's gloves!? These cant even protect me against a tennis ball!<br>  <br>  Kallis-Why is it that I cant score against Australia? It couldnt be my slow scoring maybe I should get some advice from Duminy, who has played 125 tests less than me!|`|yeb7fyHsaa	What the hell is so funny about injuries Bingalee? I don't get it.<br>  <br>  I don't understand why some people refuse to understand the pain underwent by them. <br>  <br>  Stop being so apathetic and think before you make stupid caption contests.

gP6sCyGiaa	You are totally correct. Colleges really do not in any way look at high school tennis for recruiting unless you win state...and even then its not much. What you have to do is go to tennisrecruiting.net and look yourself up and see if they have a profile of you. tennisrecruiting.net is the website that all college coaches and junior players use for recruiting purposes. There you can indicate interest in colleges and the coaches there will see your name when they sign in to their account and they might want to recruit you. However, the only match results that are posted on the website are USTA tournament results. Also, players are ranked in their respected classes based on their results in tournaments. Generally, only the top 100 players of each class or maybe even 200 recieve big scholarships to D1. However, if you are considering DIII or DII you definetly have a shot. <br>  <br>  My overall recommendation, start playing tournaments and you will get noticed. Start off with local tournaments. You can look them up on usta.com with the tennislink portion of the site. if you do well, a bigger tournament to play would be your sectional qualifier. good luck with recruiting|`|QlrIUIfOaa	You can't.  College tennis coaches look at USTA rankings.  So play the USTA tournaments in your State.  You will need a minimum of a strong State ranking to attract any attention, e.g. top 10.  National ranking is also an indicator.  Not to be mean, but # 2 on your team does not tell much.  It is better that #6, but since we don't know the level of play, can't say.<br>  <br>  Play USTA tournaments.|`|hP3rJAuQaa	U-S-T-A|`|H78Mm1mlaa	I play tennis on my high school team as well in texas. The best way to get noticed is by joining the USTA and playing in ZATs. Read the rules for ZATs and once u get so many points in ZATs ull be moved up to CHAMPS. once you get enough points in the CHAMP division ull be moved in the SUPER-CHAMP division. once you're in their colleges will notice you. IF you are good, and when I mean good i mean good, you shouldn't have a problem becoming a super champ.  I hope this helps. Also, go to the college's tennis camp during the summer. That always helps... good luck.|`|cyt7oh97aa	I'd talk to your coach and see if he/she has any suggestions.  If playing tournaments would help then go for it.  Check out some colleges that you're interested in and see how their tennis program is.|`|wsQ6G8OEaa	Win more than you lose, a lot more.|`|cqGQcCN8aa	write them|`|NFgZCh4Naa	play with a wolfman costume on and get all the way to the championship  match.  but then show up as yourself, not the wolf, and prove to yourself that who you are is good enough by barely beating the mean opponent who stole your boyfriend.  im sure you will get a lot of attention from colleges and the media.|`|6CWCcAWXaa	I'm a tennis player myself. Trust me, its not easy. Unlike any other sports, you have to make some efforts of your own. You have to tell your coach and ask about any special scholarships, or if you plan on playing in college. I just wish people would get over basketball and football and pay attention to other fun sports already.|`|hxi90NTIaa	It depends if the college is big in tennis or not. I would just ask your coach, teachers or counselors for advice about the scholarship information. As for the tournaments, I think that you should play in them. It would be a great way to improve your skills and get noticed!|`|ZmPNvmtkaa	<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AvoNZUQcdz9NDKSKRIEy7a7sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307145245AA96mUA">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|80fb9226eb4d5a971a6f89fb8318a42faa	Yes play some tornements and try to join a tennis club

J6xmZqj1aa	The general rule of thumb for increasing mileage is 10-15% a week.  If you have all summer and spring to build a base then go with 10%, unless you have a race within a month.  You can start at any distance or time, but measuring your runs by time instead of distance is better than the other way around.  It's more accurate and flexible.  In xc we run between 2 and 5 miles on a regular basis, the longest are never over ten though, and on the day before a race we have pre-meet which is only 10 minutes.  Varsity almost always runs a 5k (3miles) JV sometimes runs a 3k (1.8) miles  Varsity also runs a few races about 4 miles long.<br>  <br>  You say that you can do it, but then why do you succumb to peer pressure when you do the mile?  If you want to be any good then you can't wait, you got to go now, there is no time to waste trying to fit in and be average.|`|7muaVxUxaa	1 - Start training.<br>  2 - When you are running take deep breaths in and out of your mouth.<br>  3 - Get a pace that you think you could maintain, maybe 75% then in the last 800m or so sprint still, heavy breathing.<br>  4 - Stretch before you run and do some warm up activities for about 30 mins|`|BB6HGbnPaa	Start off slow. When I started running, I started with a 10 minute pace for 2 miles. So 20 minutes for 2 miles. Once if starts to get easy and your body starts to adapt, increase your mileage by one mile and keep the running pace. Once you feel like you can run at least 4 miles in a 10 minute pace and you think the pace is slow, increase your running pace to 9 minutes but shorten your mileage to get use to that running pace. And continue from there. You your body will gradually adapt in no time.|`|JNDk1LUmaa	You should run 5 days a week, for as long as you want to each day. You will eventually get used to it and be surprised at how well you progress. But you must be consistent. Don't worry about mileage goals just yet, because once you get into Cross-Country, your coach will work your butt off everyday, and you're GOING to get very good at running. In the meantime, just get your body used to the motion, try out different forms and speeds and stride. Just don't do anything that hurts....but don't be wimpy either.|`|apMjpmogaa	If you are a guy, the normal distance is 5k  (3.2 miles).

Find your true mile race time and start training now if you want to do XC.  Meet your friends at the finish line and relax until they come in.  By training now it will be so much easier than waiting for the future.  For example, dieters are always saying it's ok I'll wait until tomorrow to start my diet!  Don't be like that and start today!  <br>  <br>  Actually for you since you taking P.E. start running 2 to 3 miles a day now.  It's ok if you walk and jog. If you goal is to join XC wouldn't it be so much easier to put the time in now?  Our cross country course was 2.7 miles however it probably depends on your course - most should be 5K or under for high school events.  <br>  <br>  For variation you can run around the track or grass and run 100 meters and walk 100 meters or run 200 meter runs and 200 meter walks totaling 2 or 3 miles. Plan on running 5K's to get you in racing shape for XC and doing a 10K in the summer as you progress. Also start training on your XC course and get used to running on hills.  <br>  <br>  Watch the video on Mackenzie who at age 13 ran the 50mile JFK race for inspiration.  Like you say anybody can do it however it's mental and you need to put the time into your sport. Good luck!

vXKSmDn7aa	5. Carlos Gomez- OF Minnesota Twins<br>  <br>  The speedy center fielder is set to have a great year in Minnesota. In his first full season in the majors, Gomez had 59 RBI, 7 HR, 7 triples, 79 runs, and stole 33 bases. Gomez should be good for 40 steals, 65 RBI, and 85 runs, which would be a great stat line for a late round pick.<br>  <br>  #4. Jair Jurrjens- SP Atlanta Braves<br>  Jurrjens is rated as the 51st best starting pitcher on the CBSsports.com fantasy rankings. Jurrjens went 13-10 with a 3.68 ERA in 2008 for the Braves. This was Jurrjens first full season in MLB after being traded from the Detroit Tigers. Jurrjens has a young fresh arm and could be the Braves #1 starter. This is the last season you will get Jurrjens late in the draft. He is highly underrated and is worth a late round pick.<br>  <br>  #3. Ryan Church- OF New York Mets<br>  Church is a guy who may be available with your last draft pick. He has fought off several injuries earlier in his career and should put together a decent season in 2009. In only 90 games Church had a .270 BA, 12 HR, 49 RBI, and 54 Runs. If he stays healthy, add 30+ to the RBI and Runs categories and probably another 8 HR's. If you need a final OF on your team, Church is your man.<br>  <br>  #2. Jose Lopez- 2B Seattle Mariners<br>  Lopez is highly underrated, and will have a breakout year and decent power numbers. Lopez is ranked as the 10th best second baseman, and will slip a lot of peoples minds when it comes to your fantasy draft. Lopez is still only 25 and has a huge upside, I would project a .295 average and up to 25 home runs, which would be very nice out of a second baseman.<br>  <br>  #1. Justin Verlander- SP Detroit Tigers<br>  Can you believe just a year ago Verlander was rated in the top 5 for starting pitchers and as a contender for the AL Cy Young? Because his terrible season of 11-17 and having a 4.84 ERA, Verlander is dirt cheap and rated as the 26th best fantasy starting pitcher. Verlander is 25 and has one of the best arms in the game. The Tigers bullpen and defense were both terrible last year, but have improved significantly due to several key moves in the offseason. The improved supporting cast and low expectations will help Verlander have a tremendous season. 18 wins is not impossible for Verlander in 2009.
JYqfA7Hjaa	You're right, but technically it is not a power play goal and is recorded as an even strength goal.|`|KDpR83oVaa	Ya Guy behind the net you are absolutely correct and I agree with Go Pens.  That team should still go on to the power play.  All five men are still in puck pursuit during that delayed penalty.  Only other thing is to consider is when you pull your tender.  Get the 6th man on the ice so you are essentially all ready up a man in that case.  What about if there is a delayed call on an already 4 on 3 or  5 on 3 situation and you score.  You still go onto the power play for another two while nullifying the one you just scored on????|`|L9pWts6baa	I see your point, but no it's not a power play goal. Even though I think even if you scored, you should still go on the power play. The other team commited a penalty and that's their fault.|`|SfTWwm97aa	It is counted as even strength.|`|EkgZeAbqaa	it does not count as a PPG but the penalty that would have been called is negated|`|JEenJYrkaa	No. They just don't get the power-play.|`|uzd0QaUtaa	it doesnt count as one but seeing how your goalie comes out wen theres a delayed penalty making an extra skater on the ice its just an even strength goal
mqGMkUXZaa	1) Know how to keep score. <br>  <br>  2) Be able to hit the ball in bounds.  <br>  <br>  Those are two important things if you want to play.|`|s7l6oZANaa	1. gilles simon is the best! not rafa xD<br>  2.get the ball in<br>  =D|`|cVwf11dRaa	ball and racquet <br>  <br>  if you want to play you should be in good physical condition and determined to improve|`|AA12034105	Rafa is the #1 player in the world :)<br>  Don't hit the net haha :P|`|db8T2vsEaa	1.

xQFWjFyZaa	All right, where should I begin? The draft order(1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) is usually chosen at random by Yahoo. <br>  <br>  During the draft, each person fills out a team with the players they pick. Positions and stat categories are chosen by the league/commissioner. <br>  <br>  Fantasy drafts usually use the Snake format. For example, in a Snake draft, the person who picked 1st in the 1st round would pick last in the 2nd round, then 1st in the 3rd round, and last in the 4th, etc. The Snake draft is favored because it usually results in each team having an even amount of talent.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you have more questions, but I can't really explain everything. Hopefully a few more people will add to this.|`|ZoIU9WtOaa	i really don't know sorry

jSkHquK5aa	Heading (hitting a soccer ball with your head) allows you to gain possession of the ball, pass, set up an attack, score goals and defensively clear the ball from the goal area.<br>  <br>  Step 1<br>  Arch your back as the ball approaches, with your chin inward, neck firm and legs bent. Keep your arms out to your sides for balance and to fend off defenders. <br>  <br>  Step 2<br>  Spread your feet apart, wider than shoulder width. Keep both feet on the ground (unless you need to jump to reach the ball). <br>  <br>  Step 3<br>  Snap your upper body toward the ball from the waist. Drive your head and neck forward as you make contact. Keep your head and neck moving together instead of holding your neck still while your head moves. <br>  <br>  Step 4<br>  Make contact with the ball squarely with your forehead. Keep your eyes open and on the ball, and keep your mouth closed. Avoid making contact with the top of your head. <br>  <br>  Step 5<br>  Direct the ball down by making contact with your head slightly closer to the top of the ball. <br>  <br>  Step 6<br>  Make contact slightly lower on the ball to send it upward. <br>  <br>  Step 7<br>  Follow through by continuing to drive your head forward. The strength of the header comes from the waist.|`|rsAqrbsgaa	You're hitting it in the wrong part of your head.  Try and hit it where your hair stops growing on top of your forehead|`|o7gV56ngaa	Head the ball with your forehead. Don't let the ball just hit your head. Tense your neck muscles and attack the ball. The ball is a lot softer than your forehead so don't worry, you won't get brain damage. If you can't head a ball you are missing out on a big part of the game and the coach may drop you from the team.|`|hTGu2ujeaa	If you keep your eyes on the ball you are so much more likely to hit it on the correct part of your head. The idea is to connect the ball with your forehead, not the bit just above your brows, but on the main swell of your forehead, just down from your hairline. Practice heading the ball gently with a lighter ball before going on to proper game headers.|`|SPTU5L6Qaa	It depends where you hit it.  I'm no doctor or pro soccer player, but trust me i've had my years of soccer.  Try using your forehead and a softer ball.  Depends on soccer ball material also.  Drink a lot of water and take a motrin or something before you play.|`|Nf6ybJzUaa	when u head the ball dont let the ball come to ur head, make ur head come to the ball. that used to happen to me but my coach told me to bring my head to the ball and it stopped hurtin|`|JwokyINXaa	Maybe the ball is hard try using a small ball and wait until your head stops hurting and drink water for you wont get tired also let someone pass you the ball don't do yourself that has happened to me too but the headache  will go away eventually if it doesn't go to the doctor<br>  Good luck with that :)|`|j7LlGoxAaa	Don't close your eyes when you head the ball, hit the ball with your forehead not the top of your head. I usually don't head the ball because of that problem, so if you want you can just chest trap it instead.|`|HIBESgUcaa	maksure ur heading it in the right place (around about your hairline) and also dont wait for the ball to hit you, contracted ur neck muscles and get your head to the ball|`|8Nv24atnaa	well its probbaly because u hit the ball wrong . and ur brain reacted differnetly .|`|80fb9226eb4d5a971a6f89fb8318a42faa	you are ment to head on your fore head if its still hurting go to the doctors
qXQa06bAaa	There isn't really a "magic bait", despite what products such as "Nitro dough bait" or "Berkley Powerbait" may claim in the advertising blurb (though some people have some success with it), most of them claims are largely to catch anglers..... especially if you just "chuck it and chance it", casting into a random patch of water and hoping the fish will just come to you.<br>  <br>  Try good old fashioned worms + spinners (the "Panther-Martin" brand ones seem to work particularly well for Trout), and employing the skill called "Watercraft"... which is basically instead of waiting for the fish to come to you, you go out looking for the fish and use your observational skills to watch out for likely places they could be hiding (e.g. around fallen branches, under boats, wooden jetties / piers, etc... anywhere that gives them shelter + somewhere to ambush food).<br>  This book is good for teaching you alot you need to know about it:<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/1843305674?tag=wormdanglecou-20&linkCode=sb1&camp=212353&creative=380553" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/1...</a>|`|Xbwvwwr4aa	I have found that Berkley Rainbow Glitter Power bait works well for me and is one of the more popular baits(at least where I live). Try different colors of Power Bait Dough.  The fish might hit some colors more than others.  Make sure that the bait has glitter as this can be seen in the water a little better.  Ask other anglers what Power Bait works best for them and try it out for yourself.  Good luck.

xQFWjFyZaa	Kevin Gregg is likely to be the Setup man for the Cubs. If that's the way it happens, I wouldn't expect more than 7 or 8 saves from him. <br>  <br>  George Sherrill is penciled in as the Closer in Baltimore, but he is competing with former Closer Chris Ray. I expect him to lose the role to Ray because of his shaky second half last season. Maybe 10-15 saves for Sherrill if I'm right, more if I'm wrong. <br>  <br>  Lyon started last season strong, but really faded to the point that he lost his job in Arizona. He's the lead candidate in Detroit, and there is very little competition. Rodney and Zumaya have their own concerns. <br>  <br>  I would take a chance with Sherrill, and maybe add Ray as insurance.|`|F65Km3Coaa	as long as sherril keeps the job(hopefully because hes on my team)then id pick him
f9soMMuiaa	With TO and Evans, are they going passing now? What the heck are they going to do with Lynch? And without a star QB, eventually TO is going to biiitch and whine.|`|7B9KEqCnaa	Not really that bad off. TO should be on good behavior his first year there, and it's only a 1 year deal, so he'll play hard so he can get a better deal next year.   Its gives the bills some star power and being that they play 2 games now in canada, maybe the canadians fans are gonna give TO some support since he seems to have warn out his welcome with american fans.  in the end Bills need star power to sell seats and thats exactly what they have done.  If they lose a lot of games this coming year maybe TO throws a tantrum, but its unlikely being that this could be his last chance in the NFL and any more bad behavior will probably lead to his retirement next year.  Its really seems like a no lose deal for the bills.|`|fz0Aw3hLaa	What are you talking about?<br>  He is a good wide reciever that has had over 1,000 yards recieving for the last 9 seasons, except for 2005 when he only played 7 games due to injury. And even then, he had over 700 recieving yards.<br>  Sure he is a loudmouth, and drops passes, but he produces on the field with yards and touchdowns.<br>  <br>  look at his stats, he is a 1st ballot hall of fame WR.<br>  For sure, and he is just a jerk, it's not like he has ever done any crimes.<br>  So give him some slack.|`|1i9mrq5Yaa	edwards is gonna quit|`|vweoheAvaa	That's according to a report, but if in fact this is true the Bills will at least be better @ the receiver position. Think about it: ME-O on one side & (a healthy) Lee Evans on the other side. That doesn't sound like a bad duo.|`|LpR9sLSlaa	lol<br>  <br>  I'll bet that most of the offense is stocking up on Prozac as we speak????<br>  <br>  (and probably most  of the fans will be too, before the season is over)|`|AA11503457	If the Niners had signed him the Yorks would have been run out of town once and for all (hmmm, might have been worth it)|`|N3LVlVmnaa	SCREWED ?<br>   dude he's good what are you on,<br>  yeah hes a dickkkkkk but the bills are<br>  gonna do so much better !<br>  Gooo billllllllllllllllssssssssssss !|`|LvLtAOBFaa	your gonna be looking at the best wide reciever duo ever. trent edwards wil be top 5 quarterbacks next year|`|XPFhS1EDaa	He's great he has a redzone target now.|`|gBfPkdroaa	lets hop trent edwards knows what to do with him.|`|hg8ExtsNaa	who cares?|`|H2OzAN8maa	completely. owens needs to shut his mouth for good. the team that signed him is in for a huge surprise. he'd be an awesome idol for plenty of people/kids if he could just his freaking mouth.|`|smDClNDkaa	He's not.<br>  <br>  TO is one of the best WR in the nfl.<br>  <br>  He becomes a dick during his 2nd season on a team.<br>  This is a 1 year deal.<br>  GREAT move by my Bills.<br>  <br>  Go Buffalo!!!|`|e9065dfa2249178c642f3f273c9dbb1caa	they arent screwed because to is a great reciever i think they will be one of the best offenses with owens arrival|`|bIbyAkHPaa	Completion % go way down.

Yeah, it must really suck getting an amazing hall of fame wr for your young qb|`|tzrLDbHWaa	He'll be fine, as long as he throws the ball to T.O. almost every play.  Regardless, it gives him a future HoF WR so thats instantly going to help.  Edwards is actually a pretty decent QB, having a star WR might actually help him A LOT.
S0u3HKzhaa	I agree completely,I miss when there would be heel commentators.I really miss hearing Jerry Lalwer side with the heel at all times.Now it is kind of boring with the commentators just routing for the heel and talking about how disrespectful the heels are.I miss that.I can remember Jerry Lalwer was about a full face turn in like 2006 I think when he fought Randy Orton in a match after Orton pushed him or something around Summerslam.Then really Lalwer was always siding with J.R on the faces.And JBL was the last good heel commentator I remember.Actually he was one of my favourites.JBL is very good at being an @ss loll.But when JBL went back to wrestling there really wasn't anymore heel commentating.I'd like to see them use it again it made it a lot more interesting I think.And personally I don't think TNA is going to accomplish much with Don West he really isn't too great at the heel commentating I don't think.That's my opinion though.|`|U6tE9LhJaa	It stopped when JBL became a wrestler again|`|QbY18bjkaa	man i miss king as ah heel|`|WQGvE60waa	I agree with you.<br>  <br>  Its' better with a heel annoucer as well.<br>  <br>  I am a heel sympahtizer.
BRX96ZUnaa	Coaching System. Warriors Coach Don Nelson focuses on offense. He don't really focus on defense therefore makes Ellis not a good defender. Don't get me wrong, he can play D, just not that well. In the Celtics coaching system, Doc Rivers mainly focuses his team to play defense all the time. That is why Boston won the championship last year and the Warriors were close and didn't make the playoffs. Monta Ellis was faster than Rajon Rondo, but his ankle is still in healing process so right now I say Rondo is faster.|`|kYBlgFQAaa	A lot of defense is about committment and mindset.  I think it helped that Rondo went to college and was taught the fundamentals and importance of defense.  He then went to a team that emphasized great D.  His role was not to be great scorer, obviously they have guys that can do that.  He puts in the effort and energy that it takes to be a good defender.<br>  <br>  Monta on the other hand is a pure scorer, since his high school days in Mississippi.  Then he went to the Warriors, where defense has never been the number one priority.  He has played SG for the majority of his career, so that only highlights his deficiencies.  He's only 6'3", and not very muscular, so he is at a huge disadvantage against bigger and/or stronger players.   So I think it has a lot to do with the factors you mentioned.  Mindset, coaching, system, body type....|`|dcNT65mTaa	Ellis plays for a team with no formula, no system whatsoever. I'm not sure Don Nelson even makes them practice. Rondo is in a system totally dedicated to defense so he gets more recognition for his defense. Ellis is the faster of the 2.|`|Boc1Buuwaa	Ummm, are you kidding me? I played ball with Rondo a few times when he was at Oak Hill, he lit everyone up. I wasnt much with my 2 and 3 point performances cuz of him destroying me but that was his best attribute. Quick little guy, steals every pass and locks you DOWN! Then he went to Kentucky and led in steals A LOT! Rondo is just that good, coaching aint got nothing to do with it
0fb4ce4da0f3875154ab271a088412fcaa	It usually gets anywhere from 140-170 for me. I sometimes do that when I'm bored with 2k8 and I find it really fun if you put different guys on your team and make a cool roster. If you have shooting game sliders up then its about 250-280, and they even stop saying the score. With normal gameplay about 140-170 points for each team.|`|5TPaYv3Vaa	i get about 140 points but i am really good but i mostly play 10 minutes and i usually get 100 points
Y7vEk6mDaa	make sure you are in the gym shooting hundreds of shots a day. drills include going from elbow to elbow shooting while someone rebounds. As for your shooting technique, remember BEEF. B is for balance, make sure your feet are pointed toward the basket and are shouler length, and you are leaning into your shot. E if for your elbow being in. E is for eyes on the back of the rim. F is for follow through and keep it up until your bell hits the rim. Also i recommend lots of arc and leg power into the shot.|`|L9pWts6baa	Well obviously you have to practice. if your 6ft. 2 and only 15, I'm guessing your a big man? Just start out close to the bucket and keep snapping your wrist and hold your follow through. My shots are a lot for accurate when I hold my follow through. Just keep practicing.|`|G0ino2hjaa	What you could do is first practice in a spot were you are most likely to be shooting in a game. Then, once you keep shooting at that same spot at every practice, you will get used to shooting from there and BAM! you are good at shooting!<br>  <br>  -hope i helped!!|`|pArydtqHaa	just keep practicing..<br>  practice makes perfect|`|RDppZhVYaa	try ankle weights|`|bNsVEsxgaa	practice and optimistic outlook are the biggest things people do not have.  Lots of people are skilled, but the best of the best practice a ton and have confidence in what they are doing.<br>  <br>  If you are looking for an easy way to improve your free throw shooting, start shooting underhand.  It will add atleast 10-20% onto your shooting especially if it is not good to begin with.  But, again you have to be confident doing this or it will not work either.
QouSk1E7aa	Yeah, that's the fed that nothing but gimmick matches. At least the old ECW had the occasional technical match in between the hardcore ****. I hate matches slapped together just to get ooohs and ahhhs from marks without any damn build up and no story being told in the matches. and TNA is almost as bad for overusing gimmick matches. Whatever happened to THE WRESTLERS SELLING THE MATCHES ON THEIR WRESTLING TALENT AND NOT NEEDING SOME GIMMICK TO SELL THE MATCH? Whatever happened to OLD SCHOOL TECHNICAL MATCHES?<br>  <br>  DON'T GET ME WRONG, IT'S NOT THE TALENT IN CZW, IT'S THE BOOKING.

" :]|`|DlQ5wL8saa	I dont think the dead mans streak will continue come on 16 times already i think shwn is going to end his streak cuz shawn is mr wrestlemania!!! no but for real it will end i go for shawn michaels that would be my birthday present the best if shawn wins cuz what can be better then being your birthday in wrestlemania thats what i think i cant wait for my birthday and also wrestlemania!!!!!|`|B56McJBvaa	Yea sure. If he can beat Vladimir Kozlov then he can beat the Undertaker. I am still supporting the Undertaker in that match though.|`|1UKAho1iaa	I think the streak will continue. It would be stupid of them to have the streak last this long just to end it.|`|BglekVnQaa	I think Taker's streak will continue. The WWE wouldn't just make him win for 16 years then become undefeated against HBK and most definitaly not on his hometown of Houston, Texas.

oAjbBLDpaa	I started watching wrestling with the WWE (F at the time). It was before the Attitude Era around late '95 or early '96, I don't remember clearly. I just remember that it was Shawn Michaels and Bret Hart feuding for the world title prior to Wrestlemania 12's Iron Man Match.<br>  That really exposed me to technical wrestling since I became a big fan of Bret Hart (which was partly influenced by my cousin who first showed me wrestling). I loved the match and since then I really held a love for true technical wrestlers like William Regal, CM Punk, Shelton Benjamin, and Jamie Noble that don't get the recognition they deserve.|`|l0GWmWl4aa	My first experience was watching The Undertaker get burned in a casket by Kane. So no. I'm a huge fan of technical wrestling. Malenko was probably my favorite after Benoit. I also liked seeing Brock Lesnar. He was technical, powerful, charismatic, and could fly. I like watching guys use precise moves that know which is the next move to go to then follow that up with another move, Not seeing guys get "burned" inside a casket. Hope that answers the question.<br>  <br>  BTW: What Up Nick?|`|9x1w6Tg0aa	it was there promos that made me like them then ther skills made me keep liking them so YES<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  good question nick|`|U6tE9LhJaa	No not really|`|cErYu6Jfaa	I started watching wrestling back when Bruno Samartino was the champion of WWWF (yes 3 w's, now the WWE).  They had some characters like Ivan Putski, Killer Kowalski, Gorilla Monsoon and also a rookie named Andre the Giant.  <br>  <br>  I dropped out of watching wrestling for awhile and then ended up watching WCW because it was more like old school wrestling with a few storylines.  To me now WWE is a lot of time on the microphone and little time in the ring.  I know a lot of people like that so I am not bashing it, just telling you my opinion.<br>  <br>  So yes, for me I was influenced by the first wrestling experience I had when I was younger.|`|NZKramllaa	I Started watching WWE around 1995. I was young at the Time and didn't really care for the Performance. I was just happy to see my Favorite Wrestler. As I got Older, I can admit, I got attached to the "Attitude Ara" and I began to like it alot! and didn't really pay Attention to the Traditional Aspect of Wrestling. It wasn't until I got my first Computer and Internet Access when I started to like Wrestling for what it is, and Not just Brawling and Blood.
PxtmMAMnaa	honestly, it kind of does. theres always hope for jv though. or if theres space on the team, you could make it. you should still try out, but you will need to put extra effort into jumping, smiling, and motions to make up for not tumbling. good luck!|`|SPqC4CQwaa	it depends if it is a competitive team and what level they are. if they want full team tumbling then it mightt.|`|FN1CjtuQaa	Don't think that. <br>  Cheerleading isn't all about tumbling.<br>  Just because you lack tumbling doesn't mean you can't compare.<br>  You could make your jumps 100 times better and still have the same chance. Or you if have great potential, maybe your voice iis strong & you smile all the time. Coaches don't always just looks at your tumbling. Remember, the way judges score you isn't all tumbling, there's still stunting, dance, cheer, & don't forget about your movement,s be stiff & SMILE !<br>  Like for my high school cheer tryouts last year, Tumbling was only extra points there was plenty of other girls that made it that  couldn't even do a cartwheel !
LHgPMwtLaa	I think it could happen for two reasons:<br>  a)Been there, done that.

ceQqYxtnaa	...thanks for clearing this up|`|FyLNdTJkaa	ture|`|lCfgqr1Waa	i knew|`|KO7mPumOaa	yeah but lebron is the media's "golden child" so he gets credit for everything. he is so ******* overrated and hyped up that it is not even fair to the other players in the NBA|`|5TPaYv3Vaa	thanks for telling me dude|`|dcNT65mTaa	No KG didn't! MJ used to do it for Johnny Red Kerr at the announcers table before every game. He didn't make it a spectacle like KG and LBJ does.|`|89650e173bc5a587806fdebc36366a40aa	hmm, I think someone else did it before him also...|`|XnhJZQvfaa	MJ started it, everyone else copied it so you don't know the truth either.|`|nBqZBbtnaa	Thank God you're here to set us straight. It would be a crime against humanity to give Lebron credit for that.|`|MsgqchCPaa	okay<br>  so. who cares?!
H3nbC71eaa	In the Golden Era, most of the Attitude Era gimmicks would probably be heels. Austin would've been a heel easily in the 80's. The Rock I could see as a face though, just because of how funny he was at times on the mic...I could picture him just being a face in the 80's.<br>  <br>  I think most of them would've done very well as heels during the golden era, they just wouldn't be as over the top as they were in the attitude era. We would also actually get to see them in some matches with clean finishes.|`|QbY18bjkaa	yea like i stated earlier they who have been over they broke in as cocky guys which would have work.

I know that the Spurs can be atleast 7th rite now, but they arent using their true talent and potential..|`|V5ASfdVbaa	Arsenal can win it all if we play properly|`|A6P5ibwJaa	I'm realistic most of the times, but just because you are optimistic does not mean you are un-realistic.<br>  <br>  This year, Arsenal will definatly not win Premier leauge, but I'm pretty sure that they will next year. I actually believe that Arsenal will win Champions league with some changes in their team.|`|2xHhE8wpaa	Inter Milan can win the scudetto but for the UCL is difficult ! IBRAHIMOVIC !
bNykcEVXaa	I find it funny that you guys 'claim' to go to footie matches... and think the banter on here is bad...<br>  <br>  what do you think the songs are all about ..?]<br>  <br>  <br>  dR bad<br>  ..the only reason its soured lately .. is because of the doom and gloom of the CITY ..and LIVERPOOL fans... and we ALL know why they are not happy... 3 in a row anyone..?<br>  <br>  Banter or boasting didn't just start on SUNDAY... have another look at the LINKS in my question everyone..  thanks in advance,...lol ..oh.. and thanks for the TD's too .. very telling with regards to targetting|`|duJgBxUoaa	^ True<br>  <br>  You really should address this to a particular user kitty..<br>  <br>  v Also true haha :)|`|HxET88bDaa	It's a lost cause. Can you see what you just tried to ask....but the answers you get are typically directed towards a certain set of fans whilst trying to defend another set of fans, it creates a never ending circle... i'd like people to answer this questions without actually mentioning any set of fans, but that's not possible. It would be also nice if people could stop agreeing with each other all the time and simply know what is good for the section, instead of just saying " i agree with the user who just slagged off the team i hate". Does my head in, but it'll never change.|`|tIBZ9Gi3aa	Why are United users all being targeted?Have I ever lost my temper at anyone because they insulted United?Has United fans like Deano chewed someone out because they preferred another team?What the hell?It's just a few of them,but we're all being generalised.<br>  <br>  I love talking about football.Sometimes,I write essays to answer a question.There's nothing I love to do more than to give my 2 cents worth,but lately some users are abusing others,and the place becomes no fun.I got a violation notice this morning for making fun of Liverpool's title chances.Is it illegal to joke about other teams?If it was,I wouldn't be here.|`|D7Dubtt9aa	No were not allowed to anymore the only opinions that matter are united rule. If you are not a Man utd fan you are not allowed to join in with the banter if you do it it is a insult.|`|ykH93Wyxaa	i agree|`|QuGTZJIVaa	Many on here forget this is a Q&A site NOT a banter football forum.<br>  <br>  Too many users focus too much about it being "only banter" but forget that you're meant to ask questions, the banter comes from the ANSWERS.<br>  <br>  Dan hits the nail on the head, once again.  It does seem to me that United users are the least likely to identify banter from abuse.<br>  <br>  @Mrs Luke Chadwick: I know you were, that's why i was agreeing with your question.  I agree banter is fine, but should come from the answers not disguised as a question.|`|BV2N3F8iaa	You see the thing is people are actually talking about football.<br>  <br>  Football is black and white with regards to your team, you will <br>  love your team until you die, this will never change, so people <br>  are talking about football, that is how banter is created!|`|N7fNwIQSaa	To be fair whenever anyone tries to ask a real football question they get ignored...<br>  <br>  I agree with you totally thats why i tend to write almost a full newspaper article when i ask questions sometimes...|`|A6P5ibwJaa	I agree with you.<br>  <br>  But I have to add it seems like some people in here has a little knowledge about football, so it's hard.|`|A7QROnjLaa	Wishful thinking.|`|esIvgHxnaa	Go Gunners!|`|5rL1rBUaaa	No.<br>  <br>  No we can't.

7JEWBeEjaa	I like Jair Jurrjens over Aaron Cook, because Jair would provide more strikeouts. ERA and WHIP would be pretty much balanced for both. Aaron Cook would probably provide more wins, so depends on what you wanna get from the pitcher. Overall, my opinion, I'll go for Jair Jurrjens. Good Luck|`|xQFWjFyZaa	I would rather have Cook.|`|cCIQdtlmaa	I stay away from all Colorado pitchers considering where they play 81 games.
0fb4ce4da0f3875154ab271a088412fcaa	I hate the contracts and the amount of money these guys are getting paid, nobody deserves that much. I don't hate the players though, there good players and they don't need hates when they are great players.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Well, first off, you may think Manny is a joke with his contract, but he's a great baseball player who helps the team immensely and has been successful wherever he goes.  He's also a player you can count on when you need him.  Why are you hating on Manny when A-Roid makes more money, will be making more money until he's 43 (Manny is 36 and could only get a 2 year deal), is a proven cheater with the steroids thing, and chokes when the pressure is on.  What about someone like Tracy McGrady?  He's close to $20 mil a year, has never gotten out of the first round, and he's always hurt?  What about Stephon Marbury who made $20 mill this year for sititng at home?  Don't hate on Manny when he's actually doing something to earn his money.<br>  <br>  As for LeBron, hey, if you had the ability LeBron had, you'd probably be a little flashy as well.  I mean, you may not like the way he dunks, but in some cases its actually helpful.  Think about it, if you're playing a home game and you come up with a spectacular dunk that brings the crowd to their feet, it can change momentum and actually help the team as a whole.  The players just do what the fans want to see, and fans want to see spectacular dunks over layups.|`|UG2VpQjaaa	There are, but may I have some input?<br>  <br>  LeBron is a showman, he has done things that no other 24 year old in the world can do, he has revolutionized a city and a country sportswhise. If you were at the top of the world wouldn't you have a bit of flourish off your dunks?|`|qAkbPzTLaa	No !
NZKramllaa	No, Not for Me, It all depends on your Preference of Entertainment, Some people Prefer Classic "Traditional Wrestling" or "Blood Gory" Wrestling. It doesn't mean your a "hardcore" sadistic type of person if your like Blood "Gory" Wrestling or Your a Clean, Tidy person if you Prefer Classic Wrestling, There could be Masked Serial Murders that like Classic Wrestling or The Nicest Saint you will Ever know that loves Pure Blood and Violence in Wrestling, but Wrestling Style does have that type of effect on Some People but I can say I do take Characteristics from how my favorite Wrestler is potrayed but Not Promotion.|`|IMu3wBu8aa	I would say my personality fits the WWE/TNA type. This is a great question. I've never thought of it like this. Most people that I know who were obsessed with ECW...the old one...had a violent way about them. I can see that there are different personalities in each promotion. It's like someone said about music. It's pretty similar.|`|UWJinEbIaa	I watch UFC and I feel like I need to give everyone a flying knee.....<br>  <br>  I watch ROH and think that I am smarter than everyone else....<br>  <br>  I watch japanese wrestling and want to high kick and/or lariat people...<br>  <br>  I watch TNA......I'm all talk and no action :)<br>  <br>  I watch WWE....I believe everything I see on tv :)<br>  <br>  I watch lucha libre....I always wear a disguise in public :)|`|482oQASHaa	No wrestling fan i have a life.. meaning  i have a real Job, so  wrestling has no affect on my job.. because as you know the US Economy is on trouble, with real peoples losing  their jobs the Unemployment rate is at  8.1. which is really bad.  so yes for me watching wrestling is good with it taking my mind off of things. but still my job comes first|`|QskM0Mfsaa	the fact that one is a wrestling fan reflects on them on the whole.<br>  it automatically places one into a category of limp brained midgets.|`|H3nbC71eaa	I'm a fan of all those except CZW...and DragonGate..though Dragongate is only cause I've never seen it. Zero 1 I haven't seen either so I can't add them to this answers.<br>  <br>  But I'm a fan of all those others you mentioned, But I have a little of everything you mentioned up there..though the ECW comparison more in my younger days than now.<br>  <br>  To answer your questions, I think I'm a combination of all of that you mentioned, so I would say the wrestling style doesn't really reflect who I am, or it says that I'm a person of many tastes.|`|pdB4LIUZaa	I think that it's more so my own personal style effects my preferred wrestling style.<br>  <br>  For example I do activ, 'risky' stuff which tips over into a wrestling style of preferring the more high flying entertaining, athletic wrestling styles.|`|lGIL36faaa	yes 4 example i like jeff hardy and his style and im actually extreme,unique and different like jeff...<br>  <br>  good question btw|`|qqLcvDDKaa	CZW sure made learn how to accept violence.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9WPSSEqZfg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9WPSSEqZ...</a>|`|e3m3rdNYaa	I think in a certain sense, I am priarily a Full Impact Pro fan, Thats pure Wrestling. So I guess I hate Bullshit. I will tell you I how feel; if you disagree, Kiss my ***!!!|`|a6cb15fd4b323dbc753a289a5e6f7a87aa	No not really, I watched the original ECW, and it had no affect on how I am as a person today.|`|b1648XnPaa	I like Tech/Hig Flying wrestling. And I'm an out going guy. Not sure if there is a corrilation|`|EZf00NJJaa	In m case ., No .|`|53986a54fb7e28986e6d815651923852aa	In a way I think it does. To a small extent, just like music. But I think it more reflects the majority of emotions you feel. I'd say people like my who like technical and pure wrestling tend to be mellow, laid back people, who don't like crazy nonsense of life (or "sports entertainment storylines")

a6CxaY2baa	I hope USA can win tomorrow so that they get to the quarterfinals. Wawrinka did beat Roddick before. He did it at the semifinals at Rome last year winning just 3-0 because Roddick retired on clay. I know you think that you are sure Roddick can pull it off, but don't count Wawrinka out because I have seen him play with the top 10 players like Novak and he can give you a run for your money. If Roddick fails, than I hope Blake wins. The worry is that Marco Chiudinelli can shock us if Roddick can't prevail because in the 2007 World Group 1st round in the Davis Cup, he replaced Federer because Federer decided not to play, and he won 2 upsets over Fernando Verdasco and David Ferrer to almost lift Switzerland (in Switzerland's home) over Spain 3-2 to the quarterfinals had he also won the doubles as well, which was very close. <a href="http://www.daviscup.com/teams/player.asp?player=10022895" rel="nofollow">http://www.daviscup.com/teams/player.asp...</a><br>  As an American, I don't count anyone out because everybody gets surprised sometimes when you don't expect it. Anyway...best of luck! Go team USA!<br>  <br>  Edit: If Switzerland beat us tomorrow, I'll be shocked because I can't remember a time where we lost in the 1st round of the Davis Cup, but at the same time I won't be totally surprised because Spain last year won the Davis Cup over Argentina in Argentina without Nadal. Why can't the Swiss do it without Federer?<br>  <br>  Edit take 2 haha: If you want, please answer my tennis question. Just posted it about a 1/2 hour ago. <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AgDptJuyWfb.yFKAFLOZE.zsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307154321AAy8tZw">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  Edit take 3: Anna, now I remember. I almost forgot that lol To tell you the truth though, I didn't know that whenever Andy has the chance to clinch the tie, he's 10-0 and known as "The closer". In that case, looks like he never gets nervous when he has the chance to close out a tie because he'll play even better than his first rubber he had to play. Well...in that case, we shall see the outcome tomorrow.|`|VefSnu0Gaa	hopefully not.-<br>  andy will win, i mean he has to, he's "the closer", heh (10-0 when he has the chance to clinch it)<br>  ovbiously it's goint to be a tougher match than the one on friday, but i think andy shouldn't have mayor troubles with stan.-<br>  the pressure of having to close the tie i think always plays on favor of andy, it's like he gets even more pumped and gives 110%.-<br>  good luck for our boy tomorrow!!!<br>  go usa!!!<br>  :D<br>  <br>  <br>  btw, this tie's been about breaking records, andy tied agassi on friday (hopefully he'll pass him tomorrow) and the bryans broke the record of most winning pair of the states, it's gotta be cool for the guys to make it into the records book, don't you think?<br>  :)<br>  <br>  <br>  edit: uvi, we lost first round in 2005, and then had to play to stay on the world group against belgium, remember the hole dr. evil thing between andy and the belgium captain??|`|Z2gIo6HKaa	i hope roddick doesnt hav any trubl but if he does hes got massiv serves 2 help him along da way|`|AA12034105	I don't think Roddick will have any trouble :)|`|k6M48eUMaa	Wawrinka is a great player, but unfortuantely, I don't see him beating Roddick :(|`|RMxTrBnIaa	if wawrinka is playing well tomorrow the he can potentially beat roddick

b0B3bJsUaa	They have been in "trouble" ever since Kobe took over as leader of the team from Shaq around the 2003 or 2004 season, and then rode him out of town.<br>  <br>  I mean, the Lakers have since been in trouble, if they seriously want to win a championship, that is.    And that's because no team led by Kobe Bryant will ever win an NBA title, though Kobe as the secondary player to another star would make for a great duo and a championship calibre team, as in the Lakers from 2000 to 2002.<br>  <br>  For this series, though, Lakers are not in trouble.  They should still win it in 6.    <br>  <br>  But if they lose Game 2 as well... then that's when we say that they are in trouble in this series.  <br>  <br>  But they won't and they will win this series, and Laker fans will be happy, but it will come crashing again when Lakers again fail to win the title.|`|EbU8hqshaa	ok they will be if they lose tommorow night. If they come back to win the series. They will not make to the finals if they play the nuggets. They will make it to the finals if they play the mavs. Then somebody will kick their butts. The lakers can beat boston. The lakers could also beat the hawks. They can't beat the cavs or the magic.|`|hDOasSPuaa	Yes they are... Lakers fans are kidding themselves if they say they aren't... Granted the Lakers have the best road record in the regular season... But don't forget, the playoffs are a different cup of tea... The Lakers need to focus on winning game 2... A loss in game 2 to me could end the Lakers playoff run...|`|tP4cDVhgaa	of course they are although it was 1 game the rockets arent going to be the Utah Jazz they will probably beat the lakers in 6 and even if Lakers beat the rockets their gonna lose to da Nuggets|`|AjD6Vm8Saa	Intresting<br>  if this was a one game series Lakers and Celtics would have been done<br>  but No its a best of 4-7 <br>  so u get to fix ur mistakes dont worry Los Angeles is bouncing back|`|ao0gR3CYaa	they should bounce back and win this series but i dont think they will make it to the finals.|`|GtP0v6K9aa	no they'll bounce back because kobe wasnt really 100% yesterday...he was sick|`|XVmhcTnUaa	Lakers lost at home. That is a big problem.|`|WLXFAeSnaa	Nooo...|`|ZCHmhuFQaa	They just lost one game! The Lakers can make up the game in game 2. The Lakers can win the next 4 games.|`|qVMg9YRsaa	They're not in trouble yet... L.A. played as awful as I've seen them this year and that's a good thing for them considering they at least hung in the ball game all night... if they lose game 2 then they'll be in trouble... but my guess is Kobe will do exactly what he did to Utah after they won a game... he came out with force and destroyed his opponent and the rest of his team followed. Look for that in game 2 and if not's there in game 2 then re-ask your question and I will say, YES!|`|QJgcwXzxaa	One loss does not harm a team. Expect for them to bounce back the next several games against the Rockets|`|gqwYr49Raa	well they did lose their home court advantage|`|j0YJX8U6aa	they lost home court<br>  <br>  <br>  u tell me???

ZsujbEjJaa	there's a lot of guns and a lot of things to shoot.|`|ZYOJQdjyaa	Well according to the percentages given it isn't necessarily popular, it's just that the media seems saturated with the idea...<br>  <br>  The hunters I have known have been very responsible, but I'm in Canada. Guns were always kept separately from ammo - in the case of one gent he kept his ammo at a friend's house across town (he was aware that he had some anger-management issues and wanted it to be difficult for him to use a gun in rage). Hunting and fishing (and trapping) by its very nature requires unspoiled wilderness - hunting aficionados were among the first to raise awareness of the environment and its importance to the continued health of humans.<br>  <br>  That being said, when I say 'responsible' I mean that they always made sure they had proper permits, did not shoot at anything that was not permitted, and usually ate whatever they took down, trading or selling the hide, bones and tendons to local First Nations tribes or non-natives that had a use for the offal. The gent who kept his guns and ammo separate was enraged as he related the following tale:<br>  <br>  He was hired by some Americans to go on a bear hunt. After ensuring that the tourists understood what was expected of them and obtaining appropriate tags, they set off into the woods. After many hours of travel they were very far away from their vehicle and towing equipment, and it was at that point the bear was spotted. Notwithstanding the guide's admonition that retrieving the corpse would be near-impossible, the tourists shot it anyways, then grew angry when they discovered that a ton of dead meat is not easy to move. Rather than go back for the towing equipment they decided to leave. The guide was gravely disappointed in the nonchalance of his charges.<br>  <br>  Lead shot is becoming a real concern as much of it doesn't always hit the target and rather falls into bodies of water or into the soil. This has caused interference in the natural processes of many game animals.<br>  <br>  I personally don't mind hunting as long as you eat what you kill. The practice of trophy hunting is actually defeating the purpose of conservation, as the most suitable animals for breeding are also the most suitable animals for trophies. By removing them from the evolutionary process it allows less-fit animals to mate.<br>  <br>  There is some research being done into the effect of hunting and fishing on wild populations. One of the side effects is that prize-winning fish are perhaps half as big as the champion catches of previous (50+) years. I'm a catch-and-release type myself unless I hook something yummy.<br>  <br>  The popularity of hunting might be tied to the fact that automatic weapons are available, and hunting gives one an excuse to own one. My hunting associates frown on the practice, saying that it takes the skill out of lining up a shot and wastes ammo.|`|O3TuQZItaa	To truly answer this question, you will have to turn to the good folks at P.E.T.A.<br>  <br>  As the folks at People Eating Tasty Animals will tell you, they just taste good.<br>  <br>  There is nothing like a well toasted bit of Bambi. Thumper is real good in stew. I do recommend staying away from Flower, there can be some problems there.<br>  <br>  The net point is that hunting provides a good source of food for a great number of people that do not live in the big human hives we call cities. For that person who lives an hour from the nearest market, hunting is a very reasonable response to a need. It also provides a method of connecting ourselves with nature. When you kill your own food instead of hiring it done, you understand much.|`|0lEdqFlVaa	Huntings popular everywhere.|`|Fvgs8FWuaa	popular every where|`|Es3XXoVsaa	People like to eat.<br>  Hunting gets that food.|`|OBh7uEd1aa	nothing else to do on cold rainy snowy,windy,sun burning days|`|X2ZsYRNWaa	Tradition and good laws mostly.  There was never an aristocracy that tied up all the good hunting grounds so hunting is not the "sport of kings" like in Europe.  So regular people have been free to hunt for centuries and restrictive new laws have not stopped them.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	That depends on what your using to judge popular considering that Only 15% of the population in America participates in Hunting.* 75% of the American People approve and condone Hunting in America.* 10% of the American people disapprove, or are not in favor of Hunting.* 85% of the population of America does not participate in the Sport of Hunting.* Yes, We Hunters are a Minority in America.* However there are over 80+ Million Gun Owners in America.*|`|dfBwVxXFaa	It is a way of life for some of us. I really feel sorry for all the anti-gun peta people out there that have never experienced hunting. Maybe if more people would have taken the time to take their children hunting and camping and such, there would be less gun crime in the cities.  You don't hear much about gun crime in the smaller towns where people spend time hunting and spending time with their families.|`|H2atnQuAaa	hunting is a natural instinct. studies have shown that people who dislike hunting have self esteem issues. you can research this|`|ibMK6nPeaa	They try to cut back the increase of population.<br>  mfG gw38|`|8A0JdS7Xaa	We respect nature and understand our place in it.

In fact, the stadium is small enough that there really aren't any bad seats.

High blood pressure maybe.  I know the colors are related to high blood pressure.|`|apMjpmogaa	Four thoughts:<br>  1. It is normal to sometimes black out when sprinting. This is because your body goes into oxygen debt. You can maybe make this happen less often (and improve your performance) by building lung capacity and training your body to use oxygen more efficiently. However, blacking out every single time might indicate another problem.<br>  2. You need to be drinking lots of water. Dehydration has the potential to mess you up for life. Don't dabble with disaster.<br>  3. You need to eat enough. My first thought when I read this was, "I wonder how much she eats." High-performance sports, when mixed with an insufficient diet, can KILL you. Please, if you aren't eating enough, stop running immediately and tell someone you trust. Finishing a season isn't worth your life.<br>  <br>  4. I would recommend consulting a trainer or athletic doctor. Your blackouts might actually be from normal exertion, or there may be a problem with your body. You may have low blood sugar or something like that.|`|cKXZOLJSaa	i'm a sprinter also and I feel the same way after just about every practice.<br>  Just make sure you take a water bottle out there with you and try to drink water, but don't drink too much or you'll get water logged.<br>  If its too bad, just stop, I have to sometimes, I just tell my coach I really cant and he understands now how I feel.<br>  Just try to take it a little easy and get some fluids|`|E2DhXryxaa	there is no way that this is normal.

These 14 suspensions explain all the weird and odd match endings at SummerSlam. Here is the list of who was suspended again, and I will do some more explaining.<br>  <br>  Mike "Simon Dean" Bucci<br>  Gregory Helms<br>  Edge<br>  Charlie Haas<br>  Santino Marella<br>  William Regal<br>  King Booker<br>  Chavo Guerrero<br>  John Morrison<br>  Mr. Kennedy<br>  Randy Orton<br>  Funkai<br>  Chris Master<br>  and Batista<br>  <br>  So, as I was saying, this all makes perfect sense. Although reading this list at first your jaw may be dropped so low it is now resting in your lap, trust me, this makes sense.<br>  <br>  Let's start at the top. The top 3 don't really matter, Simon Dean, Gregory Helms, and Edge, because they are not currently wrestling. While Charlie Haas is somewhat irrelevant, and the Santino, Maria, and Ron Simmons angle was completely worked out of RAW last Monday.<br>  <br>  William Regal is a little harder to explain, but he wasn't involved in any feuds so he will slip out nicely. King Booker's angle with Triple H wasn't continued, so he'll slip out easily too.<br>  <br>  Now, I don't want to give away to much from the Smackdown Spoilers I read, but I will say Chavo wasn't in the show. So Chavo too, slips out nicely.<br>  <br>  John Morrison is by far the toughest to explain. I think the fact that he kept the ECW title means that these suspensions are short. Also, ECW doesn't need him on TV. He could have shot some promos last Tuesday, and they could just air them in these coming weeks. So they don't really need him there.<br>  <br>  Mr. Kennedy makes sense too. This may be why he didn't win the IC Championship like many were expecting. Same goes for Randy Orton only with the WWE Title.<br>  <br>  Funkai is irrelevant, and so is Chris Masters, for the most part. I will say that from the spoilers I read, his new angle could involve him being gone for a few weeks.<br>  <br>  Finally Batista. (Again, trying not to tell to much about Smackdown) All I will say is that the feud with The Great Khali isn't going to continue.<br>  <br>  See? Perfect sense.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://wwegeek.blogspot.com/2007/08/wwe-suspensions-explain-summerslam-raw.html" rel="nofollow">http://wwegeek.blogspot.com/2007/08/wwe-...</a><br>  <br>  They included the steroids nandrolone and testosterone, growth hormones genotropin and somatropin and anastrozole, which is used to counter physical side-effects of steroid use like 'man-boobs'.<br>  <br>  Sports Illustrated - whose investigations led to police raiding the 'anti-ageing' company selling the drugs - have now listed what each star was taking in the period up to the bust in February 2007.<br>  <br>  The WWE's Wellness Policy, aimed at stamping out such use, was introduced in February 2006. Anyone caught buying drugs over the Internet after that date faces suspension.<br>  <br>  Through WWE spokesman Gary Davis, the applicable WWE wrestlers listed above declined comment.<br>  <br>  In the wake of Eddie Guerrero's steroid-related death, the WWE instituted a "Talent Wellness Program" in February 2006. The policy "prohibits the use of performance-enhancing drugs, as well as other prescription drugs which can be abused, if taken for other than a legitimate medical purpose pursuant to a valid prescription from a licensed and treating physician. For purposes of WWE's policy, prescriptions obtained over the Internet and/or from suppliers of prescription drugs from the Internet are not considered to have been given for a legitimate medical purpose."<br>  <br>  Under the Talent Wellness Program, an initial positive test triggers to a 30-day suspension and a second positive leads to a 60-day suspension. A third positive yields a termination.<br>  <br>  After Benoit's death, Representative Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) contacted the WWE requesting more information on the Talent Wellness Program. In addition to the rash of recent wrestler deaths, Congress has expressed concerned that the WWE counts more than more 500,000 kids among its weekly viewership.<br>  <br>  -newer links-(sept 2nd)<br>  <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/2007/08/30/2007-08-30_top_wwe_names_emerge_in_doping_scandal.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/2007/0...</a>  (sept 1st at 11:06pm)<br>  <a href="http://www.prowrestlingscoops.com/article/190714278.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.prowrestlingscoops.com/articl...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.prowrestlingscoops.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.prowrestlingscoops.com/</a><br>  <br>  -older links-<br>  <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/more/08/30/wrestlers/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/mo...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2003560001-2007400669,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,20035...</a><br>  <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/news/story?id=2998062" rel="nofollow">http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/news/stor...</a><br>  <a href="http://marmalade29456.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://marmalade29456.blogspot.com/</a>|`|ik8I8lUhaa	AH....

9hC7bbf7aa	ATP made a good gesture by inviting ITF and Davis Cup players to be rewarded from 2009..'Tis a beginning, not perfect yet. As you mentioned it gives a wonderful opportunity for lower ranked players to see some daylights ? Besides they play Best of 5 sets, and they DO deserve to earn points.<br>  Only the elite World Group and W.G playoff rounds for the singles and doubles are rewarded.<br>  ATP considers DC as a tier 1, of 500 level. No commitment is required from the players, and no penalty of no show as long as there's a sufficient time notice. Players will accumulate the points dur' 52 weeks as is with ATP point system. They earn 5 to 75 pts per single victory. Sliding scale , starting at 5 pts per single victory in a DC play offs to 75 pts at a DC final match victory. And no points for dead Rubber. 'Tis all I'd discovered, I also wanted to know about ATP's DC point allocations for sometime. ATPtour website made it extremely difficult to understand, and no info on the points allocations precisely either. Thanks for asking this question, I have learned a little more about ATP & DC agreement. :)

fWMzd7y5aa	You have to be 19 or one year out of high school to enter draft. It was put in a couple of years ago.|`|dcNT65mTaa	U have to spend a year in college before being eligible for the NBA Draft. No American can come straight out of high school. International players make their way into the NBA without it though.|`|yt05KPhBaa	You have to be 19 by the draft or a year out of high school.
gVYfFSpRaa	As with baseball, your legs give you most of your power, so you need to work on coordinating your stride perfectly with your swing.  Meet the ball IN FRONT of you and take your hands to the ball.  Don't uppercut, because you'll only pop it up.<br>  <br>  Noooo. Fast pitch softball is way more common, and there are fastballs, curves, change-ups, drops, rise balls, screwballs, and more.|`|naPq2mbtaa	i play softball too! well if you are using an aluminum bat find the "sweet spot" and swing really hard!|`|du09EKkoaa	Well i play softball myself...the key to hitting the ball harder is to build up muscle. Try lifting weights or something. It works & it has helped me also.|`|9BmY9G9qaa	your legs will help you the most but geting your hands extended and through the ball will create more distance and hard line drives

Rq0Ni0Ncaa	I also did this last summer. I got a 10 gallon fish tank at Petco for $10 when they had a sale on it. I went out to my mom's garden (I'm 14 years old) and got a bunch of soil that filled up the tank up to 3/4 of a tank. I then went out and bought 3 dozen worms and later went out a few nights in a row after our lawn got watered and picked some. After around a month I would say I saw a bunch of what looked like white eggs. They then hatched and then I had more worms. I have since upgraded to a 15 gallon tank to hold them. They breed fast. Good luck with your worms and fishin'!|`|crS1HZ9vaa	many years ago I had the same thought as you. well I bought a  magic worm ranch fill about 3/4 of the way but do not fill to the top they need to breathe added the worms that were left over from a fishing trip or buy one more time from the store. make sure the soil is damp and sprinkle cornmeal on top they will breed and get fat quick.you can keep them inside since they won't smell up your house.when you go on your next fishing trip get a small styrofoam container with some of the soil and whatever you have left over just place it back in the big cooler.<br>  <br>  here is a good starter farm<br>  <a href="http://www.magicworms.com/MagicWormRanchKIT.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.magicworms.com/MagicWormRanch...</a>|`|ZRv94Pdtaa	Well but then you have to buy a bin for em. you have to dig up dirt and put it in there. Buy it food. You have to care for em, feed em, and make sure they are healthy and don't die. So i mean screw that. <br>  <br>  Idk where you live but if there is a freshwater fishing spot. Its probaby gonna be in the woods or near the woods. its like like CITY POND CITY.<br>  so just go digging. I mean they are everywhere in the woods. An easy tool is to get a 2-3ft stick. cut into the sides of the stick and make ridges in the stick. Then sharpten the bottom of the stick. Put the stick into the ground and get another stick and rub it against the side with the ridges. It will probaby make a noise but it causes a vibration in the ground and earthworms attract to it. So you will see some surfacing. Then just pick em up. <br>  <br>  Flip over rocks they are good worm spots.|`|50e3b0849b4360114052f91433a42927aa	check this out maybe it will help|`|yAqhqxVQaa	after it rains go out after dark and catch em
7KG473c0aa	Yes of course it is.The top 4,Man unt,Chelsea,Liverpool and Arsenal have the big money to buy their way to success.<br>  Premiership football has now become a 4 horse race and a league within a league were players are payed some ￡100k per week whilst poorer clubs struggle to even pay their back room staff any wages.|`|o7gV56ngaa	In a capitalist system these may be some of the pit falls, but believe me it's a much better system than the American system where teams are restricted on how much they spend and the best young players are drafted to the weakest teams to try to keep the teams on par with each other.<br>  I'm a West Ham supporter and we can't compete with Man Utd or Chelsea when it comes to money, but it feels good when we go to Old Trafford and win.|`|70eOB44yaa	you want some cheese with that wine? no i dont think football is becoming facical. look at arsenal they dont spend a lot and they are still up there
sNR1IfDPaa	NO! THE USA WILL WIN! THE JAPANESE HAS ONE GOOD PLAYER AND THAT IS ICHIRO|`|oblnqjenaa	No dude, team Japan won't win the classic.

Qyk0Rdu5aa	yea especially people like Stephon Marbury give ma a break|`|u2QhQAxzaa	Yeah I totally agree with you, bro.  Don't get me wrong I love sports but give me a break, when you are making more than anyone in this world, even educated people who shape the future of generations, and you have the balls to complain cause you aren't making that extra 5 million that you want.  And for that poster who said they only play for 10 years, so what, they make around 30 million, even if u are a bench player in 10 years, I could live off of 30 million in two lifetimes.  But hey, thats capitalism for you.|`|dcNT65mTaa	I only get pissed when role players are overpaid or star players of the past get overpaid only to sit on the end of the bench injured all season (Gilbert Arenas for example).|`|kCSJyM8Laa	I remember when Joe Willy Namath came out of Alabama and signed with the Jets for.....get this......$100,000..One hundred thousand dollars..making him the highest paid athlete....look how far we have come.<br>  <br>  What is worse most of these thugs can not pour pi$$ out of a boot if the directions were on the heel..makes ya proud don't it?<br>  <br>  Makes ya proud when good hardworking Americans are being fired and laid off every day and the parasites just get fatter.|`|1NVMh8wSaa	I've been working my a** off for 15 years to have a home and a car to drive. So yes when these players complain about money even though they are set for 3 lifetimes, I find it really insulting and I lose a lot of respect for that player even if he is on the team I like.|`|fWMzd7y5aa	I agree kinda. Only some ppl piss me off. Kobe, LeBron, and Wade deserve money. Others do not like Arenas.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Yes and no.  I mean comments like Sprewell made back in the day saying "hes got a family to feed" were rather absurd, because its hard to imagine that you cant feed a family on any superstar's salary.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, I understand where they're coming from.  I mean, its just natural to want to get paid what you're worth.  If you see players that you're better than making more money, its just natural to think you deserve more.<br>  <br>  Finally, while it may piss you off that they're making millions and complain, think about it this way.  If they don't make the money, then who is?  The owners.  If they aren't paying their players the owners are keeping the money and making more.  In all honesty, who would you rather see with money, the athletes that you're paying to see, the ones who are going out there everyday to play, to practice, spending half the year away from their families, or the owners who just sign paychecks?  I think they players deserve the money more than the owners do.<br>  <br>  You may want to compare them to average joes like us, but thats not the comparison to make, because regardless if Kobe makes more money or not, its not like we're going to benefit in any way.  The only people that would be affected would be Kobe and Jerry Buss.  The owners are already FAR richer than the players, so I don't blame the players for wanting to get paid, since its their performance thats making the owners billionaires.|`|21XmVm6Zaa	but then again they only play for what an avg of 10 yrs<br>  they arent going to be making that same amount of money forever<br>  but yeah they shouldnt complain if they are earning 5+ million a yr<br>  <br>  edit- but here's the question if you were talented enough to be in the nba, and as talented as kobe or lebron, dont tell me you would settle for 5 million a year ??|`|iGS5rXuHaa	I dont think anyone getting a contract should complain. There are plenty of people working themseleves to death to get noticed in hopes that one day they can get a contract, but we just have the super stars who do nothing but complain. it annoys me too.

FMEHpZZFaa	I am in your boat. I have had multiple surgeries on one knee and have a torn PCL in the other. I still practice TKD but I also practice Tai Chi. To answer your questions... Yes to everything. The one thing I had to relearn was balancing. Your knee joint and the surrounding muscle will be made weak by your surgery. Due to the weakness balance will be a real chore. Do your PT exercises and you should be fine in a short period of time depending on the amount of reconstruction/repair done.<br>  Once you begin to gain strength the balance will return, but you; like me, will have to watch out for low stances. They can be difficult with plastic and wires holding your joint together.<br>  One thing for sure.. Tai Chi always gives me a rush. It is very peaceful and relaxing to clear your mind and let go at the beginning of the day. It sets the mind and prepares it for the day.<br>  Hope this helps... Enjoy.|`|dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	Honestly it would depend on what your age is, the level of knee surgery you had and your overall ability to heal. I am not a doctor so I cannot give you medical advice but I can tell you that I have train many people who had knee surgery and they were all just fine. I have students who have had everything from a miniscus tear repair to full blown knee / ACL reconstruction done who are still training with me daily.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that they are ranging in age from 16 to 42 so I don't have any nor have trained anyone who has had knee surgery done over the age of 42. Our system is traditional Okinawa Karate and most of them are kicking just as well today as they were before the knee surgery. I always seek a 2nd opinion since most doctors are very opinionated, at least in my experience.|`|sJrnFCrgaa	Shihan J is right i just want to add that no matter what art you pursue you may have to favor your knee. One of the Risks of training is injury and working with an injury is something every martial artist has done.<br>  good luck to you.|`|RFXZbdPiaa	umm i hear a glock 17 is pretty effective on the streets 2|`|HlD9dRF2aa	Tai Chi is EXTREMELY dangerous to use on an opponent if you are proficient.<br>  <br>  Karate, Tae Kwon Do -- Kick, intimidate, bludgeon, fast as lightning.<br>  <br>  Tai Chi -- The objective is to 'rearrange or redirect a person's Chi energy'.  NOT A NICE THING TO DO (E.g. moving the stomach to where the heart is supposed to be or pushing them through a window with little or no effort.).  You see, most people don't understand that Tai Chi, despite being practiced by old people in parks all around China, has some very lethal applications.  With your background, it would be effective in finding those applications -- but it may be a challenge for you to learn because it is a 'soft' style.|`|YDpT2ClBaa	tai chi under a good instructor is good for self defense. but its not easy. nothing every worth training is easy.<br>  it is effective in the street but takes longer to become effective compared to karate.<br>  it is a great system and i would recommended it. <br>  <br>  depending on your instructor and style tai chi consists of strikes, throws, locks, etc.and is very effective once you have it down

mtIFZnsHaa	I have one and I like it.  I was surprised with it's accuracy.  It will kill small game.  It is a scope destroyer, though.  I've been thinking about another Gamo.  They have quite a good selection now.  The Whisper with the gas ram is supposed to be quieter with less recoil.  Gamo is also coming out with an "Extreme" CO2 rifle.  If I remember right it is 700fps in .22, and faster in .177.  The 88 gram CO2 cannisters are expensive, though.  Benjamin Discovery is also another PCP I am interested in. Check them all out on PyramydAir website.  The Shadow Sport is a good air rifle, though, especially for the price.|`|Es3XXoVsaa	Any air rifle with at least 700fps is fine.<br>  I have one that is ~755fps with BB's and 725ish with pellets.<br>  I do fine with it.|`|oSakZ1asaa	For the money, you will be 10x happier with the German made RWS 34.

I disagree with the above poster, you should not try small game hunting with anything less than 1000 fps for a quick humane kill. <br>  <br>  Anything less could just wound the critter!

Yes, LBJ23 does not have anyone that equate what M.J had in Pippen or what Magic had in Kareem. Also, I would be careful if I was you in listing Clyde as Hakeem's Robin cause Hakeem proved he could win a championship w.o Clyde. It was Clyde as a member of the Blazers who proved he could not win a title w.o Hakeem for his Blazers lost to the Bulls.<br>  <br>  However, Big Z and Mo are 2 serviceable Robin's and LBJ23 has the luxury of having 2 Robin's along w.<br>  <br>  Big Ben - A former multiple time DPOY and rebounding champion who has lost a step, but is still serviceable. More importantly he provides LBJ23 w. someone who has championship experience before. M.J. had Dennis who was a member of the Bad Boy Pistons only in his 2nd 3x peat years and had to win his first 3 w. players, like himself whom did not have title experience and the same can be said w. Hakeem. Magic had Kareem who won a title w. Big O in Milwaukee.<br>  <br>  Anderson Varejao - Good up and coming player<br>  <br>  Wally Szczerbiak - A proved 20+ PPG scorer off the bench who has lost a lot of steps, but can still shoot. In fact, they got 3 sharpshooters off the bench: Wally, Sasha, and Boobie.<br>  <br>  Joe Smith - Can do a bit of everything as can Sasha<br>  <br>  Plus, the team as a whole plays great defense and that is something every championship team needs.<br>  <br>  I think whomever wins the Cleveland-Atlanta series will represent the East in the NBA Finals and Atlanta despite what some ignorant people may think have a chance of doing the impossible and winning the series.|`|EKF2HdZKaa	Lebron can already do so much with less.

IWM1khX7aa	Lionel Messi is the best soccer player in the world. Sure he's young, but that doesn't mean he can't be the best, because the performance he has had this season is undescribable, which is proof of his greatness. CRonaldo is a great player too, and obviously as good as Messi, but his performance is just not like last season's, where it was no question he was the best. Tides have turned a little bit since then, and Messi seems more wiser and has played better than anyone else in the world. He's the main reason why Barcelona has been the best in the world this season. Last season, everyone thought Ronaldinho would be the best again, but he was too slow and wasn't good. <br>  <br>  Messi and Ronaldo have different/same attributes. Messi is a little faster with the ball, but Ronaldo has more skill. Ronaldo can also take a beautiful free kick. But Ronaldo is overrated and he's very selfish, also he dives a lot. Messi is not overrated, less selfish, and he hardly dives at all. If you think you've seen Messi at his prime, think again! He's going to get better and better until he starts to get old. By then, he would have accompished many things. Lionel Messi is less selfish and people know him as a great footballer. Girls like Ronaldo more because of his looks, which I do not like because I don't care if the best player is ugly. <br>  <br>  However, if either player wins the Champions League this year, one of them will be the best player in the world. Right now, I have to say Messi because he performs better, and he is better.|`|U23DRFtbaa	I hate Manchester United.So i like Messi<br>  <br>  <---------Liverpool Fans|`|4c479c9c27bebd404d7ba657763fe54faa	I prefer Messi over Ronaldo.

lKdLsRPDaa	XX cc XX, well it’s not as clear cut as that. I applaud the way Lawell has turned around our finances over the past 5 years or so, explored and exploited foreign markets, snagged very rewarding shirt and sponsorship deals, reduced debt and continued to turn in higher turnover and more profit. <br>  <br>  I am extremely pleased our club is being run correctly, especially with who knows what round the corner, in these times financial doom. <br>  <br>  What have Rangers done, they have went out, spent all that money, put themselves further in debt, to be what…runaway leaders, strolling to the title…no neither, they have overspent and lost out on vital income, just to be LEVEL with us. While we have hardly spent a penny. <br>  <br>   What annoys me is that we have not spent more wisely in player acquisitions, to effectively kill off Rangers for years to come, I felt it was vital that we further stretch our superiority off the field, to on it. In (not) doing so we have allowed Rangers to pretty much be neck and neck with us the whole season, clearly intimating that, we both have similar level of players, yet we had every opportunity to pull away on ability, level of players and stretch our title winning dominance, by buying some players of quality. <br>  <br>  As has been seen, Rangers summer transfers have only brought them to level with us, we were already ahead, yet we have failed miserably to further extend our dominance and superiority on the park. <br>  <br>  It really seems catch 22, I like the fact we are being run well and posting (year on year) excellent financial figures (certainly for a Scottish team) but feel we (Lawell) just doesn’t see the benefit of investing and extending our superiority, by spending more on players. I’m not saying we should just buy for the sake of it, but it has been clear to see that we needed, various players brought into the team, in various positions, to strengthen and essentially, dispose the current players in those positions, as far as I’m concerned we did not sign one player in the summer or January capable, of dislodging the current regular in his position.|`|h7GtCCC7aa	Would you rather be level on points in danger of losing the title or a couple of million in dept but having purchased a couple of decent players who would help win the league in January?<br>  <br>  Know what I would choose as a Celtic fan and any who disagree are talking bollocks<br>  <br>  Murray may be losing interest but he would never let Rangers go to the wall so I wouldn't worry about it.|`|lYkvps54aa	Rangers need a big cash investment from somewhere, a Russian billionaire perhaps.

Top of the league, and spent much more money than their so-called better off rivals Celtic over the last 8 months, and it's really beginning to show.  You keep up the number crunching mate, it will be a welcome distraction from Rangers winning the league.<br>  <br>  I wonder just how much longer people will believe anything Lawell has to say, that's 2 windows in a row he has talked big and did feck all, and will do the same this summer.<br>  <br>  Rangers will never go out of business, now, or in the near or distant future.  They are a national institution and treasure, with the best and most loyal support on the planet.<br>  <br>  We welcome the chase.<br>  <br>  You have to laugh at Jimmyhillsapoof.  Someone I have exposed as a bare-faced bigot on many an occasion, most recently less than a week ago.  Amazingly enough, the amount of violations I receive decreased dramatically when I barred his kind from answering my Q's, coincidence ? Don't think so.  A monotone, monumental bore, who's sole contibution to the forum is fantastical claims that Sir David Murray, and Rangers, are going out of business any minute now.   He knows this because he moves in the world of high finance, and has access to Sir David' Murray's bank account.  <br>  <br>  In reality, a bigoted ignoramus.   zzzzzzzzzzzzzz|`|bzwSCm6taa	sorry too busy laughing at william d......good one..<br>  <br>  <br>  no way are the gers going under..grasping at straws....see if you are still happy in may when you have good financial turnovers and no title....cheers..|`|57edf00d97af522b314c33475bf1e853aa	And u seriously think that Rangers will go Bankrupt?<br>  Absolutely no chance.|`|ePFdhsCYaa	Inaccurate figures mate.|`|BdiQPKn0aa	Stop dreaming Alex, Rangers are not gonna go bust

But here is what you do: you practice, practice, AND PRACTICE ! But other than that you need to train, you have to run a little every day, and like make that into a game for you and your friends so it isn't like running, like play tag or somthing like that ! I mean just train but have fun doing it ! I hope this helped ! Please vote me best answer !|`|HtYGxZcCaa	the only thing you can do is keep on practicing. Make sure you put all your effort into practice and practice you weaknesses and stuff that arent really your strong points so you can make them strengths. <br>  <br>  You also have to proper condition yourself too, you may hate running but you will have to run and do other workouts that will get you in shape|`|3267581d4fe0c877a2fee89c9c9a0c43aa	The only way to get better is to practice, and practice, and then practice some more...basic skills you can practice on your own, other skills you will need a partner, just tell them you need help and you're trying to get better.  As far as being hyper-competitive, try to tell yourself it's a game, not life-or-death, it sounds silly but it's what works for me.|`|Z5NvP7mkaa	Play catch with your friends or something AND PRACTICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you can read the rules or you can go to a batting cage and hit balls....|`|d3acaf600457d438c3379562a5eb82baaa	Practice! And try to get help from someone who knows what they're doing (like... a COACH) so you don't develop bad habits.

A great deal of anti-gun organizations went defunct last year and I don't even know how the hell you join the brady bastards. In fact the brady's had a forum.

People that do not own guns are afraid that if they have a gun in the house that someone might use it on them or a child will get a hold of it an accidentally pull the trigger. Yes I know there is a safety on them for that reason. They are also afraid of actually having to use one themselves. They don't understand the sport of hunting. Many think it is a big waste of time. It is ok to hunt for survival but just for fun is ridiculous. Non gun advocates do not think people should own guns for the mere fact that the playing field in an argument would be neutral. If you have a gun and I don't and we get into a heated argument and you decide to kill me even though I might have won the argument then what is stopping you from doing that other than it's against the law.|`|kOcBfbRraa	because on the whole, they are less intelligent, prone to violence, and need to cling to a medieval feeling that killing something or owning a gun makes them a man.<br>  <br>  Shows how small they really are.|`|yqx9YTBJaa	For the general population, they've been trained by Orwellian political speak and the public schools and media to fear them.

However, I know that some do not like guns because they are designed to have the potential to kill. Regardless of the reason, be it hunting, self-defense, or use in war, an honest person must admit guns have this ability. However, some people have very idealistic views and hopes for this country (or the world in general) and they do not like things that hurt their view. They believe that by removing things with such potential, the number of crimes and deaths would would drastically drop... even though mankind did such crimes long before guns were created. By placing the blame on things such as guns instead of the people, they can keep the idealistic views of the world.<br>  <br>  Also, some people have very little experience with guns. The majority of people only know what they see in movies and see/read in the news. Movies usually only show guns as a method of murder or as a tool to acquire vengeance. News papers and news shows on the television often only speak of guns when they are related to a crime. My local news stations will not mention any sort of target-shooting competitions in my area. However, they will not hesitate to show recorded videos of confiscated firearms (even if the footage is from archives and is unrelated) on the evening news when a gun-related crime or murders occurs. I am not saying that the two events are of the same importance. However, if they only see the negative events and do not see any of fun events, they will learn to hate guns.<br>  <br>  well, that is my $0.02|`|72b1b35e81e7d39e237e18972e90ad30aa	First of all to all the gun haters...Its the crazy person that kills not the gun...When was the last time a normal sane person decided to shoot up the place..examples...My gosh lets think 9/11...im sure those airplanes had a mind of there own..or was it the crazeies controling them?...<br>  <br>  second of all..hunting.....or hunters...Thank god that each state has a department that called..Department of envirmental conservation...If you are a hater..Read about those departments in each state before you slam anyone including the state you live in that controls the habitat and the envirmental laws that EVERYONE must adhere too...Not just hunters...|`|9NcOBG8Laa	Because despite over 1,500,000 crimes being intervened by non-military, non-police, law-abiding citizens with guns each year, the only thing the media does is report the approximate 150 kids that are killed by firearms annually.|`|f3f63c87e27f64c3e9f1679c165409b8aa	Your right Joseph!!!

Misuse doesn't turn us off to automobiles, though they kill far more people than do guns. And some people need killing, so that's certainly no reason to hate guns. Neither is a rational answer to the question.|`|cc20d7392e0d4d3d05ba6de3941f41b1aa	Hate comes from fear.  The people who hate all hunters and gun owners fear what they do not understand.  They can  only see in their mind's eye the stereotype of the ultra-survivalists and private "militias", the rural rube whom TV and movies has long depicted as ignorant, and wanting to kill anything that's "not from around here."  They have never understood the long tradition and heritage of the art and beauty of living  off of what God has put on this earth.  Sure you can go buy meat in a store, but you can also save thousands of dollars by going out hunting and fishing, and get to breathe the pure air for awhile too.|`|AA11570394	The first two answers clearly show the ignorance of those people. Animals do indeed kill for fun, just watch a cat with a mouse or bird. I have seen fox, coyotes and wolves kill for fun. But hunters kill for food or to reduce troublesome varmints.<br>  Also car kill far more people than guns why not be afraid of those crazy car owners?<br>  <br>  What we have here is people going by what they hear or are told and the media is a major reason for the dis-information, propaganda and lies. I live near a vast wildness area in Alaska so I am around wild animals all the time. Similar to some one in the Midwestern states or the Deep South who live around nature. But people who live in the city and can only look at animals on TV or the zoo are detached from nature and therefore depend on what their media, teachers and friends tell them.<br>  Humans are afraid of what they don’t understand. I see genuine fear in the eyes of some tourists when they look at locals packing firearms, it scares them. But for the locals its nothing to see a stranger with a gun on their hip. This fear that they have is played on by the media and politicians. To show how detached they can be Obama’s wife was traveling though a rural area where towns were small and she commented she could see the need for a gun in such remote areas where 911 is long to respond. She how she ignores the need for others to own guns? It’s an alien thing to her and them.<br>  <br>  So I hope I answered your question.

People are afraid of guns because they don't understand that, while deadly if used incorrectly, guns are a hobby for many people and are perfectly safe in the hands of law abiding citizens.|`|ZzR63qYRaa	Because most of them don't understand why the right to bear arms is in the constitution.They think that guns are evil and they believe what ever they see on TV or in the newspaper, and they never have anything positive about guns or hunting.I wonder what would happen if Oprah said she thinks that more people would carry guns,I don't think it would get broad casted.The bottom line is the gov doesn't want us to have guns so they have the media only have negative story's about guns and hunting.|`|AA11826768	They don,t understand the cycle of life. How the higher on the food chain you are the more your hunting instincts drive you. These same people would say if a animal kills a human it is just nature.

DvNZr4TAaa	A few notes:<br>  -Kurt Angle is the U.S. Champion<br>  -Bret Hart is the World Heavyweight Champion<br>  -Te Hart Foundation (Bret Hart, Owen Hart, Jim Neidhart, and "Davey Boy Smith" British Bulldog) are re-united<br>  -Team Angle (Kurt Angle, Shelton Benjamin, and Charley Haas) are <br>  re-united<br>  <br>  <br>  RAW airs live from Calgary, Alberta, Canada, home of Bret Hart. He comes out and talks about how great it is to be performing in his home city. He talks to the crowd(obviously most of them would be Canadian, and therefore, Hart fans) about being a proud Canadian. He says he'd rather fight for the Maple Leaf than for The Stars and Stripes. He goes on to talk about Canada and Kurt Angle's music hits, cutting Bret off mid-sentance. He says he can understand Bret being a proud Canadian, but he should still respect America because, when it comes right down to it, the company that signs his paycheck is American based. Bret tells him to prove his patriotism and face him later in the main event. So the main event comes around and Kurt Angle comes out first, followed by Bret Hart. The match starts and the crowd is behind Bret the whole time. Both men hit their respective finishers a few times, but in the end, Bret Hart hits the Sharp Shooter and forces Kurt to tap out. Weeks go by with the feud continuing mainly on the microphone and sometimes in a fight but there are no matches held. It is announced at the Royal Rumble there will be a Sixty Minute Iron-Man Match. The match goes with Kurt scoring the first point. Bret soon answers the point and the match always tied or in a difference of one. The sixty minuites ends with the score tied. Kurt hits the Angle Slam and the Ankle Lock and wins the match. In the month leading up to No way Out, a four on three handicap match is announced with it being The Hart Foundation versus Team Angle. Of course, The Hart Foundation pulls out the victory. In the months leading up to WrestleMania 25, a Three Stages of Hell match is announced. The first match is a Thirty Minuite Submission Match, which Kurt Angle wins. The second match is a flag match, with Kurt defending the American Flag and Bret Hart defending the Canadian Flag. Bret Hart wins the match by retreiving Hert's Canadian Flag. He then rudely picks his nose with it, throws it to the floor and stomps on it right in front of Bret. The last match is a ladder match for both U.S. and World Heavywheight Cmapionships. The match is very long and exciting with alot of back and forth action but Kurt Angle gets the win and is the first Superstar to hold the U.S. and World Heavywheight Championships at the same time.|`|RUrHwts8aa	I don't know about all the confrontations or anything, but it would definitely be a Submission match.

Keep Manny,|`|9dvmMRX4aa	DO IT!!!|`|LtOxnF0kaa	Dont do it|`|ifiukIvDaa	first off, if you think your team does not have a very good chance, take the dollar, plus youre not losin much.<br>  A-rod played most of last year with a similar cist, and he did fine.  plus, he will not get surgery and manny wont keep producing the way he did for an entire season|`|f4ea933ff2710d6621207b1fad09d53aaa	a rod faces a daisuke, josh beckett, scott kazmir and all everyday, even though he gets homeruns...he faces hard pitching almost every game, and manny faces for the most part pretty weak pitchers...so manny is more potent and he has the division and his team's schedule on his side|`|1ymODMGvaa	take the trade arod is amazing<br>  and better then ramirez!|`|AA10517199	no keep manny. a rod will be out a while and manny will produce in LA.|`|3Q9eWun9aa	no a-rod is hurt manny is the man this year....dont do it...arod has to have surgery|`|0kEc1aJgaa	no dont do it, you cant trust Arods issue's this year,|`|OBcvu93uaa	I wouldn't. There is no word out there right now on A-Rod's injury, so....it could be a bad risk.|`|LRt6gaXJaa	I would do it.  Manny's numbers won't be as good as last year's.  A-Rod will miss a few weeks, but he'll be strong in the late part of the season, when fantasy baseball is won or lost.  You're not going to win your league with Guillen on your roster.<br>  <br>  Plus, you get a $1!  That's 20% back on your initial investment.  Maybe ask him for $2 or $1.50.<br>  <br>  Great fantasy baseball move, great moneyball move!

aZX8ltttaa	Mate, you obviously are just a lover of the game. You clearly have no preference for the level of quality or team you enjoy watching. This is not a bad thing, in fact you probably enjoy the premier league more than others as you have no particular loyalty to any one team and can therefore judge performances in an unbiased manner.<br>  <br>  There is no problem with it, but if u do begin to support one team i would recommend LIVERPOOL, thought Im slightly biased ;)|`|a3y63ODRaa	well mate youve gotta make a decision whether to support a team or not. you might like them so watch a few games of those teams and decide who you like most based on their style of play and their players :)<br>  PS: (you know its chelsea!!) haha XD<br>  yeah you can love footie and not support anyone its normal :)|`|toW3SdxWaa	ha|`|p8lB73rdaa	One team and one team only bud .<br>  My advice , stick with Chelsea !|`|mX0qaX3Eaa	Not weird but you don't 'support' any of them. It's pretty normal to like players and wear various shirts as a kid, but as you get older you should pick your team and stick with them.|`|8caee7090c48436f326e0f2dd5b622d6aa	take no notice of some of your answers... if you love football and want to sample different teams and stadiums you go and enjoy yourself .. i've gone to many a game as a neutral ...i've done it this season if you love football in general there is nothing wrong with going around as a neutral...|`|oPYw0QYqaa	I think you are clearly not that passionate about football....

yRT5HjF0aa	I 100% agree with you. While it would be nice to make the playoffs after 4 years of not making it, where it that going to take us? Unless we have a Cinderella Stanley Cup run, it is highly unlikely we will win the Stanley Cup, or even make it past the first round for that matter. <br>  <br>  And even if we win all these games it is not guaranteed we will make it.  We are nine points out of a playoff spot and if the Leafs really pushed all I could see would be them ending up in ninth...again. It didn't work the past 3 years...why would it work now? Especially when we lost out Captain, and two of our better players.  <br>  <br>  I would like to see the Leafs come down to the bottom 5, I realize that getting Tavares is probably out of our grasp but I would like to see us get Brayden Schenn. <br>  <br>  One last thing, I do want to see this team lose but not if it means the team is purposely losing and throwing away games, I would never condone that.|`|ys3DHzDuaa	I think it would be best if you guys head into rebuilding mode.  Whats the point of making the playoffs?  So you guys can lose in the 1st round (no offense).  The Leafs are a mess but at least some effort was made at the trade deadline to get picks for their rebuilding process.  <br>  <br>  The only problem i see though for the Leafs now is Gerber.  This is the perfect situation for him.  There are no expectations or pressure for him which is usually the time he plays his BEST hockey.  His showing the other night was just Gerber playing his game with nothing to worry about.  Maybe if the Toronto media starts up with the Stanley Cup stories he'll fold and you'll be exactly where you want come draft day! :)|`|2iuZdBXraa	F.McF - the stereotypical arrogant Habs fan.  Just another reason to dislike Montreal.|`|kOcBfbRraa	Oh wake up Leafs fans !!! The owners do not care if they make the playoffs.......they get $$$ from TV revenue and from merchandising and the morons in T.O. keep (and have kept) FILLING maple leaf gardens and the ACC. So why should they bother to spend $$ or players to make the playoffs for the enjoyment and personal enrichment of sad-sack die-hard Toronto fans. <br>  <br>  It doesn't even matter if they get "a good draft pick" because they will never assemble and/or keep enough young talent to grow into a contender, let alone a winner. It's funny though......some fans are content with "making the playoffs".<br>  <br>  IF YOU WOULD STAY AWAY FROM THE ARENA AND HAVE IT 50% EMPTY (I GUESS IT WOULD STILL BE 50% 'FULL' FOR YOU OPTIMISTS LOL) EVERY SINGLE NIGHT YOU MIGHT MAKE MANAGEMENT REALIZE THAT YOU WILL NOT SUPPORT A LACKLUSTER EFFORT !!!!!

IS PRETTY OBVIOS BY THE WAY.|`|fuYYRJXtaa	1st of all.  He's a great player but he's definitely not the best in the NBA.<br>  <br>  He'd probably be scoring 26 to 28 points a game without KG & Allen.|`|JD3yWKNGaa	I love Paul Pierce. I don't think he would be scoring 50 points a game without Ray Allen and KG, but pretty close. He was the star of the Celtics before they started winning games. No one knew who he was before except die hard C's fans. I like LeBron James, but he is not the best in the NBA, if he was he would have a ring! Kobe Bryant is the most overrated player in the NBA. Paul Pierce is The Truth!|`|vltWIUh9aa	nooo b4 they came to his team the cletics werent tht good and thers plenty of other players who can contain him if they werent also worried bout kg or allen|`|BIoZnAgoaa	If he's so good then why wasn't he scoring 50 a game when he didnt have Garnett and Allen?|`|yO4vhNM9aa	not exactly|`|GfOR2H0kaa	No hes not <br>  <br>  50 yeah right|`|VG7k5QRFaa	Dwyane Wade is the best player in the NBA right now, but he just doesn't have a good team.  When Pierce had a good team and had Antoine Walker as a co-star, the Nets whipped Boston.  Oh, don't get me wrong, Pierce is a great player, but he isn't in the top 5.  Pierce is an All Star, but no one can mistake him for a superstar.  Super stars make teams better, they carry the team on their backs when necessary, some make their teams better but that isn't always the case, they can break the defense of the opposing team alone (mostly) and they have moments when they are completely unstoppable.<br>  <br>  Here are some examples of superstars:<br>  <br>  1. Dwyane Wade (He is everything for his team including blocking shots, scoring, stealing, rebounding, etc.  The man is a machine.)<br>  <br>  2. Kobe Bryant (Is a lethal scoring machine.  Is unstoppable at times... just like Wade.  Kobe also has good defense as well.)<br>  <br>  3. LeBron James (Powers his way to the basket using a combination of strength and skill.  His ability to finish and get good shots is exceptional.  Can also hook up his teammates as well.  He carried his team to the Finals one year, alone.)<br>  <br>  4. Allen Iverson (in his prime. He didn't make players better, but that wasn't from lack of trying.  He gave a whole heap of assists and carried his team to the Finals and kept them on the top of the league for years.  In his prime, most couldn't guard him without fouling him.  His only lack was defense, but in his case, he more than made up for it by averaging a whopping 30 pts or more in games.  He basically won games himself.)<br>  <br>  5. Chris Paul (Hasn't done much yet, but has carried his team for 2 years before he got recognition.  His speed confounds the defense of opponents and he can score or pass easily)<br>  <br>  <br>  Here are some examples of All Stars:<br>  <br>  1. Chauncey Billups (Is pretty good defensively and offensively, and his shots go in easily but he can be stopped alone.)<br>  <br>  2. Dirk Nowitzki (He was close in his prime, but...even with a great team he still lost and couldn't get to the next level)<br>  <br>  3. Steve Nash (Yeah, he carried the team in Phoenix, but it was the system.  He was paired with Dirk Nowitzki and Micheal Finley in Dallas and was not able to dominate.  That's not to say he wasn't good...I'm just saying he wasn't a super star.)<br>  <br>  4. Stephon Marbury (People hate him, but Marbury, Allen Iverson, Tracy McGrady, Antonio McDyess and Vince Carter were all on the path to becoming legends.  They just weren't on very good teams.  Oh and before people start saying he it was his attitude...1. That's what guys say to excuse their own bad play for instance on the Nets he scored 50 points to Shaq's 30 and Kobe's 20 and his team still lost.  On Phoenix, Amare Stoudamire was injured and the GM didn't get help.  He waited till Marbury was gone to add Quentin Richardson, Joe Johnson and other players...when Steve Nash was there.  Marbury was a lethal slasher to the basket and a great assist leader averaging 20 points and 6-8 assists a game.  But he was an All Star...but was close to being a super star.)<br>  <br>  5. Vince Carter (Legendary dunks, unstoppable on his way to the basket, etc.)<br>  <br>  6. Amare Stoudamire<br>  <br>  7. Tracy McGrady<br>  <br>  8. Paul Pierce (Is very VERY good.  But is still an All Star.  Didn't carry his team as well as the super stars did.  Even with Walker's help he couldn't beat the Nets, who had no superstar...only 5 all stars--Jason Kidd, Richard Jefferson, Kenyon Martin, Kerry Kittles, Keith Van Horn.  LeBron is a handful for Boston and they have 3 All Stars.  Garnett and Ray Allen are all stars as well.  Garnett was also close to being a superstar, but there was something missing from his game in Minnesota and he couldn't cross the line.  Ray Allen was an exceptional shooter but a super star is much more than that.  Pierce is good, but he needed two more all stars to make him look like a super star, so no he isn't the best player in the NBA.)|`|NOK8lxP0aa	um no!! u cant be serious, the best player in the nba, haha.. yea right, hes not consistent and w/out kg and allen he would lose!!

We have two or 3 different teams within this squad and that is what makes them strong. In the earlier days we sometimes had the starting team and a couple of reserves and that was it. While they didn't always win all before them, they played with guts in an all or nothing manner playing with injuries that would keep today's players out for weeks on end. certainly if they can pull of the Premier League title or CL along with the FA Cup one would have to give them due consideration.|`|iA5kZv15aa	I'm a completely neutral Newcastle fan and will give my honest opinion.<br>  No, I think this team is not as good as the Cantona era Manchester United teams and certainly not as good as the Liverpool teams of the 70's and 80's.<br>  I think Man Utd's current dominance is more to do with a lack of quality in other teams rather than in them being the greatest English side ever.|`|6aKd0Kcjaa	no.like wenger said even if utd win all 5 trophies it still doesn't match the invincible team,now that was the greatest club team in any league that was ever seen,besides you haven't won anything of note yet so don't get on your high horses bragging after beating ful who weren't at the races ham.|`|HxHAzMeMaa	Well as a Man U supporter I'm gonna say maybe, IF they win the FA cup, Champions League and the Premiership.

If we win pretty much all the trophies, we will be the most successful club in a single season. Would that qualify as the best English team ever?

sxPWhid9aa	I say the Philadelphia Eagles for the NFC because DeSean Jackson will emerge and become their #1 receiver as their fans have all wanted for so long. Donovan McNabb has two great receivers to throw to (Kevin Curtis & DeSean Jackson). Brian Westbrook will come back from an injury plagued season. The Eagles lost two aging tackles which won't hurt because they picked up Stacy Andrews (mammoth of a guy at 6-7, 345) and I expect them to address the other tackle position in the draft (they have two first round selections). Brent Celek is a reliable option at tight end although his blocking needs to be touched up on. As far as defense is concerned, they have a great defensive line (always one of the top leaders in sacks every season) and they are strong against the run with a HUGE linebacking core. Stewart Bradley (6-4, 255), Chris Gocong (6-2, 263), and Akeem Jordan (6-1, 235). They secondary is strong with Samuel and Sheldon Brown at the corners and Quintin Mikell at strong safety and I expect them to address the other safety position in the draft with the loss of Brian Dawkins. <br>  <br>  On AFC, I pick the New England Patriots because Tom Brady will be back. Pure and simple, when you have Tom Brady on your team, whether coming off a torn ACL or not, you are going to be a winning organization. Their defense is getting up there in years somewhat and their secondary is questionable but, hey, they pulled it off last year. They offensive line is one of the best in the NFL with Matt Light leading the way. Randy Moss still has a good five years left in him. Wes Welker is the best receiver on the team, though. <br>  <br>  Rematch of Super Bowl 39.

Not gonna happen.|`|KmMRHKTNaa	Messi, if he wants to go i think he would like to go to another big club, not a bad club like man city. But i doubt barca will sell the best player in the world, there is no bigger club then barca at the moment.<br>  <br>  If i where man city, i would invest that money on the youth systems. Thats where we find the great players.

p6GGoFDsaa	Rob Van Dam and Bret Hart are my two favourites of all time.<br>  <br>  They obviously both had incredible atheleticism and skill when they were wrestling, but what set them apart for me was the fact that they had a real passion for the business, which you could see whenever they performed. They always gave it their best, never used to be sloppy or lazy in the ring, and made sure they gave the fans what they wanted; a good match.|`|5Rbua5Wbaa	Jeff Hardy-When I got into wrestling again as i got a little older[i used to watch when i was 4 but later stopped before i was 5, then started liking again a few years ago] any who, I was on the computer at the same time and I wasn't interested much, then I heard his music and I said to myself, that sounds cool, then he came out, and i was like, oh my god he is gorgeous, then he started wrestling and I loved his wrestling style, and I looked up stuff about him, and I found out he does art, makes music, etc. and I just loved him after that.<br>  <br>  Edge-I didn't like him when i got into wrestling[again] then when Vengeance came to houston in 07 I wanted him to beat batista, soon I started finding him cute, then I saw him wrestle in person, and I loved watching him in person<br>  <br>  Bottom Line, THEIR AWESOME!!!!!!!|`|yKHMQxK1aa	Jeff has a distinct personality and is not afraid to be himself. He's also very impressive in the ring. Now lets see how many people say I suck because I said Jeff Hardy. <br>   I also was really starting to like Evan Bourne, but then he got injured so it's too hard to tell about him yet. But incase you haven't noticed, I like highflyers because their impressive.|`|QZUBVCJfaa	my favourite wrestlers is Batista because if you are one of his fans they you know that he's half Greek and Filipino and I'm a filipino.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Batista#Early_life" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Batist...</a>|`|rARzCQlMaa	CARLITO BECAUSE HE IS HOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...<br>  <br>  REY MYSTERIO BECAUSE HE IS MEXICAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|IMJp1HhZaa	DDP - Because He's ******* Mental XD<br>  Eddie Guerrero - Soooooo Funny|`|ULSUqmeZaa	Triple H during DX. I love DX.|`|ipJKJoBNaa	HBK <br>  FOR SOME REASON HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY FAVE =D|`|gXHxf2G9aa	The Undertaker is my favourite.  When he first came into the WWE I was very doubtful of his abilities.  Traditionally, the "big dark guy" has had very little skill and only had a brief lifespan.  Thankfully the Undertaker didn't fall into that category and won matches using pure talent and continued to fascinate the fans.  I just loved to watch him in the ring and when you think his number is up he seems to dig deep down and pull out a win.<br>  <br>  And that's why I love, admire and respect my favourite wrestler the Undertaker :)|`|AA11482019	AJ Styles for is phenomenal matches.|`|PyJ3PMRnaa	Edge because of his style, the way he wrestles, when he sees an opportunity, he takes it like when he attacked Kofi Kingston at No Way Out and won the World Heavyweight title, and when he cashed in the Money In The Bank World title match on a beaten Undertaker after he defended his World title in a hellacious Steel Cage Match with Batista and was attacked by a returning Mark Henry and became the World Heavyweight Champion. He's just so great.|`|quzXdf8gaa	Shawn Michaels is my favorite superstar because he has had such a historic career. To have started out as a young adult and trying to make something of himself in the pro wrestling business to becoming one of the greatest the business has ever seen.

But when he was around he was one of the most athletic and unorthodox wrestlers with some of the moves he would pull off.  And he could sell a move as good as anyone I ever saw.

EgLdNAusaa	Practice dribbling the ball until you can handle the ball without ever looking at it. This will also allow you to see what is going on on the floor and give you the confidence that nobody can take the ball form you.  Work on your shot until you feel like everything you shoot is going to go in.  In other words, put useful practice into the time you train.  "It's not the number of hours that you put in, but what you put in to the number of hours"|`|yO4vhNM9aa	what a stupid question, you go on to yahoo answers and ask how to be confident, wow nobody will want to be with you, <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  TAKE IT  OUT AND DO SOME WINDMILL DUNKS IN PRACTICE TO GIVE YOU SOME CONFIDENCE (LOL)|`|1DL9pUsEaa	if im about to play a nerve racking game, i listen to music before i play, just chill out really, play to your strengths and DONT ACT NERVOUS! good luck|`|ncOFFRbCaa	Play to your strengths, if your not all that good at shooting pass the ball to a open teammate and rack up some assist if you are a good shooter dont be afraid to shoot because ppl are watching it'll throw your game off|`|ghLcOsnnaa	practice to get better
rjuqrHK7aa	I know that Reds put a 60 pitch limit on their pitchers.<br>  <br>  They told the coaches of each contry to follow this limit.|`|yk4S7uuraa	The pitch count is important as its early in the spring. <br>  <br>  Most of the pitchers aren't ready to be stretched out beyond 50-60 pitches prior to the last week of spring training, which won't be until March 29.|`|kHYRznVBaa	Technically NONE; however, in the new era of the game,with specialists', at "Middle relieving, and "Closers", you'll see that managers start watching the starter around the 75 to 80 pitch mark, depending on how well things are going...  The Amercian League is more likely to have pitchers go the distance too; as the manager's arent' forced to make desicions that require a "Doulbe Switch" or "Pinch hitter" as the pitcher, (Pitcher's aren't usually known for they're hitting skills), DON'T have to go to the plate, so they're more likely to be taken out in later innings as a strategic move.

Kennedy, CM Punk, MVP, Shelton Benjamin, Miz, Morrison are all good possibilities too.<br>  <br>  The Hardyz are expected to have a match<br>  <br>  a 25 Diva Battle Royal is scheduled, and have contacted many former Divas to take part such as Jackie Gayda, Sunny, Mae Young, Lita, Trish Stratus, among others,.<br>  <br>  Jack Swagger vs. Tommy Dreamer for the ECW Title has also been talked about, but Christian may be used instead of Dreamer<br>  <br>  I was notified late last night that there has been some informal dialogue between Hulk Hogan and WWE about the possibility of him working a match at WrestleMania. However, no creative plans have been made. Hogan reportedly pitched the idea of working a match against John Cena. <br>  <br>  Stone Cold has also been rumored working a match against Hulk Hogan, but Hogan has had back issued recently and may be unable to work. Austin is prominently featured in WrestleMania 25 advertisements so I think he will at least appear on the show, the night after he is inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. <br>  <br>  <br>  Plans for Chris Jericho are still up in the air but i was told it will involve the angle with the legends. Mickey Rourke vs. Jericho was obviously the plan a couple of weeks ago but there has been concern from both Rourke and WWE about how it would go over. WWE officials are said to be concerned that it would be too big of a risk.<br>  <br>  Melina vs. Beth Pheonix looks likely for the Women's championship, but they may not have that on the card. Something involving Maryse/McCool may happen too. <br>  <br>  JBL was also scheduled win the IC title from CM Punk in the coming weeks, but due to the script being leaked, that may now have changed, but JBL was planned to make history by having the IC defended at WM<br>  <br>  These are the plans as of now, but Vince has been described as being "obsessed" with keeping things from leaking (see No Way out - using a curtain over the chamber pre=show to prevent knowledge of Edge being in both chambers) Plus plans change all the time, but these are what are known now.<br>  <br>  If you haven’t already, sign up to swag bucks and WIN SWAGS and FREE PRIZES<br>  <br>  <a href="http://mywwesearch.swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb-register&rb=145837" rel="nofollow">http://mywwesearch.swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb...</a><br>  <br>  Just search as you would every day, but WIN SWAG BUCKS as a BONUS<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|ULSUqmeZaa	Ya, Big Show spoiled it this morning in an interview on VH1.|`|mKtGiuyZaa	Of Course CENA WILL BE APART OF WM DUH|`|qwdh7N6saa	yes|`|E7TkNO00aa	Definitely, I knew it ever since Monday on Raw when Edge got disqualified on purpose.

UWJinEbIaa	Christian had to leave WWE because he would never be given a shot at the World Title.  WWE only wanted HHH, Orton, Batista, Cena, JBL as champions and there was no room form Christian because of the "politics" and other perceived reasons like his size.  Christian would be stuck in the middle doing nothing like Shelton Benjamin who is a talented wrestler but has perceived weakness keeping him from breaking the glass ceiling.<br>  <br>  Edge vs Christian would be more entertaining and interesting because they are better talkers.  After the the hiatus in Florida....Christian is now accepted as a top guy.  His return to the company was in a championship feud.   That shows that he is worthy of being a main eventer on Raw or Smackdown.|`|05RmoBJ6aa	It really depends. Actually I'm pretty sure most people were pushing him to carry the company like Edge is doing now. It's only Vince who is the major road block in his career. Vince McMahon apparently never saw Christian Cage as a main-eventer, EVER. I've read somewhere that Vince thinks Christian is the personification of vanilla and that he has no star aura whatsoever. <br>  <br>  Of course it's hard to agree with him since CCage is one of the most over superstars today and every promotion in the world would chomp at the bit to get him. <br>  <br>  Paul London once said that Vince McMahon isn't really in tune with what the audience wants and is too rooted in his own ways to accept something even though it's good for business. The Christian issue is just a testament to this.|`|B9h6VhQOaa	no because wwe didn't see his whole potential then he went to tna to prove himself to the wwe. he proved he could be a great main eventer and wwe saw that. so then they wanted him back so hopefully he might win MITB or get drafted. he needs to get outta ecw<br>  BQ an edge vs christian would be a better feud because in my opinion they messed up on the hardy vs hardy fued|`|qwdh7N6saa	Christian should be headlining WM25. then being on ECW. He should be on smackdown or raw.|`|XYOkHeqsaa	then he would not be misused like he is now|`|Q1MI6L96aa	His worth to the company by returning is more than if he stayed; ECW is a reclamation project, so he is poised in a win-win situation...is the brand fails, it was supposed to...if it blips upward, he is one of the major reasons why. He left because of the TNA upside, which is crashing quickly due to flat ratings and contract renewals being for significantly lesser money. <br>  <br>  Hardy v Hardy is a secondary plot to the McMahon Family....it was never going to be the focal point, though it briefly had potential.

SuXAhw1eaa	yay i'd say the jets but i guarentee you by time the season starts they will have a big name behind the offense line.|`|GPNeydmgaa	Try the Vikings. They have a great team, except for the QB position. No, Rosenfels is not the answer.|`|IOpOEMnQaa	yeah the jets at least the lions have Culpepper which is at least a safe guard to some extent and Drew Stanton who could be a great player when he finally gets his shot|`|AA12105360	Denver|`|QvbvhXbSaa	I think the 49ers have the biggest QB problem because Shaun Hill had a TERRIBLE year last year|`|rV4uJVWmaa	For once not the Falcons! Feels good to say that.|`|3dpdQssvaa	great|`|AA11760438	49ers<br>  <br>  Who is their Starter?|`|7obFZ2Gyaa	The Niners had QB Shaun Hill who  played  great at the end of  the season.    The Vikings, LIONS  or Bears have the worst QB situation because it's  obvious to me that  Tarvares Jackson can't play QB  he's like the Bills Jp Losman.   PLays great  makes a few  good  plays then he fades away.     My final answer is  Detroit Lions . They  picked  up  Culpepper from the street and  Dan  "I don't know where the end zone ENDS " Orlovsky is  not the answer either.    The Lions better draft  a QB in the draft  otherwise they might as well  have the Pistons  play for them.|`|QjO3m7QKaa	Vikings, Jets, Lions, and the Bucs. <br>  You're saying the Bears aren't set with QB? C'mon Kyle Orton got them 9 wins, and got them 11 wins in his rookie season. He got injured thats why he declined but he'll be better and healthy next season.|`|Cy2pwXzzaa	Jets, Farve really screwed them over.  big mistake by Jets|`|9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	Well....how did that Favre thing work out, exactly like the Packers knew it would. I agree with the Vikings, Jets and 49ers all having problems and good thing you brought up the Bucs & Bears but the list doesnt end there. What about the Lions? Redskins? Bills? Rams? All those have pretty serious issues too and there seems to be questions in Cleveland whether any of their guys fit the offense, Carolina needs to start thinking about a replacement for Delhomme, the Cardinals need to think of life after Warner (they dont seem to think Leinhart is the guy), the Raiders need production out of Russell or need to re-think their QB situation and the Jags have to ask if Garrard can take them the extra mile. Lots more teams with QB problems than ones that are real happy about theirs. Half the league cant be satisfied they have a QB that can lead them far into the playoffs.|`|nfLd3ngraa	The Detroit lions. Ok i know they have daunte culpepper but have you guys seen how these guy has played recently. Last year he was worst in my opinion then joey harrington. Also they have Drew Stanton as there backup, who has only took a few snaps in his career. This is clearly on of the worst quarterbacking teams. Its so bad i was mad that they got rid of Orlovsky he was the only one who did decent for us last year. As far as that goes i would rather have Clemens at least he won them a game. Also the viks just got that guy from the texans and have two solid backups behind him. Shaun hill was also decent for the 49ers so, i think they might be alright.|`|vnzSTerjaa	i think shorter answer would be "which teams have a good QB situation?" its all a big mess rite now, id say all teams besides the chargers, ravens, patriots, falcons, colts, giants, steelers, and dolphins have bad situations<br>  <br>  PS why do ppl think the panthers need a new QB to replace jake delhomme? he had one bad game? i think im gona post that question rite now...|`|j5vHW6wMaa	the 49ers are fine they just signed the solid veteran damon huard he will be their opening day starter<br>  <br>  the vikings are ok sage rosenfells played well in houston<br>  <br>  the bears are ok kyle orton led them to above .500 last year nearly playoffs<br>  <br>  the bucs or jets kyle boller and rex grossman will find starting jobs on those two teams, id say rex with the jets boller with the bucs|`|GUjr6whNaa	Idk i would day the vikings but he is heavily underrated he did have an avg of like 111 in 4/6 games i think he will improve<br>  <br>  Id say the 49ers are having one of the roughest qb situations (even tho i do like JT)|`|wGO7thhwaa	how bout the freaking philadelphia eagles.<br>  mcnabb wont sign until the jackas of a front office in philly gets him a WR, and they wont.<br>  what do we have after that, kevin kolb.<br>  kevin kolb|`|XZTwrn2Qaa	The 49ers arnt doin bad.

ZdNSSm0waa	Basketball: December 21, 1891, in Springfield, USA<br>  NBA: November 1, 1946, in New york|`|vbAu5SY3aa	History of Basketball <br>  Dr. James Naismith, Inventor of Basketball<br>  KU Basketball Program Founder<br>   <br>  Dr. James Naismith is known world-wide as the inventor of basketball. He was born in 1861 in Ramsay township, near Almonte, Ontario, Canada. The concept of basketball was born from Naismith's school days in the area where he played a simple child's game known as duck-on-a-rock outside his one-room schoolhouse. The game involved attempting to knock a "duck" off the top of a large rock by tossing another rock at it. Naismith went on to attend McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. <br>  <br>  After serving as McGill's Athletic Director, James Naismith moved on to the YMCA Training School in Springfield, Massachusetts, USA in 1891, where the sport of basketball was born. In Springfield, Naismith was faced with the problem of finding a sport that was suitable for play inside during the Massachusetts winter for the students at the School for Christian Workers. Naismith wanted to create a game of skill for the students instead of one that relied solely on strength. He needed a game that could be played indoors in a relatively small space. The first game was played with a soccer ball and two peach baskets used as goals. Naismith joined the University of Kansas faculty in 1898, teaching physical education and being a chaplain.|`|EgLdNAusaa	December 1891, Springfield, Mass.

However, no creative plans have been made. Hogan reportedly pitched the idea of working a match against John Cena. <br>  <br>  Stone Cold has also been rumored working a match against Hulk Hogan, but Hogan has had back issued recently and may be unable to work. Austin is prominently featured in WrestleMania 25 advertisements so I think he will at least appear on the show, the night after he is inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. <br>  <br>  <br>  Plans for Chris Jericho are still up in the air but i was told it will involve the angle with the legends. Mickey Rourke vs. Jericho was obviously the plan a couple of weeks ago but there has been concern from both Rourke and WWE about how it would go over. WWE officials are said to be concerned that it would be too big of a risk.<br>  <br>  Melina vs. Beth Pheonix looks likely for the Women's championship, but they may not have that on the card.

x6uCeQ5Aaa	Thats a tough situation and I feel for you! I would say that if if playing softball is affecting you emotionally then it might be in your best interest to quit. Try talking to your teacher and tell her that playing the game is going to affect your studies and tell her it is nothing personal. There is no use in spending a ton of your time doing something you absolutely hate. Tell your mom that you don't want to make her disappointed in you but this is something you have to do. I hope this helps you!|`|6zWsrK0Vaa	If you love softball you should stay on the team with your friend and  fun with her. Even if your not on the better team, that doesn't mean you can't have fun still. If you really want to quit you could tell your coach you need more time to focus on studies and I'm sure she would understand. Your parents will support you no matter what you decide I'm sure

dasYoU6laa	I am a 16 year old girl and I have been skating for 4 years now don't listen to the people who have just answered if I needed help and i kept falling down I would love help from anyone just make sure that they are not just playing around and the actaully know what they are doing because then they will laugh at you and make sure you just be careful when you help her up because its very easy to fall over and you don't want to do that this is the safest way I know is to put your toe pick in the ice and stable your self before you help and bend down real slowly  and if they see you skating and ask how to do that just show them real carefully and here's if there not real good ask if its ok to hold them up when there trying it say it like this do you want me to be right behind you just to be safe hope this help's if you have anymore questions here is my email <br>  <br>  catdog1993forever@yahoo.com|`|AjqO1aJgaa	"Kinda good" skaters are about five years of weekly practice beyond thinking about learning how to go backwards, I'm afraid :)<br>  <br>  My advice?

I hate that war eagle hey sh*t.  Auburn sucks.  I went to an Auburn game against Arkansas this past season and it was the most lackluster game Ive ever seen and Ive gone to every PURDUE home game for the past 4 years.  Thats how bad Auburn is.  How do you win a game 3-2 in college football?  The Red Wings average more than 3 goals a game.  And what's with the short shorts, comb overs, penny loafers, tucked in polos and sun glasses with that gay athletic band wrapped around your eccentric deep southern domes?  Weird people down there.  Nice, but weird.  Plus I wore my bright red Detroit Red Wings shirt down there and needless to say I received many unpleasant looks.  Do they really think the Civil War is at half time?<br>  <br>  EDIT - Maybe I took it too far?  Id just prefer not to see anything SEC in the hockey section.

uXJEisNlaa	Typically, women's hockey focuses on finesse and skill while men's hockey focuses on aggressiveness and strength. Because of this, women are more agile, more skilled, and much better players when it comes down to the basics. The reason there is no checking is because women's hockey has been designed to focus on skill and play-making. I don't believe it is because the pressure would be too great. Women's hockey is just so much different from men's hockey.|`|WnQ3fhVhaa	Very old IIHF rule. It was put in when the first women started to play in a long bygone era that was when people thought women were unable to handle any real physical activity. Some of women that play have been signing petitions that are going around to have that old rule tossed and let us women and girls play a checking game. But they are very slow to move on any rule changes at all.|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	It's per the IIHF.

BB6HGbnPaa	To be honest, 5:20 in a 800m is terrible. You are basically running 2:40 for a 400m while it should be around 1:00-1:30 at your age. But the 5k time is incredible. For a 14 year old, your 5k is impressive.|`|rW7fiXtdaa	ok if u ran that 800 time for your 5k run then something is definitely off caz u would not get a 19 minute 5k<br>  i think u got ur times screwed up caz an average 800 time is like 3 minutes|`|fOMcLCCcaa	You're 800m isn't the greatest.

c12ff2f01aee1d7228df9c10d0d77908aa	You did the right thing.  London-Brighton is a road run.  You therefore want to lower your rolling resistance.<br>   <br>  As suggested, lightening your bike may help.  However, the lighter something is, the more expensive it becomes.  It may be cheeper to buy a new bike.  E.G.  Easton Monkey Light carbon bars = ￡100, Seat post ￡90.  Hollowtec XT chainset ￡300.<br>  <br>  There are a few things that you can do.  Firstly, pump up your tyre pressure to at least 45psi.  This will make cycling on the road easier.  If your road tyres run at roadie pressures, go for 110 psi  (Read the side of the tyre).<br>  <br>  Lower your handle bars.  This will push your centre of gravity forward, helping you with the hills and therefore making you faster.<br>   <br>  Lose weight.  Many riders will happily spend a couple of grand getting their bike under a certain weight, but carry extra weight themselves.  Get lean and, not only will you be better, you will be faster.<br>  <br>  Keep fueled.  You have about two hours worth of energy in your legs.  Another 1/2 hour in your liver.  You need to replace this as you ride.  So get a good sized cammelback at least 2l and fill it up with a decent isotonic sports drink.  I like SIS Go, but have a look for what works for you.  Next fuel up with cerial in the morning and carbs the night before (Pasta).  Eat energy bars during the run, as well as popping jelly babies in order to get you up hills.  Again, it is worth looking at an energy gell periodically.<br>  <br>  People like mountain bikers tend to peddle hard.  Roadies on the other hand tend to drop a gear and peddle faster.  This, although seeming more frantic, will save your legs and it is a more energy efficient method for road work.<br>  <br>  Luck|`|Jr5YZ8Qbaa	Sounds like your bike is a Saracen. Without seeing the bike the usual suggestions are get the tyres right (which you've done), pump them up to the right psi as shown on the sidewalls, set your saddle at the right height, clean and lube the chain. I don't know what a speed chain is but suspect it would make very little difference. Clipless pedals like Shimano M520 with shoes like DHB M1 will help ensure your legwork all shifts the bike forward.|`|yIYEmkZyaa	pedal harder|`|MTF0Rz90aa	There are a few thing you could do but the main thing to do is get as much weight of the bike as possible. If the bike has heavy wheels front and rear try to change them for off road wheels.<br>  Again if its an old bike and has drum brakes on the rear try to replace them with discs.<br>  If you are not going to carry a passenger, cut the rear sub frame for the seat of and convert the seat to a single seat.<br>  You can do the usual with the exhaust, try a tuned pipe etc, remove the standard are filter box and replace the filter with a K&N free flow filter. <br>  Ja.|`|lt24wltEaa	Sad to say that as in any other sports, skills count a lot. Cycling is not an exemption. You can not be a good sportsman overnight. It takes a lot of patience, training and hardwork. Man, concentrate on training! This may take years but definitely YOU will acquire skills on how to pedal faster, not your bike. Visit Internet websites about cycling wherein you can learn not only cycling techniques but bike repair and maintenance as well. Good luck.|`|ai6ZGa21aa	as you have already done the tyres the best mod you could do to your bike is to alter the ratio of the gears. you could change the rear cassette of freewheel but will only make a minor difference. if it was me i would replace the crank with a racer crank. you could have a 48tooth ring on there compared to the 44tooth mtb ring.<br>  apart from that give it a good service.|`|xxq5JAM6aa	Jason thinks you're on a motorcycle and William thinks you're on a bicycle.

A $400 gun will last MUCH longer than a $150 gun, because the internals are of much high quality, so you don't have to buy as many repairs in the long run.

Once you are in your regions national squad, you are more likely to qualify for the British Gymnastics championships. The amount of training your child does, and the difficulty of the elements will also verify the level of competition he is at.

It's kind of old-school but you have great control over the ball which is what you need when you're starting out.

OrG2fBbKaa	Take a series of lessons at the area of your choice.  Some areas offer a 3 lesson package that includes a group lesson of beginners, lift tickets and equipment rental that is designed to bring never skied before people into the sport. This applies to some who have been gone for several years and includes snowboarding. For most adults in reasonable condition the learning curve will have you riding the beginning chair lift within about 4 hours of lesson time.  I am in the PNW and the majority of my day 1 ski students are riding the chair in about 1 hour and can turn both ways and stop under control on the green runs.  This package is less than $200 at our location. Prices may vary but not by a great deal.  it is typically  a day 1 of 2-4 hours and 2&3 of 2 hours each.  The days need not be consecutive.  Ask about these lessons at the resort of your choice.    I drive about 1.5 hours each way to my area 5 days a week and it is the closest of 5 within a long days drive.   Come to Seattle and learn to ski or board.  Have fun.  Make some new friends. Enjoy our sport.|`|qyATAaeXaa	The cheapest way to learn properly is to make buddies with an instructor who will teach you on his/her own time. Trying to learn from someone who does not have the right training to teach someone properly usually ends poorly...on various levels. (I see this daily.)<br>  <br>  Failing that, enroll in a lesson. Group lessons are less expensive and with the right instructor can be just as informative as a private lesson, depending on how fast a learner you are. <br>  <br>  A private lesson is usually the best option. While more expensive, the instructor can give you more attention and address specific things you need to work on. Since you have skied before, this would actually be the best option. <br>  <br>  Buying a bundle of lessons is normally a good option if they are available, but not all ski areas offer this plan.|`|6XbQXRbRaa	most resorts have Private lessons about 70-80$ including rentals and a 1 hr lesson(+). Anyway 8year old are in group lessons. so dont have a fear :D|`|IMwLQG1haa	if you dont want an instructor you could ask someone who knows how to ski and they could teach you it is usually a lot cheaper|`|Ir7JA6IUaa	Don't know where you are skiing, but where I go in PA, there are way more adults in the beginner classes than kids.  As a rule, kids are in a different group than adults, so there is no way you'd be in lesson with them.  The point of classes is to teach you the skills you need, and at an appropriate level.  You won't get put into a class that is more advanced than you are ready for, plus the instructors are taught to teach what the student is ready for, not more advanced stuff. So, don't worry about slowing down the other people in your class, as they are most likely newbies too.  <br>  <br>  Give yourself some credit; you are still young, and should learn quickly.  I just started last month, have gone four times, am now at the top end of level four, and I'm 38 and never skied at all before.  You typically learn level one and two the first time out, and then advance from there, but it depends on the resort and the student.  <br>  <br>  Also, taking classes is extremely important; you really should not try to teach yourself to ski or snowboard as you will learn bad habits and miss out on essential stuff.  <br>  <br>  So, go take a class, then ski on your own, take another class, learn more, ski more, and have fun.|`|e302JIjYaa	It would help to answer this question if I knew where you lived and what type of area you are planning to ski at. Lessons are definitely the best way for an adult to learn to ski. There are usually separate classes for adults. You can do private or group. Group lessons are cheaper and skiers are grouped by ability. I would recommend starting with a group lesson then practicing. If you are uncomfortable in the group, try a 2 hour private lesson. The very best way to learn to ski as an adult is to go out west and ski somewhere for a week - i.e. Vail, Snowmass, Steamboat, Park City - where there are lots of good runs for beginners to learn and practice on, and excellent instruction. But if you are learning at a smaller area in the east or midwest, go for a long weekend and take a lesson every day for at least part of the day.|`|vMwYT5M0aa	there are usually adult classes for beginners, but if there aren't, I would suggest making friends with an instructor|`|AA12168560	Don't go for the "do it yourself" approach. You will not enjoy the experience, and will not learn proper technique. In other words, you won't know what you are doing, and will never advance past the beginner stage. You absolutely need professional instruction. This does NOT mean asking a complete stranger who happens to know how to ski. Just because someone knows how to ski, doesn't qualify them to teach.<br>  <br>  Go with the group lessons. I used to be a ski instructor, and there were always plenty of adults signed up in group lessons. This option is cheaper than private lessons. No ski area will put an adult in with a kids lesson. And no ski area will but you in a lesson with others at a different level than you.<br>  <br>  Just ask for a Beginners Special. Many areas offer such a deal, which would include rentals, ticket, and lesson.

rZmiyAqJaa	I think it was simply a matter of the Celtics taking them too lightly.        They had such and easy run in the regular season that as Doc said ' we played like we thought we just had to show up" And as Garnett said afterwards  about going to Atlanta ' we knew they was going to have a crowd, but we didn't know they was going to have a CROWD!" Hey the biggest thing about them last year is they weren't tested, hadn't been together long enough, etc....and now they are. <br>    I have to agree with something else Doc said after the playoffs were over " the struggles with Atlanta were the best thing that happened to us during the playoffs." it showed them they have to show up and play and not take the winning for granted. <br>    The hawks are a good, young team. They have alot of athletes. They have potential, but they are not in the Celtics leauge. I think if they played that series again today, it wouldn't be nearly as close. And I don't think the C's will take anybody for granted this year.|`|FUoKu13Daa	I think some of it is that the Hawks especially last year is a very athletic team and that can spell trouble for certain teams,  <br>  <br>  And second I do not think the Celtics were worried about them,  I think they had their eyes set at the finals or maybe the Eastern Conference finals against the Piston but I am sure they  did not put much stock on the Hawks,<br>  <br>  And you made a point that maybe the Hawks were peaking at that time that they played the Celtics,<br>  <br>  But It also might come down to match ups, certain teams have trouble against certain teams because of match up, and maybe Celtics struggle last year because of the match up problem.|`|nz220kO4aa	No...if that it was a fluke then why they hell were they losing like that in boston??...  the fact is hawks OUTPLAYED them in their house...you can just see the score...the Celtics didnt layed the egg none of the games in Atalanta...Almost all of the games there were determined in the last min of the game.... so no i dont think hawks run against the celtics was a fluke.|`|wDdwYqazaa	No Celtic just arent a good away team in playoffs just look at their away record last year|`|AA11461490	No because any team on a given can beat any team... the hawks took the Celtics to 7 games cause they had some good games...

rseD4OG2aa	I have no doubt that Mr. Kennedy will become a main event star one day. You're right that whenever something good comes his way misfortune seems to strike. But when you think about it, that's all it is, misfortune. It's not a negative reflection on him, or at least it shouldn't be.<br>  Kennedy has all the tools to succeed in WWE and become a household name. Like you said, he's fantastic in the ring, and he's better then just about anyone, and I really mean that, in terms of speaking skills on the mic. He's right up there with guys like John Cena, Chris Jericho, Triple H and MVP when it comes to being a great talker. <br>  What I worry about is that the fans will start to forget about Kennedy. He's been away for so long now, and wrestling is such a 'NOW' business that I hope people will still take to him when he comes back for good. <br>  One thing I will say is that while Kennedy has definitely gone through his fair share of trials and tribulations, you can't hold down talent for long. When you have a guy that is clearly as gifted as he is, eventually he'll become a star. I don't doubt that for a second. <br>  <br>  I think that you're right as well about placing him on ECW. I wouldn't want him to get buried, but it would be a good situation for all involved if they pulled it off and booked it right. Kennedy could have a wicked program with Christian and he's the right type of guy to get the best out of someone like Jack Swagger. <br>  Both Smackdown and RAW are so filled up and clogged with main event level guys right now, there really isn't a spot available for Kennedy. I mean, on Smackdown you have Triple H (at least for now), Edge, John Cena, The Big Show, Matt and Jeff Hardy and The Undertaker with MVP clearly getting a monster face push.<br>  RAW is equally filled up with John Cena, Edge, The Big Show, Shawn Michaels, Chris Jericho and the Legends and CM Punk (even though he's been filing up the mid-card lately), plus the big storyline they have between Triple H and Randy Orton with Legacy. It just seems like Kennedy is getting squeezed out.<br>  That wouldn't happen on ECW. He'd have room to operate without the fear of getting pushed out of the spotlight and he'd have plenty of mic time and would be able to work a match lasting longer than five or six minutes. I'd like to see Kennedy work on ECW and get pushed as their franchise player for about a year before moving him back to either RAW or Smackdown.|`|16JetWj3aa	ECW isn't a bad idea. Kennedy is a decent worker who is good on the mike. In fact, if you ever listen to the only current WWE "shoot" interviews which are held in the UK by "The Sun" you will hear several top guys answer Kennedy when asked "Who's coming up?" or "Who deserves a push?" Batista is really high on Kennedy, and if both of them can stay healthy there might be something to that.|`|4THkC6Pgaa	even though he has been in the wwe longer than we think, his career has only just begun, he's young and will be a main eventer in a couple of years, he's such a talented wrestler|`|5Rbua5Wbaa	ECW is not a good push for him, they should use him more on Raw. .|`|oWJU0ky4aa	Hes great of coarse he will no doubt.|`|qwdh7N6saa	MR Kennedy should stay on RAW. thats where he belong.|`|yl86ZQ6Daa	I don't think much of Mr Kennedy!|`|a4cW6t50aa	I think Kennedy rose so far so fast that eventually he couldn't keep up with his own success. Lack of a well defined character, injuries, and not particularly impressive backstage skills have plagued the self announcing superstar from the start.<br>  <br>  Just when he seems to get some momentum BAM! Something hits him or WWE gets cold feet on his push. I think Kennedy needs to get down to the basics and go somewhere where he can re-establish himself; ECW.<br>  <br>  Being a big fish in a small pond would be just what Mr. Kennedy needs. He's got the ring skills, he's most definitely got the mic skills, but Mr. Kennedy needs to be somewhere where he can stand out, gather a hardcore following, and be under the radar enough that WWE feels comfortable adding more dimensions to his character and pushing him to the moon.<br>  <br>  Plus, a smaller stage means that Kennedy might not feel the anxiety and stress that could be contributing to his frequent injuries.<br>  <br>  Put him on ECW for a few months and let him work from the bottom. He'll be ready for the top one day. And that day might be sooner than we think.<br>  <br>  Do you agree with my thoughts and would ECW be the right place for Mr. Kennedy? Most Detailed gets Best Answer. Thanks!<br>  <br>  Star If You Like.|`|8jViRw5qaa	I think him and Cristian could form a Tag Team together and beat Miz and Morrison for the titles. Now that I think about it, it would be a great place for him. He is a high-flyer. It would be a great feud with him and Jack Swagger. I think he should get drafted to ECW in the 2009 wwe draft. He is just like a Matt Hardy. Both are United States champioonship material. When Matt got drafted to ECW he won the belt and then came back on SD, and he would have been a great fit for the World title elimination Chamber. Same thing could happen here with Mr. Kennedy. Maybe he could start winning the MITB and then get drafted to ECW and start feuding with Jack Swagger. Him and Cristian have a tag match with Mr. Kennedy, Cristian vs. Jack and Mark Henry. Then they discover they are a great tag team. They battle Miz n' Morrison and win in a non-title match. Then the next week they win the tag team titles. I think it would be great. He comes back to SD maybe to help Cristian with Edge in like 6 months at SummerSlam and wins the World Heavyweight Title (edge's 9th reign). Thanks before this I didn't even think about it.|`|E7TkNO00aa	Yeah, he has alot of talent. He should go to Raw.|`|6E16tR6xaa	Sounds great! Seems it's about the only thing he can do to make him into main event status. You should be a writer!|`|B9h6VhQOaa	the WWE did try and have him be a main eventer but he got injured which sucked. he has great mic skills and i think would make a great champion. going to ecw would be a good idea but it might get boring after a while. if  they have him win the MITB it would be awesome. he could be a surprise guest or something. then he could cash it in and that would be great. have him draft to raw cuz i think he was better there. he was kinda boring on SD!|`|IMu3wBu8aa	I completely agree. Very well said. I think that he should go to ECW to restart his career (so-to-speak). I love this idea for many reasons.<br>  1.) He will be with Christian ;)<br>  2.) It will help his career BIG TIME!<br>  3.) It will help ECW. <br>  If he goes back to Raw or Smackdown, he will get lost in the shuffle. He's talented enough to stand above the others and stick out like a sore thumb, but he does need to re-establish himself. I've read a lot of people saying things like "he's never around" "who is he" "he doesn't wrestle...ever" As crazy as this may sound, a lot of people don't even know him. They don't realize he has been here for years and has already made a name for himself. He's been away so long this time around that people have forgotten about him. I don't know how anyone could forget, but apparently it has happened. Going to ECW will help him in similar ways that it's helping Christian. Christian has been away for so long that most people don't even know him. He has already gained a lot of fans in just a few weeks. Kennedy WILL do the same thing. Kennedy is beyond talented and it will not take him long to get over with the fans again. Same goes for Christian. It will only take a few months before Kennedy is main eventing on Raw or Smackdown. I feel like it's finally his time. I think he will leave the past behind him and take over the WWE. I've been waiting for this for a long time now. So has he. He will try everything in his power to complete his well deserved push. Get ready world, Mr. Kennedy (The Champ) is about to arrive. =)|`|smcDn76jaa	Smart. Everyone is probably going to think sending him to ECW would be bad. Well look at ECW did for Matt Hardy. Hardy was getting stale on Smackdown. Months on ECW rose the ratings and rose up Matt's popularity. It also proved he could carry a brand, showing that one day he could be champ. Kennedy being on ECW works both ways. He can bring up the ratings, and while he's there he have some great feuds with, Finlay, Swagger, Dreamer, Morrison, Burchil, and Dreamer. Plus with the whole ECW/RAW/Smackdwon trade thing that opens up even more possible feuds, and championships he can have. Also like you said on ECW he can shine unlike on Smackdown or RAW where there are others to block his path to success.

P93I8CHtaa	awful performance by clevland,didnt expect it<br>  <br>  BQ:cavs,lets hope they stop wade|`|FUoKu13Daa	I did not see the game but I think the Cavs get kinda complacent sometimes,<br>  <br>  I think they feel that their defense can be turn on anytime and they can come back into games and beat good teams,  <br>  <br>  I think they need to focus on closing out this season and realize they can have homecourt advantage in the playoff is they play real well,<br>  <br>  I just think they beat certain teams with ease and certain games their starters do not play the 4th quarter and I think it makes them somewhat complacent.|`|N8AJnAbuaa	Well Good D wins game<br>  Boston played good D to stop LeBron<br>  <br>  Today i think Miami will win because of how Wade has been  playing lately hes been unstopable|`|l0iCqzlQaa	Cleveland, if it was in Miami i would of picked Miami.|`|Hvhynlftaa	Celtics played some great Defense yesterday. And Lebron settled for jump shots.<br>  <br>  Today Ill say the Heat cuz D - Wade is pretty much unstoppable, and unguardable, right now. Since Allstar break I think Wade has been averaging 35+ points and like 8+ assists and 5+ rebounds.|`|njlBV9Enaa	Yeah I agree with you. the cavs would've done much better with all the points in the paint. <br>  Miami is a really good team it'll be tough for both teams. Two great players. LBJ and Wade. i guess we'll have to wait and see.|`|jj4ZbtrCaa	They got destroyed inside by the scrubs of Boston, which is a joke, no one really drove to the hoop, and Mo was the only one that showed up.|`|wXxJUnLJaa	They didn't come to play at all. They took out the starters and subbed in the bench with 1:26 left to play and the lead was only 9. They gave up too early.|`|vfmABicvaa	Well, Boston's defense is really tight...You can't beat it indvidually...|`|L8bUjthkaa	Next time, cavs are gonna win. Dont worry!<br>  <br>  Yes, d wade is unstoppable right now.|`|C4mzZwiWaa	cavs win tonight.|`|yO4vhNM9aa	lebron didnt try last night|`|898b01bd6188d58ebfb3389cbd89aabdaa	It wasn't that the Cavs weren't trying; you could tell, especially on the defensive end that they were trying to keep the C's out of the paint but the Celtics' passing game was excellent and all of their shots were falling. If you watched closely, the Celtics were not allowing Lebron near the paint the entire game; he was pretty helpless he had to resort to long jump shots which is not his forte. I think the Cavs' lack of having a big man like Ben was huge; I would say the same for the C's but there have been several bench players to step up like Powe.<br>  I'll take Cleveland; they certainly have more depth, but I'm gonna say that Wade outplays Lebron.|`|KhCzaRQQaa	Cleveland..Cavs are playing bad defensive teams and LJ will Ice down the Heat!|`|uxregJ0faa	Boston had good D and Lebron got shutdown (again) when his driving lane was cut off. Which is why he settled for jumpshots.<br>  <br>  <br>  Cavs cant beat good teams over 500.|`|FEViNlQMaa	Probably they are reserving their energy for the next game and the Cavs know that they do not need to be serious yesterday because they will meet again in the playoffs and that is more important.<br>  <br>  I would say Heat and probably Wade will score in thirties
h5lOMoqBaa	RVD is not really considered a wrestling legend, at least in the same sense as guys like Flair and Piper are. But with that said, nobody from the old ECW are in there except for maybe Terry Funk|`|26fb51ead612e7006829de7144c65343aa	1. no they are not stupid because they make the game that your playing, because if it wasnt for them there wouldnt be a Smackdown VS.

So The Legends Idea Will Be Inputted Into 'Legends Of Wrestlemania'  <br>  <br>  And RVD Is Good Enough To Be A Legends, But In My Opinion He Needs 2 Or 3 More Years Atleast To Be Considered A Proper Legend
4c479c9c27bebd404d7ba657763fe54faa	Starrcade: The Essential Collection DVD. One of the best DVDs to get, fantastic matches from the past, how can you refuse to the chance to see the iconic Steel Cage I Quit match, Sting vs. Muta, Battlebowl, Rock ‘n Roll Express vs. The Midnight Express (which was 2 days after I was born on November 24th, 1987) and The Brisco Brothers vs. Jay Youngblood / Ricky Steamboat. Such great wrestling matches on this DVD, you have to be amazed at the quality of wrestlers on this DVD. Starrcade DVD is a must-have for any wrestling fan|`|I1w0HfQbaa	The Greatest Wrestling Stars of the 80's DVD and the Brian Pillman: Loose Cannon DVD are my choices but if I have to choose just one it would have to be the Brian Pillman DVD.

The Stars of the 80s features the Kerry Von Erich-Jerry Lawler match and the Chi Town Rumber match between Ric Flair and Ricky "the Dragon" Steamboat and that was a great match. But if forced to choose just one it would be the Brian Pillman DVD.

XRw2ux9waa	I agree. I went to No Way Out, and across the arena from my side there were noticeably a lot of empty seats. I guess this is normal considering WWE never films anything on that side of the arena. <br>  <br>  I don't know if the new generation fans are the ones to blame, but the crowds are dead. Well, not dead, but definitely not as alive and into the matches as they used to be. At No Way Out I shouted at the top of my lungs throughout the whole show, and how I felt. And then most of the fans around me we're pretty dead. Except for a few others. But that was just my area. I don't know about the others.<br>  <br>  I also agree on the HD Screens. When they first debuted I thought it was possibly a cool idea. But now being used to it, it seems to high tech for WWE, It doesn't have the same attitude that the others showed.<br>  <br>  Also, the different screens on each brand made the show unique, Smackdown had the fist, and it stood out. RAW had that odd huge screen that screamed attitude in my opinion. Now all the screens are the same, and the only thing that sets them apart are their colors. <br>  <br>  A bit boring.|`|8jK33jK1aa	I believe it is the unemployment rate and the failing economy more than anything else.

Not me tho, I love It soooooooo much!...|`|qqLcvDDKaa	I guess they've lost alot of fans since then.|`|4t709Ws7aa	It's because most of the wrestling fans are starting to lose interest in the WWE.

Today the company to me seems more about selling merchandise than entertaining the fans.|`|V2EAMLelaa	Yeah people has lost the emotion , like you said, to WWE. When i watch WWE nowadays you see the people in the crowd just chillin in their cellphones or busy talking to each other, like if they were in some kind of party...|`|nKSmgjylaa	I know what you mean. Sometimes I feel that fans at the "Hulk Hogan's Celebrity Championship Wrestling" arens are more into the matches than WWE or TNA fans are. I remeber the "You Suck!" chants in time with Angles music. Now the best they can come up with is "Booo!" and "Cena, Cena, Cena, Cena!".|`|PrpLmZoRaa	i agree...since the WWE has gone PG it started to suck...and the HD screens....God, they're ugly...the old sets were a lot better

There is Carizzo, Ustari, Romero already playing in Europe and they r all younger than him. He might get left on the bench and not play. I also doubt Atlante will sell him.
NxKjrz7xaa	lol he will be on the suckiest team in the nba, bad thing about football is major injuries and way less $$ i choose basketball, get endorsements, shoe contracts, powerade and gatorade contracts, icy hot commercials, haha nba beats the nfl|`|kYBlgFQAaa	He'll most likely be in the NBA next year, but maybe he can play in the NFL if he has some spare time.  The Cowboys might be looking for a wideout now that they cut TO.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Professional athletes can't compete in collegiate sports, so you might have to convince him to stay in school.  It's too bad.  If he was drafted by the Thunder, it would be an easy commute to OU.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:  To Infinite Baller:  Obviously you are the one that wasn't smart enough to recognize my answer was written tongue in cheek.  I was bored so I answered his question.   To be crystal clear, no, I don't think Blake Griffin could play in the NFL or even college.  Relax dude, and don't take everything you read on the internet so seriously.  I don't need to ask if you are dumb or just plain stupid.  I already know the answer.|`|IiWz11Kraa	Next year, he'll be in one of the suckiest teams in the NBA.|`|GvVoL70aaa	I know I am going to get a lot of  thumbs down for this but W/E,<br>  <br>  Are you dumb or just plain stupid? Why would he play football when he is one of the top players in NCAA right now, when he is almost guaranteed a spot on a Nba Team ,with a rookie salary? I mean come on...... think a little or do not regurgitate what you hear in the local pub from a aloof type of guy...<br>  <br>  Also Corey the same applies to you.... Are you dumb or just plain stupid... just because he is good in basketball that does not mean he is good in every other sport.... it is funny how you thought ahead of the question and started to speculate if the cowboys will sign him or not...... THEY NEED A FOOTBALL PLAYER NOT A GOOD BASKETBALL PLAYER<br>  <br>  Lol <br>  <br>  You have just read the first addition of are you dumb or just plain stupid... watch for the next...|`|yO4vhNM9aa	he should play rugby|`|C4mzZwiWaa	y is this in basketball section?|`|uH7mv5Euaa	No. The basketball team wouldn't let him and he is not a fast runner or anything he is just tall and jumps high.

The media and me talking about him all the time makes him seem overrated. Before when I asked about Kun I had people going "Who?" So if he got where he is it's not because he was/is overrated.

xxq5JAM6aa	The computer divides the distance traveled by the time it takes and calculates the average speed. It's your stops that make the big difference.|`|Txg9giQfaa	Like Cyclebum says, the starts and stops are the killer.  It would be physically impossible to go from 0 to 19 instantly on a bicycle; same with 19 to 0, although that would be a little quicker.  It's just those time periods when you aren't up to cruising speed that drag down the average.|`|c2b4f2c9fe643129d284d8728194ae6aaa	well<br>  <br>  the starts and stops reduce the average<br>  <br>  there could be something else going on though<br>  <br>  sometimes computers can be set to run all the time<br>  that is, when you are completely stopped, the average is still dropping<br>  <br>  make sure it isn;t in that mode<br>  <br>  usually though they don;t compute averages if you are going under 2 or 3 mph - that won;t be included<br>  <br>  wle.|`|Z5xgSATSaa	During the time that you slow down for a light, and the time you speed up back to your normal riding speed you are going slower. This really affects your overall average speed as calculated by your computer. every time you ride below your average speed, it drops. It is normal that in city riding your average speed is about 5 mph slower than the speed you ride at.

AA12243350	It looks like the military is not going to go with the 6.8 (which was a dumb idea to begin with, but don't get me started there) so, as a commercial load, it will probably be around, but on a par with other ammo.<br>  .223 is scarce for two reasons, first, the military is burning thru millions and millions of rounds and the manufacturers are running 24/7 just trying to keep up with that commitment. And even if the fighting stopped today, it would be mopnths and months before they filled the restocking needs for the military. So commercial needs take second place.<br>  Second, with the election of the most anti gun administration EVER, and their commitment to banning firearms, ammo thru every tactic you can think of, people are in full panic mode qand sucked up what little ammo they could find, shortage causes demand, demand causes high prices. Will it ever be more available or cost less? only if the manufacturers have time to fill the back orders and most importantly, if the gun grabbers don't pass the bills they have planned. <br>  Yes, you can get free float forearms for rifles chambered in 6.8<br>  shoot safe|`|AA10418382	I've owned a 6.8 from STAG for a couple of years now and I haven't seen anything to make me believe that 6.8 components aren't going to rise as fast as 5.56. It will probably be the same for people who buy boxed rounds also.  I see everything rising in cost proportionately.  A .277 bullet costs more then a .223 because it has more lead and copper.  That will always be the case.  If anything the volume of production of .223 keeps it lower than it should be in comparision.|`|YrxLbfiIaa	6.8 take off or fizzle???? --- If the military switches all there rifles to it then sure - It will take off.... Until that happens I am sticking to .223.....<br>  <br>  .223 Getting rarer? --- I think what you really mean is its getting a little scarce..... Its not rare and is as common as the sky is blue....<br>  <br>  In my area .223 has been consistently available at decent prices... The 6.8SPC is to expensive and unless it gets adopted totally by the military, police departments, etc then I don't see the price going down.....<br>  <br>  I do realize there seems to be shortages online and in many area's of the USA.... If your having trouble getting this stuff cheap then contact friends or relatives in other states and see if they would be nice enough to check around in your area for ammo.......<br>  <br>  If you really cant find ammo then just contact me and I can get it here for you. My dealer usually has PMC brass .223 at $7.99 a box with anywhere from 20 to 100 boxes on the shelf at anytime........|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	It's not getting rarer. People are just buying more. Right now the average price of .223 is 41 cents per round. 44 cents here because of sales tax. A lot of ammo manufacturers work by contract and don't have a surplus due to thew way they sell. They only surplus is what the military contracts but batches that were for the military fail the very high specification of the military which is then sold to us civilinas as say federal XM193. But all that has been bought up.<br>  <br>  6.8 is harder to find and always will be. It's not as in demand and therefore less of it would be made.

tzrLDbHWaa	I actually think a lot of teams would take him.  As much as you may think its a crazy move, the NFL is a business where winning is the most important thing there is.  The NFL has a hard salary cap and you have to work with that to get the most talent you can for the money you have to spend.  T.O. most likely won't get the money he was making in Dallas, and therefore he'll likely be a relatively inexpensive player who has great talent.|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	I'm waiting for a report that TO is talking to the Patriots...Wouldn't be surprised if it happens...<br>  <br>  Ironically, one of the teams that has expressed interest, according to the media anyway, is the 49ers...his ORIGINAL team...<br>  <br>  Might be fun to see TO try to figuratively throw Mike Singletary under the bus...and then see Mike Singletary LITERALLY throw TO under the bus...*LOL*|`|rM9WzIkHaa	T.O is the manny of baseball. there might be one team interested, but it'll be for like 3 years 2 mil. so if he wants to play he better take it because, like i said there will probably be only one team interested.|`|7B9KEqCnaa	Look for TO to sign in Buffalo.  They need star power to attract fans.  Thats the only reason a team would sign TO.

fYIIRgVraa	I got this basketball system on Black Friday 2007 and ever since Spring 08 when i put it up, it has worked like a charm. The only draw back with it is the assembly but all systems take a good day or two to build manually. I would fill it up with sand for it to stay stationary. Lifetime Elite is a great brand to use and is durable, along with the fact that not only it is glass but there is a handle on the back of the poll to adjust +/- 5 ft. <br>  <br>  Good Luck on your future basketball system.

hEpL5MsWaa	Ok you are probably keeping your front foot pretty low, in that case I would suggest keeping your front foot up by the top bolts and flicking out as soon as you pop. When you flick make sure you flick up and out (if that makes any sense). Also make sure to flick the board quickly. Skateboarding tricks are all about commitment and learning your own personal technique and whatever works for you stick with it.|`|2lakZBgiaa	well for kickflips you just need to pop, flick out, and catch it. the problem is, your not fully commiting. you gotta flick it out and try to land with both feet. don't be afraid of not landing and falling on a flat ground kickflip. like if it was over a 20 stair i could understand. but flat ground? you just gotta fully commit and KEEP PRACTICING! it took me about a month to get my kickflips down! now, its been like 4 years, and i can almost kickflip a 12<br>  :]|`|l3HsU1vNaa	Ok, first ollie, then directly after, flick your foot as hard as you possibly can. and jump as high as possible to make it look good. the jump is the key. my friends older brother gave me some good tips. like, imagine your in a plastic bubble and if you fall out of it you die. helped me anyway. hope i helped!|`|PbhcT0LIaa	OK have you done your ollie yet..its all about balance dude practice ur ollies

He wasn't the only problem.|`|dnwJmNkdaa	s a giant fan I feared seeing TO on the field that being said he is a certifiable nutcase....   he may be bi polar...  regardless Any team should be able to deal with a crazy player if he puts up numbers like TO....  <br>  <br>  Romo is inconsistent<br>  Pacman is unreliable<br>  Marion is a ferocious back but he takes a beating witout an Oline<br>  Felix jones was njured<br>  Demarcus ware is dangerous but now canty is gone|`|M5ykrN4Laa	It's about TIME someone else knows what they are talking about...I DO think Romo and Witten had a small alliance against T.O.

Other problems lead off in to the coaching staff with Wade and don't forget the play calling, but I won't say any names.<br>  <br>  Daddy Big bucks upstairs who can't keep his hands out the honey pot either is the biggest problem. I will call him out though...Mr. Jerry Jones. Get your act together PAL!|`|cdQryr7paa	No, he wasn't the only problem, but he was one of the biggest.<br>  That's why they cut Pac Man, Tank Johnson and safety Roy Williams.<br>  Maybe Jerry Jones has learned that signing every trouble maker and criminal in the league doesn't work.<br>  That being said, he will probably disappoint the heck out of me and run out and sign Michael Vick.<br>  lol.|`|VXQFT341aa	No he wasn't the only problem. Ownership is the main problem. Jerry needs to let the coaches decide who they need. Oh wait he has a puppet as a head coach now. His yes man.|`|9vq0oSD2aa	It's obvious he wasn't the ONLY problem.

With a health line they will closer to what there were on O a couple of years ago, Step Jax will be a stud again and Bulger can be a decent QB.

Keep working up strength until you can walkover.|`|JWTYesO9aa	This is how I tore my rotator cuff.<br>  SO be carefull!<br>  But, lay on your back and push up to your hands and feet.<br>  to go down from standing make sure you have a spotter holding your back.<br>  They HAVE to be able to support your weight.<br>  HAVE FUN! :)|`|BkUdgEXWaa	Go to a wall in your house with someone that can spot you face away from the wall and bend back allowing your hand to touch the wall. Tell your spotter to place their hands a couple inches under your back as you go down in case you need to let go of the wall. Slowly start walking your hands down the wall till they touch the floor that's how i learned then you don't need the wall any more and you can master standing back up from your back bend it's the first step to learn a flip flop GOOD LUCK!!!!

FrojZ51oaa	ha i dont know what that dude up there was talking about, but anyways what i do is this<br>  1 when you are in the air i kinda grip or hit my legs so i know that i am tucking enough<br>  2 then to land you have to land with your head and hands  up, looking straight ahead and not leaning forward..  this way you wont fall forwards, if you are falling backwards, keep your hands in front and try to set it up higher. when you are jumping pretend like you are dunking a basketball, so you get higher up.<br>  3 ask a coach for tips, they probably give better ones than me.<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck|`|W4FtzyDnaa	Oh my, it's been so long since I was in gymnastics.<br>  <br>  I'm assuming you mean front flip as in front tuck, and not front handspring, which some of our coaches used to call front flip flops. :)<br>  <br>  I always found front flips a bit harder to land than back flips, but I think the key is to "set" first. I.e., before punching into the front flip, keep your head looking straight ahead (never at the ground). It forces your body to check its momentum so you get more height, and also better form in the air. Also, when punching into the front flip, try keeping your feet in front of you slightly, rather than leading with your head. <br>  <br>  Other than that it's a matter of balancing forward momentum with rotation, which just takes practice. We used to call it "air sense". <br>  <br>  If you have a friend with a video camera or even a tripod, in my gymnastics days I always found that it helps to see yourself in action, so you can figure out what you're doing wrong. Such an invaluable tool when correcting form.|`|KcL7XKevaa	ok well i am the master at this lol ok anyways my friend said to alwas tuck your legs in like hold them in the air <br>  OR<br>  you can start off on the middle of the trampoline with your hand in a fist in the air like your are rasing your hand then when u flip take your hands and pull them down to ur wast <br>  <br>  ps. tuck you legs in <br>  its easyer
cdQryr7paa	No, they weren't as bad as the Lions.<br>  The 2007 season the Cardinals went 8-8, only one game worse than they were in 2008.<br>  The difference was in 2007 the Seahawks went 10-6 and won the division and the Cards came in second.<br>  In 2008 when the Seahawks stank it up (4-12), the Cardinals 9-7 record was good enough to win the division and get into the playoffs.|`|c17x6L4baa	Before 2001 the Cards made the Lions look like champs as far as over-all records since they came to Arizona in 1988<br>  <br>  The Lions have 6 seasons of 9-7 or better since 1988.<br>  The Cards have 2 seasons of 9-7.  None better.<br>  Lions had a 12-4 and two 10-6 seasons<br>  The Lions have 6 play-off appearances.<br>  The Cards have 2 play-off apprearances <br>  <br>  Cards do have three times as many play-off victories over that time period though with 3 this year.  They do have a better record since 2001 also.|`|16561360453f1fcbaf919e880b04e02caa	Arguably worse.<br>  <br>  The Lions heyday was in the mid to late 50s.  The Cards brief heyday was in the mid 40s.|`|XaFYUMRSaa	Nobody has ever been as horrible as the Lions.................|`|KLjfQjVEaa	They have always been a below-mediocre team.  They have made the play-offs 1 time in the last 20 years or so.  This year was the 2nd.<br>  <br>  Although, the Lions have set a precedent for being the worst team every with their terrible record the past couple of years.  So I can't say they have been that bad.|`|AA10776364	Unlike the Lions, the Cards have been showing signs of being a good team for a few years now, but just was never able to put all the pieces together.  They have had exceptional talent, and Wisenhunt put it to good use.|`|fiaFQAWWaa	No, but they sometimes looked that way when Leinart was playing.|`|Cb0l4QvKaa	as bad as the lions? no<br>  <br>  bad? yes, they were a very mediocre team before this season|`|j6SUkE4Raa	cardinals still suck steelers are old news, get over it, that was then this is now|`|7RziqsDcaa	Yea, the Cardinals were always under .500 before this year, when they finally decided Kurt Warner was better than Matt Leinhart.

But Eli has potential, and I wouldn't be surprised if he had a more illustrious career than Peyton|`|tzrLDbHWaa	You really can't even compare the two.  Peyton Manning is arguably the best QB in the league, there are only a few others you can make a case for, and Eli is not one of them.<br>  <br>  Eli is a good QB, but he's not great.  Last year Eli ranked 14th in QB rating, with his highest ever rating, and its still nothing close to Peyton.  Eli throws too many INTs, and doesn't always make good decisions with the ball.  If his last name wasn't Manning, you wouldn't really think of him as much better than Trent Edwards.  The year before, although he won a Super Bowl, his stats were actually worse than Joey Harrington's and Damon Huard's.  He has potential, but for now he's an average QB on a good team with a lot of hype because he's Peyton's brother.|`|M5ykrN4Laa	It's is Peyton Manning by a MILE!

nJ5kceMBaa	1. Short, sharp passing. Don't dwell on the ball. Move it along as soon a possible, keeping it simple.<br>  <br>  2. Lots of movement. Give your teammates options and always look for space to move into. Even if you can't make enough space to receive the ball yourself, by moving around you're dragging your marker out with you and therefore creating space for a teammate to receive the ball.<br>  <br>  3. Discipline. Don't all charge forward, because you'll be wide open to a counter attack. Keep at least one man back at all times to hold play up, and make sure your team is willing to get back and defend.<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps, but it's hard to know what's going wrong for you without watching you play.|`|0w9tY32uaa	you have to always be on your toes, and always moving. NEVER STANDING IN ONE PLACE!|`|hch4DBiJaa	Stay calm at all times. You might feel ready for action and go right at 'em, but this will turn against you.<br>  - Make sure you stay defending well, make sure the defenders always stay on the inside and push the forwards outwards<br>  -Because your defenders stay back, you don't give the opposing team to counter you. Stay calm and LET THEM MAKE THE MISTAKES and exploit them.<br>  -If you screw up, let it roll off of your back. Missing by an inch is the same as missing by 5 metres. It didn't go in, and thinking/worrying/getting annoyed about it is not going to get it in either. Just let mistakes roll off of your back and try again next time.<br>  It's all in calmness

Dang i'll have to take Paul man..|`|wd7XuvKnaa	You're an idiot, how the f*ck would we know how great Durant will be.<br>  <br>  Let me add that Durant plays NO DEFENSE, Kobe plays excellent Defense. Both are great scorers, but Kobe's better at everything else.|`|33cnTn1Laa	BRYANT<br>  DUNCAN<br>  PUAL|`|GfOR2H0kaa	Durant<br>  O'Neal<br>  Nash|`|AA11488609	Kobe<br>  Tim<br>  CP3 (he's already as good as Nash in his prime with an offense that isn't as fast paced!)
FUoKu13Daa	I am going against the Grain,  Your two picks are great picks and I agree that they are two of the great  and you can't deny Wooden success at UCLA and some of those undefeated seasons.<br>  <br>  But another coach that should be considered is Larry Brown,  He specialize in turning around franchises and he is the only coach to win a NBA championship and NCAA collegiate championship as a coach. He will never get the credit because he does not have a lot of NBA championships but like I said he usually goes to teams that are in the gutter.  The Bobcat are very close to getting into the playoff and they are having their best season ever under first year coach Brown,<br>  <br>  As far as recognition then Phil Jackson will always be remember as the greatest coach but my problem with Phil being in that position is he has always had the best talent in the league when he coached.<br>  <br>  Pippen and Jordan  and later Rodman on those 6 championship team but their was no better than MJ,<br>  <br>  A young hungry and dominating Shaq and a brash talented kid in Kobe, they were two of the top players in the league and they got 3 championship with them,<br>  <br>  And now Kobe is still arguably the best player in the world and since and Gasol is still one of the better big man in the world so Jackson teams always had some of the greatest talent going around.<br>  <br>  I would like to see Jackson take a struggling franchise like the Clippers and see if they would have multiple championships then,<br>  <br>  I do believe he is probably the best in managing talent,  the one time Brown became coach of a very good team the Piston they won a championship that year so I think it is easier to manage good talent instead of developing good talent.<br>  <br>  Edit: The flip side on Brown is he has a tendency to bounce around and not stay in one place.  He reminds me of a builder that enjoys building something but does not get much out of it once it is built.|`|C4mzZwiWaa	phil jackson.|`|L8bUjthkaa	Phil jackson|`|gsMXaA3caa	phil jackson|`|NxKjrz7xaa	my boy phil jackson, boy did i love the bulls era|`|898b01bd6188d58ebfb3389cbd89aabdaa	Well it's definitely not Phil Jackson; any coach can win when they have  amazing teams thrown into their laps. I'd have to say that at the moment, it'd be Greg Popovich; Pops has the perfect temperament according to me and develops his bench players better than any other team. The reason for the Spurs' success has been their bench depth and that is directly related to coaching.|`|ks54akugaa	Come on thats easy as 123<br>  PHIL JACKSON AND RED <br>  Each have what like 9 rings i think, i give the edge to phil cause he got to caoch the greatest of all time, Thats Michael Jordan for all you newcomers.|`|014d662e9ccdcc2dfcbd68b27f469d57aa	John Wooden|`|vfmABicvaa	Phil Jackson or Mike D'Antoni are the best coaches.|`|8MmtBYlLaa	Coach K.

4c479c9c27bebd404d7ba657763fe54faa	I prefer Tevez. Yes, Berbatov is a good finisher but Tevez's workrate amazes me, he goes deep into midfield at times and supports the attack also. Tevez is a far better footballer than Berbatov|`|OYYYNCyCaa	Tevez gives 100% each game a great player at Man Utd <br>  <br>  <br>  Berbatov would do better if he gave more than 20% effort, a little bit lazy does not like doing the hard work, he expects Park Ji-Sung to do all of running for him|`|mK06dus9aa	Tevez - is it true he's going to Liverpool|`|SWkOC7rhaa	I think it's because Fergie paid a lot of cash for Berbatov so he has to use him more often. Tevez is definately a better player like he proved earlier today against Fulham. His work-rate is brilliant compared to Berbatov. I don't see why they bought him in the first place. He should go back like Keane did LOL!|`|d99GIH9Uaa	Tevez in the day games<br>  <br>  Berbatov at night [not in a sick way, just bcoz he plays well in later games lol]|`|El7C2JsMaa	Although i do prefer Tevez as a player i actually prefer how we play as a team with Berbatov, Ronaldo plays more wide with Berbatov in the team (more like he did 2 seasons ago) so this allows him to get more assists which as a winger is his main job.<br>  <br>  Also Berbatov is getting in the team for his 13 goals and something like 11 assists already, that amount of assists for a striker is pretty impressive especially for someone who is considered lazy! <br>  Berbatov's work rate has improved a lot since he joined, he does a lot more than people give him credit for on numerous occasions against Newcastle (and most other games) he could be seen tracking back and making tackles at the half way line but it always goes unnoticed and people just judge him on his reputation! People are so hung up on the fact that he doesn't run around as much as Tevez, Rooney or Park but lets not forget that those players have a much higher work rate than most players and besides Berbatov's job is to score goals not go chasing after every ball and when we have players like Rooney and Park there is no need for him to do that! I also seem to remember that Rooney gets quite a lot of criticism for tracking back in to his own half too much!|`|IWM1khX7aa	Berbatov is highly overrated and Tevez is highly underrated.  Berbatov only did good with Robbie Keane at Tottenham.  When Keane left Tottenham, notice Berbatov didn't want to play.  Tevez can play with any team (like West Ham) and does well and I don't think benching him is the answer.  I think Berbatov has the better shot accuracy but he does not play with teams real well.  I prefer Carlos Tevez.|`|pRklTpuFaa	tevez just doesnt stop working and running and he always tries his hardest..<br>  yeah  think its a bit unfair that tevez is only played when fergie's giving berba a rest<br>  but berbatov is a brill player!! great finisher!!<br>  i hope tevez doesnt move in the summer.|`|e197cb3f4211de6521dcc6f8afc0358caa	Tevez.

O3TuQZItaa	First, Dub gave you the correct basic info on this type of purchase.<br>  <br>  As has been noted, the M4 is a post 1986 design, and so there will be none on the transferable market. There is however a method to get the same basic gun. It involves the following.<br>  <br>  As you know, the M4 is an updated version of the M16. The point here is that for all practical purposes, all the changes are in the upper receiver.<br>  <br>  In the case of the AR guns, the serial number is on the lower receiver, and so that is the part that must be registered. To get your M4, you would simply cough up a big chunk of money, buy any transferable M16, and install the M4 parts.<br>  <br>  Here are some guns that are transferable and for sale:<br>  <a href="http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.asp?Item=124100079" rel="nofollow">http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewIte...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.asp?Item=124332884" rel="nofollow">http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewIte...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.asp?Item=124410315" rel="nofollow">http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewIte...</a><br>  <br>  Here are a few uppers to make the conversion:<br>  <a href="http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.asp?Item=123550430" rel="nofollow">http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewIte...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.asp?Item=124058265" rel="nofollow">http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewIte...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.asp?Item=124496451" rel="nofollow">http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewIte...</a><br>  <br>  Good job on escaping the DC nut house.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	As the first poster said, only full-auto weapons made before 1986 can be transferred to civilians.  Since the M4 wasn't on the market then, it's not going to be available to you.|`|8cWXhZGjaa	It veries across different states. In my state you can legally buy one but you just have to go through a rigorous criminal record screening process.|`|f3f63c87e27f64c3e9f1679c165409b8aa	In order to purchase a fully auto weapon in the USA you'll have to get a class 3 license.  Class 3 will require finger printing, and background checks via numerous federal agencies.  Really not worth the trouble, but I'll post more if I can find it.<br>  <br>  Dub is correct.<br>  <br>  But as a side note.  If you decide not to go forward with the automatic thing and instead decided to get a concealed handgun license, Oregon has some of the best laws in the nation on where you can carry.  Very places you cannot carry in Oregon.  Very Concealed Carry friendly state.|`|AA10517492	First a brief history: In May of 1986, certain laws went into effect that made it illegal for 'civilians' to own fully automatic firearms that were manufactured AFTER THAT DATE. Many fully automatic weapons manufactured, registered and tax paid BEFORE MAY, 1986, MAY BE OWNED BY AND SOLD TO INDIVIDUALS. The full-auto guns that may be owned by individuals are called 'transferable'. Some states DO NOT allow machine gun ownership at all, no matter when the gun was made, but many states do. <br>  <br>  To purchase a transferable machine gun, you must meet certain requirements (generally the same as when you purchase another gun, but with additional scrutiny), fill out special paperwork (called a 'form 4'), and pay a $200, one-time, transfer tax. Every time a machine gun is transferred, the $200 tax must be paid-- usually by the purchaser. The steps to take to purchase a transferable machine gun are:<br>  <br>  Find a dealer locally who can assist you in all phases of the transfer. This should go beyond helping you fill out the paperwork: they should help you locate the gun if it isn't in stock and allow you to shoot the gun while your paperwork is being processed by the BATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms). It will usually take 4-6 weeks for the dealer to get the gun from another dealer if they don't already have it in stock (due to BATF paperwork delays). <br>  Get your fingerprints (either by a police dept. or by a qualified fingerprinter, two imprints are needed) and two passport sized pictures taken. These will be used to perform a comprehensive criminal background check on you. <br>  Have your local dealer help you fill out an "Application for Tax Paid Transfer And Registration Of Firearm" for, known as a "form 4". <br>  You must have the signature of the Chief Law Enforcement (CLEO) officer that has jurisdiction over the municipality in which you live on the form 4. This could be the City Chief or the County Sheriff, for example. This is usually not a problem-- in machine gun friendly states. The form 4, CLEO signature, 2 fingerprint cards, 2 pictures, and a $200 check (your one-time transfer tax) must all be mailed to the BATF and an approved tax stamp returned before you may take possession of the gun. This may take anywhere from 2 to 5 months.<br>  This is the process to get a class 3 license.
grbicWXaaa	Because Jerry Jones realized something.<br>  <br>  The Cowboys had an amazing roster. Mariam Barber (RB) TO (WR) DeMarcus Ware (LB) not to mention a pretty good O-Line.<br>  <br>  What he realized that even though he had a pretty good roster they got murdered by the Eagles and they did make it to the Playoffs because the team didn't know how to work together. Tony Romo is a terrible team leader and took a vacation 1 week before the Eagles game instead of practicing. T.O. is a cry boy and was a Lockeroom cancer and always complained to Romo to throw the ball to him. Terrell Owens has always been a big whiner which caused him to get released by 3 teams so far even though he has amazing talent.<br>  <br>  Thats why the Steelers are amazing. Humble players (except for Harrison) amazing owner and good fan base.|`|7RziqsDcaa	T.O. is great to have on your team:<br>  <br>  He is a great receiver.<br>  He can get wins.<br>  You can put all the blame on him when you suck (like the Dallas Cowboys).|`|cdQryr7paa	Where have you been the last year and a half???<br>  T.O. is an absolute disgrace to the Cowboy uniform.<br>  Dallas fans are only in shock because they can't believe Jerry Jones finally pulled his head out and got rid of that egotistical, selfish trouble maker.<br>  He may have caught some touchdowns, but he dropped as many as he caught.<br>  The offense couldn't produce because he whined he wanted the ball every single play and Romo had to try to force it to him all the time.<br>  They were even lining him up in the backfield as well as running stupid reverses to him.<br>  It was pathetic.<br>  And then when they lose he would sit in the locker room and point fingers at everyone else and blame them for losing the game because they didn't give him the ball.<br>  He divided the locker room and was a huge distraction from playing football.<br>  He deserved to be cut just like Pac Man and Tank Johnson.<br>  Dallas fans are more relieved than they are shocked.|`|7obFZ2Gyaa	I saw  an interview on nfl.com with jerry jones and  it had strictly to do with  the salary cap and not  anything to do with  owens antics or  romo or witten at all.  The Cowboys believe Roy E Williams will be  their star  WR  and actually that was another reason too  is because  they  think he will pick up his play with  Owens GONE !!!|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	Because TO is the walking incarnation of advanced colon cancer.|`|NcXSsE9Vaa	negative publicity bad attitude and inconsistency|`|8wmjYlfaaa	is that a trick question?|`|LpR9sLSlaa	Because TO has disrupted EVERY team he's been with<br>  <br>  I can't believe it took JJ that long to wake up<br>  He has "talent" on the field, but he does drop a LOT of balls<br>  And he is pure destruction in the Locker room...<br>  <br>  "By the time he forced his way out of San Francisco, he already had turned on quarterback Jeff Garcia privately – an ugliness Owens eventually made known in a variety of ways, including an interview with Playboy Magazine in which he questioned Garcia’s sexuality. Philadelphia was supposed to be the fresh start, complete with a big-armed quarterback and a great supporting cast. But it only took one year for Owens to start a raging forest fire in the Eagles locker room, undermining quarterback Donovan McNabb, disrespecting then-offensive coordinator Brad Childress and even coming to blows with former teammate Hugh Douglas."<br>  <br>  "Media reports out of Dallas over the course of last season read like an unchanging manual of self-destruction, complete with Owens allegedly showing an uncanny ability for chirping and bitching and stirring up other teammates.<br>  <br>  A former Cowboys coach told Yahoo! Sports last month that he saw Owens do it with fellow wideouts Miles Austin and Patrick Crayton. Other media reports indicated Owens did the same with newly acquired wideout Roy Williams, too, all the while creating a familiar divide between his recruits and some of the familiar targets: the quarterback, the head coach, the wide receivers coach, the offensive coordinator and others. Like his situations in San Francisco and Philadelphia, it wasn’t just Owens having his own problems. It was T.O. convincing other players they should have a problem, too."<br>  <br>  I think that in the near future, even more players will come out with the truth about him, now that they don't have to worry about him in the locker anymore.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news;_ylt=Ao...">http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news;_ylt=Ao...</a>|`|EVc90HV0aa	Hold on, the NFL's number one receiver? No, he is good, but his mouth is what makes the Cowboys look bad. The best receiver in the NFL is Andre Johnson, and second is Fitzgerald from Arizona. So TO isn't that good. His mouth is so confident that everytime they fail (always in the playoffs) TO and Romo look stupid because they talk like they're the best, but they suck. The next one leave is Romo.|`|BlgZmV6uaa	Jerry jones is a top rate GM.He knows Talent when he sees it.I am sure he has a backup plan.He is either going to have someone in the draft or he has a free agent signed that he hasn't clued us in on yet.Don't worry!|`|acaAycEXaa	Because T.O. drop ball.<br>  <br>  Jason Witten is the star receiver on the Cowboys!<br>  <br>  If you don't know by now why no one wants T.O., no one can explain it to you.|`|W2R8TRDmaa	Every cowboy fan I've talked to is thrilled and relieved.  He is a cancer and they believe they're a better team without him.  I agree.|`|7cyqgJQnaa	Jerry Jones needed a scapegoat. but he isnt gonna last long anyway is already 35|`|Jp7qZKfMaa	He was to heavy|`|vJ20fTZWaa	are u crazy??!! he crys in interveiws, and then he actually thinks the tight end and QB are planing things behind his back|`|3ieIGYMaaa	well i think that he was not too much of a distraction in dallas as he was in san fran and philly. a star reciver, high production, somtimes dropped balls (who doesn't). really i don't see the reason why the cowboys released him. maybe him and romo had a secret fight or somthing like that

AA10241450	Hi Tori - sounds like you have a splendid environment to train.  If your just running to stay fit since it seems like your course has hills and tough terrain keep training the way your doing it.  If anything try to add 15 minutes to take in the scenery and enjoy your time abroad. Our cross country our warm up everyday was running to the course which was a few miles from the school so really you don't need to train long and then short the next day.  If anything add fartleks since you ran XC or sprint 50 meters when you feel like it every mile or 8 minutes and go back into your jog.    <br>  <br>  If available try running some road races and running with the locals.  Good luck!|`|rW7fiXtdaa	try running fast and hard up the hills then run down slow to catch ur breath <br>  u can also try running some intervals maybe 6x1000's or mile repeats...but if u are looking for just a leisure run than maybe just increase ur running speed and run for a longer period of time|`|jtvrSod4aa	well you can use the hills and dirt for training you can focus more on flexibility,conditioning and strength dept work out and use proper breathing techniques that will help to reduce lactic acid build up.

Not only will the manufactures not make it ie. (Nike and Reebok) but by team rights and NBA licensing agreement you cannot custom make a jersey with a player already on a different team having the same last name and number on the jersey. So unless you want to have the back of your jersey say something different that "James, 23" ..then you wont be able to find a LeBron Knicks Jersey.|`|yO4vhNM9aa	take a knicks jersey that says 23, and draw "james" on the back, you willl never get a real one  CAUSE BRON IS STAYIN WITH CLEVELAND|`|zaZibcGkaa	get it custom made at any NBA jersey site, b/c he is never leaving Cleveland|`|IiWz11Kraa	Probably next year, or probably not at all.|`|qq1fSV2daa	considering he'll never be wearing one ... i wouldn't hold your breath

Ar9XHVaeaa	In the long run, the best thing to do would be to work on your foot speed. That is the obvious thing that needs to be done to run an effective 800. in practice, work on doing 200 and 400 m repeats. with proper rest in between, you can probably run the 200's at race pace, with the 400's a little slower. As you get better and your times improve, obviously adjust your speed and time. <br>  <br>  As far as strategy goes, here's my suggestion. Make sure that you are controlled in the first lap. The flow of the race should cause you to go out at a good speed. Don't over exert yourself, you do not need to lead the entire race. On the second lap, it takes a little bit more work. I like to do a little surge with somewhere between 250-350 meters to go. everyone else is gearing up for a finishing kick or tired from the first lap, it is a good spot to make a move. <br>  <br>  Speaking of the finishing kick, obviously just run as hard as you can, be as aggressive as possible, it will be over soon and you'll fee good about yourself. I can't speak for how much energy you'll have at that point, but ride the adrenaline and push through the pain. <br>  <br>  I hope this works out for you. Best of luck in your race.|`|BB6HGbnPaa	Work on your timing. Because after the first lap, you would get tired. So work on what time your first lap should be and still have enough energy to finish the second lap. Also, work on your endurance so you can still be fast on the second lap.|`|jtvrSod4aa	conditioning and breathing rhythmically would help reduce lactic build up and you would be able to push more and get get a faster time|`|DVG9hV1Daa	Don't use a block. I don't know anyone who does, and it wouldn't seem to help at all. get a quick start and kick it in at the end.<br>  <br>  right now you need to train by doing distance so that you have that at the core, then you do speed work later on.

ja7kdPIGaa	Showmanship and precision are both key things judges look at. Don't fake or be cheesy; they can tell when you're actually enjoying yourself and when you're forcing yourself to smile. Also, tight tumbling gets you madddd points. If they're doing an interview question (like I did at tryouts) they want to see that you are a person of high self morals and a girl that can carry your school with pride. <br>  <br>  Have fun! :)|`|PxtmMAMnaa	first off, its really helpful to have tumbling. if you dont have any experience with tumbling, you will need to try really hard to make up for it! make sure it looks like you are putting effort into it. smile, be tight, and be confident! Judges at my school arent so interested in stunting since the level of a flyer, base, or backspot is not exactly reflected in their whole group. Also, you will be tested on jumps. make sure to have proper execution even if your jumps arent really high like toes pointed, chest up, arms strait. good luck!|`|nGFypfAhaa	you must really really enjoy it, judges will look at spirit. cheerleading is about enjoying yourself. also seem eager to learn, and dont attract too much attention to yourself or they may think you will be too much of a handful. remember have fun and keep smiling! Good Luck!!!
M6PFNVv6aa	Cheerleading is not all it's cut out to be. A lot of the girls on the team become jerks. Take it from someone who was on a team for 4 years. It is early work, meaning you have to wake up early a lot. It's heavy activity. Basically, if you want to make it, get the dance and cheer they have you try out with down pat. Video them doing it so you can go home and practice. They will also want to see A LOT of stunting. (backflips, handsprings, etc.) If you cant do a backhandspring, dont count on making the team.|`|PxtmMAMnaa	i dont know how good you are and what kind of cheer you are trying out for, but it usually takes some type of tumbling. if you dont have tumbling, make sure to smile more and be tighter than the other girls to make up for it! also practice jump form like toes pointed, chest up, etc.|`|JWTYesO9aa	You have to have.<br>  a) a peppy personality<br>  b) some tumbling. (Go to a gym! Don't try @ home.)<br>  c) be able to dance.<br>  d) stay tight through out your cheer.<br>  e) good jumps. (Toetouch or herky.)<br>  f) good facial expressins.<br>  DONT just smile! MAke different happy faces!<br>  Show them you are having fun!!<br>  And if you dont make it, thats okay!<br>  Just prepare for next year.<br>  WHich can be just as fun!<br>  but make sure you aren't trying out for popularity!<br>  People can tell.<br>  Just be yourself!<br>  Its way more fun!<br>  Cheerleading is a HARD sport that takes a lot of time!<br>  AND WORK!<br>  But, if its something you love, keep trying!<br>  Good luck!<br>  (My tryouts are soon!)|`|zXh8TUlgaa	i have a cuz and she does cheerleading and she was woried too. and she hurt her back so thats 2 times as worst. but she still made it. and all it takes is style and being flexable|`|Aj2DUektaa	well first of all u cant be like obese or anything...petite and muscular but not extremely muscular and hulky looking.<br>  <br>  also, it helps if uve done gymnastics b4.

IMu3wBu8aa	It's not as huge, but it hasn't lost anything. I think it's still a big deal. It's my favorite title belt. They don't pay as much attention to it as they used to (or even should), but that's because it's been all about the WWE/WHC titles. I've noticed each Era has a certain title that was more popular than others. I think the IC  title is still going strong. I would like to see it defended a bit more, but it's still here and getting good air time. It's the Cruiserweight title we should be worried about. Hardcore title too. I would like to see the IC get more respect, but I'm just happy it's still being defended.<br>  I think William Regal was a great IC title holder. CM Punk is a pretty good one as well. I just want more matches dedicated to that belt, rather than people just wearing it. I still see good in it though. Like I said, it's my favorite belt. I pay a lot attention to it.|`|63ce14dc7c788e16d783f90000ca7bc5aa	I know what youre sayin man, now its just a title to boost up a rookie's carreer to becoming good, the WWE's main concern about titles are their world titles. back then there was only 1 world title, thats why the IC title was significant I guess.|`|26fb51ead612e7006829de7144c65343aa	its the same with the U.S. title, <br>  <br>  those titles lost there value's a while back, now people only care about the main eventers with the World titles... i dont know why but it was better back in the day when people like Stone Cold held IC title.|`|77uc2xXUaa	I know, everything has lost its value.  The Intercontinental Championship, the WWE Championship (Jeff Hardy held it), WHC (Great Khali held it),  and the ECW Championship (Vince held it)|`|QbY18bjkaa	they gave it to bullshit ppl <br>  <br>  Cm punk<br>  its dumb<br>  <br>  <br>  kane jbl hbk randy orton y2j  all these superstar would have brought meaning to this title again.<br>  <br>  I remember guys like hbk razor would put there bodies on the line for this title, hhh vs the rock ladder IC title match is the best match for a title to this date or when y2j fought chris benoit,  <br>  <br>  now its a toy<br>  everything lost meaning wwe title look like ah freaking toy,|`|xUsUNGYyaa	i got one reason why and that is because look at the 2 holders this year of the belt.<br>  1.Jeff Hardy he is a good entertainer but look at what he has done in his career.he gets fired from te wwe once for no showing and doing dope,then what happens ROH gives him a chance he does the same thing there and got lazy.Then TNA gave him a chance there but he did the same thing his work ethic is nil to none in his career.<br>  2.Santino he was a joke in the WWE for most part while he had it sort of like a clown.Even though he was funny with his promos or whatever he just didn't have the respect of the fans like mr perfect and others had|`|KVTW6mCzaa	Well we have to go back a bit to last year. WWE wanted to give Y2J a title so they did not give him the World heavyweight gainst orton. So they gave him the ic title right in the middle of his HUGE feud w/ HBk and batista!!! he literally defended it like 4 times!!!|`|6KZA7D97aa	i totally agree... the IC belt used to be great, now its nothing. no i dea why... i guess its cos the WWE isnt as good these days.|`|09s0r130aa	Cause now the ic title is like the US champsionship<br>  played around by mid carders<br>  really disappoints doesn it|`|Q1MI6L96aa	All of the belts were cheapened during the Attitude Era, which was masterful work by Vince. Austin and Rock could headline without a strap and oftentimes were better in story lines without the gold. The IC - back in the day - was coveted by talent worldwide...now, it means nothing.|`|FEViNlQMaa	WWE is trying to make the IC title and US balance for both brands
i99wjcNYaa	I was surprised when I heard Big Show would be in the main event but it does add something to the match. I can see this match not living up to previous world title matches including last years Edge Vs Undertaker but then with both Orton Vs HHH and Michaels Vs Taker this is not even the main event so I am not too disappointed but Cena will win.<br>  <br>  BQ: Originally I thought it would be John Morrison but it doesn't look like he will be in it so I suppose I would have to go for MVP although it would be kind of cool if Kane won it.|`|U6tE9LhJaa	John Cena is going to obviously win<br>  *sigh*<br>  <br>  BQ: Kane|`|OGPW7xZ2aa	shoule be a good match and kane should win the mitb|`|ZK3x8pbBaa	I think this match is better then Cena vs Edge Alone.<br>  <br>  And i think Shelton or MVP will win the MITB|`|IgDCjui5aa	John cena vs big show vs edge is going to suck and i am 100 % know there going t do that. I'd rather see Cena vs edge in a TLC match. MITB and HBK vs the deadman are the only good matches, a lthough the build up of triple h vs rko is good. Anyway the MITB winner is between rey mysterio, gold standard, or MVP.<br>  <br>  And they better not do big show vs edge is going to suck even more then the triple threat.|`|5jIdcbyYaa	wm 25 only has 3 good matches<br>  <br>  MITB<br>  RANDY ORTON VS TRIPLE H<br>  HBK VS TAKER<br>  <br>  It's too early to judge but damn.. they should at least make it more interesting... cus its the 25th anniversary!!

z7JsVzcnaa	When I was in high school, I was in a similar situation with martial arts.  I had soccer and lacrosse at school going on the entire year and doing martial arts in addition to the other sports was too much.  My dad really kept pushing the martial arts thing to the point that I quit.  He was pissed off at me, gave me all the speeches about commitment and a bunch of other BS.  I stood my ground.  He wasn't happy for a while, but eventually it was over.<br>  <br>  If you really don't have the passion for the game, stop playing.  It might be uncomfortable for a while, but it's better than being miserable playing a sport you don't like.|`|0XI5eP70aa	Sometimes its hard to confront a person verbally when you can already expect their reaction. What I would do is just write him a very detailed letter stating how you don't have the same passion for football like he does and maybe even try doing something in the place of football so it doesn't seem like your trying to be lazy. Let him know your other interests and ask for his support. Pray about it as well and when you write him leave it in a place where he will find it and can read it while your away at school. I hope this helps. Good luck|`|CaqdDzQZaa	Bit the bullit and tell him ever thing in stead of making up story's he be madder if you lie to for a long time so i think the head on approach is best thing to do

H3nbC71eaa	Dino Bravo was very underrated. He was very good in the ring, though I only saw him during his WWF days. But you can see he had more to him in the ring while he was there. IMO, he could've been a big heel for the company if given the opportunity.<br>  <br>  BQ: I'll go with William Regal, because though Dino Bravo was a powerful grappler...it's just in the WWE that Regal is using the brawler style. He is a much better in ring talent than just the brawling he does now. Regal knows so many moves and holds because of the catch as catch can style of wrestling which is from Europe. It basically involves a whole lot of wrestling holds....and Regal is great at it. He was much more of a wrestler in his WCW days. I think he would've beat Bravo because of that.|`|QouSk1E7aa	Actually Regal is more of a shooter/technician.<br>  <br>  Maybe Bravo from the early 80's before he hit the roids, but not post roided up Bravo. He was better when he was a high flying technical wrestler.<br>  <br>  Bravo was on steroids, because he even admitted so himself|`|gNeFtZdBaa	who the hell is brovo is he a crickter?|`|Q1MI6L96aa	Did that guy get in too deep with legit organized crime.

He did put on interesting matches. He was one of those guys that were there, but weren't appreciated the way he probably should have been.

I watch it whenever it is on TV and I never miss an episode of it. I've tried watching other promotions like TNA but I didn't think any of them were as entertaining as the WWE.

Sometimes though, WWE dissapoints me with the lack of wrestling so immediately after Smackdwon goes off I'll go to Google video and watch rare ROH matches.|`|1z7M3Tntaa	Pro Wrestling NOAH, no way anyone can wacth that and not be entertained|`|UWJinEbIaa	HD Net is the #1 source for Combat Sports!  K-1 Dynamite, Dream, Sengoku, WEC, ROH.   ESPN Classic is the source for daily AWA and/or UWF goodness of the Midnight Rockers, Curt Henning, Scott Hall and the long list of "Before they were in WWF" stars....|`|S0u3HKzhaa	WWE<br>  <br>  BQ: Actually I usually will not watch anything after Smackdown.I usually just go to bed sometimes loll.But I usually will watch Family Guy or fall asleep to my fiancee flipping through the channels.|`|smcDn76jaa	WWE obviously. They have the most shows to watch.<br>  <br>  BQ- Well since my TV doesn't work and I watch on the Internet, I either checkout some indy matches or I go on Yahoo Answers.|`|BAurzDXtaa	TNA because it reminds me of WCW<br>  <br>  BQ: King Of The Hill
br1kwegaaa	The reason his stats are down is that the coaching staff at Lottomatica Roma has limited his minutes.  His low 3 point shooting % and low # of assists per game does raise several eyebrows among NBA scouts that was hoping he would stand out vs. the Euros.  But he is getting much better coaching now than if he had gone to college.  <br>  <br>  In the NBA, you get drafted by potential vs. actual statistics.  Jennings still has the most pure talent of any PG entering the draft including Ricky Rubio.  (Personal Note: I think Rubio is a better NBA prospect than Jennings).  As you have accurately noted, he has not been lighting it up in Europe and his draft status has become somewhat shaky because of that.  Depending on how Jennings performs in his workouts w/ NBA teams in the offseason, that will determine if he is a top 5 pick or a low lottery selection.|`|GL920Xv5aa	Another black man running for easy money, should of stayed in school|`|6yoQhXsOaa	He's really good.|`|8pS0oT4faa	I think hes smart|`|yO4vhNM9aa	who?|`|21XmVm6Zaa	he's a good talent but i know people that knew him from high school and he kinda reminds me of Allen iverson.  he's an incredible talent dont let his stats from europe fool you but i'd be worried about having him in the locker room<br>  <br>  edit- for one italian coaches are rough they are not going to give it to you easily and they practice twice a day once in the morning and then afternoon. two- brandon jennings is not used to a long season which is why i think he should have stayed in school and not gone for the easy money<br>  3- europes game is a lot different 4-he is 18 or 19 and trying to live somewhere completely different than anything he has ever experienced
ghLcOsnnaa	yes he is the best big man now|`|EATiw2Rqaa	Duncan is very good and has the rings to prove it but if you were starting a team today I think you'd go with Dwight Howard.|`|AA11488609	Tim is arguably the best big man in the league but he is at the end of his prime... I'd go with Dwight and Yao as the best big men now.|`|6iuZEUhzaa	no<br>  dwight howard<br>  magic have better record<br>  Duncac: 18.9 ppg<br>  howard: 21.1 ppg<br>  Duncan: 9.1 rpg<br>  howard: 11.2 rpg|`|0fb4ce4da0f3875154ab271a088412fcaa	Tim Duncan is not the best "big man" in the NBA right now. Tim Duncan usually plays PF and I would consider the best Power Forward in the game aside Bosh. Bosh is in his prime and putting up numbers that some other guys aren't but still Bosh is great. Duncan is probably the best Power Forward to play in the longest time and who is playing right now, arguably there will be a broad discussion but Duncan is possibly the best Power Forward in the game right now.|`|AdSc1Vbiaa	duncan is very consistent, but he is not the best AT THE MOMENT, u cant take away on how dwight howard has single handedly changed his team, and hes only 21 years old, imagine when he gets to duncans age|`|L8bUjthkaa	What about dwight howard, Shaq, KG, C bosh ???<br>  They are better than Duncan in my view|`|014d662e9ccdcc2dfcbd68b27f469d57aa	No<br>  Dwight Howard<br>  Yao Ming<br>  Shaq<br>  Amare<br>  Kevin Garnett

014d662e9ccdcc2dfcbd68b27f469d57aa	Kwame Brown|`|vFbzBo4eaa	I agree Kwame Brown was a better dunker and plus he wasn't a cry baby<br>  Is Kwame still in the nba?|`|BTZ4vFKJaa	glen davis all day|`|dcNT65mTaa	I'll take Glen Davis over Brown any day. Kwame Brown was a #1 pick and plays, in my opinion, just a step above 2nd rounder Glen Davis. I know u can't teach height, but you sure as hell can teach them basketball. Picking Davis, u save money, time, and get almost the same quality of play.|`|yt05KPhBaa	Glen Davis<br>  <br>  Edit: And stop hatin on Glen Davis. He played a good game and the Cavs got beat, plain and simple.|`|NxKjrz7xaa	there even, they both dont know to play the game of basketball|`|yO4vhNM9aa	idk they both suck|`|0fb4ce4da0f3875154ab271a088412fcaa	Glen Davis is honestly the better man. Kwame Brown doesn't do jack for his team and even though he was the 2001 1st draft pick he isn't better. Kwame Brown might play cleaner but he can't do anything. Glen Davis also averages more points, and his dirty fouls aren't really something that take away from the team.|`|21XmVm6Zaa	come on this is an offensive question kwame has better skills but he doesn't use them, i think he just doesnt have a high basketball iq which is  why he'll never be a tim duncan now glen davis is not as good as brown but he has a higher basketball iq....but overall kwame|`|NFzgUqzvaa	Glen Davis.|`|W7Dr5YaEaa	Kwame.|`|ghLcOsnnaa	glen davis|`|6yoQhXsOaa	Kwame Brown|`|Hvhynlftaa	Glen Davis. <br>  <br>  Kwame is just...

vFbzBo4eaa	I agree with you man.Of he stayed in the game he would get some nice 17 or 18 points and would had more minutes but now he's destroyed that<br>  He's dirty,cry baby|`|BTZ4vFKJaa	*****|`|rZmiyAqJaa	you just proved that you either know nothing about basketball or that you don't have the slightest bit of objectivity. sad, either way.|`|dcNT65mTaa	He wasn't great in college and now he's even more mediocre. Put him on any other team and he'd actually be worse. He got the benefit of landing on a championship team|`|NxKjrz7xaa	his just a big baby|`|yO4vhNM9aa	lol|`|qSsLPBo3aa	hmmm. Actually. I don't think he is as bad as you say. Yes he is a tad short for his position, and fat okay he's not that fat just built. But if you've actually seen him played, you'd see that he is getting better. I mean he's played against big guys and out played them. His shooting is become a lot more better. He can actually knock down shoots, and he isn't afraid to take them. He's pretty aiight with me, he is always willing to play and he's always ready. <br>  <br>  And he's been doing a pretty good job taken Garnet's spot. And if you haven't notice everyone plays dirty come on now, this ain't the peace town. it's basketball.|`|kDNE2kw5aa	They guy clearly is not very good, he come off the bench he was barley in the rotation last year and the only reason he is getting more playing time this years is because Perkins and Garrett have been hurt and PJ Brown retired again.  He is undersize for his position and a little heavy for the NBA.|`|puBKfWmyaa	He was a kickass College Player, people compared him to Shaq (also LSU alum). His nickname was "Baby Shaq".<br>  <br>  I thought he would turn out to be a fine NBA player, but I guess not.|`|ks54akugaa	Isnt he the crybaby?<br>  Whoa celtics got 2 crybabies on their team, <br>  wait 3 with Stephanie Mary burry|`|VLlP40L5aa	all i'm gonna say is this: he didnt flat out suck last nite when the celtics beat the cavs. he had 10 points. him and kendrick perkins were killin down low. shows how much you know|`|C4mzZwiWaa	ME...
I5FsYmjIaa	What?<br>  Naa I dont think so dude...<br>  Hahah <br>  Yep he is good but he does need more time|`|4AfL5ecuaa	Well if he goes there, that's a good start, no rush. I mean id be content with that. This guy has so much upside and with time as he shuts out the entire turkish league, he will be noticed and then go to a bigger team. Like im glad Guardado and Salcido are playing in ok teams bc they are getting their foot in the door to bigger leagues or more prestigious clubs. That's how Marquez did it. He was amazing in Monaco back in the day and now will probably retire with Barcelona. So it would be a great start for Memo. Keep in mind that Galatasaray S.K. Particapates in the big euro tournaments like Champions league and UEFA.|`|qbPbvLuLaa	I doubt he would go by next season but I hope he does because his level has dropped with america. I don't care what team he starts with as long as he gets experience and doesn't become too cocky. If he does he will make history for being the first Mexican golie in first division in Europe.|`|d006c09fcf96a47861ea8ba43ac7673faa	BULLSHYYYT. NO offence But Ochoa needs to be in a BIG TEAM. HE doesnt need to proove anything.

And Galatasaray? Come on he can do better than that.|`|82fd54d1c65455ed9c17232b1e7b390baa	That would be cool. Even better it would be cool once Ochoa knows how to speak Turkish style =D.|`|SvNcWfdJaa	nah i dont think so he could do alot better|`|f4w9NkETaa	I would like to see him in a top team... that would be badass|`|JTUy0F6Waa	Without a link to prove it, its just a rumor, same thing that happens every month, *ochoa to man u, ochoa to barca, que va al milan" and at the end in less than 1 week the rumor disappears.<br>  <br>  But if he goes than the best for him is to secure that he is going to be a starter, if he goes as in "just in case my goalie gets injure" than kick Galatasaray's offer right away.|`|rQ9Fl0jlaa	i dont think so but if he did he can do WAY better then Galatasaray
hLSIRDtZaa	I'm a Dwayne Wade fan myself. Die hard fan! I agree with the two answers before me including your first answer...Dwayne Wade is a beast. I believe he's way more talented than either of the two. Do you remember the Mavericks and Heat Finals? Triple teamed are you kidding me? He's at that performance level again because he's healthy and playing his best ball in years. Wade for MVP! ESPN, NBA, TNT....you need to know that Wade should be the Regular season MVP!|`|N3AiQRJFaa	He is right behind LeBron and Kobe, they were even thinking to replace Wade for kobe but Lakers are just doing too good. Wade is getting the respect and if his team was a little bit better he would win the the mvp race.<br>  <br>  Player's Performers + Team Record = MVP for some reason.<br>  So Kobe is winning this, he is just getting started and wade<br>  is doing all he can just to his team can make it to the playoff.|`|utbfT0APaa	What is your definition of Respect.|`|c6a6e99e34da0a5df1d14201ee7ccc64aa	he have great stats but his team isn't that good.|`|AA10863855	Wade has been putting up some great numbers.  He'll get some votes for MVP.  I don't think he'll win.  In the NBA, unfortunately, team success is a big factor.  No one has been named MVP on a team that has had less than 50 wins in about 25 years.  Miami can only lose 4 more times.  With Kobe and Lebron doing well on championship caliber teams, expect one of them to win MVP.|`|H8u7gMAYaa	Man, you guys keep saying he is not getting the respect, but if you watch NBATV or ESPN they are always talking about him possibly being the MVP this year.<br>  <br>  He is getting the respect he deserves, chill out.|`|F05yVezraa	I really dont know. Probably because his team isnt doing that well. But it isnt his fault because they are inexperience and young. But I totally agree with u, he needs to be more respected for a nominee for MVP ! Go D-Wade|`|ceQqYxtnaa	...RESPECT is not a gimmie --- RESPECT is earned|`|L8bUjthkaa	D wade is the beast<br>  <br>  He is not getting respect because he is underrated.|`|NFzgUqzvaa	His team standing made MVP impossible for Wade.|`|nBqZBbtnaa	Because his team is barely above .500 in a weak East conference.|`|yt05KPhBaa	Their team isn't in the top 3 seeds.|`|cMGFHMDQaa	That's a tough one.  Especially since Dwyane's been doing so good lately.  But if everyone had to choose between wade and kobe, most people would say kobe.  Wade's good, but he's not as good a shooter.  that's probably the biggest reason.|`|KO7mPumOaa	underrated. MVP should be based more on individual than team. in our hearts he is the MVP. he playing better than anyone else and is the best in NBA|`|Qyk0Rdu5aa	Wade is a beast<br>  Who cares about lebron<br>  But I think the reason is that he has a not as good team|`|TkhyRHITaa	His team isn't doing as well as the Lakers, Cavs, Magic, Celtics|`|wGO7thhwaa	because his team is the 5 seed.<br>  LeBron and Kobe's teams are 1 seeds|`|GMGlCXbiaa	because people are gay|`|5TPaYv3Vaa	that what i think and i just hate how people think lebron and kobe is better and should be mvp but people are understanding that wade is mvp|`|dcNT65mTaa	The MVP over the years has changed in meaning drastically. When Nash won twice in a row, it was supposedly because of what he meant to his team's success. Then they gave it to Dirk cause he was the best player on the best team only for them to lose in the first round of the playoffs. Then followed that up with the Lifetime Achievement MVP to Kobe who should have got it years back and didn't even though Chris Paul had better numbers than the both years when Nash won it. It's more popularity than it is about the numbers, and the significance of the players involved.
7X1H2AfWaa	they can go for the sixth, but i think that they wont reach the 5th or 4th seed. Im a bulls fan, and i underestimate them. Their problem is the road, where they lost to the bobcats, pacers, nets, and wizards all after the allstar break. i think they are 4-4 since the allstar break, which is weird because they lost all their road games and won all their home games in the stretch. if they can possibly win one or two of their road games, they can look to reach for the sixth or seventh seed. i would be happy if they played the cavs or magic, because they can beat them.|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Knicks are better than the Bulls. Knicks beat Chicago once this year. The other game Knicks should have won, but Larry Hughes (who is a Knick now) hit a game winner. 2 more games to go and Chicago is only 4 games ahead of NY. By seasons end Knicks would have this.|`|dcNT65mTaa	The highest they can get is a possibly but distant 6. They need to play consistent and aggressive here on out to do so cause the big guns are coming and playing hot one night, and not the next won't cut it.|`|NxKjrz7xaa	they made a good trade, hey do u play nba 2k9 i seen ur screen name before, well anyways the skys the limit, with the addition of Salmons, Miller and Hinrich back, they are young and talented, go bulls brin|`|yO4vhNM9aa	lose in first round, i think, but they have a chance to go far if they step up their play|`|NFzgUqzvaa	first round.

He's just to popular. It's the same thing with Shawn Michaels, both of them are such huge stars with such big fan bases that the crowds would never turn on them, no matter how management booked them. <br>  I think that for the upcoming Undertaker-Shawn Michaels match they'll have The Undertaker act more as the heel, but cutting edgier promos and such, but he won't actually turn. It'll be kind of the same thing that Michaels did last year with Ric Flair. Leading into that match he was giving pretty heel like promos on RAW but he wasn't a heel for the match at Wrestlemania.|`|w2nMrQzwaa	maybe because they think they need taker or hbk to turn heel for the match at Wrestlemania, they could have them both as face, but the storyline would be better if one of them turned heel, i think its more likely to be HBK who turns

vIVrQbOdaa	Really work on your conditioning. I'm not sure when your high school try outs are, but ours are in the fall. Soccer is a game of a lot of running, and at the high school level, a lot of games are won and lost by which team has enough energy at the end. Also, i would start working on shotguns. Those little foot drills your coaches make to improve your touches. Toe touches, triangles, X's, the side to side touches with the inside of your feet (i forgot the name of that one).|`|RWmJpDdNaa	alright what u got to do it train you hardest<br>  <br>  when i started playing soccer the team i was trying out for the girls had years on me buh i trained everyday to get to there level now i am the best in my team after just 2 yrs<br>  <br>  when your playing soccer just buh dont try too hard cos it just doesnt work play fair dont do and dirty tackles the last thing a coach wants is a rat player<br>  <br>  a good way to get better fast is to get just a flat wall and keep kicking ball to it with both right n left feet <br>  <br>  what postion are you trying out for|`|f6d7c6d91c363f156f7b6ae7975913abaa	go out and try your hardest. act enthusiastic about playing for the coach and maybe even go out and watch a few of the games. the coach will have comments for his own team and you can listen to them and work on what his team needs to work on. High school soccer isnt a big deal so dont stress too much on it.. you will do fine :)|`|gCoqslUGaa	it depends on if its a co-ed team or not<br>  if its a boys team like at my school..... start running as soon as summer begins.. they do alot of running and drills. start praticing too. try to prove yourself. and make sure the coach knows that you're here to play and your not giving up.<br>  <br>  if its a girls team.... no idea.... good luck|`|wXaGIPSPaa	Intro yourself to the soccer coach this year.  Ask her for hints on things you can do this summer that would help you do well so you can be selected for the team.  Ask her if there are any camps she reccommends that you go to this summer and if there is any volunteer opportunities for you to help out with too.<br>  The coach needs to recognize you and know who you are and how much soccer means to you.  <br>  Good luck. Soccer is a great sport and also has lots of scholarship opportunities.
F9wSMCKmaa	I hope it's Newcastle because they're fans can't get it into they're heads that they were never a big club. You didn't win the title under Keegan. He screwed it up and you still adore him. <br>   <br>  I personally see Stoke and either Blackburn or Newcastle. There is a clause in Allardyce's contract that says if Blackburn go down he will get the sack.<br>  <br>  Stoke just aren't good enough while Newcastle will just collapse.|`|w8ucfG3Qaa	Probably Stoke and maybe Blackburn. I hope Blackburn don't get relegated because they have a couple of Aussies. I think Stoke will get relegated because they simply don't have enough skill.

Im pretty sure WBA will go down as they leak way too many goals. I think that Stoke will survive, The Britannia's become a bit of a fortress for them. I think Newcastle and Portsmouth both have enough talent in their players to stay up. Therefore i think WBA, M'Boro and Blackburn will go down.

And actually, if you don't like promos then ECW beats out both RAW and SmackDown!|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	Smackdown is still a lot more entertainment than wrestling compared with Ring of Honor. ECW is actually the WWE's wrestling show for me, not much in the way of story's out of ECW just youngsters having matches. <br>  <br>  The WWE is much more about entertainment than wrestling so if you prefer the WWE to ROH then your an entertainment fan right? If it's wrestling related like Raw is it belongs in this section and your dismissive attitude towards those that prefer Raw is at best pitiful and shows a lack of maturity on your part.|`|U6tE9LhJaa	SD! is my favorite|`|h5lOMoqBaa	Technically ECW is probably more of the wrestling show than either of the other two, which is sad to say, but true.<br>  <br>  PS: if you want real wrestling, watch ROH|`|zpIKtqNvaa	Me too, Smackdown is my favorite and should be flagship

8fa17d06395754a44604a2b42063588daa	This fight almost happened.  The only thing that prevented Rocky from comming out of retirement is that he realized he'd still be under contract with Al Weill.  He'd had enough of that bad deal. <br>  <br>  Rocky was a nice guy.  But "nice" doesn't get you 49-0.  Say what you will but he kicked EVERYBODY's *** during his time.  He beat the best out there.  He wasn't so nice that it didnt bother him to see such a weak champion wear the crown.  Im sure Rocky KNEW he could beat Patterson and wanted to prove it.  <br>  <br>  IF only there wasnt the problem with Al Weill.  <br>  <br>  Floyd keeps Rocky off for a little while but, with all his hand speed, he would fail to hurt or even gain Rocky's respect.  Only Rocky's lack of hand speed keeps this from becoming the "Prequel" of Tyson-Spinks.<br>  <br>  Floyd can't take a punch and doesn't have the footwork to escape for long.  It's only a matter of time.  Floyd KO'd Johannson but then who couldn't do that?  Besides,  Ingo could crack but he didn't take the best punch and he never took the sport seriously.  <br>  <br>  Marciano's NO Ingo.  Floyd plays the part of Ingamar where he lies, foot twitching, on the canvas.<br>  <br>  Marciano by KO in 5|`|8Sw8rJgtaa	Floyd was a good fighter.He would have boxed well against Marciano,most guys did...until they got caught.Floyd had very good speed and footwork,but not a lot of power.He was undersized for the division and was basically a bulked up light heavyweight.That being said Marciano would not really have a size advantage on Floyd just a power advantage.Floyd would out box him for much of the first half of the fight,maybe even hurt him at one point but not bad.Marciano would have to apply constant pressure and wear him down with body shots.In the later rounds Rocky's stamina and body work take over.Rocky starts landing more frequently and backs Patterson into the ropes where he unloads.Patterson would definitely make a good fight of this and open cut on Rocky,Floyd was no punk he just had problems.Patterson avenged his loss to Ingo by knocking him out in both rematches,and took the "almighty" Ali 12rounds with a busted back.Anyway i still pick Rocky to win by K.O. in the 14th.|`|Xm8crry3aa	I say the Rock knocks out Floyd in under 3 rounds. Floyd was not a real heavyweight besides he had a glass jaw and Rocky could hit. One suzie-q and it is over.|`|Fx2lB9LYaa	i agree with maurice patterson had the speed and better boxing skill but once rocky reached pattersons chin ko|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	once rocky catches him its over speed floyd had not enough rocky in 3|`|kqP7GwOcaa	Rock would have KOed Floyd, pretty much like Liston did, I don't think either Patterson or Johannson could have done much with Marciano.  The fight that might have given Marciano trouble was Liston.|`|uoZIYhJtaa	Lucky for Floyd that Rocky "ducked" him (he didn't...there was no market for this fight).<br>  <br>  Marciano would have won an easy KO.<br>  <br>  Interesting note: I've read that Rocky only one time considered coming out of retirement to fight again for the championship. It was after Ingamar Johanson won the title in 1959. Rocky actually started training, but gave it up when he realized that the commitment was not there.|`|dh48AkbCaa	i think floyd would get off to a good start, outboxing marciano and trying to keep the fight at long range, but is unsuccessful with his leaping left hook after landing the first one.<br>  <br>  once the rock finds the range to counter said left hook, it's all over in the fifth or sixth, with the scorecards about even.|`|Yg1QR4mmaa	I say the Rock takes him out in a furious three rounds, Floyd is not strong or big enough to keep him off of him and while he might of dropped Rocky for maybe a two or three count he would of brutally beaten chances are.<br>  <br>  My pick is Marciano by 3rd round KO.|`|910875de6723862c69bd16bf9f5b2249aa	Marciano would win by KO.  Patterson was a great role model for boxing in and out of the ring but his chin would not last 3 or 4 rounds against Marciano.
8Sw8rJgtaa	The difference between Jefferies and modern heavyweights is not that much size wise.Jefferies was 220lbs.of solid muscle,no supplements or unnecessary weight training or steroids.Many of today's heavyweights have a lot of bulk that is more show muscle than anything else,or they are on the chubby side.His trouble was slick boxers and he still beat them.How many slick boxing heavyweights have there been in the last 30-40 years not many if any.Jefferies had tremendous stamina and great power.In those days fighters didn't hold their hands up because they had to anticipate a 20 round fight,find me a heavyweight that can go 20 these days with all their "modern nutrition".They clinched and grabbed more but they were also much better inside fighters.Those old grainy films don't show much and you really have to know your stuff to tell the subtle aspects of the fight.I really think that the poor quality of those films influences peoples opinions negatively.Jefferies would probably take Cooney in the same manor that Foreman did,with a crushing blow in the early rounds.|`|8fa17d06395754a44604a2b42063588daa	Poor Jeff.  He's actually one of my favorite "Pre Dempsey" fighters, next to Johnson.  If he fought in another era he'd surely kick a lotta ****.  However, his one weakness against other champions is that he DIDNT fight in another era.  They didn't throw combinations or block well or use tools such as jabs.<br>  <br>  Even Jack Johnson, whom I think is just a bit over rated, esp. when people compare him to ALI,  Jack's defense was great for it's time but would serve him little in any time era after ALI.  <br>  <br>  BIG Jeff would have a puncher's chance against Cooney.  He certainly TAKES a better punch than Gerry.  However, we must give Cooney credit for his skills as well.  He wasn't a great boxer but he was better than he should have been.  Perhaps he should actually have been MORE of a puncher.  He doesn't take BIG Jeff out the way he took out Norton and others.  Jeff could take a beating with the best of them.<br>  <br>  The problem is that a beating is exactly what he would take.  Cooney doesn't measure up against many of the greats.  But the further back you go the better his chances simply because of the way they fought.  They lacked SO MUCH that the later fighters learned.  Even Dempsey get's no "Willard" here.  He'd have to earn his win.  He takes it but it wouldn't be easy.  Gerry has a good chance of taming him, at least for a while.<br>  <br>  BIG Jeff, whom I think could beat Dempsey only because of the way Jack WOULD fight,  has a better chance here to go the distance.  He could actually pull a "Tex Cobb"  (for those in the know)  and take Gerry to the wire, maybe even stopping him by simply outlasting him. <br>  <br>  However, I think the fact that Cooney would do a lot of damage with his power is what tips it in his favor.  People tend to think that fighters who never won titles have no chance over those who have.  <br>  <br>  I can think of a long list of champions who would lose to Earnie Shavers and another longer list of contenders who would beat Floyd Patterson easily.  In fact, Shavers, the King of Contenders KOs Patterson, the "Pawn" of champions, rather easily. <br>  <br>  But I think you get my point here.<br>  <br>  BIG Jeff never leaves his feet.  He just can't block the incoming. <br>  <br>  Cooney by TKO in 12|`|dh48AkbCaa	this one might go about 10 or 12 rounds until cooney tires badly, then jeffries ends it dramatically with a flurry, and the ref steps in to rescue cooney who is trapped on the ropes.|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	i think in 5|`|kqP7GwOcaa	Agreed, two difference classes of fighter.  Jeffries would have crushed Cooney.
4d7b908cfe24bf3f1177a5cca13feb22aa	While I believe Holmes won both fights, I can only say that Holmes was jobbed in the second fight.  The first fight was about slaps and missed punches that made-to-believe as though they were landing.  But it gave everyone an excuse to protect Rocky Marciano.<br>  <br>  Something that I might as well bring up now, is just how jumpy Spinks was, and he seemed to have lung and nasal problems between rounds.  Almost like a coughing fit that smoker's get in the A.M.  Since I don't know what being coked-up is about, I've sometimes wondered if Spinks had the same kind of help Aaron Pryor had.<br>  <br>  Let's all not forget that the AP had Holmes winning 9-6. Neither the AP, nor any of the sports media, were particularly fond of Holmes, as he spoke his mind rather then giving them juicy quotes.  So it's not as if we're talking about pro-Holmes bias.|`|Xm8crry3aa	I think Spinks won the first fight hands down. His style and angles seemed to confuse Holmes who i believe took him lightly cause he was just a light heavyweight. The second fight Holmes was robbed big time. He won 9 or 10 rounds and finally figured Spinks out. .|`|9SN1ARBfaa	I would have called them both for Holmes although the first fight was close. Second fight Holmes was shafted because he clearly won.|`|dh48AkbCaa	i agree with elmer.<br>  <br>  i watched both fights recently on youtube...spinks won the first, holmes was robbed in the second.|`|8fa17d06395754a44604a2b42063588daa	Boxing, being my favorite sport along with Football, I'd like to think that kind of thing does not happen in this sport.  However, it would be naive on my part to not see it for what it is.  <br>  <br>  For the sake of peace I will not comment on the first fight.  I don't think Larry had much chance unless he knocked Spinks out.  I think many, including the media, made too much of the Record of Marciano.  It doesn't help that Holmes took Spinks lightly.  All the others who gave Holmes trouble would NOT have done so against a Prime Holmes.<br>  <br>  The second fight was an ABSOLUTE TRAVESTY.  There is NO WAY that fight should have been taken from Holmes.  He won AT LEAST 9 rounds.  Last time I checked, 9 is more than half of 15.  If you look at Spinks after the fight you will know that HE KNEW he lost that fight.  <br>  <br>  It's a shame because it only made some happier when Spinks got starched by Mike Tyson.  Michael Spinks is certainly a credit to the sport and deserves his due credit.  But he did NOT deserve the decision in the Holmes rematch.  His mother can not even dispute that.|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	the first fight a draw or holmes won holmes won the 2nd one|`|kqP7GwOcaa	Some people believe that a group of old Italian guys with bent noses and huge bank accounts told Michael Spinks that if he was still standing, Rock's record was safe prior to the first Holmes/Spinks fight.  Truth is we will never know, but if I was scoring the fight, I would have given Holmes the nod by a round or two in a close one, and it really was a close fight.  I though Larry won, but the judges saw different, and if it was a fix, it was at least close enough of a fight to leave doubt.  It really could have went either way, it was that close of a fight.<br>  <br>  I don't believe Larry got ripped off, I just think Holmes didn't push the envelope enough in the biggest fight of his life, and left enough room for doubt that he blew it.  Larry was the champion in against a smaller man and he should have taken the judges out of it all together with a KO but like Hagler against Leonard, he just didn't do quite enough.
8fa17d06395754a44604a2b42063588daa	People often rate Tunney and Charles as the two best light heavyweights in history.  I agree but I have the order reversed.  I think "Quality of opposition" tips it in Charles' favor.  He's just a better over all fighter.  <br>  <br>  Tunney leaves him in the dust with footwork.  But Charles has ALL the answers.  He can do EVERYTHING.  His only weakness was Heavyweights. <br>  <br>  As for Greb,  people like to think he's the "Wolverine" of boxing history and would defeat many bigger men.  That's true, to a degree, but there are those whom he would have no such luck. <br>  <br>  Ezzard Charles is the ANSWER to TOUGH. You need MORE than the kind of Tough Greb can muster to beat Ezzard at his best.  It would take a Tough, but naturally BIgger fighter to beat Ezzard Charles.  He is perhaps the most under rated champion in history.  <br>  <br>  After his fatal KO win over Sam Baroudi, Charles lost something.  He was never the same and could never fully committ himself to hurt a man.  This and he STILL went the route with the Immortal Rocky Marciano, who LOOKED a lot bigger than he really was.  He gave Rocky all he could handle in both bouts.  <br>  <br>  Unless you're a full heavyweight,  Ezzard Charles has the answers.  Greb is great, certainly one of the Top 3-4 middleweights of all time.  But the Key here is "Middleweight".  Even though Charles himself was once a middleweight, he grew naturally into Light heavyweight and won more Heavyweight title fights than any other champion except Louis, ALI and Holmes.  <br>  <br>  He has it all over Tunney.  <br>  <br>  He'd have it all over Greb too.  However, He'd KNOW he was in a fight.<br>  <br>  Ironman beats Wolverine here.<br>  <br>  Charles by TKO in 14|`|kqP7GwOcaa	Great answer and thumbs up to galactus, but he is wrong.  If Greb could beat Tunney, Harry certainly could have beat Charles.|`|vLD8L1P0aa	i knew that there would be a big answer like that other d*cks answer and he'll probably get best answer but anyway, I think harry greb would win, the greatest chin.|`|dh48AkbCaa	charles would win 4 out of five with greb too.|`|thcr8Y5vaa	Ezzard Charles...|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	greb wins this one tough fighter for tough times ezzard good but not that good greb by decision
zdQWVaGsaa	This is a difficult one as both were in two completely different time periods but I give the edge to Lopez due to his great ring generalship and intelligence. Guilledo could fight and was durable but I think Lopez would have figured him out and won on points.
uTJsoYzzaa	Just guessing, but I think it's probably because there is already something very similar (baseball) already shown on TV.  I mean, why start in enterprise, when there is already one almost just like it already running?|`|gVYfFSpRaa	It's not the only sport...|`|QyJBl9aFaa	In order to get millions of dollars there has to be an audience that is willing to pay to see it.  Merchandise sales, etc.  Any sport will go "pro" if people actually support it.
FUoKu13Daa	Bynum might be the Lakers future but he might have the Chris mihms or bill Walton syndrome were he gets hurt a lot,  <br>  <br>  If I was Lakers management I would not trade him unless I can pick up a Chris Paul or Deron Williams.  The only reason that I would make that trade is if Bynum get another injury next year and is out any considerable amount of time then we have to pretty much realize this is what his career will be like and no team will make a trade for him knowing he is injury prone <br>  <br>  But Bynum has the potential to be one of the best big man in the league but like I said if I was management my only concern with him is his injury and try to determine if this is going to be oncurring.|`|uxregJ0faa	lol are you serious? Did you see Bynums production before he got injured. He has potential.<br>  <br>  <br>  What Kinda Laker fan are you?|`|vFbzBo4eaa	I don't think Lakers fans will agre with you man,if they trade him they wiuld go for some young talent.If they trade the can't take Blazers Oden but they would go for some like Al Jeferson<br>  <br>  But he's a good player and Lakers should keep him for a long time|`|dcNT65mTaa	Andrew Bynum is a tiresome work in progress.  U could get someone to stay healthy when it counts most by trading him. He's supposed to add toughness, but  then again I don't see it. He adds a little bit more post presence than they have with Gasol, but I think he's overrated, underachieves, and is too injury prone. Too much rides on player potential. I could of been a doctor, pay me a doctor's salary just cause of that! I'd take LaMarcus Aldridge for him in a possible trade.|`|wuDplG1qaa	Andrew Bynum is fat? WHat the ***** are you talking about? Look at his muscles. Also in the last 12 games before he got injured he was average 24pts 12rbs 3blks per game you moron.|`|GBGcI509aa	He isnt good period.<br>  <br>  And yes hes fat for the idiot that said he isnt.<br>  <br>  When you're luggin nearly 300 pounds theres fat some where.|`|kDNE2kw5aa	First of all who do you trade for?  A center cuz that would be the biggest need, who will trade a center for a center?  Bynum is still very young and has a ton of potential so there are defiantly takes out there but there is noway you get equal talent back.  It would be dumb to trade him for depth the lakers have plenty.|`|L66IcsuUaa	Are you serious? Do you really think someone would say "Yes let's trade him"? Yeah he sure is injury-prone when his TEAM-MATES gets tangled up with him and makes him fall on his knees! Yeah he's a Kwame Brown, when he can grab 42 points, 15 rebounds, and 3 blocks. He sure is fat when he works out every single day with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar! It's exactly like saying Kareem is a horrible trainer.|`|21XmVm6Zaa	i disagree bynum for one thing is not fat, hello have you seen how muscular he is? that would be saying dwight howard is fat and we all know that he is not. two he is not injury prone. the latest injury was bad luck not injury prone-ness. now someone who is injury prone is luke walton and his ankles but keep bynum he's a great talent|`|ALtYFc6Saa	I'm not even a Laker fan at all but that has to be the dumbest thing I have ever heard.<br>  <br>  Trade Bynum? And he's fat? Wow. I think you just gave Laker fans a bad rep.|`|h5OfQye0aa	He's our big man and he plays really well and he should stay.  He can reach his full potential in most games and is more aggressive than Pau Gasol.  So maybe you should change your mind!!!!|`|SV9AOJYhaa	I think Andrew Bynum is overrated like crazy|`|014d662e9ccdcc2dfcbd68b27f469d57aa	Sorry I don't follow the Lakers|`|yt05KPhBaa	I say shut up.
UG2VpQjaaa	Billups is a guy who will sacrifice anything to have his team be a contender, he is a great scorer but instead distributes the ball to everyone on the court while chipping in a good amount of points but never ballhogs, I have never ever seen him ballhog. Kenyon Martin has always been kinda iffy with his behavior and attitude, he had great potential a few years back but didn't really do much with it, now I don't expect much out of him.<br>  <br>  Andrei Kirilenko is alright I guess, I've never really paid attention to him, I think that with his length and timing he should be a whole lot more important to his team but he gets injured kind of often. I think if he had a good shot then he'd be a helluva lot better player but he's so inconsistant on scoring and his defense has taken a few hits as well so now he's a 15 million dollar bench player.|`|W7Dr5YaEaa	Chauncey Billups, he's a good team player and a great leader.<br>  <br>  AK47 is one of the best defensive players today.|`|pX2ZraBVaa	i like billups because he is a proven guard that can pass and shoot at the right times and lead a team to contention....just look at what he did for detroit the last couple of years and what he has done for denver this year<br>  kmart has been riddled with injuries for awhile and i dont think hes shown the abilities that he can possess<br>  <br>  kirilenko is decent because he provides stats for most of the categories in terms of fantasy basketball...however i dont think he has been that good this year|`|NFzgUqzvaa	I don't like King Mart and AK.AK is always annoying and he cried in public.  I like Chauncey.

He needs to get them playing NBA basketball and Nelson really doesn't seem to care.|`|mSChD7lMaa	It's the coaching.  Nelly doesn't know what he's doing.  That's why he never won a ring as a coach in the NBA.  Golden State has a great group of young guys.  It's a same that Nelson isn't using them properly.|`|NxKjrz7xaa	they should have stayed with the warriors who dominated the mavericks|`|sNQrJ6cfaa	It is the curse of the black pearl.

7nDpz7vyaa	Seems like they don't play hard unless they get down by 10 or 15 and a lot of times it's too late by then.  Hawks need a center.  Horford is a power forward.  The Bobcats game was horrible.  Hawks got punished on the boards and in the paint.  Need to trade the stubborn J Smoov for a center and move Horford to PF.|`|dcNT65mTaa	They've played down to the competition in recent times but not as much as most would say. The Bobcats are in a stride and Larry Brown has them buying into his defensive mentality and new personnel as well has them playing among the NBA middle class.|`|AA10744471	I completely agree with your observation. Against tougher teams, the Hawks play their hearts out and thus they win. But against weaker teams, they seem to play contentedly and thus they lose. It is really a matter of heart and resolve. Most fans would not actually notice this, but your insight and perception are really getting into the heart of the matter. That is why, every game in the NBA matters. Strong team or weak team, they must play with all their heart and the resolution to win the game. Good luck to you and God bless.|`|014d662e9ccdcc2dfcbd68b27f469d57aa	That's how it is with the Rockets. They beat teams like the Jazz, the Cavaliers, and Boston, but when it comes down to Memphis, or Minnesota, we lose. I think it has something to do with the mental state. They get over confident that their supposed to beat those teams, and they surprise them and lose. That's why you never take a team lightly. When you're winning you have to put a foot on their neck so they won't come back up.|`|uJB8ZCCraa	Both Yes and No. It really determines WHERE they play and WHO they play. They play well against GREAT teams at HOME. But great teams somewhere else is a little bit better than BAD teams. Just fire Woodson so you can get someone who can put Smith in his place and showing who the boss is. Which is the coach. (Sorry smith ur just inconsistent)|`|XJbcSg38aa	the hawks always play good!!!<br>  but against better teams they do a superb job!!!!!<br>   what a team they're UN believable!!!

And everything will be fine for the first year or two. But eventually, T.O's baggage will catch up with him. If he doesn't start something to get him thrown out, the media will. Its become too much of a pattern for him. I'll say Bills will get the Wild Card spot in the playoffs this year.|`|Fmhsy8CKaa	I'm glad that the Cowboys got rid of TO. He was becoming such a pain in the @ss, Without him I think the 'Boys will do better, I'm still hung up on the whole Kitna thing. We didn't need Henry anyway, but why Kitna? Of all the other possibilities for a back-up, they chose Kitna?<br>  The Bills are going to regret picking up TO, he does not play well with others. Although, T.O only signed a one year deal, so chances are that he'll try to behave so he can get re-signed the following season.|`|79fcba74979712e403883ffa306ec1ecaa	Whats funny is that Rosenhaus said "several teams were interested" if that is so...why would he end up with the sorry a$$ bills.|`|uHTpBjWDaa	I wouldn't have taken T.O.

FrojZ51oaa	well im not a coach but i am a gymnast and here are some things i like in a coach: pays attention to everyone equally. is nice, but i guess you should be strict too. i dont know what level you are coaching but if it is in an age group that does conditioning, dont make the team/class do a bunch the first day. gives good tips. but i have to say- if a gymnast knows what they are doing wrong try to help them, but if it is something simple, such as  cartwheel on beam, dont keep saying over and over and over "you have to go over the top more"  because it gets kinda annoying.. or  maybe im just stuck up haha..<br>  <br>       also, dont show up late (i doubt you would) but lately my coaches are slacking off, and our main coach and spotter rarely comes anymore. <br>        I dont know if i helped at all, but good luck, and i bet the kids will like you.|`|lJBGvpF9aa	o i love these questions!!!!! OK you really shouldnt be nervous cuz i think it would be fun 2 be a coach cuz im a gymnast!!! anyway....what i like in a coach would be for them to be fun but strict at the same time. coach them but be fun at the same time and really friendly. i have coaches that just make me laugh and want to work harder. tomorow introduce yourself and have fun with them and dont be to strict cuz then you wont be to nervous to talk to them or coach them.

Pc0QjrQ4aa	You want to eat complex (not simple) carbs.  Whole wheat bread, whole grains, fruit, veg.  Lean protein (typically I avoid beef).<br>  <br>  Usually, I'll eat a turkey/chicken sandwich on whole wheat bread around 3 hours before a game.  Personally, I don't want to feel full or bloated.  <br>  <br>  As a general rule, eating 5-6 smaller meals throughout the day is a good idea (although it can be tricky).<br>  <br>  Stretching...I'm a goalie, and its huge.  Typically, I'll do a few minutes of light jogging at the rink before I stretch (stretching cold muscles does no good).  Core, groin, legs all get a good loosener.<br>  <br>  Routine...I always try to get to the rink around 60 minutes prior to give myself time to lay out my equipment, stretch, and get dressed.  I usually drink a red bull before the game for that added boost.  I have an entire routine that is pretty much OCD defined.|`|3b1f171c73bb2e24acbb7271e47a68faaa	Carbos the day before... at least 12 hours before a game.  eat a good bunch of good whole grain carbos.  You dont have to carbo load, but you need to take in enough to give you the energy (ATP) that your body needs on gameday.<br>  <br>  One game day, keep hydrated with water... no need for powerades or gatorades... since you dont lose electrolytes that quickly (generally electrolyte replacement is needed for longer games like soccer 90 mins).  HOWEVER, do drink some gatorade if you are going into overtime!<br>  <br>  Stretch before the game.. a good 5 to 10 mins of running in place stretching the legs(thighs and calfs) as well as the back, the arms etc... it's important to stretch for several minutes.... <br>  <br>  My routine when I played was dress my lower half, stretch and take in some water... always take a dump and piss before you suit up lol... goes without saying but it really helps you feel lighter, more ready to go if you "eliminate" right before dressing....<br>  Id put on my ipod and get pumped to hardcore/upbeat hardcore songs.. then get together with the teammates and start to talk about the game....|`|JavoRs6Raa	1.Get your carbs (pasta is perfect) Drink gatorade for energy and hydration(electrolytes) and water as a substitute.  NEVER drink energy drinks before a game they are terrible for you and by the 3rd period you have a big crash in stamina.<br>  2.1.5 to 2 hours before the game<br>  3.i'd stretch for about 15 to 20<br>  4.I like to sit and just concentrate about what I'm going to do on the ice.  The odd time I sit and listen to my music, but for the 10 minutes before we hit the ice I completely zone out from everybody and everything.  Concentration is key.

AA12276356	Obviously nobody on here watched the 1991 NBA Finals between the Bulls and the Lakers ( Jordan vs. Magic).<br>  <br>  In game one, Magic basically had his way with Jordan, taking him down low and posting him up. It got so bad, that in game 2, Magic put Jordan in foul trouble, and Phil Jackson had to put Pippen on Magic, which helped to win the series for Chicago.<br>  <br>  Magic was a legitimate 6'8" and bulky. Jordan was about 6'5" and leaner. Magic would take Jordan in the post every time, and there is nothing Jordan could do to stop him.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, Jordan was one of the best at driving to the hoop, and is much, much quicker that Magic. The only hope that Magic would have is to make Jordan shoot from the outside, and if this is 1990, then Jordan still hasn't developed a great shot outside of 15 feet.<br>  <br>  As much as I hate to say it, I think Jordan would have the slight edge in a one on one game with Magic. That's not to say that I think Jordan is the better player because I don't. If they played each other 10 times, they'd probably each win 5.<br>  <br>  <br>  Just a note .... Contrary to popular belief, Magic DID NOT play center in game 6 of the 1980 championship. He did "jump" center for the opening tip, but then went back to playing guard/forward the rest of the game. Jim Chones was the center who filled in for the injured Kareem. It was more of a symbolic gesture by Magic to his teammates.<br>  <br>  Also, Kareem was the real MVP of that series. They gave it to Magic based on one game, but it was Kareem who carried the team the other 5 games, scoring over 30+ points in every game and blocking a bunch of shots. Kareem basically got screwed because Magic was more media friendly and Kareem was not.<br>  <br>  It was, however, a spectacular performance by the rookie Magic!|`|0fb4ce4da0f3875154ab271a088412fcaa	Jordan would win it. I love Magic Johnson, he is one of my favorite players but when he played he relied on his team most of the time and was a phenomenal PG though.

That is quite a ?. You did a good job of answering it also. The only problem is that you are very wrong. There is no disputing Magic's greatness. If you were talking rebounding Magic is a good choice.

I guess people haven't gotten over that yet Hogan had the title for four years. Theres more reasonable people to hate like roidtista, Triple H, Vince Mcmahon. I don't understand why people focus so much hate on one damn person its like they have no life. If the wwe championship is such a "toy" then don't you think triple h would have changed it by now??

XKunkO9jaa	This is a great question.  I would rather answer it then have people act like they know the difference.<br>  Am. Football is about yardage.  Players try to gain every inch they can.  The ball is thrown forward almost always. Football was somewhat derived from rugby.  Plays or short with lots of stoppage. 11 Players on the field normally.  Touchdown 6 pts, field goal- 3 pts, safety- 2pts (getting tackled in your own end-zone)<br>  I would like to add there is no difference between countries.  They are different versions of rugby.  Two different sets of rules.  One version may be more popular in one country or another but there are not different types based on the country.<br>  <br>  Rugby is about possession. Teams try to keep possession rather than gaining that extra inch.  Ball must be thrown lateral or behind the player with the ball.  Little or no stoppage of play.  There are no timeouts and only injury substitutions.  There are two types of rugby but I wont get into the differences because they are rather minute to someone just learning.  They are called League and Union.  11-15 players.  Elements of rugby-scrum (to win the ball over after a penalty), ruck (win the ball over after a tackle), maul (push players to gain distance).  Players can score a drop goal at any time also (like a field goal but while running).   Try (touch down actually the player must literally touch the ball down in the try zone) is 5 pts, conversion 2 pts (must be kicked through the uprights. no running it in for the conversion)<br>  <br>  There are other differences as well that are rather not really noticeable to viewers.  There are lots of rule/law differences as well.  Most tackles made by football players would be concidered high tackles in rugby.  <br>  <br>  The best way to learn is to watch/play.  I am usually against video games but those will help you in this situation also.  Email me if you have further questions.|`|16561360453f1fcbaf919e880b04e02caa	Rugby has no padding.  That sounds tough, but think about it.  If you are unarmored you don't run full speed into a wall.<br>  <br>  American Football players know they are armored so will go at top speed at each other.  In fact they want to use an armored part on them to hit the opposing player where he is unarmored.<br>  <br>  Oh, that supposes NFL not college.  In college they wear more pads.  In the pros they want to be fast so as much  weight as they can lose...

zCSBVAbyaa	Before you bash your own team think about the situation they are in right now. They haven't made the playoffs since 1998 and all three teams in the division are on the uprise. The Dolphins are improving and just made the playoffs, the Jets are signing key players in free agency (no good quarterback though), and the Pats are getting Brady back. The Bills have talent and need something to get them over the hump. I applaud Wilson for signing T.O. because it is only one year and if it works, he is a genius and if it doesn't, then they blame TO and are in the same position that they would be in anyway. I have a funny feeling now that the Bills will be a playoff team as AFC is getting weaker and they are constantly improving. They should get a wild card spot and can set a foundation if this experiment works. Go Bills!|`|xfJuyHoeaa	UPDATE: Owens is official a Buffalo bill signing a contract for 1 year here is what I think of it.<br>  <br>  Owens is a phenomenal player and can instantly improve any offense the problem is can he keep his antics to a minimum and not be a nuisance to the Bills. But with the Bills not a great QB T.O. could get pissy if the balls aren't thrown perfectly. Overall I think its a great pick up and its time for T.O. to stop acting like a kid and be a Baller which I think he will do I think this is the team where he will settle down.<br>  ===================================|`|Md6X39HUaa	Well, look at it this way. He is on a one year deal, so maybe he will be on his best behavior trying to get a long term deal.. and you can get one really productive year out of him. I can't imagine he will act like a douche on a one year contract... Im sure buffalo has made it so that if he Does act the fool he can be cut in season without taking a huge cap hit. Buffalo, im sure, have all kinds of escape clauses in the paperwork should he become a burden.... I know what you mean about being pissed he is on yer team, but maybe it works out and you get 80 catches and 1400 yards out of the guy and like 18 TDs.|`|grbicWXaaa	You should be happy.<br>  <br>  1.) He signed a 1 yr contract and the reason he did that was because he wants to spark interest from other teams that he's still good, so whenever his contract is up knowing T.O. he's going to be out of there.<br>  <br>  2.) The only reason the Bills won any games was because of Lynch(RB) and the other NFL teams realized that and were targeting him.<br>  <br>  3.) T.O. isn't that bad, a cancer i know but still a really good player and hopefully he will help the Bills win some more games, because honestly no offense the Bills suck...<br>  <br>  3.) T.O. is actually good, a cancer i know, but still good.|`|bwibB9Cnaa	Just know that if he does keep his mouth shut, the AFC East is going to be a powerhouse this year. But my Pats are still going to come out on top. This will be one hell of a year in the East. Moss vs. Owens twice a year... I can't wait|`|HiMx0NkPaa	Look Guy! This is the best thing to happen to that franchise within the past 10-15 years. What are you stupid? You like being 9-7 every year???<br>  At least now yall have someone that can raise ticket sales and show an all out I want to win or go home attitude.|`|belRa3tBaa	Don't worry, the first year or two should be fine...but after that it will probably go down hill. Hate to be the bearer of bad news but the last 6 years have taught us that T.O can't stay in one locker room forever.|`|PuxP6UzVaa	More money in Terrell Owens wallet and more fans in Buffalo will pay more attention to the team.  Look on the bright side at least Buffalo hasn't signed Gus Frerotte .|`|G8hNjEF0aa	lol wow i never thought T.O. would be denied  by almost every team. <br>  I still think he's good is just that he's too selfish.|`|N3LVlVmnaa	I'm acually sorta KINDA HAPPY !<br>  the bills are gonna do a lot better<br>  <br>  Go billllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllss...|`|8pS0oT4faa	haha good luck to you!|`|NGOa1UPyaa	hes bad, but not tht bad|`|fiaFQAWWaa	That sucks! My cousin played for the Bills. I'm sure he's pissed.|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	Look this is very simple to answer. TO is going to hit every major NFL receiving milestone in a Buffalo Bills Jersey. You realize how much publicity will be given just by him having mild stats this year. I mean he can hit 1000 receptions, 15000 yards and 150 TD's all this year. I mean the only reason barry bonds stayed with san fran was so they would have him in a giants jersey everytime they how him breaking the all time home run record. I think that this is the ONLY reason for the Bills to do this deal.|`|iWaU76T5aa	He may do some contribution to the Bills, now you guys can draft an offensive line. I wanted T.O to be a Patriot.|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	How is this a bad move for Buffalo when now it frees up your best player in Marshawn Lynch?  Running is what wins you games in the NFL.  Teams wont be stacking the box.  Does anyone seriusly know anything about the NFL in here?  Anyway now you will understand he will get blamed for everything and ESPN will blow it up out of proportion.  You can only understand it if he is on your team and you follow the team closely.  You wont be sorry he plays for the Bills.  I think its a smart move.  Were there any Bills WRs with 10 tds last year?  The Niners werent better when they released him, neither were the Eagles.  It remains to be seen what Dallas will do.<br>  <br>  <br>  What did T Owens do wrong in Dallas.  Please pick one and tell me.  Also, is Demarcus Ware lieing to everyone in this video?  Let me know if he is lieng so we can start the Demarcus Ware is a team cancer rumor too.  It starts at 3:30.  I think its hilarious that people on YA know more about Terrel  Owens then Demarcus Ware ha.   True NFL fans only come to YA!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nfl.com/videos?videoId=09000d5d80e954aa" rel="nofollow">http://www.nfl.com/videos?videoId=09000d...</a>|`|rNUyV1EYaa	Don't panic...yet.<br>  <br>  The Bills signed T.O. for one year; that's all. It took him over two years to start his crap in Dallas.<br>  <br>  Plus, he'll play good soldier for a year now to try to up his free agent value to some other sucker...I mean, team in 2010.|`|ubGNtkHQaa	Haha, TO is going to get eaten up by the defensive masterminds of Rex Ryan, and Bill Belichek|`|7RziqsDcaa	Well, I hate to tell ya man, but I think he will actually help the Bills lol.|`|7B9KEqCnaa	I think bills got a good deal.  they only signed him for one year. so its not like they are investing in TO.  Its gonna bring them some media spotlight and sell some seats.  and TO should be on good behavior because he knows if he destros this team and acts up this year, no team is gonna want him next year,forcing him to retire.  I dont think TO will be a a headache like everyone thinks and assumes, he's usually on good behavior the first year with a team cause he wants to go out there and prove to everyone that he is not the bad person is is being made out to be.  He'll behave, besides what to the bills have to lose, its not like they are going anywhere with or without him.|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	I'm comforted by the fact that it's a 1-year deal. An Owens/Evans tandem could be very scary for defences and if he mouths off, well its only one season and as a Bills fan, I'm conditioned to missing the playoffs.<br>  <br>  Not 100% thrilled but it should improve the team.|`|KoABoyvWaa	T.O is not as bad as every says. I think he has a bad rap. He is talented and passionate and occasionally says the wrong thing. He isn't a cancer.|`|l3ZUVqB7aa	Ya he is what I call a crybaby who only cares about himself.<br>  <br>  I would rather have this guy as a teammate<br>  <br>  Warning steroid user<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_Qgw3YSNtg&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_Qgw3YSN...</a>|`|LvLtAOBFaa	im not a t.o fan but i think coming to buffalo is an upgrade from our previous years with out a playoff appearance at least for one year ralph wilson is considerate enough to give us hope.|`|cdQryr7paa	I know what you mean.<br>  He will be screaming at Trent Edwards on the sideline just like he used to do to McNabb.<br>  Good luck, lol.|`|LpR9sLSlaa	Any bets on where he lands in 2010?|`|1i9mrq5Yaa	lol<br>  haha<br>  there still gonna suck man<br>  bad move very bad move by the bills

dcNT65mTaa	They are missing a true center but they have a good thing going with their young core. Krstic has been playing good and mixing in with Durrant and company. They need more experience, to STOP drafting centers, and to get a good solid defender in the paint (which is why they traded for TC)|`|yO4vhNM9aa	yeah, kevin durant is the beast|`|7bx2XQlqaa	i would have traded green, but not westbrook.  Westbrook is the truth, a franchise pg who doesn't come around often.  Lopez is more valuable than Green tho.  Yes, they definetely need a true center sometime in the near future.  Maybe Thabeet.  he would be a great pickup for them if they could get him in this years draft.|`|i2NFartOaa	No trying trade Nick Collison and and bench warmer for him the tank some games and get number one overall pick Blake Griffn and be unstoppable that potienal title in four years
yt05KPhBaa	The Warriors don't focus on defense. The Celtics (especially KG) do.|`|n0v7LP39aa	I really don't know. Marco Belinelli who is also on the Warriors couldn't play any defense last year and now he is one of our better defenders. Ellis either doesn't want to play defense, or doesn't have the mind set to learn.

Trust me I have rocknrons and they are the best bearings around...|`|leTVY95Aaa	i dont know why you dont want reds. they arent bad bearings. bones swiss are the best besides the ceramics so get those|`|l3HsU1vNaa	yeah i used to get reds but they rust so easily.get SWISS. i am tellin you man, they are the fastest and rust resistant bearings ever. but, they cost 50$. hope i helped
tzrLDbHWaa	Thats technically not true.  While you can't go straight from high school to NBA anymore, the rules say nothing about college.  All it says is that you have to be at least 19 years old and be 1 year removed from high school.  <br>  <br>  Most people will just go to college, but like last year Brandon Jennings didn't want to go to college, so he signed a 1 year contract with a team in Italy so he could get paid and will enter the draft this year.  He's still projected as a lottery pick, but I can't really see how seeing as he's playing against lesser competition in Europe and he's averaging 6.5ppg 2 assits and 2 boards as a point guard, and 60% free throws and 15% 3s.  Someone like him would have been better off in college I think.<br>  <br>  One other option is to go to the D-League.  Granted, NBA D-League is kinda like a minor league, but they allow entry at 18.|`|yt05KPhBaa	You have to be 19 by the time the season starts to declare for the draft. You don't necessarily have to have spent a year in college.|`|RXgYPgo9aa	rules changed.  its one year may be changed to two soon.  look on NCAA website for answers.|`|h5OfQye0aa	You must 1st graduate out of high school now.so its not at a high school age.|`|7w8IMbwdaa	senior or junior<br>  <br>  <br>  depends on age|`|yO4vhNM9aa	yeah u cant go strait from high school anymore, it is the rule

LIKkt8djaa	Weight has more to do with the size of the board then how tall you are. You could use the 156, But if you're mainly looking for a jib board you may want to go smaller, 154 could do, and depending if you like short decks for park or not with your weight you could hit as low as 150, But that's real short. Would make a true jibstick though :). <br>  <br>  Also just to note if you decide to pick a real short deck make sure the waist widths fit your size feet.|`|iT5vnplHaa	i ride a 154 rome machine and i do jumps and jibbing. im 6 foot and weigh 130 and my board keeps me quite stable over 30 foot kickers and especially on rails. a 156 would b beast for u|`|H46AeDNPaa	for park i ride a lib-tech box scratcher 145 and im 6 foot 135 lbs. the smaller board the easier it is to spin it around and easier it is to flex it.|`|el007rWxaa	im 6' 1 and ride a 152 you can easilly go down

iRg1vyHcaa	It depends what you want. If you want glory and success then it's a straight choice between Chelsea and Man Utd. Liverpool are always there or there abouts but in recent years have lacked the stamina to stay with the big boys long term. Arsenal have been successful in recent years based on a policy of buying Europes best young players with the hope that they develop but their lack of finance is coming into play now and they are falling behind. Manchester City are up and coming but only because they have unlimited funds and are trying to buy the worlds best players. At present they are still average. As for the previous guy saying Everton will win the Premier League within 5 years he clearly hasn't watched football. Everton are a mid-table team and I would be very surprised if they finished higher than 5th in the next 10 years.<br>  <br>  I would say go for someone other than the big boys Arsenal, Man Utd, Chelsea, Liverpool and Man City.<br>  <br>  I'm a Middlesbrough fan. An established Premier League club from a town of only 120,000 population. We've done well thanks to a dedicated chairman (although we're struggling this year in the league) and the dedication of the supporters. We always get crowds of at least 25000 which is more than a fifth of the town's population. Go for a team like ours. Far more pain than pleasure, but that little bit of pleasure is so much greater with a smaller team. Or even try a team from lower divisions.<br>  <br>  If you want a scientific way of choosing then see which town near to you is named after a British town and see if they have a team. Or trace your roots back to somewhere in England and go for your local team.<br>  <br>  Or just see which kit looks prettiest!! You might end up wearing it one day!!!|`|aNVAUQJ3aa	Watch a few games, doesn't matter about the teams. In every game I watch as a neutral, I always find there's one team I eventuallty end up preferring over the other. Is there something about one teams' style of play you prefer over the other? Maybe you like an underdog, a battling side like Bolton, Stoke or Blackburn, or a slick passing team like Arsenal, West Ham or Aston Villa. Also, do they have any Americans in their team, or is their club affiliated with the US in any way. For example, Everton have Tim Howard, Fulham have Clint Dempsey, as well as formerly having Brian McBride and Carlos Bocanegra. Or you could follow Villa, who are owned by Randy Lerner.<br>  <br>  Also think about how often you could get to watch your team play, if you chose this team (I don't know what games Fox generally show, being a Brit)<br>  <br>  Just please don't support one of the 'big 4' teams. It will be nowhere near as fun :)<br>  <br>  Personally, I support West Ham, we play some lovely football, but are inconsistent at the best of times. I wouldn't reccoommend West Ham...|`|BPO6roTOaa	I'm an American too! I'm a West Ham supporter, and planning to go to a game sometime next year. I would suggest just doing what I did -- I just sat in front of the TV and watched a ton of games. I liked West Ham's style of play (and their jerseys, haha) and I guess it just kind of started there. I actually remember the exact day it happened, Bolton scored a stoppage time goal against them to make it 1-1 and I got all angry, which kind of signaled that I was actually rooting for a team. Now I feel like crying every time they play a game during mid-week because over there it will be 8 pm, over here it will be 2. Which means I have to go to school and miss the damn game! Argh!<br>  <br>  Have fun and welcome to the game!|`|Q8Qpi9gRaa	Tottenham. I'm not just saying this cause I am a spurs fan but it a great club to support. You go trough all the emotions being a spurs fan. And if your a proper fan no matter how bad they do or how much they Hurt you u will not get away from them they just stick to you. Pointless being a united fan cause you don't get all the emotions of a proper fan. If you support spurs you will be glued to them forever. I'm only 15 and have had me heart broken so many times but I just can't  get enough of them. They also play beautiful football. Trust me support spurs and go trough all emotions possible its great. You won't regret it trust me. Oh when the spurs go marching on oh when the spurs go marching on I wanna be in that number oh wen the spurs go marching on.COYS(come on you SPURS). Edit: I'm also sure that fox shows nearly every spurs game because I allways watch it online and it's from foxsport. We also have 1 of the best fans and loudest I'n Europe. Tottenham Till I Die!|`|f8zDso3uaa	I personally support arsenal just cause that's where I'm from, but I don't think Y!A is the best way to choose.  Just keep watching and pretty soon a team will do something that makes you pay a little more attention.  But if you are really stuck then maybe just go with the team that wears you favorite color :)|`|iS5LwpY5aa	Whatever you do don't root for a "Big 4" team. Some suggestions would be Everton, Fulham, Tottenham, or West Ham. Their fan bases are incredibly loyal, and you'll never be mistaken for being a glory hunter.|`|Lca1UtAyaa	Are there any paticular players you like?

As an American you'd have no reason to adopt the mindless fanaticism some 'supporters' display in their excessive exuberance - making enemies of rivals  For us it's the football that counts above all else - and we accept the twin imposters of triumph and defeat with a philosophical shrug of the shoulders.  (Check out our anthem - I'm forever blowing bubbles).<br>  It's not a rich club but it has fine traditions.  Only time England ever won the World Cup, in 1966, 3 of our boys were the backbone of the team and many Premiership sides now have ex-WHU players still doing very well. Sadly we can help develop some of the finest players but struggle to hold them, up against the fat cats.  Mais c'est la vie - we've managed to climb back from a poor 08/09 season and if we can hold on to Zola - and get some cash from the troubled Icelandic owners - we could do well next year.<br>  A team like West Ham can have a big effect on the allocation of glittering prizes - springing 'surprise' results on the big boys - but whatever, always good to watch.<br>  Enjoy your football.|`|96e3aa0cb1e4c4ec1e3d9d8ecff90f48aa	your friend is a good one a toffee fan that is the nickname for Everton  we are the oldest club in Liverpool and we have a great history , i must admit though that liverpool have had more success than  we have recently , we are known as the peoples club , we never abuse another team but we have good banter at the start of each game at Goodison we throw toffees at the fans this is a ritual and the girls dress up as they would have done in the 1800's when the first team was formed actually it was 1878 , we are now becoming a strong force in the top flight of English football and i can see us winning the premiership in the next 5 years , i do hope this helps you in making the right decision and choosing Everton as your main club , but if not good luck to you|`|STLnjU7Raa	Well if you have a loyal Everton fan you shouldn be a Liverpool fan.<br>  <br>  If your into the big 4 then Man Utd should be great for you<br>  <br>  Or of your into the smaller teams in the premier league then i reccomend everton they havent got the funds that liverpool chelsea and man utd have and still peform great so yeh its up to u|`|kxMQXhuAaa	If your friend supports Everton then you should choose their local rivals Liverpool FC.Not that i'm biased or anything,lol.|`|NmSSKnnWaa	dont just be a glory hunter supporter.<br>  follow an up and coming club with a history of disappointing fans<br>  <br>  the super roller coaster ride that is manchester city..)|`|irljnVkAaa	As an American, it probably makes sense to choose a Premiership team, I don't think you would be able to see matches from the lower divisions very often. I you were to pick a non Premiership side, I would suggest Plymouth Argyle. Plymouth was were the Mayflower left England with the Pilgrim fathers onboard. Plymouth Argyle has the Mayflower on its crest and its nickname is the Pilgrims. They are in the Championship, the league below the Premiership. We have some of the best supporters in the country, especially away from home. Plymouth Argyle are the most Westerly club in the league and are one of only two teams to wear green. Have a look at the websites in the sources part and perhaps have Argyle as a second team.<br>  <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/search/plymouth+argyle/video/x7x56w_arsenal-v-plymouth-argyle-030109-it_sport" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailymotion.com/search/plymou...</a><br>  This video is highlights of our FA cup game against Arsenal.

90c1c20841cf7509e708485e190f2851aa	Do you know what kind of fish you're seeing? "A lure I bought in sports authority" doesn't really narrow down what you're using for us, but a lot of our lakes here in Florida have grass carp and other fish that won't take lures, not to mention, as someone else already pointed out, you may be using too large of a hook, your presentation could be wrong, and the fish that are there may just be so used to being fished for that they've gotten smart and won't take a lure that they've seen before.<br>  <br>  Another question to ask yourself is if you've seen anyone else catching fish in the area. If you have, you could always strike up a conversation with someone who's actually having some luck and ask what you're doing wrong.<br>  <br>  Another thing I'd suggest is to not buy fishing equipment at chain stores. What's that kid behind the counter do in his spare time? He plays video games, he doesn't go out and fish. Buy fishing equipment somewhere where the employees actually fish, this way you can ask them how well various products work, and also what's eating what where. Yes, lures will cost a bit more at a Mom-n-Pop bait shop, but it's worth it. We need to be supporting the little guys anyway with the economy doing what it's doing.<br>  <br>  Cheap and bass boat shouldn't really be used in the same sentence, a little jon boat should do fine, or you could even go with a kayak (they can be rigged out for fishing) so you don't even have to worry about a motor (watch your weather conditions closely, though).|`|AA10276489	The thing is what are you doing. Just "going and fishing off a dock" don't say much. What bait or lure or how are you fishing and what with ?|`|NN4eLKEXaa	Are you using live bait or lures. If lures it could be your presentation if live bait is could be the bait is not appealing to the fish you see. I don't think anyone could really tell you what you are doing wrong without being there with you. I am not the greatest fisherman but I had the same problem and for me one of my problems was I was fishing for Bluegill and other sunfish and using a large hook. I went down to small hooks and can catch these now. I also increased my fish catch when I got a subscription to Fishing Facts Magazine. That is the only magazine I know that actually teaches you to fish.<br>  <br>  A cheap boat would be a small 10 foot Jon boat with a 2 horse motor. the little bass busters are good but in my opinion not very cheap. I use a float tube myself. It gets me to where the fish are and is not as expensive as a boat.

jSkHquK5aa	Soccer heading is a skill that shouldnt be ignore. Soccer players should spend a certain amount of time practicing this. Soccer is a game often played along the ground but sometimes a high ball is the option that some players might choose. Once the ball is in the air, both teams will want to challenge for it. If you wait for the ball to drop, you run the risk of losing possession, or even maybe conceding a goal. Heading is a skill that can win and lose games. A defensive header should be used to clear high balls from crosses or corners. <br>  <br>  Heading doesn't come naturally, it takes practice just like any other skill. Most people, including myself, go into self-preservation made when we see an object hurling towards our faces. This defensive reaction causes us to close our eyes and turn away - the very things you shouldn't do!<br>  <br>  There are 4 main points to keep in mind when heading the ball:<br>  <br>  Use the forehead. This is a relatively flat surface and will make controlling the direction of the header easier. The skull is also thickest here. Even a ball coming at pace will not hurt. Finally, because the ball will be coming towards your forehead, you will be able to watch the ball right upto the moment of impact. <br>  <br>  Try not to head the ball with the very top of your head. This can be very painful and cause you to be dazed.<br>  <br>  Keep your eyes open. Many still photographes show that even the professionals close their eyes at the precise moment of contact between ball and head. This is quiet normal. Try to keep your eyes on the ball for as long as possible. <br>  <br>  Attack the ball. Meet the ball, dont just let the ball hit you. if you wait for the ball to come to you, it is likely that it wil be intercepted. Be positive and don't be scared of the ball. <br>  <br>  Arch your back and nob our head. Most of the times, you will want to try and get maximum power into a header. By arching your back and snapping forward at the point of contact, you will give your head forward momentum when it meets the ball. Even more power is ger=nerated if you use your neck mosucles to punch through the ball at the same time. <br>  <br>  Try to keep in mind all these 4 points when heading a ball. It is best to have someone throw you the ball lightly and practice heading the ball at a slow pace. Then gradually as you get better, add more pace. When you think you are ready, practice heading for goal . It is harder to head a ball when there are defenders in the box.<br>  <br>  You should challenge for the ball when you feel confident of winning it. Keep your eye on the ball and try not to focus on any feints or dummies that your opponent might throw at you. You can also try feints to tackle, force the error or opening you are looking for. <br>  <br>  <br>  Remember, when the opposition are in possession of the ball, everyone has to defend. strikers can be regarded as the front line of defence. They should be the first to put pressure on the opponents. Strikers most likely wont win the ball against 4 defenders but tehy can cut down thinking time and force them to hurry them into making a mistake. Always stay goalside of your opponent. Defenders must always try to keep pressure on the opponents and win possesion back and minimise threat levels. Stay close to the person you are marking so when they receive the ball, they'll be under pressure right away and have more of a chance of making a mistake. <br>  <br>  Challenge the opponent using the Block Tackle to win the ball and keep pressure on the attacker. <br>  <br>  Interceptions. Be alert for under-hit balls or misdirected pass. If you can steal the ball before it reaches the intended receiver, you wont have to tackle him.<br>  <br>  Jockey and be patient. Even if the attacker is able to turn successfully, the pressure is still on him. The longer he retains possession, the more likely he is going to make a mistake. Try to force you opponent into less dangerous areas to prevent them from having a decent shot on goal. <br>  <br>  If things get desperate, use the Slide Tackle to knock the ball from under the attackers feet or even win the ball. <br>  <br>  Do not rush things on jump straight in. Bide your time and wait for on opening. Stay ready and keep your eye on the ball at all times.|`|nJ5kceMBaa	My most basic of tips, but also one of the most important, would be to always be decisive. Be confident in every decision you make and never do things half-heartedly. And since you're only just starting competitive football, you're going to make lots of mistakes. Don't let this knock you, because you're still learning at this stage and you can't expect to be fantastic straight away.<br>  <br>  Good luck =)|`|YJcd8OAeaa	pressure the opponent, dont worry, and good luck|`|wOIdAmngaa	Well, I'm a defender on my travel soccer team and all I have to tell you is attack attack attack attack! Also you may want to consider asking your coach for a few tips, I'm sure he/she will help you. Also there is a stance you should be in. My coaches call it surfing. What you do is have one leg forward and one back, kinda like your surfing! You do that people can't nutmeg you! <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If you want to be a goalie you have to have GREAT reflexes and be light on your feet. <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!!

You have players from different eras.  With rule changes that would be a nightmare.  Especially If they have to play, say, the 1958 Colts using 1958 rules.  (Moss, and Rice would never get of the line of scrimmage - no PI or holding if no pass was in air.  Favre- a defender can actually hit the QB in 1976 after three steps that was a new rule then.  In 1958 it would be open season on him until the play is over, whether he threw the ball or not.)|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	QB- John Elway<br>  HB- Marshall Faulk<br>  FB- Daryl Johnston<br>  WR- Cris Carter<br>  WR- Jerry Rice<br>  TE- Tony Gonzalez|`|dnwJmNkdaa	QB - Dan Marino<br>  HB - Otis Andersen<br>  FB - Jerome Bettis<br>  WR- Cris Carter<br>  WR-Art Monk <br>  TE- Shannon Sharpe|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Same as yours, except 2 slots...<br>  <br>  QB-Joe Montana<br>  HB-Walter Payton
3JKYryYyaa	You should do it like you're in basic training (ARMY, etc)..<br>  <br>  ...run every day, every chance you get, and eventually (after a week or two) the pain will go away and you will be "in the zone".  When two months are up, the miles will probably be closer to 5.5 min miles, and you will have your 11 min, 2 miles.<br>  <br>  also, diet has a lot to do with performance.

xOReEw6Waa	Lot of BLM land west of Spokane, near Edwall,Davenport, Reardon. Most people with enough land will welcome coyote hunters if you ask and are respectful to the landowners wishes. There are a lot of options I'm going to be looking at south of Spokane in the Palouse country, Garfield, Steptoe, St. Johns, etc. Should find lots of land around Moses Hole too. Western Wa, not so sure about, but I can imagine areas around Wanatchee and the Tri-Cities would be open.|`|Q4NFFBizaa	Eastern Wa, outside of spkane there is a place called Medical Lake and I hear they get a good amount of 'Yotes this time of year!

gN5Onyeiaa	100% Yes.<br>  <br>  Lackey is undervalued, Haren is as consistent as any fantasy pitcher, and Howard is HUGE liability in AVG. <br>  <br>  Votto and Davis are both underrated. Votto has a good shot at 20/20 this year, and Davis could easily hit 35 homers (he hit 17 in 295 ABs as a rookie last year).<br>  <br>  Either one could easily replace Howard. No brainer. Pull the trigger.|`|ifiukIvDaa	NO!!!   If you have a strong rotation.<br>  YES!!! if not.<br>  There are few first basemen other than Pujols and Teixera that put up the kind of numbers Howard does.<br>  In addition, if he keeps up how he ended last season, he will be the best offensive player in fantasy, partly due to the sandbox he plays in.
s7f9ojYMaa	I'd recommend either of the following three options:<br>  <br>  1) BREECHES - Get a pair of breeches with the correct waist fitting.  The length is designed to be shorter and they'll go down between the knee and anksle so that shouldn't be a problem.  Just get her a pair of fancy horsey knee socks to go with them, and wear either half-chaps or long riding boots over them.<br>  <br>  If jodhpurs boots are required (e.g. for Pony Club etc), one of the following options might be better:<br>  <br>  2) DRAWSTRING WAIST JODHPURS - I've seen these manufactured by Loveson (available in the UK, not sure about other countries).  The waist can be adjusted in with the drawstring, so you'd buy a bigger size (e.g. Age 12, 24" waist, 24" inseam), and adjust the waist to fit your daughter.  Although they'll be a bigger size the material is stretchy so shouldn't be baggy. <br>  <br>  3) FITTING ELASTIC TO JODHPURS - You could try getting a cheap pair (Tesco, Argos, eBay etc) of the right leg length and fit your own elastic to them.  The elastic can be obtained from most supermarkets or any sewing / craft / hobby shop.  Its not too difficult to sew in to the waist.<br>  <br>  You could also simply get a pair with a longer leg and use a belt - most jodhpurs come with belt loops.  Almost all jodhpurs are slim fitting anyway and shouldn't baggy.<br>  <br>  I've included a link to the Loveson ones I mentioned below.  You'll also notice in the sizing, they do them in Regular and Long leg fittings.  I know a lot of other manufacturers also do this, but you'd need to contact the manufacturer or the shop directly to find out the exact leg measurements.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! :)

014d662e9ccdcc2dfcbd68b27f469d57aa	I think they have a bright future.|`|Lsb9T2KDaa	future is good because there is nowhere to go but up|`|BRX96ZUnaa	Very good future. Give them a couple of years, and they'll be the next Portland Blazers. Maybe even better if Kevin Durant keeps shining. Jeff green is a good player. He will be an all star one day, I'm sure of that. Versatile 3-4 man who can shoot the 3, while rebounding. Russel Westbrook, oh my. He is an incredible athlete, why wasn't he in the dunk contest again? He can score while distribute the ball and rebound. Give him 3 years, he will be in the top 8 PG. Everyone knows how good Kevin Durant is already. Future leading scorer, All Star next year if he keeps it up. Imagine if the Thunder got Blake Griffin in the draft, that team would be instoppable. Overall, the Thunder is a good team, just not experienced enough yet. Give them a couple of years, they'll be great.|`|21XmVm6Zaa	Their future is as bright as the sun green and westbrook are going to be great not phenomenal like durant though <br>  i still wish they wouldnt have rescinded the tyson chandler trade <br>  but in the draft i say they go ricky rubio even though they need a center....|`|EJTIHIsCaa	Anything that has to do with the  OKC Thunder is bad. Sorry!|`|ghLcOsnnaa	yea they have a bright future ahead|`|UG2VpQjaaa	Kevin "Durantula" should easily be a top 10 guy but top 5 might be a slight stretch, but then again people get injured and are never the same so that could happen to someone... He'll average 24 points, 7 rebounds, and 4 assists I think for awhile and he'll improve his shooting. Maybe if he gains a bit of weight he could move to PF position perhaps.<br>  <br>  Green has potential and will be key for the future and Westbrook has all star potential on him.<br>  <br>  The top 5 pick they'll almost certainly be getting will probably be used to get Jordan Hill who is a perfect fit since he's a big guy whose had such a breakout year.<br>  <br>  Cap Space won't be an issue definitely but who will sign with a team with such a small market, it was an issue when moving the team and it will be even more of one with signing someone who is great. I think all the Thunder really will need in 2 years though is a depth and maybe another starter who is a definite center.<br>  <br>  I think they should grab Wade though even though they don't REALLY need him... Imagine... A Westbrook/Wade tandem in the backcourt and then Durant in the front... That would be frickin' amazing... Plus Wade would then play in the Western Conference which will be aging in a few years, San Antonio is leaving title contention soon along with the Suns, the Nuggets, and the Mavericks, the Lakers would be the only contender really since they are so young besides the Blazers and the Hornets. Whereas in the East we have a rising New York team, the Cavs, Orlando, the Raptors (they'll be good soon). He'll have a better shot for a title in the long run I think.|`|W7Dr5YaEaa	good future ahead if they keep durant.

9Kt7p7Vfaa	The camber of the board is put in during the pressing process. A mold is machined to the dimensions of the ski or board but the camber tends to relax after pressing so the mold has more built in to it. AS the epoxy dries under great pressure, the board retains the shape of the mold. The tip, tail and camber usually aren't pre-bent and rely on the pressing process to bend the core.
GVuTWQ6Aaa	you need to get the correct angle files from a company like Swix or Wintersteiger, a good board shop will have them.. they will also have pocket tuners, which work, but I don't recommend them.  you will need to know the angles your board is, so you know what to cut them too... for Example, burton LTR and Cruzer boards have a 1* base angle and 3* side angle.. file from tip to tail, on the edges until they are sharp, but the practice of filing does take practice.. as hand filing is part of a race tune, most shops charge more for... after it's sharp, you want to detune it just a little with a gummy stone
QbY18bjkaa	yes it looks very likely, i heard they were still developing it should be cool tho.|`|EZf00NJJaa	I think not .
S0u3HKzhaa	Push Shelton Benjamin more.And use him more with the mic and a decent storyline that amuses the fans.And put the belt on the line more.And it more extreme type matches with different stipulations.Make the United States title actually used instead of really a crappy feud that people could careless about then just have Shelton win it and not do anything for two weeks.Start having more frequent title changes and make it exciting and with different scenarios to defend it.Make us entertained with it.Not just go to the bathroom during the match because it is the same old.Push Benjamin use him right make him in decent feuds that actually last and have more drama to them.Add a interesting twist to the feud.New opponents and challengers.That's what I would do.I actually like to see them use the title as a good mid card feud with a match at a ppv.Like really the only time it is put on the line is at Night Of Champions.<br>  <br>  I'd like to see them use M.V.P in this Chavo,Paul Burchill,Helms,Kendrick,R-Truth.Guys who we don't see enough that are good.Use them put them into exciting matches.Make us enjoy the match and not have us like didn't the same damn thing happen last week and the week before.Really just but more feuds and different matches and stuff that we haven't seen in a while.Really to get the division to be well alive again.|`|UWJinEbIaa	Defend it on PPV would be a good start.  Shelton Benjamin vs CM Punk for a #1 contender for the World Title could of semi-main Wrestlemania but as usual WWE wants to overbook everything and put 8 people in the Money-in-the-bank.....|`|oAjbBLDpaa	My opinion on how to do this is to first continue this MVP, Shelton Benjamin, and Chavo Guerrero feud. For now, with both Benjamin and MVP in the MitB, have Chavo qualify as well and have them all three stop each other from winning it with MVP finally winning it. Next, have Shelton Benjamin defend the title against MVP at Backlash after MVP wins a match for No. 1 Contendership through a count-out on a Smackdown show. Then have Shelton retain and have him, again, defend the title at Judgement day, this time against Chavo. Shelton retains once again and he finally defends against both Chavo and MVP at One Night Stand with Chavo winning and MVP disappearing from the feud as he works his way up to main event. Chavo continues the feud with Shelton and maybe use someone they drafted to add to the feud.|`|smcDn76jaa	Well obviously have way more title defenses. Also have main event stars gunning for the title whenever they aren't after the World title or WWE title. If main event stars go for the title than it makes it seem more prestigious, and it allows for some interesting feuds. Also have great matches for each of the matches. The better and harder the wrestler fight for the title the better the division.

AA11108627	IMHO, if Owens doesn't change his ways, he's not a good fit for anyone...the Bills or any other NFL team.<br>  <br>  His talent isn't the issue...it's his ego, his "all-about-me" attitude, how he fails to think as a team player.  If he's going to whine & pout about HIS stats, how he's not getting enough attention from the QB, how he's unappreciated, etc etc etc, he's going to be a negative influence on the entire team, and ultimately not worth having on the roster.<br>  <br>  I certainly appreciate the Bills and their loyal, devoted fans who have stuck with them through all those "just missed" years (I'm a Red Sox fan; I know the feeling!).  So I wish you guys well and hope T.O. is a solid addition to your line-up.  But I feel that depends on whether or not he finally learns that the purpose of a football team goes far beyond shining a brighter & brighter spotlight on him & him alone.|`|ubGNtkHQaa	Place your bets on how much games before TO gets cut.<br>  <br>  Talk about getting shut down, he will play against two defensive masterminds (Ryan, Belichek)|`|fz0Aw3hLaa	I think he will, hes got a young team, with a young QB who through for over 2,500 yards last year [despite being injuried]<br>  <br>  They also have a decent defense, and a good back in Marshawn Lynch.<br>  <br>  If they play their cards right, they could maybe be playoff contenders.<br>  <br>  They have the ability to win,<br>  remember last year? They starter the season 5-1...<br>  before going 2-8.<br>  <br>  Either way, he is a good wide reciever that has had over 1,000 yards recieving for the last 9 seasons, except for 2005 when he only played 7 games due to injury. And even then, he had over 700 recieving yards.<br>  Sure he is a loudmouth, and drops passes, but he produces on the field with yards and touchdowns.|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	The Bills needed a big WR to go with Evans and Owens fits that bill.<br>  <br>  It all hinges on TO keeping his mouth shut. It's a very conservative offence and Edwards is not a guy who'll sling the ball downfield, and I'm nervous about whether or not TO will be satisfied with this.<br>  <br>  But it's a 1-year deal and if it doesn't pan out, then whatever. A worthwhile risk IMO.<br>  <br>  Certainly didn't expect TO in Buffalo and honestly don't think it'll work but a Lynch/Evans/Owens combo at the skill positions is awesome.|`|482oQASHaa	Yes it's a great fit T.O,  does not cause problems  with his teams during the first year.  since th teams starts having problems with him after the first year  he is there.  so with this being only a 1 year deal. T.O  will try to be on his best to make everyone happy. hoping  by next year a team will sing him  to  a 2 or 3 year contract|`|tzrLDbHWaa	T.O. was great in Philly his first season, same in Dallas, he's not going to bite the hand that feeds him unless he has a nice contract already in place (or got a nice signing bonus).  He'll be fine, if anything a 1 year deal makes this a contract year, so he'll be trying his best to pump up his value for his next contract.|`|7078186576934268513c3e942623c173aa	I dont like it. Here is why...the problem with TO is he takes out his issues on the QB and do you want the possibility of TO ruining Edwards confidence? Trent had his issues with confidence last year (as you correctly noted) and TO has attacked every single QB that ever had to throw him a pass. I dont know what the Bills were thinking but this was not worth the potential risk of wrecking a young QB and needing to start over yet again.|`|vXFpzKRaaa	TO is not a good fit for the young Bills team.  Obviously the team feels this way as well since he's only signed to a 1 year deal.  They're trying to get a feel for him and for the most part TO will play nice so he'll get a longer contract but what he can't help is that he drops balls.  And we'll see balls hit the ground when Dec rolls around and the ball is cold and like a rock.|`|1NVMh8wSaa	Its a one year deal and he has to prove he can get along so I think its a good deal for the Bills who also need to sell a few more tickets. He wont be the answer to all the problems but they could finish 2nd or 3rd in the division in 09.|`|N3LVlVmnaa	HEY omg i remeber youuuuuuuuu !<br>  we used to talk [i think]then i kept getting suspended !!!!<br>  [i go to OP] Anywaysss !<br>   I AM friken happy we got him, <br>  the bills are going to do sooooo much better, no lie,<br>  we are going to the playoffs this year ! i mean he's not <br>  really a good team mate but he's going to do the bills some good!<br>  <br>  GO BiLLS !|`|8hSj5lJLaa	T.O being signed to the Bills add more depth at the WR spot and gives Edwards more options with Lee Evans Tony Parrish and now T.O|`|X6ZxYovlaa	He will probably improve their record a bit, but they'd still suck.  And late in the season, his locker room issues will be an even bigger deal.|`|yuGhmhGuaa	Great Fit!!!|`|e9065dfa2249178c642f3f273c9dbb1caa	it is a good fit because dey have a great wr tandem now with evans and owens

ZH0R7Tfaaa	well you have to found out what your foot placement is and where to put your feet comfortably. when your right foot is behind your left foot you are goofy footed. when your left foot is behind youre regular footed. now that youre standing!: push off with your backfoot on a flat piece of land. your garage will work fine. or you can stand on your board on your kitchen floor and hang to your counter for support. to turn the board you should lean your body the direction you want to turn. dont be afraid to put your hands out! and make sure to wear the right gear. at least be wearing a helmet and sneakers. thats some of the basics. its hard to explain. youtube videos are always big helpers. but dont be afraid! and good luck! and be safe! :) and have fun!|`|yqC51KXOaa	Get on the board and... and... AND... crack a bottle, let your body waddle<br>  Don’t act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto|`|ZRI6sMlaaa	Foot Placement:<br>  Right foot first - Goofy Foot (there's nothing wrong with that, it's just the name)<br>  Left Foot first - regular <br>  To Find What your stance is (Goofy or regular):<br>  Stand with your feet shoulder length apart have someone push you forward (have them push you one your back) when you go forward naturally one foot will go out to support you so that you don't fall forward. What ever foot goes out first when you are pushed is the foot that goes one the skateboard in the front when you are riding.<br>  <br>  To Move:<br>  There are two ways to push of the ground to begin moving:<br>  1) Start with the front foot on the front of the board over the bolts. If your front foot is the left foot have that foot on the bolds and the right foot on the ground to the right of your board with you facing forward. And if your front foot is the right foot have that foot on the bolts with the left foot on the left of the board with you facing forward. Use the foot that is on the ground to push the ground and get the board moving. Once moving put the foot that was used to push off the ground, on the board. Continue pushing to increase spead.<br>  2) The other way to start moving: If your front foot is the right foot you can begin with that foot on the ground and the left foot on the back bolts of the board. Or if your front foot is the left foot then you can leave that on the ground and hav the right foot on the back of the board on the bolts and push. Having the back foot on the back bolts will allow the front foot to be able to go to the front of the board after pushing off. <br>  <br>  Moving Tips:<br>  Before moving you must face the direction that you want to go. Not like a wave board where you face to the side and push your foot side ways. On a skateboard you must push the foot that is on the ground behind you.<br>  I prefer the first method of pushing off because there is more balance.<br>  When you stand on the back it is easier to fall.<br>  <br>  Turning:<br>  Once you have both feet on the board lean your body in the desired direction to turn. Your feet should be facing forward not in the directing you are moving but forwar as in the direction that you body is standing.<br>  If the parenthesis wee the tips of the board and the vertical lines are your feet this is how it should look (    I          I     )<br>  the wrong way is (    /        /    ) . So to turn lean back or forward.<br>  Sometimes holding someone helps.|`|zJlUHkP1aa	What kind of question is this. Foo, just push and go. It's self explanatory.

Got beat down, disappeared and came back with the most boring return ever, then hopped into 1 match with Abyss for the Tag Team Titles?

He has to concentrate on catching up to the other player in preparation for the season. You don't just walk on the field after being off for several month of not playing. He has work to do.|`|mH1ls32Paa	Manny is a washed up hack who wishes he could take his job back at the Red Sox. when the next few years go by he will be begging to go back their because they will be so good|`|42f3d6d73c3972f622efbb1789221c0baa	No he isn't.|`|l3ZUVqB7aa	No because he loves himself to much|`|Rz9vY53Aaa	no he is not

3rmVGqWsaa	I personally like the look of the Babolat bags better.  The light blue is my favorite but it all depends on what your looking for. Since you are a guy I bet you would like the black Babolat bags over the light blue<br>  <br>  Here are Wilson bags<br>  <a href="http://www.tennis-warehouse.com/catpage-WILSONBAGS.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tennis-warehouse.com/catpage-...</a><br>  <br>  Here are Babolat bags<br>  <a href="http://www.tennis-warehouse.com/catpage-BABBAGS.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tennis-warehouse.com/catpage-...</a><br>  <br>  Hope you pick out a good one!<br>  <br>  <br>  ~Claire~|`|lbX75d1xaa	The one that is the same brand as your racquet, obviously.  It is not supposed to be a different brand.|`|s7l6oZANaa	buy the new babolat bag its like a blue bag that andy roddick is using.. you can either have a bag that fits 3 rackets or six <br>   its looks good!|`|qd7lLILMaa	Well it depends on what racket you use too, it would loo nice if your racket matched your bag, <br>  Try a 6 pack bag<br>  <br>  Some good places to look would be<br>  www.tenniswarehouse.com    <----- i like this website<br>  www.tennisexpress.com|`|Xc16MR5Jaa	Babolat Babolat Babolat Babolat Babolat Babolat Babolat Babolat|`|hP3rJAuQaa	does it matter? <br>  whichever one you think is hotter<br>  links would be helpful|`|IrWFzPpMaa	Personally, I think Wilson bags are much more complete with the looks and the overall feel of the bags.
82LusQuKaa	I know, when I run, I am soaked from head to toe, from sweat. I keep a set of running sweats in my car, for when I get back. I also keep a towel or two. If you want a good set of sweats, then go to Nike.com. You can also check out some of your local running clubs to get some input from other local runners, who deal with the same exact conditions. P.S. I love running in the rain...adds about 3 miles to my run. Tagger
24UPDIBTaa	I wouldn't say you have much of a weakness, you just have yet to progress a lot over time. You will, you're just in the early stages at the moment. It's always nice to hear about a tight end that can block and catch too.<br>  <br>  Either your coach is doing a good job (I think he has you playing a good position for your attributes), your family has good genes, or both. If coach and brother think you could improve with lower body exercise, my instinct would lead me to believe there's some truth to it.<br>  <br>  As you age and workout, you'll likely add some weight. I recommend working on your speed, so that you'll continue to be fairly quick even when you weigh more.<br>  <br>  The link below is to a previous answer of mine with some training tips that might be of use to you.<br>  <br>  Do you play linebacker on defense? Another position that might suit you. Just wondering.<br>  <br>  You seem to have the size and athletic ability to do well in the sport. Have a good time and best of luck!|`|82Vo9DXCaa	If your brother is as good as your making out to be, I wouldn't see why you wouldn't listen to what he says. You should ask him what you should improve because he obviously knows what he's doing.|`|yQWYe14gaa	Your weakness is your height, though it's not too bad.<br>  Improve your skills.<br>  Learn your position inside and out.<br>  Make sure you know all your plays, routes, etc..<br>  Learn how to use different moves to get open, work on your catches and ball control.<br>  Make sure you know the PROPER thing to do in every situation.<br>  Sounds like you are good to go already with the stats you gave.<br>  I hate to point out the obvious, but if your brother has all these offers, he's probably your closest source of good advice.<br>  Remember, making the play is the only thing that matters.|`|belRa3tBaa	Well, my squat is 340 even though your probably a better athlete than me. I would really try and focus on your speed and catching ability. Your not very big, but spread offenses love Tight Ends that can catch and run good routes.|`|X0iFqfleaa	there are big DL in the nfl so build some muscles in your legs so you wont fall over.And just practice on catching and route running|`|Vu5flMrdaa	Stay the way you are if you are happy with your self.
