Ok, it's not quite as bad as mu-mus, but when I shop for clothes, I notice a lot of empire waists, kimono-like tops, wide-band waistlines, and babydoll-type blouses. How did these trends come back into fashion, and is there a general term for this style? I know styles are cyclical, but did a certain designer bring it back? Is it consumer demand? I'm frustrated because I'm small framed, and these styles make me look fat, pregnant and just plain sloppy. I can't find anything to flatter my body type (34-26-36, 5'3", 105 lbs.). I've been looking at NY & Company, Old Navy, TJ Maxx, Macy's, and American Eagle.  I'd like to know what you think of these styles, too. If you know of any places I should try out, I'd appreciate it (within an Old Navy price range). Or do I have to wait 10 years before I can buy clothes again??

20080818015600AAjNJGd	Beauty & Style;Hair	Hair problem, any suggestions?	I want to grow my hair out really long, like to my waist. Right now, it falls to about 3 inches past my shoulders. The problem with my hair though, is that it always grows to that length, and then stops. It's been about a year since I last cut my hair, and it still won't grow any farther than that. Are there any suggestions as to what I can do to help it grow faster? Right now, the only thing I do with my hair, is shampoo and condition with Pantene Pro-V once a day, and let it air dry. I take really hot showers, is it true that that's bad for your hair? I'm only 19, not sure if that helps at all. I very rarely straighten or blow-dry my hair, and I never use hairspray or other hair products. I've dyed my hair maybe 4-5 times, is it possible that that could have caused damage that could make it stop growing like that? Should I be using a different brand/type of shampoo and conditioner? Any tips or suggestions as to what I can do to make my hair grow faster would be appreciated. :)

And in personality too: I have given up my virginity several times since I was 13 (I'm not proud of it) my 13-year-old sister Roxy has gotten expelled and smokes/drinks/does drugs frequently, my 10-year-old sister Becca is an environmentalist and a tree-hugger but she is not popular at all and has been known to be booed at rallies. And Leanne is in kindergarten, is stupid, pudgy, and babyish. Emma Rose is a perfect little angel, adored by all, skipped a grade, and is on an advanced dance/acrobatics team.

20090220010606AAAMHjM	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	How to voice that I am upset without becoming a raging lunatic or a pushover?	I just went to abercombie and bought some clothes. I bought two pairs of jeans, one was full price and the other was clearance. Everything was paid for and I went on my merry way. Well the next day I happened to look at the receipt, and saw that I was charged full price for the clearance jeans. I am very upset since that is a $50 difference, the tag was clearly marked, and it was the store manager that checked me out, plus my husband tried to return a pair of jeans he bought a year ago because they ripped at the back pocket (Abercrombie will replace jeans that tear at the seams or pockets, as it is a quality issue), the store manager was really rude and said they won't replace them since they don't sell them anymore. But anyways, I don't complain AT ALL, so I am unsure how to go about this. Any pointers on what I should say when I call them? I'm the kind of person who orders a large fry and gets a small, and won't say anything because it's only like a dollar, but this is $50...so I can't just let this one go, but am unsure how to go about this.

20090203121104AAohrJi	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Hmm...What you think?	Well today I was in class and my teacher asked the class a question about african americans that really got me to thinking ya know? Well she asked us if we thought that the lighter a person is the prettier they are. Some people said yes while others said no. One girl said she agreed because lighter skin people usually had prettier hair and eyes which made them pretty. She also said that most black boys talk said about wanting lighter skinned girls than darker skinned. Another girl she disagreed because just because you are lighter doesn't necessarily mean that you're prettier than anyone else. So what do I think? Well I think that on earth there will be attractive people and less attractive people. However, I don't believe the color of a person's skin will make them more attractive than another person. And about the girl saying that lighter skinned people had prettier hair and eyes that's completely untrue. For one, I'm not light skinned and I do have long pretty hair. Usually longer than light skinned girls hair. And two, I have pretty eyes as well. So that throws that logic straight out the window. But enough of me typing I want to know what do you all think about this question. Be honest as well. :)

I was told that if I add the zodiac cancer tattoo under the love Japanese symbol it will change the meanings of both the tattoos because of the way Japanese is read.

The Love tattoo is on top and the zodiac cancer would be below it, in a vertical line.

I DON'T want a tattoo. It scares me. Yesterday i got the outline partially done. It's on my hip and about 2X2 inches. I'm supposed to get color tomorrow but I just want it gone, It looks tacky. AND I DON'T LIKE IT. BTW i don't think i mentioned I'm only 17 and If I told my parents they'll flip but they would most likely pay for removal. I don't want to like BETRAY my boyfriend because he was way excited about it. But, it doesn't feel right and it makes me queasy. Like I feel all icky. I WANT IT OFF NOW. Would Laser be the best way? Would it erase the small simple black line? Or would creams do anything? it's seriously just a really small outline of a dove. PLEASE HELP. I don't think I'm emotionally ready for a tattoo. Please HELP. whats the best way to get this done??

Btw, before anyone tells me that my tan will go away in the Winter time, that's not true. My arms have always remained tanned.      I come from Mediterranean Europe, so my skin is naturally adjustive to tans. So I know it'll stay like that for a long time!

And I pluck at it every night for about 1.5 hrs because otherwise, it'll show.    When I look at my face in the sunlight, it looks really strange. I can't explain it really but it's very dotty and the colour is uneven. I've been using Sudahah Creamy Compact make up and it doesn't really work that well. What should I use? Would concealer be more helpful? Will it form a layer over my skin? Please, please help me. Thanks! xxx

IF anyone could provide me with any info to a coat that looks exact or VERY similar to this one it'd be a wondrous help. If you could also mention the brand or a shop where you could get one that would be so great (eg. Myers, Target, David Jones). thanks for your time people, any info greatly appreciated! =)
20090220032045AAu4pwP	Beauty & Style;Hair	Is it proper for a man to ask his hair stylist out?	I I have been getting my hair cut by a girl for around a year. I really would like to go on a date with her. Is it ok to eventually ask her out. Is there a unwritten law to not date or be interested in a client?
