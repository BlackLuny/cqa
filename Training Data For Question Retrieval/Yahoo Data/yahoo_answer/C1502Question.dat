20090305084711AA09b4l	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	How can we get past the race issue?	I have been reading a few questions posted by minorities discussing race. Pertaining to white people always being the bad guys.So I ask minorities this. How can we get past the race issue? I am a 32 year old "white woman" I hate to have to color myself because to me it doesn't make a difference.(to me) I realize there are alot of prejudice people but they do come from every race. When I was a teenager I was at a function and in the lobby there were some "black kids" dancing me and my friends watched because it was so cool how they could move we were really enjoying it. We never said anything but they started calling us down as if we were attacking them. Preconcived notions in their minds that they grew up with automatically made us bad people. But were not all bad, The way I look at it is that I am not prejudice to any group because of their color, or nationality but do hold some anamosity towards certain black people for judging me prior to even knowing me, natives who choose to take advantage of the sysem, and even white people who abuse the system, and people who come from other countries who want laws changed to suit there beliefs even though they chose to move here. But those anamosities are only to do with how they act as people. I have friends of every race and nationality, but just because I'm white I am automatically persecuted in the eyes of minorites. We don't all fall into the same boat just the same as other races there are bad and good apples and I wish we could all realize that, But due to the response I have gotten from some minority groups I would not feel safe going into certain places and that is sad. I think as PEOPLE we have to learn to judge people as individuals and not as a group or race. I know this must sound like a pile of **** to some of you coming from a white person, so only serious answers please I am being sincere.

S’il recevait une contravention, il pleurerait beaucoup.    S’il il pleurait, le flic partirait le pauvre.   S’il le flic partait, il fuirait vite.   S’il fuyait, il aurait un pneu à plat.    S’il avait un pneu à plat, il pousserait sa voiture à la station service.   S’il poussait sa voiture, il retirerait la roue de secours.   S’il retirait la roue de secours, le pompiste réparerait le pneu.   Si le pompiste réparait le pneu, le panda mettrait le contact encore !   S’il mettait le contact, la voiture tomberait en panne !   Si la voiture tombait en panne, le pompiste ferait le plein.   Si le pompiste faisait le plein, le panda fuirait encore à 120 km !   S’il accélérait trop vite, il aurait un accident de voiture dans l’h?pital.   S’il avait un accident de voiture dans l’h?pital, le médecine examinerait le panda.

20090305052117AAcbIU5	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	The Bachelor and gay marriage?	Let me start this by saying that I'm planning my wedding right now. Even though it is stressful I love it. I'll never be engaged again and I'll never plan my first wedding again and I think anyone who wants to get married should get to experience this joy!      So with that said.. let me get this straight...    it's ok to ruin the "Sanctity of Marriage" as long as major television networks are making of money off of it (ie: The Bachelor(ette), Married by America, Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire, The Littlest Groom, My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiancé, Farmer Wants a Wife, the list goes on and on.) but if two people are genuinely truly deeply in love then it's an abomination, all because they are the same sex..       What must people in outside countries, think of us?    Why do Americans think that they have the right to control how people live, just because they don't believe in it?    Why is this called the land of opportunities if you don't even have the opportunity to marry who you love?      I strongly believe that if there can be a ban on gay marriage then there should also be a ban on any reality show about marriage.. because after all if the big argument is keeping marriage sacred.. then that's just what we should do.. I would have more respect for my fellow Americans (the ones who believe differently than I) if this were the case!      wrong is wrong.. right?

My partner is not 100% ready and not sure if he wants to have kids, but I am as I'm 31 and don't want to leave it too late.  My first question is 1: If I leave my partner to have children, would you, a gay male, date a man with kids if you found me attractive?  Shallow I know, but the thought of dying without a life partner does concern me to an extent! Question 2:: Am I being selfish towards my partner and should I give up my dream of having kids because he doesn't??  Honesty appreciated.      BEFORE YOU ANSWER, DON'T TURN THIS INTO A RELIGIOUS THING FOR ALL YOU RELIGIOUS FOLKS OUT THERE.  Peace and thanks, Cody.

Beautiful thoughts       Don’t feel desperate if obstructed   Or fall down in a hall … you’ll find your way out, and you will be more powerful      Don’t be sad if the closest person hit you with an arrow … you’ll find   Who will take it off and give you back your happy life and your smile       Don’t put all your dreams and hopes in one person   And don’t make the destination of your life trip a person you love , no matter how much you love him or how much good characteristic he has    And don’t believe that the end of things is the end of the world, the world is not only what you can see.      Don’t wait a dear person if deserted you   But wait for a new light that may sneak to your sad heart and give your days a cheer and your heat a sweet beat                Don’t look for a dream that let you down and try to make the breakdown a start for a new dream    Don’t stand too much near the ruins especially if bats are there and spirits knows the way to that place    And look for a bird sound that sneaks from behind the horizon with a new daylight               Don’t look to the pages that turned pale and lost its letters   And its lines lost between pain and gloominess   You will discover that these lines is not the most beautiful thing you wrote    You need to differentiate (between) those who but your words in their eyes and those who throw it to the wind   These lines was not accidental but a heart felling that he live letter by letter                    Don’t be like the heron, that weird bird, who sing his best tunes while bleeding   Nothing in this life deserves a drop of your blood           If winter close you doors   And the snow banks surround you everywhere   Wait for the spring and open your windows for the fresh air    And look far, you will see bird flocks coming back while singing    And you will see the sun lies its golden beams on the trees   To make a new life, a new dream, and a new heart

20090305073504AA7WV7c	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Fellow Atheists; should we re-evaluate our beliefs?	I believe that mainstream Atheism is based on the Christian, Jewish and Islamic definitions of deity. There is so much evidence against the Biblical, Qu'ranic narratives of Yahweh/Allah that it is impossible for the logical mind to believe that a deity is fathomable. The three major religions of the world all come from the belief in the OT, evidence that the OT has its foundations in Ancient Egyptian Mythology is substantial, thus we conclude, through reason, that God does not exist.       But we cannot prove that an Eternal Being outside of the Biblical Narrative ( and God) does not exist, thus don't we have to re-evaluate our denomination as Atheists?       Outside of the biblical God (which can be disproved) can we say without doubt that no Eternal being exists outside of our knowledge or perception?      I hope with this question we can put an end to Christian ignorance toward our beliefs, for many times we have been accused of being a  faith, but this is based on the fact that we cannot prove Yahweh's existence. This is not true, I think we can disprove the bible which is the only evidence that Yahweh exists, but we need to admit that our belief in no Eternal beings is based on faith, then hopefully we can then be better understood and not just perceived as being arrogant.

20090305073548AAr2VA6	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is there a difference between "letting go" and "forgiving," in your opinion?	i had a discussion with my sister about this...she was uncomfortable using the word "forgive," saying she preferred to "let go."  i have since had some clarity.  i see forgiveness as "embracing," while letting go "severs," almost as though the letting go does not go far enough, but gives validity to something by denying it.  Forgiveness, on the other hand, removes the distance through seeing all as one, the other as self.  In this sense, forgiveness recognizes, ironically, that there was nothing (no thing) to forgive in the first place because there is no separation in Reality.  i and the murderer are one, i and the biting dog are one, i and my supposed enemy are one.      To use the biting dog as an analogy, if i untie the dog and shoo it on its way, the connection is broken.  But if i untie the dog and befriend it, my spirit is recognizing and embracing its spirit.  While doing this with a murderer might seem another thing altogether, it is not.  There is no specialness in the Mind of God/Source/All That Is.  i and my brother are one, and when i forgive the other i am really forgiving myself for allowing the "illusion" of separation.  After all, perhaps the dog bites and the murderer murders because i have originally seen myself as special, different, above, better than, etc.,  and, therefore, i have broken the Truth of our original, eternal connection that is our shared nature.        i'd like to hear your experiences and comments. Can you take this further than i was able to do...Thank you, "one and all."

Most if not all of my family is a die-hard nationalist that fully supports almost anything their home country says and does, and fully supports the politicians involved, even if they're corrupt.       I basically did the ultimate sin, which was, not only did I totally forget and not care about my home country when I moved here, but I also started assimilating into different groups and cultures, and even changed my name completely.      I basically re-created my life the way I wanted it, ...and my family is basically stunned and freaked out.         I tell them, f8ck countries, f8ck wars, f8ck it all. I don't care.      I'll do whatever I want, when I want, with whom i want.      this seems to piss people off.      why? It's no different than what John lennon said.      I believe he was shot and k9lled, no?            So why all the hate against people who have freedom mindsets, and all the support and love for nationalism and country-pride and all of that?   2 days ago - 2 days left to answer.    Additional Details   It's basically small minded and saying "f8ck freedom. Freedom is bad,...you need to support where you came from and your own home country, and if you're going to make it in another country, you should bring pride to your own country, and make it like.....wow look at us, people from another country made it here, who hoooo."

20090305064203AAqKGxM	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, is there a verse in the Bible that still shocks you after...?	reading it or hearing it many times?      For me, it's John 21:25, "And there are also many other things which Jesus did. If they should be all recorded one by one [in detail], I suppose that even the world itself could not contain (have room for) the books that would be written." (Amplified)      What about you? Do you have a verse that really "floors" you every time you read it or hear it?
20090227042515AAAAKLi	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Proof of how some religions are all about gaining - as seen on Oprah......?	In a part of India, it is demanded that all women must keep their heads shaved as part of their religion. What happens the hair? It is cleaned and loaded into packages to be sold to the US and many other countries to be used as hair extensions in salons. Do you think the people whos heads have been shaved see a penny of this money? No, it goes straight into the pockets of the religious organisation - and we're talking millions here -  and those people will still be living in poverty forever. Some religions will always be corrupt, theres the proof.
20090305064952AAeXHDt	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Of all these 2012 scenarios, which is most probable to happen?	A) Nibiru, a comet that will supposedly strike earth.   b) The Revelations enact.   c) zombie apocalypse as a result of a mutation of a common virus.   d) biological outbreak   e) Global War.   f)Mayan Calendar prediction causes human society to collapse spontaneously.   g) Nothing   h) Doomsday preachers going insane trying to appease the prophecy and go on a mass genocide streak.      See? This topic is about as redundant as your worrys. Stop talking about 2012 sicne nothing is going to happen.      But in my personal opinion, I believe c or d is most likely to happen.
20090305073435AAPrYRu	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why does God punish children for their parents sins?	Can anyone tell me why does God punish children for the parents sins?   In another question i read the question was about how can God be perfect if babies are born with deformities,chromosomal abnormalities etc and one answerer said that "some babies are born like that because they are being punished for the sins of their ancestors and this is biblical"   I think this is biblical because i remember reading it in the bible somewhere.Can anyone tell me why God does that?God is just and cant do anything against his nature but this sounds very unjust to me and cruel and also can you please tell me how do you reconcile God cursing/punishing someone like this with other verses in the bible where it says that God wants to heal people?

20090227051424AA0fgKi	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is this really how Christians think?	I was a little shocked at a question I answered, the question being "What are the typical thoughts of a dying atheist". I found this post by (I'm assuming) a Christian, but the last sections seemed so hurtful to me (and a little arrogant), I just wanted to know what other people's views were...      Here's the post that was left:      "it is a sad thought that an Atheist thinks when a person dies that is it,as for me I believe the Word of God that there is a Heaven and I WILL be once again with my Family,friends and the Host of Heaven,that is something to look forward too as for Atheist you guys are an empty shell of a person,hallow down trotten and discouraged........my Heart goes out to you guys and the loneliness you will endure in the Grave"      Now the first half, yep, fine, she's going to enter the kingdom of God, join her friends and family, that's brilliant, no problems with that... But once she starts down the line of "as for Atheist you guys are an empty shell of a person,hallow down trotten and discouraged........my Heart goes out to you guys and the loneliness you will endure in the Grave"??      "An empty shell of a person"?      "hallow down trotten and discouraged"? (I'm assuming it's supposed to read down-trodden)      Anyone else find this quite insulting?

WAIT- before you get bent out of shape, please realize that my mother is half hispanic and so is that entire side of the family. I'm not asking this question to egg on any racism or anything like that. I'm 1/4 hispanic myself.      What I don't understand, from a cultural perspective..what would make hispanic women more jealous and gossipy? Even the prettiest ones, who you wouldn't think need to be jealous, can be just downright hateful. And no, it isn't me. I've seen this when it comes to other girls as well.       I am now with a hispanic man (american) and his parents have all hispanic friends. Everytime we go to parties the women are dressed in very tight clothes (can we say camel-toe) and generally gathering in sep. groups and being fake towards other women in the room. Smiling and saying hi..but looking the other woman up and down hatefully as she leaves. My bf said that they do this to me too. What gives?       And with the gossiping..I don't understand...it actually seems to be like even the men are in on it too...just all of them are so nosy and gossipy. Why does this occur more in  hispanic culture rather than...say...asian culture?

Do you hate it because it makes you look bad and embarrasses you, or because it's something in yourself that you hate?

20090305061808AAqLuQN	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Spiritually Speaking: Believing in a god as opposed to..?	I find it quite amusing and ironic that some people have blind faith for certain religions (and everyone is entitled to that, I respect it), yet refuse to accept that others might have different beliefs (namely paranormal).   In that sense, I respect more Atheists who just don't believe: period.      My question is, WHY do you completely discard the paranormal as not possible YET accept your God with blind faith and you require no proof? (obviously the question is to religious people :P) And please don't come to me about the Bible as proof because it's not. Paganism and Witchcraft are OLDER than the Bible)      I see many ridiculing questions asked on paranormal issue (such as psychic powers, spirits..etc..). How can you absolutely say that is not possible? Because you have not experienced it? Because you have not been given any proofs?

20090305060502AAkNVGf	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Isnt causing harm to yourself forbidden in Islam?Shia's?	Causing harm to oneself       This is forbidden, as God says: You shall not kill yourselves. (4:29) He also says: Do not expose yourselves to ruin. (2:195) The Prophet said: "There shall be no inflicting of harm on oneself". Similarly, it is not permissible to a Muslim to expose himself to the risk of illness or injury in any way or form. The Prophet said: "No believer may humiliate himself". When he was asked how any person would humiliate himself, he said: "By exposing himself to risks with which he cannot cope"5. A man runs the risk of illness or injury if he leaves himself exposed to their causes, or by not taking the necessary precautions to prevent them, or by not taking proper care of his health. Islam has given us the necessary directives to steer away from all such risks, making it a duty of every Muslim.      this image below shows Shia's harming themselves...    http://www.bibleprobe.com/Ashoura2.jpg

I can conclude that God is like a life insurance, you give your faith to Him while a life, He will pay your faith when you have died. How do you think?

20090305074312AAf91zQ	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	I am having a gay affair...?	So, my question title was a little misleading.  I am gay to begin with, so is my relationship, so if my affair...      I'm a 26 year old male.  I've been together with my present boyfriend off-and-on for 6 years.  Off and on only because we've had school in different places.  Now he's here with me in my city, living with me in my apartment.  Things are generally very good between us but there are some problems: the physical passion for each other is much lower than it used to be, he is constantly mad that I have to work so much, he has a bad temper, I have a bad habit of unintentionally saying offensive things, we have different free-time interests, and we're not really sexually compatible.  Sometimes I wonder why we're even still together: except, well, when the times are good between us, they are very good, we click really well, are on the same wavelength, and clearly have a very strong love and connection for each other.        But I've started this little affair with a guy from work who I like a lot.  We haven't had sex, but we have hung out 4 times and made-out and really click.  It's giving this enjoyment and passion and satisfaction that I don't feel in my real relationship.  But it would never work out in the long run, because he is moving away in 3 months, is a bit of a promiscuous flirt, and just doesn't have the intensity and career ambition that I look for in a partner.  It's like, this is really fun, but I don't think I want it to damage my real relationship.  Isn't that hypocritical?  If I really cared about my real realtionship, I wouldn't be doing this, right?  Is this a sign that I should actually end up my real relationship because of my dissatisfaction?  Or is it just an example of a fun temptation that I really need to stop so as not to damage my real relationship?  I feel really bad about what I'm doing but on the other hand I feel like I need this...      And on a completely unrelated note, what if I end up having sex with this guy... I would feel so terrible if I brought home an STD to my real relationship.        What do you think?  Should I keep it going in secret because it's fulfilling a need?  Should I end it now to preserve my real relationship?  Should I ever confess?

20090305073353AA0RK2T	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	A Question about Heaven and Hell?	It seems to me that the concepts of Heaven and Hell are reliant on physical rewards and punishments. However pain and pleasure are strictly perceptions interpreted by our brains. You can severe a nerve fibre and suddenly not be able to feel pain, and likewise severe another connection and not be able to feel good. You can inject chemicals or stimulate certain areas of the brain and be able to feel elated and euphoric; and you can stimulate other areas and feel excruciating pain. Now when we die, supposedly our souls go somewhere either good or bad, depending on how we lived our lives; and either reward or punishment awaits us. But if we are not bringing our physical selves into an afterlife, does that mean our souls have a central nervous system in order to best experience what awaits us? It seems to me that much of the beliefs are centered around what we currently experience and understand, while also preaching that what lies beyond us is beyond our comprehension. This seems like a paradox that is not often discussed, just curious as to thoughts about the subject.

I have a very close male buddy who has come out of the closet last year.We are both 24 year old. His name is Richard. We have known each other since we were 7.We call each other "brother"      We are very comfortable with each other's body and sexuality. We share an apartment together. We sleep next to each other without any clothes but never had sex.  We were both nudist. We went to a very remote nude beach every Sunday. We held hands together on the beach. That's it.       I really enjoy the non-sexual bonding with Richard.We always shower together. I don't mind Richard washing my back. I wash his back as well. However, that's it.We never had sex. I am into gay sex.Richard know that as well. He has never tried to seduce me. We dance together at home ever Saturday night too. The non-sexual male-to-male bonding is amazing       However, some of my straight friends say "Ewww! " to me when they know about Richard.How can I cope with my straight friends?
20090227040001AAIStXF	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians only: how is this fair?	I'm a Christian and when my agnostic friend brought this up it bothered me. I've always believed that people who have not heard of the Bible will not be sent to hell, that would not be fair because they never had a chance to believe. But the problem is that not all get an equal chance to follow Christianity. For example, a child born in the USA has a better chance of being a Christian than a child born in India where 80% of the population is Hindu. Sure they've heard of the Bible, but that does not automatically make things equal. It might be hard for you to believe but if you were born in Saudi Arabia, then you would be a Muslim. Family and social influences play a HUGE role in what religion we end up following.      I know that God will be just and completely fair, so I'm not worried. I am just trying to understand. Why does God give people more of a chance than others?

I accidently sent the apple question to words and word play.     My question is we are all letting one person disturb us too much and we need to get past that and let it go, by not clicking on a person that we know to be angry and probably sad and lonesome too.  We don't know why he is so angry, nor can we analyze his problems and why he comes to our sevior area an be extra unkind with phrases like, "Oh, I am a rebe!"  "I'm enjoying this!"  When I first came to this site, I thought it was too stressful, getting simple answers I wanted the help with deleted.  Then I thought, the anger is in only one person and the rest of you are so nice.  We need to do something, as a group, to not give in this kind of anger, because we are feeding right into it, when we give thumbs down and report him for abuse...because from what he says, that he enjoys the furor he can cause people.  If you know who the person is, pass by his name.  Sad, isn't it?  I don't know what else to do and feel I am doing the opposite of what I did at school.  The neediest children we worked with, were those that needed the love the most....I hate saying to say pass by his name, because he could be one of those people who need love the most, I don't know.  I just know he seems to be an angry person and why he hates seniors is beyond me.  I hope we can all get past this and maybe as I read someplace have a senior citizen's lite, where we can ask memories of the good old days, like the cans and strings someone asked, or the good questions Gladys asks.  Some questions jolt us back to the good old days, the memories and good times, and we need that in today's world.  YOu are a great bunch of people.

20090305091654AAiOqkV	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Does Revelation 7:14 teach the Rapture?	Revelation 7:14- "So right away I said to him: “My lord, you are the one that knows.” And he said to me: “These are the ones that come out of the great tribulation, and they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb".      The Holy Scriptures doesn't support the doctrine. In Proverbs 2:21, 22 it says  "...the upright ones will reside in the earth, and the blameless will be left over in it"...the wicked will be cut off from the earth, and the treacherous will be torn away from it".      Also, if come out of something, don't you have to go into something first?      The Rapture teaches that many righteous ones will be taken from the earth before the great tribulation and that it's the wicked that will experience it.      But as these two scriptures alone show differently...   The righteous shall inherit the earth. The wicked will be the ones taken or rather destroyed from the earth. Simple.

20090305080806AARcIlO	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	What does "whosoever" mean to you?	As I read this BIBLICAL verse of scripture, it does not seem that God is differentiating any specifics of how or what doctrine a Christian believes in, but that "whosoever" believes in Christ is a Christian and will be saved.      John 3:16   16 ? For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.       Where in this verse does it say that one has to believe in "traditional" or the "popular" or the "most common form" of Christian belief to be saved?      To me, "whosoever" means whosoever.  When did "whosoever" come with conditions?  I don't see "conditions" listed any where here.

At the time, I figured that I could get the job and work my way up quickly.  There are several tests that need to be written to even get to the interview stage and I’ve passed one of the tests with the second test scheduled for tomorrow.      I’ve been told that should I pass tomorrow’s test, my references will be contacted.  I’ve realized in the past little while that I really can’t afford to take the pay cut and I don’t want my references to be contacted for a job that I wouldn’t even accept.      I would like to pull out of the selection process and stop wasting everyone’s time, but I really would love to work for this company, just not in this particular position.  How should I approach this so as not to burn my bridges?  Can I tell the truth – I’m interested in working for this company, but not at this level?  Or should I just close the door on this company for a stupid decision in applying in the first place?

Luke24:44b, ...all things must be fulfilled, that were written in the law of Moses & in the Prophets, and in the Psalms concerning me.    47 And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His Name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.    48 And ye are witnesses of these things.   And at the last supper Jesus said, "...For this is my blood of the New Testament, that is shed for many for remission of sins...". Mtt26:28, Mrk14:24, Heb9:20.   Hebrews7&9.   Jesus fulfilled the laws, prophecies & the Psalms. And the Gospel is to preached to the world starting from Jerusalem.      2. So why another Testament that was never prophesied of in the Old Testament, nor the New Testament?      3. Is it because the Jesus' New Testament wasn't good enough?      4. That Jesus (Yeshua/Savior) couldn't save His people from all nations without another Testament given years later to Joseph Smith?

20090305082221AA6lwa6	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why are people in lower/working classes so different than folks in the upper classes, and often clash & hate?	They just seem to be all focused on money, getting by, which is understandible, but America is turning slowly but surely into this working country with absolutely NO care or respect for anything higher, the arts, culture..seeing the world...bettering their communities,...they take no pride or care even in their personal appearance, and almost like condemn others who care about all of that.      I'm upper middle class, and i don't really have to care much about money, because I've always had it, so yeah I can see why it's easy for me to say, but I wasn't always like this. i was born a poor immigrant, at first, but I always respected the arts, culture and wanted to grow/change/evolve.      I also take personal pride in my appearance, I'm into fashion, and yet usually these people, the lower class people or the average joe schmoe, look at me like they hate me, and like I should just "grow up" or that I'm somehow frivolous or weird, just beacuse i'm not a working class schmuck like everyone else and am frantic, crazy, etc.      Do people really think that hardship, working 24/7, paying bills, stress/drama/trauma....is how EVERYONE should be? (and if you're not...they hate you?)         I mean scuse me but,  not all of us HAVE to be in that position, and it's certainly not a crime NOT to be.      It's disguisting.      it really is, even when i was poorer, I lived my life sanely and cared about other things, I was never a workaholic crazed all about money lunatic.         I'm sorry I just find that living your life strapped for money your whole life, and hating on and looking down on others who aren't like that, isn't b7llshit.      I actually have people who look DOWN at me, just because I can afford to look young for my age and dress nicely, thanks to the money I have to be able to afford the cosmetics/clothes I have, and drive a nice car, and didn't have to b8st my a77 for it.      I even have people trying to run me off the roads, and throw things at my car and all sorts of jealousies, literally! I've even had people screaming, shouting.      It'sl ike they're saying" F*CK YOU you piece of SH(T, i hve it so hard, we have it so hard,...america has it so hard,...bla bla, everything is just ahrd ahrd hard hard hard hard hard HARD,......"       like this constant stream of negativity,....like I should somehow give up all my possessions or give it to THEM or something because they think they deserve it and i dont....      whoa! it's like F*CK YOU!        All this negativity and drama....      the working class and poorer classes are such a bitter, dysfunctional, and shady bunch.      But why do they have absoltuely no respect or value of people above their classes, or people who choose to have a different mindset?      I just find this a problem because I happen to live with my partner in an area that's great, but...it's in new jersey, and I have to mingle with regular people and lower class people who I have absolutely NOTHING in common with.      I'm a bit more wealthy, and there's no way of saying this without sounding stuck up, but it's just my current life situation...and I really neeed some advice here. They look at me like I've just stepped out of a fashion shoot from planet Mars or something, and just treat me like I'm a weirdo, and I don't want to exactly fit in or conform with them, because I really feel like I'd be lowering my standards, or conforming...and I'm an individualist.      it's like whenever I go to richer places, richer hangouts, I fit right in, and people LOVE me,      and whenever I go to like a walmart, or a lower class neighborhod or even some middle class places...I get treated like ****, or people just look at me and stare like I'm from mars or something.         This is really disturbing me, and I'm starting to feel like I'm the bad guy and should be embarassed and ashamed over my life achievements and the way I choose to dress, etc.

Im asking friends, why do the Farmers and agricultural industry not get enough respect and recognition? why are the schools in UK also not teaching youth how to farm and be self sufficient instead people all put the emphamsis on being a young "yuppie" wear a suit and work in the city and i have met lots of people young people working in the city who get paid lots of moneys ￡￡￡$$$ but have no clue of basic economics and basic understanding, they tell me its about gift of gab. So why is the western world not giving more credit and courses and schools to teach people about agricultural and farming and the real industrys instead of the fancy name positions some big organisations have where they have so many levels or managers doing nothing.      Sorry for my english      Vlad

20090305091949AAn3F84	Society & Culture;Etiquette	I pissed off my co-worker... what would you do?	I answered the phone yesterday at work and it was a caller for a co-worker.  She told me it was for her mother (who also works with us) so I took it to her.  It was a creditor so she told me she "wasn't available".  I went back and asked her daughter if she allowed her mother to open credit cards in her name.  I immediately realized my mistake in asking and apoligized.  I could tell it really upset her, so I apoligized again later.  I wasn't trying to be nosy, I was genuinely concerned as I have known her for some time now.   Well... this morning the mother approached me and said "if you want to keep this relationship professionalyou better stay out of our business" and something to the effect of "my daugher would do anything to protect me".  As in open credit cards so her mother could max them out and not pay them.   Anyway... I honestly DO feel horrible and don't plan on interfering with their business.  I keep getting the side-long looks like I am scum of the earth and they are VERY intimidating people!  I certainly didn't ask to be nosy, but I can see how it comes across that way.   How would you smooth this over?

Again, a serious question, please inform me (copy and paste Mormon guy, save your diatribe) how does one get allowed into the temple to attend one of your services? Do you have to convert first? I mean if someone is religion shopping shouldn't they be able to see what they are getting into first? Or is that the appeal: the secrecy?

What is the point of the cards? When did that start? WHY did it start? What's the big secret? Or is it a safety issue?       Thanks

20090305091517AAFSv2z	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Who created the credited God?	aside from the obvious answer, Man. Christians say that creation needs a creator because the universe is too complex to have just been. Yet, an all powerful, all knowing, perfect MOST complex creator needs no introduction into existence. Christians say God always has been. Does this really make sense to you? I know that the creation or eternal existence of the universe is still up for grabs in the science department. But come on a sky fairy? Really? that's the best you got?   do just fall back on faith, really try and explain how "God" came about. If you can't do it and still believe, maybe you should think about talking to guys in white coats.
20090305090133AAt4Wf7	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Will you accept Horus as your Personal Savior?	The Egyptian mythical Horus, god of light and goodness has many parallels to Jesus. [Leedom, Massey] For some examples:      Horus and the Father as one    Horus, the Father seen in the Son    Horus, light of the world, represented by the symbolical eye, the sign of salvation.    Horus served the way, the truth, the life by name and in person    Horus baptized with water by Anup (Jesus baptized with water by John)    Horus the Good Shepherd    Horus as the Lamb (Jesus as the Lamb)    Horus as the Lion (Jesus as the Lion)    Horus identified with the Tat Cross (Jesus with the cross)    The trinity of Atum the Father, Horus the Son, Ra the Holy Spirit    Horus the avenger (Jesus who brings the sword)    Horus the afflicted one    Horus as life eternal    Twelve followers of Horus as Har-Khutti (Jesus' 12 disciples      I mean after all he predates Jesus who stole his resume.

I often wonder...what is worse for beleivers...people not believing in ANY god or people not believing in THEIR god. What gets them angrier...or is a non believer in their particular god all that matters, whether they beleive in no god or a different god from theirs?         And to anyone that wants to say anything about atheists beign so judgmental and critical etc, beleivers, please realize that atheists (not all but some) probably do that because they are living in a country (US) that is 80% believers. Atheists have your religion shoved down their throat on tv, in newspapers, in holidays, in laws, etc. There are a lot of unreasonable and irrational people...beleivers and non believers, so lets not go there with this question.

20090305084900AAh8K01	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If God is all-powerful, is it possible for him to break the laws of reality?	For instance, E=mc2. Can God create energy, or destroy it? Can God make 2 + 2 = something other than 4?      It is said that God did not invent morality, rather, morality is an objective thing which God simply understands and passes on to mankind. If this is true, can the same thing be said of the laws of reality and physics? Did God make 2 + 2 = 4, or did it always? If energy cannot be created or destroyed, did God make that law or does He live by it?      And if energy cannot be created or destroyed...then human beings are just as eternal as God is. The alternative theory is that God invented the rules of science, and could have just as easily inverted all of the rules of physics we know now....this is confusing me.      Thoughts?

20090305082402AAWQ7mT	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Why are people so vehement about denying Blacks their historical accomplishments?	I am a historical researcher and I have noticed that other racial groups over the last 40 years have been given their "dues" in contributing to civilization. I.E  the aztec and chinese achievements were supposed to be a mystery to the modern world & there was even speculation that aliens built their civilization. Until recently they were not credited with their accomplishments.  But Blacks on the other hand have been vehemently denied their civilization's achievement's all the way from Egypt to Zimbabwe.  Note:  Before the 17 and 1800's Egyptians(in the earlier part of their kindgdom before the Ptolemies) , Moors, Nubians and the early Ethiopians were considered black africans i.e shakespeare, herodotus, etc etc all ancient historians gave detailed accounts.  But now even with overwhelming evidence people are slow to give them credit.  Why is this?  I wonder that now that we alll have our cake why can't they have theirs as well

My mum is a Jehova's Witness and although I believe in Jehova and Jesus etc etc ....she has put the fear of God himself into me regarding Armageddon and whether she has meant to or not....she has made me feel like its only baptized Jehova's Witnesses that will be saved which is not a nice thought ...especially when you have two young babies like I do. A couple of JWs came to my house the other month and I know this sounds weird but I was kinda expecting them. We started a Bible Study but certain things arent sitting right with me. There are all these rules and nit picky things that they do and adhere to....and when they show me the scrpiture that 'backs up' the practice....sometimes I dont see how it does....they have just interpreted it that way. I dont want mans interpretation of God....I want God. Does this make sense to anyone? I believe in God, I believe he is called Jehova , that is a historical fact. I believe he created ALL things and I believe he sent his son, Jesus Christ as a sacrifice for all men to gain salvation....I believe that God will bring this horrible world to an end and create a better way of life.....but all this ....birthdays......women wearing skirts.....only Jehovas Witnesses being saved....it doesnt seem to fit in with the main theme of the Bible....which I think....is love. God's Love for people, his son and the love that we should have for God, His son and others. If we all did that....wouldnt the world be a better place? Does it make me a bad person because i like my levis 501s and because I buy my babies presents when they are another year older? Didnt Jesus say the kingom of God is within you....didnt Jesus say that whoever believes in him will be saved......isnt the watchtower society just that....a society, an institution....a mini government ? Does this not oppose Jesus's way of life and living? Im not having a go at Jehova's Witnesses, I respect them in part but .....I feel like everyone on this planet has segregated themselves into groups and they all think they are the ONES....the RIGHTEOUS and i find it disturbing........can anyone shed some light....or guidance or opinion...whatever really. Im having a bad day aaaagh!

My question is, does any sect of the church have any doctrines regarding this issue? Or possibly a theologian that discusses this topic that I could look into further?      Thanks in advance.

20090305083431AAIhQsH	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you know that Maharishi Agastya was the Father of Tamil langauge ?	It is well known amongst tamils people  that maharishi Agastya was the father of tamil langauge , who gave tamil a written script .    Had Pali & Prakrit existed even todate they may easily rival tamil as an ancient language , unfortunately due to islamic invasions these languages died ( Today hindi is dominant ).      But DMK ( & other Dravadian Parties ) which is a alter ego of the congress , insisted that tamil is the most ancient language & also played the role of Tiruvelluvar in tamil but also straightforwardly ignored the contribution of Tamil Brahmins & Ancient gurus like Maharishi Agastya who actuall gave Tamil its written script.One of the primary aims of parties like DMK & Congress is to divide Hindus . Both parties are Anti Hindu .      Not surprisingly Karunanidhi ( DMK )  cooperated with the congress , when Sri Lankans were annihilating the Tamils & LTTE in sri Lanka.      Scritpt Used in Thailand  , Phillipines indonesia ...etc are derived from from tamil , but they are also have rich Sanskrit words .      We also need to realise that many tamil devotional songs are translations from Sanskrit ( just like Chinese translated Pali & sanskrit Texts ) .      If sanskrit can be considered to be most ancient language in the world , can we Hindus be considered very ancient race ( unlike Westerners , who claim to have decended from Monkeys of africa ) ??

I said how much? he pointed to the cash register and kept quite, so i pulled out a $20 dollar and put on the counter. He just kept staring, and i said "there you go, $20" he said show me ID, so i showed him.      He looked at the ID for like 3minutes, like he was lost, i kindly pointed out the birth date on the ID, he got mad, said i got it man! i got it !      1 more minute later, he put the ID on the counter, beside the $20 bill, kept staring at me again. He asked me, what brings you here? I was like what the heck? i answer him i came here for Business.       He then said, i am not comfortable with this, and reject the sales. By the way, i am 29 years old, i might look very young to him, as asian people tend to look younger to American people.      Is there any government agencies that can teach him a lesson? he obviously reject sales to me because i am an Asian.

Hi there, first thing I would like to say is I really don't want to offend anybody with this post so please forgive me if i am out of line anywhere. I basically have a question regarding transexual women and would appreciate any honest answers from tsw. I know tsw feel they are women trapped in mens bodies and genuinely consider themselves as women. But my limited understanding is that a woman is simply the one of the species who has ovaries and a womb or is born closer to this than that of male physical aspects. (I am aware of intersexed people and I would consider these people in this discussion as being born of the sex they feel they are). I have a theory, probably wrong, that tsw are simply men or boys, who have grown up feeling inadequate to other men, for many number of reasons, and develope female behaviours inorder to get intimate with others. Sorry again if I have insulted anyone. I would really appreciate any answers from tsw with ideas as to what they feel makes them a woman, as they do not have the relevant biology.  Thanks very much, Rog.

I just started classes and I always see people leaving at random points without acknowledging anyone.       Is it common knowledge that if you need to leave class early for something, or to use the bathroom that you just get up and go? This has happened in almost all of my classes.

We had it where I grew up,    but I can remember going    to visit my grandparent's   farm.   Lighting the coal oil lamps at dark.

They had a battery (?)radio but   they would only play it once in a   while for the news and then TRY    to 'bring in' the Grand Ole Opry   on Saturday night.

Believe in Jesus alone for salvation, that He died for your sins and rose again, and you will NEVER be sent to hell, no matter what!"

The term was applied because when the Shee'ah approached Zayd ibn 'Alee ibn al-Husayn (the great grandson of 'Alee ibn Abee Taalib), may Allaah be pleased with him, they asked him what he thought about Aboo Bakr and 'Umar, may Allaah be pleased with them.      Zayd praised Abu Bakr and 'Umar responded: "They are the ministers of my grandfather."      Upon hearing this the Shee'ah rejected Zayd ibn 'Alee ibn al-Husayn and his leadership. And this is why they are called the "Raafidhah".

20090305100842AAgK1jA	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If you saw the Bill Maher movie Religilous:  Did it offend you?	Now to start I saw it and loved it..i thought it was funny while promoting some thought  on an issue that societry as a whole seems to think is sacrosant and cannot be thought about freely.      My favorite scene is Bill with the truckers.  He preaches he doesn't know and they preach Christ....but they pretty much all got along and were nice and were all smiles and everything...I thought that was great..that he could ask questions and when he did not convert they were fine with that.      Now I am asking if you saw did it offend you and if so why?  Does the asking of questions offend you?  Is it the questioning of what we are supposed to take on "faith" from you (I am a Deist)?        If that offends you then can you explain why it is ok for religions to come and question me and try to convert me, but if others do the same (doing unto others you could say) then it is disrespectful?        I ask because one of my buddies took offense but for life of me I cannot find a reasonable and valid reason why it should.  If you have faith you wouldn't mind the questions and if you don't then these are questions you need to reflect on.

20090305094240AAycIlQ	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	What is the true meaning of this for you ?	Joy means the perfect fulfilment of that for which I was created and   regenerated, not the successful doing of a thing. The joy Our Lord   had lay in doing what the Father sent Him to do, and He says - "As My   Father hath sent Me, even so am I sending you." Have I received a   ministry from the Lord? If so, I have to be loyal to it, to count my   life precious only for the fulfilling of that ministry. Think of the   satisfaction it will be to hear Jesus say - "Well done, good and   faithful servant"; to know that you have done what He sent you to do.   We have all to find our niche in life, and spiritually we find it   when we receive our ministry from the Lord. In order to do this we   must have companied with Jesus; we must know Him as more than a   personal Saviour. "I will show him how great things he must suffer   for My sake."      "Lovest thou Me?" Then - "Feed My sheep." There is no choice of   service, only absolute loyalty to Our Lord's commission; loyalty to   what you discern when you are in closest contact with God. If you   have received a ministry from the Lord Jesus, you will know that the   need is never the call: the need is the opportunity. The call is   loyalty to the ministry you received when you were in real touch with   Him. This does not imply that there is a campaign of service marked   out for you, but it does mean that you will have to ignore the   demands for service along other lines.
20090305100813AApmDdn	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Fundamentalists, How would you have responded to this situation?	Please, I am looking for answers that are respectful only.      I dated a Free Will Baptist.   The Free will baptist man was in the process of divorcing but lacked the finances to do so but he did manage to find the funding to get the process going.   He had been seperated from his wife for two years and they were divorcing for adultery on his ex's part.   I entered his life and we started a friendship that soon turned into much more as I we were both fond of each other...He loved the Lord...was a bible study leader, gave sermons in his church, volunteered at various canned food drives, was a youth leader, youth basketball coach and drove the church bus.   He would do anything for anyone.  He had a true heart of gold.  I admired his outward qualities but I believe his "inner" man had some work to do.         After dating for nearly a year...I could not continue a relationship with a man who did not see the need to be free from his marriage.  He wasn't trying to achieve it and didn't care about it....his family, his church, and his friends all thought he finished his divorce yet he decieved them all.  I called him up and advised him that I could no longer continue the relationship as it was...as I felt like I was committing adultery.         He accepted this at first then after 3 weeks he dumped me, went out clubbing, hooked up with another woman who was still married and started seeing her.   He finished his divorce...moved in with his new woman.....she finished her divorce and they got married.   Never once did he lose status in his church and when I spoke to the pastor about my reasons for taking a breather from our relationship my ex advised me that the devil was using me to ruin church for him.      He claimed that since he wasn't married to me or engaged to me that he had every right to do this and he doesn't answer to man...he answers only to God.   He claimed that he prayed what God's will was for his life and that is when they met.        The church put her in a position of teaching before she was even divorced and while she was living with my ex.   I am not judging but is this typical to not care what kind of life your flock leads?     Isn't it the pastor's job to say something?  I felt very used, when all I was trying to do was be obedient to the word of God.

20090305094210AAalCZJ	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	My friends say that my 'dream' in life is old fashioned, am I strange?	Hi there,      Sometimes I find myself repressing some of my true desires in life from my friends or family. They all seem to think I'm strange or old fashioned. I guess it's because my friends and family are all metropolitan of sorts or raised in cities. I was too but I have a different view.       This is what I desire: I want to live on a piece of land with trees and a small holding farm. Nothing big, just maybe some chickens, a HUGE garden and all kinds of fruits and veggies. I fantasize about spending warm summer afternoons canning fruit with the kids, picking herbs from the garden, showing the children how carrots are grown. I dream of sitting on a porch looking at beautiful nature and letting the breeze run though the house. I want to get AWAY from generalized society. I don't want a fancy car, I don't want a huge house, I don't want the latest purse or sunglasses. I just want to get back to basics. I'm embarrassed when I go for lunch with my lady friends and they talk about what their husbands purchased for them, and all I can think about is "gosh I wouldn't want that.." I can appreciate that they have different views, and that's what makes life interesting, but I feel compelled to 'fit in' so to speak.      How do I let myself be me, and be okay with my goals and dreams even when they don't fit into the societal goal of more accumulation and material goods = wealth, scheme of things?

20090305101022AAirqwU	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Can we blame Obama for anything?	We can't expect Obama to clean up Bush's mess in a mere 4 years. It will take at least two terms. I don't care if at the end of Obama's presidency the economy is 10x as bad as it ever was with the great depression, the blame ultimately belongs to Bush and we all know it. Maybe in 50 years we can do a documentary that explores Obama's presidency and policies, but for at least the next 40 years all blame has to go to Bush for everything.       I still blame Bush for my D in my biology class last semester. And I have gained 5 pounds in the last year thanks to Bush. And I noticed my gold swing was off last week. I couldn't figure out why. Then it hit me who was responsible. Nice try Bush.       To make matters worse, last week gas prices in my area actually went down and I was like "thank you Obama." Then they went back up a little this week and I was like "why does Bush keep ruining my life." And then to top it all off I ran into this hot girl who I asked out and she rejected me. I couldn't be more angry with Bush for screwing up that one. I can forgive him for the other things, but why did he have to screw that up?

I mean...think about how horrible this world would be if all of us walked around thinking we all sucked, no one was special, everyone was just a john doe and what not!

20090305051927AAuO3mA	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Issues with identity: Being someone of mixed 'race' but being brought up as white?	Firstly let me just state I have quotation marked 'race' as one of my University lecturers quotes, 'race is a social construction, not a bioligical one'.       The issue I have is that I myself have a Mother whose background is English European and my father who is Pacific Islander and wondering about others who are in similar situations as me, whether you call yourself white, black or mix-'raced'. I have for many years had issues with identity considering asking myself am I white or am I black? Both parents are divorced and I have always lived with my mothers side which are all English European, something which for years I solely considered myself as, but after my studies in racism in University have I realised the issues of whiteness being that they percieve themselves as white and therefore I have had to aswell. Only now  am I really coming to terms with identity issues paticularly when I talk to my mum about these things or happen to stick up for those oppressed in which she starts arguments saying that I have a thing against white people etc.       And yeah, sometimes I find it really hard to deal with, does anyone else have similar problems?

Please only if you are a German native can you answer this question.      i do not want any online translators as i can do that myself.       My task was to write about my favourite film...and i chose The Lion King lol       I tried to translate most of it myself but do not have any additional resourced for the main piece.       can you please check and try to translate the middle part - any help is appriciated       Mein Lieblingsfilm ist ''The Lion King'', weil die Handlung hervorragend ist. Das Film ist sehr ein druckscoll und das lied von Elton John ist auch toll. Ich finde ''Disney Films'' toll, aber ich sehe nicht gern Romantischfilms weil sie ist langweilig zu beobachten.       The main plot is about a young lion called Simba who must defeat his evil uncle, after he made everyone believe Simba murdered his father. The great twist in the play and all the action scenes make it my favourite film. Unlike other films, The Lion King does not rely on popular actors and it is still brilliant. My favourite part is the climax where Simba defeats his uncle and takes control of the pride.       Insgesamt der Film appelliert ist alle Altersgruppen und bleibt mein Lieblingsfilm immer. Ich empfehle es jedem.

20090305092424AAluqMw	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do some Christians hate truth?	What kind of question is this? hahahaha      I see a few Christians comment from time to time that no true Christian would ever give up their salvation. The belief is that if you truly believe and understand that you will never turn away from it. Or if you have turned away, it is only because you never really believed in the first place.      I know it is true for at least one person (me). I used to believe with my whole heart. I spent hours and hours praying to God. I read the bible and asked God to show me the way. I believed with everything in me and loved God. I know I did. If someone wants to argue with me about what I already know in this case, they are just in denial and cannot accept the truth. No one can really prove a feeling. I can't prove to anyone that I used to be a believer. All I can do is know it the same way I know I used to love my girlfriend back in high school. It's the same way I knew I used to like the taste of pizza and still do. I can't prove it though. I don't need to.      So then, some Christians will refuse to accept this truth. Don't you know that when you deny something like that that I KNOW to be true, it pretty much kills your credibility with everything else you say? How am I supposed to be convinced of anything you say about your religion when you display a blatant disregard for the fact that I used to be a Christian but am not any more? Ask yourself seriously, is this attitude of yours an accurate representation of what Christ wants? Part of the reason people give up on Christianity is because of people with attitudes like yours. Why turn people away when you are supposed to be turning them on to Christianity? Seriously!

20090305095120AAewKnR	Society & Culture;Languages	Will English ever be overtaken as the leading language in the next 100 years?	How long will English maintain its hegemony? I say for at least 100+ years, because while yes China is becoming a world power, their language is incredibly difficult to learn, as nearly all other languages have alphabets, Chinese, along with Japanese, Korean don't. The lack of ability to connect sounds to writing I believe is a massive gap which is why Chinese will never be a lingua franca. Also, English will maintain its power because the basics are very easy to learn, as the lack of gender, adjective and noun agreement, and easy verb conjugation helps the learner, and makes up for the pronunciation and spelling problems. French will not be big again as it was before WWI, because France  and the French speaking world is far smaller and less influential than the English speaking world, which includes US, UK, Canada, Australia, South Africa, etc. NATO has two founding members who speak English, also the G8. German is only spoken in Germany, Austria, and Lichtenstein with a smattering in Belgium. Spanish is big, but concentrated in Latin America, which is very economically uninfluential. This is why English I believe will be big for the next 100+ years.

And have just recently admitted that to myself. You see Ive had this friend for about 2 years now. I guess u can say she one of my best friends. I admitted to myself that I sorta have feelings for her.(By the way she's straight) and ever since then everything's been different. It gets harder and harder every day to talk to her like she's some kind of hot guy or something. And I don't feel as close to her as I used to. We used to talk ALOT ALL the time. But now we just go through the day w/o saying 2 words 2 each other. I think she knows. She's been acting really strange lately. Like she doesn't WANT to talk to me. I say hi to her and she just blows me off. and I kinda feel like she's avoiding me. I don't want to have all these dumb feelings for her. I just want my friend back. What should I do?
20090305095114AA7kRBp	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Believers...does it bother you that the bible is man made?	This is a multilayered question strictly to get multiple responses from poeple...it is not a one question question.   It is fairly know fact that regardless if the stories of the bible or true or not, that they were written by man.   Some argue that the bible is the end all be all and holds the answers to all the questions. Do you beleive the bible is perfect and just the way god wanted it cover to cover...and that it was begun and completed some 1500 years ago? Do you not concede the fact that man is inherently wicked and had some hand in manipulating the individual wirtings that compose the bible...adding to stories to make them sound better, deleting that which did not fit or did not seem to "work." Are you aware/does it bother you that the bible was a work put together to convert gentiles and jews, so of course it had to "fit together" to be believed, had to answer the unanswerable questions, and had to have "marketability" and "sellability." It would not have done so well was it not selling something to people that they wanted (salvation and answers) and was not done in the most convincing way.   I am unable to beleive the bible in any way shape or form because it seems to be largely fables, unverified, not proof-checked, susceptible to errors and corruption back in the day. It baffles me when I as an atheist speak to beleivers and they quote the bible as god's word, when they know, or at least should know, that it was written by man(inherently evil)...and even if inspired by god, was put together and manipulated by less than perfect men. Whatever it is...a tv program, newspaper, book, bible, etc...it would bother me that there is no way to prove any of the "facts" presented. Does the fact that it comes down to faith make the bible and otehr religious books/texts immune from the fact checking process that every other book adheres to?    And why, if atheists don’t believe in god, do beleivers use the bible to defend their views or attack atheists's views… atheists don’t believe in god, much less give authority to the book people say was inspired by him, which we don’t believe exists anyway.   Just curious as to your thoughts. Thanks

I'm not a lesbian but recently I met this girl through a friend & I can't stop thinking about her. I'm 23, single and she's 29, single. I met her in a bar once, then added her on bebo - sent comments to eachother (we get on great very similar) then I saw her at the pub last night again (karaoke night). As I was ordering drinks, I caught her looking at me then we both looked away then back and smiled, & as the night went on got talking/joking more. I actually started flirting with her complimenting her dress, touching her hair, looking her up and down...& somehow we got onto the conversation of guys & she said she thought i had a boyfriend...so i explained no and she said she didnt either. I asked her for her number...& as the night was ending she said that I should come back to another friends house she was staying at (she didnt ask the girl if i could)...but I said I couldn't as I was at another friends house...but that we should go out again soon....Tonight she messaged me to say she had a great night & she thinks I'm a good singer. I do feel confused because i'm not a lesbian but I'm thinking about her very sexually. I just dont know what to do incase she's not interested like that. I need to reply to her so I need to say something that shows her I'm interested without being obviously flirting? Help!

20090305092914AA9cJQB	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	What should I do (in your opinion)?	Hi!!!! I am 13 years old and I am a home-schooled 8th grader. I started home-schooling in 7th grade because I am a competitive gymnast and I needed a flexible schedule. Anyway, I am the youngest 8th grader in my town. If I lived in any other town I would be in 7th grade. I am supposed to be going to public high school next year. My mom thinks it might be better if I home school for one more year and take 9th grade courses but then enter 9th grade in a public school the year after because I am so young; I am 12 for a while in the beginning of 8th grade). However, I do not struggle in school; I am a year ahead in math and I get straight A's. My mom thinks if I home-school one more year then I will have an extra year to develop more as an athlete and get to be normal age for 9th grade. But I don't want to be held back, especially because I am not struggling in school and all of my friends are entering 9th grade next year. What should I do (in your opinion)?

20090305094510AAueZFQ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Religion, the opiate of the masses?	Religion is, indeed, the self-consciousness and self-esteem of man who has either not yet won through to himself, or has already lost himself again. But man is no abstract being squatting outside the world. Man is the world of man—state, society. This state and this society produce religion, which is an inverted consciousness of the world, because they are an inverted world. Religion is the general theory of this world, its encyclopedic compendium, its logic in popular form, its spiritual point d'honneur, its enthusiasm, its moral sanction, its solemn complement, and its universal basis of consolation and justification. It is the fantastic realization of the human essence since the human essence has not acquired any true reality. The struggle against religion is, therefore, indirectly the struggle against that world whose spiritual aroma is religion. Religious suffering is, at one and the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people. The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions. The criticism of religion is, therefore, in embryo, the criticism of that vale of tears of which religion is the halo.        What are your thoughts on this?

20090305100523AAANrjk	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why do people expect everyone to feel sorry for them when they were living beyond their means, had a job but j?	you know, I graduated college in May 2008, and the whole time I was in college I just kept thinking "geez, I just want to get out of here and get a job already!" to the point where I literally had my things packed and was going to drop out. I was on a small campus and had to stay there almost 24/7 because I can't drive (the state of Maryland mandates driving school which costs $325, for everyone regardless of age) my parents could not help me, so I was at a school I hated only because it was the cheapest one available, and I relied completely on financial aid (truth be told I just hated the fact that it was historically black, because the area where I grew up was primerally black and I wanted to go somewhere that was ethnically diverse for a change).  But through it all I just kept telling myself to "just stick it out till you graduate; THEN you'll be able get a job."       Now all of that time when I was in college "just sticking it out", being unable to have job and not spending any money (I did not even buy books, I just got whatever used or outdated ones I could from the library) while I watched others spend money, I assume all during this time the economy was stable and it would have been easy to get a job if I had graduated college and was looking for a job then (like in 2007, 2006 e.t.c.), yet when I wonder why I can't find a job now, people just blame it on the economy, and I can't even get UNEMPLOYMENT because I have never been able to get a job. So when I hear people who have had steady, good paying work their entire lives complain about now being out of work, I really just have to wonder how they can complain when they have everything else going for them: a job, a family, unemployment money, a decent place to live, decent food...you know where I am living at 23? In a crappy trailer with my dad and 24 year old autistic brother. My dad gets exactly $821 from a "retirement" check, but our rent is $583, his medicine is $35 and we also have other bills. I can't even look for work because I can't drive and my dad only wants to go where he wants/needs to go, when he "feels like it." And I can't tell you how many people I have had tell me how good I look and can't believe I do not have a bf, but I have SAD and major trust issues from people stalking/trying to take advantage of me, so whenever I even do happen to see a guy when I am out I either lose my nerve or he is already with a girl. I want to have a bf and I want to have kids and I want to have my own family just like all of these people do. Even if they do not have a job, at least they have that, and probably do at least have SOME money and if they want to drive they probably can. I don't have any of it!   Also, my whole life any money I have had I have LITERALLY saved it, and I can only imagine how much money I would have right now if I was ever able to get a job, because I KNOW I would save money. I do not buy things like all of these other people out here who waste money and live beyond their means. I buy only what I need and perhaps something I want if I have any money (but I never do) and will not even shop at a thrift store if I do not need it. I have even been wearing the same clothes for years. I just need a job!   Oprah where a woman had a 7BEDDROM HOME FULL OF STUFF! and food that she just threw out, and I cried as I yearned for the food she was disposing of. I simultaneously went to the fridge in our crappy trailer, which was completely empty except for an inch of milk in a jug, a sports bottle of water, and a pot of beans which my dad had borrowed $1 and purchased the beans for $1. I just literally DO NOT KNOW how people can do all of these things and expect anyone to feel sorry for them. I have had to live this way my whole life and not felt sorry for myself or said anything.

20090227062601AAjDYnS	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Why did this Nigerian get so offended?	OK. I know this guy and have known him for about four years. He's Nigerian and, for the record, i've never seen him with a black woman. Always another race. Fast forward to yesterday. So i'm shooting pool and someone makes a comment about me losing. So I made a comment that it didn't matter because I just got a 100% on a Memorandum of Law for one of my courses, as well as a 100% on a test.      All the Nigerian heard was 100%. So he shoots his head at me and says, "100% what?"  I tell him what I said and he says, "Oh, I thought you were saying a thoroughbred" Meaning 100% black. So, it kind of annoyed me that he was even going to go there with me in the first place, and especially since we were the only blacks there at thetime.      So, I go on to ask him if he had genetic testing done to prove he was 100% (because he professed it tirelessly) and we got into this HUGE debate with him saying I'm ridiculous and me saying i'm just being logical.  I said, "For someone who solely dates non-black women, you sure are trying to convince me that you're 100%."      Needless to say, he is pissed with me.      So, what's your take?

20090305085521AArJkRA	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Mormons, how would you convert a Catholic?	This is a serious question, and I am hoping that a real LDS member who actually knows about conversion will answer (copy and paste guy, spare us your diatribe).       So let's talk about this, educate me. How does LDS convert Catholics? Do you insist on a Mormon baptism right out of the gate? You know since we don't acknowledge each others baptisms? On that, what if a Catholic refuses because they have been taught their whole life that only one baptism is allowed? If they aren't baptized are they barred from the temple?       How do you explain the communion to Catholics? When can a catholic convert actually take communion in your temples? Is there a waiting period or a level you must reach before taking communion at an LDS temple?      So tell me, how exactly do you convert Catholics? Is it more difficult/involved then say a fundamentalist Christian?      Thanks.   (Don't worry Catholics, I'm not jumping ship, I am just broadening my knowledge.)

20090305085215AACHJgw	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How to develop Psychic ability?	First of all, I'm not crazy, on drugs or drunk, but  over the years I feel I am somewhat psychic (I call it intuitive as I don't like the terminology psychic - makes me sound like a freak).  I can often see,  hear and sense spirits (sometime communicate with them), at times I can sense what someone is thinking (not always), can easily get a complete profile on a stranger from a photo (have done this a few times with friends), Immediately know something that happened in an area (Can't explain, I just do), know when I'm going to get a visitor (never wrong) etc, etc.  Anyway, my question is, how do I develop this ability safely (without attracting negative spirits) ??? At present, it feels like there needs to be more consistency, cause at times things can be scattered.  Furthermore, I would love to know your psychic abilities/experiences.   Any other info be great.  Thanks heaps.
20090227064218AAqlx84	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Noise and my neighbours!!?	I live in an apartment block in Spain, it's  nice and in a beautiful, delightful area in a Spanish town. There are very few non Spanish people here in the area and I have always been happy with my lot.     However two years ago a young couple bought the apartment above me and since then they have made life impossible. They did not live there full time until last year after they got married. They completely refurbished the place and did most of the work in summer when my friends and family visit me. They worked from 8am until 10.30pm and even when I asked them could they follow the community rules of stopping work between 2.30 until 5.30pm.     They told me that they could do what they liked. They have had parties until 3.30 pm and they come in every Friday & Saturday night in the early hours.      They then have showers, they flush the toilets at this time and wake me up constanly every weekend. She in particular walks around in high heels from the moment she gets up until she gets into bed eve3n to go to the toilet. I have tried to speak to them several times but they refuse to listen and have been abusive and have used several racial terms & insults. Telling me that "FOREIGNERS" are not welcome in the building, town or Spain. I'm an Irish national intitled to live and work in Europe as the Spanish can do in the EU!!    Today is a holiday in many places in Southern Spain due to Andalucia Day and all the schools are closed. As I'm a teacher I have the day off and my wonderful nieghbours choose today to tear out all their fitted wardrobes.Not yesterday or any other day that I'm out and working but today with the full knowledge that I have today off!!     When I went up to ask them how long it would take as I had invited people for lunch they said "All Day" and all weekend and shut the door. I' ve cancelled my lunch and I can't take any more of their racist remarks or their lack of understanding their noise makes. PLEASE what can I do???
