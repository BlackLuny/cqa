0UV0PwDLaa	Hmm, I had the same problem a few days ago. Certain music can really get you depressed, thinks like metal, rock, rap, and some pop.<br>  <br>  I would try to listen to some soft, inspirational songs. Anything you can think of, you can search for the music videos on youtube.<br>  <br>  I am interested about your parents, do they push you in school? If you are feeling depressed and you have a good relationship with your parents, you may want to tell your Mom or Dad how you feel, they're probably going to be better at cheering you up than me.<br>  <br>  You seem worried about getting into college, In today's society it is considered a necessity, I know.  You can be happy even if you don't get into college, your still very smart and you'll be able to work your way up to a good job. I don't, however think that getting Bs in social studies will mess up your future.<br>  <br>  P.S. Mediocre is NOT a bad thing. Your above-average in school, trust me. So what if social studies isn't your thing, you'll find what your good at eventually.<br>  <br>  I used to feel just like you, but then someone told me on the internet I had a good writing ability. I notice your pretty good at writing too. I started to use my ability to help people, I have only recently started Yahoo Answers, but I have been able to use my one ability for allot of good.<br>  <br>  You'll find what your good at, you may have already found it and just saw it as not important. When you do find what your good at, milk it for all it's worth. Try to use your ability in whatever situation you can, and I'm sure you'll do all right.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I'll be praying for you.|`|GfNVcq7Naa	WHen we feel depressed we often think far sighted. What I mean is that we never really think about the simple things like good nutritious food, good sleep, sunlight, and exercise.

6810e02779e654863b71475b91405d0aaa	A recession is a period of declining economic activity and GDP, and in modern usage a depression  is an extended period of high unemployment with the economy performing below potential  even though  GDP may be increasing. Prior to the 1930's economic downturn s were called depressions, and before then they were called banking panics. Given what is happening today   maybe we should return to the label banking panic.|`|rc4B8Vdaaa	hahahaha! Yes, and another joke, unemployment rate is only   8%|`|N9VWMIFxaa	Unemployment rate is not 8.1%, it is around 15 or 16% as they are not calculating it like they used to as people whom no longer are looking for work along with part time workers at places like walmart and mcdonalds count as employed.<br>  <br>  This has been a very beautiful depression because this is needed to cure the system which has been filled with propaganda and lies.

0rdGQme7aa	I have just come to the conclusion that i will say what i believe and not label those beliefs because everyones view on feminism is different.|`|mCAWxobNaa	When you bring up legitimate points about how modern Feminism has really caused hardship for a great number of men, suddenly the conversation changes; a modern Feminist will attempt to derail the point of the question in an effort to somehow discredit the author of the question rather than to answer the question at hand.<br>  <br>  The truth is that modern Feminism has had very negative consequence and men share story after story of how it's affected them, yet their issues are made into a joke by Feminists.  Feminists begin to invoke a silly discussion of patriarchy and male dominated society and other such nonsense... anything to avoid dealing with the real matter at hand, which is that men are, indeed, suffering as a direct result of modern Feminism.  If I were to supply nine-hundred examples of how, then Feminists would demand more.  It's a losing battle when the other side doesn't come to the table with an open mind.<br>  <br>  Feminists don't care about the well-being of men.  Most don't like to say it or even think about it, but at the end of the day, Feminists place their own interests above all else and feel that any harm done to men is justified.<br>  <br>  Women's rights are as critical to me as men's rights.  Neither should have to have more rights than the other.  The moment a woman dares to say that attaining rights at the expense of men is wrong, she gets labeled as a traitor to the cause.  The very questioning of Feminism is regarded as foul and immediately is referred to as anti-Feminism, misogyny, MRIness and a whole host of terrible words.|`|3862H0WVaa	Ah! I was blind and now I can see.<br>  <br>  It's just an old saying!!!|`|pyHF4eYJaa	In many cases aggressive, domineering, and immoral women are using the label of "feminist" to conceal the immoral nature of their actions. I am not at all against equal right. I want equal rights between men and women. But many feminists are not interested in equal rights they just want domination.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	Cool...I'm a rehabilitated feminist, too.<br>  Welcome.|`|iRKOJhYeaa	Hear! Hear!|`|lqI8QZ9Eaa	I totally agree with what you are saying. Its brave of you to say these things because you are bound to lose some feminist friends. But hey, welcome to the 'bad people' gang. The perks aren't so good though. You now have to live in Mom's cellar, have a tiny penis, be a woman beater etc...!|`|pus08YEOaa	I see VAWA like hate crime legislation. But you have to understand, a lot of the laws meant to protect women assert that we are defenseless or a special class and isn't consistent with feminism. A lot of laws against men hurt women, too. Like in custody cases, ignoring good fathers and siding predominantly with the woman promotes the maternal instinct myth, that women's highest qualification is as a mother. Isn't that the same logic that has some people arguing that a "woman's place is with her children" and not the workforce?<br>  <br>  If men have full custody, they deserve child support payments from the delinquent parent like any woman would. But most of those mothers are deemed unfit, unlike fathers who are more often than not just disinterested in parenting. It depends on the particular case and cannot be decided across the board. Child support shouldn't be default anyway, as many women who remarry to a wealthier spouse continue receiving the same payments as before. It's a necessary evil but should be re-examined.<br>  <br>  I think it's very important not to let a few loud women who are overcompensating for past abuses to hijack the movement. It disappoints me to hear so many women say, "I'm not a feminist, but I believe in equality." On one hand, good, that equality isn't up for debate, but it's so sad that they think the feminist movement goes further than that. It is important to keep the moderate women on the inside and not leave the movement to become a shell of its former self.

But, then I got to thinking, that I don't want to look back at my college years (this occured during my sophomore and junior year of college) with sadness, but rather with pride that I was able to overcome a rough patch. Basically, I turned to writing to get all my feelings out and it helped tremendously. I'm not even saying to write poems or songs, just write down all the feelings that are inside you, even the ones deep inside that you are trying to repress. It will help tremendously. I am much better now, and if I do ever get into a sad and/or negative phase, writing always helps. Try it, trust me, it can only do more good than bad. Hope this helps, and try to look at the bright side of life!

The discussion is based upon accumulated diary records of chimpanzees, descriptions of individual animals, and records of behavior. It is concluded that "recognition of a full, characteristic expression of emotion is the classification of a deviation of behavior from an habitual base line . . . . The recognition of emotion otherwise is a discrimination of a state of changed responsiveness detected from 'associated signs.' . . . " These emotions are inferred special states. There is no fundamental difference in recognition of emotion in man and animals. The "ultimate criteria of the various emotions are found in distinctions of overt behavior." The failure "to obtain a reliable recognition of emotions in the laboratory experiments of the last thirty years was the result of a particular experimental procedure." 21 references.

hHSsMyNpaa	Its good that people want you to be a better person than what they are seeing.  They love you.  Just know that, but don't be too hard on yourself either.

It may be so that they thus half-consciously awkwardly project their own painful difficulties upon you, and that you are their test-person for a possible way to a solution to their own problems. In that way they sort of indirectly or unconsciously go through their own difficulties or shortcomings, unconsciously heading towards a yet unknown break-through so that they perhaps better can learn how to manage their own life.<br>  <br>  So, you might try and be less sloppy or less slovenly in your own life, if what those critical people are referring to about you is the same as this.<br>  <br>  For you, it may be a simple matter of improving your own life, of wanting to become more diligent, more alert, more astute, and eating better healthier food, retiring for the night never much later than midnight and peacefully remaining in your own bed for let's say six or seven hours until morning.<br>  <br>  Also, you might try and do some magic breathing exercises of your own contrivance or learnt from somebody else. You might do some sport for medals, or work that will demand lots of discipline and of perspiring exertion.<br>  <br>  On the whole, you might try and ardently say to yourself that you want to be more diligent, more careful at whatever you are doing or are supposed to do, and that your own holy aim has to be about working at building up, or adding to, some good glowing memories for a future.<br>  <br>  Have a merry laugh.

I prefer that over hormone treatment and it is effective as well as reversible.  In essence birth control has already been around for us. The only difference is that it is semi-permanent.<br>  <br>  A pill would make it more convenient for men in their younger years who are unresolved on whether they want children. They would have to develop one with minimal side effects however.<br>  <br>  EDit-<br>  <br>   If a guy's own birth control failed I imagine he would be more willing to take  more personal responsibility in supporting the child financially all- beit begrudingly if he's not too thrilled about being a parent.  This would take the "it's her fault argument out of the equation".  A man with any sense of decency would beat himself up for a fews days and then get over it and get on with meeting his obligations.|`|xsyAljhaaa	You have to be very careful when administering exogenous testosterone to males. If you do it for too long you may permanently sterilize them, not mention the testicular atrophy that will occur after 3 months. I don't want to have to be on HRT for the rest of my life. Recovery from extended periods of male hormone administration can be a very lengthy and difficult proposition where it takes years to get back to normal production of testosterone, if ever.<br>  <br>  I should also add that the female birth control pill isn't exactly a bed full of roses either. Estradiol is a known carcinogen, but male hormones, which are much safer are practically illegal for all intents and purposes. Manufacturers and doctors discourage smoking while on the pill, because estradiol raises the levels of bad cholesterols, and lowers the levels of the good. Smoking while on the pill can lead to heart disease faster.|`|wkjncmHTaa	I think it's fair for men to have the option to 'financially abort' upon payment of some kind of fee. Birth control isn't perfect and does fail. Having said that, men would have even less incentive to take it than they currently would. There's no way to make this issue completely fair and equal, until methods of birth control improve at least.<br>  <br>  Also I can't really see how a 'financial abortion' would work - who would be responsible for the father knowing about the pregnancy in time to have an abortion, how long would he have to decide etc. etc. It's not as simple as it sounds.|`|V1MptCMiaa	I think there should be birth control for men too since we're the ones that get stuck with a kid if we choose and all they have to do it is pay for it.

That way the child does not have to lack being supported.|`|66tTuuIFaa	Personally I don't think we can ever hope to have reproductive equality when our reproductive systems are different and therefore unequal. You can't give one side rights without slighting the other. The mother will always be the most important figure in a child's life for the nine months gestation and at least the first year of the child's life. There are natural functions a woman can perform that a child needs that men just do not have the capability to perform. <br>  Because of this, no matter how many rights we give men, reproductive rights will be unequal in favor of women until we make such advances in science that allows a fetus to grow outside of a mother's womb and allows a man to enjoy the same biological functions as a woman.<br>  I'm in favor of allowing men as many reproductive rights as we can(financial abortion, male pill, etc.) but unfortunately I don't ever see it being the true 50-50 that most want.

A psychologist has a Ph.D. in psychology (typically clinical psychology). A counselor can have a variety of degrees. For example, they could have a masters or doctorate in psychology, counseling, or social work.
47avjWrhaa	Oh! I'm sorry that this happened to you.  I understand how you feel.  It happend to me quite often to me before.  <br>  <br>  If you really want to get that grade that you deserve, maybe you could consult your lecturer about what had happened.  I gaurentee they will give you the credit that you deserve.  And next time, try to be a little more assertive.  Dont worry about 'ruining your relationship' with a friend.  If they were a true friend, they would not take advantage of you.  Maybe the problem here really is that you chose the wrong people to work with.  Perhaps next time choose someone more responsible.  Someone that will help you earn the grade you deserve.  <br>  <br>  And please do not be depressed over this!  Things happen, that's just how it goes.  On the bright side of all this you learned that next time you should choose your partner a little more wisely.  however if you happen to get stuck with a partner that's lazy and does not do the work, make sure you makei t clear to them that you will NOT allow them to be lazy and not do work.  Tell them that if they take advantage of you, you will be sure not to be working with them again.  Or threaten to tell your professor if they do.<br>  <br>  But my overall suggestion is to let your lecturer know that you deserve the credit.<br>  <br>  I hope this works out for you<br>  <br>  *best wishes to you :)*|`|6GNqMJB4aa	Well, that is a situation that I know a whole lot about.  People like your friend are the kind of people who tick me off and that I never want to work with when it comes to group assignments.  If I were you, I would let the lecturer know exactly what happened while you were getting the assignment completed.  At this point, I'm sorry, but I would not care too much about this friend.  The most important thing is for you to get credit for the work that you did.  Next time this happens, make sure you stick up for yourself becuase believe me, other people will take advantage of your willingness to care about their well being, but they won't do the same for you.

YQOT68xFaa	Strong independent men are the spawn of satan. They are labelled "macho" and then spit on contemptuously. <br>  <br>  And the only way a woman can be strong and independent is if she's got a career and has the "you're a grown man, take care of yourself! wash your own laundry! cook your own food! blah blah blah" attitude. <br>  <br>  Annoying, eh?<br>  <br>  Nobody is truly independent. Those women may not "depend" on their husbands (they do, actually, but don't know it), but they depend on their boss for their livelihood. They depend on their childcare provider to do a good job raising their children in their stead. *shrugs* Don't sound "independent" to me. They've just farmed out their dependency to someone other than their spouse.<br>  <br>  <br>  "The strong, independent woman demands respect. She'll get what she wants, despite the fact that she's a woman. She doesn't accept traditional roles when they conflict with her inner desires."<br>  <br>  She should *earn* respect and not demand it, and she should remember she doesn't have to be aggressive or pushy to get what she wants. Think Ivanka Trump. Now there is one classy independent woman!  : )|`|oVeGMNsLaa	I like strong, independent men, too.  But then again, I also like people who are open, vulnerable, and who admit to needing others, emotionally.<br>  <br>  What can I say, I like all types!|`|Qnswjc6kaa	Feminism does not address the strong independent man because he is already ingrained in our culture. Traditionally, men are supposed to be strong and independent, while women must be vulnerable and dependent on others, particularly men.<br>  <br>  Before feminism, these stereotypes were heavily reinforced by societal norms. For instance, before the 1970's, most women did not work. If a women is not working, she is dependent on her husband for income. Feminism eradicated this by encouraging more women to enter the work force. They can support themselves, and they don't "need" anyone. They don't have to marry for money, and if they want a divorce, they can get it and know their children won't go starving. Although women are still paid less than men, they have proven that they are not weak or mentally inferior, as previously thought.<br>  <br>  The reason feminists are so angry is because of old stereotypes, as I just mentioned above. Men may not realize it, but even today women are not given equal respect. For instance, my mother takes my brother to the hospital. The nurse brushes her off as a panicky paranoid mother. My father takes my brother to the emergency room. He is seen immediately. Men are taken much more seriously. Women are "moody", "bitchy", etc. Some women are, but these terms are thrown around much too often in order to brush women aside.<br>  <br>  The strong, independent woman demands respect. She'll get what she  wants, despite the fact that she's a woman. She doesn't accept traditional roles when they conflict with her inner desires. Not all women are nurturing and vulnerable. Those who aren't shouldn't be forced into a matriarchal role.|`|8s3rMWojaa	Well most sure don't open their pie holes wide and brag about it whilst trying to ridicule the slightly less successful creatures of the opposite sex =)|`|ibaLRXY2aa	Men are already assumed to be strong and independent.

I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for women.

They are the ones who took the word "sex" and replaced it with "gender." In this way they separated the general characteristics of each sex from their biological reality. Then the rest of the homosexuals, or is that homogenderals, expanded it from the erroneous implication that males and females only act as they do due to socialization, to somehow being up to four "genders." [No one would buy into there being four sexes.] That legitimizes men-in-women's bodies, etc. So now the lesbians, also known as radical feminists, can usurp the masculine role, and be men without actually having sex-reassignment surgery, or is that gender-reassignment surgery. I think it is nothing but genderism, but maybe some did this to lessen genderal harrassment. IMO they have only confused things and made the situation worse.

mVTGl6HGaa	Sometimes direct interventions involve physical force (e.g. by family members or friends) to capture or confine the targeted person. Typically a government-licensed psychotherapist is involved. Indeed, the government's involvement prevents the intervention from comprising a crime, such as battery or kidnapping. For it is common knowledge that government workers are unable to commit any crime. In such cases the person has (usually) neither been served with any legal action alleging the necessity of intervention, nor had the opportunity to appear in court to defend against the proposed intervention. Civil libertarians argue that when the government is involved in forcible intervention, the intervention is unconstitutional (and therefore illegal, regardless of any statute that "authorizes" it) because it deprives the person of liberty without due process of law.

5c907c92a6c7447ccb431133ac7208abaa	1) This is a great 2008 book about how gender differences affect both men and women: "The Gender Gap in College: Maximizing the Developmental Potential of Women and Men" by Linda J Sax. An article about the book states we're making too simplistic an assumption about men/women and college enrollments:<br>  <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2008/10/13/gender" rel="nofollow">http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2008/...</a><br>  <br>  "With women making up solid majorities of undergraduate enrollments nationally, and more than 60 percent at many institutions, gender gaps are a hot topic -- but the focus has been on why female numbers are up and male numbers aren't. Linda J. Sax says that's only part of the equation. <br>  <br>  Sax, an associate professor of education at the University of California at Los Angeles, says it is time to focus on the ways men and women experience higher education and why some experiences help either men or women but not both. The emphasis on the total enrollment figures hides real issues facing men and women in college."<br>  <br>  2) Another interesting research study written in 2006 about the Gender Gap comes from three Harvard economists. They found many different reasons why women and men's college enrollments have varied since 1930. Here's the article about the study: "New Take on the Gender Gap": <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2006/04/26/gender" rel="nofollow">http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2006/...</a><br>  <br>  According to the researchers: "So why today’s imbalance? The Harvard economists suggest several factors. One is that changes in societal values have meant that more women -- across social classes -- hold jobs for significant portions of their adult lives, or their entire adult lives. The wage differential between college-educated and non-college educated woman has always been greater than that for men, the authors write. Women are behaving with economic logic by focusing more on college, since they will spend more of their lifetimes working." <br>  <br>  3) This article agrees with the later findings of the Harvard economists: This is from a 2001 article that disputes the claim that there is a college gender gap crisis at all: <a href="http://www.virtuallyadvising.com/content/wic/11gendergap.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.virtuallyadvising.com/content...</a> <br>  <br>  The article points out that the same number of men are going to college as in the past-it's just that women are going to college in larger numbers as the jobs they can get right of high school are still low-paying, unlike the jobs men can get right out of high school. So the wage gap is forcing women to go to college to be able to make what male high school grads make..here's from the article titled "Virtual Advising: Women in College: The Gender Gap Grows: <br>  <br>  "In October, the American Council on Education issued a report entitled "Gender Equity in Higher Education: Are Male Students at a Disadvantage?" The report, written by Jacqueline King, director of ACE's Center for Policy Analysis, examined the reasons why women currently outnumber men on college campuses. Here's the report:<br>  <a href="http://74.6.239.67/search/cache?ei=UTF-8&p=Gender+Equity+in+Higher+Education%3A+Are+Male+Students+at+a+Disadvantage%3F%22&fr=moz2-ytff-tyc&u=www.acenet.edu/bookstore/pdf/2000_gender_equity.pdf&w=gender+equity+higher+education+male+students+student+disadvantage+disadvantages&d=OI6_Jp2uSQKm&icp=1&.intl=us" rel="nofollow">http://74.6.239.67/search/cache?ei=UTF-8...</a><br>  <br>  King found that, despite the trend toward a greater proportion of female enrollees, there is no educational crisis among men. King acknowledged, however, that "there are pockets of real problems."<br>  <br>  Her study showed that the number of male students in college has remained relatively stable since 1975, but the number of women rose from 5 million in 1975 to 8 million in 1997. King reported that, although more women are enrolled in both public and private colleges nationwide, "These statistics . mask tremendous differences by academic level, age, race/ethnicity, and income."<br>  <br>  The largest disparity is present among families earning less than $30,000, where 68 percent of college enrollees are women. "While both male and female low-income students tend to be less well-prepared for college . male low-income students have some ability in this strong economy to make a decent living with just a high-school diploma," King said. As long as the economy is strong, fields like construction will continue to offer good jobs, according to King.<br>  <br>  However, she said, "For women, the typical jobs for a high-school graduate are not nearly as good." Most jobs for women with high-school degrees are "pink collar," or service jobs such as retail sales that rarely pay above the minimum wage. "Low-income women are forced by the job market to overcome their academic disadvantages and pursue some type of postsecondary degree," King said. "<br>  <br>  In addition, King had an interesting assessment: "She pointed out, however, that this gender gap does not exist on all levels of higher education. Men currently hold the majority in the two largest fields for master's degrees: business and engineering."<br>  <br>  King also pointed out that minority males are the ones less likely to attend college...|`|AA11589988	This Christina Hoff-Sommers book could be useful to you.<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/War-Against-Boys-Misguided-Feminism/dp/0684849569" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/War-Against-Boys-M...</a>|`|NNHdkLDWaa	Easy, plumber, welder deep sea oil rig maintainance builder mechanik, soldier, are many of the professions where few women are, so a percentage of women decides to go to college instead of doing one of the mentioned professions.

X4FQBmo9aa	The judge would probably give joint custody.  The break would probably be 4 days with mother, 3 days with the father.  Despite the polarizing beliefs of the parents and the equal split of time and responsibilities during the marriage, statistically the judge would probably still lean towards the mother getting the "better deal" of the custody agreement.  Fair or not, as long as a mother isn't blatantly unfit, they tend to be favored in family court.  <br>  <br>  The children themselves will probably need therapy.  I'm not trying to be flip or comedic when saying that, its a simple truth.  The kids will need to find their own way.  Being twins, perhaps they can help each other out.  Maybe find a balance between the two extremes their parents presented.

This diminishes somewhat as they get to know you.  The way you want her to get to know you is by observing that you do a good job, not by talking to her.  There is no point in talking to her as she is not going to be truthful with you about anything.  Because at the beginning before she knows you, she is not going to show her cards.  Just don't think about her and don't interact with her and if you do the job well and if you stay, after awhile it will smooth out.  But it could take a few months.

Xq9iLKoIaa	Mostly like modern Eastern Europeans. The mutations for very pale skin, blue eyes and very blond hair wouldn't have reached out to the North Caucasus/steppes are that long ago, so they would have been a shade darker. Most of the crania from that area are  more Nordic in shape (long skulls, strong faces with high cheekbones), with a certain percentage looking more like mediterranean people with smaller faces and rounder skulls.<br>  <br>  Mongoloid people hadn't really made it that far West by that era. They are a relatively recent phenotype in Asia, only dating back about 7,000 BP (so far)<br>  <br>  The proto Indo European language descirbes a technology that is bronze age, with wheels, horses and plenty of terms for construction/houses and boats. They were probably living in small towns and villages, with a thriving agriculture. It's possible the combination of the wheel and horse enable their culture to spread out rather spectacularly from the area to the north of the Caucasus all over the place; starting from about 5,000 to 4,800 BP<br>  <br>  See blog for a little info on PIE.<br>  <a href="http://mathildasanthropologyblog.wordpress.com/2009/01/31/horses-apples-and-proto-indo-european/" rel="nofollow">http://mathildasanthropologyblog.wordpre...</a><br>  <br>  The Maykop/Maikop culture was a very early Indo European culture, so it would probably help you to look it up. Also you might want to look up the Kura-Araxes culture and Sinshasta cultures for a feel for the PIE people.<br>  <br>  Kura-Araxes..<br>  <a href="http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/enwiki/480063" rel="nofollow">http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/enwiki/48...</a><br>  They built mud-brick houses, originally round, but later developing into a square design. The economy was based on farming and livestock-raising. They grew grain and various orchard crops, and are known to have used implements to make flour. They raised cattle, sheep, goats, dogs, and in its later phases, horses.<br>  <br>  Their pottery was distinctive. It was painted black and red, using geometric designs for ornamentation. Examples have been found as far south as Syria and Israel, and as far north as Dagestan and Chechnya. The spread of this pottery, along with archaeological evidence of invasions, suggests that the Kura-Araxes people may have spread outward from their original homes, and most certainly, had extensive trade contacts. <br>  <br>  Their metal goods were widely distributed, recorded in the Volga, Dnieper and Don-Donets systems in the north, into Syria and Palestine in the south, and west into Anatolia. The culture is closely linked to the approximately contemporaneous Maykop culture of Transcaucasia. They are also remarkable for the production of wheeled vehicles (wagons and carts).<br>  <br>  Inhumation practices are mixed. Flat graves are found, but so are substantial kurgan burials, the latter of which may be surrounded by cromlechs. This points to a heterogeneous ethno-linguistic population. Hurrian and Urartian elements are quite probable. One can also argue for at least an outpost of an early Semitic language, and certainly the presence of an early representative of the Kartvelian languages is not unreasonable. An influence of Indo-European languages was also likely present.<br>  <br>  In the Armenian hypothesis of Indo-European origins, this culture (and perhaps that of the Maykop culture) is identified with the speakers of the Anatolian languages|`|Qt3Zqfviaa	u cant look middle eastern since they are not a race, they can be black white mongoloid etc.<br>  <br>  they looked white european even though they orginally were middle eaternerns.|`|T1beLIQqaa	They looked something like the Iranians/Persians or the Tamils of India.|`|9ZQnd2rmaa	Not too different than today,generally  European looking I'd imagine, probably brown haired rather than really fair but there probably was some diversity in hair/eye colour.

zQnf0knLaa	Why didn't you post this question in Japan category ? I believe you could get more answers.<br>  <br>  Well I think YES.And it is more complicated thing than people living outside of Japanese society guess.I think you know what I mean since you are living in Japan.I don't think Japanese man want their society to be male dominant but you know those spoiled Japanese girls makes it difficult to have gender equality in a real meaning.Japanese man are still socially pressured to be a bread winner of a family and being jobless means being a loser of his life while women are not.See how Japanese man are accepting to be insulted and to complement women in TV or other media.The problem is Japanese woman are not finding it a problem.It's the same for how kids are tolerated to be annoying.Women used to work hard as a house wife and had a pride for it you know our grandma got up at 4 and started their work every morning.Now everything has changed and too many girls say they want to find a husband and retire from their job and get a laid back life.We don't see any big inequality in our school life until we become a 社会人 but we face it after our 20's.<br>  I was shocked to hear a girl tell me "becoming a house wife is woman's dream" when I was in a Uni because I was believing almost all girls wanted gender equal society in 21st cen. and they were supposed to work like man do.Now my idea has changed.Japan needs healthy sustainable society that requires each civilians to have a healthy family that can raise at least a few kids.I've got lost in my opinion now....haha <br>  Well I believe Japanese girls are spoiled to work in this strict work ethics society but we need more relaxing life so it's sort of a dilemma.<br>  <br>  Sorry for my messed up post but I don't have a gut to rewrite it now.And please keep it in mind if you refer to gender inequality in Japan you should have both perspective from man and woman.I believe becoming house husband will never be socially accepted in Japan and if a woman want to compete with a man who works so hard that may cost her life as a mother.Our social style is not stable so far and it's so complicated even we want to adjust it.|`|MrtQuBBJaa	Gender inequality cross cultural and is pervasive in every society.

I totally am not a girly girl and it's just how I feel. I don't like attracting men in that way. I just don't. I still like men, but feel very uncomfortable to wear really girly clothes. I just think that some people crave dressing girly and others want to dress whatever the opposite is and that would totally be a flannel. I think too that women who like to wear flannels tend to be more interested in doing "manly" activities like working on a car or woodworking and those type clothes are much better suited for wearing something like a flannel.|`|cJAf4pU0aa	I don't know, but I believe they call them lesbians and the males are the ones called homosexuals.<br>  I don't quite get the flannel thing.|`|sfn6SpbCaa	Celtish I once knew a lesbian and the last thing she wore was flannel; she always wore these real nice looking male dress shirts and pants; and not one hair was ever out of place.

Lesbian is a word thats been used for female homosexuals for years, and thats what most people take it as. From Lesbos, home of the lesbian ;)<br>  <br>  And some are, some arent. I think the attraction for gay women to wear flannel, cut their hair etc is mainly so that other gay women know they're gay. Similar with gay men who have that lisping accent (no disrespect!) - it signals to other gay people that you are one of them, and therefore it is easier for someone of the same sex to approach you romantically.

WtsV0gakaa	Although you are a shy person, I think it's great that you're taking a step by asking online for some help.  I do hope that you continue to reach out (with assistance) to that you can help others as well as yourself. <br>  <br>  That being said, I would first look into your strengths.  If you are good with computers, there's a variety of options: data entry, online website moderator, website graphics designer, online "fix it" person (can't think of the technical name), running a home business, work-at-home for another company, just to name a few.<br>  <br>  If you have the courage and qualifications, you can look into being a tutor or mentor for elementary through high school students.  Some schools may even offer an online option in which you can communicate with students that way.  <br>  <br>  Hope this gives you some ideas.|`|7Vi8k2TMaa	I feel you should seek treatment for the social anxiety and not limit yourself to a job that fits a disorder. And you can get over it, I lived with it all my life until I entered college and a professional noticed and helped me. IT will change<br>  <br>  <br>  I know from personal experience what it's like trying to find a job based on my social phobia disorder. And it's hard, and not necessary if you can get treatment for the disorder. Not only will you not limit yourself, you will feel better as a whole and find out new things about yourself. If it IS pathological, your shyness may not be a part of your personality. And you could find out that you'd rather be in a career dealing with people all the time.|`|3FerQ9Ehaa	You can be a night time security guard in a building that's open 24hrs/day like a condominium complex or an office building.|`|MyKUT9Enaa	look at midnight shifts you interact with others alot less|`|lpeOwnGRaa	Computer programming.<br>  <br>  But, hun, social anxiety isn't the end of the world.

From here you can set your settings. <br>  "Ratings" tab - Set rating levels for: language, nudity, sex and violence. <br>  <br>  "Approved Sites" tab - Name sites that you will allow your children to always view or name sites that you never want your children to view, regardless of the site's rating. <br>  <br>  "General" tab <br>  Allow or disallow your child to see sites that are not rated. <br>  Create a password - this is great for use with older children. You set a password, then if your child goes to a site they want to see, but it is a disallowed site, you can allow the site using the password. You will have the option to always allow the site or only allow it this one time. <br>  View or modify the rating system <br>  Also, I don't know how tech savvy your kids are, but you should regularly check the browsing history..in internet expoler 7, all the way on the left hand side is a gold star. click on it and it will  open a menu. click on history, it comes after feeds, and it will show all the sites that they have visited. You can see history for the entire week. Then block the sites from there by adding them to the list like I said.  doesnt cost a dime. Now they might already be deleting thier history so you don't see where they have been so dont be surprised if it's empty! But...there is a way that you can block them from deleteing the browsing history so you can see everything they do online and see what kind of files they download. hahaha!

Only self control is the answer and a wisdom to select the subject to be watched or visited the sites.<br>  And the wisdom comes from family environment, company what we have ( friends/ relatives and so on), and facilities we have.

Science is simply a system of empirically understanding the world, where we take observable data and develop patterns from the results.  Psychology is definitely a science.
P9oP8CS9aa	Find a really good cause and volunteer to work with people. Those in need will be very appreciative and build your self confidence and give you something to talk to strangers about. The volunteer experience with teach you social skills and get rid of the negative energy flow you are sending out now.|`|0F8hauikaa	It's hard to say without knowing more about you. You might study people that are well liked and imitate their qualities, which are often being a good listener and making the other person feel important. Try not to talk about yourself or your problems too much as that will make you appear self-absorbed, which will push people away sometimes. Try to adopt a positive attitude about life and count your blessings rather than being negative. You're lucky to have grandparents. Mine died when I was young and I didn't get to know them very well. You might also take up a new hobby where you can meet people with common interests. Volunteering was an excellent suggestion.|`|ewgDtqD3aa	you are not alone here at least you have grandparent, someone there for you. i lost my grandparent, lost my mom and dad. i been living a lone since i was 15 years old now in my mid 20s. i know how you feel but you can tell your grandparent that you want to join a club like volunteering, or sport you want to try or yoga or whatever really and you will meet people.<br>  you will be fine|`|RTVkXnavaa	are u looking sharp? - hair, clothes? <br>  r u an ethnic minority? if so then it may not be all ur fault.<br>  Slick talker?|`|cHkH7ESuaa	How old are you?  Are you a guy or a girl?  These are important questions.<br>  <br>  It's hard to make friends in life, it just is.  People can be very judgemental and two faced and selfish.  Ugh, I deal with crap and drama with my friends all the time.  Sometimes we're "best friends" and other times they completely ditch me on a Saturday night.  Sometimes I adore them and then sometimes I can tell they're ignoring me, or treating me like the "back-up plan". <br>  <br>  Just like you, I've had people in my life that no longer talk to me.  Both times it was over stupid boy drama, but the sad part is that these were people I considered best friends, and now they're gone.<br>  <br>  Wow, ok sorry, this is kind of a depressing response!!<br>  <br>  Anyway, there are definitely ways to meet new people.  Have you ever heard of a website called www.meetup.com?  No, it's not a dating website.  It's actually just tons of groups of people that get together to make new friends and share common interests.<br>  <br>  For example, there are groups who get together to play boardgames, or go hiking, or play tennis, or watch star trek even, seriously!  In fact one of the groups is specifically for people that are shy and/or have social anxiety.  They get together and go to coffee and stuff!  <br>  <br>  I don't know where you live but if you check out that website, you'll see there are meetups all across the country.  Just check it out, OK?<br>  <br>  And by the way - when I feel sad sometimes, like I'm losing people from my life, my self-confidence goes into the toilet.  The trick is to reclaim it.  Something I do that works wonders for me is simply getting outside and moving my body.  Like running, biking.  I mean, even walking is good!<br>  <br>  But for sure check out that website.|`|lwG6tvOqaa	I relate to this question so much, minus the whole being friends with your sister and living with your grandparents thing.<br>  <br>  Overcoming shyness can be very hard, almost impossible. I am trying to heal from it myself, and i am actually getting a little better. Going from shy and quiet to being a  social butterfly is a big jump. However, i have realized that shyness isn't really the issue anymore. The real problem is insecurity, which is even harder to deal with sometimes.<br>  <br>  One thing that has helped me is to know what kind of people that i click best with. I make friends/actaintances with them first, we share some laughs, and then that gives me the confidence that i need to branch out and meet new people that i wouldn't ordinarily hang with. They say don't judge a book by its cover, and that is partly true. Some of the people that may be classified as "weird", "loser","nerdy", or whatever usually end up being my friend, and very good friend at that. Sometimes, i can bring an ordinarily quiet/shy person out of their shell, and they do the same for me without realizing it. It is a great feeling when you connect with a person like that. <br>  <br>  If you keep connecting with people like that, then it will be easier to do it in the futurem and you may become a social butterfly like i am sure that you want to be. Just don't try to force yourself to be someone that you are not. Then you may come across as fake or look like you are trying to hard. IM me if you want more info, or if you just want to talk.|`|AA10717478	OKay homie. im prob not gonna have the best answer but its worth a shot. has anyone told u that mayb ur just too negative? negative people seem to never look on the bright side. mayb u should try to be more happyish. or mayb u could just be too clingy. i happened to know that Nobody likes a clingy person. try staying cool. a joining a conservation only when neccesary, <br>  or maybe u could stop being weird.

So stop looking at people as friends just because they do a report with you and consider them competition.  Have a little confidence in  yourself, you know what  you did be proud of what you do. Something else will come into your life and you will be blessed many times over but you have to stop putting yourself down.|`|trMsK86jaa	nice guys only finish last because they attract douchebags like a magnet.<br>  <br>  It's true.|`|YymOCkWQaa	Tell the teacher seperately when you are alone with her.

Damn! People who let themselves get taken advantage of, SHOULD be taken advantage up! Stand up for yourself, you can't just expect someone to jump up and do it for you. <br>  <br>  Anyway, you say it's too late now. But if you can't get it off your mind, you should at least take steps to get it off your chest. Tell your friend that you did all the hard work, and it hurt your feelings when she took "all the credit.) If keeping your relationship in tact is your main purpose, however, I don't suggest accusing her of anything. Just casually bring up the subject, or even write her a note? <br>  <br>  If you can't do that, then you're just going to have to learn to deal. :/<br>  <br>  Best of luck~

A focus that you see every day. Only you know what the goals are but, everyone who desires to overcome all obstacles has the same learning tool. A self made poster of the goal we desire. You place it on a wall in the hall way, next to the TV, on the refrigerator, above the bed.... somewhere you will see it everyday! After awhile you will see this in your dreams, your day dreams will include this image, and your focus will be pin pointed to your goals!|`|qkeF7wmiaa	This is called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).  You can ask yourself questions until you can't ask anymore.  For example, if you have low self-esteem issues and look at your stomach and think, eww disgusting, then you might ask your self, why do I think that is disgusting, then you might say because it does not look like that famous person, then you might say how much does that famous person devote to getting that way.  Just question negative or unhelpful thoughts until you get to a point in which your thoughts change towards more productive, realistic and hopefuly ideas.  Goodluck and we could all work on this : )

They hit you from every angle to eliminate daily impacts to get to the core personality. The problem is that therapists are human too!

7aK81hsbaa	thinking we have all answers closes our minds to new ideas. i've done this and created problems where there were none, because i thought i had the answers. unfortunately, i didn't know the right questions. yes, you can be too intelligent for your own good!<br>  good question = star!|`|9DYiyQbGaa	Yes, you can make good decisions and not take people's feelings into account. <br>  Ex. An intelligent person would always make good business decisions. So if you are with this company, but you know it's best that you leave, for better stocks somewhere else. Eventhough you just made a good decision, you left some good people behind. It could ruin the trust that people have in you, and you could end up a miserable millionaire if you have a conscience. Also the popular company could drop in finance oneday, and the company left behind could rise. So don't try to run back to the other company when they are on top, after you destroyed the relationship.<br>  Intelligence is different from wisdom.|`|8szjUHdsaa	It can be that someone would become complacent not having to ask questions (to other people).

1d87d68d27feaf630ac18e418360ae11aa	The thing to remember is that if you never try something, you'll never know if you will succeed or not. If you do fail at something, it doesn't mean that you can't try again. Learn from the mistakes you made the first try and keep working to improve your skills until you succeed. It's better to try and fail than to never try at all. Many of the most successful people in our world and in history failed several times before succeeding. In my opinion, a failure is someone who has never taken a chance at all to accomplish a goal because of the fear of failure. At least be willing to try, learn and try again. It's the only way we learn and grow.|`|47avjWrhaa	You have to convince yourself that you'll suceed.  Be positive, just tell yourself that you're going to be okay, that you're going to achieve what needs to be achieved.  If you're positive, positive things will happen, however if you're negative, then negative things will happen.  It's the law of attraction buddy.  <br>        But never have a fear of failure,  Remember, even if you do not achieve the task you wanted to achieve, it doesnt mean you have failed.  It means you have to get up and keep trying again, and again.  There's a first time for everything, good or bad.  And sometimes bad things are good.  I was always told, with bad comes good.  You'll learn from your mistakes next time you come across a problem like that.  <br>  <br>  Never Let The Fear Of Striking Out Keep You From Playing The Game.|`|GfNVcq7Naa	Fear of failure is far worse than failure itself. <br>  <br>  You must also be highly critical of other people if you are so critical of yourself. Try to be more understanding. <br>  <br>  Passing tests means nothing if you don't understand the why we are being tested.|`|8szjUHdsaa	By realizing how finite time really is.|`|vvPL4f4Faa	Try, try again.  The more you try the more likly you will be successful and that overcomes the fear.|`|HPqCRBq8aa	One way is to stop looking at things in that matter. Success and failure. Conditioned yourself to try to look at things like every exit is an entrance to something else.

glRSKBNfaa	Yes, with the economy the way it is two things that are preventing you from getting a job are occuring:<br>  1) Companies are letting go marginal workers, those who contribute the least amount to the company, as a 16 year-old, you probably have little or no experience and only a high school education, so you will end up being in this marginal worker group.<br>  <br>  2) with unemployment at 8.1%, there is a surplus of workers who have more experience (and many with more education) than you who are looking for the same jobs.  Companies hire people who will maximize their profits, and a person who has 20 years on the job will beat you out for the job.

You know some people enjoy watching other people and their reactions.<br>  You say she is older and married, she probably has not made it a habit to flirt or she likely would not be older and married. Sometimes people like seeing what people will do to create a relationship. You know spare time in the office.

No. 2 she probably is sussing out your feelings. It is very unlikely she'd draw attention to other womens' attraction to the man if SHE fancies him, unless it's twisted and she is jealous of you, so trying to make you feel bad about the women all over him, as shes married and cant have him anyway.|`|xmibEEdcaa	E.

That would be like convincing her you are a troll.|`|1nM56bFkaa	Bummer... My mum's overprotective like that. It will blow over soon I bet,but if the worst comes to the worst, tell her the truth and see if she buys it, however embarassing it might be.|`|F9D7OZejaa	I think that you need to consider your mother. She is the one that raised you and she experiences discomfort because of you. Tell her the truth and if she does not buy it than I suggest you humor her sense it would ease the worry you inflicted on her.<br>  <br>  Thinking of other people isn't hard, its sacrificing things for them.|`|4zscfvvoaa	It is a lot easier to have your parents believe you on things, when you don't lie to them.  When you lie, and sneak around, their not going to believe anything you say.<br>  <br>  Looks like you have quite the punishment though.  Snuck out of the house once and now you can never go to any ones house.  You really got the short end of the stick on that one.<br>  <br>  You are going to have to start respecting your parents.  I know that is about the worst advice I can give.  Hell, when I was young I did things.  I even did worse things then what you are talking about.  I was smart though.  I got away with stuff.  Either learn to tell your parents the truth (recommended) or become very good at lying to them (this is the less desirable option).<br>  <br>  Remember that your parents are a hugh part of your life.  They will be their even after that boyfriend is gone.  They will be their when you get married.  They will be their (god forbid) when you get divorced.  Building a good relationship with them really makes a huge difference on your life.

The fact that you need to keep quite a neat appearance suggests this, with the braided hair and fact that you're clean shaved. I would say that you do a lot of computer work. Firstly this is due to your build (no offense meant by this you're in good shape) but you don't appear to be in the top athletic condition with a six pack kind of body, suggesting that you're inactive for long periods of a day. Also the fact that you're wearing tinted glasses, from working on a computer myself I know that it strains the eyes to be out in sunlight.<br>  <br>  I would say that you're 26 or 27 as you don't mind casual dress and the title of your photo kind of suggests that you're still single or at least still testing the waters before considering some form of commitment.<br>  <br>  Having said all that i've probably missed the mark completely and managed to offend you.

Pregnancy is already unequal, so it's unfair but necessary that men cannot decide to keep or terminate the fertilized egg/zygote/fetus. You'd basically have a situation where the man's opinion counted more than the woman's. You'd have better luck with paternal child support reform.<br>  <br>  It is up to both sexual partners to accept the consequences and responsibilities of their physical relationship. The insurance you've suggested is superfluous.|`|PILm2U4Taa	The idea presents no interest to me, but I applaud your "outside the box" thinking...|`|fDGPbwdsaa	Women already 'get out of jail free' cards. Not just in the form of maternity, just look how they are dealt with in regards crimes - Mary Winkler got 60some days for pre-meditated murder (and a host of other crimes that were swamped around the murder). <br>  <br>  Women can abort, adopt (out), foster (out), dump (the child) in a bin, etc. - they pretty much can do whatever the Hell they want - and not face an repercussions.<br>  <br>  A man doing any of the above is held in contempt for it - while a woman is sympathised with.<br>  <br>  <br>  I maintain that in the interests of equality, men should have the right to a legal / financial abortion.<br>  <br>  I am fairly certain that if this were an option open to men, there would be a dramatic drop in the number of 'accidental' pregnancies and claims such as "oopsy, i seem to have forgotten my pill today..."<br>  <br>  The reason there is such an abundant number of the above situations is because one side knows they can get free-handouts & force the other half to pay against his will (or willingly, even).<br>  <br>  <br>  Ultimately, what Gaspari says above is spot on. And the vast, vast majority of fathers do support their children (in the many ways of support, not just financial). <br>  <br>  I have three kids - all three were alleged accidents. My focus is on being a part of their lives, not ducking out of financial obligations. However, as one mother sees fit to eliminate my rights as a parent and all that goes with it - I see fit to eliminate her 'need' for money (despite out earning me by a considerable degree).<br>  <br>  <br>  ETA: u????l, you misrepresent what I've said:<br>  <br>  "You'd basically have a situation where the man's opinion counted more than the woman's."<br>  <br>  No, I have not suggested this whatsoever. What I said is that men should have the option to *financially* abort - meaning if he does NOT want a child, he can terminate his rights/ acces/ financial obligations to the child - just like a woman can abort, dump in a bin, foster & adopt the child out (all without teh father's consent/ knowledge).<br>  <br>  Now if women can do those things - then in the name of equality - which feminists pretend to seek - there is no problem with offering men an alternative method.<br>  <br>  His decision to *financially* abort will not result in the death of the child, unlike her decision to abort or dump it in a bin for someone else to find.<br>  <br>  You also said: "It is up to both sexual partners to accept the consequences and responsibilities of their physical relationship."<br>  <br>  Yes, but women DON'T have to - do they!!!|`|e5t6LIBTaa	Well, if the woman just wanted to get pregnant 'as a job' then yes, I would purchase it...but I'd like to trust that many good women don't still do those things these days so normally I wouldn't bother with it because I know myself and I know I am responsible.  I'm not going to get a card that literally says to the child [which is the most important factor here] that the child is a mistake and that the child was never meant to be.  I'd really look like a mule then.|`|kOdTeeXjaa	I don't support that myself as I am against pre-marital sex, but with how twisted "equal rights" has become, nowadays, I think it might happen.|`|xZmepGVUaa	The government can come after you for child support, regardless of whether you waived your right therein.|`|xsyAljhaaa	Oh, you mean something like an ironclad pre-nuptual agreement. The courts ignore those valid contracts, what makes you think that they wouldn't do the same with paternity insurance? Or are you saying that insurance companies would pay the exorbitant child support payments for 18 years? Yeah, they would really go for that. The premiums would probably be something like $100k a year or more, and there would be so much insurance fraud that we the taxpayers would have to "bail out" the entire insurance industry in a very short amount of time.<br>  <br>  If you are having a casual relationship, those are the risks. Don't expect a get out of jail free card.<br>  <br>  Edit: Yes, now that I think about it, $100k does seem ridiculous. I looked up the ave. child support payments, which is around 300/mo. That works out to roughly $65k over 18 years, so I think it would be considerably lower. I think we need an actuary to give us a good estimate. Insurance companies are in the business of making money. Most likely they would pay only a percentage, or have higher mo. fees for better coverage -- like car insurance. When I still drove, I had a $20k car and the insurance was like 2k/year for full coverage. If enough guys got the insurance maybe it could be as low as $1k a year, but you know they would probably charge "high risk" men more i.e., minority men, or men under 25. It might possibly work. Let's just hope if successful the insurance companies don't manage to lobby for laws to make it mandatory to have paternity insurance in order to have "legal" sex before marriage.  I still think ins. fraud would be a major problem though.|`|HIO0yvK0aa	are you preti much saying you want to be able to have sex, get a girl pregnant, then leave her to raise your and her child, while your off having sex with other women?<br>  <br>  just think about that...|`|mCAWxobNaa	I would never purchase such insurance because I don't have any inclination to distance myself from my child; quite the contrary.  If a lady happens to get pregnant I'm more concerned that I retain paternity rights to my child which are routinely in jeopardy as the result of modern Feminism.<br>  <br>  I just don't see pregnancy or a child as an untoward consequence of sex; I see this as a wonderful blessing.

iLOWEJPhaa	Discipline- that's what you need. It's not an "inner personality"; you, like many ( and even me), are lacking in that quality. It's difficult, but you just need to say no. Don't abstain from video games and junk food- just take it in moderation. <br>  <br>  Also, don't feel guilty- that makes you procrastinate more.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|lTUXdbCTaa	It's not your inner personality, it's just you being tempted. God is the only one who can help you with that. You have to be willing to be strong and say no to those desires. For example, I do the same thing alot.

I just have to be strong enough to just close my computer sometimes.<br>  Also, find a family member or friend that can help keep you accountable. And maybe have them hide the video games and stuff for a while. It will help tremendously just to have someone there helping you.
FRE2gov3aa	People get my respect when they prove it to me,just by being open and honest and not shady.I also like to test people too. Like I will say something that I wouldn't normally say and see how they react.<br>  <br>  Something that causes disrespect is lies. No matter who the person is. If I catch someone in a lie it totally loses any kind of respect I ever had and if I care about the person enough (family,boyfriend,close friends) I give them a second chance to redeem themselves.If it's someone that didn't mean much to me before (acquaintances) they should keep their distance from me.|`|ed71a2e7f354d346a0ff1de177befe5faa	I respect people who are kind to others, and those people who listen to you properly.<br>  <br>  I disrespect those who are the opposite!

mVTGl6HGaa	Beekeeping (or apiculture, from Latin apis, bee) is the maintenance of honey bee colonies, commonly in hives, by humans. A beekeeper (or apiarist) keeps bees in order to collect honey and beeswax, for the purpose of pollinating crops, or to produce bees for sale to other beekeepers. A location where bees are kept is called an apiary.<br>  Contents<br>  [hide]<br>  <br>  [edit] History of beekeeping<br>  <br>  [edit] Origins<br>  <br>  Globally, there are more than 20,000 species of wild bees, including many which are solitary or which rear their young in burrows and small colonies, like mason bees and bumblebees. Beekeeping, or apiculture, is concerned with the practical management of the social species of honey bees, which live in large colonies of up to 100,000 individuals. In Europe and America the species universally managed by beekeepers is the Western honey bee (Apis mellifera), which has several sub-species or regional varieties, such as the Italian bee (Apis mellifera ligustica ), European dark bee (Apis mellifera mellifera), and the Carniolan honey bee (Apis mellifera carnica). In the tropics, other species of social bee are managed for honey production, including Apis cerana.<br>  <br>  All of the Apis mellifera sub-species are capable of inter-breeding and hybridizing. Many bee breeding companies strive to selectively breed and hybridize varieties to produce desirable qualities: disease and parasite resistance, good honey production, swarming behaviour reduction, prolific breeding, and mild disposition. Some of these hybrids are marketed under specific brand names, such as the Buckfast Bee or Midnite Bee. The advantages of the initial F1 hybrids produced by these crosses include: hybrid vigor, increased honey productivity, and greater disease resistance. The disadvantage is that in subsequent generations these advantages may fade away and hybrids tend to be very defensive and aggressive.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Wild honey harvesting<br>  <br>  Collecting honey from wild bee colonies is one of the most ancient human activities and is still practiced by aboriginal societies in parts of Africa, Asia, Australia, and South America. Some of the earliest evidence of gathering honey from wild colonies is from rock painting, dating to around 13,000 BC. Gathering honey from wild bee colonies is usually done by subduing the bees with smoke and breaking open the tree or rocks where the colony is located, often resulting in the physical destruction of the colony.<br>  <br>  [edit] Domestication of wild bees<br>  <br>  At some point humans began to domesticate wild bees in artificial hives made from hollow logs, wooden boxes, pottery vessels, and woven straw baskets or "skeps." The domestication of bees was well developed in Egypt and sealed pots of honey were found in the grave goods of Pharaohs such as Tutankhamun. Beekeeping was also documented by the Roman writers Virgil, Gaius Julius Hyginus, Varro, and Columella. Aspects of the lives of bees and beekeeping are discussed at length by Aristotle.<br>  <br>  Archaeologist Amihai Mazar of Jerusalem's Hebrew University said that findings in the ruins of the city of Rehov (with 2,000 residents at that time, Israelites and Canaanites) include 30 intact hives, 900 B.C., and evidence that an advanced honey industry existed in the Holy Land at the time of the Bible or 3,000 years ago. The beehives -- made of straw and unbaked clay-- were found in orderly rows, with 100 hives. Ezra Marcus, expert of Haifa University, said the finding was a glimpse of ancient beekeeping seen in texts and ancient art from the Near East. Religious practice was evidenced by an altar decorated with fertility figurines found alongside the hives.[2] [3]<br>  <br>  [edit] Study of honey bees<br>  <br>  For several thousand years of human beekeeping, human understanding of the biology and ecology of bees was very limited and riddled with superstition and folklore. Ancient observers thought that the queen bee was in fact a male, called "the king bee," and they had no understanding of how bees actually reproduced. It was not until the 18th century that European natural philosophers undertook the scientific study of bee colonies and began to understand the complex and hidden world of bee biology. Preeminent among these scientific pioneers were Swammerdam, René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur, Charles Bonnet, and the blind Swiss scientist Francois Huber. Swammerdam and Réaumur were among the first to use a microscope and dissection to understand the internal biology of honey bees. Réaumur was among the first to construct a glass walled observation hive to better observe activities within hives. He observed queens laying eggs in open cells, but still had no idea of how a queen was fertilized; nobody had ever witnessed the mating of a queen and drone and many theories held that queens were "self-fertile," while others believed that a vapor or "miasma" emanating from the drones fertilized queens without direct physical contact. Huber was the first to prove by observation and experiment that queens a

Obtain a mind numbing hobby that drives you insane and makes you angry, like learning to play music, and you have to deal with anger.  I know it sounds odd, but it will make you angry more often to struggle through the learning process of music, hence making you deal with the anger.

ucoiQPQPaa	1. Behaviorism<br>  <br>  Popular in the early 20th century, behaviorism arose largely in opposition to the dominant psychoanalytic school of thought and the time, that emphasized the role of the subconscious and mental processes as determinants of personality. Behaviorists declared the mind to metaphysical to be studied empirically, and focused instead on the effects that external stimuli had on behavior. <br>  <br>  Ivan Pavlov, (1849-1936) was an early proponent of behaviorism and the first to describe the phenomenon of classical conditioning. He is well known for the classic experiment in which he conditioned dogs to salivate on hearing a bell ringing, by first causing the dog's to associate the belling ringing with food, and then later removing the food itself altogether. <br>  <br>  Later, BF Skinner (1904-1990) believed that virtually all forms of behavior, could be explained by reactions to the environment alone. Rejecting mental mechanisms, Skinner proposed that human behavior could be explained through operating conditioning - 'the strengthening or weakening of behavior contingent on the presence or absence of rewards or punishments'. According to Skinner (1957), even language acquisition could be explained purely in terms of environmental contingencies. <br>  <br>  A Summary of the Behaviorist approach:<br>  <br>  ???○ Personality traits really are habits acquired through prior learning;<br>  ???○ Situational determinants of behavior are emphasized;<br>  ???○ Mental expectancies are used to explain behavior;<br>  ???○ Social reinforcement is said to shape the personality;<br>  ???○ Identification and imitation mechanisms are emphasized.<br>  <br>  You can read more about the philosophical underpinnings and history of behaviorism here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism</a><br>  <br>  Behaviorism has largely fallen out of late due to an increased understanding of the role of genetics and neurobiology in determining personality following the onset of the cognitive revolution in the late 1950's. For more info see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_revolution" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_r...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  2. The Social Cognitive Learning approach<br>  <br>  Social Cognitive Theory stemmed out of work in the area of social learning theory proposed by N.E. Miller and J. Dollard in 1941. Their proposition posits that if humans were motivated to learn a particular behavior that particular behavior would be learned through clear observations. By imitating these observed actions the individual observer would solidify that learned action and would be rewarded with positive reinforcement.The proposition of social learning was expanded upon and theorized by Albert Bandura.<br>  <br>  Bandura (1977-) while still supporting the main tenants of behaviorism, criticized Skinner's notion that behavior resulted from direct rewards for behaviors, and emphasized the social learning - that observations of rewards or punishment given to others could influences the observers behavior. <br>  <br>  According to Social Cognitive Learning theory:<br>  <br>  ???○ People learn by observing others.<br>  ???○ Learning is an internal process that may or may not change behavior.<br>  ???○ People behave in certain ways to reach goals.<br>  ???○ Behavior is self-directed not determined by environment.<br>  ???○ Reinforcement and punishment have unpredictable effects on learning & behavior.<br>  <br>  For more information on the social cognitive learning approach see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_cognitive_theory" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_cogn...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  3. Epigenetics<br>  <br>  The new field of Epigenetics seeks to study how the external environment and early experience either activates or inactivates specific genes related to personality and psychopathology. Much of the current research focuses on somatic epitypes - non-heritable epigenetic alterations in genes that can occur before or even after birth. Various studies have linked this to early:<br>  <br>  ???○ Exposure to heavy metals (such as lead);<br>  ???○ Differences in maternal care;<br>  ???○ Nutritional deficiencies; and<br>  ???○ Behavioral stress.<br>  <br>  Findings released last month, for example, have established a link between early childhood abuse in cases of survivors who had committed suicide and a gene that when active lowers the capacity to deal with stress.

I took it in the morning and in the evening and twice in between. Then I went on a trip with kids I didn't know that were half my age and even in their teens for a 2 week excursion. When I got back, I again did the test 4 times the next day. I looked at my results and I indeed did change a few of my character traits (personality). Not much! But, there was a change, mostly in the area of patience. Now, if this is a normal reaction, it would lend itself to be true that external forces "do" make small changes and if so, what would external forces change if one is still in the creation stage of development?  I took the liberty of looking up a similar test at a web site that gives results for free. It's not as in depth as mine, but, it's still something fun to do.|`|pm2EeEgiaa	In Psychology, personality is basically 50% biological and 50% environmental.

Sounds like you are comparing the two young gentlemen in your subconscious and the newer young man caused you to lose focus on the past.<br>  <br>  It seems to me you liked the first young man very much and maybe something went wrong in the first relationship and you don't want the same thing to happen with this one.  His movement, reminding you he was there dislodged your train of thought.<br>  <br>  If you are too busy trying to find out what doesn't work, you won't find out what does.

And if it helps the economy at the same time, then so be it.<br>  <br>  For this reason not all philanthropy helps the economy equally well.  <br>  <br>  A good example of philanthropy that helps the economy is education prizes and grants from private individuals or companies for gifted students.<br>  <br>  Another type of philanthropy that might not help the economy as much are religious donations for missionary work to convert people from one religion to another.
QFG0yu24aa	how you react to this sort of situation is different rationally than your emotional reaction. rationally, the guy made a reasonable mistake. emotionally however the guy is a murderer. not only that, but he murdered her bf. there is no easy way back from this, no matter how she rationalises it. if she is naive she might try to start a relationship with the guy. but then the nightmares (literally) will start for both of them and before you know it they are (maybe literally) seeing ghosts.|`|AA11678263	This is very difficult to read!  I hope you were just rushing when you wrote this, else it does not bode well for the scene!<br>  <br>  From what I understand of this, the guy hits his head on a wall, and when disoriented, shoots a girl's boyfriend dead.<br>  <br>  Hmmn.  Firstly, why does he think the other guy might be hurting the girl?  Does he have reason to think so?  Secondly, why does he have a gun?  Is it not risky to shoot blindly when confused and dizzy when an innocent girl is also present?<br>  <br>  Personally, I would blame a guy for shooting ANYONE.  I would judge him for having a gun, I would judge him for using it without due care, and I couldn't love and respect someone who had intentionally killed someone, whether they felt they were doing it for the right reasons or not.<br>  <br>  But... it's your character, and what she makes of it will depend on her past experiences and upbringing, and the sort of person she is.  If she likes this second guy and the other guy was her boyfriend, maybe she is even relieved not to have to choose?  It all depends on her motives and background, as afore mentioned.
H0Z6sYtnaa	To dream about the death of a loved one, suggests that you are lacking a certain aspect or quality that the loved one embodies.

27vNdc4baa	People are not affraid of the dark as such but rather what it represents<br>  <br>  Dark represents isolation, not knowing whats going on. Most of children's fear of the dark is due to the fact that in the light they can see whats going on and they are scard of "monsters" and if they cant see then they feel that these figments of their imagination could creep up on them.<br>  <br>  If ur ever in your home alone at night....stand up and go the light switch in your room. Switch the lights off (make sure no other lights on) its pitch black....you cant see your hand infront of your face...take a couple steps away from the light switch and jus stand there....you will have a feeling that something or someone is right by you, hovering over you...its a horrible feeling!|`|8BAsnn4Vaa	people naturally fear the unknown, and the darkness, which can hide someone/something is something unknown, which makes people fear it. really, they fear what could be in the dark more than the darkness. so, basically, it really is just how our natural instincts (however dormant or otherwise) kick in to try to protect us. we want to know what's going on, where its going on at, and be able to watch it go on with our eyes so we arent as confused.<br>  <br>  i hope you have a wonderful day!<br>  <br>  -Angel|`|bchci2Dkaa	The dark represents the unknown; what you can't see might lurk in the shadows.

When you cant see, you dont know what's there. They dont know if somethings there or if it was their imagination, or if you will be eaten or if you are safe. Its very stressful.<br>   People have a more vivid imagination than they prefer to admit. Using their limited senses, fogged by the disconcerting blindness, they have to imagine what could be making that noise, or what the soft thing they felt was.

t2b1yaaFaa	best thing u can do is do more things u enjoy and forget about all that stuff you hate, for example, if i'm stressed out, i usually forget all the projects/work i have to do and relax it out by either playing games or doing sports or even going for a walk or even porn! mainly porn, ha, i know its silly but it works a great. Talking to people doesn't seem to help me, however there is one person whom i love texting and letting her know that I'm stressed, and she tells me the same thing, to relax and do meditation etc but I never do that, ( i did try and it didnt work ), even chatting to people on messenger may help. Also if your going out clubbing or such, its really really easy to speak to older people. Like people who have experience most of life and such. If none of them work, then your far too special, think that. :)|`|7VGu9XUaaa	its understandable that you are hanging on to whatever happened to you in the past...but you have to let go of that. if u want to stop feeling this way and be able to love, you have to accept what happened to you was wrong, accept that it happened, and move on!|`|vY5HUrQPaa	From experience, I've discovered that disappointment comes when we put complete trust in people or anything else.  <br>  <br>  My key to getting out of despair, mental torment, aimlessness, and bitterness (to name a few) was by pursuing a committed relationship with God, through Jesus Christ. He fixes us like no one else can, for He made us for Himself. <br>  <br>  It's not religion, but relationship. He knows every detail of my life and yours- past, present, and future. Not only has He removed my negative issues (and is still working), He's audibly told me of His plans for my life, and brought me wisdom and understanding. When you consider the abuse that Jesus went through, He's very capable and will meet all your needs when you sincerely cry out to Him.<br>  <br>  So call out to God about everything, like I did. Ask Him for healing, to take the hatred, and to move on with life in Him. Be sincerely consistent, and expect Him to answer. He rewards those who diligently seek Him. <br>  <br>  Start a relationship by asking Jesus Christ to come into your heart, and to forgive you of any sin. Thank Him for dying for you so you can have eternal life. Confess that you believe He's the Son of God who has risen from the dead. Tell Him that you'll live for Him.<br>  Then stay in contact by talking to the Lord everyday, and follow His Life Manual (the Bible) daily, starting with St. John. Make friends at a local Bible-teaching  church and tell others about Jesus. <br>  <br>  Check out the sources below.|`|7YTiooX5aa	Well we all go through a period of hatered and some of us have a harder time letting it go. I don't know about your childhood but can only imagine, it obviously wasn't a pleasent childhood. As far as letting people walk all over you well you are the only one that can put a stop to that and that starts with on little word " NO! " if you don't want to then don't . I know easier said then done but once you say it a couple of times it gets easier. Reduceing tension is all up to you and what you really enjoy, like for me I get stressed out and tensed up and I get rid of it by either walking on the beach and takeing in all the beauty of things around me or locking myself up in my room blareing my stereo till I am no longer stressed out. Hope this has helped and take care|`|cebea3a8e8113acc7b540c298907a6c7aa	I would try 2 things. First, force yourself to follow what the peer pressure guides you to. If people around you act anal, do the same. If they act arrogant, act the same, if they act pious act the same!<br>  <br>   After a few weeks of this then do an about face!!!! <br>  <br>  Take a personality profile (here's a site with a free one) <a href="http://www.scientificpsychic.com/workbook/zamtest1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.scientificpsychic.com/workboo...</a><br>  instead of bending to the will of others follow your personality profiles characteristics. If it works out that you like yourself more with the being plastic and mirroring others then, dude, that's what you should do. If you find that you like yourself more as yourself and won't change for anyone, then that's the way to go. Either way you will gain some much needed knowledge about yourself.

How the person came out of both?<br>  <br>  so thats what can be the indicators of a person's future actions<br>  in between thats a really nice question.|`|6sJhoXAAaa	If the person recognizes his/her mistakes, and makes great effort to improve him/herself, there is a good chance that future actions will be under control.  That will mean a lot of work -- really trying with every means available (books, therapy, sincere apologies, and anything else it takes).<br>  <br>  Successes can continue, again if a great deal of effort is put into it.|`|MpNCNQU5aa	People learn from experience. If they made a mistake they may see the joy out of it and then end up experiencing the consequences. They may learn that experiencing the joy isnt worth experiencing the bad.<br>  this will change there future actions by making the right choice and or avoiding the bad action.|`|510MC9SVaa	If the person is not trying to change then past actions are fairly good predictors of future actions. If the person is past puberty. <br>  <br>  For example if a person is abusive and doesn't want to change or realize they need to change then they will more than likely continue to be abusive. If they realize they are abusive and try to change they can change. <br>  <br>  Without some type of motivation the change will most likely not happen.

Why do you think there are a zillion ads for products to help men with sexual performance? Obviously men are having a problem with it-look at the stats for older men. Some men lose their sexual drive and some older women get their drive in high or higher gear. Why do you think older women are getting it on with younger men, even in their 40's and 50's when there are plenty of men around their own age?

Not by the inhabitants of the communites anyway. Anarchist communities usually are ended by governments and armies coming and taking them over, so the government would be the ones murdering people.

cJAf4pU0aa	Some reasons for it are ignorance, stubbornness, narrow mindedness, and they have poor outdated role models.|`|3862H0WVaa	Eh!  I don't think that is correct as any women can do what she wants.<br>   <br>  Many laboring jobs are seen as beneath women by women more than by anyone else.|`|5c907c92a6c7447ccb431133ac7208abaa	Some ppl are frightened by changes in society. Some ppl think that if you don't act like everyone else around you, you're a freak. Others have been told by their family, community or religious group that gender roles are very rigid and that anything else is not acceptable. Some ppl don't know there are any other way of living, they are in isolated communities. Some ppl are in right-wing political communities who also don't want anything but rigid gender roles, they want to keep women in the home and men outside of it. I think a lot of it has to do with men fearing that if women get more choices, they won't choose them. They may be right, plenty of women choose divorce, don't they? lol|`|NYU37jfGaa	As far as I know, there's no law that says anyone has to keep to any particular role in modern society.<br>  <br>  As for women becoming bricklayers etc, I don't know how many women want to do those kind of jobs, but if they do I see no reason why they shouldn't, if they can achieve the same standards as men do.  However, I would imagine that when it comes to jobs involving physical strenght, women are always going to be at a huge disadvantage.<br>  <br>  And bricklaying isn't a profession, it's a trade.|`|B4YESGmwaa	If I understand you correctly you are not asking if men should be allowed to act like women and the reverse? What I think you are asking is why is society in general nervous or whatever word you use, about seeing males or females in different gender roles, ie, a male nurse not being as good as a female. or a woman not being able to be a roofer? Generally and I stress generally it takes years for people to fully embrace change in the social structure. I believe when you enter a non traditional field you have to be ready to deal with what comes with.... When I first went into my field it was more males, but many of them when inappropriate where sent to sensitivity training. I feel it is the same in some areas with people accepting different ethical back grounds in certain fields.

NGz7R9enaa	They already have in my opinion. I watched something the the history channel had on about secret societies and I believe the name of the most secretive and dangerous one was called the Bilderberg Group. They aim for a one world society and after meetings certain things "happen" like gas prices soaring, the U.N. changing or adapting something and so on. The members of the group are said to be some of the biggest names in the worlds society and the only name I can remember off hand was Bill Clinton. Another was a man from Canada that owns most of the countries news papers, but I don't recall his name. <br>  <br>  I don't know, I'm not a freak that worries about this sort of stuff too much cause I know that in the end, there isn't anything that I can do about it, but it does interest me. I also look at Walmart and how their stores are ran, as well as their products coming from everywhere but the US. I do believe that these larger than life companies are heartless and care only for the money in their pocket. I don't understand how they sleep at night, but I know that greed is an ugly thing.

510MC9SVaa	If you are concerned about the time it takes to get the degree, then either counseling or psychology are probably going to be better for you. If you are more concerned with the amount of money you will make, psychiatry pays better but you won't really be talking with the clients much. Most psychiatrists just write scripts after a very brief evaluation. <br>  <br>  How much you make depends on where you work and what you specialize in. For counseling the average starting salary is 25-38 thousand a year and takes 2-3 years past the bachelor degree. For psychology you need a doctorate which takes 4-6 years past the bachelor degree and pays anywhere from 24-50 (up to 100 for IO psychology) to start. For psychiatry it is a medical degree so about 10 years past the bachelor degree and starts at about 50,000. The top just depends on where you go.<br>  <br>  If you love listening and giving advice, I would suggest eitehr counseling or psychology degree. With either you can get a doctorate and either practice or teach at the college level. I suggest you check with the APA website and other places to see what is available and how much it will pay in your area.|`|bchci2Dkaa	Well, first off, you want a job in psychology, not psychiatry. Psychiatrists are the ones who prescribe medication, and rarely actually have any talk therapy type business because they are so busy prescribing meds.<br>  You might also want to look at careers in social work, which take less time to study for and can also lead to psychological therapy careers.<br>  Also, they make a lot of money. Every therapist or social worker I have met has been self-sufficient with a nice car.

AA11879371	Doesn't seem to be.  You have to remember, men are more spatially adept than women and all those curvy spaces, just turn them on.  But as one murder suspect on a CSI tv show said,  "It sure don't hurt if they got money."|`|NmQCYizTaa	I wouldnt say wrong, no.<br>  But I think its wrong that a woman has to be attractive, whilst a man has to have status (apparently, I dont know many women for whom this is true, maybe as they also work) as status can be changed, you can get education, work hard etc, whereas you're stuck with your looks.
AA11879371	When men get the urge to merge sometimes looks don't even matter.  At this point there is no good or bad, just whether the woman wants it, too.  If she doesn't then it's really really bad.<br>  <br>  It's biology and hormones.  I believe it's called "Sowing wild oats."|`|V1MptCMiaa	Yeah it's bad.

I do believe that many too many fall into this catagory. I think we as women need to start educating both our male children boyfriends and husbands to be more in tune with all of the areas you name. If we as women fail to educate how will they learn? Any male that just wants sex needs to be put aside-look for someone more sensitive. God Bless Reggie|`|8vTLjNzfaa	i think its filthy<br>  <br>  thats why society is grinding to the state it is now in<br>  <br>  men should consider all those things you mentioned because they all contribute to the woman. just because she is beautiful, doesnt mean she is for you.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped<br>  <br>  ------<br>  Usman|`|cJRFbZUaaa	It's neither good nor bad, it's just what they want.

2inq4zHZaa	I don't think it is sexist.  I think there are some things that need to be addressed to men and some to women, and that is why there are programs/magazines/books etc, that do just that.  I think it's a fair balance.  I just wish there were more things that addressed male issues without involving nude pictures of women.|`|V1MptCMiaa	No, go for it.|`|vEj7xoBraa	it would be nice.|`|AA11550519	Yes, it is sexist in the sense that it would focus exclusively, or overwhelmingly, on one sex. Kinda like oprah, tyra....<br>  <br>  So I have a question for YOU: Is it necessarily a bad thing? I mean, if men felt that there was a need for a man talk show, and were willing to pay for it, would it be a bad thing?|`|521978f4254c4b8f2b7244300239e951aa	It would be about as sexist as having magazines that are focused on men's issues.  So my answer is of course not.|`|qgL98Wv2aa	no....then all of the talk shows that only cater to women would sexist too......|`|Y3OeeB66aa	yes and that is why they do not exist
cJAf4pU0aa	I totally agree with you there! Plus I believe guys like to think they are more sexual, for their Egos...they seem to be all to hung up on "Ego and false pride"|`|YQOT68xFaa	Maybe it's because women will withhold it for months after giving birth, or make excuses to avoid it (headches, anyone?), or refrain because of resentment towards the man, or withhold it as a punishment when he displeases her. Could have something to do with it.|`|5c907c92a6c7447ccb431133ac7208abaa	I was more interested in sex in my marriage, as my ex husband was depressed. he had problems with his career. I wasn't happy either, but I was 21. But being in an unhappy relationship or having job problems affects many couple's sex life. My next ex was more interested than I, as I was being nagged to death. In my present relationship, both of us are happy and are doing it as often as we can! And I'm 50, when I'm suppose to have no sex drive. Sex drives vary among both men and women..and some women definitely have a high one, but we don't talk about it..|`|WKtakdsOaa	Depends on the woman and on blues points  I was having sex the day just before I went into labour and then only stopped sex for 2 weeks and 69 for 1 and my labia was ripped to bits. I didnt care though mate cause the pleasure outweighs the pain. Also sex helps get rid of headaches everyone knows that and I have had sex with my husband when we have argued and I just pretend I am not in a mood to get some sex and then after the sex I forgot why we argued. Nothing should be coming for sex except for your kids ;)|`|1OfLNwOPaa	Tell me,why they do so?Maybe they do not want to have some.They want the men to open the canned,to let them out of that closet and become that beast they maybe fear/know to be and feed its hunger.<br>  If I only knew!<br>  <br>  mmmm...|`|V1MptCMiaa	I agree.  Society has made it okay for guys to go around having sex with anything that moves and has made it a taboo for women.|`|shcnDVHsaa	Cause' I ain't a women.|`|1pup885baa	Blue Christian, I'll admit that I have definitely used the "headache" excuse a few times (although sometimes I legitimately DO have a horrible headache, but anyways...). I've only done that to one boyfriend. He was clingy, possessive, mean, and extremely manipulative. Emotional abuse isn't exactly a turn-on for me. <br>  <br>  Before assuming a woman is just being a frigid b*tch, it's probably worthwhile to try to figure out WHY she doesn't want to have sex with you. YOU might be part of the problem. <br>  <br>  Anyways, I agree with the person who asked the question. When I'm with someone who isn't a huge jerk (like I am now), my sex drive is through the roof. It's as high, or maybe even higher, than his.

Women are emotional creatures and sometimes just having a bad day at work can put a woman off of sex. It could be that time of the month, shes tired, her head hurts, her mind is somewhere else. These may seem like excuses but alot of times, they are true. Another thing, women can go a long time withouth having sex and not miss it nearly as much as men, so that whole ′punishing herself′ deal is not true.|`|1suTgWGoaa	- Otto Weininger : <br>  <br>  "Woman is only sexual, man is partly sexual, and this difference reveals itself in various ways. The parts of the male body by stimulation of which sexuality is excited are limited in area, and are strongly localised, whilst in the case of the woman, they are diffused over her whole body, so that stimulation may take place almost from any part. <br>  ....... There are, certainly, areas of greater excitability, even in the case of the woman, but there is not, as in the man, a sharp division between the sexual areas and the body generally."
YupMCYHlaa	Capitalism is -amoral-.  There's a difference.  You can use a hammer to build a house, but if you use it to kill someone, that's not the hammer's fault, it's -your- fault.<br>  <br>  I am about as liberal and 'socialist' as anyone here.  But even us liberals realize that capitalism is the best system because it builds wealth the fastest.  But to function properly, capitalism requires a certain amount of regulation by government.  Too much is as bad as too little, but finding the right balance is crucial.<br>  <br>  Without proper regulation, capitalism goes unstable and crashes.  That's what happened in 1929 and it's happening again now.  When that happens, we use a little bit of socialism to right ourselves. Socialism creates stability.  Once we find our bearings again, we move back towards capitalism.<br>  <br>  Republicans in the Reagan mold believe that -any- regulation is bad, that regulation is just evil.  So they deregulated all over the place, and didn't enforce what regulations were left, so capitalism crashed.

4Ovf0Gr8aa	well every dream you have is from thoughts in your head. things you have thought of before.. things you think about before you sleep.<br>  <br>  things that are in the back of your mind.<br>  one time or another, you've thought about what you've drempt about.<br>  doesn't mean you are sick, it's just an exaggeration of something that has ran through your mind.<br>  of course incest has ran through your mind because people tell you it is bad (because it is) therefore you thought about it..so you drempt of it.<br>  <br>  dreaming and remembering a lot of things is very healthy too.. so be glad that you drempt lol because you only dream within the REM stage. which is the rapid eye movement stage.. it is the deepest sleep.<br>  so 1.. be happy you drempt because you probably felt refreshed the next morning.. besides the weird awkward feeling..<br>  and i wouldn't worry about the dream, you might dream about it again because now you're really thinking about it.<br>  If you start to WANT whats happening in our dream then worry..<br>  but just dreaming about it doesn't mean anything besides random thoughts in your head that can be exaggerated.<br>  <br>  i wouldn't believe anyone that tries to explain certaint hings that happen in your dream that mean this and that because its not true.|`|IGXashPvaa	i dont know. <br>  maybe you were thinking about incest earlier on that day then had a dream about it, like once i saw kangaroos on tv and i had a dream about them at night.|`|K75OmKHzaa	Dreaming about having sexual contact with anybody means that you simply want to know more about them, not in a sexual way mind you!

You are in a phase in your life where you are not quite a child and not quite an adult, and thus this dream may be symbolic of the merging of the child and adult within yourself.

Our dreams can be effected, by what is going around us while we are sleeping, and what we did that day. when we are sleeping, one part of our mind, that thinks logically turns off, that is why we have crazy dreams of falling down and drowning. That day, when u had that dream, did u eat something before u slept, or did u meat with a family member could be able to cause a dream like that. Well here is an example. Last night, i had this crazy dream, about me sneaking in a church in the middle of the night with a friend, and we decide to watch a movie in the movie theatres, so we left, and when we got into the movie theater, we watch a horror movie, about a clown, and then we left the movie cause we got scared, but the clown was following us!!! We hurried to the church, and the clown leafs, but then there are vampires everywhere, and we had to compete in a race, for life or death. Well, the reason i got that dream, was because Yesterday, someone referred to the movie "It" and everyone talked about how much they hate clowns in my English class, and that day, my mom kept asking me if i was goin to church on Sunday, and i kept telling her No. And well, i read an awful lot about vampire books, so that's where the vampires came from. It was a crazy dream. Well, and about your dream, try to find out what made u think about a crafted box, it could have a meaning, but not exactly the meaning that u wanted it to be|`|5yzLfCWlaa	baseless dream.<br>  may be its your hand, take care of you hands, dose it have wrinkles? <br>  i don't believe in my dreams which comes at nite.<br>  I had thrown dust into eyes of a tiger who was coming to kill me from a train.<br>  there was tow dogs, i wanted help from the dog. but a woman sue them, then tiger was coming from train and when tiger jumped i throw dust into its eyes. lmao<br>  your dream is scary, its like ring part 2.<br>  may be the person u know was you, from future.<br>  it means nothing, i think dreams are just for wired neurones at night.|`|GZZyJJfZaa	idk<br>  <br>  but one time right before i moved i had a really strange dream where i was talking to this girl<br>  <br>  and it turns out that the girl became my best friend

Cocaine is highly dangerous compared to weed. Cocaine gets you hooked fast and its hard to quit as opposed to weed which doesn't really hook you. Alcohol is ALREADY legal so I don't know what you're talking about. Besides Alcohol does not have similar effects as weed... Cocaine gets you all hyper and weed makes you think weird thoughts. Alcohol makes you more depressed.

510MC9SVaa	Famous people with dissociative identity disorder include retired NFL star Herschel Walker, who says he's struggled with dissociative identity disorder for years but has only been treated for the past eight years.<br>  <br>  Walker recently published a book about his struggles with dissociative identity disorder, along with his suicide attempts. Walker talks about a feeling of disconnect from childhood to the professional leagues. To cope, he developed a tough personality that didn't feel loneliness, one that was fearless and wanted to act out the anger he always suppressed. These "alters" could withstand the abuse he felt; other alters came to help him rise to national fame. Today, Walker realizes that these alternate personalities are part of dissociative identity disorder, which he was diagnosed with in adulthood.<br>  <br>  This is the most famous one that was known for something else besides being DID. <br>  <br>  The stories of two women with multiple personality disorders have been told both in books and films. A woman with 22 personalities was recounted in 1957 in a major motion picture staring Joanne Woodward and in a book by Corbett Thigpen, both titled the Three Faces of Eve. Twenty years later, in 1977, Caroline Sizemore, the 22nd personality to emerge in "Eve," described her experiences in a book titled I'm Eve. Although the woman known as "Eve" developed a total of 22 personalities, only three could exist at any one time—for a new one to emerge, an existing personality would "die."<br>  <br>  The story of Sybil (a pseudonym) was published in 1973 by Flora Rheta Schreiber, who worked closely for a decade with Sybil and her New York psychiatrist Dr. Cornelia B. Wilbur. Sybil's sixteen distinct personalities emerged over a period of 40 years.<br>  <br>  Both stories reveal fascinating insights—and raise thought-provoking questions—about the unconscious mind, the interrelationship between remembering and forgetting, and the meaning of personality development. The separate and distinct personalities manifested in these two cases feature unique physical traits and vocational interests. In the study of this disorder, scientists have been able to monitor unique patterns of brainwave activity for the unique multiple personalities
cebea3a8e8113acc7b540c298907a6c7aa	If you are talking about yourself then there is hope, if you are wanting to make someone close to you change, then you are setting yourself up for failure and being excommunicated by the friend. Most people now-a-days have the self destructive idea that even if the ideas they have are wrong, at least it was their ideas. It seems people will not learn from others mistakes and must make their own and they won't gain the knowledge that it was a mistake until they go down in flames. The only way I've been able to get people to stop making an unbelievable amount of mistakes is to guide them into learning that past and present problems and solutions will help us gain knowledge for future problems, and solutions.|`|ImDjznrzaa	I don't think that you can "help" someone see they are making a mistake. It may not be a mistake to/for them, or perhaps , it is just what THEY really need to learn a life lesson.

Can something good come out of anything eventually? A child produced from a bad relationship can still be the greatest blessing in one life.<br>  I personally tend to learn more from the mistakes I make than from the easier things in life.

510MC9SVaa	Considering his abusive past, I think it may be a mistake to tell him he is being watched. I do agree with letting your children know about good touch bad touch and also emphasize that NO ONE, not even a relative is supposed to do stuff that makes them feel uncomfortable. That no one should talk to them about sensitive topics. Also, reminders as they grow up so they don't forget. A lot of parents have the good/bad touch talk with their little kids, but forget to follow through as the child matures. <br>  <br>  When you talk to them about the birds and the bees, remind them about good/bad touch and give them the statistics of who molests children the most (people they know). Also, tell them what to do if someone trys anything with them. To get away and find someone to tell, someone they can trust such as you or the counselor at school. Considering that your ex is a police officer, don't suggest they go to the police. The kids can tell you, a teacher at school, a counselor, even the bus driver. Just someone they can trust and someone that will DO something about it. <br>  <br>  Another reason I say don't tell him you are watching him is because he might use it against you and the kids. He could threaten the kids that if they tell on him, he will hurt them or that they will be "put away" because everyone knows they are lying. There are lots of ways that pedophiles con the victims into being quiet, so having the kids be informed is pretty important. As for telling them specifically to watch out for Dad, that is really up to you and how you think they will handle something like that. I wouldn't do it, but if you think they are emotionally capable of handling that, then you might tell them you are worried they might get hurt over at Dad's house, and to please tell you if they ever feel uncomfortable there. Also, you can send them with cell phones (with or without his knowledge) and they can call you if seomthing is wrong.|`|uxvskU7Xaa	i would work on getting full custody of the kids... keep them away from him <br>  he probably figures since he is a cop he won't get caught|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	OMG, what a mess.

I would go talk with the girl's parents and encourage them to bring charges.  I'm assuming she is the daughter of one of his siblings.  How much more history of sexual abuse has to happen in this family for someone to take all this seriously?  Right now it doesn't sound like there have ever been charges brought against him, and he is counting on that.  Would his sisters testify about the sexual abuse within the family?  Would his niece come forward now and tell a judge what happened?  If they refuse, don't count on a judge listening to you.  You would be shocked at how many ex-wives tell judges their ex sexually abused their kids or someone else.  So it would be your word against his.... and he's a cop.

510MC9SVaa	Well, the easy answer is NO you are not prone to DID. If you remember creating the alternative life and you realize it is an alternative life you are not dissociating. You are simply fantasizing. 99 out of 100 people with DID were severly abused starting before the age of 5. Most of those people do not know they have alternate personalities and they did not consciously create the alternative personalities. <br>  <br>  This is not to say that there isn't something going on, but more than likely it is not DID. The percentage of people with DID is somewhere between .01% and 1% of the general population.
