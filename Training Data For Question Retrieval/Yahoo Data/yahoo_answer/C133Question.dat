Too much info!?	im TTC  1 my period is on the FIRST DAY of EVERY month no matter how long the month is (its been that way since i got off DEPO about a year and a half ago)   so i started my period january 1st it lasted 4 days, (it wasn't real heavy or light, just normal)    my husband came in me when i WAS fertile so i was hoping that maybe i got pregnant i started having early "symptoms" like frequent urination heart burn and fatigue, then on feb 1st i didn't start which is very unusual for me. then i did late in the evening on the 2nd  (that really upset me)    but it only lasted 1 day and then i had spotting yesterday    but when i was on it was very heavy   and very bright, TMI i know  but the spotting was a very light pink and a little brownish and it looked like a slug had been in my panties  very gooey clear mucus,  (eww i know)      so anyway the question is could that have been implantation bleeding?   i know that it it typically light   but is it possible?    by the way we just started TTC last month  thanks and baby dust to all

20090205125459AANc4CT	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Is it illegal to keep a parent from seeing a child?	My Dad has a five year old child with his now ex-girlfriend and she's doing everything she can to keep them from seeing each other.  He had a paternity test yesterday, just to be sure she's his, but we all know she is.  Even then the mother kept a blanket over the child's head.  Anyway, he wants to try to fight for custody or at least visitation rights.  Isn't it illegal to keep a parent away from their child?  The mother had house arrest and has been to jail for beating up her own mother, so who knows what she's doing to this child.      Any advice?

I've been on the pill for three months, and I've just finished a third pack, meaning I'm on the sugar pills. So yesterday my spouse and I decided to have some "cramp-fixing sex". Well, we went through one session using a condom, then about ten minutes later, started another session, again using a condom. The condom broke, and he didn't feel it right away, so we'd kept going. He did not finish inside me, and we stopped as soon as we realized it. I don't know if the condoms we used were had spermicidal lubricant (Trojan Magnum Large), and I have no access to any "Morning After" solutions. What are the chances of being pregnant?

20090205133649AAWUpqX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What is your feeling on having only one child?	Based on a conversation I had with my SIL today, it got me thinking about this topic.  They have one son who is 1 1/2 and at this point don't plan to have another (although my BIL is inclined, she is not).  Her reasons being her age (37- would be 38 when she delivered), they don't own a home, aren't in overly stable jobs, and they don't currently have health insurance.  While I agree that she has valid points- I feel really sorry for only children.  So multiple question here: if you are an only child- did you ever wish for siblings?  Should having kids be based on whether or not you can afford it?  (and while I expressed a little of my opinion- I was very careful in how we discussed and I left it at I can think what I want but it's really none of my business what they do)

20090205134746AACtanv	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Which is worse taking a sick child to daycare or going to work sick to save sick days?	Sadly in our economy very few people can have a parent stay home.  Also with single parents on the rise  we are facing issues we never had to face before.  I get 10 sick days a year and I drag myself into work to save it for when my kids are sick. I possibly infect all kinds of people as i work with the public  and my coworkers and possibly their kids.  It takes a lot for me to stay home for me.    i know parents who know their kids have a cold but send them to school or daycare because they have no back up and they save their sick days for when the kids arereallyly  really  sick.    I have one coworker who's parents are coming from out of town to watch her son after surgery next week because she has no more sick or vacation days left. (hopefully the surgery helps him out so he can get better and she won't need to take so much time)   Employers show no sympathy for the plite of the working parent. They, especially in this economy,  are quick to fire you because there are 10 people lined up to take your job.  Of course they won't say it is for missing days they will find another legal way to get rid of you.  Or you live in a no fault state were they don't even have to give you a reason

The part I have problems with is that she is constantly telling me about what I should get for my baby, and how I should parent him. I may be young, but I know that I can be a good mom on my own. She constantly gives my crazy unwanted advice, but I don't know how to tell her that it's getting to me, because she'll say that we're ungrateful. I'm losing my mind! HELP!

I saw the baby on the ultrasound screen and it was so clear (dont know if that means anything). I told my boyfriend and he just kept saying he was gonna stay with me and the baby and that he would never leave. He also kept wanting to rub my belly (it was getting annoying and wierd). It was winter time (like it is now) and we were just walking and talking about how he thought I should hurry up and tell my mom. Then it seemed like he was about to say something else really important but then I had to wake up...      The wierdest thing to me about it is that i never remember my dreams especially not this good.       Also I had it twice. Like I the first time I woke up it was like 3 or 4 am so of course I went back to sleep then I had it again.

20090205140459AAfKHEO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Does my wife sound like a bad mother?	OK we have a four year old little girl who is potty trained. Last night she got into trouble and was in her room. We had company, and sent her in there. Now, she has a bathroom connected to her room. She was mad, and peed in the floor. My wife went in there and saw it. She asked her why. She said becasue you are mean. She obviously did it on purpose. My wife spanked her bare hiney three times and made her help clean it up. It was the first time she ever had a bare bottom spanking. The only reason is, is my wife caught her in the act of doing it.    My wife felt bad becasue she spanked her. I think Jessica deserved it becasue it was intentional. Does she sound like a horrible mother? I promise she is the most loving mother ever. I think this deserved to be punished though

20090205145221AAwdJIx	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Would you be willing to donate money to help buy tombstones for babies?	First of all, I'm sorry to put this in this section since it's sad, but I didn't really know where else to put it.      I was walking in the cemetery today when I noticed how many babies do not have tombstones. It makes me really sad to see this. I know most of them say "unknown infant" but I think these children at least deserve a proper marker for their graves.      If I tried to raise money in my community for this, do you think people would be willing to donate to it, or would it be a lost cause?      This is what most of the grave sites have as a marker:    http://i314.photobucket.com/albums/ll430...       Some of the sites do at least have a name:    http://i314.photobucket.com/albums/ll430...     http://i314.photobucket.com/albums/ll430...       This is just a portion of how many there are:    http://i314.photobucket.com/albums/ll430...     http://i314.photobucket.com/albums/ll430...       I also saw this one which I thought was strange:    http://i314.photobucket.com/albums/ll430...          Also, how does a grave get marked as "unknown infant?" How do they not at least know a last name?
20090205145757AA2lgRc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Is the Adolescents section a teen chat place....?	As a good yahoo answer user put it.    "The Adolescent section is found under the category of Pregnancy and Parenting. I think all the sections listed under the Pregnancy and Parenting heading are intended to categorize the questions into subsets specific to age groups. So, the Preschool and Toddler section is not a place for the 2-4 age group children to post questions any more than the Adolescent section is for teens to post questions. I believe the initial intent was for the Adolescent section to field questions from parents about issues with their adolescent age children. I don't think it should be a place for teens to post questions about things like homework or a problem with their computer since there are separate categories for those, but if teens have questions specific to their age group I think posting questions there is fine as long as they understand that parents and other adults are just as likely to answer as kids their own age. I don't think any one group should hold claim to the category, but I do feel that the questions should be limited to specific adolescent issues."

20090205150241AAtb3Ux	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Why does my cousin do this?	Every time I go to a new store and she's with us, she calls her mom and says "Mom I found a new store I want to go to! Can you take me there?!"  Like today, I went to Pac Sun and I had to try on a pair of jeans, and while I was trying them on, my mom said that she called her mom and asked her to take her to Pac Sun.  She goes to Aerpostale, Hollister, American Eagle and other stores like that.  They are totally different from Pac Sun, and Hot Topic. (She goes there to. But AFTER I went there.)  She always does this.  Even though she is more popular than I am, she still feels the need to 'out-do' me.  I wear my zebra stipped shirt, she goes and get her sisters zebra stripped jacket.  I wear skater shoes, she wears her sisters skater shoes.  She always tries to be the center of attention and she hates it if I am.  She has always though of herself as the most pretty person in the family. (Even though she isn't. She more of a sl*t.)  And advice on how to make her stop?  Do I just confront her about it and ask her to stop copying me?

20090205143147AArjUpI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Not so bad contractions, 2-4 minutes apart?	I was informed this morning I'm not expected to last the week.      I've been timing my contractions, which aren't that bad. I can still walk and talk and everything like normal with all of them except a few.       They're 2 minutes to 4 minutes apart, almost a regular 2. But like I said, only a few are painful enough for a deep breath (Lamaze Breathing breath). Most are more like a strong Braxton Hicks. When I was monitered Tues I didn't even feel one of the two real ones I had, it was just back pain. Walking DOES make them worse.      Do we need to head on? Its a 30-45 minute drive (depends on traffic). Or do we have time for supper? I'm hungry lol. At the same time, I don't want to waste time and money/gas going for a false alarm.
20090205142910AAzeKJa	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Would the following girl little girl like her daddy/he does not pay child support?	Would the following girl little girl like her daddy.  She is living with her mother and she sees her father several times a week or even more.  Her mother encourages her to spend a lot of time with her father and his extended family.  The mother thinks this is very important.  Her father does not pay child support, because the law does not allow this.  Her mother thinks that it is selfish for a mother to ask for child support from the father troughs the courts.  Her mother gets welfare and free medical insurance from the Government if she can’t afford it.  That is why her father pays a lot more taxes than he would have in America.
20090205141824AAmEvK5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is this a good age to get pregnant?	I know it's probably never a good idea to plan ahead for the future, but I'm an organizer and plan anyway.      I'd like to be 23 when I have my first child. By then I'll be married, we'll both have jobs (each with at least a bachelor's degree), and have money saved up.       Is 23 a good age to have children? I'd like to start earlier because I want two children - severe endometriosis and fibroids run in my family, and my gynecologist has said it may be hard to get pregnant if I wait until I'm older to have children due to irrevocable damage to my fallopian tubes and uterus.

It's just a fun, random survey and it's not about sex or drugs or anything bad at all.       What am I doing wrong?

20090205151815AAnFBqG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	9 Positive pregnancy tests, my doctor doesn't think I'm Pregnant?!?	I took 3 Clearblue Easy Digital tests, 3 First Response, 1 doctors office urine test and 2 Rite Aide Brand pregnancy tests.       I don't have PCOS or a tumor and I don't take any kind of hormonal or fertility treatments.       I had a few procedures done checking my uterus and fallopian tubes to check for anything and to check for my hormonal levels. Everything was fine. But I got my first pregnancy test (positive) 5 days later which makes my doctor skeptical I'm pregnant.     I haven't gotten any negative results at all and my last period was December 27, 2008.       What do you girls think?

20090205151916AAxtUUB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Does this sound like twins?	This is my second pregnancy and I'm fairly big for 11 weeks. I have extreme nausea and have only vomited once. I have increased fatigue and volumous saliva which is making me gag & made me sick that once. I have a 3 year old girl and not sure if chasing after her is the cause of my fatigue.   The other thing that makes me suspect is the wriggles. I have felt wriggles high on my left and deep down on my right hand side sometimes at different times and occassionally together.   I know an Ultra sound would confirm it but that isn't till 17th Feb so just speculating at the mo.   Thanks in advance for your answers.   Dawn.
20090205094632AAKoUgN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How do you get people to understand your child's health condition?	My daughter Bella has severe asthma, her main trigger is cigg smoke and residue on people who smoke.       We've been invited to her cousin's first birthday party, I was set to go until I realized her great grandmother will be there...Great Grandma is a pack a day smoker and will smoke during the party outside. Back in June of 08, it was 20 minutes of sitting in great grandma's lap that sent Bella to PICU for three days where she was formally diagnosed with asthma.      I tried talking to our uncle last night and he thinks it's the smoke and as long as she's outside smoking, all is good. I told him repeatably that it wasn't just the smoke but the residue and he didn't get it. I told him I would offend his mother if I showed up and told her she couldn't come near the baby, not to mention we'd have to stay outside the entire time, he just didn't get it.      I talked to a specialist this morning who said under no circumstances could we go.      How do I make them understand that we aren't trying to dissassociate ourselves with that side of the family, it's just that Great grandma makes for a dangerous environment...What would you say?      I am going to invite them down to visit us and go to the aquarium on the weekend of their choice, alternatively we could also head out to see them when Great-Grandma goes back to San Fran. (They live about 2 hours away)

20090205122509AA1xc2U	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Divorce with a 2 year old...What should I tell her? PLEASE HELP?	My daughter and I lived with her dad til she was about 10 months. We have lived apart since then but she used to talk to him on the phone and he came to visit her twice. Now I haven't spoken to him and he doesn't even call to talk to her.       When we were "talking" he'd always talk to her also, so she got used to talking to him on the phone and hearing him promise to come see her (without actually doing it). He never came at Xmas and now won't even talk to her (because he doesn't want anything to do with me, but she's the one suffering, I couldn't care less about me talking to him - just her).      My poor baby keeps calling for him and telling me he's coming. Whenever she cries, she says, "Dadddyyyy!!!!!! I want my Daddy!" or "Daddy's coming!" It breaks my heart and I don't know what to tell her.      I don't want to disrespect him to her or make her sad but I don't know what to say. It's so frustrating when I'm there taking care of her and he's off being some non-caring jerk. What do I tell her so that she doesn't end-up hating me in the future for degrading her father (even if it's the truth) AND she doesn't keep high hopes up about him and can hopefully forget about him a little more???      She is only 2, so there's little she will understand - no long speeches at this point. What are some short phrases that can help?

We are both 22, eat really healthy, don't smoke, and my husbands drinks in moderation ( maybe a few beers on the weekend) and i don't drink at all. But my husbands parents took 15 years to get pregnant. They found out the reason they could not conceive was because his dad was huge alcoholic and his sperm had no tails.

20090205143835AAdkPrm	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Did you take paxil or are you taking paxil during pregnancy?	I have severe depression as well as anxiety disorder.  I have never had this problem during pregnancy, and its only getting worse.  My doctor ok'd me for zoloft which I have been taking for a month now, but it is having no effect.  In the past, whenever I have had these problems Paxil got rid of it completely.  I stopped taking it at the beginning of this pregnancy because of the risk of heart defects.  Since the heart is developed now, Im wondering would it be okay to start taking Paxil since I am now 13 weeks?  Im going to the doctor when I get the chance so I don't need you to tell me to do that, please speak from experience or actual knowledge.  Thank you.

Germany (what little girl wants and get because she is in Germany, and legal right under German law)   USA (mother wants and has legal right under US law)      She was born in the US and has lived her first 8 years in America.  In a divorce her mother was granted custody and father order to pay child support and allowed 4 days a month.        German father took her to his native country Germany shortly afterward, and 13 months later a German Court rules that she can stay with her German father, because the little girl was able to fully interrogate in Germany and it would be inhume to take her away from her father. The little girl told the court in Germany that she wanted to live in Germany with her father, but still wants to see her mother (if she agrees not to take her away from her father in Germany), who she has not seen in 13 months.  She was sacred that her mother would take away from her father.  She tells her mother 13 months later that her father is the best father in the world and wants to live with him in Germany, but still wants to see her mother if her mother will not take her away from her father.

20090205154203AA5Zk8a	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Frustration and confusion! Clear Blue Easy Fertility Monitor?	I am now on cycle day 12. I know this seems a little anxious but how come I still only have one bar (low fertility) on day 12? This is my first month using it and most women say that you will get a lot of HIGH days during your first month using, however we have had none.  I get up first thing every morning and check at 9 am like clockwork.  Still nothing.  I know not all women ovulate on day 14 and I know that not all have high fertility so early in cycle, however, after 2 yrs of trying unsuccessfully, I am starting to think that the reason why we were unsuccessful is because we are not ovulating! Am I being irrational? Should I be worried so early in my cycle (day 12)? Should I give it a little more time? What should I think If I don't get a high or peak reading at all this month? Sorry for so many question! Thank you all!      Also can holding the strip in your urine stream too long throw off the results? Maybe I keep it under there too long!  Thanks again!

I am very confused as to what to do, i have tried giving him toys to play with to entertain him, i tried to put him in his baby walker so he could follow me, but he wouldn't move, he just cried and cried. Does anyone have any good advice???

I'm wondering how are you all keeping a sleep schedule for a 6 month old who is teething?  What are you all doing differently or are things pretty much the same for you? I've tried making a sleep schedule for my son even before he was teething and it never really worked.  He picks his own bedtime which can be around 9:30/10pm, sometimes later, and he wakes up AT LEAST 2 or 3 times throughout the night! (It's very tiring!)  I have tried Baby Orajel which only works for a little while for my son and now I'm using the Hyland's Teething Tablets...curious - Can I do both?!!? Also, can you all please give me some ideas/tips/suggestion, anything?!?! Hope I'm not asking for too much but I really need some help in this area. THANK YOU SO MUCH! :o)

Its not that he doesn't want to harm the baby or anything like that, he just says he's tired or not feeling well... The thing is he got laid off 2 months ago, so he's hardly been doing any work to be tired... I have a week left and I keep telling him that sex can encourage labour, but he still won't have sex with me... Its been like 4 months and we,ve had sex about 5 times... I just wondered if anyone else has had this... Before I was pregnant we used to have it virtually every day so why won't he...

20090205094427AAijsmy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	For women who have had a misscarriage...?	I had a miscarriage in December, I had my period in January and it was on the exact day I should have been counting from the miscarriage.  I was due to start 2 days ago and have not yet, but have had symptoms that I was starting.  I made a post the other day and was told that the pms and pregnancy symptoms can be the same.  All the hpt's I have taken say negative.      If you have had a miscarriage, did your period go back to normal right after, or did you experience a major change in cycle?      When I do a toilet paper test, I sometimes get a little blood, mostly light brown, but I am not bleeding out and there have been times where I haven't had anything.  Just curious to how long it will take me to get back to normal.  And if I am pregnant, shouldn't I be testing positive yet, since I have missed my start date?      I know this is a lot of info, but thanks for your help!!

They recently contacted us to babysit again and once we sat down and figured out the hours it seemed like it wasn't worth what they were paying. So, I was discussing with her them paying us $2 and hour per child and we wouldn't be charging for the hours the 5 year old is in school and she got an attitude with me! We would charge for the hours they are asleep because even though they're sleeping we are still in charge and if something were to happen and they got sick we would be up taking care of them.

Everytime she had a migrane it has been bright and snowy outside, could the lighting cause them? Shes due on her period on the 20th of this month so she wouldn't know if she skipped one?

Does this sound like implantaion bleeding to anyone ? and i know everyone is going to say 'take a test' ! okay thats obvious ..i just need an opinion and then i'll get one. thanks (:

I know there are the co-sleepers that you can buy but I am wondering more about the moms that actually sleep in the bed with their babies.

My concern though is he crawls. What if he wakes up and crawls right of the bed? What about rolling over on him. I'm not a heavy sleeper but anything is possible...      How do you deal with this? I'd love to hear from some moms that co-sleep with their kids like this.      Thanks in advance!

I am being tested for preeclampsia due to swelling and high BP and stuff and the other night the doctor asked if I was having any upper abdominal pain.

It's VERY uncomfortable and a very annoying pain, sometimes making my stomach itchy or numb.    For anyone who has had preeclampsia, did you have this kind of pain at all? Or is it just a normal pregnancy pain?   I am just wondering because i read a website listing symptoms, and this was one..

20090205095924AAN81wQ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How do you try to remain calm in stressful situations while pregnant?	Ok here's whats going on with my job right now:      I work at a small insurance agency, just the boss, me, and another woman.  Business is super slow right now.  The boss can barely pay the bills and she gave us our paychecks today and warned us they may bounce.  Also the boss is bipolar and is in a very very very bad low right now.  She expects us to call random people out of the phone book and do quotes, but we just get hung up on so or told "no thanks" so she tells us we're not trying hard enough.  The other woman is thinking about quitting leaving only me, and I know the boss won't hire anyone new to replace her.  She won't let us turn the furnace up past 63 (and it's 4 degrees outside!)  She bought us each an electric heater but the building is old and the windows are very drafty and our offices are very very large so the heaters don't help much.  I can't afford to go out and buy a bunch of warm clothes, especially since i need to start buying maternity clothes.  I hoping to buy new pants this weekend that fit because my belly is growing, but if my paycheck bounces, I'm screwed!      And I hate to say it but the only thing keeping me going is knowing that if the office goes out of business, I can get unemployment!      I have bad days too but I always try to stay optimistic and keep a smile on my face but it's getting really really hard to do right now...like this morning, I was up at 4 a.m. trying to thaw our pipes and then i got the worst morning sickness I've ever had (honestly! I cried it was so bad!) and then my step-daughter threw a temper tantrum that went on and off for about an hour, but i still managed to come in with a smile on my face.      Looking for a new job is out of the question.  Before I was pregnant, I'd say it's the perfect cocktail night, but that's obviously out of the question tonight.  Any advice to try to stay sane?

20090205134233AAjdNnU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Best options for my induction to not end in Csection?	I am 40.2 weeks and was able to put off my induction until 41 weeks because I want to give my body a chance.  Im still 80% effaced, but only went from a fingertip dilated to 1cm.  At my request the attempted a membrane sweep.  However, she couldnt do much because of my dilation.      So, I am scheduled to go in Tuesday night and have my cervix ripened w/ the gel.  They said they could give me a sleeping pill, so I rest and I am to start induction the next morning.      They are using Pictocin.  I asked the doctor if my labor would be longer and she assured me he would be born that day or early the next day.  (Im sure she is trying not to worry me.)  They said sometimes the rippening is enough to get things going and the induction is not always needed???  She said I can get my epidural at anytime and they will gradually increase the pictocin, so I wont go from 0-100 w/ the contractions?      Should I get the epidural sooner or later?  (I want to be able to feel to push because Ive heard how it can end in a Csection)      Do you have any other advice or ways I should tell them I want to procede w/ the induction?      Im still keeping my fingers crossed it will happen naturally before then!

Okay I've got some time to think about it cuz my son is only 6 months old, but I keep reading questions relating to the first birthday party.  What should I do?  There really won't be any other kids there.....maybe his cousin who is 2 months younger, a 2 year old and a 10 year old.  I can't make it a "big" party because we won't have the money, and he won't remember it anyway.  Should I just have a gathering of the close family at our house?  Throw some ideas at me for a mom on a budget!

20090205120148AA0CdJD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What can I expect when I go in to be induced?	I'll be induced at 40 weeks, next wednesday. I'm being induced b/c I have GD & my Dr. doesn't really want me to go over my due date so the baby doesn't get too big. I heard her say on the phone to the hospital to start me out on pitocin & check my sugars every 4 hours. She also said most inductions take 12 hours, did she mean it'll take me 12 hours to fully dialate? I hate when I think of these questions after I leave the office. Also does anyone know if I'm still suppose to be checking my blood sugar ? I'm thinking whats the point I'm being induced anyways, not like I'm gonna eat all crazy I just don't want to be pricking myself If I don't have to. Anyways, thanks for all the help!

20090205133842AAbnYub	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is this weight gain healthy for a pregnant woman?	I have always weighted around 108-112 (I'm 5'3) but when I was 9 weeks I was 106 because I had lost weight from being disgusted by a lot of foods at the beginning of my pregnancy. I am now 33 weeks pregnant and have gone from 106-132 gaining about 2 pounds every two weeks. So that's 26 lbs so far all on my belly. I told my friend I may get to 34 lbs by the time I deliver and she said that's way too much. Is it too much? Is it unhealthy? How much more do you think I'll gain by then? I was calculating it based on 2-3 lbs a week til then.

20090205105335AAL0P56	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	My brother's trashy girlfriend is pretending to be pregnant?	He called me last night asking for advice.      My brother got this girl he was dating and doesn't really like pregnant...  she is being really strange.  She is refusing to met anyone in the family and even made my brother stand in the road when she picked him up- not to be seen.  She had one ultra sound at the free clinic at 6 weeks and refused to let my brother keep the picture.  He showed it to my mom and had to give it back.  (Oh, her sister is a nurse there too).  Now she is 9 weeks pregnant, claiming to have cravings.... and to be too sick to work... my brother started paying her bills thinking it was the best thing for the baby.  She tried to get my brother to move to florida which we later found out was her dad idea- he wanted to retire and have my brother support them ALL.      So here are the questions- my brother want to know-   1. Can he legally make her prove her pregnancy?   2. Can he get a paternity test done before the birth?   3. When can he file for custody of the baby? He wants full custody which I don't know if that possible in NJ.  (She wants the baby because she wants the child support so he knows she is going to fight him.)      My brother's feeling are so mixed on the whole thing- at one point he is making excuses for her and then the next talking about what a terrible mom she is going to be.

I'm going to start her on a little rice cereal by spoon.  I've read and read online about it, but am still confused. I know her primary source of nutrition should be breast milk.   I'm going to try the cereal tonight for dinner.  Do I offer her the cereal before the bottle or vice versa? And how much cereal should she eat once she gets the hang of it?      She eats a 6 oz bottle of breast milk about 5-6 times a day right now.  If I offer her the 4 or 5 oz bottle then mix the other ounce in with the cereal would that be okay?    Can you tell she's my first? =)
20090205113940AAoExOH	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Does this sound like a miscarriage?	I asked this question about an hour ago and wanted to know if anyone else had any info about this...  Thanks   At the end of Sept 08 I started to develop a very odd smell "down there". I also never had an actual period, only spotting. About one week ago i finally had money to go to my family doctor. They took my urine a tested it for a urinary tract infection, but not a pregnancy test. Over the past few months, I myself took 4 tests, 3 of which were positive and one was negative. Then I did have an actual period, so I assumed that I wasn't pregnant, but yet the foul odor was getting worse. So, when I went to the Dr.'s a week ago she did a vaginal examine and assumed I must have an infection, but needed to do a test, because the medicine was very strong. I went into the bathroom again and was pushing very hard to pee, while doing so, I could feel a large mass coming out of me. It was a large shiny white mass of tissue that was about the size of a chicken egg. I went and got the Dr. to look at it, She made no deal about it and flushed the toilet. Now, almost immediately the odor is gone, and I feel completely normal again. I also know that it was not a tampon, because I don't wear them. Please help anyone. Thanks in Advance!

I felt pressured to so I tried for a few days but it was not happening so I stopped.  I can't say I put any effort into it or did any research or seeked any assistance.      No I am due in 11 days and I want to breastfeed.  Here is my question -       If I try and I get support and all that (done a lot of research) but during the process of working out the 'kinks' my baby does not get milk or enough milk (for example, I can't get him to latch or the milk production is low or whatever the problem is), what do I do to make sure he is getting the nutrition he needs in those few days?      Also - since the milk does not come in for about 3-5 days after delivery, can the baby really live on the colustrum (sp?) for those few days?        I am scared that my baby will not get enough nutrition as I am trying to get breastfeeding down.      I do have a pump btw.      Thanks.

20090205130117AAq6g97	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Could there be something wrong with my baby...?	First of I want to explain that I am not complaining!    But I want to explain to you why I am so worried though.    O.k., I found out by taking a digital pregnancy test about a week ago that I am pregnant. I was estimated at being 6 to 7 weeks a long and I am supposed to be due around 9/23/2009.    The way that I knew that I was pregnant is because one morning I woke up and I vomited all over the floor and everywhere else. I took a pg test the same day and I confirmed it.    Well I had nausea and occasional vomiting for around four days. The first was the worst (my pg test day), the second was not as bad, third mostly nausea and a little vomiting, and the forth day only nausea. For the last two days I have had no nausea and no vomiting. Actually I have been waking up refreshed and renewed every morning like I am not even pregnant.    My question I guess is do you think that there is something wrong with my baby? Could I have miscarried and not known it? I am so worried. With my first daughter I had constant vomiting for months and it lingered for months and months.    I can not go to the baby doctor until Feb 20th (today Feb 5th) and I am so concerned. I am keeping myself up at night crying thinking about if I have lost my baby and I just don't know it yet. I have actually worried myself so bad that I almost vomit just because I am so worried.    I am not very far along, and no ultrasound yet of course so I could even be less. The chances are so good right now that I could have miscarried and not known it, I am not even 1/2 way into my first trimester yet.    Please help me, I am so sad and I feel like crying all the time. All I want to do is feel pregnant at least a little bit but it's like it's never happened. I feel crazy, like there is no baby in there at all.    Could we have all been wrong?    Any answers and/or support would be greatly appreciated. My fiance doesn't understand anything and no one understands how I feel right now.    It's not that I want to be vomiting all the time, I just feel crazy like I woke up from a dream and there is no baby. But, it's no dream and I feel so scared and a lone.    It does not help that I had to stop taking my anti-depressant/ anti-anxiety medication cold turkey.    Please don't be mean, my heart just can't take any more pain right now.    Thanks in advance.

20090205102641AAx9qmY	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Late Period.. Pregnant?	I started taking birth control pills about 5 months ago. My weeks start and end on a Tuesday, and I usually get my period on Thursday Morning. It is now Thursday afternoon and I haven't got my period. I had sex with my boyfriend last night (without technically being on the pill), we didn't use a condom, but he pulled out, he doesn't want me to be pregnant as much as I don't want to. I know it was stupid, but is there any chance I could be pregnant, or is a day late normal?

After having intercourse I looked down and saw a thick mucus with i little bit of pink in it and I was wondering could it have been my mucus plug? I started having contractions after words that were 3min apart but ive been having contractions on and off for 2weeks so I wasnt that worried. They tryed to stop the contractions 2weeks ago but it did not work. So they gave me a steroid shot to help develope the babies lungs faster.

I have a pretty drama-filled job and I hate most of the people that I work with. I found out today that I won't get any benefits from the company, and that they may not hold my position for me even when I leave to have the baby.       I just left the hospital from being there for two days this week because I had high blood pressure. I'm thinking that it's from the stress that my job causes...I have no other forms of stress; I have a great home life and a wonderful fiance.       This is my first baby and I don't want to risk anything after being so far along. What would you suggest?

We are faithful to each other and neither of us have had any other partners so STD's/STI's are not an issue. Also, we realize that Plan B is not meant to be used in place of a regular contraceptive but it is all we can think of as a way to try sex without a condom.
20090205112648AAx42Cs	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnancy/Tylenol PM question...?	SO-   I have been taking Advil PM to sleep. I am taking more than recommended (usually like 3-4) I know...I shouldnt be taking that much but- also- I hurt my back a couple weeks ago and was given loratab (7.5) for the pain. So I will take the Advil and then if I wake up with pain I will take a loratab (just one). Well- last night I woke up in the middle of the night with HORRIBLE cramps -like period cramps- and I took a loratab. NOW- I am thinking that I could be pregnant. My husband and I  had sex unprotected- no pull out- the whole week I was supposed to be ovulating- not trying to get pregnant- just not really preventing it- My period started on the 5th last month.       My question is this- will me taking the pills I have affect my pregnancy now if I am pregnant? I will stop taking them all together now just in case. Sorry this is long ...thank you for your help!

20090205122211AATCZE0	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Why Am I having vaginal pains and frequent spotting?	I am 18 years old, and i have been sexually active with my boyfriend for the past three months. This last month has been really weird. I have been spotting almost every day, and get frequent sharp pains in my vagina that last anywhere from 10 seconds to several minutes. I just started taking yaz birth control a month ago, so i thought that these were normal symptoms, and would go away after the first month. Well last night when we started having sex, i almost immediately started bleeding, this was a lot more than spotting. There left a fist sized mark of blood on my bed. I have continued to spot and have the same severe vaginal pains as before. Also, for the past two weeks i have been itching right after intercourse. It would go away usually by the next morning. For the past 5 days I have been itching, and it will not subside. So if anyone could please help me out, i do not know what is going on.

My baby is 2 weeks old and I've been trying to get him on formula so I can stop pumping, however he's only eating about 1/2oz of formula at a time and then when I switch to breastmilk he eats 3oz of that! He's usually a really content baby with no fussing and since Ive started the formula and breastmilk switch he's been fussy and up a lot! Does anyone have any tips on how to switch from breast milk to formula and why doesn't he eat as much formula as he does breast milk? I know formula is thicker and holds them longer however I dont think a 1/2oz of formula is even comparable in ration to 3oz of breast milk! Anyone else have these problems? Please Help!

20090205142811AAbp1hR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Am I too late at getting her to sleep alone?? HELP!?	My daughter is 16 months old, and she has been sleeping in our bed since she was born. At first she just didnt sleep at all, so we just slept in cycles. She didnt even sleep all night until she was about six months old, and we moved to our new apartment.       Now, she sleeps through the night, but she still freaks out everytime we try and put her in her own bed. I tried just letting her cry herself to sleep, but it took her like 45 mins to an hour, then she slept for about 20 minutes. She woke up and started screaming again. We also tried putting her to sleep and then moving her to her own bed, but she wakes up screaming and comes back to our bed.      It is ruining my husband and my sex life, and is really starting to get un-comfortable to have her flipping around between us all night.       I really want to get her in her own bed, but I just dont know if we waited to long to do it..
