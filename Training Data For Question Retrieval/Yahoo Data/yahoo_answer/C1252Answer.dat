bAfYkeAdaa	Good observation and good question.<br>  <br>  Stepping back, let's look at the equation for a line: y = mx + b.<br>  <br>  What that means is that the value of y is equal to the sum of two different curves (here the "curves" are straight lines).  The first curve or line is one with slope m and passing through the origin. If you pick any two points on the line you can calculate the rise-over-run and find that it is equal to m.<br>  <br>  The second curve is the straight line y= b. It is just a flat line passing through the point y=b.<br>  <br>  If you draw both those curves and at each value of x add the two values of y, you will see the expected line y=mx + b with y-intercept b and slope m.<br>  <br>  A final point before moving onto quadratics.  y = mx + b can also be written y = mx^1 + bx^0.  I point it out so you can see the pattern that is about to follow.<br>  <br>  A quadratic equation is one in the form y = ax^2  + bx + c, which is the same as y = ax^2 + bx^1 + cx^0. Now notice that y is the sum of three values.  Since we already know the last two terms make a straight line, a quadratic is the sum of a line (bx + c) and a parabola (ax^2), always.<br>  <br>  But what about the graph? In the case of the line, notice that the "mx" term dominated the shape of the the final graph y = mx + b.  This comes from the slope m line dominating the zero slope line y = b.  For the quadratic the slope of the ax^2 term dominates the slope m of the line components of the curve.  Without going into details, the slope of the parabola is 2ax so as x gets bigger so does the slope so no matter how big the constant m is, 2ax will eventually be bigger.<br>  <br>  Key here is that the rise-over-run is not constant. as it is with a straight line. This gives the curve its curve.<br>  <br>  Some additional observations:<br>  If you break down the  line equation into a new equation of the slopes of the components you get y' [read "y prime'] = m + 0.<br>  y' for the quadratic y  = ax^2  + mx + b  [ I renamed just to show we are still talking about a parabola + a line]: y' = 2ax + m + 0.<br>  <br>  Notice that y' for the constant is zero, y' for the line is constant and y' for the quadratic is a line.<br>  <br>  Do you see a pattern?|`|20B68c1iaa	When you square a number, it always ends up positive. <br>  Take the equation <br>  <br>  y = x^2<br>  <br>  When x = -1, y will equal 1. <br>  When x = -2, y will equal 4.<br>  And so on and so on.|`|Ub13idWZaa	Try settings x to a few values, like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

k5Ece8BTaa	A caldera collapse is usually triggered by the emptying of the magma chamber beneath the volcano, as the result of a large volcanic eruption. If enough magma is erupted, the emptied chamber will not be able to support the weight of the volcanic edifice (the mountain) above. Fractures will form around the edge of the chamber, usually in a roughly circular shape. These ring fractures may in fact serve as volcanic vents. As the magma chamber empties, the center of the volcano within the ring fractures begins to collapse. The collapse may occur as the result of a single massive eruption, or it may occur in stages as the result of a series of eruptions. The total amount of collapse may be hundreds or thousands of square meters.|`|VkCrdtJkaa	The largest and most explosive volcanic eruptions eject tens to hundreds of cubic kilometers of magma onto the Earth's surface. When such a large volume of magma is removed from beneath a volcano, the ground subsides or collapses into the emptied space, to form a huge depression called a caldera. <br>  <br>  <br>  Some calderas are more than 25 kilometers in diameter and several kilometers deep.<br>  Calderas are among the most spectacular and active volcanic features on Earth. Earthquakes, ground cracks, uplift or subsidence of the ground, and thermal activity such as hot springs, geysers, and boiling mud pots are common at many calderas. Such activity is caused by complex interactions among magma stored beneath a caldera, ground water, and the regional buildup of stress in the large plates of the Earth's crust. Significant changes in the level of activity at some calderas are common; these new activity levels can be intermittent, lasting for months to years, or persistent over decades to centuries. Although most caldera unrest does not lead to an eruption, the possibility of violent explosive eruptions warrants detailed scientific study and monitoring of some active calderas.<br>  Recently, scientists have recognized volcanic unrest at two calderas in the United States, Long Valley Caldera in eastern California and Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. Whether unrest at these calderas simply punctuates long periods of quiet or is the early warning sign of future eruptions is an important but still unanswered question.

Xx2Iu5FXaa	The doppler effect is the change in wavelength due to motion towards or away from you. The wavelength of light is affected, just like the wavelength of sound.<br>  <br>  Astronomers measure the doppler effect by looking at where the absorption lines in a star's spectrum are relative to where they should be.|`|Tiph3lQcaa	The light from stars has a spectrum that can be carefully evaluated. By looking at the spectrum, astronomers can see specific lines at certain frequencies that represent the chemical composition of the star that is creating the light. Hydrogen is usually very abundant, for example, and it has a discrete set of spectral lines that definitely indicate its presence. <br>  <br>  However, there are some spectra, primarily from distant galaxies, that show similar spectra, but with these discrete patterns shifted up or down from the normal frequency of a hydrogen spectrum. A Doppler Shift does exactly that. The speed of the light does not change, but its frequency (or wavelength) does - due to the Doppler effect. A source that is approaching will show a shorter wavelength and a higher frequency (a shift toward the blue end of the spectrum or a blue shift). A source that is receding from us will show a longer wavelength and a lower frequency (red shift). The amount of the red shift can be used to determine the relative radial velocity of the source - in approach or recession. All of the galaxies except for a few very close ones exhibit a significant red shift - which indicates that they are all receding from us.|`|Sv6pzP36aa	Errm..I am only 15 years old, but think that u mean the expansion  and contraction of time and space.

I somehow think that they measure speeds in light years that have something to do within distance. As we know, if you where standing millions of light years away from the eart, and had a telescope good enough to see earth's land right this instant, u would be staring at the prehistoric times as light from the earth, takes long to get there, and that light is from earths atmosphere millions of years ago.

Make sure and get a good background in biology, zoology, and ecology so you are knowledgeable about all sorts of organisms.  You can specialize in mammalogy and wolves if you go on to get a Masters degree and do your thesis on wolves, but as an undergrad you should be more flexible.  Sure, take any opportunities you can find to work with wolves while still in school and study them on your own..but make sure you have something to fall back on if your dream of working with wolves never becomes a reality.  There are only so many jobs available working with these animals. If you have a wolf sanctuary, or zoo in your area that has wolves, look into their volunteer and internship programs.  Once at a university seek out the professor there that does research with carnivores and try to get involved.|`|84XNkFpCaa	A few things come to mind here.<br>  <br>  You could look up the nearest zoo in your area and see what sort of requirements they have to become a zookeeper. Although it's usually a competitive job and you don't always get to pick your exhibit, you can request to be assigned to one if the opportunity arises. If this doesn't interest you as a career (for that reason or others) you could simply volunteer there if they have a volunteer program and ask to work with the wolf keeper (assuming they have them; most places do, however.) I am currently volunteering at my local zoo (2 months, now,) and I have met some great people and some great birds- I work with the birds of prey. Expanding on this, you could also become a Zoo Vet, and like the name implies, take care of sick/injured animals at the zoo.<br>  <br>  If the zoo life doesn't suit you, you could also try volunteering/working at wildlife rehabilitation centers (where you would nurse injured animals back to health and help them get back to the wild).<br>  <br>  I'm sure if you keep looking into careers down this path you will find a whole lot more than I've offered.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

SvmZlLdaaa	Lions have been called 'the king of beasts' for centuries, due to their majestic appearance and position as a top predator. In addition, male lions stalking among their females and cubs may remind humans of a king lording it over his subjects. As people have become more and more 'civilised' and lost touch with nature, it has become common to call any wild animals 'jungle animals' - hence, the king of beasts becomes king of the jungle.<br>  <br>  Whilst it's true that the majority of lions live on the open plains of Africa, there is a small population of Asiatic lions in the Gir Forest of India, and this subspecies was once much more widespread in Asia. These lions are probably more fitting of the title king of the jungle than their African cousins, but equally there are other majestic top predators, like tigers, that could also be considered deserving of the title.<br>  <br>  Today, lions and tigers do not live in the same areas - there are no tigers in the Gir Forest, and they have never occurred in Africa. Before the range of the Asiatic subspecies of lion was drastically reduced by hunting and habitat loss, however, the ranges of the two cats did overlap. They would have tried to avoid each other whenever possible, since conflict would be bad news for both, but there's little doubt that fights would have occurred now and then. In these cases, one would probably have backed down before either was badly hurt.<br>  <br>  There are numerous records of fights between these species in captivity, since many people in the past have cruelly pitted them against each other in cages where neither could back down and retreat. In some cases the tiger wins, in some cases the lion. The outcome of such a fight depends on the individuals involved - their age, size, sex, health, experience, temperament, etc. Tigers are generally larger and stronger, but size and strength are not the only determining factors - a large but timid tiger would be likely to lose to a small but aggressive lion, even though it was stronger. Lions usually have more fighting experience - they often clash with other prides, whereas tigers tend to avoid conflict whenever possible. Also, the lion's mane (provided it is a male, of course) would offer some degree of protection against a fatal throat-bite. It wouldn't make the killing bite impossible by any means, but it would certainly make it more difficult to achieve and hold.|`|781f1b49265b1eed1172c3bab9e54872aa	probably because of the male lion's mane<br>  they seem more fierce, but yes the tiger is much larger, and more powerful<br>  and while jungle book was a good movie, it was nothing compared to the Lion King<br>  Lion will always have that crown, it doesnt make tigers less superior<br>  they are all apart of the Big Cats: Tigers, Lions, Leopards, & Jaguars|`|YZqDpBGUaa	well the lions that everyone knows about live in africa, and tigers are asian.  so tigers are king of the jungle in asia.  hehe|`|4xMg5dYCaa	The movie Lion King explains the process in detail.|`|cknwN2Fpaa	Tigers don't live in the same area lions do.|`|q1QyM0Kzaa	NB - Asiatic lions don't count, because they're not african lions and thus irrelevant.<br>  <br>  a) lions and tigers rarely (seeing as they come from different continents) meet in the wild, and as such, have had little real oppurtunity to say who's boss.<br>  <br>  b) Lions live in family groups which kind of resembles modern monarchy, possibly with less inbreeding from the cats, though. As tigers do not, aside from when rearing young, get so much experience at teamwork, a tiger who randomly attacked a lion, if both were otherwise behaving naturally, would have to deal with a fair amount more retailiation.<br>  <br>  c) There's a fairly wobbly line between some of Africa's "open forests" and rainforest.

E0U2yII3aa	Absolute visual magnitude is how bright any star would appear if we are all gonna place them at a standard distance, say 10 parsecs or approximately 32.616 light-years. Luminosity or bolometric magnitude on the other hand tells how much energy a star pours out in all available spectrums. Absolute visual magnitude only denotes the amount of electrmagnetic radiation on the visible side of the spectrum where the human eye is sensitive to. Let's give one example. Rigel has an absolute visual magnitude of -6.69 or about 40,000 suns. To compute for bolometric magnitude you need the temperature and the radius of a star. Provided you know the distance to a star, you can already get the absolute visual magnitude. If you apply absolute visual magnitude to the computation of a star like Rigel you'd get a star only about 55 as large as the sun. However, since you know the distance  to Rigel, you can clearly measure how big it would appear. From there, you would see it is 30% larger or about 70 solar radii. You can now conclude that the star should radiate more energy in space than it would be only in visible light. Using the new radius, you'll find that Rigel shines indeed with as much as 66,000x as the sun does. In reality stars radiate more in the ultraviolet if it is beyond 8,000K and more in the infrared side of the spectrum below 5,000K. Stars between these temperatures mostly radiate most of their light in the visible spectrum so you wouldn't notice much difference between absolute visual magnitude and total luminosity if ever you are to do a computation.|`|jlf1sSrGaa	LUMINOSITY is the total amount of energy that a star radiates each second.<br>  <br>  ABSOLUTE MAGNITUDE is defined as the apparent magnitude a star would have if it were seen from a standard distance of 32.6 light-years (10 parsecs).
jlf1sSrGaa	Astronomers have to use a technique called 'spectroscopic parallax' to determine distance to stars too far away for siimple parallax measurements. Basically, the spectrum of such a distant star and its luminosity will reveal its classification (O,B,A,F,G,K,M,N). The next step is to find where the subject star lies on the HR (Hertzsprung-Russell) diagram. The HR diagram will reveal the apparent magnitude of the star along with its absolute magnitude, and from that its distance can be computed. Spectroscopic parallax is good out to about 163,084 light years which includes most of our Milky Way.|`|qKvnpwL6aa	We can't. We can try to measure how long it takes for light from the star to reach us, but other than that we can just estimate.|`|cKzfxE0Zaa	If it's a Cepheid variable star, or a star physically associated with a Cepheid variable star, then the distance can be found from the period luminosity relation:<br>  M = -2.81 log P - 1.43<br>  where...<br>  M is the Cepheid's average absolute visual magnitude<br>  P is the Cepheid's period in days<br>  The distance modulus equation:<br>  m - M = 5 log d - 5<br>  d = 10^[ 0.2 (m-M) + 1 ]<br>  where...<br>  m is the Cepheid's average apparent visual magnitude<br>  d is the distance of the Cepheid variable star in parsecs<br>  Putting the equations together, we get...<br>  d = 10^[ 0.2 m + 0.562 log P + 1.286 ]<br>  d = (19.32 parsecs) (P^0.562) 10^(m/5)<br>  d = (63.01 light years)  (P^0.562) 10^(m/5)<br>  For example, the star Eta Aquilae is a Cepheid variable having a period of 7.176641 days and an apparent visual magnitude of +3.88.<br>  d = (63.01 light years) (3.0271) (5.9704) = 1139 light years<br>  Wikipedia gives 1200 lightyears as the distance, which is close enough to see that the equation works well.<br>  <br>  Main sequence stars of spectral types O and B can be used to get rough distance estimates. The spectral type, along with observed color index information [(B-V) and (U-B)], gives an estimate of the star's absolute magnitude, which can be input along with the visual magnitude into the distance modulus equation, resulting in the estimated distance. So if a star cluster has any of these O or B stars in it, its distance can be approximated.|`|D5QgyGbXaa	Sometimes we can estimate its intrinsic brightness from its spectral classification, and compare that to its apparent brightness.  Some are Cephid variable stars, which pulsate at a rate in proportion to their true brightness.  Once the true and apparent brightnesses can be compared, a distance estimate can be made.<br>  Some stars are in bunches like globular or open clusters, or even another galaxy.  If the distance to that grouping is roughly known, the star's distance can be judged to be the same if it shares gravitational influence or proper motion (velocity with respect to us).

Mitosis results in an exact copy of the parent. but meiosis results in variation because of the crossing over of the genes; this is called Chaismata.<br>  <br>  When going through meiosis, the DNA strands show up X's. and they make and exact copy of this. so imagine two of these. X (the original) and X (the daughter/copy). right? great. during meiosis, they cross over - they look like this XX but instead they overlap, and exchange genes. then they separate (called anaphase stage.)<br>  <br>  Why is this important?  well, this might be confusing, but genes are responsible for the expression of ALL characteristics of all living things.

Their genes have been exchanged with each other - so therefore they are not the same.<br>  This happens in producing sperm.<br>  So each sperm will be different (genetically speaking) and therefore the genes that is passed on will not be the same as the father - and then there's the mother's genetic make up to consider too.<br>  there is also an aspect where some genes can be passed on from their grandparents too, which causes variation.<br>  This is all part of Genetics and Variation. look it up online, Im sure you might get diagrams to help u too =D|`|XLVRRtBaaa	Crossing over allows more possible combimations to genes. For example, genes that lie next to each other will cross over together but genes that are further away will not. So, not only do you have two copies of a gene (two chomosomes) but you also have almost endless possibilities that can be on those chromosomes.
q1QyM0Kzaa	Iron (iii) chloride is FeCl3, right?<br>  <br>  so Iron's atomic mass is about 55.8, so you've got just about 0.5 mol of iron, and just over 1 mol of chlorine (atoms), which means that you can only form 1/3 mol of FeCl3, so 1/2-1/3 = 1/6 mol of iron remaining, work that out as 9.3 g, while the mass of 1/3 mol of FeCl3 is about 18.6+35.5 = 54.1 (i think?)<br>  <br>  the second one I'm way too tired to even look at.

9FAb3CoGaa	In a way, yes to both.  Two basic mechanisms pull or push the water up through the plant.<br>  1) Root pressure- the roots keep absorbing nutrients and water continuously so the water is pushed up so it has a place to go.<br>  2) Transpiration (when water leaves the plant through the leaves) pulls the water up.  When water leaves the plant through the leaves, more water is pulled up like a chain because water is cohesive (sticks to itself).<br>  This is your answer in laymans terms.

ejodXS5naa	It's because the shower curtain thinks you're cute.  Shower curtains are always so perverted.<br>  <br>  But, to be honest, it has to do with air currents.  Nick said that it was due to hot air rising.  Hot air does rise, but this is not why shower curtains come in.  That phenomena occurs when you take a cold shower as well, where there is no hot air.  The real reason is that the water pushes the air, causing a current.  This faster air takes up less transverse volume.  That creates a vacuum that sucks in more air to make up that lost transverse volume.  This air comes from outside the shower (as well as inside the shower), which pulls the curtain with it.|`|AA10287830	Nick answered your question as good as or better than I could.  When I buy a new shower curtain I always trim the bottom with pinking shears so the water rolls off and doesn't collect mildew.  I also sew a small magnet into the 2 bottom corners of the curtain.  This keeps the shower curtain from clinging to your wet body and keeps it in place the duration of your shower.  The last shower curtain I bought had magnets already sewn in so I guess my idea wasn't as original as I had thought:)|`|RtiFapkcaa	lmfaooooooo! Yes!|`|a40weoqtaa	hot, humid air is much lighter than cool, dry air.  As the light air in the shower rises, cooler, heavier air must displace it.  Since it is heavier, it tries to come in from the bottom and pushes against the curtain--giving you the feeling that it wants to cling to you.<br>  <br>  This can be fixed by installing heavier curtains or a shower door.

Unfortunately, there is too little information to answer this problem, since we don't know the shape of the patch. I would answer this "Not enough info." However, let's assume that like most patches, it is rectangular.<br>  <br>  "Find dimensions of the raspberry patch if the total area is to be 192 square feet."<br>  <br>  Let ? = the length of the raspberry patch in ft · fencing<br>  ∴ w = 192 (ft · fencing)2/? = the width of the raspberry patch.<br>  <br>  This is because, the formula for area is:<br>  A = ?w<br>  <br>  Solving for the width gives us:<br>  w = A/?<br>  <br>  And plugging in our area gives us the width that we said.<br>  <br>  Continuing… "A gardener wishes to enclose her raspberry patch with 40ft of fencing."<br>  <br>  Let's plug this into the perimeter equation. But wait! "The raspberry bushes are planted along a garage, as no fencing is needed on that side."<br>  <br>  This complicates things, that means that we need to take into account the garage, which we don't have any information about.<br>  <br>  Let's assume that the garage side is the size of one of the patch sides. We will solve for both that side being a length and for it being a width.<br>  <br>  So instead of P = 2(? + w), we will be using P = ? + 2w and P = 2? + w respectively.<br>  <br>  Garage takes up a length:<br>  40 ft · fencing = ? + 2 · 192 (ft · fencing)2/?<br>  <br>  Multiply through.<br>  40 ft · fencing = ? + 384 (ft · fencing)2/?<br>  <br>  Multiply both sides by the length.<br>  40? ft · fencing = ?2 + 384 (ft · fencing)2<br>  <br>  Subtract 40? ft · fencing.<br>  ?2 ? 40? ft · fencing + 384 (ft · fencing)2 = 0<br>  <br>  We will need two numbers that add up to ?40 ft · fencing and multiply to 384 (ft · fencing)2. 384 has factors 2^7·3. Quick maths tell us that the answers are ?16 and ?24 ft · fencing.<br>  <br>  (? ? 16 ft · fencing)(? ? 24 ft · fencing) = 0<br>  ? = { 16, 24 } ft · fencing<br>  <br>  Plug that into the width.<br>  w = { 12, 8 } ft · fencing<br>  <br>  Garage takes up a width:<br>  40 ft · fencing = 2? + 192 (ft · fencing)2/?<br>  <br>  Multiply by ?/2.<br>  20? ft · fencing = ?2 + 96 (ft · fencing)2<br>  <br>  Subtract 20? ft · fencing.<br>  ?2 ? 20? ft · fencing + 96 (ft · fencing)2 = 0<br>  (? ? 8 ft · fencing)(? ? 12 ft · fencing) = 0<br>  ? = { 8, 12 } ft · fencing<br>  <br>  However, prior knowledge to our last answer tells us that this would make the length lower than the width, and length has to be higher than width. So this won't work.<br>  <br>  We have two answer still though. Either length and width are 16 and 12 feet of fencing respectively, are they are 24 and 8 feet of fencing respectively.<br>  <br>  I'd still go with "Not enough info." at this time :-P<br>  <br>  2. "The manager of a movie theater finds that if he charges $2.50 per person, for the matinee and the average daily attendance is 4,000 people. With every increase of 25 cents, the average daily attendance drops to an average of 200 people."<br>  <br>  I assume that they mean that it drops by an average of 200 people.<br>  <br>  Let r = admission rate in dollars · movie/person ∴ p(r) = the number of people.<br>  <br>  Although, we let the admission rate be measured in dollars · movie/person, we will simply use dollars/person for most of the problem to reduce on complexity as much as possible. We will save that unit for the answer :-)<br>  <br>  We will use a simple slope-point formula to find the relation. We already know the slope, m, is ?200 people2/$0.25￠ or ?800 people2/dollar, that the initial rate (r1) value is $2.50, and that the number of people is 4,000 people at that rate.<br>  p(r) ? p(r1) = (r ? r1)m<br>  p(r) ? 4,000 people = 2,000 people ? 800r people2/dollar<br>  p(r) = 6,000 people ? 800r people2/dollar<br>  <br>  2: I know strange, right? How do you square a person? :-P But this is because the rate isn't measured in dollars, but rather dollars per person, so if you multiply ?800 people/dollar by any rate, you won't have a unit, but ?800 people2/dollar will result in a people unit. That the world of quadratics and rates! :-)<br>  <br>  Now we can change our let statement:<br>  Let r = admission rate in $ · movie/person ∴ p = 6,000 people ? 800r people2/dollar = the number of people.<br>  <br>  "What admission will bring in revenue of $11,250?"<br>  <br>  We would've written this as p(r)r = $11,250, but now we have p = 6,000 people ? 800r people2/dollar instead of p(r), so:<br>  (6,000 people ? 800r people2/dollar)r = $11,250<br>  6,000r people ? 800r2 people2/dollar = $11,250<br>  <br>  Multiply both sides by $/50 to cancel out common factors.<br>  $120r people ? 16r2 people2 = $2225<br>  <br>  Note: the square dollars.<br>  <br>  Add 16r2 people2 ? $120r people to both sides:<br>  16r2 people2 ? $120r people + $2225 = 0<br>  <br>  Looking at this gives us a rather special a2 ? 2ab + b2 = (a ? b)2 equation, 16r2 people2 = (4r people)2, $2225 = ($15)2, $120r people = 2(4r people·$15). Use that to your advantage.<br>  <br>  16r2 people2 ? $120r people + $2225 = 0<br>  (4r people ? $15)2 = 0<br>  <br>  Split it up.<br>  (4r people ? $15)(4r people ? $15) = 0<br>  <br>  Solve:<br>  4r = $15<br>  <br>  r = $3.75￠ · movie/person is the answer to our first question. "The admission of three dollars and seventy-five cents per movie per person will bring in a revenue of $11,250."<br>  <br>  "How many people will buy tickets at this price?"<br>  <br>  Plug the admission into the number of people, shave off the "movie" label to not complicate things.<br>  p = 6,000 people ? 800($3.75￠/person) people2/dollar<br>  p = 3,000 people is our second answer. "Three thousand people will buy tickets at this price."<br>  <br>  E-mail me for checks I've already done, so the answers are guaranteed.

2lQ8DJAcaa	A mid-ocean ridge or mid-oceanic ridge is an underwater mountain range, formed by plate tectonics.<br>  <br>  This uplifting of the ocean floor occurs when convection currents rise in the mantle beneath the oceanic crust and create magma where two tectonic plates meet at a divergent boundary.<br>  <br>  The mid-ocean ridges of the world are connected and form a single global mid-oceanic ridge system that is part of every ocean, making the mid-oceanic ridge system the longest mountain range in the world, with a total length of about 60,000 km.<br>  <br>  There are two processes, ridge-push and slab-pull, thought to be responsible for the spreading seen at mid-ocean ridges, and there is some uncertainty as to which is dominant.<br>  <br>  Ridge-push occurs when the weight of the ridge pushes the rest of the tectonic plate away from the ridge, often towards a subduction zone.|`|RDiwPDAjaa	The mid-oceanic ridge is formed by a convection cycle of the earth's mantle.  The magma rises to the earth's surface and along a weak point of the oceanic crust (and in some cases, the continental crust (San Andreas and Iceland), the magma breaks through creating a volcanic mountain range that, as its been explained many times, forms an intricate mountain range that looks like a baseball seam around the earth.  It is the largest geologic formation on earth, and measures approximately 40,000 miles long.  <br>  The ridge that forms is like a rift valley (or spreading center) and is considered a divergent boundary.  This moves the oceanic crust away from its center.  I could go on and on, but I think thats all you want to know.
SvmZlLdaaa	It would depend on the animal. In order for two different species to be able to interbreed, they must be closely related - usually within the same genus, and at least within the same family. This means that they shared an ancestor with each other more recently than with other animals, and thus share much of the same genetic material. Beyond family level, two species cease to share enough genetic material for the egg and sperm to 'recognise' each other, which is why you can't breed animals from different families like, say, a dog and a cat - a dog sperm simply wouldn't be able to fertilise a cat egg, and vice versa. You certainly could not crossbreed a human and a hippo - they are not only in different families, but different orders, not to mention the physical difficulties involved!<br>  <br>  It is likely humans could interbreed with at least some of the great apes. We are in the same family, and genetically speaking should be in the same genus as chimpanzees and bonobos. We are more closely related to them than horses and donkeys or lions and tigers are to each other, and these species are able to interbreed - our placing ourselves in a separate genus to all other animals is more about human arrogance than it is about genetics. It is rumoured that a certain scientist once impregnated a chimp with his own sperm, but got cold feet and destroyed the animal before the offspring was born. A human-chimp hybrid is never likely to happen for moral and ethical reasons, and a good thing too - imagine an animal with the strength and aggression of a chimp and the intelligence and capacity for evil of a human. It'd be lethal.<br>  <br>  For those who said animals need the same number of chromosomes to be able to breed, this is not actually the case. Horses and donkeys have different numbers of chromosomes, and can interbreed to produce mules and hinnies. Lions and tigers have different numbers of chromosomes, and can interbreed to produce ligers and tigons. The difference in chromosome number of the parent species is the reason many hybrids are sterile - it means the hybrid cannot produce functional sex cells - but it does not prevent the existence of the hybrid.|`|nO7Ie91laa	ummmmmmm wow,<br>  no, nothing will happen probably since we are to far away from hat certain species (in your case a human to a hippo) <br>  thats why lions and tigers can mate since the are both felines<br>  but the off spring will not be able to reproduce,<br>  we also need the same amount of chromosomes (46)|`|q1QyM0Kzaa	First of all, you need help.<br>  Now a question - are you aware of (insert the nearest region to you where sheep are farmed)?<br>  <br>  You may be aware that there are not sheep-human hybrids wandering around. <br>  <br>  It was once believed that humans have successfully mated with chimps to give rise to the Bush dynasty. However, IQ tests of humans, Chimps, and bushes prove that it really was just someone have sex with a brick that produced America's most recent ex-president. lol.<br>  <br>  In a nutshell - like horses and domkeys, it is possible for closely related species to interbreed. However, the definition of species rules that this will not be an entirely successful union unless the two parents are of the same species.<br>  <br>  And if a girl started playing with a hippo's wedding tackle, odds are on he wouldn't much appreciate it.|`|pRF5LLloaa	Since humans and animals have completely different numbers of chromosomes, there is no possibility of producing a live "mixed" baby.<br>  <br>  The sperm, passed from the male into the female, would simply be rejected as a "foreign object".  This MIGHT make the female sick, or it might not.|`|hR1hsdthaa	Humans are animals stupid.<br>  <br>  Also it probably wouldn't be fun having sex with a dog.<br>  <br>  Just ask a redneck|`|hFnkvO9taa	?????????? filthy f***ING  P E R V E R T !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...

F6IOLf3Aaa	To understand the truth, it requires a certain kind of mindset, a lot of dedicated hard work and study in areas like advanced mathematics (chaos and fractal theory), quantum mechanics and quantum wave physics, classical physics, biology, particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology; just to name a few categories.<br>  <br>  From this, you can begin to understand and learn to recognize the patterns in nature that first unfolded at the big bang origin of the universe 14 billion years ago. In short, all dynamic living things are simply scaled up, phase transitioned, guantitized repeat of event at the origin of the universe.  For example, all origins, no matter what it may be, has its "spark" in the subatomic virtual particles that appear out of the vaccum for a brief time, release energy, change forms and then drop back into the vacuum.  It is the same with radio active decay in certain heavy atoms; energy is releasted and the atom changes form. Such as it is on the phase-transitioned larger scale; life drops into our reality, grows and generates energy, changes form and then dies, dropping out of our reality again.  Take the origin of the universe for example, it started out in a tiny, tiny high energy, low entropy state, exploded with an every expanding burst of energy; went through phase transitions, matter and energy formed and collected by gravity, energy started slowing and dropping, entropy started to rise, one day all the conserved energy in the universe will equal the amount of entropy in it and the universe will die.  So it is with all life including human life and the evolution of life: we start out as a tiny high energy low entropy egg cell, fertilization comes about and then growth, we proceed through various phase transitions and changes, energy start decreasing, entropy starts increasing, we undergo rapid growth then age, and when our biological energy equal the rising entropy in our body and cells, we die.<br>  <br>  It is as simply as that.  The above is just one or two examples of how everything that is in our large 4-dimensional reality has its most basic roots "origins" in the quantum effects of the big bang sinularity. All things in our large 4-D world and universe has their counterparts (the spark that caused the origin) at the atomic and subatomic levels.  It is the "phase-transtions" that ultimately link our large world with that of the tiny quantum world.  It is just a matter of being able to read the patterns written largely across our universe, our world, and life, and seeing their connection with the tiny realm of the quantum.|`|JTf3mptdaa	because the snake was possessed by Satan. God's fruit wasn't magic, it was symbolic. God told Adam and Eve not to eat the fruit. eating it would be rebelling against God, thus giving humans the opportunity to sin. A jealous Lucifer, angry at man, lured Eve, who in turn lured Adam, into eating the fruit. The veil that prevented man from knowing sin was lifted and possibly changed us on a genetic level enabling all humans to know sin. Evolution says that everything magically arranged itself from a rock.|`|MVx9BYkpaa	I'm still wondering how folded protiens became encoded into the genomes of life. Until evolutionist figure it out, I'll remain a skeptic. I would also like to see at least one fossil that was mixed with two species, as scientists have never been able to produce that either. Lastly, I would like know that they have actually witnessed speciation (a new species coming into existence) before I'll believe their "missing links monkey theory". I'm all about facts and proof--and there is none.|`|JgIXsKGGaa	welllllll for me, there is evidence of evolution. but there is no real evidence of the talking snake...well...that I know of anyway.|`|qph06N5uaa	If you really think about it evalution is bogus and the snake was just the devil in snake form|`|hEq4R96Uaa	Neither of them are a ridiculous idea. Evolution happens regardless if people want to believe it or not. personally i believe in GOD and in evolution not all of it but much of it makes sense. at first i didn't believe in evolution but i've seen it in frogs. and it didn't take billions fo years. 6000 years is base on the assumptions of ussher Bishop, which can be wrong he is not GOD. and also GOD exist i can't give physical evidence of it but I know he does. And i Follow his word. not part of it.|`|X4EBNoNUaa	well if one's belief engine is running full tilt they will BELIEVE what they wish irrespective of evidence to the contrary. Science is not based on belief but evidence obtained by experimentation , hypothesis testing, including  falsification tests . Most creationists , I am sure, would want much more evidence to prove their guilt or innocence of a charge brought against them in court than merely words in a book  ...a book written by scientifically illiterate men who BELIEVED the Earth was flat, the center of the Universe, demons caused diseases, and magic was real.  At the end of the day..what one believes matters not...what does the evidence say? To reject massive amounts of convergent evidence regarding evolution because a person has a personal incredulity issue is nonsensical..especially when most of the naysayers do not know the first thing about evolution except for the obfuscation, and prevarication espoused by answersingenesis...

AA10164889	We are hoping that what you mean is the electric watt-hour meter such as the one attached to the outside of your house, so that the electric company can read the amount of electricity you use from one month to the next.<br>  <br>  The watt-hour meter is essentially a low-torque electric motor designed to be very sensitive to the amount of electric current passing through it.  The more current, the faster the motor turns.<br>  <br>  The motor is then geared to a series of dial indicators so that the amount of electricity used to date is shown on the dials.  The electric utility takes the current reading and subtracts the previous reading to determine how much electricity you used between readings.|`|BrarMA1Haa	There is a good explanation at the attached link.  Scroll down to "Technology".<br>  <br>  The meter has two coils in it, one responsive to voltage, the other to current.  They are arranged so that the torque they apply to the disc is proportional to the voltage times the current times the cosine of the phase angle so that the disc only responds to active power (kWh) and not to reactive power (kVAR).

KHSOVxViaa	In the visible spectrum, any large telescope can collect a lot more light than the human eye, so can "see" much fainter objects.  Furthermore, the wider diameter of the mirror can resolve much finer detail than the human eye.<br>  <br>  The amount of light collected is proportional to the surface area, and the resolution is proportional to the diameter.  Above the atmosphere, the "seeing" is much better as there is no turbulent air, dust or water vapour to affect visibility.  Detectors can collect light over a period of time, that also increases the range of what becomes visible.<br>  <br>  Telescopes are also designed to see at other wavelengths, from ultraviolet through infrared and millimetre wave up to radio telescopes.  There's the famous microwave "horn" used to detect the cosmic background radiation.  There are even devices designed to image gamma ray emissions.<br>  <br>  Any of this useful?|`|D5QgyGbXaa	Your eye has an entrance lens that is a quarter inch in diameter.  If you use a 6 inch telescope, you can focus light so that things (3/.125)^2 times or about 600 times fainter can be seen.  Larger ones can see even fainter things.  Eye limit for dark adapted, under clear sky without light pollution can see to magnitude 6.  With an 8 inch scope, up to 14th, and with a 60 inch scope on Mt Wilson ($900 a night rental), about 23rd magnitude.  Each five magnitudes is 100x fainter.<br>  Now put a CCD camera on the scope, and exposure time for human eye retina of a tenth of a second becomes ten minutes for cameras, or 6000 times longer, and as many photons more.  And the eye is not very efficient, maybe 5 to 15% QE, and cameras are up to 60 to 80% QE (Quantum Efficiency, or turning photons into electrons to become a signal).<br>  Then put the telescope into space, where there is no atmosphere to filter out the ultraviolet and xrays.  And there is no water vapor to absorb infrared.  One can see objects with a broader spectrum of radiation, and learn more.<br>  Back on earth, one can combine light from several telescopes to create one that is more than 100m across in aperture for high definition.<br>  Then there are radio telescopes, which can be 1000 feet across, or a square kilometer or in a group of two dozen miles apart, or 8000 miles apart, and cooperate to view the same object.|`|0i80jUKeaa	A telescope doesn't "see" anything at all, all it does is enlarges what the naked eye sees.  Light from a very distant object is confined to a very small portion of your eye's field of view, which makes the object appear small, in some cases, too small for your eye to make out.  A telescope is basically a concave lens (or series of concave lenses) that diffract the light that enters it into a wider stream of light which makes the distant object appear big enough for you eye to see.  The bigger and more expensive the telescope, the better its ability to do this.|`|NpornPihaa	i dont know but here are some telescopes that you can lick up on the computer to see which one is which(reflecting telescope,refracting telescope,visible light,infrared,hubble space telescope,and i think ULTRAVIOLET TELESCOPES) there you go.

D0JsiC0Paa	Well, it's because of the distributive property that you expand as such;<br>  <br>  (x + 4)(x + 2) = x(x+2)+4(x+2) = x2 + 6x + 8<br>  <br>  The way I learned to make sense of it, was to consider that ok it's called a quadratic equation, an equation of this form, what does that mean? what practical application does this have and why is it arranged as such?

X8LNbaKQaa	Well, since you probably do not have vacuum and glass blowing and silvering equipment, you will have to use what is available.  Heat leaks out through three mechanisms, convection, conduction and radiation.  <br>  <br>  You block convection by using insulation that has very tiny air spaces (so the convection circulation in each is tiny).  In a commercial thermos, they pump out all the air between an inner and outer container, so there is nothing to circulate.  But your choices are things like tissue paper layers, fiberglass or styrofoam.   <br>  <br>  You block conduction by having no short conductive path from inside to outside.  The same low density stuff that blocks convection also has low conductivity.  In a commercial the same vacuum that eliminates convection also eliminates all material that conducts, except there the inner bottle connects with the outer bottle to form the vacuum chamber.  <br>  <br>  You reduce radiation leakage with reflective surfaces like aluminum foil.  You need a couple layers, at least, one in the inner container (shiny side out) to make it hard for the hot stuff to produce radiation, and one on the cold side (shiny side facing in) to reflect heat that leaked out back in.  If you have room, you might gain a little by adding another layer about half way through the insulation, but it may be a net loss if it conducts heat from a warmer spot along the foil to a cooler spot.  Even better than aluminum foil is aluminized plastic film, since it has  good shiny surface, but less metal to conduct edgewise.  It is just about all surface.  There is often good film available as gift wrap.  Colorless is the most reflective, but, since you can't see in the infrared, it is hard to say what other color is best, without an experiment. <br>  <br>  -- <br>  Regards,<br>  <br>  John Popelish|`|hR1hsdthaa	go to wall greenes <br>  buy one<br>  ???<br>  profit

Another example is nitrogen, while a gas at room temperature (you're breathing it now), it can be made a liquid and finally a solid at very low temperatures.|`|KJHw0oI3aa	Any element can be a solid, a liquid, and a gas depending on temperature.  Noble gases have very low boiling points.  That is why they normally exist as gases at room temperature.

9OHskZrhaa	Angiosperms + Gymnosperms = Seed plants. These plants are the only ones that have seeds and pollen. These plants have highly reduced male gametophytes (pollen) that can be transported by the wind or animals to the female gametophyte so that the sperm and egg are close together, and the sperm don't have to swim through open water to reach the egg the way they do for algae, mosses, and most ferns. In fact, in angiosperms, the sperm don't even have flagella. Once the egg fertilized, the embryo is well protected and can go a long time without water before germinating.
1qch9VQMaa	That question doesn't make sense.  Humans have carried their genetic code for years, that is your DNA and your genes, etc.  If what you mean is what influence will the human genome project has, thats a different question but i imagine thats what you mean.  The thing is its really your opinion, so all I can do is give you some background information.  The human genome project sequenced the full genetic code of human beings.  The problem is we're not sure what all the genes do, which ones are remnants and no longer work (pseudogenes), etc.  So the next step is to annotate the genome, which means to find out what all the genes do.  This may hold information about causes of disease and therefore lead us in the direction of cures.  It also means that we might be held accountable for our genetic code if its made public.  Maybe insurance companies will require it and possible lead to genetic prejudice.  So you have to decide.  There are good things and bad things.
Wz9tSKTaaa	I doubt anyone really knows what proportion of genes which affect your strength come from each side of the family.<br>  <br>  That aside, the ironic thing is that whilst girls inherit more or less exactly half their genes from each of their parents, boys inherit more genes from their mothers.<br>  <br>  This is because girls inherit an X chromosome from each parent, whilst boys inherit an X from mum and a Y from dad, and the Y chromosome has far fewer genes on it.|`|b9c206476271de6c0a321ebe042eb7f6aa	Unless you're from an inbred lineage, you get somewhat more than half from your mother's side.<br>  <br>  The "somewhat more than half" is because you're a male, and the X chromosome (from Mom) has more genes than the Y chromosome (from dad).  You also get mitochondrial DNA and other "maternal cytoplasmic inheritance" from Mom.|`|CYtMRC4eaa	It would have to be half and half, since you get 23 chromosomes from your  mother and half from your father.  Now, which genes are expressed is something else, and of those 30,000 genes, it's tough to tell...|`|AJ2EWKFcaa	punnet square.. and its not always the dads side that gets the dominance..<br>  <br>  and just look at yer traits and compare it to yer parents.. :)|`|vDSRgHxDaa	Compare things about yourself with your parents and reletives.|`|OLkdquXAaa	punnet sq|`|aKkDWz5Waa	ur still half and half. both genders always r.<br>  <br>  but (letting u in on genetics here) some genes r more "dominant" than others which means they have a tendency to show more when u inherit them. for instance lets say ur mom has blue eyes nd ur dad has brown eyes, u would be more likely to get the brown eyes, cuz darker genes r usually more dominant, but in reality u still have both in u. u received a blue eye gene from ur mom nd a brown eye gene from ur dad. this means that later on ur child could still have blue eyes if u marry someone with blue eyes. u only pass on one of these genes to the child, nd it might be the blue-eye one. ur wife will definitely pass on a blue eye gene cuz since blue isnt dominant, she must have 2 blue-eye genes to have blue eyes. so if ur baby gets a blue eye gene from u nd one from ur wife, then it can have blue eyes. haha get it?<br>  <br>  actually this is how some ppl mysteriously get unexpected genes like a child suddenly having blond hair after the family's had only brown hair for generations- blond gene, which isnt dominant, stays "hidden" in a string of ppl as it is passed on nd one day, by chance, 2 ppl bring together 2 hidden blond hair genes!!<br>  <br>  actually in case ur interested, the fact that lighter genes rnt dominant is the reason ppl r saying blue eyes will eventually disappear.|`|wl0tK6vyaa	You get exactly 50% of your genes from each parent. If you're male that means you got your Y chromosome from your dad. Now, the traits that you show can be more from one parent than the other one, that depends on which parent has a dominant or recessive allele for a specific trait.|`|QMy7MZCfaa	You get it from the parent who has dominant traits because that parent has two big letters       ex) BB=dominant  bb= recessive|`|nBjQQ3yraa	Who do you act the most like?

Although energy levels are degenerate (ie, all the orbitals with a given n have equal energies) in a Hydrogen atom, electron screening in bigger atoms causes the s orbitals to have less energy than the p orbitals which have less than the d's, etc.<br>  <br>  Fortunately, you can just read the answers off the periodic table.<br>  <br>  So for a) look on the periodic chart and see what fills up first when you look at potassium, calcium, and the first row of transition metals.<br>  <br>  b) is really a no-brainer.

Ivib7aVZaa	Short answer: Yes.<br>  <br>  Long answer: Yes, but it depends what organisms you're talking about, what type of reproduction you're talking about, and whether they're able to merely live or also reproduce, and what stage of reproduction they're in.  For example, you gave two animals that reproduce sexually.  Some organisms, like bacteria, produce asexually and only have one big chromosome.  In humans, there are conditions where someone will have extra chromosomes but will be basically ok (e.g., an extra Y chromosome in a male); but, there are also situations where an extra chromosome not only makes someone sterile but also has very bad side effects during development (e.g. extra 21st chromosome).<br>  <br>  Check out the sources for more examples.<br>  <br>  Cheers =)|`|dmRiRUyyaa	Yes, when you eat seedless bananas, actually you eat triploid (3n) plants. Similarly, now you can enjoy seedless (3n) water melon, because scientists have been successfully to produce triploid (3n) plants by crossing tetraploid (4n) and diploid (2n) plants. <br>  In addition, you can also have haploid (n) plants by culturing microspores/pollens or plant eggs using tissue culture techniques.|`|1VuQNpWbaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Humans with Down's Syndrome have 47 chromosomes.<br>  <br>  This happens during meiosis, when there is an error in the seperation of the chromosomes.

SvmZlLdaaa	Leopards are actually the most common man-eaters of all cats, possibly because of their wide geographic range - they are found across Africa and Asia, making them more likely to encounter people than tigers or lions, which have smaller ranges. Jaguars very rarely attack people, but attacks are known to have occurred. However, in common with other cats, both leopards and jaguars usually do not see humans as prey - it's generally old or injured animals that can no longer hunt their natural prey that turn to man-eating.|`|TuOp3hNPaa	go in the wild an walk up to a jaguar or leopard an see if it attacks u.  but the jauars and leopards have a harder time getting out of the zoo cages and then in the wild more ppl want to go c tigers and lions so theres more close up encounters|`|Lj91uwsZaa	One reason is that jaguars and leopards hunt mostly at night so there is less chance of encountering people.

1qch9VQMaa	In a hypertonic solution, the concentration of solute on the outside of red blood cells would be greater.  So water will flow out of the cell and it will shrink.  If you place it in an isotonic solution nothing will happen, concentrations are equal inside and out.  If placed in a hypotonic solution the concentration inside the cell is greater than outside and therefore water or solvent will rush in and the cell will burst.

dKZmxct3aa	1) Sasha's age = x<br>  Leora's age = x + 2<br>  <br>  Just to explain, Leona's age 8 years ago is equal to 1/3 of Sasha's age 6 years forward.<br>  We know that Leona's age is x - 2 and 8 years ago, gives us (x-2) - 8.<br>  Sasha's age 6 years ahead  is x + 6. It states that Leora's age 8 years ago, which is the statement (x + 2) - 8, is equal to 1/3 of Sasha's age 6 years ahead. Therefore, one-third of Sasha's age 6 years ahead is (x+6) times 1/3<br>  <br>  Hence, the flowing equation.<br>  <br>  ((x + 2) - 8) = x + 6 times 1/3<br>  x - 6 = (x + 6) 1/3<br>  3x - 18 = x + 6 <br>  2x = 24<br>  x = 12<br>  <br>  Therefore, Sasha is 12 and Leora is 14.<br>  <br>  <br>  2. 2x - 2 = Gilmore's age<br>  x = Mr. Baker's age <br>  <br>  Just to explain, Mr Gilmore's age in 5 years time is 9 years younger than three times Mr. Barker's age 4 years ago <br>  Therefore, 2x - 2 + 5 years ahead + 9 years ahead ( I used plus 9, because by adding another nine years to Mr. Gilmore's age in 5 years, the equation will be equal) is equal to three times Barker's age, or 3x - 4 years behind the present time, which gives us 3(x -4).<br>  <br>  Hence the equation:<br>  <br>  (2x - 2) + 5  + 9 = 3(x - 4)<br>  2x -2 + 14 = 3x - 12 <br>  2x + 12 = 3x - 12 <br>  2x + 24 = 3x<br>  x = 24<br>  <br>  Therefore, Mr. Baker is 24 and Mr. Gilmore is 46.<br>  <br>  3) Daughter's age = x<br>  Mom's age = 3x<br>  <br>  Just to explain, four years ago, the mom was 2 years younger than twice her daughter's age in 5 years.<br>  The mother's age, 3x - 4 years ago + 2 years ( since she is 2 younger at this point, we must add 2 years to the mother's age to equate the equations) is equal to her daughter's age, x, plus 5 years ahead, x + 5, times 2, which gives us 2(x + 5).<br>  <br>  Hence:<br>  <br>  3x - 4 + 2 = 2(x + 5)<br>  3x - 2 = 2x + 10<br>  3x = 2x + 12<br>  x = 12<br>  <br>  Therefore the daughter's age is 12 and the mom's age is 36.<br>  <br>  4) Cam's age = x<br>  Sephi's age = 3x<br>  <br>  Just to explain, in 3 years, Sephi will be 6 times as old as Cam was 2 years beforehand. In three years, Sephi will be 3x + 3 years ahead. 3x + 3 (her age in 3 years time) is 6 times greater than x - 2, which is Cam's age 2 years ago. In order to equate the equations, we must divide the first equation by 6 since it was initially 6 times greater.<br>  <br>  Hence the equation:<br>  <br>  3x + 3 divided by 6 = x - 2<br>  Now, times both sides by 6 to get rid of the divided by 6.<br>  3x + 3 = 6(x-2)<br>  3x + 3 = 6x - 12<br>  15 = 3x<br>  x = 5<br>  <br>  Therefore, Cam is 5 and Sephi is 3x = 3(5) = 15 years old.<br>  <br>  5)Talo's age = x<br>  Alt's age = x + 20<br>  <br>  Just to explain, 8 years ago, Talo was one year older than half Alt's age 4 years ago.<br>  Talo's age, 8 years ago, is x - 8<br>  Half Alt's age 4 years ago: (x+20 - 4) times 1/2<br>  Talo's age  8 years before, or x - 8 is one year more than <br>   (x+20 - 4) times 1/2<br>  To equate the equations, me must subtract one year from     x - 8, so the equations will be equal. Now, we have x - 8 - 1<br>  <br>  Hence the equation:<br>  <br>  x - 8 - 1 = (x+20 - 4) times 1/2<br>  x - 9 = (x + 16) times 1/2<br>  Now, we must times both sides by 2, the reciprocal of 1/2 to eliminate the 1/2.<br>  2(x-9) = x + 16<br>  2x - 18 = x + 16<br>  2x = x + 34<br>  x = 34<br>  <br>  Therefore, Talo's age is 34 and Alt's age is 54.<br>  <br>  I got the last answer!!<br>  <br>  Six years ago, Darra was x years.<br>  Six years ago, Lisa was 3x years, since she was 3 times Darra's age 6 years ago.<br>  <br>  2 years ago, Darra was x + 4 years<br>  2 years ago, Lisa was 3x + 4 years<br>  It states that Lisa's age 2 years ago, which is 3x + 4, was 2 years younger than twice Darra's age, which would be        2(x + 4)<br>  Now, we must add 2 years to Lisa's years in order to equate both sides, since she is 2 years younger.<br>  <br>  Hence the equation:<br>  <br>  3x + 4 + 2 = 2(x +4)<br>  3x + 6 = 2x + 8<br>  x = 2<br>  <br>  Therefore, Dara's age 6 years ago was 2, so her present age is 2 + 6 = <br>  8 years old is her present age.<br>  Lisa's age six years ago was 3x = 6, so her present age is 6 + 6 = 12 years old is her present age.<br>  <br>  If you give me best answer, I'll answer all the rest.<br>  <br>  Please tell me if any of my answers are wrong.

A single black snake can consume dozens of rats in a single year.<br>  <br>  Alligators<br>  They are predators which prey on smaller species. This is nature's way of keeping the population of these smaller species in check. Without predators in our world, there would be too many of the smaller species. <br>  For example, alligators eat raccoons. Too many raccoons in one area could eat all of the fish out of a pond, or all of the berries off a tree. In theory, there wouldn't be enough fish or berries for other species to eat, and then some animals could starve.|`|nRg7mlkSaa	a lot because they eat mice that might come in our home

Its mass number (the sum of protons and neutrons) is about 73.  This means it also has 73 - 32 = 41 neutrons in its nucleus.  The total number of electrons equals the number of protons, or 32.  They are distributed in four principal energy levels as follows: 2-8-18-4.
AA10164889	It has to do with the architecture of the case more than with the electrochemistry of the battery.  Cylindrical batteries (AAA, AA, C and D) have electrodes that serve as the terminals and also the end caps; these are made of brass or copper.<br>  <br>  Encased batteries such as car batteries that have the round terminals on top have terminals made of a lead alloy--notice how easily they are compressed or misshaped.  Alternatively, encased batteries can have terminals made of brass-plated steel.<br>  <br>  This goes for all electrochemical types.  They all use the same type of terminals.

N8HgRKnfaa	2 main reasons:<br>  <br>  First, in regard to the earth, the sun's energy (light) at 90 degrees is less filtered through the atmosphere.<br>  <br>  Second, the intensity is greater anywhere on earth when the surface the sun's rays are striking is tilted at 90 degrees relative to the sun. At an angle the sun's energy is spread over a greater surface area, thus a weaker effect than on a surface at 90 degrees. <br>  <br>  Another way to look at it is that the equator is the closest to 90 degrees to the sun anytime of the year, and the radiation (heat and light) is more intense, thus raising the temperature of that climate. On the other hand a place on earth above the arctic circle (say about 15 degrees tilt away from the sun) is always cooler (on average) because the sunlight falls on it at an oblique angle, thus weakening the effect of the sun.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: It is NOT because the sun is closer because the effect is the same whether the sun is at it's farthest point from earth (perigee) or at it's closest (apogee).|`|xuCY36yWaa	I TAKE IT YOU MEAN ANGLE.

Hopefully something can be done to get you into a better home or get your mother drug-free.  I think maybe the reason the incident when you were four had such an impact on you is the fact that you were so young and he kept making up reasons to whip you again.  It was gratuitous violence and he obviously enjoyed it.  Don't believe him in saying that you were causing it.  That is the prime excuse of abusers.  They always tell their victims that they brought it on themselves, but in reality they do it because it makes them feel powerful.  I hope you get some help to relieve your current situation.

I hope that you will tell your teachers about them.  You can get help dealing with your parents, but you must tell trustworthy adults!<br>  <br>  The first five years of life are the most influential on our personalities.  Most of our personalities form during those first five years.  The psychologist Alfred Adler studied people's earliest recollections and found that they have a long lasting effect.  The emotions you experience in those earliest recollections may influence you for the rest of your life.  They can affect things like whom you choose to marry and which occupation you choose.<br>  <br>  Things about earliest recollections are written for adults, so I'm not sure what you will be able to understand from reading at your age.  The things to search for on the Internet are "earliest recollections" or "early recollections."<br>  <br>  I hope that you will ask your teachers to help you with your parents.  If you do, maybe you will get to talk to a psychologist or social worker about your problems.  You can ask him/her about your early recollections and why they influence you the most.<br>  <br>  I hope things will work out for you.  It really matters what you do to help yourself.

o2MAZAzNaa	Yup, the phenotype is dominant.<br>  It is most likely that both the father and mother are carriers and it looks like it's sex-linked.<br>  The father will most likely have the allele on the y chromosome.<br>  In this case, all male progeny regardless of the allele inherited from the mother will carry the y chromosome and the dominant phenotype nature of the allele will cause all male progeny to be dark.<br>  For the case of a female progeny, it will definately inherit the x chromosome from the father and it will not contain the allele. Hence, it will depend on what is inherited from the mother. Since the mother is a carrier, there will be a 50% chance of inheriting either the normal or affected allele. Hence, the chance for a female progeny to be dark is 50%.|`|liGJqWyHaa	the gene is dominant but the mother or/and father are/is a carrier.

8cdb5b39d4f2c0d0649da4b481f906c9aa	You first need to look at the numbers in front of each species to determine the ratio of each species in the equation. For Example:<br>  <br>  in a) you have [2H2O2(l)]--> 2H2O(l) + O2(g)<br>  <br>  Looking at the numbers in front of the species, you see that in the reaction you:<br>  -consume 2 moles of H2O2(l)<br>  -produce 2 moles of H2O(l)<br>  -produce 1 mole of O2(g)<br>  <br>  *you can see that the number of moles of H2O2 consumed and H2O produced from it is equal (2 moles consumer, 2 moles produced), so if you had only 0.5 moles of H2O2, you would produce 0.5 moles of H2O. The way to solve this mathimatically is to simply create a fraction where the numerator is the number in front of the species you want, and the denominator is the species which you are using to create it (ie, in this case 2/2). You multiply this fraction by the number of moles given (0.5 mol).<br>  <br>  mole ratio is 2:2 (where you have reactant:product)<br>  <br>  *you can see that the number of moles of H2O2 consumed is twice as much as the number of moles of O2 produced; so if you consumed 0.5 moles of H2O2, you only get 0.25 moles of O2. Again, mathematically you can create a fraction of 1/2 (# in front on O2/# in front of H2O2) <br>  <br>  mole ratio is 2:1 (reactanyt:product)<br>  ------------------------<br>  Answer b):<br>  -produce 0.5 moles of KCl (mathematically: 2/2 * 0.5 mol); ratio is 2:2 for reactant:product<br>  -produce 0.75 moles of O2 (mathematically: 3/2 * 0.5 mol); ratio is 2:3 for reactant:product<br>  ------------------------<br>  Questions c) and d) are harder because you have a limiting reactant in this case (in a) and b) you only had one reactanbt, so it was limiting). This means that if you are given 0.5 mol of each of the reactants, you will consume one before you consume the other. The limiting reactant will be the one with the highest number in front of it (because you need more of it relative to the other reactant to convert the other reactant completely into products). To solve these, you name the limiting reactant first, then you only do the ratios for that reactant, since that will determine how much product you can make. <br>  ---<br>  Question c):<br>  <br>  You can see that you need 6 moles of HCl to fully convert the 2 moles of Al, so if you are only given 0.5 mol of HCl and 0.5 mol of Al, you will run out of HCl first (think about it: for every Al, you will need 3 HCl, so if you don't start with 3 times as much HCl then there will be some Al left over when you run out of HCl). <br>  <br>  therefore, your answer is:<br>  -0.5 mol of reactants makes 0.17 mol of AlCl3 (mathematically: 2/6 * 0.5 mol --> remember in your ratio that it is # in front of AlCl3/# in front of HCl) mole ratio is 6 mol HCl:2 mol AlCl3<br>  -0.5 mol of reactants makes 0.25 mol of H2 (mathematically: 3/6 * 0.5 mol); mole ratio is 6:3<br>  <br>  NOTE: all this depends on HCl being the militing reagent, which it is as long as the number of moles of HCl at the start/given to you is less than 3x that of Al<br>  ---<br>  Question d)<br>  <br>  -in this case, O2 is the limiting reagent, since you need 5x as much of it to fully react 1 mole of C3H8<br>  <br>  <br>  Therefore, <br>  -for every 0.5 mole of reagents, you make 0.3 mole of CO2 (mathematically: 3/5 * 0.5 mol); mole ratio is 5:3 (reactant:product)<br>  -for every 0.5 mole of reagents, you make 0.4 moles of H2O (mathematically: 4/5 * 0.5 mol); mole ratio is 5:4 (reactant:product)<br>  <br>  For questions c) and d) I only indicated the important mole ratio (the reagent that is limiting) since the other one is irrelevant. Not sure if your teacher still wants the other one or not. If you still don't get it, try sending me a message through here and i'll try and explain it further.

bqOvdGXxaa	Here are two examples of the simplest series and parallel circuits that exist.<br>  <br>  CAUTION;   Construct these circuits only on paper because they are both short circuits and could be dangerous.<br>  <br>  To construct a series circuit: <br>  Connect a single wire from the negative terminal of a battery to the positive terminal of the same battery. That is all that is required for a series circuit. This offers a single external path for current to flow from one terminal of the battery to the other terminal.<br>  <br>  To construct a parallel circuit: <br>  Just like you constructed the series circuit connect a single wire from the negative terminal of a battery to the positive terminal of the same battery. But don`t quit.  Now connect a second wire from the negative terminal of the battery to the positive terminal of the same battery. Now you have two paths for current to flow from one terminal of the battery to the other and that is all that is required to have a parallel circuit. These two current paths are said to be in parallel with each other even if the wires that conduct the two current paths are at times perpendicular to each other.|`|X8LNbaKQaa	Parallel circuit  means that two or more current paths connect across the same two nodes (points where things connect together).  So the current through each of those paths is independent of the others, and all of those paths share a common voltage (the voltage difference between those two common nodes.  Plugging several appliances into a power strip is an example of loads connected in parallel, the power strip must supply the sum of all their individual currents, while appliances all see the same power line voltage.<br>  <br>  Series connected components are strung together, end to end, so that the same current must pass through each of those components.  The voltage at the two ends of this string must make up the sum of each of the voltages across each of those components.  The tiny Christmas lamp strings operate on this principle.  For instance , each lamp might need 6 volts across it to operate and pass a tenth of a an ampere of current through it.  Connect 20 of those lamps in series, and 120 volts of line voltage will divide up into 20 different 6 volt drops, one of those drops across each lamp.  The current at the plug is the same tenth of an amp that passes through all of the lamps at the same time.  Pull out one lamp, and the entire 120 line volts will be dropped across the empty socket, leaving none for each of the other lamps and the string current will fall to zero.  The other 19 lamps go out.<br>  <br>  -- <br>  Regards,<br>  <br>  John Popelish|`|buLqy1b3aa	This link has all the pictures (and explanation) you need.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_and_parallel_circuits" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_and_...</a><br>  <br>  In the case of a parallel circuit, the start points of each resistor are connected, and the end points of each resistor are connected.  This way current can divide between each resistor.  It's like you have two alternate paths to your destination.<br>  <br>  In the case of the series circuit, the end point of one resistor is connected to the start point of the next resistor.  In this case all the current must go through both resistors.  It's a bit like traffic jam.<br>  <br>  I don't know if you wanted series and parallel resistors, specifically, because you hook them up the same way for any other type of element.  You can have series and parallel resistors, capacitors, inductors, or voltage sources.  Usually they start out teaching you about resistors though.|`|sLWeIrY9aa	I'm assuming you're talking about a linear circuit. I believe the answer you are looking for is something like. When something is hooked up in series it usually is referring to a two terminal device(has two places to connect wires like resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, and power sources) these two terminal devices are hooked end to end in a line. If circuit elements are hooked up in parallel, that means all the element are connected to the same two wires.<br>  <br>  There are pictures in the link below illustrating this. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_circuit" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_ci...</a>|`|a40weoqtaa	a series circuit is simply 'one after the other' (like in a row), whereas the parallel circuit is branched.<br>  <br>  Series example:<br>  ------------resistor--------resistor--...<br>  <br>  Parallel example:<br>   __|---------resistor----------|_____<br>  ....|---------resistor----------|<br>  (note: ignore the dots, the ends of these wires are connected)

9Wi2eNInaa	Well the jobs I've had as a mechanical engineer, vary quite a bit depending on the company. Like one company I worked for made power plant boilers, turbines and condensers. So you could be on all kinds of projects. Like one I had was to streamline the production jigs so they could assemble parts together and weld them faster. So I had to look at the jigs they were using and see where the inefficiencies were and try to figure out a faster (and cheaper...all companies REALLY care about that)<br>  way of assembling the parts.<br>  Another task was to see if we could use cheaper alloys that were weldable to make boiler tubes with.<br>  <br>  So I guess most engineering tasks I've seen are they want you to study a process in existence and come up with ways to make it faster and cheaper and less waste and manpower.<br>  <br>  Some engineers work on totally new processes. I worked in a plant that made batteries. Well lithium- ion was becoming a big thing, so the chemists would make up a good reaction and basically turn it over to us and it was our responsibility to figure out how to make a production line to make this science project into a commercial success or not. A lot of projects we worked on here were failures, we figured out it would not be profitable to make such and such batteries.

AYlITDg9aa	Find the slope of the line first. Since it is perpendicular to the line y = 2x + 4, that means its slope is -1/2.

So to find the perpendicular slope take the neg reciprocal or -1/2.  Using this new slope and the point given plug the values into the point-slope equation y-y1 = m(x-x1) and simplify where x1 and y1 are the coordinates of the point.<br>  <br>  y-(-2) = -1/2(x-3)|`|UyT8nTxEaa	perpendicular means the slope is the opposite reciprocal of the one you have. Your slope is 2 and you can know it by the equation y=mx+b, in which m is your slope. So a prependicular graph will have a slope m of -1/2. Now you can use another equation to find the new graph. y-y1=m(x-x1). y1 is simply your y on the point given and your x1 is your x on the point given. (3, -2), 3=x1 and -2=y1, your slope=-1/2. Now you can find the equation. y-(-2)=-1/2(x-3). solve for y. y+2=-1/2x+3/2. the equation is therefore y=-1/2x-1/2

Example.  a tablespoon of salt is about 58 g of table salt = about 1 mole of salt.   it's much easier to conduct reactions in the lab in terms of 1 mole or 2 moles or 10 moles rather than 602,200,000,000,000,000,000,000 formula units or 1,204,400,000,000,000,000,000,000 units or 6,022,000,000,000,000,000,000,000... right?<br>  <br>  "moles" is simply for convenience.<br>  <br>  *********atomic mass and molecular / formula mass *********<br>  <br>  listed on a periodic table like this one.. <br>  <a href="http://www.chemicalelements.com/show/mass.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.chemicalelements.com/show/mas...</a><br>  is the atomic mass of all the elements.  That mass has units of "amu's"  (Atomic Mass Units) per atom.<br>  <br>  The mass of a molecule (or formula unit in the case of say salts) = sum of the masses of all the atoms.  so if we have several of the same atoms, we can just multiply the number of those atoms x the atomic mass of those atoms.   Example  C6H6.  C has atomic mass = 12.  H has atomic mass = 1... so C6H6 has molecular mass = 6x12 + 6x1 = 78.   Again, units are amu/atom or amu/molecule...<br>  <br>  So why do we say g/mole?<br>  <br>  well 1 amu = 1.66x10^-24 g...<br>  <br>  so 1 amu / atom x (1.66x10^-24 g / amu) x (6.022x10^23 atoms / mole) = 1 g / mole... because 1.66x10^-24 x 6.022x10^23 = 1..  how about that... <br>  <br>  what that means is this.. and REMEMBER THIS...<br>  <br>  atomic mass on a periodic table can be read in "amu/atom" or in "g/mole"...<br>  <br>  it's actually g/mole of atoms but that is usually not mentioned.<br>  <br>  ****** Factor Label Method *********<br>   can't stress enough how important it is to be able to do unit conversions. The method taught by most teachers and universities today is called "unit factor" or "factor label" or in some circles "dimensional analysis". <br>  <br>  Spend 5 minutes and read this. And then practice this method. It will make problems like this easy. And will give you a great starting point for other problems as you continue your education. ok?<br>  <br>  *************<br>  *************<br>  The process I used is called "unit factor method" aka "factor label method" and sometimes called "dimensional analysis"... it is one of the most important techniques you will learn in chemistry. it allows you to do unit conversions while watching the units cancel. Which prevents many common errors. It also allows you to change compound units easily...like kg m/s2 to lb ft / s2 for example...<br>  <br>  There are 5 rules to learn. Take each of theses rules 1 at a time and read them thoroughly until you understand them. once you do, move on to the next...<br>  <br>  ???? rule 1) units on top and bottom of a fraction cancel.<br>  <br>  examples: <br>  in / in = 1<br>  ft / ft = 1<br>  cm / cm cancels.<br>  sec / sec cancel<br>  sec2 / sec2 cancel<br>  m3 / m3 cancels<br>  <br>  got that down? <br>  <br>  ****<br>  ???? rule 2) any number x 1 = that number<br>  <br>  examples:<br>  4 x 1 = 4<br>  4 in x 1 = 4 in<br>  5280 ft x 1 = 5280 ft<br>  9.8 m / s2 x 1 = 9.8 m / s2<br>  <br>  easy right?<br>  <br>  ****<br>  ???? rule 3) any equality can be rearranged to = 1<br>  <br>  examples:<br>  <br>  2.54 cm = 1 in <br>  if we divide both sides by 2.54 we get<br>  2.54 cm / 2.54 cm = 1 in / 2.54 cm<br>  1 = 1 in / 2.54 cm<br>  <br>  12 in = 1 ft<br>  12 in / 12 in = 1 ft / 12 in<br>  1 = 1 ft / 12 in<br>  <br>  also... since 1/1 = 1....<br>  <br>  1 / 1 = 1 / (1 ft / 12 in)<br>  1 = 12 in / 1 ft<br>  <br>  meaning for any equality of the form a = b, .....a / b = b / a = 1<br>  <br>  a/b and b/a are called unit factors because they = unity and we will be using them in rules 4 and 5 to factor (or more precisely "change" units)<br>  <br>  ok? this may be a bit more complicated than the first two rules but if you play around with it for a while I'm sure you will get it.<br>  <br>  ****<br>  ???? rule 4) units can be changed by multiplying by an appropriate "unit factor".<br>  <br>  this essentially combines rules 1, 2, and 3<br>  <br>  example....<br>  <br>  10 in = ? cm<br>  <br>  10 in x 1 = 10 in right?<br>  and 2.54 cm / 1 in = 1 right?<br>  substituting<br>  <br>  10 in x (2.54 cm / 1 in ) =|`|of2sIYtPaa	I like Sodium Chloride too.<br>  <br>  I'm 13 and don't know enough chemistry to answer that.

dDUTYJWmaa	It depends on what type of work you wish to do in marine biology.  If you want to work in the field, you will mostly likely be on a boat or on the shore, in this situation swimming will be very helpful if not absolutely necessary.  However if you want to work in a laboratory, analyzing data, etc, then swimming will not be necessary.<br>  <br>  As a side note, swimming can be scary at first, but it can be very fun and beneficial.  It's a great form of excercise, and if you do choose to become a marine biologist will allow you more opportunities in the field.   Check out your local YMCA, or community pool for lessons, life guards are normally very friendly and understanding.  GOOD LUCK!!|`|EuiWiIaDaa	Absolutly not!

For instance, if your blood pressure were to unexectedly drop dangerously low for any reason, your veins could collapse and make it very difficult to establish an IV at that time.

tU5NJVL3aa	Looks like you have the answer -- (5, -7) -- are you asking for HOW to solve it?  As suggested, you can multiply each equation by a constant in order to get similar x or y values, then add or subtract one from the other so solve for y or x... like this:<br>  <br>  12(8x + 5y) = 12(5) [multiply both sides by 12]<br>  5(3x + 12y) = 5(-69) [multiply both sides by 5]<br>  <br>  96x + 60y = 60<br>  15x + 60y = -345 <br>  <br>  81x = 405 [subtracted the bottom from the top]<br>  x = 405/81 = 5<br>  <br>  so now that you know the value of x, you can plug that into either of your equations to solve for y... lets use the first one:<br>  8x + 5y = 5<br>  40 + 5y = 5<br>  5y = -35<br>  y = -35/5 = -7<br>  <br>  ... got it?|`|FUw3UPyBaa	Its easier if you simplify 3x+12y=-69 to x+4y=-13, then you muliply by -8<br>  But if you want to multiply BOTH equations, multiply the top one by -3 and the bottom by 8. This allows you to get opposite coefficients for x:<br>  -24x-15y=-15, and 24x+96y=-552. Then use elimination to get rid of the 24x and the -24x. You now have 81y=-567. Divide by 81 to get y=-7. So then you plug in -7 for y every time to get x. 8x+5(-7)=5. You then get 8x-35=5, and then finally x=5. So the answer, as you had, was (5,-7)

tMnzcrCgaa	They are structures that are similar in structure (like the leg of a human and the leg of an alligator or wing of a bat). Because the structures are so similar, it infers that there is a more common ancestor, thus these organisms are more closely related. These structures probably were "naturally selected" for the organism in order to help the organisms in their environments. Organisms that survive will pass down those genes and that my friend is what we call natural selection. :)

cJPOs7Tsaa	Without looking through the eyepiece, aim the telescope at the sun. Hold a grey (white is hard to look at) sheet of paper about a foot in front of the eyepiece. The sun's image will be projected onto the paper.<br>  <br>  This is not a good idea for ALL telescopes! Some types will be cooked if you do this (sorry I don't remeber which).|`|Tiph3lQcaa	There are specific filters that can be used to view the sun safely. These are attached to the front of the scope, so the light is filtered before it enters the telescope. I would not recommend projecting the image onto a piece of paper behind the eyepiece; you will build up a lot of heat inside the scope and probably damage it.<br>  <br>  There are also solar telescopes that are designed specifically for viewing the sun at certain discrete wavelengths. These are quite nice, and they provide fascinating and safe images.|`|17d2136cb28b3dcd96bfa98507022f5eaa	The best way to view the Sun with a telescope is to use a full aperture solar filter in front of the telescope. These filters are designed expressly for solar observing and are available in many sizes. My favourites are the ones made by Jim Kendrick:<br>  <a href="http://www.kendrickastro.com/astro/solarfilters.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kendrickastro.com/astro/solar...</a><br>  <br>  These use the best Baader solar filter material, and are well made from aluminum with nylon thumbscrews to lock the filter in place. Filters are also made by Orion and Thousand Oaks. These filters are preferable to the older projection method, which can build up enormous heat inside the telescope and cause serious damage.<br>  <br>  At present we are still at a minimum of solar activity, so you probably won't see any sunspots, just granulation of the surface.<br>  <br>  I also have a Coronado PST (Personal Solar Telescope) which lets me view the Sun in hydrogen-alpha light. This brings out the prominences on the limb and flares on the Sun itself. These can change in minutes so provide an dynamic view of solar activity.|`|Sv6pzP36aa	u need a special filter I think, well, not rlly. Heard its intensity can be blocked from any type of filter.

k6LaxY2Jaa	well, im taking your question as a way to run a car from hydrogen and oxygen.  on that basis i would say the heat from the combination of H2 and O2 is basically negligible and cannot solely be used in an ICE (internal combustion engine) and if you wanted to you would have to combust it, that makes sense now doesn't it.  per unit weight hydrogen is 3X more powerful than gasoline but H2 is so much less dense its hard to carry enough fuel without burdening the vehicle using it.  another note is that ICE's lost alot of their efficiency from heat making even todays engines about 23% efficient.<br>  <br>  the solution is a fuel cell which is what i think what you are talking about in the first place.  it uses the energy released from the 2H2+02=2H2O reaction and turns it into electrical energy that's usable from the cell itself.  for a full size car the issue is a fuel cell big enough and powerful enough is almost prohibitively expensive.  you run the fuel cell power to batteries then to electric motors (can be upwards of 90% efficient).  oh yeah, the only pollution generated is pure water.  <br>  <br>  -storing energy/H2<br>  storing hydrogen in compressed form is dangerous and can lead to explosions is a rupture occurs.<br>  solution is to store the H2 in a solid state Crystalline lattice that does not explode if the tank is ruptured.  the only thing is that even a small tank is expensive.  deriving H2 can be done via windmills or PV (photovoltaic) panels on the low/no fossil fuel usage<br>  <br>  any further info you can email me, good luck<br>  <br>  -Andrew|`|Up9IRlAzaa	First I'd suggest you proofread and spell check you question so we can understand what you're trying to do.<br>  <br>  Your last sentence is more or less accurate, but that single electron means it is a very reactive element.  When it reacts with another element that is short of electrons in it's outer shell (such as oxygen) the reaction releases heat which can be used to power an internal combustion engine.<br>  <br>  The application of direct current to a water solution adds energy to the water molecule which leads to the separation of the hydrogen and the oxygen atoms which can then be allowed to recombine and release the energy as heat.

XjrN3TSgaa	We know that Newton's Second Law (with no changing mass over time) is:<br>  F=ma<br>  Since acceleration is a vector quantity, it will give us a direction with its speed.  So if we make one of the directions positive (let's say west), we can add the forces together, divide by the mass, then see the direction of acceleration.<br>  <br>  You try!  My answer is below.<br>  (4250N (W) - 770N (E) - 1200N (E))/6800kg = 2280N/6800kg = .335 m/s/s<br>  The acceleration is positive, so the boat is moving west at .335 m/s/s.

Together with one of the massive star clusters is an intermediate mass black hole weighing 1,300 solar masses orbiting close to the monster size black hole. Around it are more stars, less massive should we say. They orbit pretty chaotically around the black hole. The nearest star orbiting the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A* is S2.

The better your graduate adviser, the more likely you will get a good opportunity in research in the future.  That is how it matter.  Your graduate GPA does not matter.  Your PhD topic and adviser and your publication list are much more important than your graduate GPA.  But to get into a top grad program, you need a good undergrad GPA or need to come from a good undergrad school, or both.  So I would say your BS GPA is fairly important for you.  At the next level, your grad GPA will be almost irrelevant for future jobs.
AA10655250	If you think geography is all about staring at maps and memorizing state capitols, you couldn’t be more wrong. As a geography major, you’ll study a wide variety of subjects: deserts in the making, the causes of racially segregated housing, the paths of tornados, and the way international trade agreements affect business in a small town.<br>  <br>  Many geography professors started their academic careers in some other discipline! Geography is both a social science and a natural science, with a bit of the arts thrown in! The focus of geography is on spatial relationships - whether the topic is languages, landforms, or lichens. <br>  <br>  Geography is a fascinating intellectual pursuit, a key to good citizenship, and a solid basis for a variety of interesting careers. Training in geography provides a mix of technical and analytical skills that are very much in demand in the modern economy. The ability to integrate information and to analyze problems in a broad context makes geographers valuable team members in many work settings.<br>  <br>  Another option is with a concentration in meteorology and a minor or second major in journalism you could become a television weathercaster.<br>  <br>  See the links below for additional information.

Ftkr9jqYaa	The best of these alternatives is:<br>  <br>  c)are rescued by application of hormone Y<br>  <br>  Reason.  If you need to trace the pathway by which hormone Y signals are transduced and effectuated, then you need a plant that actively utilizes hormone Y.  Thus, options a) and b) are wrong.  Consequently, d) and e) are also incorrect.  Any plant that is "rescued" by hormone Y will definitely reveal its biophysiological operational processes.
Ftkr9jqYaa	The best of these alternatives is:<br>  <br>  b)No, a receptor for compound X must be identified.<br>  <br>  Reason:  A second messenger is not required for a compound to be a hormone, so d) is wrong.  Although hormones are almost always synthesized, they need not always be present during all stages of the life cycle at physiologically active concentrations, so e) is incorrect.  Since hormones are not defined as functioning only at nanomolecular levels, c) is not correct.  Finally, there are many possible explanations for the dwarfism aside from a hormonal phenomenon, such as the stunting of growth caused by a toxic chemical, so a) is also wrong.  On the other hand, b) is a good answer, since all cells respond to a hormone via the expression of a specific receptor for that hormone. The hormone binds to the receptor protein, resulting in the activation of a signal transduction mechanism that ultimately leads to cell type-specific responses.
vhpOCRAQaa	There's a huge very complex equasion that explains it.|`|Gmvldblraa	I think you are confusing force with energy. Newton was the person who recognised that an object would continue in motion forever if no outside force operated on it. Its not obvious and it goes against all our experience, but it happens to be true.<br>  Likewise, an object can sit on a shelf, happily defying gravity, forever. No energy needed.<br>  The forces on the object are balanced, they don't move....no work is done and the object doesn't change position.<br>  <br>  Your magnet, which I take it is supporting some other magnet in the air above it, is itself held by something that is in contact with the ground, so all the magnetic force is doing is transferring the normal force of reaction to whatever is it is holding  up. No energy needed.<br>  <br>  Have to go out - I hate long discussion questions when there can be no proper dialogue. Good luck - its not as tough as it seems.|`|WiwUDViuaa	well i dont know the maths u did.. but did u take into account the resistance (the air resistance). <br>  Assuming ideal conditions (no resistance), its impossible for an object to get accelerated for one year throughout at the gravitational force = 9.8m/s/s as it is only at surface of earth that too at equator and sea level . As we go far away from surface, the force decreases as a function of (1/r^2) where r is the distance. So its not possible to get accelerated for an year @ g. <br>  <br>  i did not get ur question regarding permanent magnet! u are tellin that magnetic force is resisting gravitation force?|`|uVQ6OSu3aa	Energy can be found in many things and takes many forms. There is potential energy in objects at rest that will make them move if resistance is removed. There is kinetic energy in objects that are moving. The molecules making up all matter contains a huge amount of energy, as Einstein's E = mc^2 pointed out to us. Energy can also travel in the form of electromagnetic waves, such as heat, light, radio, and gamma rays. Your body is using metabolic energy from your last meal as you read this. Energy is constantly flowing and changing form. If you take your metabolic energy and rub your hands together, you have made metabolic energy into mechanical energy. Your hands will heat up. That is some of the mechanical energy turning into heat energy. <br>  <br>  So energy can change form, but where did that energy ultimately come from? Let's trace back a chain of events. A bicycle is rolling down the hill, transferring potential energy into kinetic (movement) energy. The bicycle got its potential energy (energy due to position related to gravity) by the rider using metabolic energy to move the pedals. The pedals used mechanical energy to move the chain, which moved the wheels. The rider's metabolic energy came from chemical energy that was stored in the molecules of the food she ate. That chemical energy entered the animal whose meat she ate by the animal digesting a plant and breaking the bonds in its molecules. The plant made the molecules by using light energy from the Sun. The Sun's light energy came from electrons in its atoms lowering energy states, and releasing energy. The energy in the atoms came from the nuclear reactions in the heart of the Sun. What started the nuclear reactions? Physicists think the Big Bang did.|`|KRTPJP2baa	Answers above explain the physics. Also gravity is by far the weakest of all the fundamental forces.

AA11432707	There is a trend away from pre-medication for adults, and we usually only give it if a patient is really nervous and upset.  Those drugs are given IV and work in about a minute.<br>  <br>  For kids, it's a totally different matter.  Oral pre-medication takes 10-15 minutes to have a decent effect.  If you give it too close to going back for surgery, it won't be working yet, and you've exposed a kid to the risks of a drug for little to no benefit.<br>  <br>  If you give it too early, it can start to wear off.

J7h0C66Baa	To kill most problem insects indoors mix 1/4 alcohol and 3/4 water add a drop or two of Liquid dish soap.  Get manual spray bottle, Dollar store has them for about a dollar.  Spray the bugs off with this solution. It will take care of your flying insects, probably white flies. Aphids will succumb to it also.  I don't know what you have in your pots. I have no idea what insects are in your area.  But, the above mixture will probably do a number on them also. The solution will become more penetrating with the soap and get into their breathing tubes and suffocate them all.  The White flies will try to fly away and return later.  A yellow paper set in a saucer and covered with cooking oil will attract and kill them.   Spray your plant with the solution in a week if needed.  I've been having pretty good luck with cooking oil applied in the hiding places on the plant.  It kills the eggs and baby bugs you may have missed.  The adult can just be sprayed off when noticed.  If you have gnats, take a two liter bottle and cut off the neck just where it becomes the same diameter as the bottom part.  Turn the neck around and insert the drinking part in the bottom.  Use some tape to seal where the two parts join so the bugs can't escape. Put some fruit juice, pieces of fruit etc in the bottle.  The bugs will go in and can't find their way out even with the open cap.   Ever so often take the bottle and lay it in the freezer. the critters will die.  You can use it several time.  Then just make a new one. Throw the old used one out.   No need  for harsh chemicals and it works quite well.  Left alone on your plant, the insects will suck out the sap and kill the plant. The first thing you may notice is the end of the leaves turning brown.  Later they will droop and fall off.<br>  Look up gnats, Aphids, scale and maybe silver fish or earwigs? This may be what you have.  With out seeing them I can only quess.  But what ever they are this is a safe way to get rid of them.|`|ZahjlUioaa	Yes. I know what you are talking about. they are called dark-winged gnats. the larvae lives off of the plant roots. They usually come with the bad soil mix. The best way to get rid of them is by getting rid of the soil off of the root and washing the pot and roots (all roots), and not to use that potting soil again. its contaminated. another thing is when you get the potting soil, check for moisture. a lot of times the potting mixtures can become very moist which causes fungus and insects like moist soils. I have tried many types of organic soil insecticides and none of them worked. <br>  Remember when washing the roots, be gentle with them. Root hairs are very sensitive to touch. Get in-between the roots and get rid of all debris and dead roots (the eggs will might be there). dry gently like patting them down.

CUqXYNHvaa	It's boom time for mobile phones in India. And people are looking forward to more information, faster data access and multimedia services through their mobile phones. 3G technology is here to turn this dream into reality. It's a technology anxiously awaited by telecom operations and subscribers in India.<br>  <br>  Not very long! India is all set to launch 3G mobile telephone services by June 2007.<br>  <br>  According to Telecom Regulatory Authority of India chairman Nripendra Misra, a total of 32.5 MHz is available for allocation within the next 6-9 months.<br>  <br>  Trai has also recommended auctioning 200 MHz for broadband wireless access services like Wimax (worldwide interoperability for microwave access) and has proposed a national frequency management board to oversee spectrum availability and its efficient use.<br>  <br>  He hopes that the allocated spectrum would be enough for the next two years and said Trai would recommend freeing up more spectrum for those who lose out in this auction. <br>  <br>  So what is 3G spectrum all about? Read on.<br>  <br>  What is spectrum?<br>  <br>  Radio spectrum refers to a range of radio frequencies. The bandwidth of a radio signal is the difference between the upper and lower frequencies of the signal.<br>  <br>  For example, in the case of a voice signal having a minimum frequency of 200 hertz (Hz) and a maximum frequency of 3,000 Hz, the bandwidth is 2,800 Hz (3 KHz). The amount of bandwidth needed for 3G services could be as much as 15-20 Mhz, whereas for 2G services a bandwidth of 30-200 KHz is used. Hence, for 3G huge bandwidth is required. <br>  <br>  How is 3G different from 2G and 4G?<br>  <br>  While 2G stands for second-generation wireless telephone technology, 1G networks used are analog, 2G networks are digital and 3G (third-generation) technology is used to enhance mobile phone standards.<br>  <br>  3G helps to simultaneously transfer both voice data (a telephone call) and non-voice data (such as downloading information, exchanging e-mail, and instant messaging. The highlight of 3G is video telephony. 4G technology stands to be the future standard of wireless devices.<br>  <br>  Currently, Japanese company NTT DoCoMo and Samsung are testing 4G communication. <br>  <br>  How will 3G services help you?<br>  <br>  3G services will enable video broadcast and data-intensive services such as stock transactions, e-learning and telemedicine through wireless communications<br>  <br>  All telecom operators are waiting to launch 3G in India to cash in on revenues by providing high-end services to customers, which are voice data and video enabled. India lags behind many Asian countries in introducing 3G services.<br>  <br>  What is Trai's recommendation on 3G pricing? <br>  <br>  The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India has recommended auctioning radio frequencies for 3G telecom services at a reserve price of Rs 1,050 crore (Rs 10.50 billion) to companies seeking to offer nationwide high-speed Internet and streaming video. <br>  <br>  The base price for spectrum in cities like Mumbai and Delhi and Category A telecom circles is Rs 80 crore (Rs 800 million); in cities like Chennai and Kolkata and Category B circles Rs 40 crore (Rs 400 million); and in all other cities Rs 15 crore (Rs 150 million).<br>  <br>  What are the frequency bands and quota for CDMA?<br>  <br>  Trai has recommended three sets of frequency bands - 450 mhz, 800 mhz and 2.1 ghz. For CDMA players like Reliance [Get Quote] and Tata Teleservices [Get Quote] 1.25 MHz each is offered. CDMA operators are free to bid both in the 2.1 GHz and the 450 MHz bands, but they will be allocated spectrum only in one. The pricing of these two bands is linked to the auction in the 2.1 GHz band. <br>  <br>  CDMA operators will pay the same as the second-highest GSM bidder. And if there is more than one claimant in the 450 MHz band, the reserve price will be half of that arrived at in the 2.1 GHz band. Another rider is that if the highest bid is a quarter more than the lowest, the lowest bidder has to raise its bid to 75 per cent of the winning bid. <br>  <br>  But CDMA operators are likely to face problems. Operating 3G services on 450 MHz is a problem because we they do not have dual-band phones that work both in 450 MHz and in 800 MHz (the band in which CDMA operates in India).<br>  <br>  What are the issues regarding 3G for providers and users?<br>  <br>  3G has successfully been introduced in Europe. But several issues continue to hamper its growth. <br>  <br>  High spectrum licensing fees for the 3G services<br>  <br>  Huge capital required to build infrastructure for 3G services.<br>  <br>  Health impact of electromagnetic waves.<br>  <br>  Prices are very high for 3G mobile services.<br>  <br>  Will 2G users switch to 3G services.<br>  <br>  Takes time to catch up as the service is new.<br>  <br>  What are the issues regarding 3G pricing?<br>  <br>  Pricing has been a cause of concern. Spectrum auctions ran into billions of euros in Europe. In Europe, spectrum licensing fees were collected years before the 3G service was developed and it required huge investments to build 3G networks, hitting mobile operators' margins.<br>  <br>  However, in Japan and South Kore

This is exactly why gold is used in hundreds of ways in every space vehicle that NASA launches. <br>  <br>  Gold is used in circuitry because it is a dependable conductor and connector. In addition, many parts of every space vehicle are fitted with gold-coated polyester film. This film reflects infrared radiation and helps stabilize the temperature of the spacecraft. Without this coating, dark colored parts of the spacecraft would absorb significant amounts of heat<br>  <br>  Gold is also used as a lubricant between mechanical parts. In the vacuum of space, organic lubricants would volatilize and they would be broken down by the intense radiation beyond Earth's atmosphere. Gold has a very low shear strength and thin films of gold between critical moving parts serves as a lubricant - the gold molecules slip past one another under the forces of friction and that provides a lubricant action<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://dayton.hq.nasa.gov/IMAGES/SMALL/GPN-2000-001181.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://dayton.hq.nasa.gov/IMAGES/SMALL/G...</a><br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  A thin layer of gold covered the visor on the helmet of an astronaut on the moon.

Simply put, we do not know the first thing about what a true cloned human being would be like.  That is the very reason that we should be pursuing and developing human cloning methods and techniques.  It is likely that cloned human beings would tell us a great deal about our biological nature and that of consciousness itself.

TO KNOW IT<br>  <br>  A planet, as defined by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), is a celestial body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity, is not massive enough to cause thermonuclear fusion, and has cleared its neighbouring region of planetesimals.[a][1][2]<br>  <br>  The term planet is ancient, with ties to history, science, myth, and religion. The planets were originally seen by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of the gods. Even today, many people believe in astrology, which holds that the movement of the planets affects people's lives, although such a causation is rejected by the scientific community. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. Even now there is no uncontested definition of what a planet is. In 2006, the IAU officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition has been both praised and criticized, and remains disputed by some scientists.<br>  <br>  The planets were thought by Ptolemy to orbit the Earth in deferent and epicycle motions. Though the idea that the planets orbited the Sun had been suggested many times, it was not until the 17th century that this view was supported by evidence from the first telescopic astronomical observations, performed by Galileo Galilei. By careful analysis of the observation data, Johannes Kepler found the planets' orbits to be not circular, but elliptical. As observational tools improved, astronomers saw that, like Earth, the planets rotated around tilted axes, and some share such features as ice-caps and seasons. Since the dawn of the Space Age, close observation by probes has found that Earth and the other planets share characteristics such as volcanism, hurricanes, tectonics, and even hydrology. Since 1992, through the discovery of hundreds of extrasolar planets (planets around other stars), scientists are beginning to understand that planets throughout the Milky Way Galaxy share characteristics in common with our own.<br>  <br>  Planets are generally divided into two main types: large, low-density gas giants, and smaller, rocky terrestrials. Under IAU definitions, there are eight planets in the Solar System. In order from the Sun, they are the four terrestrials, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, then the four gas giants, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Many of these planets are orbited by one or more moons, which can be larger than small planets. As of February 2009, there are 337 known extrasolar planets, ranging from the size of gas giants to that of terrestrial planets.[3] This brings the total number of identified planets to at least 345. The Solar System also contains at least five dwarf planets: Ceres, Pluto (formerly considered to be the Solar System's ninth planet), Makemake, Haumea and Eris. No extrasolar dwarf planets have yet been detected.|`|OBq36Nynaa	Because elements come in three forms, gases, liquids or solids.

QKO4f5q0aa	I say "some stupid belief".<br>  <br>  Here's why:<br>  <br>  Planet X and Nibiru are two different concepts invented by two different people for two different reasons. <br>  <br>  Nibiru is the brainchild of Zecharia Sitchin, who claimed to have translated ancient Sumerian texts, and that those texts told the story of the Sumerian Gods who inhabited a large planet called Nibiru.  According to Sitchin this planet is in a highly elliptical orbit which brings it close to Earth every 3600 years.  <br>  <br>  Unfortunately for Sitchin other linguists have also studied the Sumerian texts and they dispute his 'translation'.  In fact, the academics say he's pretty much wrong on every point.   Their understanding of the texts leads them to think that 'Nibiru' was the Sumerian word for the planet Jupiter.<br>  <br>  Planet X is the brainchild of Nancy Leider, who claims to be in telepathic contact with the inhabitants of Planet X.  (something about how they abducted her and implanted a receiver in her head).  At various times she has claimed that Planet X was a comet, a gas giant, and a brown dwarf star.   Her first prediction about Planet X was that it would hit us in 2003 or 2004.  When that passed she moved the goalpoasts to 2012.  <br>  <br>  Both of these people are what I consider 'crackpots'.  Their ideas have no scientific merit, are not supported by any evidence whatsoever, and are disputed by various experts in related fields.  Yet they continue to make their claims, and sell their books.  <br>  <br>  Add to all of this that none of their original predictions had anything to do with the current 2012 craze.  Sitchin I am told originally predicted Nibiru would arrive much later in the century; 2070 or 2080.  Leider, as I said above, originally claimed 2003 as the doomsday. <br>  <br>  So yeah, 'some stupid belief'.|`|W2suykEtaa	if the Sumerians actually knew the planets went around the Sun, then why did they have the number of the planets wrong?<br>  <br>  not to mention, Saturn didn't have rings.<br>  <br>  come on!  isn't that proof?<br>  <br>  nibiru is a crackpipe dream.|`|PwfS4T74aa	Nibiru is the orgasmic invention of some stoner, and this mysterious Planet X would have been found by now.

YuWLcExJaa	Dehydration is not limited only to the summer months, although it's probably more likely to occur during that time. Many physicians believe that most people are in a constant state of dehydration. Since coffee, tea, soda and alcohol act as a diuretic, anyone who drinks these fluids on a daily basis, and doesn't drink at least an equal amount of water, will probably be dehydrated. If the person is physically active, the potential for dehydration is even greater.<br>  <br>  Working out in hot, humid conditions promotes sweating, which in turn can cause dehydration. Sweating is good for you because it cools your body, but when you lose too much water you become dehydrated. If you're already slightly dehydrated, sweating will only make it worse. It's important to maintain an adequate fluid intake all the time. Don't expect that you can make up for several days of not drinking enough by downing two cups of sports drink before your next long run or race. It's important to keep hydrated all the time. Once you start to feel thirsty, it's too late.<br>  <br>  The average (sedentary) person needs a minimum of eight 8-ounce glasses of fluid a day. Runners need more: anywhere from four to eight quarts of fluid. That translates to at least sixteen 8-ounce glasses daily. Remember that diuretics don't count! Drink water and sports drinks, and if you don't have to worry about calories, fruit drinks or juice.<br>  <br>  Two hours before your daily summer workout or a race, you should drink 16 ounces of fluid. Then ten minutes or so before you start to run, drink another one or two cups of water or sports drink. Drinking early and drinking often is the key. During a race you should drink six to twelve ounces of fluid every 15-20 minutes. If the weather is very hot, you may need to drink even more. Training in warm weather, you should drink at least every 35 to 40 minutes. (Remember you will have already had two 8-ounce glasses before you started.) If you're running a race shorter than 30 minutes, you probably won't need any water other than what you drank before the start. The same goes for the last few miles of a longer race. If you're racing or training for longer than an hour, drink sports drinks as opposed to strictly water.<br>  <br>  Start drinking immediately after finishing a run, no matter if it was a race or a workout. Minimum is 16 ounces for every 30 minutes you ran. If you tend to sweat a lot, you'll need more. Weigh yourself after you've run. Drink at least 16 ounces of fluid for every pound you lose through sweating.<br>  <br>  By monitoring the color of your urine you can tell if you're hydrated. It should be pale yellow or even clear. If it isn't, you need to drink more fluids. It's important that you retain the fluid, so be careful it you're urinating every fifteen or twenty minutes. To restore your fluid balance, eat something salty (a bag of pretzels, salted nuts, crackers or potato chips), then drink a sports drink. The salt will make you thirstier, so you'll take in even more fluid and urine production will decrease.

A positively charged ion is produced when an electron bonded to an atom (or molecule) absorbs enough energy to escape from the electric potential barrier that originally confined it, thus breaking the bond and freeing it to move. The amount of energy required is called the ionization potential. A negatively charged ion is produced when a free electron collides with an atom and is subsequently caught inside the electric potential barrier, releasing any excess energy.

6Gm7TFQ4aa	There were cases in the past where people would find chairs that were completely charred beyond recognition with nothing remaining of the person who occupied it but a pair of unscathed feet still in slippers. The ceiling would be charred, but everything else would be untouched. <br>  <br>  For a long time, people thought this phenomenon could only be explained by a person suddenly exploding into flames and burning so intensely that the body would be reduced to ashes. <br>  <br>  What it actually turned out to be is something they call the "Wick Effect". When a person holding a cigarette suffers a heart attack or other life threatening event and dies, the cigarette has a chance of igniting the body. The corpse will enter a slow burn, using the fat in the body to intensify the flames. The person literally burns like a candle until there is nothing left. <br>  <br>  So, there is no such thing as spontaneous combustion.

I would imagine it was sometime between 1900-1914, but that's just my guess.<br>  <br>  Evolutionary theories began to gain more acceptance in the late 1800s, after Charles Darwin published "On the Origin of Species"... Then there were a lot of evolutionary biologists after that. The Scopes Trial was in 1925, so students in Tennessee were definitely being taught about evolution in 1925, but possibly earlier. <br>  <br>  The textbook used by John Scopes in his biology class, "Civic Biology" was written by George William Hunter and published in 1914. "Civic Biology" did include a chapter about evolution. <br>  <br>  It's possible that some American public schools introduced the theory of evolution prior to the publication of that textbook.<br>  <br>  But anyway, check out the sources below for more information.|`|wChBdTjRaa	I don't think there was a single year when it started being taught all at once.

Também pode representar a vida e o sangue. <br>  Na sabedoria popular, o laranja, a cor do sol ao amanhecer, representa saúde e grandes emo??es. <br>  O roxo simboliza a tristeza e a ira. O amarelo representa a vida e traz o colorido da energia e da alegria. A vida também é simbolizada pelo verde. Mas com um novo sentido: o destino se renova a cada passo que você dá. <br>  O costume popular classifica o preto como a cor das coisas negativas.

Químico sueco.<br>  <br>  Estudou na Cathedral School de Upsala, quando sua família se transferiu para esta cidade proveniente de Vik, ingressando na Universidade da mesma cidade quando contava com 17 anos de idade. Posteriormente estudou na Universidade de Estocolmo. Ensinou classes de física na Escola Técnica Superior desta Universidade ( 1891-1895 ), alcan?ando o grau de catedrático na mesma ( 1895-1904 ). Em 1904 passou a dirigir o Instituto Nobel de Química e Física ( 1905-1927 ).<br>  <br>  Sendo estudante, preparando-se para o doutorado na Universidade de Upsala, investigou as propriedades condutoras das dissolu??es eletrolíticas, que formulou em sua tese doutoral.. Sua teoria afirma que nas dissolu??es eletrolíticas, os compostos químicos dissolvidos, se dissociam em íons, mantendo a hipótese de que o grau de dissocia??o aumenta com o grau de dilui??o da solu??o, que resultou ser correta apenas para os eletrólitos fracos. Acreditando que a teoria estava errada, sua tese foi aprovada com a qualifica??o mínima possível. Esta teoria foi objeto de muitos ataques, especialmente por Lord Kelvin, sendo apoiada por Jacobus Van't Hoff, em cujo laboratório havia trabalhado como bolsista estrangeiro ( 1886-1890 ), e por Wilhelm Ostwald.<br>  <br>  Posteriormente esta teoria foi aceita por todos, convertendo-se num dos pilares da físico-química , no ramo da eletroquímica. Sua concep??o científica lhe valeu a obten??o do Prêmio Nobel de Química em 1903, "em reconhecimento dos extraordinários servi?os prestados ao avan?o da química através de sua teoria da dissocia??o eletrolítica”.<br>  <br>  Além disso, trabalhou em diversos ramos da físico-química, como velocidade das rea??es, sobre a prática da imuniza??o e sobre astronomia. Como consequência, em 1889, descobriu que a velocidade das rea??es químicas aumenta com a temperatura, numa rela??o proporcional com a concentra??o de moléculas existentes.<br>  <br>  Em 1909 entrou como membro estrangeiro da Royal Society. Em 1911, durante uma visita aos Estados Unidos, foi condecorado com a primeira medalha Willard Gibbs e, em 1914, recebeu a medalha Faraday.|`|0971db84139ccf8f0c4151d3345ea91faa	Svant August Arrhenius nasceu no ano de 1859, na Suécia.

Embora muito poucos tenham tomado a sério suas idéias radicais, o grande cientista alem?o Ostwald ficou t?o entusiasmado que viajou para a Suécia a fim de encontrar-se com Arrhenius. Estimulado por esse apoio, Arrhenius foi estudar na Alemanha e Holanda. Finalmente, em 1889, foi publicado seu trabalho "Sobre a Dissocia??o das Substancias Aquosas". Embora convidado a ir para Leipzig como professor da Universidade preferiu voltar á Suécia como conferencista e professor secundário em Estocolmo. Sua teoria ainda n?o havia conquistado aceita??o geral e os que eram contra apelidavam os seus adeptos de "horda selvagem de Ionianos". Até mesmo o contrato de Arrhenius como professor em Estocolmo, em 1893, foi questionado até que um tempestade de protestos chegou àquela cidade, de parte dos cientistas alem?es. Dois anos após esta nomea??o foi eleito Presidente da Universidade e recebeu o prêmio Nobel, tendo sido o terceiro a recebê-lo no campo da Química. Finalmente, era Arrhenius reconhecido como um grande cientista, como há muito o merecia. Foi-lhe oferecida a ambicionada posi??o de professor de Química na Universidade de Berlim, mas tendo o rei da Suécia fundado o Instituto Nobel de Físico-Química, em 1905 Arrhenius tornou-se seu diretor. Continuou sendo um pesquisador incansável e um cientista extremamente versátil até sua morte, em 1927. O sucesso de Arrhenius em ciência deve ser creditado n?o apenas ao seu brilho como cientista mas também à convic??o com que sustentava seus pontos de vista.

Embora muito poucos tenham tomado a sério suas idéias radicais, o grande cientista alem?o Ostwald ficou t?o entusiasmado que viajou para a Suécia a fim de encontrar-se com Arrhenius. Estimulado por esse apoio, Arrhenius foi estudar na Alemanha e Holanda. Finalmente, em 1889, foi publicado seu trabalho "Sobre a Dissocia??o das Substancias Aquosas". Embora convidado a ir para Leipzig como professor da Universidade preferiu voltar á Suécia como conferencista e professor secundário em Estocolmo. Sua teoria ainda n?o havia conquistado aceita??o geral e os que eram contra apelidavam os seus adeptos de "horda selvagem de Ionianos". Até mesmo o contrato de Arrhenius como professor em Estocolmo, em 1893, foi questionado até que um tempestade de protestos chegou àquela cidade, de parte dos cientistas alem?es. Dois anos após esta nomea??o foi eleito Presidente da Universidade e recebeu o prêmio Nobel, tendo sido o terceiro a recebê-lo no campo da Química. Finalmente, era Arrhenius reconhecido como um grande cientista, como há muito o merecia. Foi-lhe oferecida a ambicionada posi??o de professor de Química na Universidade de Berlim, mas tendo o rei da Suécia fundado o Instituto Nobel de Físico-Química, em 1905 Arrhenius tornou-se seu diretor. Continuou sendo um pesquisador incansável e um cientista extremamente versátil até sua morte, em 1927. O sucesso de Arrhenius em ciência deve ser creditado n?o apenas ao seu brilho como cientista mas também à convic??o com que sustentava seus pontos de vista. Suas concep??es sobre as propriedades elétricas das solu??es aquosas eram t?o avan?adas em rela??o ao pensamento da época que teriam sido ignoradas, n?o fosse confiar ele na utilidade de sua teoria e em recusar abandoná-las. O fato do modelo i?nico das solu??es aquosas mudar de maneira efetiva a química inorganica á um tributo justo ao méritos de Arrhenius.|`|c4e1820a5c165afdec4bcaf7cbba68efaa	Muitoo bem!!!

Químico sueco.<br>  <br>  Estudou na Cathedral School de Upsala, quando sua família se transferiu para esta cidade proveniente de Vik, ingressando na Universidade da mesma cidade quando contava com 17 anos de idade. Posteriormente estudou na Universidade de Estocolmo. Ensinou classes de física na Escola Técnica Superior desta Universidade ( 1891-1895 ), alcan?ando o grau de catedrático na mesma ( 1895-1904 ). Em 1904 passou a dirigir o Instituto Nobel de Química e Física ( 1905-1927 ).<br>  <br>  Sendo estudante, preparando-se para o doutorado na Universidade de Upsala, investigou as propriedades condutoras das dissolu??es eletrolíticas, que formulou em sua tese doutoral.. Sua teoria afirma que nas dissolu??es eletrolíticas, os compostos químicos dissolvidos, se dissociam em íons, mantendo a hipótese de que o grau de dissocia??o aumenta com o grau de dilui??o da solu??o, que resultou ser correta apenas para os eletrólitos fracos. Acreditando que a teoria estava errada, sua tese foi aprovada com a qualifica??o mínima possível. Esta teoria foi objeto de muitos ataques, especialmente por Lord Kelvin, sendo apoiada por Jacobus Van't Hoff, em cujo laboratório havia trabalhado como bolsista estrangeiro ( 1886-1890 ), e por Wilhelm Ostwald.<br>  <br>  Posteriormente esta teoria foi aceita por todos, convertendo-se num dos pilares da físico-química , no ramo da eletroquímica. Sua concep??o científica lhe valeu a obten??o do Prêmio Nobel de Química em 1903, "em reconhecimento dos extraordinários servi?os prestados ao avan?o da química através de sua teoria da dissocia??o eletrolítica”.<br>  <br>  Além disso, trabalhou em diversos ramos da físico-química, como velocidade das rea??es, sobre a prática da imuniza??o e sobre astronomia. Como consequência, em 1889, descobriu que a velocidade das rea??es químicas aumenta com a temperatura, numa rela??o proporcional com a concentra??o de moléculas existentes.<br>  <br>  Em 1909 entrou como membro estrangeiro da Royal Society. Em 1911, durante uma visita aos Estados Unidos, foi condecorado com a primeira medalha Willard Gibbs e, em 1914, recebeu a medalha Faraday.

Se han desarrollado por tanto diferentes teorías para explicar su presencia en el latín, que básicamente se pueden dividir en tres grupos:<br>  <br>  Los escritores antiguos optaban por un origen griego de la palabra: esperos era el nombre de la primera estrella que se observaba tras el crepúsculo en el occidente. Los griegos llamaron (H)Esperia a Italia y a Espa?a, ya que se encontraban a su occidente; por una mutación de fonemas es posible que Hesperia pasara a ser Hispania. Otros creían que la palabra procedía de alguna manera del dios Pan.<br>  <br>  Las etimologías más aceptadas actualmente prefieren suponer un origen fenicio de la misma. En 1674, el francés Samuel Bochart, basándose en un texto de Cátulo donde llama a Espa?a "cuniculosa", propuso que ahí podría estar el origen de la palabra "Espa?a". De esa forma, dedujo que en hebreo (lengua semítica, emparentada con el fenicio) la palabra sf(a) n podría significar ?conejo?, ya que el término fenicio I-shphanim literalmente significa: 'de damanes' (shphanim, es la forma plural de shaphán, 'damán', Hyrax syriacus, que fue como los fenicios decidieron denominar al conejo Oryctolagus cuniculus, animal autóctono ibérico desconocido por ellos).<br>  <br>  Si esta etimología es la cierta, se debería a que los fenicios constataron la presencia de una gran población de conejos en la Península Ibérica, a la cual llamaron ?Tierra de conejos?. Otra versión de esta misma etimología sería Hi-shphanim, 'Isla de conejos' (o, de nuevo literalmente, de damanes). Otra posibilidad respecto de la raiz fenicia Span es el significado de oculto (país escondido y remoto), que de hecho, esta asociada al nombre que los fenicios dieron a los conejos ibéricos.<br>  <br>  Otra posibilidad, propuesta por el sevillano Trigueros en 1767 la derivaría del fenicio sp(a)n (norte), como era la península Ibérica con respecto al norte de áfrica, desde donde fenicios y cartagineses llegaban a la misma.<br>  <br>  Finalmente, algunos científicos modernos optan por un origen autóctono de la palabra, unos lo suponen relacionado con el vocablo vasco ezpaina (labio, pero que podría también interpretarse como borde o confín), mientras que otros, como el filólogo Tovar lo relacionan con Hispalis, nombre antiguo de Sevilla y también de origen incierto.<br>  <br>  Con motivo de la operación militar de la isla de Perejil en 2002, se rescató un artículo de Miguel de Unamuno (curiosamente de 1902) en el que exponía lo siguiente:<br>  <br>  El nombre de Espa?a se cree sea semítico por haber conocido los romanos nuestra península merced a los cartagineses, y suele traducirse "isla del Tesoro", aludiendo a las riquezas mineras de nuestro subsuelo, de i, ai, e, isla y la raíz semítica sapan, de donde se deriva sapun o sapin, tesoro. Pero M. Bérard da otra etimología derivándolo de I-spanea, del sustantivo spanea, escondrijo. Y a?ade triunfalmente. "I-spanea no es más que la Isla de Kalypso, la Isla del Escondrijo, Perejil es la que era en un principio Ispania, y no fue sino por error o por una extensión de sentido por lo que este nombre pasó al continente vecino"[[1]]. <br>   <br>  Edad Antigua<br>  Los íberos fueron los primeros pueblos de los que se tiene constancia escrita que ocuparon la Península Ibérica. Se sabe que había poblaciones pre-íberas, por restos arqueológicos. Los griegos y fenicios fueron los que dejaron los primeros escritos, aunque nunca entraron en contacto con ellos. Los vascos o vascones probablemente entran en esta categoría.<br>  <br>  Actualmente, se definen los íberos por sus rasgos culturales. Según este criterio, los turdetanos o túrdulos, que ocuparon las tierras del antiguo reino de Tartessos, se consideran íberos; mientras que, según criterios etnográficos o lingüísticos, no lo serían. La bibliografía sobre los íberos ofrece con frecuencia datos contradictorios y esto se debe a que, a veces, se adopta un criterio y otras, otro.<br>  <br>   <br>  Castro celta del norte de Espa?aSobre el a?o 1200 adC, tribus celtas, incluyendo probablemente cántabros y astures, entraron en la península por el Norte y se establecieron en gran parte de su territorio asentándose y mezclándose con los íberos. Las poblaciones que ocupaban una amplia franja entre estos dos pueblos se conocen como celtíberos. Parece ser que las monta?as en que vivía el pueblo vasco nunca fueron completamente romanizadas, por lo que se considera el origen de esta población incierto, y de seguro muy antiguo, como su lengua, barajándose la posibilidad de que se tratase de una población pre-ibérica.<br>  <br>  Alrededor del a?o 1100 adC los fenicios llegaron a la península y fundaron colonias, la más importante fue Gadir, la Gades romana, que hoy es Cádiz. A su vez los griegos fundaron sus colonias en la costa mediterránea de Iberia, nombre que dieron a la península.<br>  <br>  Entre la primera y segunda de las Guerras Púnicas entre Roma y Cartago, los cartagineses invadieron la península. Sus colonias más importantes las establecieron en la isla de Ibiza y en Cartagena, nombre que debiera hacer referencia a la nueva Cartago. Derrotada Cartago, Roma iniciaría una paulatina ocupación de la península, que se prolongaría a lo largo de casi 200 a?os. En las primeras décadas de la ocupación los romanos tuvieron que hacer frente al largo sitio de Numancia, ciudad celtíbera ubicada en las orillas del Duero, en las proximidades de la actual Soria, que se prolongaría por casi 30 a?os, y a la guerra de guerrillas planteada por el caudillo lusitano Viriato. Tras la muerte de Viriato (139 adC), la lucha de los pueblos prerromanos contra Roma se volvería más disgregada y esporádica, aunque no finalizaría totalmente hasta los tiempos del emperador Augusto con el sometimiento de cántabros y astures. La ocupación culminaría con el pleno dominio de la península bajo el poder romano y su conversión en provincia bajo el nombre de Hispania. El nombre de Hispania deriva de Ispania y este a su vez probablemente de una palabra púnica, con el significado de tierra de conejos, aunque hay otras posibilidades (ver Etimología en el punto 1 de este mismo artículo). Por primera vez aparece con sentido histórico en Tito Livio 59 adC, que habla de Hispania y de hispani (hispanos, con sentido unitario).<br>  <br>   <br>  Acueducto de SegoviaLos habitantes de Hispania adoptaron la cultura romana, su lengua y sus leyes, adquiriendo gran importancia dentro del imperio, puesto que incluso tres emperadores romanos, Trajano, Adriano y Teodosio, además del filósofo Lucio Anneo Séneca y otros personajes importantes, nacieron en la península.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edad Media<br>  En el a?o 409, tribus germanas de suevos, alanos y vándalos invadieron la península ibérica. Pocos a?os después, en el 416, otra tribu germánica, los visigodos, entraron en Hispania como aliados de Roma, expulsando a alanos y vándalos y arrinconando a los suevos en Galicia. Los visigodos establecerían un reinado que perduraría hasta principios del siglo siglo VIII, del cual destaca fundamentalmente la conversión de los visigodos del arrianismo al catolicismo y las luchas contra los suevos, los bizantinos, los francos y los vascones. El carácter electivo de la monarquía visigótica determinó casi siempre una enorme inestabilidad política caracterizada por continuas rebeliones y asesinatos.<br>  <br>  En el a?o 689 los árabes invaden Melilla.<br>  <br>  El a?o 711 se inició la invasión musulmana de la península, convirtiéndose ésta en un emirato, o provincia del imperio árabe llamada Al-ándalus, con capital en la ciudad de Córdoba.<br>  <br>  El avance musulmán fue rápido. En el 712 cayó Toledo, la capital Visigoda. Desde entonces fueron avanzando hacia el norte, y todas las ciudades fueron capitulando. En el 716 controlaban toda la península, aunque en el norte era más bien nominal que militar. A partir de entonces dirigieron sus esfuerzos hacia el otro lado de los Pirineos contra el reino Carolingio. Esto permitió revueltas en la poco controlada zona noroeste de la Península.<br>  <br>   <br>  La Muralla de ávila, construida en la Edad MediaDespués de la caída del Reino Visigodo la península quedó dominada hasta la cordillera cantábrica, donde estaban los pueblos astures, cántabros y vascones, escasamente sometidos al reino godo y dada su escasa importancia no sufrieron demasiada presión del Islam, que había sustituido al poder ejercido por el reino godo. Muchos de los se?ores godos o hispano-romanos se convirtieron al Islam y conservaron sus posiciones. En el a?o 718 en la actual Asturias un noble godo llamado Pelayo se subleva contra los musulmanes. La sublevación fracasa y es detenido. Hacia el 722 vuelve a intentarlo y tiene lugar lo que la historiografía castellana denominó la Batalla de Covadonga, donde Pelayo y un grupo de astures y de nobles visigodos vencieron a una expedición de castigo musulmana. Este hito sirvió para marcar la época de fundación del Reino de Asturias y dar inicio al periodo conocido como la Reconquista, entendido como el restablecimiento de la Espa?a anterior a la invasión musulmana.<br>  <br>  En la parte nororiental de la península y en la Septimania goda, los godos que habían huido al reino de los Francos pidieron ayuda a estos. Así Carlomagno emprendió una serie de campa?as militares con la intención de establecer un territorio de distensión militar, más conocida como Marca. La Marca Hispánica se constituyó a principios del siglo IX para evitar la penetración de los musulmanes en el territorio del Reino de los Francos. Así fue como los francos dividieron en ese territorio en diversos condados donde se?ores feudales de origen franco o godo representaban al rey de los francos, teniendo por lo tanto un desarrollo diferente al que experimentaron los reinos cristianos ibéricos occidentales. Estos condados en pleno proceso de feudalización se emanciparían del dominio franco de facto después de la crisis carolingia del siglo IX, al empezar a transmitirse hereditariamente los condados, si bien hasta 988 los condes de Barcelona renovaron el pacto de vasallaje con los reyes francos.<br>  <br>  Los siglos VIII y IX significarían un creciente poderío musulmán en la península, a pesar de los núcleos cristianos del norte. En el siglo X, Abderramán III convierte Al-ándalus en califato independiente de Damasco, con autonomía religiosa siendo una época de pujanza cultural, gracias a las innovaciones en las ciencias y en las letras y la especial atención que dedicaron al desarrollo de las ciudades. Las ciudades más importantes fueron Valencia, Zaragoza, Sevilla y Córdoba, la cual llegó a ser en el siglo X la mayor ciudad de Europa Occidental, contando con 500 000 habitantes y centro cultural de la época. Sin embargo, la decadencia llegó en el siglo XI, cuando comenzaron las pugnas entre las distintas familias reales musulmanas y el califato se desmembró en un mosaico de peque?os reinos, llamados de taifas.<br>  <br>   <br>  Interior de la Mezquita-Catedral de CórdobaMientras tanto, cerca de los Pirineos aparecieron otros dos reinos cristianos: Navarra y Aragón. Al avanzar la expansión cristiana por la península, el Reino de Asturias dio lugar a otros como el de León, así como los condados de Castilla (posteriormente Reino) y el de Galicia (que daría origen al Reino de Portugal). Al largo de los siglos XI al XII estos reinos se dividieron y refusionaron hasta quedar sólo cuatro reinos cristianos en la península: el Reino de Castilla, la Corona de Aragón, que se había constituido mediante la unión dinástica en 1150 del Reino de Aragón y el Condado de Barcelona, el Reino de Navarra y el Reino de Portugal. Así como toda una serie de reinos de Taifa musulmanes.<br>  <br>  En el siglo XIII, Castilla, el más pujante de los reinos hispánicos, amplió sus dominios hacia el sur peninsular, mientras que la Corona de Aragón, formada, como hemos dicho, por el Reino de Aragón y los Condados catalanes, a?adiría los reinos de Valencia y de Mallorca con el Rey Jaime I el Conquistador, y posteriormente formarían parte de esta Corona: Cerde?a, Sicilia y otros territorios del Oriente mediterráneo.<br>  <br>  A finales de este periodo,1402, el Reino de Castilla inició la conquista de las islas Canarias, estas fueron ocupadas por parte de se?ores normandos que rendían vasallaje a este reino (si bien Portugal también tendrá pretensiones de dominio sobre este territorio). Este proceso de conquista no concluirá hasta 1496-1497.<br>  <br>   <br>  Rendición de Granada a los Reyes Católicos Mientras en la Corona de Aragón, como resultado de la gran mortandad provocada por la epidemia de la Gran Peste de 1348, así como de las malas cosechas, que empezaron con el ciclo de 1333 ("lo mal any primer"), provocaron una gran inestabilidad tanto social, como económica. A la muerte del Rey Martín I el Humano (1410), los representantes de los Reinos que constituían la Corona de Aragón, eligieron en el Compromiso de Caspe a Fernando de Antequera, de la castellana Casa de Trastámara como futuro rey Fernando I en quien recaían por herencia materna los derechos dinásticos. A pesar de una revuelta protagonizada por el Conde de Urgel, Fernando I fue coronado y comenzó el reinado de los Trastámara en la Corona de Aragón. Después de la expansión por el Reino de Nápoles, en el periodo de Alfonso V, la Corona de Aragón sufrió una profunda crisis provocadas por así las disputas entre Juan II, hijo del de Antequera, y la Generalidad y el Consell de Cent (Consejo de Ciento), debida a la detención de su hijo y heredero Carlos de Viana, así como por las tensiones de las clases sociales entre la Busca y la Biga y las revueltas de los campesinos de "Remensa" que coincidieron con la Guerra Civil Catalana (1462 - 1472) acabaron de debilitar a la ya débil Corona aragonesa. Con la subida al trono de Fernando el Católico, segundo hijo y heredero de Juan II, (1479) las tensiones sociales se redujeron, con la firma de la Sentencia Arbitral de Guadalupe (1486) se asentó una nueva estructura en el campo catalán para acabar con la conflictividad del medio rural.<br>  <br>  En 1497 se toma Melilla.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edad Moderna<br>   <br>  Monumento a Colón (Madrid) <br>  S.M. el Rey Felipe IIAl final de la edad media, con el matrimonio de Isabel de Castilla y Fernando de Aragón, estos dos grandes reinos peninsulares se aliaron, conquistando el reino de Granada en 1492 y, posteriormente, el de Navarra en 1512. También comenzaron una política matrimonial con Portugal que culminó en 1580, cuando Felipe II de Espa?a subió a su trono, uniendo por última vez toda la península ibérica.<br>  <br>  En 1492, se decreta la expulsión de los judíos que no hubiesen aceptado la conversión al cristianismo, imitando a Felipe IV de Francia. Cristóbal Colón, en nombre de los Reyes Católicos, llega, por primera vez, a América con sus naves. Empieza la carrera por la exploración y conquista de las tierras americanas, a la que se unirían posteriormente otros países como Portugal, Francia e Inglaterra. La Monarquía Espa?ola se convierte, en un proceso iniciado al final de la Reconquista, en la nación más poderosa e influyente del mundo.<br>  <br>  Tras la muerte de Isabel la Católica, en 1504, su hija Juana la sucede en el trono de Castilla. Juana estaba casada con Felipe I, al que llamaron el Hermoso, hijo del Archiduque de Austria y Emperador del Sacro Imperio Romano-Germánico. Felipe muere muy joven y a Juana se la incapacita por loca.<br>  <br>  Su hijo Carlos I de Espa?a hereda las Coronas de Castilla y Aragón, además del sacro Imperio Romano-Germánico y las posesiones de la Casa de Borgo?a. En su madurez, decide retirarse a la vida religiosa recluyéndose en el Monasterio de Yuste (Cáceres) en 1556. Su hijo Felipe II hereda la Corona de Espa?a con todas sus posesiones y su hermano Fernando I de Habsburgo el Sacro Imperio Romano-Germánico.<br>  <br>  Felipe II de Espa?a se corona rey de Portugal en 1580 con el nombre de Felipe I de Portugal. El ordinal "segundo" lo mantuvo para respetar la vía castellana (Felipe I de Castilla fue Felipe el Hermoso). Durante su reinado se producen la gran victoria de Lepanto en 1571 con la que se consiguió frenar la expansión de los turcos en el Mediterráneo y la desastrosa aventura de la Grande y Felicísima Armada en 1588.<br>  <br>  Espa?a, y en mayor medida Castilla, dada la prohibición de comercio para la Corona de Aragón, sigue prosperando bajo la dinastía Habsburgo, gracias al comercio con las colonias americanas; pero al mismo tiempo sostiene guerras contra Francia, Inglaterra y las Provincias Unidas.<br>  <br>  Cuando el último rey de la dinastía de los Habsburgo, Carlos II de Espa?a, murió sin descendencia; Felipe de Borbón, sobrino nieto de Carlos II y nieto del rey de Francia, Luis XIV, le sucedió en el trono con el nombre de Felipe V de Espa?a, siendo aceptado y jurado por todos los territorios de Espa?a. A los pocos a?os de reinado, se produce la Guerra de Sucesión Espa?ola.<br>  <br>  Entre 1707 y 1716, los Decretos de Nueva Planta de Felipe V suprimen o reducen los fueros y costumbres de los reinos y territorios que habían luchado contra él en la Guerra de Sucesión.<br>  <br>  Algunos quieren ver en estos decretos una unificación legal de Espa?a, pero, por un lado, los decretos, al ser diferentes para Valencia, Aragón (donde primero fue igual que el de Valencia, pero luego fue modificado), Baleares y Catalu?a, afectaron de forma diferente a cada territorio, y además, tanto Navarra como las Provincias Vascongadas y el Valle de Arán, que no habían faltado a su juramento de lealtad a Felipe V, siguieron manteniendo sus fueros. En 1713, Espa?a firma el Tratado de Utrecht con el que pierde sus posesiones europeas y, por tanto, deja de ser la primera potencia mundial.<br>  <br>  El resto del siglo XVIII, fue el siglo de la Ilustración. Fernando VI y Carlos III, hijos y sucesores de Felipe V, hacen una política de renovación que modernizó Espa?a, en lo que se conoce como Despotismo Ilustrado. En este siglo, si bien Espa?a continúa siendo una importante potencia, Francia y el Reino Unido pasan a ocupar un protagonismo cada vez mayor en el escenario internacional.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edad Contemporánea<br>  La edad contemporánea no empezó muy bien para Espa?a, en 1805, en la Batalla de Trafalgar la escuadra hispano-francesa fue derrotada ante Gran Breta?a, con lo que significa el fin de la supremacía espa?ola en los mares mundiales a favor de Gran Breta?a, mientras Napoleón que había tomado el poder tras triunfar la Revolución Francesa, aprovechando las disputas entre Carlos IV y su hijo Fernando, ordenó el envío de su ejército contra Espa?a en 1808, imponiendo a su hermano José I en el trono. Ello ocasiona la Guerra de Independencia, que duraría 5 a?os. En ese tiempo se elaboró la primera Constitución espa?ola, y una de las primeras del mundo, en las denominadas Cortes de Cádiz. Fue promulgada el 19 de marzo de 1812, festividad de S. José, por lo que popularmente se la conocía como La Pepa. Tras la derrota de las tropas de Napoleón en la batalla de Vitoria en 1813; Fernando VII vuelve al trono de Espa?a. Deroga la Constitución y persigue a los liberales constitucionalistas, dando comienzo a un rígido absolutismo, al que sigue la pérdida de las principales posesiones espa?olas en América tras varias revoluciones lideradas por influyentes criollos como Bolívar y San Martín. A pesar de los esfuerzos realizados por Espa?a, al concluir el reinado, del antiguo imperio ultramarino tan solo quedan Cuba, Filipinas y Puerto Rico.<br>  <br>   <br>  S.M. la Reina Isabel IILa muerte de Fernando VII abre un periodo de fuerte inestabilidad política y económica, su hermano Carlos María Isidro se rebela contra la designación de su hija Isabel II como heredera, previa derogación de la Ley Sálica de la dinastía Borbón, que impedía la sucesión real de mujeres, en contra de la secular tradición espa?ola estallando la Primera Guerra Carlista. El Reinado de Isabel II se caracteriza por la alternancia en el poder de progresistas y moderados si bien esta alternancia se motiva más por pronunciamientos militares de ambos signos que por una pacífica cesión del poder en función de los resultados electorales.<br>  <br>  La revolución de 1868, denominada La gloriosa, obligó a Isabel II a abandonar Espa?a. Se convocaron Cortes Constituyentes que se pronunciaron por el régimen monárquico y, a iniciativa del General Prim, se ofrece la corona a Amadeo de Saboya, hijo del rey de Italia. Su reinado fue breve por el cansancio provocado por los políticos del momento y el rechazo de importantes sectores de la sociedad. Se proclamó la I República, que tampoco gozó de larga vida, aunque sí muy agitada: en once meses tuvo cuatro presidentes (Figueras, Pi i Margall, Salmerón y Castelar); durante este convulso periodo se produjeron graves tensiones territoriales llegándose a producir fenómenos tan pintorescos como la declaración de la ciudad de Cartagena como "Cantón independiente" y finalizó con los pronunciamientos de los generales Martínez Campos y Manuel Pavía, que disolvió el Parlamento.<br>  <br>  La Restauración proclama rey a Alfonso XII, hijo de Isabel II. Espa?a experimenta una gran estabilidad política debida al sistema de gobierno preconizado por el político conservador Antonio Cánovas del Castillo. Se basa en el turno de los partidos Conservador (Cánovas del Castillo) y Liberal (Sagasta) en el gobierno. En 1885 murió Alfonso XII y se encargó la regencia a su viuda Maria Cristina, hasta la mayoría de edad de su hijo Alfonso XIII, nacido tras la muerte de su padre. La rebelión independentista de Cuba en 1895 induce a los Estados Unidos a intervenir en la zona y, tras el confuso incidente de la explosión del acorazado Maine el 15 de febrero de 1898 en el puerto de La Habana, declara la guerra a Espa?a. Con la derrota, Espa?a perdió sus últimas colonias (Cuba, Filipinas, Guam y Puerto Rico) en ultramar.<br>  <br>  <br>  Siglo XX<br>  El siglo XX comienza con una gran crisis económica y, la subsiguiente, inestabilidad política. Hay un paréntesis de prosperidad comercial, propiciado por la neutralidad espa?ola en la Primera Guerra Mundial. La sucesión de crisis gubernamentales, la marcha desfavorable de la guerra en el Rif, la agitación social y el descontento de parte del ejército, desembocan en el Golpe de Estado del general Primo de Rivera, el 13 de septiembre de 1923. Estableció una dictadura militar que fue aceptada por gran parte de las fuerzas sociales y por el propio rey Alfonso XIII.<br>  <br>   <br>  S.M. el Rey Alfonso XIIIDurante la dictadura se suprimen libertades y derechos. La difícil coyuntura económica y el crecimiento de los partidos republicanos hace la situación cada vez más insostenible. En 1930, Primo de Rivera presenta su dimisión al rey y marcha a París, donde muere al poco tiempo. Le sucedió en la jefatura del Directorio el general, Dámaso Berenguer; y, después, por breve tiempo, el almirante Aznar. Este período fue denominado Dictablanda.<br>  <br>  Decidido a devolver la soberanía al pueblo y restablecer la Constitución, el Rey propicia la celebración de elecciones municipales del 12 de abril de 1931, éstas dieron la victoria a las candidaturas republicanas en las grandes ciudades, aunque el cómputo general invertía ese resultado. Hubo revueltas organizadas exigiendo la instauración de la Republica, lo que lleva al rey a abandonar el país. Una vez el rey abandona sus obligaciones se proclama la II República el 14 de abril.<br>  <br>  Durante la República se produce una gran agitación política y social, marcada por una acusada radicalización de izquierdas y derechas. Los líderes moderados son boicoteados y cada parte pretende crear una Espa?a a su medida. Durante los dos primeros a?os, gobierna una coalición de partidos republicanos y socialistas. En las elecciones celebradas en 1933, triunfan las derechas y en 1936, las izquierdas. La creciente ola de violencia incluye quema de iglesias, la sublevación monárquica de Sanjurjo, la revolución de 1934 y numerosos atentados contra líderes rivales.<br>  <br>  El 17 de julio se sublevan las guarniciones del áfrica Espa?ola, dando comienzo la Guerra Civil. Espa?a queda dividida en dos zonas: una bajo la autoridad del gobierno republicano y otra controlada por los sublevados, en la que el general Francisco Franco sería nombrado Jefe de Estado. El apoyo alemán e italiano a los sublevados, mucho más firme que el soporte de la Unión Soviética y México a la Espa?a republicana, y los continuos enfrentamientos entre las facciones republicanas, permitieron la victoria de los sublevados el 1 de abril de 1939.<br>  <br>  La victoria del general Franco supuso la instauración de un régimen autoritario. El desarrollo de una fuerte represión sobre los vencidos, obligó al exilio a miles de espa?oles y condenó a otros tantos a la muerte o al internamiento en campos de trabajo. A pesar de que Franco mantuvo al país neutral en la II Guerra Mundial, su no disimulado apoyo a las potencias del Eje, condujo a un aislamiento internacional de carácter político y económico. No obstante, los condicionamientos de la guerra fría entre Estados Unidos y la Unión Soviética hacen que el régimen franquista sea tolerado por las potencias occidentales y finalmente reconocido por las mismas con lo finaliza el aislamiento. Se firman acuerdos con Estados Unidos permitiendo la instalación de bases militares conjuntas hispano-norteamericanas en Espa?a. En 1956, Marruecos, que había sido protectorado espa?ol y francés, adquiere su independencia y se pone en marcha un plan de estabilización económica del país. En 1969, Franco nombra a Juan Carlos de Borbón, nieto de Alfonso XIII, príncipe de Espa?a, su sucesor a título de Rey. A pesar de que el régimen mantuvo una férrea represión contra cualquier oposición política, el desarrollo industrial y económico espa?ol resultó muy importante durante la dictadura.<br>  <br>   <br>  S.M. el Rey Juan Carlos, en las monedas espa?olas de 2€.El dictador murió en 1975. Juan Carlos I es proclamado rey. Se abre un periodo conocido como Transición. Culminará con el establecimiento de una Monarquía Constitucional en 1978, después de la renuncia a sus derechos históricos realizada por D. Juan de Borbón, padre del rey. Tras las primeras elecciones democráticas, Adolfo Suárez, del partido Unión de Centro Democrático (centro-derecha), fue elegido presidente de Gobierno. Lleva a cabo importantes reformas políticas e inicia las negociaciones para la entrada de Espa?a en la Comunidad Económica Europea. Dimite en 1981. Durante este periodo la banda terrorista vasca ETA comete un gran número de atentados ,especialmente contra miembros del ejército y de las fuerzas de seguridad, así como otros de carácter indiscriminado. En la misma ceremonia de investidura del sucesor de Suárez, Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo(UCD), el 23 de febrero (23-F), tuvo lugar un intento de golpe de Estado promovido por varios altos mandos militares. El Congreso de Diputados es tomado por el teniente coronel, Tejero. El intento fue abortado el mismo día, teniendo lugar la intervención del Rey Juan Carlos en defensa del orden constitucional. En 1981 se firma en Bruselas el protocolo de adhesión a la OTAN, dando inicio al proceso de integración en la Alianza que termina en la primavera de 1982, durante el gobierno de UCD.<br>  <br>   <br>  S.M. el Rey Juan Carlos IEn las elecciones siguientes (1982), venció el Partido Socialista Obrero Espa?ol, con Felipe González como presidente de gobierno. Se mantendría en el poder durante las tres siguientes legislaturas. En 1985, Espa?a en 1986 se une a la, entonces, Comunidad Económica Europea. En 1992, Espa?a aparece de forma llamativa en el escenario internacional con la celebración de los Juegos Olímpicos en Barcelona, la declaración de Madrid como Ciudad Cultural Europea y la celebración en Sevilla de la Exposición Universal EXPO 92. Las elecciones de 1996 dieron la victoria al Partido Popular, con José María Aznar como presidente, cargo que ejerció hasta las elecciones generales de 2004.<br>  <br>  <br>  Siglo XXI<br>  El siglo XXI empieza con los efectos del 11 de septiembre de 2001, que llevaron a Espa?a a implicarse en dos conflictos: la ocupación de Afganistán y la invasión de Iraq. Este último conflicto y el atentado de Al Qaeda en Madrid provocaron un distanciamiento entre el gobierno y gran parte de la opinión pública espa?ola. Todo ello desembocó en el cambio de gobierno, tras las elecciones democráticas del 14 de marzo de 2004.<br>  <br>  El euro, moneda oficial en la llamada ?Zona Euro? de Europa desde 1999, se convirtió en la moneda de cambio oficial el 1 de enero de 2002, reemplazando a la peseta. Los ciudadanos lo empezaron a usar en la vida cotidiana, a pesar de las protestas por la subida encubierta de los precios que supuso este cambio de moneda.<br>  <br>  En los últimos 10 a?os Espa?a ha recibido a una gran cantidad de inmigrantes de países hispanoamericanos como Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, México, Perú, Bolivia, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, República Dominicana, Cuba, Puerto Rico; así como de diferentes zonas de áfrica y Europa. En la actualidad. Espa?a es la octava mayor economía del mundo, lo que unido a su sistema de gobierno, basado en una de las democracias más tolerantes y prósperas del mundo, supone un atractivo para la inmigración.<br>  <br>   <br>  José Luis Rodríguez ZapateroAl término de la segunda legislatura de gobierno del Partido Popular, hubo un gran atentado terrorista: el del 11 de marzo de 2004 (reivindicado por Al Qaeda) contra trenes de cercanías en Madrid. Se cobró la vida de 192 personas. Tras este atentado, el país vivió unos días de gran movilización ciudadana, con acusaciones cruzadas en referencia a estos hechos entre el partido que apoyaba al gobierno de ese momento y los demás partidos del arco parlamentario. Polémica que aún hoy permanece activa.<br>  <br>  El Partido Socialista Obrero Espa?ol ganó las elecciones del 14 de marzo de 2004, convirtiéndose José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero en el quinto presidente del gobierno de la democracia. Con Zapatero como presidente del gobierno y, atendiendo a su compromiso electoral, se retiran las tropas que permanecían en Iraq. Ello ocasiona un considerable enfriamiento de las relaciones diplomáticas con los Estados Unidos. Se firma la Constitución Europea y se realiza el referéndum de la Constitución Europea, en el que los ciudadanos espa?oles aprueban el tratado. También se aprueba el matrimonio homosexual, entre otras reformas de carácter social prometidas en el programa de este gobierno.

Los orígenes del Reino de Espa?a pueden buscarse en la unión matrimonial de los reinos medievales de Castilla y Aragón —a su vez formados por la unión de otros reinos anteriores— a finales del siglo XV durante el reinado de los Reyes Católicos, cuando se produce la unificación política, completada con la incorporación del Reino de Navarra, el Reino de Granada y otros territorios. Un proceso de unificación institucional posterior ocurre durante el reinado de Felipe V, que configura una forma de estado centralizada a través de los Decretos de Nueva Planta.<br>  <br>  Consta de 17 comunidades autónomas y 2 ciudades autónomas que tienen un amplio nivel de autonomía, poderes legislativos, presupuestarios, administrativos y ejecutivos en las competencias exclusivas que el Estado garantiza a cada comunidad a través de la Constitución y de cada Estatuto de autonomía.<br>  <br>  A su vez cada comunidad autónoma se divide en una o varias provincias, haciendo un total de 50.<br>  <br>  Desde 2003 y para fines estadísticos, basadas en las normativas europeas y fijadas por la Eurostat, se encuentran las unidades NUTS en vigor en la Unión Europea.

Bueno aquí en Mexico también se le conoce como la madre patria, se que por alla por el siglo 15 fueron los reyes católicos los únicos que creyeron en las ideas de un navegante genovés llamado Cristóbal Colon para encontrar una nueva ruta hacia las indias, pero por error llego a un nuevo continente, debido a esto Espa?a llevó la delantera en la conquista y posterior colonización del nuevo mundo, se que las culturas pre-hispánicas que en aquel tiempo existían fueron despojadas de sus tesoros y de sus creencias,los espa?oles trataban de llevarse mas oro del que sus barcos podían cargar muchos se hundían en el océano con todo y su preciosa carga.<br>  Pero esto ya es historia. en la actualidad de Espa?a se que es un país lleno de historia, y de cultura que en parte  compartimos, que tienen un aeropuerto en madrid llamado barajas, que el due?o del atlético de Madrid se llama jesus gil, que de alla viene una empresa llamada gas natural, y que se esta sirviendo con la cuchara grande con los precios del gas aca en el norte de mexico, que su ex presidente José Maria Aznar los metió en un problema por andar haciéndole caso al pu?etas de bush y tony blair, que su moneda era la peseta espa?ola, pero que ya no se usa, ahora usan el poderoso Euro, aca abundan los chistes de gallegos porque supuestamente son muy tontos, se que sobre todo en la capital de Espa?a hay muchos moteros, debido a que alla los conductores de autos tienen una muy alta cultura de respeto al motociclista. y que hay unas tias muy hermosas en toda Espa?a.|`|5a47e3f94607dc24d1b9f733cb98a8abaa	Que ha sido dura..y es...la vida de los espa?oles y de los extranjeros aquí.

nYSgIKW9aa	ok, there's a thing called an "absolute threshold"<br>  when an impulse is strong enough that this point is met or exceeded, our muscles respond<br>  if the impulse isn't strong enough, the treshold isn't met, and our muscles don't respond<br>  <br>  so...in basic terms, it means that a muscle isn't going to contract unless the treshold is met<br>  if it's not met, the muscles don't contract at all<br>  it might be easier to understand if you think of it as "threshold or nothing" law|`|jjWkN0Muaa	From what I remember, it has to do with the actin and myosin in your muscles.  These are the motors in your muscles that essentially pull on each other so your muscles can contract.  <br>  <br>  This 'all or none' phenomenon is just referring to the fact that this actin and myosin pair can either contract 100% or contract 0%.  There is no contracting ie. 50% with these two molecules.  <br>  <br>  The strength of contraction of ie. your bicep is due to the NUMBER of actin and myosin pair contracting, and NOT the degree that an actin myosin pair contracted.<br>  <br>  Think of a regular light bulb and switch.  It can either be ON or OFF.  There is no 'dimming' in the middle.  (I'm not talking about those fancy lights with dimming capabilities!)<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|Kbz8XEf9aa	it has to do with an action potential. when an axon sends a chemical message to another axon or dendrite it causes a depolorazation and sodium channels open. once all the sodium channels are open it reaches a threshold..and an impule is fired. This means that with muscles..once a message is sent..it either fires (responds) or doesnt at all. im trying to make it simple lol...hope that helped..there is much more detail involved

gM8GCbyRaa	1) Start by calling the 2 unknown numbers x and y. Now we know their sum is -18, so x+y=-18 and their difference is 8, so x-y=8. So x+y=-18 and x-y=8 are the two equations. Now to solve them, I think the easiest way for you to understand is substitution, so let's do that. Solve the first equation for x. So x=-18-y. Then take what we just found and plug it into the second equation. So (-18-y)-y=8 because we know x=-18-y. Then just solve that. -18-2y=8. So -2y=26. Thus, y=-13.

E0U2yII3aa	Sirius B is even hotter than Sirius A. Its surface temperature of 24,800K is more than twice Sirius A's surface temperature of 9,980K. So that would make it more than 4x as hot as the sun. However, Sirius B is only 92% as large as the Earth which if we sum all its luminosity compared to the sun, it would be only 2.4%. To calculate the total luminosity of a star you need radius and surface temperature. Temperature would be very high for Sirius B but the radius is exponentially small. It is a white dwarf now, a stellar remnant of a 5-7 solar mass B-star that has thrown its outer layers about 125 million years ago. All that is left is a 1-solar mass white dwarf that continues to cool down as it ages. The heat is the residual heat left from the core of the star ever since it had thrown its remaining gas in a planetary nebula.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.astro.uiuc.edu/~jkaler/sow/sirius.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.astro.uiuc.edu/~jkaler/sow/si...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.solstation.com/stars/sirius2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.solstation.com/stars/sirius2....</a>|`|zFsTSrOcaa	Sirius B is the remnant core of a old star which has shed its outer layers during its red-giant and planetary-nebula stages.

It may be hotter than the sun, but it's so much smaller that it radiates only a tiny fraction of what the sun does.|`|W2suykEtaa	B is a tiny white dwarf.<br>  <br>  actually, that answers both your questions.<br>  <br>  bye.|`|LGBNKuxRaa	it's the remains of the core of a now-dead star. stellar cores are way hotter than the surface, but as there's nothing keeping it hot now, it'll just keep cooling down. luminosity and temperature are (more or less) independent variables. it's hot, but it's not radiating much energy, I think. not sure on that... anyway, it's also small, as pointed out above. I'm not sure which factor is more important.

gReXjl6Kaa	Back titration is an analytical chemistry technique that allows the user to find the concentration of a reactant of unknown concentration by reacting it with an excess volume of another reactant of known concentration. The resulting mixture is then titrated back, taking into account the molarity of the excess that was added.<br>  <br>  Assume you have a base with one OH- capacity and you want to know it's molarity, so the solution is titration of that base with an acid (HCl). after titration you found out the endpoint of the titration can not be easily detectable because the endpoint is not sharp enough. So at this time back titration is a good choice. you should add more HCl than the amount of HCl which is needed to reach the end point and then titrate the excessive amount of HCl with NaOH because this titration will give you a sharp endpoint to determine the exact volume of the titrant.<br>  <br>  here is an example: <br>  you have 25ml of a base with unknown molarity, after doing a titration by HCl (0.1M). you find out the endpoint is not sharp enough and the end point is nearly reached when you add 30ml of HCl. Therefore you should add 50ml of HCl and then titrate excessive HCl with NaOH.<br>  you know the the volume of NaOH (from titration) you know molarity of HCl and NaOH because you have made them yourself as standard solutions, so you can calculate the volume of HCl which is titrated by NaOH (assume the volume is 21.6ml) and after calculation you should minus it from 50ml.<br>  50 -20.6 = 29.4ml <br>  so 29.4ml is the volume of HCl needed for titration of the base.<br>  you know their volume and also you know the molarity of HCl, therefore you can calculate the exact molarity of the base which was impossible by normal titration (or direct titration) by HCl.

Alcanza con considerar 2 puntos llamados "focos" (F1 y F2) y con tener una cuerda que mida más que la distancia entre los focos.  Colocas los extremos de la cuerda en ellos y tensas la misma con un lápiz.  La curva que vas a ir graficando al moverlo es una elipse.<br>  <br>  Para graficar una parábola tienes que trazar una recta, llamada directriz (d) y un punto, llamado foco (F), que no pertenezca a d.  Luego haces una perpendicular e a la directriz d que pase por el foco y que va a ser el eje de la parábola.  Cualquier punto que obtengas puede ser simetrizado usando el eje de la parábola.  Para obtener un punto de la parábola, consideras una perpendicular r a la directriz que no sea el eje, consideras su punto de corte P y el segmento PF.  Trazas su mediatriz.  La intersección de la mediatriz con r es un punto de la parábola.

8831f92a9f1e869a6a8c2015b38f4d33aa	Augustus<br>  C. Octavianus (63 v. - 14 n. Chr) war Gro?neffe C?sars und wurde von diesem adoptiert und zum Erben eingesetzt; seitdem trug er den Namen C. lulius Caesar Octavianus.<br>  <br>  Nach C?sars Tod verweigerte ihm Antonius die Erbschaft. Im zweiten Triumvirat verst?ndigte er sich jedoch vorübergehend mit Antonius. Mit Hilfe von Proskriptionen wurden die Gegner der im Triumvirat Verbündeten vernichtet. Zu den Opfern geh?rte auch Cicero (43 v. Chr.ermordet). Nach dem Sieg über die C?sar-M?rder bei Philippi im Jahre 42 v. Chr. teilte sich Augustus die Herrschaft mit Antonius und Lepidus.In der Schlacht bei Actium (31 v. Chr.) besiegte er dann aber Antonius und begann mit einer Neuordnung des Staates. ?u?erlich bewahrte er die Formen der r?mischen Republik, indem er die Aufgaben des Senatsund der Magistrate unangetastet lie?. Er nannte sich 'princeps' ("erster Bürger"), bekleidete mehrere traditionelle ?mter und war Oberbefehlshaber des Heeres. <br>  <br>  Seine geschichtliche Leistung und die Grundlage seines Ansehens bestanden vor allem darin, dass ihm die Beendigung des Bürgerkrieges gelungen war und unter ihm eine lange Friedensperiode einsetzte (vgl Ara pacis Augustae). Augustus versuchte, an altr?mischen Traditionen festzuhaltenund altr?mische Wert- und Normvorstellungen neu zu beleben,  f?rderte Künstler und Dichter, die seine politischen Vorstellungen propagandistisch unterstützten (z. B. Livius,Vergil), verringerte die Arbeitslosigkeit durch ein ausgedehntes Bauprogramm, erweiterte und sicherte die Reichsgrenzen, musste allerdings auch Niederlagen hinnehmen (Niederlage des Varus bei Kalkriese gegen Arminius 9 n. Chr.). <br>  <br>  27 v. Chr. verlieh ihm der Senat den Ehrentitel Augustus ("der Erhabene"). In einem Mausoleum auf dem Marsfeld in Rom wurde er nach seinemTode am 19. August 14 n. Chr. beigesetzt. Der Monat August wurde nach ihm benannt. Die meisten sp?teren Kaiser übernahmen den Titel 'Augustus'. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Kaiser Augustus<br>  <br>  Augustus war der erste r?mische Kaiser (27 v. Chr.-14 n. Chr.). Er stellte nach einem langem Bürgerkrieg den Frieden im R?mischen Reich wieder (Pax Augusta). Trotz der blutigen Ausschaltung seiner Gegner ist seine Herrschaft (Augusteisches Zeitalter) als Epoche des Friedens, des Wohlstandes und der kulturellen Blüte bekannt. Augustus war ferner der Begründer des r?mischen Kaisertums (Prinzipat). Die Machtstellung des Princeps beruhte rechtlich auf einer Reihe ihm verliehener Sondergewalten, faktisch auf dem Oberbefehl über das Heer, einer gro?en Gefolgschaft und einem gro?en Privatverm?gen, in der ?ffentlichen Meinung auf dem Ansehen, das er sich als Sohn des zum Gott erhobenen Caesar und als oberster Priester und durch seine Taten erworben hatte. Die republikanischen Tendenzen dr?ngte Augustus zugunsten der monarchischen immer mehr in den Hintergrund, ohne dass sie jedoch ganz verschwanden.<br>  <br>  <br>  Kindheit und Jugend des Gaius Octavius<br>  <br>  <br>  Augustus wurde am 23. September 63 v. Chr. als Gaius Octavius in Rom geboren. Sein Vater war der r?mische Pr?tor Gaius Octaius, seine Mutter Atia, eine Nichte Caesars. Gaius Octavius war also ein Gro?neffe von Julius Caesars, der ihn in seinem Testament adoptierte und zum Haupterben machte. Caesar f?rderte Gaius Octavius schon früh. Mit 16 erhob er ihn in das Priesterkollegium der Pontifices, das im r?mischen Staatskult eine zentrale Rolle spielte. In seinem für das Jahr 44 v. Chr. geplanten Feldzug gegen die Parther bestimmte Caesar ihn zum magister equitum (Reiterführer). Vor dem Partherfeldzug entsandte er ihn zu Studienzwecken nach Appolinia in Südillyrien. <br>  <br>  <br>  Octavian und das zweite Triumvirat<br>  <br>  Der junge Octavianus wollte seinen ermordeten Adoptivvater r?chen und in dem vom Bürgerkrieg befallenen Rom den Frieden wiederherstellen. Dabei geriet er besonders mit Marcus Antonius in Konflikt. Marcus Antonius war Caesars ehrgeiziger Weggef?hrte gewesen und hatte nach dessen Ermordung Caesars testamentarischen Nachlass an sich genommen und Octavian die Anerkennung verweigert. Octavianus wurde aber vom Volk und vor allem von Caesars Veteranen, aus deren Reihen er im Herbst 44 v. Chr. eine Privatarmee bildete, unterstützt. Mit Hilfe Ciceros gelang es ihm im Dezember 44 v. Chr., den Senat zur Legalisierung seiner Ansprüche und zum Bruch mit Antonius zu bewegen. Er wurde, obwohl er bisher noch kein Amt bekleidet hatte, in den Senat aufgenommen und als Heerführer mit pr?torischem Rang anerkannt. Anfang 43 v. Chr. k?mpfte Octavianus mit den Konsuln Hirtius und Pansa gegen Marcus Antonius und befreite den in Mutina (heute Modena) belagerten Decimus Brutus.<br>  <br>  Augustus als Alleinherrscher: Das Prinzipat<br>  <br>  Octavian war nun Alleinherrscher. Er musste den Staate neu ordnen und unter gr??tm?glicher Schonung der alten Formen seine eigene Machstellung legalisieren. Im Dezember 28 v. Chr. erkl?rte er alle vom Triumvirat getroffenen Entscheidungen und Anordnungen für ungültig. Am 13. Januar 27 v. Chr. gab er seine Sonderbefugnisse an den Senat und das Volk von Rom zurück. Er stellte so formal die republikanische Staatsform wieder her. Auf Bitten des Senats übernahm er jedoch zun?chst für zehn Jahre (die Frist wurde schlie?lich bis zu seinem Tod verl?ngert) die Grenzprovinzen ?gypten, Syrien, Gallien und Spanien und die dort stationierten Truppen, also den gr??ten Teil der r?mischen Truppen, um diese Provinzen zu befrieden und die Grenzen des R?mischen Reiches zu sichern. Am 16. Januar 27 v. Chr. verlieh ihm der Senat viele Ehren, u. a. den Ehrennamen Augustus ("der Erhabene"). Augustus erhielt den Bürgerkranz, Tugendschild und zwei Lorbeerb?ume (als Torschmuck), die alle bald zu Symbolen der neuen Monarchie wurden.|`|6b10e1b169fe0e3997418d3b152ebbaeaa	Warum sollen wir deine Schulaufgaben mache.

W?hrend seiner Herrschaft verliess er sich vollkommen auf erprobte Heerfüher, wie etwa Agrippa, der die Flotte in der Schlacht von Actium kommandiert hatte.

Aus dem Flugzeug betrachtet wirkt die drittgr??te, überwiegend bewaldete Insel Muhu wie der Stummelschwanz eines hoppelnden Hasen, dessen W?nstlein das mit ca 2700km2 viel gr??ere Saaremaa bildet. Seit 1895 verbindet das 198,5km2 runde Schwanzchen ein 3,6km langer Damm durch den Sund mit dem Leib. Den Anschlu? zum Festland besorgt eine moderne Autof?hre in knapp einer Stunde. In harten Wintern wird der Eispanzer der Meerenge zwischen den Hafen Virtsu und Kuivastu als Fahrzeugtra?e abgesteckt. Bedauerlicher oder von anderer Warte, glücklicher Weise dient das Inselchen heute nur dem Massentourismus und den Wochendfahrern als asphaltierte Querfeldeinstrecke zu den vielgepriesenen Sch?nheiten Saaremaas, das von den einst dort herrschenden Schweden ?sel genannt wurde. ? gleich Insel und Sel gleich Sieb. Ein weiterer Blick aus der H?he auf die vor dem Festland verstreuten Punkte und Pünktchen sieht diese Benennung best?tigt. Sie wirken wahrhaftig wie durch ein Sieb geschüttelt. Nach den Schweden mu?ten sie noch vielerlei Eindringlinge er- und überleben. Die letzten Besatzer, die Sowjets, riegelten die Inselgruppen sogar rigor?s ab und ernannten sie zu Hochburgen ihrer Westverteidigung. Muhu war also bis zur wiedererlangten estnischen Unabh?ngigkeit 1991 auf der Landkarte Europas ein wei?er Fleck. Für die meisten Festlandesten bedeutete es ein unbetretbares Stück Heimat und für die Insulaner einen bis an die von Schützengr?ben durchfurchte und jetzt von Wacholder überwucherte Küste reichenden Albtraum. Das sehr sp?rlich besiedelte Eiland hat nur 2200 in Stra?end?rfern zusammenlebende Einwohner, auf jedem Quadratkilometer etwa 12 Personen. Ihre Hauptverdienstquelle war früher der Fischfang, heute sind es fast ausschlie?lich die hier haltmachenden Touristen. Dabei hat die lütte Insel überw?ltigend viel aufzuweisen - Reiterh?fe, Pensionen und Fremdenlogies in schmucken Bauernh?usern, den noch erhaltenen und sukzessive zum Hotel restaurierten einzigen Herrensitz deutschen Uradels, Museen aller Art, darunter das urtümliche Museumsdorf Koguva, eine Kirche ohne Turm und selbstverst?ndlich eine jungfr?uliche, wildsprie?ende Landschaft, übers??t mit riesigen, legendenumwobenen, angeblich magiegeladenen eratischen Findlingen, die das Bild der Insel pr?gen.

The Muslims led the world with the newest technology, ideas, and inventions in all fields including Medicine, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Literature, Art, and Architecture and they have left their marks all over the world.  The Muslims invented trigonometry and algebra when this so-called glorious Europe was in the middle of its dark ages and when they thought that using soap and hot water was actually fatal for the human body.  People were hanged because they dared to practice this new magic called chemistry.  And the corrupted church would do anything to keep the ignorant public in dark and keep their own power.  Anybody could change the bible and call it "his" version.  Those barbarians would nothing but just wage wars and kill each other.  Just call someone a witch, and then they would either be burned alive or drowned, so if she actually swam to save herself, it was proof enough that she was a witch.

O nome provém do fato de a fêmea geralmente comer o macho após a cópula. Sua picada é muitas vezes fatal. No Brasil, é encontrada atualmente, próximo ao mar, sobretudo em praias pouco freqüentadas em torno da baía de Guanabara. Por ser uma aranha muito conhecida no Brasil e por saber-se que seu veneno é muito forte, há a alus?o de que esta é a aranha mais venenosa que existe. Mas a aranha mais venenosa do mundo é a armadeira, encontrada nas regi?es amaz?nica, sudeste e norte. Também é conhecida pelos nomes de aranha-do-linho e flamenguinha.<br>  fonte:<a href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi%C3%BAva-negra" rel="nofollow">http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi%C3%BAva-...</a><br>  .|`|98a0643d5c0cdfd4421105a7cf2b220daa	Prova ainda viva é D.

Elas vivem em muitas regi?es da Terra e calcula-se que picam cerca de 10 mil pessoas por ano, causando muitas mortes. No entanto, ser picado por uma viúva-negra dos Estados Unidos, da áfrica, da Austrália ou do Brasil n?o é a mesma coisa, pois as condi??es climáticas, a alimenta??o e a quantidade de veneno injetado s?o diferentes. A viúva-negra dos Estados Unidos é mortal, enquanto a do Brasil tem menor quantidade de veneno. Além disso, o efeito do veneno também depende da idade da pessoa, pois uma crian?a tem rea??es diferentes daquelas de um adulto. <br>  <br>  A viúva-negra é uma aranha pequena, mal chegando a um centímetro de comprimento. A maioria é negra, com manchas vermelhas no ventre, que formam uma figura que lembra uma ampulheta. Seu tamanho reduzido e suas cores preta e vermelha tornam fácil sua identifica??o. Além disso, onde vive uma dessas aranhas vivem centenas, cada uma formando teias emaranhadas por entre os galhos de arbustos. No Brasil a viúva-negra ocorre de norte a sul e de leste a oeste. Uma determinada espécie é cinzenta, com manchas amarelas, e sua picada é inofensiva. A espécie de cor negra, com manchas vermelhas, é mais rara.<br>  <br>  No local da picada dessa aranha n?o se percebe nada, mas a dor é intensa, mais concentrada nas articula??es e nos órg?os internos. A pessoa tem um pouco de febre e depois a temperatura do corpo vai baixando, aparecem calafrios, tremores, caimbras nas pernas, palpita??es, suores. <br>  <br>  A viúva-negra come filhotes de gafanhotos, grilos, baratas, saúvas, borboletas, besouros. As presas caem na teia e s?o imobilizadas por fios de teia. Eventualmente ela ca?a lagartixas e escorpi?es. Cada aranha defende com valentia a sua teia. Nenhuma invade o terreno da outra. Qualquer viola??o de domicílio redunda numa luta de morte. Elas, de fato, s?o sensíveis ao veneno de suas irm?s e sucumbem. Apenas os indefesos machos podem subir pela teia da fêmea e alimentar-se das sobras de suas refei??es. Após o acasalamento eles morrem, ficando seu cadáver suspenso na teia da fêmea. Esse fato, observado pelo povo, fez com que se concluísse que as fêmeas matam os machos após a cópula. Por isso, e por terem cor negra, elas ganharam o nome de viúva-negra|`|AA11822560	Cor de asno.|`|fE1X1Rf3aa	ah, bom...<br>  pensei que eram mulheres cujos parceiros faleceram... <br>  bom, essa n?o é minha área.. estou a fim de viuvas de preferência verdes... hehehe

Em condi??es normais ocorre devido a posi??o em que se dorme, principalmente quando o bra?o por algum momento fica sob o peso do corpo dificultando a circula??o, causando a sensa??o de dormência.

Mais quando você sai de cima do seu bra?o o sangue volta a circular, ent?o os tecidos ser?o oxigenados novamente e tudo voltará ao normal. Mais cuidado com isso, pois se muito tempo sem circular sangue em seu bra?o (mais de horas) seu sangue pode coagular, ai quando você sair de cima do bra?o esse sangue irá circular e quando passar pelas veias dos pulm?es que s?o mais finas, o sangue coagulado interromperá a passagem do sangue, ai a press?o irá ficar t?o grande, que os vasos estourar?o e você morrerá.

Ou seja, você vai atirá-la a V-50km/h. Mas a Terra "vai de encontro à pedra" ou seja, a velocidade final da pedra vai ser V-50+50 = V.<br>  <br>  Se você atirar para o Leste, vai ter a velocidade da pedra igual a V+50 mas a Terra "foge da pedra" e ent?o a velocidade final dela será V+50-50 = V.<br>  <br>  Com isso, ela vai à mesma distancia, n?o importa o lado que você atire a pedra.<br>  <br>  Por isso que, ao jogar um objeto de um prédio bem alto, ele n?o vai tocar a base do prédio por causa da rota??o.
