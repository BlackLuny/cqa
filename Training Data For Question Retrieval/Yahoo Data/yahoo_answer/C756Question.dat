20090220052350AAkDta2	Food & Drink;Other - Food & Drink	Have you noticed food fads?	A couple of years ago in the U.S. you started seeing chipotle (smoked jalapenos, not the restaurant) everywhere. Every restaurant, even McDonald’s, had a chipotle bbq sauce. You could find lot of recipes that used chipotle, and even some recipes with chipotle in the title that didn't actually use it all.       Now it is mini burgers. You can find them at Burger King, Apple Bee's, Ryan's steakhouse, etc. There's also an infomercial for a skillet that makes mini burgers.       Do food fads annoy you or do you like trying new things? Do you remember any food fads in the past or a have guess what one of the next fads will be?      Is chipotle or the mini burger popular outside of the U.S. ?
