20090128212239AAJYA9p	Computers & Internet;Internet;Other - Internet	Frustrated beyond comprehension with internet problems (MUST be) Computer Geniuses please help?(novelincluded)?	K... my computer, with Windows Vista installed started acting quirky yesterday morning. It would NOT sign onto Zune marketplace, and it was blocking random sites (download.com, microsoft.com, digg.com, and one of my favorite small websites to buy clothes, denimskirts.com (if it was a virus, WHY would it block THIS??!!))   I, for some reason, assumed that it was a virus. So, I downloaded, and ran Spybot Search and Destroy, AVG Antivirus, and Ad-Aware.    They found a few pidley things, but, to no avail... Zune Marketplace, and the few websites STILL did not work.   This annoyed me so much that I went to Best Buy and bought a $100 (50% off sale) copy of Windows XP so I could reformat an old crappy lappy that I had messed up trying to reformat with incomplete software from an internal drive, assuming that I will at least be able to run Zune Marketplace while I mull over my plan to attack this Vista problem on my nice expenny computer.      Just installed it, and SHOCK?!!! It's blocking the SAME sites that my other computer is.      And yes, I am using the same wireless network that I used with my Windows Vista computer, so... I guess it might be the network, but...   Here's the kicker...    My little bro's Window's Vista computer runs all of the aforementioned sites JUST FINE. Although, he did say that he vaguely remembers maybe deleting a process that was running (I doubt THAT would fix it, if my new and pristine Windows XP reformatted laptop is doing the same thing that my Vista compy is doing), or maybe he reset the IP address, but he can't remember which (if that's the case, I don't know how to reset the IP address, but I don't see how that could fix it either)   He can't remember what he did to fix it.    Mind you, when he said it was "broke" he didn't run it by the litmus test of websites that BOTH of mine are failing to load while other websites seem fine, so... Maybe his never had a problem in the first place, but if THAT'S the case, it doesn't seem to make sense that my reformatted lappy that didn't have a virus in the first place, or in the last 2 years should get one now.      WHAT IS GOING ON?! I am going out of my MIND here?   Any idea what this problem could be?   Computer Geniuses, or genius wannabe's, PLEASE help?!   But, if anyone dares to ask "Have you tried Window's "System Restore"" Please, be forwarned that I will reach through your computer and strangle you.    Yes. I'm that frustrated. :-D      Thanks for trying anyways :-)

20090128220522AA9q3T9	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	What's the best way to backup your gmail emails?	The makers of gmail designed the system so that you never need to delete an email - but as your inbox grows, it can become a HUGE liability if your account ever becomes compromised.       I'd like to download the current messages and encrypt them onto my own machine - and from there I can delete the online ones through gmail (that way there won't be a massive collection of emails at a thief's disposal.) I was thinking something along the lines of using Mozilla Thunderbid and then using the client to download the emails to a SINGLE .mbox file - and from there I can encrypt it using TrueCrypt. I'd just like to know the method as I believe POP3 needs to be enabled or something along those lines.

20090128220259AAJXE8t	Computers & Internet;Security	Is there a way to prove I am NOT hacking someone?	I am dealing with an ex with an extremely paranoid mental problem. Since we broke up, he's gotten more and more paranoid to the point that he gets out of control for random stuff I'm not doing. His computer freezes, and he says I hacked him. But I didn't! Then he got locked out of some of his accounts, I think people just reported him for all his abuse (he's quite a nut.) But he thinks I hacked his accounts. I most certainly didn't once he convinces myself I am the evil one behind these things, he comes after me and scares the crap out of me, and threatens me, and posts personal pictures and things about my family and gets out of control. I have two questions.      1. How does one talk to an extremely paranoid person?   2. Is there any way to PROVE I'm no doing all these things? could my ISP perhaps offer proof? Are there any kind of records from my isp or computer or SOMETHING that could prove I didn't do these things?

Currently I've got a laptop connected wirelessly to the router, that is bridging its wireless and Ethernet ports, and the Ethernet cable goes around a corner to a switch, and thereby to wired computers. Besides manually assigning the IP addresses, the connection works for general connectivity, but the laptop isn't mine, and would not want to have to rely on a laptop for the other computers internet connection.       USB wireless adapters for the wired computers are out, the wired computers are not in a position for a strong reliable wireless connection, tried with several different adapters, netgear etc.

YouTube is now in widescreen, but you probably know that already. When uploading future videos, should I leave them in their origional 3:2 aspect ratio or squeeze the video into a 16:9 aspect ratio? The advantage would be a video that fills the video player. The disadvantage would be a video that looks flattened.      Should I stretch it? Yes or no?

I have been with a company for 6 months and I recently had my Salary Review...  In writing on every detail of my job I got A+++, praise with the general theme being I outperform and exceed all expectations.    Then for my salary increase it was considerably less than I had anticipated.  I did not agree to the increase I just got a letter telling me what I got.  I'm not sure how to go about asking my Manager for a sit down to discuss the matter.  Should I email him?  Go into his office and tell him straight up?  What should I say when we do meet?  Do I bring in proof of the industry?  Help! I've never done it before ;)

20090128225439AA7mFfb	Computers & Internet;Security	How can I remove these fraud antivirus2009 stuff?	Today I started having problems with my AVG 8.0 in that the Update Manager keep failing. I got Spywaredoctor because I used it before to remove viruses then I just got rid of the Spywaredoctor too, but now I have to register in order to do anything with it. Spywaredoctor detected RogueAntiSpyware.AntiVirusPro (23 infections). Definition says it is also known has Downloader.Win32XpAntivirus.cFraudTool.W... A few months ago I had gotten a false virus warning from AntiVirus2009, and like a dumbaz, I took the fake warning's advice and uploaded AntiVirus2009. But I successfully removed it. Now I guess I somehow activated it again. Heeeelp, any helpful tips or know how to get this outta here and get things back to normal? Much appreciated. 10p 2 da best!

What!? Another user? No-one but me uses it, except the occasional friend which wasn't what happened today! And why'd it say it was already running, I didn't have it running.       Update Manager fails, so I hit update, then it works for a bit, but b4 long I get the whole fail crap again. AVG detected some spyware cookies or some sorta unwanted cookies, but I think I removed them by deleting my cookies. That hasn't stopped the updater from failing.       Two things in my Resident Shield Detection, one says: Virus found FakeAlert, and the other says: Could be infected JS/Generic. They seemed to state that they came from or are Temporary Internet Files...whatever that means. Normally I would simply move the viruses to the viruse vault and out them there, but it says they were already moved there. Yet, they're not there and when I hit Empty List, it says Unable to empty the list. They are from a few weeks ago though, so I don't know what's the deal with them.      I tried downloading Spywaredoctor, but it says I gotta register to do anything about it.       Sooo, any ideas? Someone been through this b4? Please help. -_-,

I went to: www.************.com/isms/index.html and was not prompted for any credentials.  I used an online creator to make the .htaccess & .htpasswd files.  What am I doing wrong?  Am I missing something?  Is there something else I need to implement into the site?  Also, My site is one of many sites hosted from a server.

20060927074922AAi4dQl	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Are you the master of Cygwin, gcc, and as?	HELP!  I am using somebody's hacked version of Cygwin to cross-compile something.  I installed something yesterday and I think it broke my environment (which was compiling OK).  Uninstall appears to have not reset things.      gcc calls as, but cannot find it.  I get an odd error.  Suppose I "gcc foo.c".  I will get an error from as about foo.o having "bfd assertion fail".  When I saw this in the past, it was because of cross-compile issues.  But this time, foo.o does not exist.  I notice that the error message is prefixed with the name of the exe file, which looks kinda like this:   C:\one\two\three/../../suddenly/slashe...   If you parse the \ and / correctly, the as.exe file is there, but can this be right?      What environment vars could possibly change that would cause gcc or as to suddenly not work?  I check the usual suspects like include and lib...and find nothing unusual.      Any help is appreciated...can add details upon request.  Compiling mips-elf code on a PC.  Thx

20090128234542AAy64SK	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Ok Blender fans, here's another one for you (Fluid Animation)....?	I've been following a basic you tube tutorial on fluid simulation. (You can see it here; http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=L-RdmWDaiI... if you feel the need). It's a basic set-up using two cubes the larger as the domain and the smaller set as an inflow.  When baked the result is a constant flow of water from the smaller cube filling the area of the larger one, all simple enough.  The tutorial was built on blender 2.45 and I am using version 2.46.  In my version the physics settings have their own tab but the fluid settings themselves seem to be the same as 2.45.  I've set up my scene as described in the tutorial, the only difference being I added  couple of obstacles for the fluid to hit on the way down. However when I bake the animation instead of getting a constant flow of fluid from the inflow it drops in randomly sized and spaced blobs and splashing everywhere accordingly, producing nothing like the effect I was looking for.  I've watched the tutorial over several time and am sure I'm doing everything right, but I am also aware that the developers are prone to moving, mixing and matching new and old features willy nilly.  Anyone know where I'm going wrong? Is there a surruptitious button lurking in another window that I have failed to activate?    All suggestions much appreciated.    Thanx

20090128233920AAa4zkB	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Should I be Worried About This?	OK, this is a little difficult to explain, but here goes.  I have IE7 and XPsp3.  When IE is open, active, and maximized (it doesn't matter what website I'm at) AND another program is active, not maximized, and in the foreground (i.e. appearing in a small window in front of IE) and I move my mouse outside the "other" program, IE automatically comes to the front without me clicking on it.        It doesn't seem to matter if I mouse-over a linked or non-linked area and this happens far too often (but not every time) for this to be a coincidence (like I know IE comes to the front when a page is done loading, this is not the case here).        Is this a setting?  A virus?  What should I do?  It's odd because it doesn't happen all the time, but often enough to be annoying.

If I leave my computer alone, the temperature gets higher, like in 10 minutes it gets from 50 to 60c. When playing a game, it gets to 90-120c. I was thinking, would 1 or 2 more extra ''refrigerators'' ( or cooling systems fro my gpu ) help ? Because when the temeperature reaches 120, it starts lagging ( when playing a game ofcourse). Would extra cooling systems help, or what would do good also ? Please, thank you.

It asks me if I want to register now or later, and when I click on register now, nothing happens. I think my free trial expired or something. Should I just Unistall McAfee and use a free virus scanner? If so which virus scanner should I use? Windows defender, or something like AVG? Thanks.

20090128214420AA1RrbE	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Computer slowing and heating up?	My HP Pavillion zv6130us, which is almost 5 years old, has become slow (when playing games), and has started having heat problems. I bought a fan dock so that helps most of the time with the heat, but it still doesn't stay as cool as it was.   Should I take it ALL the way apart and see if there is a bunch of dust around the heat sink? Or upgrade?   and if I upgrade, which should I do memory or the HDD? (can only really afford 1, and I guess if I upgrade the memory then I can just check for dust when I set up the second stick... Hmmm)

Every month I just get a load of figures through summarizing who has looked at the site etc. I don't feel like I am getting much for my money.  I have seen gostats.com and they seem to give their clients a lot of info for only $90 a year! Also I am able to go into the admin of my site and update it, amend it myself and do the  google ads the original guy set up, myself too.       The problem is, our website has 8 pages, quite a lot of photos, and the whole admin chunk at the back. I wouldn't call it large but I can't work out how big it is and I've been looking at 123 reg (who I buy my domain name with) and I don't know how many MB web space or data transfer. At the moment I'm afraid to leave this guy, but the contracts only been for a year and I don't think I want to renew. Help!!

20090129032858AAGeMF0	Computers & Internet;Software	Problem downloading Linux KDE via opensuse website?	Hi      Yesterday my college tutor explained to me a little about the operating system Linux, it sounded really interesting and i really wanted to download the live cd from www.opensuse.org, and burn it on a DVD, however the problem i am experiencing is that when i download the file i need for the 64 bit version (yes my computer is definately 64 bit) when it finishes downloading, it does not show up as an ISO file like it should, instead it shows up as being a RAR file, with nothing inside the RAR file that makes any sense to me, (its just for system usage to boot from) i cannot understand this as i have Daemon Tools installed and i have dealt with ISO's many times before and am comfortable with using them but this is one problem i cannot solve.      I also receive the same problem when i try to download the actual intsallation file instead of the live CD, when it downloads it shows up as RAR and not ISO.      I have seen through searching the web that some people who have the same O.S as my desktop computer does (Vista Ultimate) also are having this problem of the ISO showing up as RAR.      I did however just try burning the RAR file to a DVD but of course as i guessed my computer would not boot from that DVD, i did however try downloading the file from opensuse on my Acer laptop and when it finished downloading it did show up as an ISO file on the desktop, so im wondering, and this may sound stupid but im not at home at the moment and so cant check it out but would i be ok to just burn the iso image using my laptop and then boot from that disc on my desktop computer?      Thanks for any help......cant wait to get home and take a look at Linux lol i know im a geek i dont care either lol

My baby is 8 months and I'm still trying to burn footage I put into Windows XP Movie Maker (with audio) onto DVD (yes I have a DVD writer)     I have it as a movie maker file, as a mpg file and as an AVI file (thanks to previous questions asked on YA I have downloaded so many converters)    The issue I need you to help me fix is I need a FREE full program that will allow me to burn /rip (not sure what the difference is in these terms) to a DVD without a watermark or without just a trial (which only lasts a few minutes)    I would be eternally grateful if you gave me a resolution to this problem. The trial version of Nero Vision does not work.
