6SqxGQsqaa	if you have a big backyard then you must throw a party.  but first invite all your closest friends over in the mid afternoon for a nice pre-party party.  have some appetizers, some entrees, and of course dont forget the dessert.  nothing fancy, not a sit down dinner, but your closest friends kicking it on the couch watching tv and eating.  then as night time rolls around you guys can get all dressed up and invite everyone you know to come.  its going to be dark in the backyard so buy or rent a disco ball, get a dj, and just dance! tell everyone to byob, unless you can provide it for them.  desert is always good and some appetizers to just have on the table.|`|vzHmOcoraa	throw a crazy awesome party.....and dance till u cant dance no more|`|sLdhMK7Gaa	Have a nice party!|`|qKjwXiHuaa	I guess it all depends on what you like. <br>  Last year i had a great party.

PKYzSzYxaa	Hi there,<br>    To become a Chef you can go to the CIA - Culinary Institute of America - and receive a Chef certificate.  Or you can go to a State school or a private school with Culinary programs such as  Johnson and Wales or SUNY Delhi.  All three of these schools are great Chef schools - the last two have the advantage of providing you with a Bachelor's degree as well as a Chef certificate.  <br>     The best school, in my mind, is practice.  Buy a knife set (you'll need it for culinary school anyway) or if you have a limited budget, go for  a Chef's knife and a paring knife. <a href="http://www.chefknifecentral.com/category/18464669321/1/Chef-Knives.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.chefknifecentral.com/category...</a>   Then look online for knife skills tutorials.  <br>      This will give you a good glimpse into what it is like to be a chef, as well as give you a big advantage once you get in to chef school.|`|p2G5KJywaa	Try this link.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cookingschoolguide.com/cooking_schools/usa/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cookingschoolguide.com/cookin...</a><br>  <br>  It is a list of cooking schools in the United States by state.<br>  <br>  Get a job in a restaurant until then, in the kitchen. See if you're really interested and cut out for it. It is hard work and requires a lot of time and comittment with little pay to start off.<br>  Tell the owner/manager you want a career as a chef and plan on attending culinary school and are willing to do whatever for now. (ie: washing veggies, prep work, anything training you to cook...no waiting tables) He may see you as a future benefit and help you up the ladder. There's a lot of unemployed chefs out there.<br>  You're young though. That's good, get a start (at the bottom) in a nice place early and stay with it. Go to a good local culinary school, graduate and when you get a break go for it. Good luck|`|cY5dtNvRaa	if you search on google<br>  i am sure you can find some|`|wLgGD63raa	If you are really interested in becoming a chef the school you choose doesn't really matter as there are a good number of steps you have to take after graduating before becoming a certified chef. <br>  <br>  There are many different certifications, you can see a list of them at this website - <a href="http://www.about-culinary-colleges.com/articles/certification-types/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.about-culinary-colleges.com/a...</a><br>  <br>  the National Restaurant Association's (NRA) website has a lot of useful information as well, and can be found here - <a href="http://www.about-culinary-colleges.com/articles/certification-types/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.about-culinary-colleges.com/a...</a><br>  <br>  As well as the NRA there is the Culinary Institute of America (CIA) - <a href="http://www.ciachef.edu/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ciachef.edu/</a><br>  <br>  You may be able to find a good school near you at either one of these websites. But please keep in mind that being a chef is not as glamorous it may seem on TV. It is a very stressful job with a lot of hours of hard work put in, and really does not pay as much money as people think.<br>  <br>  Before you begin attending school make sure this is truly what you want.|`|kTHIZPy5aa	The New England Culinary Institute in Vermont

You could use google to convert those to Celsius if needed.|`|KSK22vHUaa	Depending on their size, they should be completely cooked after 75 minutes at 375 degrees F.  If it's a dry recipe, like not cooking them in a casserole or a gravy, you should cover the pan with a lid or some foil to keep them from drying out on top.  If it's with a gravy, baste them about every 20 minutes, or turn them halfway through.

That would help. Here are a few ideas, though...<br>  <br>  Beans (takes about 15 minutes): Saute an onion in a Tb or so of oil for about 5 minutes, or a crushed garlic clove or two in the oil for about 2 minutes, stirring often (or, better, use both onion and garlic if possible). Add some black pepper, and any (or preferably all!) of these spices: 1/2 tsp of oregano, generous pinch of thyme, 1/4 tsp paprika, 1/2 tsp of cumin. Then add 1.5 Tb tomato paste or a 14oz can of diced tomatoes or a couple of chopped fresh tomatoes. Make sure everything's well mixed. Saute another minute or two. Add a drained can of beans, saving the bean water for later. Stir around a bit, let cook 5 minutes on low heat. Taste check and add salt to taste. Add about half the bean water, and, if you have it, 1/2 tsp balsamic, wine, or rice vinegar. Stir, cook a few more minutes. Eat with rice or tortillas.<br>  <br>  Basic Rice Pilaf (takes about 20 minutes): In a small to medium pot, saute an onion or a couple of garlic cloves in oil for a couple of minutes over medium heat. Add some black pepper, 1/2 tsp dill or 1/2 tsp oregano or 1/2 tsp thyme, or a combination. Add chopped mushrooms or a chopped up red bell pepper or some chopped parsley if you have them and saute 5 minutes more. Or, add some peas (don't saute 5 minutes in this case). Add the quantity of rice you want, making sure it's well coated with the oil. Turn heat to low. Stir the rice around in the oil until it's shiny and starting to look a little bit translucent (3 minutes or so). Add a pinch of salt, to taste. Add vegetable broth (if you have it) or warm water with a veggie boullion cube, or water and a bay leaf or just warm water if that's all you've got. Use enough water so that the water level in your pot reaches enough so that if you lightly touch your index finger to the top of the layer of rice, the water comes up to the first joint of that finger (alternatively, use 1+1/2 times the amount of rice  you used). Cook rice over low heat for 15 minutes. Let rest a few minutes before eating.<br>  <br>  Potatoes (takes about 15 minutes): Fry chopped potatoes with onions, parsley, mushrooms, or red bell pepper. Seasonings that are good with potatoes include: rosemary, cumin, thyme, paprika, and coriander. Potatoes can take a long time to cook; to shorten the time, chop them up into roughly 1/2 inch pieces, coat chopped pieces with oil (preferably olive), and microwave, covered, for 3 minutes. Then fry with whatever ingredients are on hand.

KSK22vHUaa	"Hard anodized" is non-stick and won't flake off like that.  Don't get anything tephlon or anything that's only black on the inside and not also on the outside.  <br>  <br>  Stainless steal is good as well, but you will need to rub just a little cooking oil on the inside to keep things from sticking.  Do this before you cook in them, every time.<br>  <br>  Copper is excellent for keeping the heat even, but it's usually pretty expensive.<br>  <br>  Go to the store and pick the pans up and look at them.  Heavy pots and pans will last longer.  You want something sturdy and heavy.  Be prepared to pay 150-200 dollars minimum for a good set.|`|GhZG2LYDaa	It's time to throw the pan away. Buy your parents a good set like Caphalon available in major retailers.

You don't want it in your food.<br>  <br>  Buy some all stainless steel pots and pans without  coating. If the pans have a copper bottom (not where the copper touches your food), heat is distributed better.<br>  <br>  Costco had some nice pots and pans at one time. That's where we bought our last set.  I don't know if they have any in their warehouse store now.|`|cJRFbZUaaa	Sounds like you were using a Teflon-coated aluminum pan.  Those pans never last.  Cast iron and stainless steel pans last longer and don't have peeling coatings.  They cost more initially but are a better value because they can last for years.
I40vnqNyaa	Cooking spray contains only oil and propellant which is hydrocarbon...  so there isn't any alcohol in it anyway.   Even if it did contain alcohol, any alcohol would be burned off during the cooking process in much the same way wine or brandy is when used in cooking..  The flavour remains but the alcohol is gone..|`|231e2f619695988a9a2770ac10966cd2aa	no. and dont try it. if your that desperate to get drunk, id suggest find some decent alcohol.. <br>  <br>  cooking spray???|`|KNI4xxXaaa	No you cant.   wtf?  dont they have real alcohol where you live?  must be pretty despro if your ready to spray that stuff down ya throat..|`|hwZMijykaa	No

The whisky itself is identical to one you can go buy in a liquor store today.  Because it has spent the last 53 years in a glass bottle instead of a wooden barrel, it has not aged or improved in flavor at all.  This is a common myth, as wine can mellow out a bit in the bottle after it is done barrel aging.  But liquor does not improve in a glass bottle, end of story.  It is the same today as it was in 1956 and the same as a new bottle made today.<br>  <br>  So, if the design of the bottle and label are different than what you can get now it has some value.  Still, its only worth as much as someone will pay for it.  Working against you is the fact Crown Royal is a common brand, and there was no decrease in output for 1956.  If you had, say, a 1942 bottle that would probably have been affected by WW2 so there wouldbe less of them produced, thus driving the price up.|`|0Ye3d4C3aa	the alcohol itself wouldnt be worth more, but since it is crown royal and its an antique it might be worth more to collectors.|`|AA11414292	No its worth what ever was paid for it.<br>  Unless it was a special collectors bottle.|`|39e96e9e3c0bce02422416332ccfeecbaa	no.  spirits do not change in the bottle, so it's exactly the same now as it was then|`|FzWFAt7qaa	I'd look at liquor auctions which would generally contain wine and see if there's any sellers that sell liquor such as yours.

It's not the same as the oestrogen your own body makes though - it is 1,000 times weaker than your own body's oestrogen, but it's this that has led to concerns (and rumour) about oestrogen dependent cancer.<br>  <br>  There are those in the field who argue that isoflavones may be of help in preventing breast cancer or be beneficial to women who have had breast cancer.<br>  <br>  There is current research into whether increasing phyto oestrogens in the diet helps to prevent breast or prostate cancer, and a study in 2002 found that women with the highest levels of soya products in their diets had the lowest breast density - higher breast density being associated with higher breast cancer risk.<br>  <br>  Women with the highest levels of isoflavones in their diet are reported to have significant risk reductions for uterine cancer.|`|bb6f5c98e5ad6a19b9c7b09e398b2418aa	I like soy milk<br>  <br>  I also make muffins with my own home made soy milk<br>  <br>  (soak 1/3 cup of soybeans for 8 hrs<br>  grind in a blender, add around three cups of water<br>  cook until boiling (happens fast, so the pot has to be watched <br>  <br>  only use maybe one half cup of the above soy milk in muffins.|`|7e8f0bbc8244c5d508d162a83549915eaa	Try Hemp milk products instead of Soy

Especially useful for those nights when you cant be bothered.<br>  <br>  I do the same thing with soup in the winter.  I make huge pots of soup like pumpkin and chicken and vegetable, then freeze in bowl size batches for very quick and healthy microwave meals.  Small Gladware containers are great for this as they freeze well and are just the right size.  <br>  <br>  What about some fresh salmon cooked on the bbq.   its healthy, really nice, very quick and almost NO washing up!...  I usually buy the fillets and not the cutlets. I let the salmon come to room temp before cooking so they wont stick, then sprinkle lightly with chilli flakes, spray with a little olive oil spray and then cook on the solid plate. Its as easy as that. Cook presentation side down first, you can see the fish cooking from the side, it goes a lighter colour. When its about half way done turn it over and cook till skin is crispy but still a little opaque in the middle as the fish will continue to cook after you remove it from the heat. place on a plate and loosely cover with foil and allow to rest for half the time it took to cook. Then serve with whatever you wish. Something like a fresh salsa, salad or veggies.  That's it. Delicious. Salmon is one of my all time favourites. Yum!   Throw some asparagus spears that have been tossed in a little olive oil and sprinkled with rosemary on the hotplate while the salmon is cooking as asparagus tastes great char grilled. When you serve your salmon lay a few asparagus spears diagonally across the top. Looks impressive and tastes fantastic.<br>  <br>  for a fast pantry dinner try using tinned salmon or tuna for things like.<br>  <br>  Salmon Fish Cakes:<br>  400g tinned salmon drained, 6 spring onions, 400g potatoes, zest 1 lemon, 1/4 cup parsley, 1/4 cup plain flour, 2 tablespoons oil.<br>  <br>  Combine together and make into balls, should make 8, and set aside covered in fridge to firm up, then cook in a pan.

61a706a96992f304450dbded47628ddbaa	My kids are grown now, but when they were younger and boy..let me tell you we were POOR.  We used powdered milk (dry) for many things. Use less water than then instructions advise and add a little bit of sugar. Place in Frig. for a while before you use it. I must be cold!  Also to save money always use dry milk for cooking. Can't taste the difference at all. Even now that I do have the money to buy milk, if I run out I will use my creamer for my coffee. Just add hot water and boom...MILK for a recipe.

FicyC2TXaa	There is no actual scientific evidence that soya causes, prevents, contributes to or affects the progress of any cancer, including oestrogen positive breast cancer, which is the one most often cited.<br>  <br>  Soya proteins contain isoflavones that can mimic a weak oestrogen effect. It's not the same as the oestrogen your own body makes though - it is 1,000 times weaker than your own body's oestrogen, but it's this that has led to concerns (and rumour) about oestrogen dependent cancer.<br>  <br>  There are those in the field who argue that isoflavones may be of help in preventing breast cancer or be beneficial to women who have had breast cancer.<br>  <br>  There is current research into whether increasing phyto oestrogens in the diet helps to prevent breast or prostate cancer, and a study in 2002 found that women with the highest levels of soya products in their diets had the lowest breast density - higher breast density being associated with higher breast cancer risk.<br>  <br>  Women with the highest levels of isoflavones in their diet are reported to have significant risk reductions for uterine cancer.<br>  <br>  There are concerns about the effect of soya on certain existing thyroid conditions, but I don't have sufficient knowledge to comment on that|`|6Gfz125Paa	You can develop health problems from consuming too much of anything over time, even water if you have enough of it.

(As I stack layers together I stick them with toothpicks to prevent cake from shifting).<br>  6.<br>  To prepare the frosting, place sugar, cream of tartar or corn syrup, salt, water, and egg whites in the top of a double boiler. Beat with a hand-held electric mixer for 1 minute. Place pan over boiling water, being sure that boiling water does not touch the bottom of the top pan. (If this happens, it could cause your frosting to become grainy). Beat constantly on high speed with electric mixer for 7 minutes. Beat in vanilla. Frost the sides of the cake first, being careful not to get crumbs in the icing. When cake is completely covered, gently cover frosting with coconut.<br>  7.<br>  Cover loosely and refrigerate for three days (if you can stand it that long!).

However, it should be kept in mind that anything that is not done in moderation is bad for you.|`|D6NBfSVoaa	It is bad, and it's also addicting.|`|Y1LTzXataa	It enhances the flavour of foods. However, some people have a very severe reaction to it, which can be dangerous.

It is a salt made with glutamic acid -- which is a non-essential amino acid. MSG was not isolated until 1900 something, but before then it was present in many Asian dishes as a seaweed extract. Today, it is produced as a fermentation of the carbohydrates of beets, sugar cane, or molasses. <br>  <br>  Based on this background info, MSG doesn't seem to be as bad as everybody says. It seems as though some people have adverse reactions to it, but that can be expected of anything. Studies of this have not been found to be statistically significant. <br>  <br>  If you don't feel sick after eating MSG, then I wouldn't worry much about consuming it. It is a salt, however, so you should obviously not over do it. I think that because MSG enhances flavors, it makes foods more desirable, and encourages people to eat more than they normally would. For this reason, I would watch myself when eating foods containing MSG to make sure I am not over indulging.|`|QhO7jIkDaa	It makes some kids really hyper and some can get extremely out of control (I've seen it happen to a LOT of kids) but I have a different reaction it makes me over heat and my arms get extremely itchy!

It would be almost impossible to check every product to make sure their sugar is from a company that doesn't use bone char.

Some countries have outlawed its use.   I do make sure that the sugar I occasionally use at home is not made with the use of  bone char filters though.   The easiest way to make sure you're not getting bone char sugar at home in the U.S.  is to buy organic sugar.

DFshzoJkaa	i think its great that you decided to stay away from soda!!  people have no idea how bad it really is.  especially diet sodas.  they have so many chemicals in them.<br>  <br>  anyway, take about 1/2 cup of juice, (either pommegranate, grape, oj or whatever you like), and add 2 or 3 cups of seltzer water.  its nutritious and low in calories.  the good thing about seltzer water is it has no sodium or chemicals.  because juice can be so sweet, mixing such a small amount with seltzer will make it more tasty and refreshing.  another drink would be green tea (high in antioxidents, which is very good for you) with a little honey in it.  or fresh lemonade, with a little maple syrup in it.  keep in mind that sweetners like honey and maple syrup are natural sweetners and are much better for you than the sugar thats in soda (which is high fructose corn syrup), so dont be afraid to add a little honey or maple syrup to you beverages.  another beverage would be soy milk (unsweetened).<br>  <br>  dont drink crystal light!!!  it has tons of chemicals in it!!!|`|v9vrH4Exaa	You could drink some Lipton Green tea if you want.<br>  It tastes good and is also good for you; lots of antioxidants!<br>  Grape juice happens to be my favorite, so I'll have to suggest it.<br>  Oh, and try Vitamin water. You might like that too.|`|SU6AP3t5aa	you can make kool aid and cut  back on how much sugar you add|`|bd7388851727f8e5810b81c40752ffb1aa	Water.

I drink water with lemon almost always, and I don't add sugar but you could add a little sugar or honey if you want it a little sweet. Most fruit juices are healthy for you but they do contain natural sugars.  My daughter always waters down the fruit juices for the kids so it's not so sweet and high calorie.
dc5579dda31633fb3c2d8612ff7583cdaa	The easiest thing you can do to eat healthy and prepare healthy meals is to cut out most foods that are packaged and contain preservatives. (examples: soups, macaroni, flavored oatmeal)  Stick with fresh or frozen fruits and veggies. If you prefer canned veggies get them either no salt added or low sodium. With canned fruits get the ones packaged with their own juice or water not heavy syrup. Limit sodas and sugar drinks (even fruit juice contains tons of sugar). Choose whole wheat breads, pastas, tortillas. Eat the leanest pieces of meat and the size of your fist. Drink 2%, 1% or skim milk instead of whole milk. Brown rice over white rice. Low fat yogurt, pretzels instead of chips. Popcorn also instead of chips. Just eat a cup at a time and put the rest in zip lock bags. <br>  You can do a chicken stir fry with tons of veggies<br>  CHICKEN AND VEGETABLE STIR FRY   <br>  <br>  1 yellow pepper<br>  1 or 2 large carrots, chopped<br>  2 boneless and skinless chicken breast, cut into chunks<br>  3 cups rice<br>  1 1/2 of Yoshida's gourmet sauce or worcestershire sauce<br>  1 cup onion cut into strips.<br>  <br>  Start rice first. Use a rice cooker for best results, following the manufacturer's directions. While the rice is cooking, it is best to do all the chopping and preparation.<br>  When preparation is done, in a large Wok or frying pan, combine the pepper, carrot, chicken, sauce and the onions.<br>  <br>  Let this cook for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Don't let it cook too long; check your vegetable to see that they are still crunchy. Serve when chicken is done!<br>   <br>  Black Bean chili<br>  Ingredients: <br>  1 medium onion chopped <br>  1 medium green bell pepper diced about ? inch pieces <br>  1 TBS + 1-1/2 cups vegetable broth <br>  6 medium cloves garlic, chopped <br>  2 cans (15 oz each) black beans, drained <br>  1 can (8 oz) tomato sauce <br>  1 can (15 oz) diced tomatoes, (do not drain) <br>  2 TBS ground cumin <br>  2 TBS red chili powder <br>  2 TBS dried oregano <br>  1 cup corn kernels, fresh or frozen <br>  ? cup fresh chopped cilantro <br>  salt & black pepper to taste <br>   <br>  <br>  Directions: <br>  <br>  Heat 1 TBS broth in a medium size soup pot. Healthy Sauté onion and bell pepper in broth over medium heat for about 5 minutes stirring frequently, until translucent. Add garlic, cumin, red chili powder and continue to sauté for another minute. <br>  Add 1 ? cups broth and rest of ingredients, except cilantro and corn. Simmer for another 20 minutes uncovered. Add corn and cook for another 2 minutes. Add chopped cilantro and season with salt & pepper to taste. <br>  Serves 4 <br>  <br>  <br>  Prep and Cook Time: 10 minutes <br>  <br>  <br>  Romaine & Avocado Salad<br>  Ingredients: <br>  1 large head romaine lettuce, outside leaves discarded <br>  1 large tomato chopped <br>  1 small red bell pepper cut in thin julienne, 1 inch long <br>  1/2 small avocado cut into chunks <br>  *Optional: 2 TBS coarsely chopped walnuts <br>  Dressing <br>  2 TBS lemon juice <br>  2 tsp balsamic vinegar <br>  extra virgin olive oil to taste <br>  Salt and cracked black pepper to taste <br>   <br>  <br>  Directions: <br>  <br>  Remove outer leaves of lettuce heads and discard. Cut off tops of leaves and discard. Tops are bitter. Chop remaining inner leaves. Rinse in cold water, and if you have a salad spinner, spin lettuce to dry. If you don't have one, remove as much water as possible in a colander and then dry with paper towels. This will keep the flavor of the salad from getting diluted. <br>  Whisk together lemon juice, vinegar, olive oil, salt and pepper in a small bowl and toss with salad greens. Sprinkle with chopped walnuts if desired. <br>  Serves 4|`|CDM8yvmCaa	lots of veges!!! And fruit. It's sooo simple.

aNlT1NRqaa	First, check to see if it will pump out steam without a ton of water. If it doesn't, don't use it.<br>  <br>  Now, skim milk is terrible for it, the bubbles are too dry and flavorless. Use 2% milk or half-and-half. It should be cold (very cold). I put mine in the freezer in a steel frothing container for 5-10 minutes before use. Just barely submerge the wand (about .25") and turn on the pressure. It should sound like tearing paper (not like blowing bubbles through a straw). Do this until volume increases to around double (if you have a frothing thermometer, it should be around 100 degrees F). Now submerge the wand farther and tilt the cup to create swirling (this is called stretching & sweetens the milk). This should be done until the temperature is around 140-160 degrees F. Done.<br>  <br>  If your machine is no good for steam, there's another way: Put milk into a steel cooking pot (I use a saucier for large groups) and put it in the freezer. When very cold (ice forming) put on stove. Whisk briskly while heating up on medium-high. It will create fine foam & stretch the milk at the same time. The bubbles will start big, but become finer as time goes by. I test by stocking my finger in & going until it feels nearly scalding & remove from heat. Just use a ladle for he milk & a spoon for the foam.<br>  <br>  The machine probably doesn't put out enough pressure for great espresso (most under $1000 don't). If it doesn't create a good crema "foam", and you don't want to spend the money, try a Bialetti stovetop moka pot. as close as you can get to real espresso for under $100.|`|EMDNVrcjaa	I find I like to heat my milk before I froth it because I like it really hot. Anyway, I heat it up, then I put the frother tip just barely under the surface of the milk and turn on the frother until it gets to the foaminess I want. I'm not sure if this is what you want, or if you need to know which buttons to use, hope this helps.|`|dOOeNqgyaa	Follow the instructions of an electrical frother as shown is this site:<br>  <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/coffee-stovetops" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/coffee-stovetops</a>

You can even go to the grocery store and buy FAKE meat, which is made mostly with ground up veggies and soy products.<br>  <br>  When you think about all of the different foods in the world, being vegan really doesn't put a limitation on what you can eat because there are soo many alternatives.<br>  <br>  If I list everything you can eat I will be here all night haha so I'll just list a few..<br>  <br>  soups<br>  salads<br>  tacos (with veggie ground/fake beef)<br>  salads<br>  soy yogurt<br>  oatmeal with dried fruit <br>  cereal & soy milk<br>  stir fry<br>  rice<br>  tofu<br>  <br>  the list goes on and on!<br>  <br>  Good luck on your project!|`|T32hOtKtaa	vegan hohos.

Most grocery stores carry an array of great-tasting vegan options. Many products, including fantastic faux franks, veggie burgers, chicken-free chicken patties, flavored soy milks, nondairy ice creams, and other sensational soy-based snacks, are marketed to vegetarians and vegans. There's also an abundance of chips, dips, cookies, candies, frozen pies, soups, and other mouth-watering items by mainstream food manufacturers that are also vegan. <br>  <br>  Take a stroll through your local grocery store, check some ingredients, and you'll see what we mean. You may even be surprised to find that a few of your favorite indulgences happen to be vegan! For example, did you know that Pepperidge Farm Turnovers, Murray Butter Cookies, and Cracker Jacks are all vegan? They may not all be "health foods," but they are great for the taste buds! Just remember, one cannot live on Goldenberg Peanut Chews alone. <br>  <br>  Click above to see some vegan options for everything from soups to snacks.<br>  <br>  There is also an abundance of chips, dips, cookies, candies, frozen pies, soups, and other mouth-watering items by mainstream food manufacturers that are also vegan.*<br>  <br>  We are constantly updating this list, so if you know of a vegan product that isn't currently listed here or if you find a product here that isn't vegan, please contact PETA. <br>  <br>  Thank you, and happy munching!|`|voDpSabcaa	Don't eat any meat,animal or dairy products so no animals or anything that comes from animals.

Mozzarella actually freezes much better than some other types of cheese, so it may well be perfectly useful for cooking after freezing, although the texture will probably be somewhat more crumbly and mealy than in the fresh state.|`|28hFhC58aa	You can but I would not suggest it.  All block cheese, when frozen, will crumble when thawed out.  In fact, instead of buying expensive shredded cheese, you can freeze a block of cheese, then thaw it out and it will crumble.

Hope you enjoy..<br>  <br>   whole (4 to 5 pound) duck<br>  1 tablespoon Chinese five-spice powder<br>  2 teaspoons sugar<br>  2 teaspoons salt<br>  5 big slices fresh ginger<br>  4 garlic cloves<br>  1/2 bunch green onions<br>  1 tangerine,peel cut in big strips<br>  1/4 cup rice vinegar<br>  1/2 cup honey<br>  1/2 cup soy sauce<br>  <br>  Directions<br>  Duck is notoriously a fatty bird, to diminish the fat and produce a crispy skin, begin by trimming the excess fat from the neck and body. Rinse the duck, inside and out, and pat dry thoroughly with paper towels. Combine the Chinese five-spice, sugar, and salt in a small bowl. Rub the spice mixture all over the duck, inside and out. Salt and five-spice powder makes a fragrant dry marinade, which draws some of the moisture from the duck so that the spices penetrate. Stuff the duck cavity with the aromatics: the ginger, garlic, green onions, and tangerine peel. Fold the wing tips back under the duck and tie the legs together with kitchen string. Poke the duck breast a few times, piercing the skin.<br>  <br>  Place a roasting pan on the stovetop over 2 burners and fill with 2-inches of water, turn the heat to medium. Set a V-rack insert inside the pan and lay the duck on the rack, breast-side up. Cover tightly with aluminum foil. Steam the duck for 45 minutes, checking the water level periodically. Steaming the duck first melts away some of the fat and shrinks the skin.<br>  <br>  In a small saucepan combine the vinegar, honey, and soy sauce over low heat. Cook and stir for 5 minutes until thick. The duck will be lacquered with the sweet glaze, which caramelizes during roasting, making the skin crisp and brown.<br>  <br>  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.<br>  <br>  Take the foil off the duck, remove the rack with the duck, and pour out the water and all the fat that has rendered out (this is great to use in other dishes like fried rice.) Put the rack with the duck back inside the roasting pan. Baste the duck with the vinegar mixture, until all the skin is completely coated in the glaze. Stick the whole thing in the oven. Roast the duck for 1 hour, basting periodically with any remaining glaze to set in a deep mahogany color. Tent the breast with some foil if it gets too dark. The legs will wiggle easily when it's done. Carve and serve.|`|b121e2f7b2d398c44662e6d1126ba9d6aa	gosh too bad you have a duck and not a goose. Duck and yak ball do not go well together at all.

Q5BM2POnaa	You don't unless you're a gringo college kid.<br>  <br>  Real tequila afficianados migh enjoy their tequila with a squeeze of lime, but more often than not, it's sipped (not shot) straight.<br>  <br>  Salt, sucking limes and margaritas (not that there is anything wrong with a nice margarita) are all American inventions.<br>  <br>  As a couple of others mentioned, you don't want to cover the taste of "good" tequila.  What everyone failed to mention is exactly what "good" tequila is.<br>  <br>  Let's start with a basic review.<br>  <br>  The first step is to buy a bottle of tequila that says 100% agave. Ones that are not 100% (like most types of Cuervo and Sauza) are only 51% agave. The remaining 49% is grain alcohol, fillers and corn sweeteners, all of which degrade the flavor and make the hangover worse.<br>  <br>  The next step is to think about the aging, as that has a lot to do with the flavor and the price:<br>  <br>  Blanco (because it's totally clear) - no aging. Sometimes called silver or white.<br>  <br>  Reposado - minimally aged at least 2 months, but can be up to 1 year. Sometimes called gold.<br>  <br>  Anejo - heavily aged, minimally 1 year but less than 3 years.<br>  <br>  Generally speaking, the longer the aging, the darker the color, the smoother the flavor and the more expensive. Do look out for junk like Cuervo Black which uses caramel coloring (sugar basically) to darken rathing than traditional methods.<br>  <br>  Then consider how you're going to drink it.<br>  <br>  Slammed shots - go for a blanco. Anything else is a waste of flavor and $$<br>  <br>  Sipped shots (how I recommend it) - with no salt and a squeeze of lime. Chilled or on the rocks is good as is straight for reposados but straight is best for anejos.<br>  <br>  Margarita - anejo is a waste, especially if the place isn't using fresh squeezed lime juice. Go for blanco or reposado.<br>  <br>  Personally, I like the following tequilas:<br>  <br>  Cazadores <br>  Herradura <br>  Don Julio<br>  Corzo (please note this is not Cuervo)<br>  Pura Sangre<br>  Centinela<br>  Cabo Wabo<br>  Arette<br>  Dos Lunas|`|0NkrNStxaa	to get the gross tequila taste outa your mouth!|`|2oYo4krQaa	It's the tourista way.  You don't have to do it.  I believe that that salt and lime were to disguise the flavor of inferior tequila, so if you have a quality one, don't add anything.  Just sip and savor.|`|l7GjBVvhaa	"Mexicans have long known that a little sodium chloride on the tongue can help to mollify the fiery flavor that characterizes much of their food. They use salt when downing chile peppers, for example. By the same token, citrus juices of various kinds have long been used to kill the aftertaste of the more potent forms of alcohol. For example, poor black folks in the U.S. used to cut their port wine with lemon juice. The Gallo wine company noticed this and began marketing Thunderbird, a white port-citric acid mixture. Anyway, when tequila came to the U.S., the salt and lime (or lemon) bit came with it." <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Be seeing you..........|`|39e96e9e3c0bce02422416332ccfeecbaa	you don't.  you should only do it for the crappy tequilas anyways, otherwise you lose a lot of the flavor|`|wX3P9Tlcaa	you don't have to ,it's a chaser.|`|4coUbchGaa	Interesting.<br>  <br>  Good tequila is never drunk with lime and salt for starters. Now that I have that out of the way lets progress..<br>  <br>  In the 1930s there was an epidemic of Spanish influenza in Mexico and this lead to doctors prescribing the medicine we all dream of, which was of course Tequila w/ Lemon and Salt. It was said at the time that this would enable the tequila to be absorbed more rapidly into the body and improve the "cure".<br>  <br>  This method is known as "tequila cruda".<br>  <br>  In reality though the salt reduces the so called "burn" associated with cheap non-100% agave tequila. It is more commonly used as a marketing gimmick.<br>  <br>  My thought.... if the tequila is so bad you need to firstly hide the taste (with the salt) then drown it out (with the lemon/lime) why on earth are you buying and drinking it?|`|so9M313daa	You don't have to. It just "rounds off" the taste of the whole thing.

That will help stimulate your appetite and the sweetness will make it easier on a nauseated tummy.<br>  <br>  edit:  apples are high in fiber, so they make you feel fuller.  they also require more chewing than many other foods, which means they may take longer to eat and give you more time to realize that you are no longer hunger.  they do not, however, suppress appetites in any magical way.  if you feel nauseated because you haven't eaten, it will actually stimulate your appetite because you will still be hungry.  this isn't a case of having the munchies.  the questioner has clearly only had a few hundred calories at most.|`|u93oneUXaa	An apple supresses your appetite - it does not stimulate it so don't listen to that person -- and EAT actual food unless you want to die.|`|jZRtTpZiaa	You can't be serious.

Q4oPyclQaa	I think you need to ask this in a different section.  For some reason Yahoo Answers picked the cooking section for you (probably because of the word "cod").  Next time you ask the question please check the section that Y!A has selected for you.  You want to switch it to something related to computers instead of the cooking section.  Nobody here will probably know the answer.

Yes, it is tender, but any properly cooked steak can be.  If you don't have a grill, add a teaspoon or two of liquid smoke to your marinade.  The longer you marinate, the more tender it will be.  Be sure to pierce the meat so the flavor is absorbed.  Bring the meat to room temperature before cooking it.  Your best bet is to get a good quality steak, and sear it on both sides, and then reduce the heat and cook to desired donenesss.  Searing locks the moisture inside the meat.  The link below will help you cook the steak well. <br>  <br>  As for the rest of the meal-it doesn't have to be anything super fancy for a man to enjoy himself.  Garlic mashed potatoes, steamed green beans with slivered toasted almonds, cheesecake, and a beer will make just about any man happy.  <br>  <br>  Garlic Mashed Potatoes:<br>  Quarter 3 lbs of red potatoes, and cook in boiling water (seasoned with salt) until you can pick them up with a fork (15 minutes or so).<br>  <br>  Drain, and put in bowl.  Add 8 oz cream cheese, salt and pepper, and 2-3 cloves roasted garlic OR 3/4 tsp of garlic powder, milk until smooth.  If it's too sticky, add milk 1 tb at a time.<br>  <br>  Green Beans-<br>  <br>  Buy the fresh steam-in-the-bag green beans in your produce section.  Cook according to package directions, put in bowl, top with a touch of salt and pepper, and a pat of butter.

4d80afe3510fcec9f8c8cce72cafd379aa	Call some local bakeries.  Your area will determine pricing.  Cake prices have a wide range.  Also, it would depend on how many servings you want the cake for.  It's fondant covered so it will be a bit more expensive than a buttercream frosted cake.  The decorations probably wouldn't add extra because they're fairly simple.  It looks like it probably serves about 100.  So if you just need a rough estimate, I'd call it 350-400 dollars, maybe more.  If you need an actual amount, call around for an estimate on a fondant covered cake with simple cutout decorations and have an idea of how many servings you'd want to have.  Most weddings have 100-150 guests so that's probably a good place to start.|`|vvoz2jeyaa	you can not tell how big the cake is in the picture but if that cake were to feed 100 people it would cost around $650 to $750 as my best guess.

How to make the perfect chai and then sip (note sip, not drink!) it in peace.<br>  <br>  The Perfect Chai:<br>  <br>  1. For each cup, of chai u need about 4/5 th cup of water, u are going to lose some water in evaporation etc.. and u are going to add milk for the rest. This measure can be changed to suit your proportion of tea+milk.<br>  <br>  2. Boil the water and then pour it into the tea pot. Now ad the tea leaves, I use about 1 teaspoon/cup.<br>  <br>  3. Now close the pot, and if u want to preserve the heat, close it with a sort of insulating cap u get for the pot.<br>  <br>  4. Now heat some milk separately.<br>  <br>  5. The cups can be pre-heated by rinsing with hot water.<br>  <br>  6. After the tea has brewed for 7-10 minutes, pour the tea into the cups through a strainer, add milk + sugar.<br>  <br>  Modified Chai (doesn't need pot etc..)<br>  <br>  1. Boil the water in a regular vessel<br>  <br>  2. Turn off the gas, add chai and close the vessel with a plate so that the steam stays in<br>  <br>  3. Other steps are same<br>  <br>  Ginger+Ilaichi chai:<br>  <br>  1. Cut some pieces of ginger, crush them with a spoon. Add it to the water when u boil it. U can also add Ilaichi (cardamom ) to add flavor.<br>  <br>  U can try various types of tea. The best is got by mixing the so called dust tea and leaf tea. Dust adds strength, while leaf gives a distinctive flavor to it. Try Darjeeling tea, its great.<br>  <br>  And remember tea should never be boiled, it should be brewed.|`|gw30AoiDaa	<a href="http://www.chai-tea.org/rec/rec103.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.chai-tea.org/rec/rec103.html</a>|`|HN693GiNaa	you can get great chai recipes from the internet- but I always recommend a dash of vanilla, which is my own little addition to the brew...yum!

(Warm pink middle)  Bake potato in oven, (maybe sour cream and chive as a choice) a nice tossed salad and warm crusty bread. <br>  <br>  No recipe needed. Just buy the salad pre-made, offer other veggies in small serving dishes. Store bought dressings. Bake the potato, broil or grill the steak to his liking. Maybe a nice red wine if he(or you) like and BAM!  He is smiling. So many make pasta...women like pasta more than men. If your man likes meat, feed him meat!

Beat on low speed for 2 minutes or stir by hand for 3 minutes. Pour into greased 13x9 baking pan. Bake at 350 for 30-35minutes or until a toothpick inserted near center comes out clean. Cool completely on wire rack.  In a mixing bowl, combine the whipped topping mix and renaming root beer. Beat until soft peaks form. Frost cake and place in refrigerator for 1 hour. <br>  <br>  You can use round pans if you like, same recipe just split in half when you pour the mix.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and enjoy the sweet love after : )<br>  <br>  Worked for me! 19 years!|`|uetqUAEvaa	I am making mine a pot roast dinner (In the crockpot).

Instead, buy a couple of really good steaks and grill them.  (A really good steak has marbled fat in it).  Toss a couple of potatoes in the oven and serve it all with a good red wine, if you drink wine, or a good beer if you don't.  It's simple and not too time-consuming yet tastes great.  If you have to get fancy, try Steak au Poivre.  It's not hard and doesn't take too long.

ec2dc5211c53f8480f101ad72a7e1eb4aa	Calphalon Contemporary Nonstick or Stainless TriPly is an excellent choice for a registry. It is pretty, heavy gauge, and has a lifetime warrantee. It is also carried by macy's and BBB. <br>  <br>  I would suggest registering for the set AND the open stock. AND register for the same things in both places. It doubles your chances of getting an entire set. If you get doubles, exchange them for other items. <br>  <br>  Target's version of Calphalon is not nearly the same quality. So skip cookware there. Personally, I have a huge attachment to BBB. I registered there, and they were by FAR the best. They were the most organized and had a mind blowingly easy return policy. Just TRY returning stuff at Target and you will instantly regret it. They cut you off after 6 returns even WITH a gift receipt, and they always give you less than your friend paid. UGH.|`|vvoz2jeyaa	if you want something that will last forever then go with cast iron it may be heavy but its advantages far outweigh the disadvantages.

I think it's about $350 for the starter set and you can add single pieces as well.  It's like cooking with cast iron.  You can't use metal spoons or spatulas with it.  So register for some wood utensils as well.  I love my circulon.  <br>  <br>  All Clad is REALLY expensive.  I bought my sister in law one small fry pan (no lid) for $100.  Calphalon is ...eh...ok, but not as good as Circulon, in my book.<br>  <br>  For baking, I would get the clear glass dishes like pyrex.  They come in all sizes and shapes.

Just put it on your defrost setting of your microwave.  You just enter in the weight of your meat and it'll time it for you (at least mine does).  Remember to flip it though so it defrosts evenly.<br>  <br>  If it cooks a little, just go ahead and brown it.  It doesn't change the flavor of your meat.|`|gw30AoiDaa	yes you can defrost it in the microwave and it's ok if it starts to cook a little bit, you still can finish the cooking in the frying pan.|`|zSpDRQ4Faa	you can but i do not recommend it, i recommend to leave under refridgeration (Safest), or to put in a pot under running warm water (fastest way to defrost)|`|zRPcKJlSaa	Yes you sure kan and even if you let it defrost a little too long it's ok to kook in a frypan.

Una vida dura para él y su noble caballo. El 'carrettiere', un hombre joven y guapo, azote en la mano, forzudo, gritón, entonador de canciones y melodías populares. Vestía un traje de terciopelo negro o marrón a rayas, chaleco abotonado con cuatro bolsillitos, un pa?uelo rojo atado al cuello, zapatos pesados con clavos, y la característica gorra negra, "a coppula". Generalmente viajaba con perro. Se ponía en marcha antes de la salida del sol, casi de noche, previa una oración para su seguridad  adelante de una imagen pintada en su carreta. Algunos lo ha visto cruzando en la espalda una efectiva 'lupara', la mejor de las disuasiones contra  los viejo piratas del camino. Cargaba también todo para el fiel caballo, agua, comida y un buen "fiasco" de vino tinto "sangue siciliano", para el mismo, por acaso su garganta se resecara entre las polvorientas y áridas callejuelas. <br>  El "carretto", ornamentado con lo mejor, también servía como medio para el esparcimiento del domingo, con toda la familia, para aprovechar la campi?a con un buen asado a la siciliana, sí, el 'carrettiere' hacía asado de carne. O algún otro evento festivo. <br>  La receta de arriba, la de hoy, la que ostentan muchos establecimientos, no tiene nada que ver con el espíritu del necesitado y casi gaucho 'carrettiere'.  <br>  <br>  Los espaguetis a la carrettiera del 'carrettiere' eran y son en alguna localidad de Sicilia algo más sencillo y fácil de hacer...<br>  Ingredientes<br>   <br>  500 gramos de espaguetis, 2 ó 3 dientes de ajo, aceite de oliva, sal, pimienta, queso pecorino rallado.<br>  Preparación <br>   <br>  Hervir los espaguetis en abundante agua con una cucharada de sal gruesa y colarlos al dente dejándolos con un poco de agua de la cocción. Repartirlos en los platos playos de los comensales, y directamente, condimentarlos con aceite de oliva a gusto y pimienta.

Todo es cuestión de brazo: haz gimnasia con unas pesas unos días antes. Es broma. <br>  Cueces las pastas al dente (mejor: spaghetinnis del 3, ?ok? estarán enseguida) las retiras, dejando que se recoja parte del caldo (le pones debajo el cazo donde han hervido, después de escurrirlas) , Fríes en una sartén grande tiritas de beicon ahumado  en abundante aceite, a fuego medianito . En cuanto que tomen color, echas en esta sartén toda la pasta y parte del caldo ( como tres o cuatro cucharadas), bajas aún más el fuego y lo revuelves bien. Cuando todo esté otra vez sólo caliente, cascas dos huevos (o tres, si te gustan mucho) y ahora , con un tenedor de palo, empiezas a revolver como una loca y a toda velocidad (la idea es que hagas pasta entreverada de huevos revueltos con beicon micronizados ...)  Sube el fuego un poquito justo al final. Un golpe sólo. para "secar". Te tiene que quedar todo bien sueltecito (es un crimen culinario echarle nata... Pezzoni dixit) Sirves a la mesa y rallas entonces encima un poquito de nuez moscada... y queso a discreción.  Esta "salsa" o este ali?o para pastas es definitivo. Si intervienen ni?os en el tema (les encanta) , separa su ración antes de echar la nuez.

Sin duda es la que mejor me queda.<br>  <br>  En una olla agregas un chorrito de aceite vegetal, lo pones a calentar al fuego muy suave. Picas cebolla muy pero muy finita, rallas una zanahoria y agregas cebolla y zanahoria a este aceite. Agregas sal a gusto, una hoja de laurel y dejas que se sofría. Después cuando veas que los pedacitos de cebolla se estan poniendo transparentes le agregas una bandeja de carne molida (en realidad la cantidad de carne molida depende de cuantos tallarines vayas a hacer o de cuantas personas sean las que hayas invitado a comer) bueno, como te decía.. le agregas la carne y un diente de ajo y tapas la olla.. así dejas que la carne se cocine y cada cierto tiempo, la revuelves. Cuando veas que ya está lista le agregas una cajita de salsa de tomates natural, si se te hace muy poco o muy espesa, le agregas dos cajitas de salsa de tomates, esperas a que hierva, le agregas azúcar para quitarle la acidez a la salsa y vuelves a dejarla hervir, una vez hervida, le agregas nuevamente sal a gusto. Y lista para vaciar a la pasta.<br>  Mmmm Como sugerencia puedes agregarle a la salsa un chorrito de vino blanco. Le da un sabor especial y si deseas suavizarla, puedes agregarle dos cucharadas grandes de crema espesa. Te quedará de lujo. Son algunas variantes.

efb7408de37b7178b15ff68701f0a3dbaa	Me fascina, soy chocoadicta, y me gusta en todas sus presentaciones. Pero lo que está mas de moda aquí en Venezuela, es que ahora en todas las fiestas (matrimonios, 15 a?os, graduaciones, etc.) haya una fuente de chocolate, que no se si la hagan en otros países. Casi que te puedes ba?ar en el chocolate, comer todo el que quieras, y nadie te va a criticar ni a decir nada, porque todos están haciendo exactamente lo mismo! Imaginate que a la gente se le olvida el resto de la comida y la bebida de la fiesta, porque todo el mundo está pendiente, como ni?o peque?o, de comer todo el chocolate posible. saludos!|`|047863729908deab3f6cbc45886835a0aa	me encanta, es mas me gusta tanto que puede ser casi de cualquier forma, es maravilloso mmm|`|0c55e3d9368de527e7aa56de7d6c4e99aa	.<br>  <br>  <br>  Chocolate en barra con almendras peque?as.<br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|0ce8ea32e391ba7b6d8e037d4826cfc2aa	El chocolate que más me gusta es el Lindor, el que se vende en formato bombón (bolitas).

aa2c03c6facd20604ab65efa881761d1aa	Hola!<br>  <br>  La carne de venado requiere de maduración antes de cocinarla, para que esté en su punto óptimo. Lo recomendable es ponerla a macerar la noche anterior con vino tinto, hojas de laurel, cebolla y ajo, en un recipiente que debes dejar fuera de la nevera (ojo: no agregar sal).<br>  <br>  Una vez marinada, puedes tomar trozos de la carne (cubos), enharinarlos y luego dorarlos en una mezcla de aceite y mantequilla. Luego los cocinas en una salsa ligera y donde predominen los sabores dulces y especiados. Mi recomendación: <br>  <br>  Sofríe cebolla cortada menuda en mantequilla, agrega unas hojas de tomillo fresco o salvia, agrega el vino de la marinación y coloca la carne previamente dorada. Cocina a fuego muy suave hasta que la carne esté blanda. Si en ese momento aún queda mucho líquido, saca la carne y deja reducir hasta que quede muy poca cantidad. En ese momento agrega 100grs. de mantequilla congelada, cortada en trozos peque?os y agita fuertemente con un removedor para emulsionar la mantequilla en la salsa de vino. Sirve la carne ba?ada con la salsa.<br>  <br>  Saludos,<br>  <br>  H.<br>  <br>  P.D. El Venado no es una especie amenazada, pero imagino que al igual que con ciertos animales de bonita o dulce apariencia (como un conejo), la gente siente remordimiento de comérselos.

Get engaged in some other things which you like to do. Try to sleep early. If you go on like this you will get addicted. Daily intake of huge quantity will affect your life in your later ages.

Plus you are only 19! how are you getting the beer? Someone is buying it for you...I think it wouldn't be a bad idea to slow down...how about just drinking on a wednesday or friday or just on the weekends. The only problem I can see with only drinking at home is that you are going to associate home with beer or drinking. Then if your drinking increases and you do become a full on alcoholic it is going to be harder for you to stop. <br>  I bet you have one heck of a beer belly from drinking beer like that! lol! at least that will go away and if it is not there yet...don't worry it will come.....|`|t7QABoE2aa	There is a test you can take that measures alcohol consumption, which may be VERY useful in your case.

Alcoholism is the popular term for two disorders, alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence. The hallmarks of both these disorders involve repeated life problems that can be directly attributed to the use of alcohol. Both these disorders can have serious consequences, affecting an individual's health and personal life, as well as having an impact on society at large. Now me and you are dependent on alcohol we drink everyday and we like it the way it makes us feel but i really dont think its that bad actually its pretty healthy to drink alittle bit every day.

53giV6PFaa	I have made this one several times and it's a very good recipe.  There is a crust recipe, but I cheated and use pre-made dough from the market.<br>  <br>  DEEP DISH APPLE PIE by The Barefoot Contessa<br>  <br>  Ingredients:<br>      * 4 pounds Granny Smith apples, peeled, quartered, and cored<br>      * 1 lemon, zested<br>      * 1 orange, zested<br>      * 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice<br>      * 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed orange juice<br>      * 1/2 cup sugar, plus 1 teaspoon to sprinkle on top<br>      * 1/4 cup all-purpose flour<br>      * 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br>      * 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br>      * 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg<br>      * 1/8 teaspoon ground allspice<br>      * Perfect Pie Crust, recipe follows<br>      * 1 egg beaten with 1 tablespoon water, for egg wash<br>  <br>  Directions:<br>  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.<br>  <br>  Cut each apple quarter in thirds crosswise and combine in a bowl with the zests, juices, 1/2 cup sugar, flour, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice.<br>  <br>  Roll out half the pie dough and drape it over a 9- or 10-inch pie pan to extend about 1/2-inch over the rim. Don't stretch the dough; if it's too small, just put it back on the board and re-roll it.<br>  <br>  Fill the pie with the apple mixture. Brush the edge of the bottom pie crust with the egg wash so the top crust will adhere. Top with the second crust and trim the edges to about 1-inch over the rim. Tuck the edge of the top crust under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp the 2 together with your fingers or a fork. Brush the entire top crust with the egg wash, sprinkle with 1 teaspoon sugar, and cut 4 or 5 slits.<br>  <br>  Place the pie on a sheet pan and bake for 1 to 1 1/4 hours, or until the crust is browned and the juices begin to bubble out. Serve warm.<br>  Perfect Pie Crust:<br>  <br>  12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) very cold unsalted butter<br>  <br>  3 cups all-purpose flour<br>  <br>  1 teaspoon kosher salt<br>  <br>  1 tablespoon sugar<br>  <br>  1/3 cup very cold vegetable shortening<br>  <br>  6 to 8 tablespoons (about 1/2 cup) ice water<br>  Dice the butter and return it to the refrigerator while you prepare the flour mixture. Place the flour, salt, and sugar in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade and pulse a few times to mix. Add the butter and shortening. Pulse 8 to 12 times, until the butter is the size of peas. With the machine running, pour the ice water down the feed tube and pulse the machine until the dough begins to form a ball. Dump out on a floured board and roll into a ball. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.<br>  <br>  Cut the dough in half. Roll each piece on a well-floured board into a circle, rolling from the center to the edge, turning and flouring the dough to make sure it doesn't stick to the board. Fold the dough in half, place in a pie pan, and unfold to fit the pan.

Brush the Strudel dough with some melted butter and sprinkle it with breadcrumbs. Spread the apples and the raisins evenly on top of it. If desired add some chopped nuts and/or grated lemon peel. By lifting the cloth on one side, roll up the Strudel. Let it slide from the cloth onto a buttered baking sheet. Brush the Strudel with some melted butter or egg yolk. Depending on the size it should bake for 30..40 minutes in a fairly hot oven (200xC/400xF).

Good choices for tart are Granny Smiths, Empires, or Cortlands; for sweet, we recommend Golden Delicious, Jonagolds, or Braeburns. Wrap leftovers tightly in plastic wrap and store at room temperature for up to 24 hours. To reheat, remove the wrap and warm the pie in a 350° oven for 15 to 20 minutes. See below for freezing instructions.<br>  Makes one 9-inch pie, serving 8 to 10<br>  <br>  All-Butter Pie Pastry:<br>  2 ? cups unbleached all-purpose flour (12 1/2 ounces), plus additional flour for work surface<br>  1 tsp. salt<br>  1 Tbs. sugar<br>  1 cup unsalted butter, cold, cut into 1/2-inch cubes and frozen for 10 minutes<br>  3 Tbs. sour cream<br>  1/3 cup ice water, more if needed<br>  <br>  Apple filling:<br>  ? cup granulated sugar (3 1/2 ounces), plus 1 teaspoon<br>  ? cup packed light brown sugar (1 3/4 ounces)<br>  ? tsp. salt<br>  1 Tbs. lemon juice<br>  ? tsp. grated lemon zest<br>  1/8 tsp. ground cinnamon<br>  2 ? lbs. tart apples (firm), about 5 medium, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices (see note)<br>  2 ? lbs. sweet apples (firm), about 5 medium, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices (see note)<br>  1 egg white, beaten lightly<br>  <br>  For Pastry: <br>    Process flour, salt, and sugar together in food processor until combined, about 3 seconds. Add butter and pulse until butter is size of large peas, about ten 1-second pulses. <br>    Using fork, mix sour cream and 1/3 cup ice water in small bowl until combined. Add half of sour cream mixture to flour mixture; pulse for three 1-second pulses. Repeat with remaining sour cream mixture. Pinch dough with fingers; if dough is floury, dry, and does not hold together, add 1 to 2 tablespoons ice water and process until dough forms large clumps and no dry flour remains, three to five 1-second pulses.<br>    Turn dough out onto work surface. Divide dough into 2 balls and flatten each into 4-inch disk; wrap each disk in plastic and refrigerate until firm but not hard, 1 to 2 hours, before rolling. (Dough can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours. Let thoroughly chilled dough stand at room temperature for 15 minutes before rolling.)<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  For Pie: <br>    Mix 1/2 cup granulated sugar, brown sugar, salt, zest, and cinnamon in large bowl; add apples and toss to combine. Transfer apples to Dutch oven (do not wash bowl) and cook, covered, over medium heat, stirring frequently, until apples are tender when poked with fork but still hold their shape, 15 to 20 minutes. (Apples and juices should gently simmer during cooking.) Transfer apples and juices to rimmed baking sheet and cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. While apples cool, adjust oven rack to lowest position, place empty rimmed baking sheet on rack, and heat oven to 425 degrees.<br>    Remove 1 disk of dough from refrigerator and roll out between 2 large sheets of parchment paper or plastic wrap to 12-inch circle, about 1/8 inch thick. (If dough becomes soft and/or sticky, return to refrigerator until firm.) Remove parchment from one side of dough and flip onto 9-inch pie plate; peel off second layer of parchment. Working around circumference, ease dough into plate by gently lifting edge of dough with one hand while pressing into plate bottom with other hand. Leave dough that overhangs plate in place; refrigerate until dough is firm, about 30 minutes. <br>    Meanwhile, roll second disk of dough between 2 large sheets of parchment paper or plastic wrap to 12-inch circle, about 1/8 inch thick. Refrigerate, leaving dough between parchment sheets, until firm, about 30 minutes. <br>    Set large colander over now-empty bowl; transfer cooled apples to colander. Shake colander to drain off as much juice as possible (cooked apples should measure about 8 cups); discard juice. Transfer apples to dough-lined pie plate; sprinkle with lemon juice.<br>    Remove parchment from one side of remaining dough and flip dough onto apples; peel off second piece of parchment. Pinch edges of top and bottom dough rounds firmly together. Following illustrations 1 through 4, trim and seal edges of dough, then cut four 2-inch slits in top of dough. Brush surface with beaten egg white and sprinkle evenly with remaining teaspoon sugar.<br>    Set pie on preheated baking sheet; bake until crust is dark golden brown, 45 to 55 minutes. Transfer pie to wire rack and cool at least 1 1/2 hours. Cut into wedges and serve.<br>  <br>  Freezing Instructions:<br>    We tried two different methods for freezing: (1) fully assembled and ready to go directly from freezer to oven and (2) divided into separate components of crust and cooked apple filling to be thawed, assembled, and baked. Both versions were good, although the reassembled pie was deemed marginally better for its slightly flakier, more evenly browned crust.

PDotv2Hsaa	Food critics are first and foremost journalists/writers. Most have been writing for a while, before settling into writing specifically for this area. To be a good writer, you must write well and it pays to have a refined palate and an adventurous and open mind. <br>  <br>  You are thinking more of being a food or restaurant consultant, not a critic. There are F&B consultancies out there which help in opening a business - including planning the kitchen layout to the menu. Unless you have actual experience and a proven track record in this, perhaps you should work for a consultancy first, before embarking on your own business.

Dann wurde es abgefüllt in gro?kalibrige Wurst.<br>  In Norddeutschland kennt man das so ?hnlich, allerdings auch noch in einer weiteren Variante mit Rosinen- dort hei?t dieses "Zeugs"- "Knipp".Gebraten mit Rotwurst und Apfelmus ein Typisches Frühstück- der l?ndlichen Art.

The third is the salad, which shoudl be the complete opposite of the fourth course, the main entree. The salad should focus more on complementing the appetizer and the wine served with it. The salad course is used mainly as a palette cleanser for the entree and dessert more than anything else.

Este ser vivo é a levedura - um fungo microscópico. <br>  O fermento é composto por leveduras que se alimentam de a?úcar. Produz duas coisas: álcool e o gás dióxido de carbono.

70a4d9f1c08980346a36dbfa928ab315aa	Ol@!!<br>  Falou café?? Hummm!!! Já estou sentindo aquele cheirinho maravilhoso! E para beber um bom café, como toda cafeóloga, n?o tem hora, pode ser de manha até a noite e tem que ser puro, é claro, e sem a?úcar! Hehe!! Para quem ainda n?o conhece existe um nome que esta revolucionando o mundo do café: Nespresso!!  Degustar Café de Luxo vai virar mania no Brasil, a exemplo do que já acontece lá fora. Acaba de aterrissar nos Jardins a Nespresso, primeira boutique bar da rede suí?a na América Latina. Com George Cloney como garoto-propaganda vende máquinas de café com design super arrojado (objeto de desejo, a Essenza custa R$ 850) e cápsulas coloridas de alumínio, que armazenam o café moído por até um ano (R$ 18 a caixa com dez unidades). Também dá para degustar na própria boutique. S?o 12 tipos de café: nove expressos e três longos. O blockbuster é o Ristreto, o mais intenso e encorpado de todos. Incluo em seu roteiro gastron?mico. (MS) Nepresso fica na rua Padre Jo?o Manuel, 1.164 tel: (11) 3064-9974. A dica é da Vogue Radar - S?o Paulo.<br>  O melhor café que já tomei em toda minha vida!!<br>  Use e abuse!!<br>  Um @bra?o!!|`|AA12005596	Gosto. Vou tomar um agora. Só n?o curto esse Nescafé.

Nós mesmos fazíamos. Púnhamos na xícara o pó com a?úcar, depois púnhamos umas gotas de água e fazíamos uma pasta bem batida. Isso permitia que o café ficasse bem cremoso, com muita espuma. Fora disso, isto é, mais tarde, passei a gostar do que se chama uma "italiana" em Lisboa. Trata-se dum café expresso, feito em máquina italiana ( no Porto chamam cimbalino, porque normalmente a máquina é Cimbali). A "italiana" é um café expresso curto, isto é, com pouca água, mas a mesma quantidade de pó de café. Um "carioca" é ao contrário, um café com muito mais água, ou seja mais fraco. Quando estive em Itália apercebi-me de que o café normal é igual ao que em Portugal se chama "italiana" e quando estive no Rio também me apercebi que o café é como o "carioca" de Lisboa, isto é, um café bem aguado. O nome é no feminino, "italiana", porque se entende que é uma "bica", havendo ainda bares em Lisboa onde sabem que uma bica é um café acompanhado por um copo de água, mesmo que hoje a água já n?o venha da "bica", a fonte mais próxima. Ontem bebi um café coado em casa de minha sogra. é assim que o meu sogro gosta. Por mim, confesso que prefiro café expresso, feito em máquina própria, sob press?o. Quando estive em S?o Paulo andávamos quilómetros só para encontrar café à moda de Lisboa, ou seja, à italiana.<br>  Só li a resposta anterior à minha depois. Ristreto é o café a que em Lisboa se chama "italiana".|`|7884bd03993aeb589f10a2959fadd979aa	Sou f? desse neguinho!<br>  Gosto da companhia dele no café da manh?, após o almo?o e no meu lanche das 06.<br>  Agora, quando estou em casa, tenho que me vigiar , se n?o, tomo o dia inteiro.<br>  <br>  Beijos da Chica.|`|983BZs9Vaa	bom, eu trabalhava de noite e o café era o meu companheiro, agora adquiri hipertens?o, e n?o posso  mais desfrutar deste prazer, realmente, descobri que a cafeína faz mal a saúde.|`|DEGRY0uPaa	nem me fale em cafeína, sou viciado.|`|KKzDLCr6aa	Hummm me deu uma vontade agora ..acho ke vou tomar um cafézinho <br>  huahauhauah|`|a5064a9caf022f31b7e7d3dc803f7fc0aa	Gosto de cafezinho tbém, mas às vezes tbém todo com leite.|`|fb5885eb7dbffaa39cdb6e78d172d489aa	Café e cha, ambos puros, sem a?ucar ou ado?ante|`|517da75bbee5b4f2ddfe13d2b368b3b0aa	sim,se tiver fresco eu aceito,o meu sem a?úcar ,por favor.|`|Hv1IBEiiaa	Adoro café também.... coado se for no coador de pano é bem melhor sen?o pode ser o de papel mesmo, o melhor é aquele moido vendido nas cafeterias, mas se n?o for possivel vai uma dica, na hora de passar o café no coador adicione um colherzinho de chocolate em pó ou ent?o na hora de servir, sirva com um pauzinho de canela... humm fica muito bom!|`|rZ6akGcKaa	Eu adoro.
