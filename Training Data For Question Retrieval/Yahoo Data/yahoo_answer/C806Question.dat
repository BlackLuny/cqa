My personal experience...for 6 months I exercised an hour-2 hours a day and kept my calories around 1200-1400 a day and did not lose any weight, zilch.  So it got me wondering, what could possibly be going on with my body that I can work out so much, eat healthy and low calories and still not lose weight?   That led me to think of what I was eating, lots of soy products, mainly tofu.   I'm going to try to cut it, but it's hard to imagine what I'll use as a replacement.    Anyone have any thoughts on it or personal experiences?

The trouble is that it will be a 7 minute walk to the store and a 7 minute walk back up a hill and it's quite cold outside. So I don't know if it's worth it just to get a Pepsi.      So the question I am posing to you is: Is it worth going to the shop to buy a Pepsi and will I feel better after having done so?
