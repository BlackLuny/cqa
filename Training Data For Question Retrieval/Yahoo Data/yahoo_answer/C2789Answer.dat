If you going to tacobell order 2 soft tacos and nachos  If your going to burger king order 1 hamburger and fries    Good luck and i hope i helped!!!|`|JfVxCDb7aa	It'll have to be BK, as Taco Bell doesn't have a dollar menu--I believe they call it a 1.39 section. BK can give you Whopper Jr.s and fries and pop for a buck each.|`|WMem5AGoaa	**Burger King**|`|M9RJLpqEaa	Burger King...Yumm..whopper,swiss mushroom,chicken burger or nuggets with fries!!!

Iqifd3SGaa	Well I had a doctors appointment at 2:30 and my husband had the car for work and came home at 1:30, which is early, to take me to my doctor's appointment. We tried to make it in time but didn't, if we did though I probably would of missed my doctor's appointment. But we are still getting the free grand slam!!! We were waiting in line like 2 minutes before it ended and they gave us a rain check because we were still there before 2pm. So we are going to go today, which all worked out perfectly. I like their food actually and I got to my doctor right on time and when we go today it isn't going to be packed with long lines around the corner like it was yesterday.|`|I7sS4w0maa	Nope not I   I am not a fan of the Grand Slam and the ONLY Denny's I will ever eat at is in Fremont Ca and I live 3 hours away|`|s6ekS4IQaa	Really? I live in California but there are tons of Denny's around so chances are my local one has the deal too. I'm not the biggest fan of Denny;s but I'll have to give it a try! Thanks for letting me know, I always like free food!|`|hxM8AXVRaa	I drove by but the line was wrapped around the parking lot. I really hate to wait in line unless it's for something really cool not some free food.|`|eTNK026xaa	ummmmmmmmmmmmm ya LOSER
VDpmh2VJaa	I live in fla and you havent been to ours..lol  no one speaks english..i get tired of trying to point for what i want.lol|`|YkseyT7zaa	I bet your not racist either|`|WX1b747Iaa	It's a nest of the Secret White Cabal. Oops, sssh.|`|hwIMJBVpaa	thats where they hold the weekly KKK meetings...everyone knows that.|`|qE5XIAsYaa	you must not live in NYC...|`|9CKrP9Keaa	You're a Racists just the way you asked the question. I've been to many Wendy's and there is always a mixed ethnicity of people working there.|`|sDHxandWaa	then you need to come to my town....i worked at wendy's a couple months ago and i think that (including me) there was 4 people there that was white. everyone else was black.|`|sqPoFZ00aa	I used to work at Wendy's and not everyone that goes there is white.|`|IqNLR5BBaa	Not true in my area, South Carolina, they are almost all black.  Our McDonalds is usually all white though. And I don't see hispanic or asians anywhere working??|`|zKM4ypDMaa	I don't know about that but My sister works there and she's black and I usually don't see any blacks inside but we love wendy's and i guess they just hit the drive thru instead.|`|kyTBaYFlaa	depends on location|`|0a5e3ca6e627a0f07f1948ce4430d13eaa	because that b.s, is nasty|`|85vDqn6naa	Come to michigan, i always encounter the nicest black folk workin wendys|`|WT0dGgoMaa	I have no idea. I worked on/off at a Wendy's in Ohio for years during high school and after. We had a great deal of mexican and african americans as well as caucasians. Even had 2 chinese people in the time I worked there.|`|6TA3iPvqaa	because they are at chinese restaurants, mexican restaurants, and kfc.|`|KjodG3ucaa	everyone else join jenny graig or a health club.except those obese white folk.
cFaCmYrXaa	I heard all of the assistant managers at Denny's went dumpster diving at the closest Bob Evans restaurant near them in the middle of the night and donated their treasures to Grand Slam day today.|`|I7sS4w0maa	Nope not a fan of the Grand Slam|`|7e8bc035fbc4202cab9752f48570b6b1aa	I didn't feel like dealing with the wait. So I didn't go.|`|3Wg9nzVjaa	Thought about going there for lunch but decided it would probably be too crowded, besides, I already had a pretty big breakfast.  Just grabbed a salad from the cafe at work.
4fa79de8d4adb453bf0fc4b67ec663b2aa	the mc donalds parfait. its like yogurt with berries and strawberries its delicioso!!|`|GHd84xipaa	yes Wendy's has a $1.00 salad and grill chicken sandwich.|`|pueeMH6gaa	You would be healthiest to eat the actual menu itself rather than any of the garbage listed on it.|`|5e9Fjbm8aa	McDonald's chicken snack wrap (grilled chicken not fried). It's small, not fried and has less carbs than a burger...|`|EV2LMaiLaa	they are all over 400 cal. all bad
