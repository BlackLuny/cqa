I1w0HfQbaa	This woman is a scam artist, plain and simple. If you have tax problems she will not help you. Thanks for the question because I read complaints about her years ago on the Bad Business Bureau's website and not a single person had anything nice to say about her useless services. If you have tax problems do it straight up with the IRS because she is known mainly for her greed and wanting to make money and nothing more. Her lawyers are salesmen who will promise you they can help you if you pay a fee--usually around $4,500--to settle you debt and by the end of the year you will receive a letter saying there was nothing she could do for you and she can no longer represent you as an attorney. You will still be riddled with tax problems but you will lose thousands from Ronnie. My advice: Stay away from this blood sucker!|`|bru2xnlRaa	It is kind of like going to H & R Block to get your taxes done. <br>  If you have simple ordinary taxes you won't have a problem. <br>  But then, you could do Turbo Tax if this is you.|`|Qn5mn99vaa	I see her commercials in every state. I remember a friend of mine saying that her parents used her services and were extremely unhappy. Couldn't tell you why though, this was a few years ago.|`|bT0kyzRPaa	shes on commersials here in baton rouge and at my parrents house in houston so i guess she covers a lot of ground
7NeeQqRqaa	I wouldn't advise getting your tongue pierced at a market, the staff are probably not very experienced and will not follow health and safety guidelines. <br>  <br>  Another thing that you may want to bear in mind.......if they pierce the main vein under your tongue you may actually die :-S I know that sounds a bit far fetched but my friend was advised she couldn't have her tongue pierced because her vein was too big. I would definately recommend a creditable piercing company.|`|W6wamWLLaa	In a market?! Probably wont be clean!!<br>  Go to somewhere more proffessional.
5zQbG8TDaa	Here is an office number for them. It is 407-282-2004. They can answer all your questions.
