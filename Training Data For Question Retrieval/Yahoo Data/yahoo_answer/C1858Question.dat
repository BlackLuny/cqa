20090304163911AADwqIW	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	How do I convert a decimal to binary WITH the leading zeroes?	I have an int[] array with many decimals that I want to convert to binary with. However, upon converting to binary with the toBinaryString() method it returns a string. This is good cause then I can manually add the zeroes on but this means that I have to convert it back to an integer with Integer.parseInt() which then removes the leading zeroes that I just added on.       Is there anyway of adding zeroes onto the binary number after it's been converted back into an integer type i.e. can I add zeroes when the binary number isn't a string?      The amount of digits in the binary MUST be 10.

The problem is, the solver keeps coming up with negative values (which is impossible in the context of the problem) or it is saying that it does not converge.  I think the reason it's doing this is that my constraints have different relations; that is some are  =.  How do I accommodate for that?  This is due tomorrow and it's really frustrating me!

20090304174647AAn6Wyv	Computers & Internet;Software	Frostwire/Limewire glitch?	Hello, I'm trying to download a video one of my old friends made, and put on Limewire.  However, when I double-click it, it opens showing 91% complete, downloading at about 80KB/s, and with about 4 mins remaining.  But I've never started downloading it before.  Also, the video   is in .avi format and is about 23 minutes long, and 175.4 MB.  I can open a preview of the video, which always opens to a scene where my skateboarding bud falls on his face.  It skips around and always opens to where 4:45 of the 22:53 video plays, no matter how fast the download is or how much is really "completed" (which I can't know anyway, it always says 91%).  Help?

20090304223729AABc2gS	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	GTX 295 v.s. ATI HD4870x2 - help?	So, i've been doing research on these cards and cannot come up with a sensible conclusion.      With updated drivers, it shows that the 295 beats the HD4870x2 in almost every category regarding framrate.  The 4870x2 only beats the 295 in super high res settings with high anti aliasing (2500*1600).      Also the 295 is ddr3 ram (1768mb) vs the 4870x2 ddr5 (2gb).      Benchmarks show that the nvidia 295 card outperform the ati, but what is driving me crazy is that if it beats it so bad, then why is nvidia switching to ddr5 as well?      Is there something I don't know, is ATI planning for the future and perhaps you can't see how good the card is and will be?  This also refers to unsubstantiated statements that the 295 cannot support dx10.1 or 11, whereas the ati card is specifically made for that.      Any help?

20090304225022AA6HxrY	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	How do I reboot my laptop when recovery disk does not work?	HD crashed.  Blue screen.  ARD did not work.  Backup disk did not work.  Called HP tech.  They tried over the phone, but could not fix, so they suckered me into buying a new "official" HP  ARD disk and Recovery Applications and Drivers disks (which I already had and used to no avail, but HP tech swore my old disks were defective.)  Still does not work - still blue screen. Goes as far as uploading the files, then comes to "Windows Starting", and it freezes on the blue again.   I've tried all the "obvious" solutions, i.e., opening in different versions of safe mode, reloading backed up drivers, used recovery disk, and the  best I've gotten is a few different pop up remarks, but no error numbers to google.   These are some of the pop ups     or   .   Anybody have any suggestions?
20090304230608AAsXTC4	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Need some laptop help please. Has this ever happened to you?	I recently bought my first laptop. I bought a cheap one just to see if I like it as opposed to a desktop. Several times, when on line, windows to my ISP start to open and continue to open faster than I can close them. For every one I close, three more open. The only way I could get it to stop was to shut down at the risk of losing everything else that was open at the time.       My questions: Is the laptop or my ISP? Is there a way to stop it other than to completely shut down? I never had this happen on my desktop.       Thanks for your help.

20090304235324AAt0zqJ	Computers & Internet;Software	Microsoft Excel 2003 help needed. Is there a way to.....?	.....keep formulas assigned to the same cells even after sorting?      Let me elaborate:      I have two columns of data to sum up in a cell located in a third column.      The challenge is that some values in column "A" need to be added to some values in column "B" in a staggered way from row to row. It isn't a repeatable pattern, and I can't simply add up the entire column.      For example, these are the data in each column:      column "A"      row 1:  1   row 2:  5   row 3:  4   row 4:  5      column "B"      row 1: 3   row 2: 6   row 3: 7   row 4: 9      Let's say that in C1, I set up the following formula: =sum(a1+a3+b2+b4)      Now imagine that I have to do a similar staggering over 3,000 rows but in a more non-repetitive sequence than my example.      In the interest of making such a process less time consuming than going line-by line, is there a way that I can sort the data so that all the values that I need to add from column "A" can be done with a range formula, as well as the ones from column "B", then re-sort them back to their original arrangement without disrupting the formulas?      I have an Intermediate skill level with Excel so please take your time describing what I need to do. If you need me to elaborate further I'll be glad to do so. Just indicate what I need to explain and please check back at a later time. I will respond.      And on a side note, if you are willing to tutor me on an as-needed basis, I'd be most grateful.      Thank you in advance.
20090304225437AAt8bE0	Computers & Internet;Security	A new computer virus giong around..?	My dad's friend, Bud, is a technology buff.  He builds computers and has his own little security camera business.   Well two days ago my computer wouldn't let me log on.  My other friend, Paul, said I got a virus that deleted something that my computer needs to recognize that it's there and it's gone so it won't let me in.  He's working on it now, and I'm obviously on a different computer.      Well, Bud called his friend and his friend said that it's from Cox.com/cox.net website.  I go there almost every day to check my e-mail.  Cox is supposedly denying it, but this virus is I guess about six weeks old.      Well Bud just fixed his computer because he had the same virus.   But, I was just curious if this is happening to you or other people you know?   Is there any way to block it?  Because otherwise I'll have no way to check my e-mail.  If you know, I'd appreciate it if you'd tell me.      Thanks.

20090304235713AAV8soG	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	I Need help on a c language program that enciphers text, please?	Hello, I'm having so much trouble starting this program. I find it very hard since I'm new to c-programming, if you help me out I would greatly appreciate it.      I'm required to write a (simple) program that enciphers text using the vigenere cipher. Basically different alphabets are used to encipher different letters of plain text to disguise letter frequencies, with the use of a key.   The program should take a string at the command line to use as a key. It will take its input from stdin and write its output to stdout. And there must not be any limit on the size of its input.    The program must check the command-line options if a key is not all letters and terminate with nonzero status.   The cipher only operates on normal alphabets(A-Z)(a-z), and all lower case letters are mapped to upper case.      **I do now that I must use arrays, pointers and strings, the problem is I do not know how to combine or use them**      I'm encouraged to use these functions  :int isalpha, tolower, toupper getchar, fgetc, putchar, fputc, strcmp, strlen.          If you could help me in anyway I would greatly appreciate it,    Thanks :)

20090304225256AAfpaDw	Computers & Internet;Software	Game as my desktop, is it possible?	Hello.   I would like to know if it is possible to replace the desktop wallpaper of my computer (which runs Windows Vista Home Premium 64-bit) with a game.   If you have used the media player Winamp and its visualization, u may have noticed a desktop mode, where it sets the visualization as the desktop background. Is it possible to do something similar with a computer game? I know this question might sound a bit "outlandish" but I'm serious.   Honestly, I'm expecting a "No you cant, not possible" kinda answer, but any help on this would be helpful.   Thanks in advance. :)

20090304225436AAefnFg	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Battery care and use instructions?	Your new battery comes in a discharged condition and must be charged before use. Upon initial use (or after prolonged storage period) the battery may require two to three charge/discharge cycles before achieving maximum capacity.      When charging the battery for the first time your charging device may indicate that charging is complete after just 10 or 15 minutes. This is a normal phenomenon with rechargeable batteries. Simply remove the battery from the charging device and repeat the charging procedure.      It is important to condition (fully discharge and then fully charge) the battery every two to three weeks. Failure to do so may significantly shorten the battery's life (this does not apply to Li-Ion batteries, which do not require conditioning). To discharge, simply run your device under the battery's power until it shuts down or until you get a low battery warning. Then recharge the battery as instructed in your user's manual.      If the battery will not be in use for a month or longer, it is recommended that it be removed from the device and stored in a cool, dry, clean place.      It is normal for a battery to become warm during charging and discharging.      A charged battery will eventually lose its charge if unused. It may therefore be necessary to recharge the battery after a storage period.       Power by  http://www.power-battery.com.au/LAPTOP_B...

Since Then ,I departed from Bow Wow and I've been grinding real hard doing shows and putting my music online to get honest feedback. Now that I've been getting good reviews I feel confident to pursue a big record deal with ENIMEN, 50 Cent, Lil Wayne, Jay-z,T-Pain, 50, Chris Brown, JD, or Soulja Boy . Or should I stay Independent at start my own empire.          Basically I'm sending you this message because, Im looking to build new honest friends on youtube... You seem like the type to keep it real..    Recently I made a song dedicated to 50 Cent called " 50 cent to see"    wich is on my new FREE mixtape " Murder she wrote". I need you to let me know if i really have a chance to sign with 50 cent.

I signed up with as a musician, and did all the necessary things that are required for musicians, and yet when I do a search for myself I am only found as a person instead of a music profile. This is unacceptable for me and I need to know how this problem occurred in the first place and how I can get it to be exactly what I signed up for it to be?      Mind you that I have the full features of a music myspace profile on the home page, I can manage my music, calendar hows, etc. But I can't be searched as if it were a music profile and it refuses to display my genre and says I'm 105 years old.  So I fail to see why I'm having a problem....and why is myspace having so many silly problems that facebook isn't encountering?      thanks for your help :D

And, I prefer HP, but any other suitable option, let me know (and why).  I would prefer a system that has XP rather than Vista, but I suppose Microsoft is trying to phase out XP.

In my school notes, it just states this:   class Queue{    // all the required stuff are input here.   }      int main()   {   Queue q;   q.push('a');   q.pop();   }      I get the error that 'pop' and 'push' are not initialised. As in the class Queue do not have a member named 'pop' and 'push'. So how exactly is 'push' and 'pop' initialised and used? Thanks.

20090305012027AAtBYZx	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Desktop computer problem... slow?	Yesterday I noticed my computer was very slow. I recently installed a few programs on my computer which may or may not be the result of my computer being much slower. My computer is only four months old, and it's an HP. I recently downloaded these programs:      1. alcohol 120% (downloaded from the internet)   2. Deamon Tools (downloaded from the internet)   3 Italian Language v3.0 Software (I purchaced from a local store)      I uninstalled number 1 & 2. And did a norton virus scan for the whole computer, and one low risk cookie was removed, but that's it. After running the scan my computer was at normal speed, but when I turned it back on this morning it was slow again. I would call a computer tech. but I am stationed in Italy, and we don't have anyone here that does that. The internet is fast as it always has been, its mainly when I try to open all my applications (like control pannel, my computer, internet explorer, etc.) Any ideas on what to do?

20090305002339AAQ5qfR	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Help with running time of these loops?	Can you say if i am correct with my answers below:         1. Give the running time of the following method.            double dotProduct(double[] a, double[] b)         {          double sum = 0.0;                    for (int i = 0 ; i < a.length ; i++)          {           sum += (a[i] * b[i]);          }                    return sum;         }      i get O(1) + n*O(1) = O(n)               2. Give the running time of the following method.            boolean inFirstFive(char c, String s)         {          int limit = 5;          if (s.length() < 5) {           limit = s.length();          }             for (int i = 0 ; i < limit ; i++) {           if (s.charAt(i) == c) {            return true;           }          }             return false;         }      i get O(5) since in the worst case the loop will run 5 times, but i am not sure if i have to take into account the if statement above and other statements.         3. Give the running time of the following method.            int countCommonNumbers(double[] array1, double[] array2)         {          int count = 0;             for (int i = 0 ; i < array1.length ; i++) {           for (int j = 0 ; j < array2.length ; j++) {            if (array1[i] == array2[j]) {             count++;             break;            }           }          }             return count;         }      i get O(mn) if m= array1.lenght and n = array2.length         4.

Today, when I switched on my computer, then the appearence was changed like those of windows 95. When I tried to change the appearence to xp (from the desktop properties box, under appearence tab), then that option was not being displayed. I then restarted my system and then follow the same path to change the appearence then shocking xp option was there. I am not sure, but I think that somebody is accessing my system remotely. Is that so?? If yes, then how to protect my computer from such access. Please help. It will be appreciated. Thank You

I don't know why, but the other day, perhaps a week ago, I turned on the laptop (some 2007 model of a MEDION, with Microsoft Office 2007 & Windows Vista) and as it was going through the usual loading screens, the screen went black and hundreds, if not thousands, of lines of white, MS-DOS style text went blasting up the screen as if someone was fast-forwarding through the credits of a movie. This continued for about 15 minutes, perhaps 20. I was afraid to turn the laptop off,as I didn't want to damage it by interrupting whatever process was that was obviously taking place. Now, I can only access the Guest profile, the two master profiles are hardly usable (the desktop icons don't work, Microsoft Office is installed in the programs menu but every time I attempt to open it, it says it isn't, the internet isn't accessible, etc.), etc., etc., etc.       Is there anyone out there that has any idea of what is going on? I can update this with more details if it will help. (I've done virus-scans, spyware scans using the guest profile; it said that nothing was there...)

20090305014142AAnuvI0	Computers & Internet;Security	Which Internet Security system is better?	So I had McAfee on my other computer and recently got a new one, (it was a christmas present) and obviously by now everything is 'broken in' I'm use to the new windows vista and what not, BUT I was sure what Security system was better. (I changed brands from HP to Dell, so I was unsure if it made a difference.)    i was looking around and a site recommended Norton, they provided a link, and I downloaded it from there. Well I was a little skeptical so I went ahead and downloaded McAfee as well.    This is where the problem comes in. I'm very touche when it comes to my computer and do Virus scans and cleanings and what not regularly.    Norton randomly popped up one day requesting to do a scan (Even though I have it set to do manually.)    I went ahead and allowed it to scan. It said I had three viruses and over thirty cookies (which I know aren't always bad) But then when I tried to fix that issue, it said I had to upgrade my package to clean my computer. It pissed me off. So I did a scan using McAfee to see if I could remove the viruses using it instead. The scan came completely clean (It doesn't report cookies unless they're causing issues) I thought that there might be something wrong. But just today when I accidentally went on an infected site, McAfee thankful stopped the site from infecting me with a nasty little Trojan.    SO so I uninstall Norton, or is it right about the viruses? Was it possible that McAfee missed them?

The wireless, internet, and LAN lights on the router are steady green, and the ethernet, DSL, and internet lights on my modem are steady green as well. I can access the internet by just plugging the ethernet cable straight from the modem to my laptop, but I want to go wireless.      I followed the directions on Netzero's DSL support page,  http://help.netzero.net/support/dsl/conn...  and still no luck.      And now I can't even access my router login page! I typed in  http://192.168.1.1  and the page won't load.       If you have the time and don't mind a challenge I'd really appreciate the help!      P.S. If it makes any difference I bought the router online so it didn't come with the resource CD.      Thanks!

20090305013828AAOwa0i	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	I need help finding my ideal laptop for college!?	I'm currently using an HP Mini Note 2133. I love it, and despite reviews about its processor, it works very smoothly for me. I love it. However, I think I might have to get a full laptop for college, which I'm starting this June. You know, one with a CD drive.      My new laptop has to be   - Portable: I love netbooks because they're so small and light.   - Fast: The processor on my netbook right now is at 1.6Ghz. I'm interested in getting 2.0Ghz or higher. 2.5Ghz, ideally. Now that I'll be getting a laptop with an optical drive, might as well use it to play games as well. Haha.   - Awesome Screen: I want a laptop with a great screen, high display resolution is ideal.   - Long Life: I only have the 3cell battery for my HP Mini Note 2133. It doesn't really last more than three hours, so long batt life on a full charge is ideal.      Does anyone have any suggestions on what I should get? Not a Macbook though, as it's not in my price range. :)) And I do like the functionality and compatibility of Windows.       Any suggestions would be highly appreciated! :D

Hello i just bought this video card ---) SAPPHIRE 100259-1GL Radeon HD 4870 1GB 256-bit GDDR5 PCI Express 2.0 x16 HDCP Ready CrossFire Supported Video Card - Retail   http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...       It states 500 Watt or greater power supply with (TWO) 75W 6-pin PCI Express power connectors recommended      So im thinking bout getting this Power supply  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...       My question is:      1. Since it requires two 75w 6 pin connectors, does that power supply i'm thinking about getting gonna work? i know it comes with a 6 pin connector it states. But i need 2?       2. If one of the 75w 6 pin connector goes from POWER SUPPLY to VIDEO CARD, does that mean that the 2nd 75w 6 pin connector goes into the POWER Supply also??       So basically does the power supply i get need to have 2 open slots for TWO 75w 6 pin connectors? Or does 1 connector go into the power supply and 1 connector goes into like the hard drive or something? Do power supplies really come with 2 slots for 75w 6 pin connectors?

20090305033715AAN20it	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	<( ' '<)  Simple Programming Question?	I need to make use the Newton-Raphson function to solve for this.      Everything seems to be working perfectly, except I get "NaN" instead of numerical values after I compile.  I figured out NaN stands for Not a Number, meaning my calculations had some weird divide-by-0-type stuff in it.  I can't find a problem anywhere.  The only place where I have a division sign is in my tolerances section, and I already tried erasing it from my code and I still got the same error.      My starting values:      f(x) = sin(x) +2x +1   d'f(x) = cos(x) +2      from x=-3 to x=3.         Any help?  what's wrong with my code?         #include     #include     double Newton_Raphson(double x0);   double func1(double x);   double func1_d(double x);   int main(void)   {          double x_begin=-3.0, del_x=0.25;           double x, x_old, x0, root, f_x, f_x_old;           int k;           char sign_change;   /*  If there's a sign change, I put "Y" next to that value of x.

Hi,   when I try to connect my MP3-Player with my Computer, I get the message that a new USB Device was found and everything works fine - besides the Player is nor shown as local disk nor as USB device. I just tried to give him a disk drive letter - and it is not shown anyway. Well, I know that my PC recognises him cause he shows the "remove device" dialogue on the task bar - but I am unable to see him at "My Computer" or even to move data/music etc. onto.   I own Windows XP Pro SP2, Player Software given.   Can anyone please help me?

Tech is very sure it is Zone Alarm uninstalled incorrectly.  Since I am a computer novice, I'm sure they are correct.  I have no idea where to go from here.

20070417133559AAos9SY	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	If i upgrade to ie 7 and dont like it can i go back to ie 6 easily?...see  details?	First of all,this is my girlfriends computer and she's the type of person that absolutely hates change....with anything.I think its a disorder of some sort.Anyways,ie 6 is running like crap,it closes itself out all the time,hardly ever works right,gets tons of errors,its always getting a box that comes up and says "work offline" and/or "try again",etc....Needless to say,its a problem.I use firefox and opera,and dont have a problem,but theres those rare cases where you just cant get around using ie.She is not that tech savvy at all so,would she even notice if i updated it?Is there that much of a difference?Can i go back to ie 6 easily if its a problem for her?She wont let me upgrade it,but wont shut up and stop complaining about it at the same time...she thinks its something im doing that causes the problems...typical....Also,she flatly refuses to try opera or firefox,she wont even give it a chance,like i said,shes old   school and hates change.Its a good thing anyways,there customized.

20070527012915AAJY1To	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	A good Unix emulator?	I am currently learning Java on a Windows platform. I've decided it's time to become familiar with Unix.      Before taking the big step of downloading the entire Unix operating system, is there a good emulator I can use to learn Unix on Windows?      I have heard that cygwin is good (www.cygwin.com) but this seems to be based on Linux. I know that Linux is derived from Unix - but would I be 'shooting myself in  the foot' by learning Unix on a Linux emulator?       -Eoghain

20070521175347AAUgvDH	Computers & Internet;Software	XML support not detected.?	I use a software program called PCLaw. It's a billing system. I've used it for years with no problem. Suddenly, today, when I try to start the program, it tells me,      "XML support not detected. Please install Microsoft's XML V3 or V4 support."      What is XML support? And how do I install it? For bonus points, any theory how I might suddenly have lost XML support (given that this program has worked for years now).      I am currrently using Microsoft XP.      Thank you for any help or assistance you may provide.

20070522131504AAbViPe	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Internet Toolbar Problem?	I've had Internet Explorer 7 for a while and their new toolbar along with the Yahoo Toolbar added on. Recently the toolbar would just crawl out of the screen leaving me nothing but the webpage, and when I move my mouse cursor to the top of the screen where the toolbar should be, it reappears. Obviously this should be happening since someone adjusted it to do that, but now I don't have my Yahoo Toolbar and I can't see the volume control, time, or other windows displayed at the bottom of the screen whenever I go on the Internet. How do I stop this?
