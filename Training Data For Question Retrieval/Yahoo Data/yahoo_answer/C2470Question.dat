20090307151258AAITErp	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Do you like this fight between best friends?	This is just a part out of chapter nine that I wrote. I don't want there to be any punching or hitting. But could you please tell me if you thought that it sounded okay and realistic? In the story right before this Alicia, is the main character, her best friend Savanna is having a party at her house and promised her that she would spend the whole night with her and have lots of fun. But as soon as the party started Savanna left and went to hang out with her boyfriend Trace. So Alicia got mad, because that kind of stuff always happens. Please, read it and tell me if you think that it sounds okay. I know that there might be grammar and spelling mistakes.      Claire and I was dancing to the song that they were currently playing, when Savanna walked over to me.       "Hey chica, what's up?" She said with a smile on her face.      I was so not falling for this.      "What the hell is wrong with you?" I asked her not caring if I really told her how I felt.      Her face dropped that smile as she strutted, "Uh... What are you talking about?"      "You know perfectly damn well what I am talking about."      Claire gave me an annoyed look as she put one hand on her hip and turned her head to the side, "Oh, well apparently Alicia is just having the worst time of her life at this party and she is mad at you, Savanna, because you won't spend every single second with her."      She was staring right at me. Why did Claire always have to be on Savanna's side and gang up against me. Would it hurt her just once to agree with me?       Savanna looked at me with her big eyes and finally said, "What is she talking about Alicia?"      I looked the other way, wishing I could have this conversation in private and not as a public show on a dance floor. But then I remembered that I started this so I might as well finish it.      "Okay, Savanna I'm just going to tell you the truth. You told me that you would hang out with me a lot tonight and we would have fun. But no, that can't happen you have to be off with Trace the jerk face every second." It finally felt good to get it out in the open, no matter how Savanna felt.      Now Savanna had annoyed look on her face. "Well you know what Alicia? You are not the perfect friend either. You're always negative all the time and I can't be around you all the time to hold your hand. And what is your problem with Trace? If you were as good as a friend, as I thought you were, then you would be happy for me. Not telling me every second that my boyfriend sucks."      That's when Claire started in on me, "Yeah Alicia, you're not all that fun to be with. I always have to hear you complain about what Savanna has done and how Trace is just completely evil. It was okay at first, but now you have reached you're limit. I'm getting tired of this crap with you. And Savanna is right, you are always negative all the time. You don't ever crack a smile or do anything but mope around about how boring my little life is and how my best friend is going out with Trace the jerk face." She smiled when she was finished and then added, "That is a gay nickname, you know."      "Well at least I'm not a **** and with a different guy every other day." I said, it was the only thing that I could think to say. This had really stung.      "At least I'm not a *****!" Claire said back, looking directly into my eyes.      I turned my head to the side. I bit my lip. I was so not going to cry. I will not cry in front of them. They will not see me like this, so I just rolled my eyes and mumbled, "Whatever Claire, why don't you always be against me."      "Come on Savanna, let's get away from her. Who wants to be friends with a negative ***** all the time?" Claire said and grabbed Savanna's arm, laughing.      I wasn't looking at them, but I could feel Savanna look over at me before letting Claire start to drag her away. But then, Savanna laughed with Claire and added, "Totally."      There I was all alone. Alone. In the middle of the dance floor. I didn't have friends anymore or anyone. I hated myself. I hated for what I had done to them. I felt a tear starting to run down my cheek. I turned and started running, putting my hand up to my face trying to cover myself up. I didn't know where I was going, but I had to get out of here.      I felt someone grab my arm, "Whoa. Where are you going like that?"      I stopped dead in my tracks. Who was this person? I turned around and saw the gorgeous guy that I saw earlier at the street crossing and the guy I know for sure smiled at me earlier at the party. It was him. He was finally talking to me. For one second, I totally forgot where I was by looking in his deep brown eyes.

20090307151517AAUgNoE	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What do you think? A Poem or lyrics? or both?	ok, as a poem it would be      Why do we only see the bad?   How come I can't see what we had?   Why do we only see the bad?   All I know is I'm starting to get mad...      Remember the dance?   The mingling and laughter?   The time when...   You don't...   No, no you wouldn't;   You can't. You're human -   And we only see the worse.   *   We really don't stand a chance   Because human memory - a disaster   We can try...   In vain...   I think we shouldn't;   Trying leaves us barren -   It could lead to a hearse.      (I'm filled with)   failed attempts to fly to heaven   through revisited memories past      And as lyrics I would just paste the first stanza at the asterisk, and repeat the last 2 lines a few times. Also, (I'm filled with) would only go on the lyrics, and be whispered if a song :)
20090307150936AAV8uqG	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Are you being all that you desire to be or is there something holding you from reaching your fulfilment?	Many aspire and endeavour to materialise their dreams and aspirations, but many are caught by the entrapment of their own thinking, which precludes them from really experiencing the manifestation of their visualised conception of where they want to be and what they wish to become. We either focus on our current situation that stimulates our awareness of that which we haven't got and so renders us into a state of resisting impatience or frustration, because we do not perceive our selves to be moving rapidly towards that which we are seeking to reach and become. We may not believe that we are equipped with the intelligence or qualities that we believe are needed to establish in our reality realm of thinking and to convert our thinking into a glorious experience. One of the main problems is that we believe that we have to reach a place where we are skilled and educated enough to make our live work. When in actuality is remotely detached from the TRUTH. Express your truths with clarity and precision so that I may answer appropriately. Bless You!

20090307152454AA4XIdK	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Renaming a character..Help.?	After reading a zillion of teen books about vampires, I realize there's many of forms of Damion's (Damon, Damien, Damian...ect) floating around in the teen vampire world. So, after great dread since I LOVE the name Damion and had this character & his name for many years I've decided to change his name.. But I'm having difficulty.      His name is supposed to mean demon, which I liked since he's kind of rude & harsh but with highly romantic facades in front of an old soul (main character).       I've come up with a few names like Caiden, Samael, Alastier, and Damiel..*and yes Damiel is spelled with a m*. But I was wondering if anyone else can brainstorm with me? Maybe you had a good idea of a name that fit the following description?      Tall, 6'4", looong wavy black hair, eyes as green as winter green trees with brown flames that sparked along the iris, strong cheek bones and thick pouty lips that contradicted with the rest of his stern looks.       ?
20090307152309AA656Bq	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of my poem?	I wrote this while my BF Alex was in Florida. Yeah, I'm pretty pathetic without him. I need constructive critizem. Not mean critizem. Just help me out a little please. Thoughts? And no insults towards me ok? I cant take anymore insults from people. T hanks.        Life in the Dark       Sad and angry;   Depressed and lonely.    What more do you want to know?   My mind is blank;    My soul is dark.   I want to be alone.    I want to scream,    To cry, to fight.    Then pass out in my bed at night.    My friends are glad,    But I am sad.    And I just want to hide in the dark.    I don’t know why he had to leave   But I will accept that test.    He’ll be back to pick up my slack.    And make my days much brighter.    I can’t be happy, glad, or normal.    Not without him here.    The sky is cloudy;   The air is cold.    It was to him,   My heart was sold.    I cannot stop my tears today.    For that is God’s demanding way.    I don’t want to be here,   I have no choice.   Because no one wants to hear my voice.    You want proof?    Alright, you asked.    Just hang on tight;   This ride goes fast.    Mom is busy, working and such.    And Daddy does the same.    Emmy really just doesn’t get it.    Ryan is never home to see it.    Adam has a new family chain.   Jenna’s job drives her insane.    Eli doesn’t understand.    My friends tell me    That he’ll be back.    And that it’s self esteem I lack.    Yeah right. So what?   I’m being treated like a mutt.    Sad and angry;   Depressed and lonely.   My life is no day in the park.    And I’d rather just lay and the dark.    To let the emotions flow out of me.   I’ll shut the door and lock my heart.    When he comes home,    I’ll come out of the dark.

20090307152035AACa0hg	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What would you choose?	I am making a Fantasy-story with Light, Darkness & Twilight within it. It's about a boy who lost his parents, his name is Zero. But in truth he is The Chosen Hero. He has a legendary weapon (Looks like the Aerial Blades wielded by Xemnas in Kingdom Hearts 2 or the lances wielded by Shanao in Castlevania Order Of Ecclesia). With this he protects the worlds against evil. But in one point of the story he sacrifies himself for his best friend, a girl named Dawn. He's falling into Darkness but because of his strong heart and all the power hide in it, it's finally about to awaken, he'll be neither or Light or Darkness, thus Twilight. He fights villains from Light and Darkness and his biggest opponents are The God Of Darkness & The Goddess Of Light.      So that is kinda the story. But I need a name for the story. Because of the Twilight serie from Stephanie Meyers I can't use the title Twilight. Here are some examples for the title (I like also title with 1 or 2 words) :   - Into the Twilight   - Between Light & Darkness   - Between Dawn & Dusk   - (From) Dawn to Dusk   - Beyond Dawn & Dusk   - Beyond Light & Darkness   - Beyond Twilight   - (From) Light to Darkness   - (Something else, like.........., I would also like a title with 1 or 2 words)      * I doesn't know a name for the weapon either so maybe you've got an idea, I thought of "Enerblade" but you can also choose own ideas.      I would like Latin or Greek words for the name of the title/weapon also.      And maybe you know a better way to let awaken the Twilight powers from Zero, I fought this way is a little bit stupid. All ideas are welcome.      And I'm sorry if grammar is that worse, I had got some reactions about that.   Thanks ^.^

20090307153859AAFCx1m	Arts & Humanities;History	Do you think that you might act like the Robert Ford did?	Do you think that you might act like the Robert Ford did?   ..He was ashamed of his boasting, his pretension of courage and ruthlessness.   He was sorry about his cold-bloodedness, dispassion, his inability to express what he now believed was the case, that he truly regretted killing Jesse, that he missed the man as much as anybody.   And wished his murder hadn’t been necessary.   He knew that the smiles disappeared when he passed by.   The would be no eulogies for Bob, no photographs of his body would be sold in sundries stores, no biographies would be written about him, no children named after him, no one would ever pay 25 cents to stay in the rooms he grew up in.   The shotgun would ignite and Ella Mae would scream. But Robert Ford would only lay on the floor and look at the ceiling, the light going out of his eyes before he could find the right words.

20090307154400AAZDO4i	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Books like the Underland Chronicles (Gregor the Ovelander) or The Hunger Games?	I've just finished the last book in the Underland Chronicles, and I just can't get it out of my head! I'd really like another book like those or the Hunger Games! All are by Suzanne Collins, by the way. I think what I liked most about them was the fighting with swords, Bow and Arrows, and other such things! I like the battling, the action, and all that kind of stuff.       Basically, I'm looking for action, but not the super modern kind, like where all everybody fights with is guns. Chances are that if you've read either one or both of those books/series, liked it, and have a good suggestion I'll probably like it! I don't want to read anything actionless  or something like that though. I don't care if there is any romance, I'm fine with or without!  Another Series that I liked was the The Twelve Houses Series, By Sharon Shinn if that helps with understanding what I'm looking for!       Also, feel free to suggest any book that you know is really good! Thanks!

We're reading reviews on a Nikkor 50mm f/1.8 AF Lens, for example, but we're not educated enough about lenses and their pros and cons to feel comfortable making a purchase decision without some further input.  Help us out!

Everything is Nothing      When I look into the mirror   I see this girl,   Young, hopeless, and feels like she doesn't belong.      When she looks at him,    She feels full, wanted   Like she's found what shes been looking for.      And when she dreams,   She imagines how life could have been   Without him, Without love.      And as she cries,   she wonders what always makes her feel this way,   upset and disappointed      She hopes, wishes, prays for the pain to go away.      As it fades she feels relieved and   she finds the real her.      While she shows the world the real her,   She realizes that:   'Everything is nothing, until nothing is everything'

It would be helpful if the song could be played on the piano. Broadway is okay but nothing too dramatic.

Hope is the thing with feathers   That perches in the soul,   And sings the tune--without the words,   And never stops at all,      And sweetest in the gale is heard;   And sore must be the storm   That could abash the little bird   That kept so many warm.      I've heard it in the chillest land,   And on the strangest sea;   Yet, never, in extremity,   It asked a crumb of me.      QUESTION: What do the last two lines of the poem mean? Provide your own personal interpretation.

But now is time my morals must omit,   All maple slick along intestined walls   And cross the line in lust I must submit,   My body, soul, my lips where need they fall.

A few years back we had to adapt Adwoods poem of song of the worms heres my adaption   Song of the exploiter      We have lived by lenses and bugs   We have done Whats best   We are the highest form of pure power   We remeber the sacrifice of which we put to a abrupt end      We have lived upon survelance and betrayal   We gave our opaque speeches   We come to improve your lives   At which we are supposed to take sincere consideration      We know that we have caught you   And out petty and wretched promised   We know everything about you   Of which we lle utilise to make you beg for mercy   We are afraid of you    Yet we slither stealthily past you before you realise the deception      Soon we will surface from our fractured innocence   breathing in the wonder of corruption and wrong   We will backstab you and laugh while you bleed   As your sanity will drown, driving you into a shroud of regret and confusion   All my satirists and supporters will fall to their knees my sick domination sending you into another dimension      Meanwhile we will walk away from the deep dark vaults of our minds   We will serve our beautiful country   Lying into your happy eyes   When we show our true colours   You will gasp at the cuningness and disbeleif   For now we will camoflauge into what you call life.

I dressed to be comfortable and later remembered that she said to dress "nice". Many people came in heels/black skirts/dresses.   I think I did pretty well with my audition-I just feel sooo bad, because I take a class in school with the director, and didn't do what she said really.   Should I apologize? It seems kind-of silly, but I don't know if I should do something?

20090307131855AACeLjQ	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Our gender was predetermined?	What if God gave us a choice when we were still in the womb, and telling us the advantages and disadvantages of both genders, and what we picked is what we got?  And the moment we come out is the moment we lose all memory of what happened, and our communication with God is lost because of our sins?      But this question is not about sin, it's about our genders.  Were we the ones that selected it?  So if this was true, then transvestites don't have the right to change their genders lol.      Now I want to be a girl, since being a boy is pretty boring.  You pretty much can do anything a boy can do, and still look good doing it.  You get to wear all those pretty clothes (of BOTH genders as well), make up, nails, and have more variety of hair styles.  You are less likely to have diseases and early deaths.  I'm gonna miss the muscles though, but girls can get that too if they try.

Before you go back, however, you print up a lot of t-shirts and bumper stickers so that you can really impress the voters back in 1784. how well does your plan work?      a: rotten-there was no such thing as President of the U.S. in 1784   b: poor-you forgot that back then the president was elected by the state legislature, so you gave away a lot of t-shirts to people who couldn't help you get elected   c: good-since people believe in republicanism they voted for the flashiest candidate-you of course   d: great-Washington barely won the election anyway, and the bumper stickers were enough to swing the few key voters to you.      i know its not a or b but im not sure about c&d.

20090307143027AAbXzAZ	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I Am The Messenger (Markus Zusak) ending?	*SPOILERS*      I was immediately hooked on this book from it's humor and the personalities of the characters. I experienced the emotions of all the little stories in the middle and fell in love with the old man in the theater. I was moved by the way the characters were brought together and their trials were resolved. But for the life of me, I can't stand the ending of the book. It was more than disappointing to me to read that the whole thing was a set up and that each situation was carefully crafted for the narrator to experience. I'm particularly disgusted that that's true for the wife that was raped repeatedly. Why the hell would they set that up?! That's awful!   And it pains me so because the whole book was so grand before the ending. But the ending was so horrible that I don't think I could recommend the book to anyone to read. It was so much more than a disappointment. It tainted how I view the rest of the book!      Is there anyone that feels the same way? How do you reconcile yourself with the explanation at the end of the book?

What would Prince Henry want people to know about his nation?   What were two enemies and two allies of his country and why?   What was his social status and how did he interact with other social classes?      There's a lot of general info but nothing I found was specific      Thank you in advance!

20090307140234AApf6cY	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is this story i made good?	Ok im gonna start writing a story right now.   Let me think of an idea.   I know its very long but if you can take the time just read as much as you can.    I see a bunch of stories wrote on websites. Can you tell me if my are any better. Im 13 years old a male. Let me take like two minutes to think of a book.      ok i have one but i dont think it is very good.      Ok here ity goes      The elavator beeped and opened with the sliding metallic doors. John Hashing looked up at the red numeric digit above the doors. "1". He looked down at his black leather briefcase. His wife had bought it for him as a christmas present. He enjoyed it and used it all the time. It had a number code so no theif could not access it. He looked around before he stepped into the elavator. He was on the first floor, which held the jewlery store in which many nervous husbands sped to to buy there wife a late anniversery gift. The floor was clean white tile with small gray spots which added to the texture of it. He spotted a woman who was in her mid 20's. She had on a short gray cotton skirt that fit very nice on her slick, curvy body. Her hair was chesnut red and it was curled and long. It rested upon her yellow turtleneck. She glanced at him and he smiled. She didnt even give a wince and turned away to help a customer. He didnt know what was wrong. He was thirty years old. He had a slim face and a nice round chin. He was not overwieght for his age, and usally went to the gym everyday. He looked very successful with his black pinstripe sport coat and his gray cotton pants. His hair was slightly blond in the front and tipped his naturally black hair. He brushed away the thought of the girl. He stepped into the brown elavator. It had an ad for Macys that had a vulgur picture drawn on it for someones amusment. The elavator had a stainless steel metal rod to hold onto, and John leaned on it, putting his briefcase in his wrist and cupping his wrist with his hand. Mr. Hashing worked as a manager for the Riser Hilltop Mall. His destination, the 12 floor to speak to his boss about a new proposal. In the elavator with him, there stood four other individuals. The one who stood closest to him was a badly injured homeless man. His arm was crippled and his face had many bruises on his unshaven dark, weepy face. His eyes were a dark abyss, showing no emotion but pure blankness. He reaked in an odor that carried along with it the smell of piss, feces, and the scent of a man who hasnt showered in a month. The other people in the elavator was an old man with his wife. They held each others hands and were cramped over. They both wore identical green knitted sweaters. The man had a recceding hair line and his face looked as if a washed up beach, wih so much erosion you could barely make out the kind of sand underneath it. The woman wore librarian glasses and had chapped lips. The fourth and not the least important was a man who had a mist about him. He was half blad, had a anxious face that was slimmer than Hashings' and had on a tan checkered sports coat. He held with him a smaller briefcase and kept looking at his watch, as if something was going to happen that would be diasterous and would affect all the occupants fate.      Its not done obviously, not even slightly. Just let me know      If you like it   If you would keep reading it   Predict what will happen   Any suggestions      Thank you guys so much for reading the entire thing i know its long.   Best answer 10 points!!!!!

She had come such a long way already, at a pace that suggested her life depended on it, which it very well did. The Torments were fast approaching. Torments were ugly, malicious little creatures, and once set loose would not stop until they had caught their prey. Unwantingly she paused to catch her breath. The sound of nearby twigs snapping urged her on, so she brushed the sweaty curls from her brow and continued on to her destination.       it doesnt sound right using the word unwantingly is there a better way i could say that?      thanks for you help....ah, and if you could tell me if its any good so far, thank you bunches!

20090307145841AAVP54g	Arts & Humanities;History	Were there two continents whose cultures could've been ANY more different than Africa and Europe?	Not now, but the when Europeans first started to come down into Africa and thought all the people were too different and decided black people were inferior, wasn't that just because the 2 cultures were pretty much the furthest apart than any other??       Like Europe had little land and valued land over people (wars and treatment of people there)   Africa had A LOT of land and valued people over land (slavery)   European women had no rights and stayed in the home   African women were almost equal to the men because they were both dependent on each other for survival   European men wore more clothes because they lived in a cold climate   Africans wore less clothes because it was so hot..... the list goes on and on..... even now when people look at black girls dance and shake their butts and they get all crazy, but black women in old Africa used to dance with their bottoms for their own pride, dancing was a way of saying "look at my nice body" not "I'm a whore" but many people still see that.      Do you think this is where the racism comes in, because blacks and whites have always been the furthest apart in cultures.

20090307145658AA8rVhO	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	For all teenagers and kids.Do you like the first chapter of my book?	I'm 16 and this is the first chapter of my new book series.Do you like it?Please don't point out grammatical mistakes;I'll correct them later.      chapter1.   Elliot crow gasped inside his bed. The air inside the room grew denser in this sultery, summer night. Sweeping the sweat off his forehead, Elliot sat at the edge of his bed and looked around at the silent room. The window was closed.      Elliot took a draught of cold water from the plastic bottle at his side, then he strolled to the window.After he opened the shutters he sniffed the humid air trying to find any sort of coolness inside of the air.      "Dad"      A young boy came walking through the open door. He was in his stripped pajamas,with his brownish hair all disheveled over his round, pale face.      "victor.Why are you awake at such time?. It's nearly three in the morning. Are you ok?".Elliot approached his son, and held him up,hugging him inside his brawny arms.      "Nothing Dad.I'm just a bit afraid.I had a nightmare in which I saw monster.He wanted to swallow me"      "Oh Gosh"Elliot smiled at victor as he laid him in his bed, then adjusted the pillow over his head.       "And what did you do??".Elliot sat next to victor with his arm propped against his pillow,and his fingers running through Victor's damp hair.      "I did nothing.I just woke up.It seemed that as the monster approached me I realized I was dreaming,so I woke up."      "don't worry victor.Here,take this"      Elliot dug his hans deep into the thigh pocket of his blue trousers,and took out a heart shaped locket.The locket had a silver strap that clinked as Elliot slid the locket into victor's neck.      Victor raised the locket in his small palm,and opened it.There was Elliot's picture beaming at Victor out of a black and white picture.      "Do you like it ?"      "yeah Dad ."      "turn it"      Victor turned the locket.On it's back a sentence was carved.Victor squinted to read the interwoven letters.      "read it aloud".   'I'll always be with you"Victor spoke out the sentence,then peeped back at his father.      "it's great"      Victor  shooted at his father's arms,and kissed him twice in the shoulder.      A fit of laughter,tickling,and kicking went on for minutes.Victor wished the laughter went on forever,but he knew,even at five years old,that everything had an end.      "stop..". Elliot whispered forcing victor to stop hopping      As the smile on victor's face faded away ,Elliot was already brushing all over the room. Victor knew from the keen expression on his face that his ears where trying to catch a certain voice that he didn't hear      Elliot turned his sight to the open window.There was a strange breath sound coming into the room.Elliot rushed to the window,nd poked his head.But before he turned his head to examine the left side a whirring of wings seemed to approach his head,and a crackling shill scream came splashing the window panes.      Elliot fell to his rear.      "Hide quickly Victor.Hide in the wardrobe"      Victor dashed to the wardrobe leaving its door ajar.      The shrill scream,along with the whirring of the wings subsided into the silence of the night.Elliot was about to gesture at victor to come out of the wardrobe,but the thunderous scream came back much more raucous.         As Elliot walked backward unconscious of what was happening,a triangular head came forward out of the window.It was the head of a dragon.      The dragon squeezed him self effortlessly through the narrow,rectangular window.His body was as flexible as dough.      Elliot gazed at the man who was perching over the dragon's back. After the man stroked the dragon's  scaly red neck smoothly, he untethered his legs from the saddle and leaped to the wooden floor.      "you weren't expecting me Elliot?"      The man gestured at the dragon with his gloved hands.The dragon flopped to the ground the wooden floor that creaked under his weight.His thorned tail writhed in circles behind him as if a living snake was fixed to his back.      Victor has nearly fainted at the sight of the dragon.He didn't whether what was happening was a part of his nightmare or real.He slapped himself several times before he decided that he was awake and gazed back through the small crack.   The voice of the man was shrill as his dragon but much colder.Victor couldn’t diverge his attention from his weird attire.A black jeans emblemed with grey skulls.A green leather coat its two sides strapped together with a lace that was stuffed with all kinds of knives and pointy ,short stacks.The diverse collection seemed similar to that of a surgent.His face was long,Full of scars,and lifeless.       "Where's the griffin crow"      "what griffin Morphew"      Elliot moved toward Morphew.      "not again Crow you know what I'm speaking about.I know that Fyrfax isn't dead"      Elliot's eyes widened at these words. How could Morphew Know about his plan? How could he divulge the secret of the griffin.T he secret that he worked on fabricating for the last two years. Everyone believed that the

I have enjoyed fantasy and sci-fi, but am open to anything, and am trying to find a good list of books to read (the larger the better).  I don't mind long or difficult books (I also want to improve my vocabulary)       I would be particularly interested in what some dark fantasy titles are.
20090307145540AACfqmV	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What are some Interesting Books?	I haven't been reading for awhile, and am trying to get into it again.  I find that I haven't read a large variety of books, and am looking for some more interesting/enlightening/obscure titles.        I'm looking for a large list of potential books so I can explore different genres and authors.  I would also like to explore more fantasy novels, including dark fantasy (but would rather not look at the more mainstream, i.e. twilight.).          Please list as many books as you can think of, in whatever genre.
20090307135518AApG1i3	Arts & Humanities;Theater & Acting	America's Got Talent Question,  PLEASE HELP!?	So, my dad and I just RSVPed for me to go audition for AGT in NYC next week, which at first, and still am, really excited about.   but the thing is, would an agent sign me even if I don't win, or get accepted into any of the rounds. Can I still pursue my dreams of singing/acting/and a little dance (ok lets just say performing), even if I'm not the "million-dollar winner" ?

20090307150136AAIoTmE	Arts & Humanities;History	Where is good information about Henry VIII?	I need to write an internal monologue about Henry VIII. The definition of an internal monologue according to my assignment is:      One character talking to themselves about themselves; it includes thoughts as well as sensory impressions. It is as though the reader is overhearing the stream of thoughts and feelings in the characters mind.      In my own words, it's a monologue including personal feelings of a specific event. Feelings that one would say to themselves.       For example: My friend framed me for stealing my teacher's grade-book and changing my grades. Now I'm frustrated and talking to myself mad at this friend. I'd be expressing my personal feelings.      For my project, I want to write about the moments before death. But I can't find decent sources.       Can you please help me find websites about Henry VIII?

I can never write correctly if I'm writing on the internet,on the computer,or for someone..:      "What a beautiful town.   Warm weather in the spring. Mildly hot summer days. Breezy autumn afternoons. Cool winter days. Clear white snow in the winter. Auburn and yellow leaves in autumn. Dark green grass and leaves all spring and summer...How cliche is that?   This town is too perfect,too happy. Everyone's happy all year long,everyone knows each other. This town needs something odd,something freaky. Something unique..I wish someone would come and change that all. Sometimes,I just wish someone would go and take me away from this town forever. "      ...See,it's not good enough.

20090307152823AAeHEUe	Arts & Humanities;History	Do you think that you might act like the Robert Ford did?	..He was ashamed of his boasting, his pretension of courage and ruthlessness.   He was sorry about his cold-bloodedness, dispassion, his inability to express what he now believed was the case, that he truly regretted  killing Jesse, that he missed the man as much as anybody.   And wished his murder hadn’t been necessary.   He knew that the smiles disappeared when he passed by.   The would be no eulogies for Bob, no photographs of his body would be sold in sundries stores, no biographies would be written about him, no children named after him, no one would ever pay 25 cents to stay in the rooms he grew up in.   The shotgun would ignite and Ella Mae would scream. But Robert Ford would only lay on the floor and look at the ceiling, the light going out of his eyes before he could find the right words.

The feeling of dread was all around ‘Hershey Lane’ a little, town? on the outskirts of London, the kind of place where you feel uneasy to drive round and no one is ever in sight, We drove through and their was no one in sight, no one, at all, a ghosttown. One small house had a light on, it did’nt feel right but i had to do it to get home, i knocked. A plump old man opened the door, he glared me up and down and groaned ‘Can i help you?’ i felt uneasy and answered him my voice stuttured until i gained total control of my shaking and anxiety. ‘Yes, do you know the way to Grittle Forest?’ i stood up straight and looked into his house, he was very clean and i could hear dogs whimpering in the background. He pointed and murmured ‘South until you hit the M84, then go east’ He slammed the door so hard that his house shaked. I ran down the path into my mums car ‘Where did he say to go then sweetie?’ i replied to the co-ordinates he told me, my mum was a weird woman at times, shes a skinny figure who wears too much blusher and eyeshadow and heels the size of mount everest.

I don't have a title yet so if you can think if one it would really help.   epilogue   Goodbyes:   She remembered it vividly, the day her father had left. He was going off to war the year was 2010 and she was only 11 years old. She was dreaming of that day now. Her father was packing in his room when she had walked in. She was worried, "Where are you going?" she asked nervously. "I'm going away for a little while Alexandra," he hesitated, "I won't be gone for long." He knew that this wasn't true. Later that day Lexi was walking to the kitchen when she heard voices so she stopped and listened. Her father was talking to her mother, "Mary, if something goes wrong you will be safe I have made a shelter for you under the shed," he had said. He was a scientist and had heard that the countries they where at war with had a nuclear bomb and where going to use it soon. "Under the shelf in the shed there is a metal dooe, under that door is a room. I have created a way to make sure that only clean air can  get inust in case. There are rooms for each of you, and food to last for many years to come. You, Anna, Lexi, and Brendan will be safe. You must not tell anyone, once you are in you can not open the door again." Lexi didn't understand, and was scared. She quickly ran p to her room so they wouldnt know she had heard. That night their goodbyes were said. Brendan, Lexi's 5 year old brotherdidn't understand what was going on and was very cheerful. "Lexi," her father said I promise I will come back. Maybe not tomorrow, the next day , or the nextbut I promise that I will return no matter what. Goodbye Lexi." Lexi was jolted awake her mother was shaking her violently. "What's going on?" Lexi asked. Her mother looked horrified. "Go get your brother and meet me by the back door." her mother said and ran out of the room. Lexi disn't question her mother, she ran to now 7 year old brother Brendans room woke him up and dragged him to ther front door.         I hope you like it so far. Don't be afraid to say it sucks. I just want your opinion. If people like it I'm gonna keep writing if not then I'll just toss it and start a new one.      Thanks?

20090307141954AAaq1fc	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Could someone proof read this for me?	We were at the drive thru of McDonald's to pick up an order I had made so I could rid myself of the hunger that had accumilated over the day. In order to break the silence while waiting I attempted to make a couple of jokes. As planned, I made her laugh and that had made me feel less uptight and comfortable. Feeling the tension of new found frienship disappear she opened up and mentioned how much she loved hanging out with my sister and how great she is. I asked her, "Have you ever lived with her?" She glanced over with a bewildered look on her face waiting for an answer. To which I said, "Then you don't know the suffering my family and myself have been through." As bad as it was bashing on my sister; she laughed. She then drove up to the pick-up window to receive the order and she looked over to me and asked, "Are you a 'sensitive' guy?" I chuckled and asked her, "Why?" She responded, "Because they're always the ones hurt and left behind." I leaned my head back and looked back at how I've handled all past relations with crushes I've had. All to which I had no success. She continued with, "Don't be that guy. It's not worth it." So then at that moment I said to myself, "Alright." Change the way you're going to define yourself and exclude senstivity from it all. All other relative meanings or descriptions of the word as well. Now to this day. I haven't been able to do that. As easy as I made it sound. Discovering this, I halted any future attempts to change who I am. I guess I'll have to deal with everything as I always have: based almost strictly on feelings and emotions. Including those of others I care and hold near. I just hope in the long run. It doesn't affect my success. Because then. I'll look at myself in the mirror like a complete **** of a mess.

I have a project where I have to make a video in iMovie to a recording of a poem. My poem is "Spirits of the Dead" by Edgar Allan Poe. I need pictures (from Google) to depict the poem.

20090307145004AATSNYw	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Your Opinion On My New Story?	Chapter 1 - First Day      Stop it Stop it I keep thinking to my self What did I did to her.    It was my fault my stupid fault why did I had to be so selfish.   I hate it I hate my self and never would try my nice, sweet, beutiful neas I love her with all my hearth and dont want anything to happen to her again.   I first woke up with this nightmare that chilled me to the bone I was in a dark no lights tunnel and at the very edge was this light I went in and found my self in this amazing place was full with everything the grass bright as green, sparkling water, cabins which were made of wood, and my favorite a beach.   I was next to my neas the one I never would let go and whispered to my ear   "Dont be sad" Emely whispered   I kept silence and Emely my neas started walking forward   "Coming" she whispered   "Where" I replied   "Are you coming" She sounded a little annoyed   I started walking when two wolfs came from nowhere the clouds turned black red and lighting started coming from above the moutains my perfect dream to my worse nightmare I had have. There were two wolves straight ahead and Emely nowhere to be seen. The wolves charged me and I moved a side and lucky me only had a bleeding arm.   "Emely were are you" I screamed with a hard hurt scream   "RUNAWAY" she kept silence I still wondering were she was "HURRY ........"   Were to run to the spooky forest or trew the lava river   When the two wolves started chargin to me again.   Before they both attacked me I woke up.
20090307145025AAz9fL3	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Harry Potter series or Twilight series?	alright so which one will be the epic masterpiece remembered 100 years from now?   My personal opinion is Harry Potter because it just has more depth, the plot is way more intricate, and the characters more dynamic. I mean I read Twilight, but nothing really stuck out. It is obviously more geared toward girls where the Harry Potter series can be aimed to everyone. Edward remains this mindless drone who struggles with love and Bella the petty girl who swoons over him. And Breaking Dawn you have to admit was basically just 900 page fan fiction.

20090307150702AAFdOIk	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of my book so far?	I asked the same question yesterday, but I added more.    “Codie… psst Codie…Codie…CODIE!” my best friend Ainsley shout-whispered into my ear trying to get me to wake-up before my teacher Mr. Fay saw me sleeping.     “Wha?” I said in that just woken up why am I not in my bed mode.     “Codie the movie is over,” Ainsley said.    “Oh,” I said dumbly. “I swear those movies get more and more boring every time.”     “I know right,” said my other best friend Ella , who was walking over towards me and Ainsley.     Right now ‘I know right’ was Ella’s catch phrase.    “When are you going to stop saying that?” I complained to Ella.    “When you stop constantly playing with your hair.”    “Touché,” I responded back.     “Simmer down you two,” Ainsley said trying to keep the peace.     “She started it,” Ella said.    “I know right,” I said in a mock-ish tone.     “You guys chillax!”     There was an awkward silence after that, which Mr. Fay broke.     “You may leave,” he said.     Ainsley, Ella, and I headed towards our lockers. We got lucky this year since we are all in the same homeroom, unlike last year in sixth grade when all of my ex-friends where all in the same homeroom and I wasn’t, which was a big deal, as you can probably see with the ex in ex-friends. Sometimes I wonder why I was ever friends with those attention seeking Paris Hilton wannabes.     “Hey Code, Ella is coming over my house you wanna come too?” Ainsley asked me, forcing me to come out of my trance.     “Oh no thanks I have to watch my younger brother tonight,” I responded.    “Isn’t Brent like ten?”    “Yeah, but my mom is paranoid that he would burn the house down… and probably for good reasons.”     “Why can’t Doug watch him – Brent loves Doug!” Ainsley said obviously not seeing how that statement could be offensive to me.     “Because Brent and Doug together will for sure end up in the house being burnt down.”    Brent and Doug are my two brothers, Brent ten (as Ainsley pointed out) and Doug is fifteen.      “Okay well call me if you change your mind,” she chuckled out.    “’Kay bye.”     “Bye,” she called back as she walked away.     I put my history book and parent teacher conferences papers in my tote bag which I use as a backpack.     When I got on my bus I sat in my usual seat in the back. I set my tote/backpack next to me so nobody would ask to sit next to me, and got my history homework out.       1. What was the beginning of the Revolutionary War?       The shot heard around the world in Lexington and Concord      2. How long was the Revolutionary War?        8 years      3. Who was George Washington?        He was a gener-        “Can I sit next to you?” a little blond sixth grade girl asked me, rudely interrupting me from my homework.     “Um… no,” I said abruptly     “But there’s no where else to sit!”    “That’s your problem not mine!”    “She’s sittin’ with ya!” my bus driver Ms. Stalls who I’m pretty sure hates me said over that bus microphone thing.     I rolled my eyes and moved my bag onto my lap.    “I’m Leighton,” the girl said.    “I don’t care.”    “Well I would if I where you because some day I’m going to be a famous model,” Leighton said.    “Don’t you have to be um… tall to be a model,” I was going to say attractive but I decided that would be way out of line, and she wasn’t ugly.    “Well I’m only twelve and I’m already five foot four!” which I wouldn’t admit to her, but is two inches tall than me.    “Hey Codie hanging out with sixth graders now?” asked Chance  “I guess that wouldn’t surprise me that your picking less popular friends, since you ditched Zoe and all of them.”    “Shut up Chance, and don’t even try to understand what happened between me and Zoe,” I said.     If it is not already obviously enough, I hate Chance and everything about him. I even hated him when I used to hang out with him, but I pretended that I didn’t mind him, when he was going out with my ex-friend Livy – and let’s just say I threw a party for Livy when she and Chance broke up.    “Oh looks like someone is a little feisty… me-ow,” Chance said in a failed attempt to be funny.    “Hey you in the back with the white hat on, SIT DOWN!” Ms. Stalls commanded Chance.     You see the thing with Chance is that he acts all bad boy, but he would never do anything that would cause him serious trouble in his life. I’m pretty sure he’s never even had a detention.
