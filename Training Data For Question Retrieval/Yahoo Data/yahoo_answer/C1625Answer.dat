The Tree is put up on or around the same time, and the official lighting occurs the first week of December.  It's actually RARELY on a weekend however - it was a Tuesday this year, and last year was the same.

The nearest streets where you can park on a Sunday are St Giles Street on the opposite side of the road from the Cathedral or Cockburn Street just off the High Street. It all depends on what time in the moning you're planning to go. <br>  You might have to park in Johnstone Terrace, the South Bridge or Hunter Square.|`|zgTsCicNaa	Park in Chambers Street, about a 5 minute walk from the cathedral. there are no parking restrictions on Sunday & the meters are free.<br>  <br>  There is a public car park on Castle Terrace which is down a steep hill, approximately a 25 minute walk to St Giles'.<br>  <br>  There are no parking facilities at the cathedral.<br>  <br>  Many buses travel to South Bridge and the cathedral is a 5-10 minute walk from there.

They will accept bids on competitive routes and  off peak travel times that are not likely to sell out. <br>  <br>  Like a flight from New York to Orlando during spring break for the kids is a route that you are unlikely to get a bargain.    But that same trip in mid October should yield you some bargains. <br>  <br>  Also, keep in mind that with airlines, priceline makes you accept flights at any time of the day, so you could conceivably lose 1 or two days of vacation if they make you take the outbound late flight and the early flight on your return.<br>  For that reason, I only use priceline for hotel stays and car rentals (not flights)|`|SsB7aRExaa	There is one sure fire, guaranteed strategy:<br>  <br>  Bid higher.|`|ByVkqiSCaa	best way to get a good deal is to adjust your flight days to leave on odd days (such as in on thursday out saturday/monday), the off-peak flights will be cheaper

You can go tubing, snorkeling, snuba diving, scuba diving, windsurfing and a lot of other fun water sports.  It is a once in a lifetime experience that you can't miss.  They also have a natural bridge that is great to take pictures on top of.  Please trust me...you'll LOVE aruba.|`|MVVQrEasaa	Where are you traveling from?  All will be warm, sunny places with beach time and tasty seafood to eat.<br>  <br>  It is a bit "easier" going to Hawaii because it's part of the US - no passport required, though most caribbean countries take US dollars, it's obviously the currency in Hawaii.  But it won't be a big hassle to get a passport for travel to the Caribbean.<br>  <br>  If you are traveling from the east coast, I'd go to the Caribbean first.  If you are travelling from the west coast, then go to Hawaii. The flight isn't as long and though the culture will be different (obviously) the experiences will be similar.|`|p1yIVINraa	Hawaii or Jamaica, both are totally different cultures than in middle america, and are totally awesome to stop at.  Though Hawaii can be fun to do the total tourist thing at, and Jamaica can be a little slow-paced so choose according to your tastes.  Both have excellent beaches (as do all four) but both are also the most friendly with different things to do.<br>  <br>  Aruba is good if you want to just relax and do the whole beach and water related thing, and Puerto Rico ... well I can't say anything against it, but I also can't say anything for it.  It's not top on most travelers lists.|`|AtG2OqdOaa	I've been to Jamaica and Puerto Rico and they were both really nice.

f2959c3466eb9458fc5521de90e563d3aa	Manhattanite/Yuppie/hipster infestations. People with money driving the regular people who created the neighborhood out. Gentrification = death to a neighborhood. Dry cleaners, bodegas, corner shops and shoe repair places become overpriced bistros and boutiques selling useless things no one needs. Regular bars become "hip" dive bars. Etc...<br>  <br>  The same thing happened to the lower east side, which used to be an actual neighborhood with personality but is now full of rich people and stores.<br>  <br>  Eura is right, especially about Bay Ridge. Bay Ridge is just normal. Bed Stuy is better than it used to be, but "real"?...no. It's just a bad neighborhood. Maybe real is supposed to mean rough? I agree that these are terms New Yorkers don't really use.|`|FKxrJxbPaa	people dont typically say real vs fake unless theyre a gentrifying hipster....this is because they LITERALLY go around looking for run down gritty neighborhoods to colonise and gentrify (they go to thrift shops on PURPOSE just for the irony....f*ckin pathetic). Once too many of them get to an area, they then decide to call in "fake" and move on, etc. <br>  <br>  But basically "real" Brooklyn is the parts where this terrible trend hasn't occured, where people can still get a slice for less than 2$, where the Jamaican bakeries, roti shops, corner bodegas, 99cent stores & mom&pop italian restaurants outnumber the Bistros, "Fusion" restaurants, "lounges" and f*ckin gay @ss hippie stores.|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	I'm with Eura on this one.  Nobody from Brooklyn uses these terms.  And I think she's got it right about someone mistakenly confusing "crappy" with "real."  <br>  Maybe this is kind of like the expression "New York minute."  People in New York don't say that, either.|`|1d718ff96585004e8d1e8bc312c3655daa	I haven't a clue what you're talking about and I've never heard of this in my ENTIRE life - having been born and raised in various parts of Brooklyn, I was under the impression that Brooklyn is Brooklyn and that's it.  I lived in Bay Ridge, Brighton Beach, Midwood, Bensonhurst - they all seemed pretty "real" to me.  <br>  <br>  I think you're confusing the word "crappy" with the word "real."  There's nothing real about Bed-Stuy - it's run-down, and nobody CHOOSES to live there, they simply do because it's cheap and their circumstances are unfortunate and they can't move despite the elevated crime rates Bed-Stuy experiences compared to the rest of Brooklyn.  <br>  <br>  Red Hook and Park Slope (not to mention Greenpoint and Williamsburg) have become ritzy, trendy and expensive.  I wouldn't live there if you paid me - I feel like they've become extensions of Manhattan.  When I was around 6 or 7, around 15 years ago, and my family and I emigrated here from Eastern Europe, those areas, Red Hook in particular, weren't even close to the shape they're in today.  I can't remember which mayor or politician referred to it as the "crack capital of America," lol.  It's clearly cleaned up a lot.  It's still Brooklyn, though, and it's neither real nor fake.<br>  <br>  I can't imagine why you would even include Bay Ridge in that mix - it's mostly made up of Russian and Jews.  That's what Brooklyn IS nowadays, diverse and culturally adept - making it the most real area I could imagine.|`|h8OqX12Haa	i have no idea what you mean but most parts of brooklyn are really safe nad they can get expensive just like manhattan i came here to NY about 5 years ago and the first place that i lived was greenpoint which at that time wasnt so expensive my parents were renting an apartment for 750$ it was a 2 bedroom apt.   but now greenpoint and williamsburg are really expensive just like manhattan  i live in queens right now but i am thinking about moving out|`|6qGHT77Raa	fake brooklyn means the places that have been gentrified.<br>  real brooklyn means the real deal..tough & gritty.|`|9MVzoSCHaa	My definition: <br>  <br>  Real Brooklyn is made up of the people who were born and raised here. People who understand that neighborhoods are meant to be ethnic enclaves (even if the ethnicity changes over time). It is a family place, sometimes extended family. It is loud with the sounds of kids playing in the street and parents screaming down the block that it is time to come home for dinner or homework or whatever. It is kids who go to the public school down the street. Or maybe Catholic School / Yeshiva. The fruit stand on the corner is not organic and doesn't care. The 99 cent store is a staple. It is neighbors sitting on their porches or stoops talking about the important stuff in each others lives.<br>  Real Brooklyn is community.<br>  <br>  Fake Brooklyn is where the people who live there are doing so because they can't afford Manhattan. The supermarket is now an organic co-op or something. People send their kids to private school not for religious reasons but because it is "the best" They live in new condo conversions. They ride bicycles to get around. <br>  <br>  Real vs. Fake is not a physical place - although some neighborhoods do skew more one way than another - but rather a way of being.|`|7Y2jmO7Taa	Some people are very parochial and cannot stand change. Therefore, they denigrate the parts of Brooklyn that have changed the most in the past few decades, calling those parts "fake."<br>  <br>  It's all nonsense!<br>  <br>  NYC is about change. If people can't handle change, they are not New Yorkers!

Find a travel medicine clinic near you. If you have a medical condition, you should also share your travel plans with any doctors you are currently seeing for other medical reasons.<br>  <br>  If your travel plans will take you to more than one country during a single trip, be sure to let your health-care provider know so that you can receive the appropriate vaccinations and information for all of your destinations. Long-term travelers, such as those who plan to work or study abroad, may also need additional vaccinations as required by their employer or school.<br>  <br>  Although yellow fever is not a disease risk in Egypt, the government requires travelers arriving from countries where yellow fever is present to present proof of yellow fever vaccination. If you will be traveling to one of these countries where yellow fever is present before arriving in Egypt, this requirement must be taken into consideration.

Because the mobile network systems in S.Korea is diffrent from India. Usually Korean mobile phones don't use any SIM card. And there is NO pre-paid service. I'm a Korean. I also bought another mobile phone in India. You also need to buy a mobile phone in Korea.|`|AsgL2WlKaa	The network in Korea is completely different. Your phone will lose service once you land. Most companies in the US, charge extra money to cancel contract. So what I did was took everything off my phone, text, internet and blocked everything and stayed on the basic $10 phone contract. It might be cheaper that way and let your contract end on its own. Also cell phones don't hold numbers so if you like your number then I would recommend just paying the 10 a month. Getting a phone in Korea is great... there are many companies and you can pay about 20,000 won a month or less... just get a pay as you go phone. And buy a calling card to call people in the states the cheapest way when using your Korean Cell phone. <br>  Skype is amazing so check it out if you don't know what it is... skype.com and set up family and friends with it before you leave.|`|AA11043633	Check with your network provider if you can use your mobile phone over there.  But it would be more practical to just get one there if you are going to stay for good so as not to bother you paying your bill in other place.

HLqzrBNmaa	They have a foot fettish.|`|48846255239e6cfd4e8b805cbae9c844aa	I have no clue, but alot of foreign cultures are weird about the feet.  In the middle east when you cross your legs, you dont want to expose the bottom of your foot to someone they find it offensive.  when they knocked down the statues of Saddam the people took off thier shoes and hit the statue with it as an insult, and that guy that threw his shoe at Bush a few months ago, Im sure using his shoe was intended to add insult to injury.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	Many cultures feel the feet and mainly the soles of your shoes as rude and an insult. When that journalist tossed his shoes at George Bush it was not just because it was the only object he had in hand, if that were the case then a clip board would have sufficed. Tossing of the shoes has great meaning in Muslim countries.During the American occupation of Somalia, a mainly Muslim country the American practise of flying over the city with their feet dangling out of the Black hawks was often taken as an insult as they showed the soles of their boots, considered dirty, was like flying overhead giving every one the "bird", good old one finger salute.|`|pm2EeEgiaa	Most Asian cultures have a thing about pointing the foot, especially in South-East Asia, so be careful in using your feet there, especially in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Burma.|`|Qxqvr97maa	Yes it is considered impolite.

fQJ1YQugaa	1) It is not just women, but men, children, elderly...all do shave their head. There is a temple in South India at Pazhani where one of the main offerings to God is the offering of one's hair. Devotees offer their hair to fulfil their wishes or to thank God for their blessings. So you are right in your assumption that its part of the religion. Is not mandatory to do so...just one's own belief and wish. Due to the location of the temple... south india, there are more devotees in this region and hence it could be said its "people from south india". however there are people from other partts of india too who come to this temple and give their offerings.<br>  <br>  2) Long hair is considered as mark of beauty in India and hence usually girls and women love to grow their hair long. As a result they take a lot of care for their hair to make it strong and healthy , thereby preventing hairfall and brittleness which may force them to cut it short. Women who love to grow long hair go for an occasional trim of the hair so that hair looks even and good at the ends. So it is not that they donot cut their hair. Also you can find women all over India with long hair...not just the south. Again, its not all women grown their hair long. More modern women do wear their hair to medium and short lengths too|`|1tmWiaQjaa	i haven't seen or heard about that!!!!!!!!! I think that is a wrong information<br>  <br>  many women has long hair because they keep their hair always clean and use natural methods for the protection of their hair rather than synthetic stuff(shampoos, hair colors......)<br>  Some use the juice of hibiscus leaves. Also hot oil....etc|`|YW74O9aNaa	In southern India, there is a temple where devotees donate their hair as an offering. This is where everyone kids, men women shave their heads. Its a religious thing , nothing out of despratation! :D <br>  <br>  There is nothing special in the genetics , may be just the dark black hair colour. But Indian women have healthy hair because the Indian women do not colour/bleach/perm/iron hair. May be celebrities and such do sometimes but average indian women do not go for such things. Even use of hair dryer is not common, due to the hot climate hair just air dries fast. All this prevents damage to the hair. Less brittleness, less split ends, this make trimming un-necessary. Thats why they don't have to cut hair every few weeks and hair grows longer quicker. <br>  <br>  Also weekly hair and scalp massage with warm coconut oil is also a norm, that ensures better circulation and healthier hair.|`|7h4stNstaa	i dunno about the first one but the second one is easy,it s just genetics,and they dont usually cut their hair
2EVoNHHbaa	The National Zoo is a 15-20 minute drive from Arlington Cemetery during non-rush hours.  <br>  <br>  The National Zoo is located in Washington, DC, specifically in the upper Northwest section.  Arlington Cemetery is located across the Potomac River from DC, in Arlington, Virginia.<br>  <br>  You can also take the Metro subway between the two, although that will take somewhat longer, and will require a change of trains and a 10 minute walk from Metro to the zoo.|`|5CRXkxksaa	From Arlington cemetery using the metro it takes about 30 minutes.

I hope it's because I'm always careful to be kind and tell them the truth.<br>  It's a mutual respect.<br>  If a Westerner can afford to be here they have to have met with some financial security in their life and usually or self sustained.<br>  Success of any kind is admired and hopefully emulated.  To be wise walk with the wise.<br>  It's not so much a he's a westerner as he is successful and that could apply to anyone.<br>  I don't think Philippino's look down on other Asians.  A lot admire Japan and some China.  Singapore is still popular to travel to.<br>  Koreans are often called rude and bad mannered.  They still frequent their businesses though.<br>  For the most part the Pinoy is just about the friendliest and warmest greeter on earth.<br>  I don't see this.|`|z5fFoTMBaa	I only look up to them because they (Westerners) are taller.

E8LgRKHmaa	I think they must be using purple onions. They are very common in the Yucatan, and people like them because their flavor is milder than white onions. If the purple onions are left in liquid enough time, they usually lose their color, becoming whiter, and the liquid gets its purplish color. The onions in taco stands throughout Mexico are prepared in different ways.<br>  One of the most common is bringing vinegar to a boil, turning off the heat and adding the sliced onions, salt and oregano (optional), and letting it sit until the onions are soft. When prepared this way, purple onions tend to discolor. If you are positive they are using white onions, they must be reusing the liquid or adding some purple onions for their color and flavor.<br>  In Yucatan onions are also served in sour orange juice (naranja agria), or part normal orange juice and part vinegar.<br>  I hope this helps.|`|94jcEgiwaa	Purple onion salsa is more common in yucatan peninsula.<br>  <br>  Usually the recipe goes like this<br>  <br>  Purple onion, habanero chile and sour orange (naranja agria).<br>  <br>  The sour orange is harder to find if you are not in the yucatan peninlusa, some people use limon instead. <br>  <br>  That′s where the liquid comer from.<br>  <br>  Oh, and a dash of salt.|`|x79VCZsNaa	No they are not white onions but purple and  become white because in order to prepare them for BBQ chicken or cochinita pibil tacos people slice the purple onion then put the onion in hot watter for some minuts to soft them afther that they add vinegar and spices and at the end sugar, when you add sugar to the onion with vinegar inmediatly the color of the onion comes out and the onion become almost transparent.

9DWkChf6aa	Definitely find a job first. The market is not what it was last summer, and your address will not make a difference on your application.<br>  <br>  As an example, my company has had several vacancies that they've been trying to fill for some time, but are now under a hiring freeze. Many others are experiencing layoffs. <br>  <br>  While the economy will rebound, it will take time. Don't spend the money to make a big move if you cant find a job.|`|azypqsphaa	u shd try to find a job first, they'll accept ur app even if ur still in ontario if u give them a date when u can start..|`|FpT7x2VVaa	I'd say your chances are the same as here. An address in CAL is not required, but be aware, housing in CAL is still not cheap. check the rental rates out first. <br>  the heydays of money being thrown at any warm body in order to entice them to come to work for an employer are gone. if you take the long term view, Alberta will rebound and based on oil and gas, will do well again. question is, how long will it take. <br>  <br>  why not get 'your feet wet' here in ON and then make a move once you are established in your chosen field. good IT folks were always a sought after group.
48f05733ad5213c40c6efa92aa9ee2c0aa	You are correct, it is expensive.  But, I am guessing that Colorado was not that cheap either.<br>  <br>  Personally, I like to live near where I work.  The commuter traffic in NoVA is horrible.  I would highly recommend that you rent first...that way you can look around, get a feel for the area and ask MANY people what the pros and cons are for the different areas.<br>  <br>  I used to live in Chantilly and Sterling areas.  They are right on Rt. 28, the main corridore that runs past Dulles Airport.<br>  <br>  They are predicting that housing prices will continue to DECLINE in 2009 for the Metro DC area, so waiting might be a good thing.|`|4VzVfKvdaa	You get what you pay for in this area.  I live right near where you work and I pay $1500 a month.  However, for that money, I get a free gym, pool, tennis courts, 1200 sq ft and a fireplace.  Most places this size go for nearly twice that in this area.  With the downturn in the economy, you may be able to get some good deals on rentals because people need to pay their mortgages on those properties.  Also, as the job market has gotten tight, people can't afford where I live and if it is a 2 income family, they have to move to a cheaper place...leaving many vacant apartments.  When I first moved here, there was a $300 finders fee for new tenants.  now there is a $500 finders fee.  That being said, I would check out Herndon, Reston, Sterling (some parts of it), Ashburn, Chantilly, Fairfax, or Centreville.  Also, when using apartment finders for this area and you see a place that seems really cheap, it is usually for people on fixed incomes.  They have a maximum income that you can have based on family size before you can rent there.  For example, a family of 6 needs to make less than $60K a year to rent some places...and they are really nice places.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.herndon-va.gov/" rel="nofollow">http://www.herndon-va.gov/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.city-data.com/city/Chantilly-Virginia.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.city-data.com/city/Chantilly-...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ashburnweb.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ashburnweb.com/</a>|`|2EVoNHHbaa	Communities to take a look at include Reston, Herndon, Chantilly, and Ashburn.  All would fit where you will be working.<br>  <br>  Reston is a planned community built primarily in the 1970s and 1980s.  I know that they have numerous rental units to offer.<br>  <br>  Given the downturn in the housing market, you might also be able to rent a house for not that much more than you would normally pay to rent an apartment.  Some sellers would be willing to consider renting.|`|9fCjtbfaaa	I live in Burke and work in Chantilly.  It takes me 20-30 minutes most days but it's worth it.

Traffic can be a huge pain and it's worth it (to me) to live where I work. I agree that it might be a good idea to rent short term and look around first. <br>  Archstone Apts are nice complexes, and rent from $1000 to $1800. <br>  <a href="http://www.archstoneapartments.com/Search_Results.htm?state=VA&market=103" rel="nofollow">http://www.archstoneapartments.com/Searc...</a><br>  <br>  One great thing about Reston is it's dedication to green space.

(www.neworleanscitypark.com).<br>  <br>  Mardi Gras and the Jazz Festival are world famous events, but New Orleans hosts many festivals and celebrations throughout the year:  www.nola.com/festivals<br>  <br>  The Saint Charles Streetcar is the oldest continuously operating street railway in the world and is a "tourist attraction" in its own right.  It is part of the public transit system, as are the Canal Street and Riverfront streetcar lines:  www.norta.com<br>  <br>  Wander around the French Quarter, enjoy the architecture, watch the street entertainers (do tip), and visit some of the historic buildings that have been turned into museums (go to www.frenchquarter.com and click on Historic Attractions).<br>  <br>  Assuming the weather is good, you can collect a sandwich lunch and eat in the riverfront park (watch the shipping) or in Jackson Square (a very nice park). <br>  <br>  The Riverwalk shopping center has an air-conditioned food court with dining overlooking the river (www.riverwalkmarketplace.com).  The Canal Place shopping center is in the French Quarter and has a cinema and higher-end shopping (Saks 5th Avenue, Brooks Brothers, etc.).  Magazine Street is a miles-long shopping district: www.magazinestreet.com<br>  <br>  Louisiana is the only US state that offers tax-free shopping for international visitors:  <a href="http://www.louisianataxfree.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.louisianataxfree.com/</a><br>  <br>  The lobby for the Westin Canal Place Hotel is on the 11th floor and overlooks the French Quarter. It is a great place for an afternoon drink/snack:(www.westin.com).<br>  <br>  Cafe du Monde is in the French Quarter and you shouldn't miss having cafe au lait & beignets (www.cafedumonde.com). Another great coffee shop is the Croissant d'Or (at 615 Ursulines Street), which is open from 7:00am to 2:00pm and has food in addition to pastry. <br>  <br>  Preservation Hall has traditional live Jazz, and doesn’t serve alcohol so all ages are welcome:  www.preservationhall.com<br>  <br>  The Palm Court restaurant is very nice, has moderate prices, and offers traditional live jazz starting at 8:00pm: 1204 Decatur Street, tel 504-525-0200 (reservations are important and they are not open every day). The Palm Court is closed from about July 25th to about September 25th each year.<br>  <br>  Maximo's Italian Grill has great food and atmosphere: 1117 Decatur Street in the French Quarter, (504) 586-8883.<br>  <br>  All of the famous restaurants (Antoine's, Arnaud's, Brennan's, Commander's Palace, etc.) have reopened. The Pelican Club (on Exchange Alley in the FQ) is not as well known but is the same type experience. Reservations are a good idea, and probably essential on weekends.  Tujaques Restaurant (823 Decatur Street) is very traditional and has moderate prices:  www.tujaguesrestaurant.com<br>  <br>  Cafe Degas is a very French restaurant near City Park at 3127 Esplanade - which is not within walking distance of downtown (5 to 10 minutes by taxi). They are closed on Mondays & Tuesdays (504-945-5635).<br>  <br>  The Napoleon House restaurant is at 500 Chartres Street in the FQ, and has a menu of great local dishes:  www.napoleonhouse.com<br>  <br>  New Orleans has ballet, opera, a symphony orchestra, and theatre: <br>  <br>  www.nobadance.com<br>  www.neworleansopera.org<br>  www.lpomusic.com<br>  www.lepetittheatre.com<br>  <br>  There is a free ferry across the Mississippi at the "foot" of Canal Street. It is a short trip but like a harbor cruise w/o a guide: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canal_street_ferry" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canal_stree...</a><br>  <br>  The Aquarium, Audubon Zoo, and the new Insectarium are world-class attractions (www.auduboninstitute.org) and you should see them if you can. The Zoo is several miles from downtown. You can drive to the Zoo (which has free parking) or take public transit from the French Quarter.<br>  <br>  The Louisiana State Museum is in the French Quarter:  <a href="http://lsm.crt.state.la.us/" rel="nofollow">http://lsm.crt.state.la.us/</a>  New Orleans is also home to a number of other museums, such as the National World War II Museum (www.ddaymuseum.org) and the New Orleans Museum of Art (www.noma.org). Both can be reached by public transit: The WWII museum is in the central business district but a long walk from the French Quarter. NOMA is not within walking distance of downtown but has free parking.

(they get a wrist-band so the staff knows they are an adult). <br>  <br>  Note that music clubs often advertise "No Cover", meaning there is no charge for entering. However, clubs with "No Cover" often require that customers buy a beverage (doesn't have to be alcohol) each for every "set " of music (which can be every 20 minutes) so KNOW THE PRICE before you sit down. Clubs do that because some people will sit in the club all evening drinking nothing (clubs only make money from the drinks they sell - not from the music). It is also a good idea to pay for each round of drinks (in clubs on Bourbon Street) as it is delivered so there can't be any confusion at the end of the evening.<br>  <br>  An incomplete guide to bars & clubs:   www.neworleanscheapdrinks.com<br>  <br>  About certain alcoholic beverages:  Realize that some famous drinks are VERY potent compared with regular cocktails that have only 1 to 1 ? ounces of alcohol. For example, a Hurricane is basically 3 or 4 ounces of rum in something like red Kool-Aid, and a Hand Grenade has at least 4 ? ounces of Everclear + rum + vodka mixed with melon liquor.  They don’t necessarily taste like an alcoholic beverage and it is easy to over-indulge.<br>  <br>  Harrah’s Casino is in the Central Business District: www.harrahs.com  (age 21 required for entry)<br>  <br>  Hope you have a great time!|`|Tc7MEnxZaa	first of all we're glad u picked new orleans instead of the steretyped florida beach..... um if your sportsfans definetely go to a hornets game... take a ferry on the mississippi river, visit the audobon zoo and aquarium... dont miss out on the french quarter and all the new orleans culture it carries... one last thing, if u want to show them the not so nice areas such as the lower 9th ward and other areas that were really hit hard by the storm... we want people to know that not everything is ok yet and we really need funding from the govt.... good luck!

If they can't, you're entitled to compensation (50 days in the first case, the duration of the pregnancy in the 2nd).<br>  <br>  You get a bonus (j?mst?lldhetsbonusen) in child benefits if the mother and father share leave more equally. This is to promote the father taking more than the minimum paternal leave.<br>  <br>  You have the right to take 100% work leave (and still have your job guaranteed) until your child is 1.5 years old. You can work shorter days (-25%) until your child is 8. <br>  <br>  In the case of joint custody, each parent is given the possibility of 240 days paid parental leave, with a 60-day enforced minimum (each parent must take at least 60 days off). A parent with sole custody gets 480 days, and if you have twins you get an extra 180 days. <br>  <br>  The compensation for parental leave is the same as sick leave, or just under 80% of your normal salary, for 390 of the days. If you haven't worked enough during the previous year to receive this, there is a base level of benefit (180kr per day minimum) you are still eligible for.

Saipan is its' capital and largest town of Northern Marianas; Hagatna is its' counterpart in Guam.<br>  3. Filipinos make up the largest ethnic group in the Northern Mariana Islands, and the second largest ethnic group in Guam, where they are overtaken by the indigenous Chamorros.<br>  4. The Marianas Islands have been part of Spanish (and Philippine), German, and American territories since the 1700s.<br>  5. The Spanish culture have affected the Marianas profoundly that fiestas, the Roman Catholic religion, and the words from the Spanish language are all widespread.<br>  <br>  I haven't been to Marianas Islands but I have done a lot of research about it.|`|AA10690200	Hafa Adai!

Even if you are not going to buy anything it is class just to have a walk around.<br>  Also cinema, bowling ally, bars clubs, etc.<br>  <br>  Loads more to do in the City. Have a look.<br>  <br>  If in Mithletown in Cork it has a fabulous walk Galtie mountains.<br>  <br>  Mitchelstown Cave in Tipp, great too.<br>  <br>  <br>  In Killarney there is a great National Park.<br>  <br>  Fabulous nightlife also.

Note signs to Dingle may use word <br>  An Daingean (Native Irish) instead Dingle.<br>  <br>  If you are prone to getting lost do not rent a car.<br>  A car is the best way to get around and see all the sights do, non-the less.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|CPWrxvE5aa	Drink !!!!

It is also possible to pay in Sterling or Euros in some of the stores. Do not exchange money at hotels.

USaK4A7Oaa	I'm not sure Japan has many special challenges compared to other non-Muslim countries.  But one thing is, expect people to misunderstand  what food is halal, even if you explain it to them.  For example, if a dish doesn't actually have visible chunks of pork, in Japan most people won't consider whether or not it is made with pork products.  And it's pretty normal to use meat/fish derivatives for flavouring.  There's plenty of food you can eat, though.  And in medium-big cities, there are usually some Indian restaurants with Indian cooks who you can trust about what is halal.<br>  If dining in a group with Japanese, they'll likely pour you a drink (alcoholic) without asking.  The normal way to deal with drinks you don't want is to let them pour it, and just don't drink it.  However, they will surely understand if you tell them you don't drink.<br>  Also, people usually pour drinks for each other, not themselves, so they may wait for you to pour their drinks.|`|e7576a139b6789e59e2195c707b6c228aa	If you go to cities like Kobe and Yokohama you are sure to be able find halal food.

For Muslims, a restaurant that serves katsu means you cannot eat anything else on the menu as the utensils / pot / pan may not be 'cleaned'.

Sometimes I even see older western women not wearing abias, but modest clothes.|`|WIEH455laa	Well, let's get a few things straight. <br>  <br>  1. The "Mutawa'a" is NOT allowed to touch you, let alone hit you. That practice was extinct about 10 to 15 years ago. <br>  <br>  2. Women are NOT forces to wear a Niqab, it is a choice.

That black dress you are taking about is called Shadour, Niqab is not a must, neither it is in Islam mentioned or asking a woman to put it on unless her beauty is like an angle, hah loool I haven′t seen while I was there, I mean that such a beauty. Mutaween great you know how to spell their names. They have a job to do, They do not I may also say NEVER hit a woman or comes near her, If they see that a woman is misbehaving in the street they ask one of the Mutawaeen women to tell to behave as a muslim and not any other thing, but if she , I mean the woman never responded, then it is some thing els , still they do not hit a woman at all.<br>  Have a great day dear.|`|cypZ0ykXaa	niqab is optional in many places. specially for non-muslims therz no restriction at all here. donno whether its allowed or not, but my hubby never holds my hand in saudi. we dont know the do's & dont's of this country. we only know that we r suppose to behave decently outside of home as a muslim couple .thatz it.|`|nzwYJbEFaa	its allowed niqab is not a MUST only abayah<br>  <br>  EDIT:no niqab and hijab are not must's black is not even a must but other color abayah do draw attention but i always see colored hijabs dont worry about it if u want to hold ur hubbys hand hold it if any body says any thing say ??? ??

ZwG5aAVyaa	That's true but (there is always a 'but' isn't it? :P) it's not entirely their fault.<br>  I mean, you know how Greek tv works, when they see someone who is popular to the viewers and do a good job, they usually 'squeeze them out' as much as they can, as long they bring money to their tv stations, and then one day, they leave them, again, and try someone else.<br>  Maggira sisters (and every other entertainer) just seize the opportunities for now, 'cause they probably know as well, that sooner or later they won't be that popular anymore, but boring for the viewers instead.|`|UBNEzh0Saa	They certainly are their own biggest fans.|`|yEe3WkFCaa	Oh my gosh, thank you!

I didn't mean ..." and my friend (who's Egyptian) continued: "Sir i think the number of Egyptian smokers under 25 alone is higher than the entire population of Lebanon ... and you know it's not only cigarettes ... there's the Hookah, Bango and Weed ..." <br>  <br>  I was about to hug and kiss my friend LOL ...<br>  <br>  Frankly I wasn't bothered by what the Doctor said ...

7KyYzytbaa	1st of all .. salamtek ya basha..<br>  <br>  well , i'll just talk about myself..<br>  i believe i'm able to give this kinda love , but whenever i try to do that , i become frustrated , cuz no one really deserves , i mean these ppl who deserve such love r very rare..<br>  <br>  and for ur info , even the family unconditional love doesn't exist nowadays , or at least it's becoming extinct..<br>  <br>  <br>  may allah love  us & be pleased with us..<br>  long live Egypt..<br>  love & peace from islam..|`|9R8uYHcPaa	yes .. yes .. very much so ..<br>  <br>  i never believed it until it happened to me ..|`|1op04gcFaa	i believe with all my heart that this is possible.<br>  you see, being in a biological relation with someone does not mean that you are in an emotional relationship with that person. there are so many examples of families that have no trace of love within, that are only connected by the same blood lacking any feelings, lacking love.<br>  sometimes, some people are get very lucky and they meet a person who they love so much and for whom they would do anything. that person can be a friend, a beloved man/woman...<br>  when unconditional love is in question, blood ties do not matter. there is a higher level. what is in question are emotions, and love is never rational...|`|FNCohXNiaa	i have unconditional love for many of my friends.not just any friend, just 2 or 3 really extremely special ones.the thing that makes my love for them unconditional is that they have become to close to me that i regard them as family, and as u said it only exists within "family". so i think it might be possible :)|`|QITjQwJSaa	Your question reminds me of University offers hyahhayhhayh... <br>  <br>  Anyway, yes, i think it is possible, and that would be just great to have one in my life...<br>  <br>  Why do you still use one arm? Is it that bad?|`|hhhk499qaa	Yes it is.|`|4QGEQxy4aa	Depends of your expectations of unconditional love I suppose.  I get along with my family, but sometimes we argue.  I get along with my gf too but, again, sometimes we argue and get angry at each other.  I love my gf and my family and would hate to see anything bad happen to either of them.  Even if I broke up with my gf, I don't see how I could just stop caring about her.  Once I have seen there is good in her (as with family) I cant stop loving her just because of an argument.  <br>  <br>  In conclusion, I don't know about unconditional love, but I think it is possible to love a friend of partner to the same degree you love family|`|z7ygIzZKaa	it depends on you to make the chose
f056d290ac72e5cbfa201cdeba373b61aa	I had the same problem last year.<br>  Went to Oz on a tourist visa hoping to pick up some bar work but couldn't get anything.<br>  There is new thing in Oz where you have to complete a day's catering/service course to be accepted for bar work or waitressing. But you have to have a tax file number to do the course, which you can only get with a visa.<br>  I sent out loads of CVs and called to lots of bars and restaurants but nobody would take me on. I even tried to do babysitting and cleaning work but needed a visa for them also.<br>  The way it works over there is that if a bar employs illegal staff then the bar could get fined thousands of dollars. Anybody hiring a cleaner or babysitter can claim tax back so they only want someone legal.<br>  The only people I met working illegally were builders and even that was with people they already knew.<br>  Sorry, but best advice is to work now and save like crazy so you can enjoy your time without having to work.|`|xs2mpYjWaa	You can't come to Australia without a visa, you would at least need a tourist visa. <br>  <br>  It is ILLEGAL to work on a tourist visa, NO ONE will employ you on one.

uKWcgLLoaa	Start at the Seattle Center. Go up to the top of the Space Needle, visit the amazing displays at the Experience Music Project and the Pacific Science Center, and pick out some interesting food at the one of the food courts in the Center House. Then take the 90 minute ride on the monorail to downtown Seattle and explore Westlake Mall at the end of the line.<br>  <br>  Go to the waterfront. Browse through the large import shops on the piers or take a ferry ride across Puget Sound (30 minutes to Bainbridge Island, 60 minutes to Bremerton). If you go as a "walk on", its cheap!<br>  <br>  Walk around Pioneer Square (the "old town" area near the Seahawks and Mariners sports stadiums). There are lots of interesting galleries, shops, and restaurants. Take the Underground Tour while you're there.<br>  <br>  If you can get out of the downtown core, you might enjoy getting to know the locals by walking the 3-mile path around Green Lake (flat, paved, and easy). Or walking around the campus of the University of Washington (one of the country's largest and most beautiful.)<br>  <br>  If you're into zoos, Seattle has a good one. Woodland Park Zoo is not far from Green Lake and UW.<br>  <br>  There's also an impressive Museum of Flight near Boeing Field, and a Museum of History and Industry near UW. You can also rent kayaks and canoes near the Montlake cut, again near UW.|`|ERxADoBAaa	I have lived in Seattle my whole life and I can tell you it is an amazing city.

There are many micro brews and Winerys  in a 30 mile span.The Space Needle, Seattle Center, Science Center, Shopping and , pike place market, The water front shops and Theatre are all within walking distance or a short monorail ride.<br>  <br>  <br>  Ohhh I have a "hater"!

Have agreat time!!|`|IWGNXZrYaa	To add to what's already been said:  1) ski and snowboard at the local resorts.  There are 4 to choose from.  2) visit the "underground city" near Pioneer Square.  3) go to the hot springs; there's a free one just outside of Port Angeles on the peninsula called Olympic Hot Springs, and a resort a few miles beyond that called Sol Duc; 4) while on the peninsula, ski Hurricane Ridge so you can tell everyone you skied in the Olympics; 5) again, while on the peninsula, visit Ruby Beach which is one of the few places that have red sand; 6) go to the quarry in Monroe and rock hunt for quartz and agates; 7) check out the folk and swing dance scene; 8) see what's happening at the IMAX theater (I bought some Tibetan trecker's tea there, and I don't know anywhere else in this country you can get it); 9) check out the Sherpa restaurant and try their version of beer, called Chang; 10) go ice skating at a local rink; 11) walk / rollerblade around Green Lake and meet interesting people; 12) if you're brave, swim in a local lake; 13) take a ferry to Victoria to spend a day; 14) drive up to Vancouver, then on to Whistler/Blackcomb along the Sea to Sky Highway - the scenery there challenges even Big Sur.  That leaves you two things per day to do there.  I could go on and on.  Seattle is a FABULOUS place to enjoy yourself.

pg7MyTMJaa	yeah north columbus is decent, i live in phenix cityalabama which you culd also find some decent places to live, however if you decide on phenix cty youll wantto live on the lee county sde rather thanin russel county in my opinion. Alot of it depends on whether you want to rent or buy a home or look for an apartment.  I rent a home in phenix city andwork on fort benning about 25 minutes away depending on traffic.

JcZIjpU4aa	Tamarindo is a town next to a beach, its a nice place, not exactly the place you want to go to if you want to get away from civilization since its really developed, there are many hotels, shopping, restaurants, etc. Still the beach is nice, and the locals are nice too. But like i said, if you want to relax and get away from reality, i dont think this is the place. Oh and also there is some nightlife here, bars and such.<br>  <br>  Tambor is a hotel(named after the beach its located at), I last went here a few years ago and honestly from the 3 beaches you mention this is the one i would recommend the least. The beach isn't the best, and really i just dont think its worth visiting.<br>  <br>  And then theres Curu, which is a wildlife reserve. This place is amazing, one of my favorite places to visit. I have told people about it and they absolutely loved it too. But this is a place to relax completely, theres really nothing there other than you and nature. The rooms are very simple, nothing fancy. The beach is very nice and you can also take small tours to other beaches and islands close by from Curu. Also Montezuma and Malpais, which are very famous, are close to Curu maybe 2 hours driving at the most. But overall i would say this is the best of all three, you just need to know that its nothing fancy at all. I say this because i know people who have gone there and they realize they cant stay there because they expected better rooms or its not civilized enough for them...<br>  <br>  Hope that helps :)|`|mvBKrIuUaa	I was in Costa Rica in 2007. Go to www.gisdatasystems.com ... to check out my photos and a map that i have created. I traveled the back roads from Malpais to Tamarindo. Malpais was a nature lovers get away.

I hear that is the place to be for a nightlife. email me if you have any more questions.

But most of the products found in those are found here as well. <br>  Instead we have Carrefour & Geant which are the Europan franchises similar to those.<br>  For the person who said we don't have shopping malls , I'd like to inform them that DUbai is traditionally a trading town so your statement couldn't be more untrue. In the old days before airconditiong they used to call them covered Souqs (Souq =mall or market in arabic). And if you mean American-style closed indoor type malls , the first such mall here opened in 1980~1 I believe which is AL Ghurair Mall still today very frequented by shoppers here , but it has been expanded since .<br>   The city of Dubai has over 50 such malls in various configurations and types of outlets, let alone the whole of the UAE which will more than double this number.<br>  <br>  @h<br>  I think you meant to say Ibn Battuta mall represents 7 cultures (rather than countries), as Ibn Battuta (which is like the Arabic Marco Polo guy) traveled all the countries between Morocco to China (including Africa, India & Indian ocean islands, & Spain as well)
q7z7Ni3Daa	I don't know how up-to-date this is, but from Turkish site <br>  www.cannabist.net<br>  <br>  In Turkey, smoking and trade of joint is forbidden. Any joint smoker is conditionally discharged on condition of being subject to treatment. Any such person, who does not comply with 1 year of conditional discharge and with the rules of the treatment, or any person who sells joint is sentenced with imprisonment. Additionally, since such a case would be written down of such person’s register, his/her social and professional life goes under danger.<br>  <br>  I imagine this means that they treat a first (non-selling) offense lightly, as in no jail time, but there will be a lot of paperwork to go through before it is over. <br>  There always is a lot of paperwork whenever the government is involved in Turkey.<br>  <br>  The movie Midnight Express is (pardon my language) a load of crap and should be ignored. It is much different from the book, and even the man who wrote the book says it incorrectly portrays Turks. Turkish prisons are certainly not any fun, but I doubt your boyfriend will end up there. I imagine they would have taken him in right away instead of trusting him to show up later for prison.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to him!|`|Xkas9BG2aa	There was an American movie made some time ago about Turkey, its laws and drug offenses.  It was called "Midnight Express" and it was about an American who was treated poorly by the court system in Turkey and what a nightmare it became for him.  It didn't portray Turkey in a positive light and uncovered corruptions within the Turkish system.  Not sure what was fact or fiction in the book, but if it was fact then you have reason to fear for your boyfriend.|`|aFI8mH3gaa	not sure of the law or what they can do, but i know they take it very seriously in turkey! ive had a couple of conversations with turkish people that have said they have done cannabis abroad, but would never do it in turkey, as there would be serious consequences!|`|JpATzZZsaa	just smoking is not crime,  selling is crime<br>  <br>  probabality they ll investigate that is he saler if he is not then no problem he wont go prison

PA0bGBtCaa	You should have clarified that up during the interview. Reserve is not the best thing in the world. It's basically sick time relief, vacation relief, and short staff relief. You will commute to your base city and sit there for the duration of your "trip" until your phone rings and they call you to work a flight. You may or may not fly at all. You're guranteed at least 75 hours a month, and of course you get paid for the extra hours if you fly more than that. You will have to share a crash pad with a few other flight attendants becuase you will need to be within a 30 minute commute to the airport once called. Usually flight attendants from a graduating class will usually share a crash pad since they are all familiar with one another and they will always have the same base city because they are the most junior flight attendants and bases are separated by seniority. It could be up to three years, or more. That all depends on the airline you're working for.|`|AA11496012	Just as Tim said, it is like being on call.  If you are scheduled to be on reserve, you may fly if the scheduled flight attendant for that flight does not show up.  But if all the flight attendants do show up for their flights, you don't have to fly.  You will still get paid something for being on reserve.  When you just start out, you have no seniority so whatever flights the more senior flight attendants don't want are given to the flight attendants who have little or no seniority.  With airlines having cut lots of flights, those who just started may be on reserve for awhile.

I have done that on a previous trip when I went a bit overboard.  As to whether the airport in Austin has a post office I do not know although I have never seen one in any of the airports I have been in.  Your best bet may be to locate the nearest post office and send it from there.|`|GEDE2td7aa	Well, mailing the deodorant and nail filing kit home would certainly be cheaper than $15.<br>  <br>  If you really don't need the the things, I would say to just throw them away.

UE1evlTlaa	Cocoa Beach and Daytona are your closest bets for beaches.<br>  <br>  But, a GORGEOUS beach area is located just a little ways away in Tampa. It is MAYBE an hour and a half drive and the drive is definitely worth it. The beaches are clean and really nice. There are also some really nice wildlife areas that would be great for your kids. I highly recommend Fort Desoto in Tampa. I am actually heading there this weekend because I love it so much! Check it out online. It is a National Park.|`|tV7ZYIeEaa	Closest one is Cocoa beach on the east coast<br>  <br>  If you want the nicest go to the west coast beaches Clearwater St Pete<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.floridasbeach.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.floridasbeach.com/</a>|`|aihogb26aa	Both Cocoa Beach and Daytona are fairly close (about1.5 hours away). Both are fairly touristy areas and the beaches are pretty commercial and can get crowded there, but they can still be fun beaches. If you are looking for quieter, prettier beaches you could travel a little further to St. Pete/ Clearwater near Tampa, or go a little further north from Daytona to the Ormond Beach /Flagler County areas.|`|aEeCCHVlaa	Since Orlando is in the middle of the State, there are no "close" beaches.  On the East Coast, there is Cocoa Beach, Playlinda (Titusville), New Smyrna Beach, Daytona Beach - all about 1 hr drive from Orlando.  New Smyrna and Daytona does allow cars on the beach, the others don't.  On the West Coast, beaches are all along St. Petersburg, Clearwater areas.  Those would be 2 to 2-1/2 hr drive from Orlando.|`|Wqjaz2cgaa	It sound's as though you've quite a handful! It's quite a drive from Orlando to the beach, so be prepared!<br>  To the east Cocoa beach is around one and a half hours drive.  But it's very built up behind the beach, which doesn't make for attractive scenery.  Southwards from Cocoa Beach lie more attractive beaches, like Sebastian Inlet, another hours drive.  <br>  West of Orlando you have the fabulous Gulf Coast beaches like Caladesi Island and Fort De Soto, but this is an even longer drive, at  3 hours or more. Far more suitable for young kids though, as the water is generally calmer, warmer, and more toddler friendly.<br>  A better alternative might be to visit one of the beautiful natural springs parks, like Wekiwa springs, a stones throw from Orlando. Though you may have your heart set on the big wide ocean.<br>  Have a great vacation!|`|n6IBfiDPaa	I dont live in Florida, but when I went there and stayed by Orlando, we went to Daytona Beach

PA0bGBtCaa	Well there are many carts out there that are usually seen around airplanes, but based on what you just described, I would say it was an "Air Start." When the airplane's APU (little engine in the tail cone) goes out, then the engines can't get the compressed air it needs to start the engines. Compressed air is needed to initially turn the blades of the engine to fire them up. Once they are running, the engine will suck air from outside via the blades and compress it on its own.<br>  <br>  Well the air start just delivers compressed air to the engines. That loud noise you heard when they turn it on is the unit compressing the air. Since the APU it out, the plane also cannot provide passengers with air conditioning or heat until one of the engines is running. That is why they run one of the engines at the gate because you can't do an air start away from the gate. This happens quite frequently in the airline industry. It has nothing to do with the performance of the plane once both engines are running.

I'll try to hit each of your bullets the best I can.<br>  <br>  *There are a lot of good bars on River Street which is somewhere you should visit anyways.

Club One used to be the place to go in Savannah, but I don't know if its open anymore.  Other than that, I'm not sure where you could go dancing.<br>  <br>  *The best ghost tour I've been on is the savannahtours.net ghost tour.  It's the one that's featured on tv a lot.<br>  <br>  *Here's the thing about Lady and Sons...it's worth the wait.  The food is simple southern comfort food...but it's delicious.  I'm sure you know how it works, but you line up in the morning to get a time to come back.  The last time I went I got there about 30 minutes before the opening bell, and I had lunch shortly after that.  Just get up in the morning, go to the host stand, and go ahead and volunteer yourself for a dinner time later in the day instead of lunch.  If you get there early and try to get a lunch time, you won't get something sooner than later.  When you tell them up front you want a dinner time, you can leave to do whatever and come back.<br>  <br>  On River Street, there is the great little greek place.  I can't remember the name of it, but it's near where the ferry docks.  It's delicious and authentic.

urHPuzMsaa	There is no way you will walk from the Stratosphere to the rest of the strip. Besides it being too far to walk there is a lot of nothing between with the exceptions of the Sahara, Riviera, Circus Circus and a timeshare. You can catch the bus right outside the hotel or take the trolley to the rest of the strip. It is really nice inside the Stratosphere it's just the rest of the strip hasn't caught up as they originally planned.|`|1zy9ckbzaa	The location is the only reason I would recommend changing hotels.  It is such a long walk to the other casinos, hotels, clubs, dining rooms, attractions worth going to.  Walking up and down the strip to and from the hotel is something I would not do.  It is so long.  It may be hot depending on what time of year you go.   I have walked the long walk from stratoshpere to the rest of the strip by myself and felt fine.  That was because of I was walking "with" (behind) other Vegas visitors. And there are always people walking the strip, even on that end of the strip.<br>        The hotel itself is nice. If you do stay there don't get the least expensive rooms pay the extra  10 or 20 for the deluxe. The standard rooms look like dorm rooms.|`|yvPA8FSsaa	The Stratosphere is good but as you have seen from other people the it is at the edge of the Strip near some seedy areas.  But, I always rent a car while I am in Vegas anyway so it makes no difference to me.  The bus is slow and the taxis expensive.  Just a few taxi rides easily equal the cost of a rental.  <br>  <br>  Once you know your way around the car is great.  There are streets that run parallel to the Strip and rear entrances to the hotels that save a lot of time in traffic and a lot of walking.  But if you do not want to rent a car, I suggest changing your hotel for one with a better location.  Again, it will cost more again approaching the cost of renting a car.  <br>  <br>  I love having a car because you can also drive to the outlying hotels like the Rio or drive to Fremont Street in the old Downtown or drive over to a shopping center off the strip for an ATM that does not charge a $15 fee like the ones in the Casinos.  Or even take a day trip out to the Red Rock Canyon or Hoover Dam.<br>  <br>  *|`|2b7305d1c95ef00f36adb96e6bd2ca68aa	If you still have the opportunity to change hotels you should do so. The area around the Strat is pretty grungy and if you want to step outside at night, you are pretty much limited to taking a bus to the other casinos. The Strat itself is an OK hotel, it's just the location.<br>  <br>  Here is a map of the strip: <a href="http://www.lasvegasmaps.com/stripmap.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lasvegasmaps.com/stripmap.htm...</a>  Try to find something in the central part of the strip and you will enjoy the lights and action and will also feel safe. You will also be able to walk to the major attractions such as the fountains at Bellagio and the pirate show at Treasure Island. BTW, the map gives the illusion that distances are shorter than they really are. It is quite a walk from the Strat to, say, Circus Circus. A block on the Strip is equivalent to a half dozen normal city blocks.|`|dFBccLExaa	If I were you, I'd go further south and stay in the main part of the strip, or I'd go more north to the Downtown area (Freemont Exp). The area around the Strat isn't the greatest, and it's not the most happening part of the Strip. I'd go elsewhere. Luxor and NYNY have great deals at the moment. And downtown is always cheaper because not as many people stay down there.|`|AA10240904	I would not recommend you go walk to another casino after dark anywhere away from the Strip hotel area.  Stratosphere is in an older section once called Naked City (showgirls sunbathed in apartments where Stratosphere is).  The closest other hotel is Sahara and then Circus Circus and Riveria.<br>  <br>  BTW The Strip from Sahara to Mandalay is a long four mile walk one way.  If you want to see the other hotels you either rent a car or move hotels|`|XAkLPdhqaa	The Stratosphere at night wasn't so bad after I saw the vampire show 'Bite' .That was a couple of years ago . It is not close to other hotels. In this bad economy I can see that area being very dangerous.<br>  <br>  I've usually stayed downtown for the cheaper rates. In this economy they should be giving rooms away.|`|5hxWSezPaa	The Stratosphere is the worst part of the strip.  I stopped my car to go in to gamble a couple of months ago and, upon seeing the neighborhood and the low class of people coming out the door I changed my mind and left.  If you can possibly do so change hotels.|`|zqEBmLeuaa	Unfortunately, Stratosphere is a very nice hotel, but in a bad location.  That section of the strip is within walking distance to only Circus Circus, Slots of Fun, Sahara, and maybe Riviera.  It is a fun hotel to visit, even at night, but only as far as getting off the bus and going into the hotel and then getting back on the bus when you are done.  It seems fine during the daytime, though.<br>  <br>  This is the reason their rates are so low.  You are still only a bus ride away from the main part of the strip if you choose to stay there.  But luckily, because of the economy, all of the hotels are advertising super low rates.  And for your wedding night, you might want to stay somewhere a little better.  Here is a website that has the absolute best promo codes that the hotels release to email members.  They are usually only supposed to go to a select number of people, but because of this website everyone has access to the great deals.<br>  <a href="http://smartervegas.com/" rel="nofollow">http://smartervegas.com/</a><br>  <br>  I always use this when booking my trips to Vegas.  I am assuming you chose to stay at the Stratosphere because of their lower prices, and because of this I would definitely recommend Excalibur.  It's a great hotel on a budget, and I would suggest upgrading to their newly renovated widescreen rooms, they are beautiful.  Their standard rooms are just like staying at any regular hotel.  They have a special right now for $22/night.  It depends on what dates you are going, but all of their dates (excluding weekends) are between $27 and $65 for the next two months.  Even weekends run between $57 and $120 per night.<br>  <br>  But some nicer hotels to consider are<br>  <br>  Caesar's Palace- from $120/night and 4th NIGHT FREE!<br>  Flamingo- from $45/night and 4th NIGHT FREE!<br>  Luxor- from $42/night<br>  Mandalay Bay from $65/night (normally $110 on special!)<br>  MGM Grand from $49/night<br>  Mirage from $58/night<br>  Paris from $80/night<br>  THEhotel at Mandalay Bay from $100/night<br>  Treasure Island from $49/night<br>  <br>  <br>  And here is link to an interactive map of the strip so you can see the locations of the hotels <a href="http://visitlasvegas.com/vegas/stay/planning-information/interactive-maps.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://visitlasvegas.com/vegas/stay/plan...</a><br>  <br>  If you click on "THE STRIP (NORTH)" you can see how far Stratosphere is actually located from the rest of the main hotels.  I would say anything from Treasure Island to Mandalay Bay is completely safe and has easy access to everything.

Also, there is the Tidal Basin and DC itself used to have many canals that they used to carry cargo.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	The Potomac River forms one border of the District of Columbia. The White House doesn't sit on the banks of the Potomac, but it is within easy walking distance. The White House is also very close to the Tidal Basin, a reservoir of the Potomac (the famous cherry trees surround the Tidal Basin).|`|URO3gDXcaa	the potomac|`|NnMzREtNaa	Yes, it is the Potomac River. If you are on the South Lawn of the White House, or in any south facing rooms, you will see the river off in the distance just past the Washington Monument and the Jefferson Memorial. It is within walking distance of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue (aka the White House). <br>  <br>  Fun fact: President John Q. Adams liked to go swimming nude in the river during the early morning hours when he was president in the 1800s. Once, a reporter took his clothes and refused to return them until he gave her an interview!|`|sU60NqWWaa	The Potomac (?)

I think it takes about an hour to get from Frederick to the beltway (maybe 45 min) and it would take longer to get to McLean. And that's without traffic, which can be bad on both 270 and the beltway. I doubt you could get from one to the other in under an hour and it could easily be two or more in bad traffic. Or in other words, I would look for something closer in.

b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	Cat, how can you make a statement like "poor routing" when you don't know anything about it?  Neither do I, but that's why I don't make comments based on nothing.   <br>  Most likely it has to do with where a major sorting facility is.  If the thing gets to you, who cares where it was before you got it?  <br>  I don't work for the Postal Service.  I don't know anyone who does.  But think about it:  this is a huge country.  You can mail something in California and, within a couple of days, it is delivered to a specific address in New York, 3,000 miles away.  And our postal rates are lower than almost anywhere else in the world.  That's pretty damn good, don't you think?|`|URO3gDXcaa	ask the post office|`|p1yIVINraa	Poor routing on the USPS's part.

lzEuuseJaa	In the LA area the apt cost is going to be a little less than NY, and the apts a little larger, with cost depending on the variables (safety, environment, etc), just like in NY. <br>  <br>  Young and single and like the night life, West Hollywood, West LA, etc. Expensive, but if you have a roommate and don't spend a lot, it can work. Into nature, hiking, art, willing to drive for nightlife, then Glendale, Burbank, Pasadena are good options, less expensive than the westside of LA, more sedate lifestyle.<br>  <br>  Your lifestyle as a vet tech in LA would be similar to what it would be in NY. Supposedly it's a good, growing field to get into, but the pay isn't that great, especially considering there isn't a way to move up and get paid significantly more without a lot more education.

However, such a place just doesn’t exist; the two terms are mutually exclusive. It's all about supply and demand: If it's in SoCal, then it's not going to be cheap to begin with. If it's a safe area, then it's more expensive. If you need good schools, add a couple hundred bucks a month on top of it.<br>  <br>  If you want to live here and enjoy the weather, then you have to pay for it. You put up with the smog and the traffic, enjoy the weather and pay your rent or mortgage. My advice is to start checking out craigslist, rent.com, and apartments.com if you are looking to rent. You’ll quickly see that the minimum rent for a non-war zone is about $1,000-$1,200 per month for a studio or 1BR. Really nice areas (like the West LA area) easily run $3,000 or more. Want to live near the beach? Expect to pay a premium. <br>  <br>  "LA" is such a big place, there are so many neighborhoods/cities where you can live.

AA12343309	I am 73 closer to 74 and was raised in Southeast Texas.  Back when I was growing up people always spoke to each other walking on the streets downtown black and white.  We always exchanged civilities.  It is just an old southern custom.  <br>  <br>  I read once in a novel based in the South where "white people weren't suppose to talk to black people."  Nothing could be further than the truth. We always exchanged civilities with black people whether we knew them or not and actually if people were waiting for a bus, black and white people visited with each other while waiting.  Now Jim Crow laws separated us once we got on the bus.   Black people still frequently will say, "How are you?" in passing.<br>  <br>  I have a woman living in my house right now waiting to have a new home built.  She was raised by Alabama born and bred mother.  She speaks to everyone and wishes them God's blessing, black or white, whether she knows them or not.

1d718ff96585004e8d1e8bc312c3655daa	I'd like to know where this guy found a HOUSE in Manhattan.  And, if he's not paying rent and he can't live off of $40,000 a year, he's doing drugs.  Like seriously.  The majority of one's salary in Manhattan goes towards rent - if you're not paying that, then you're living by the same means, give or take a dollar or two more on some goods, than the rest of the country.  You do the math.|`|2bca07912249cffd6d15a663fd5ae28caa	your friend is crazy.<br>  <br>  if you can get 3300 after tax and not have to pay for much or any of your essentials, and if you're pretty cheap besides, then you're doing a lot better than most average New Yorkers.<br>  <br>  that 3300 is basically "free money", and i'd find it pretty offensive for him to say that it wasn't much. most working class people could only dream to keep 40k a year!<br>  <br>  EDIT: €ura, i don't think he "found" a house in Manhattan, his family probably bought it decades ago when they were giving them away, and he's just born lucky. i know a lot of people like that around town, and it's not all that unusual. just depends on who you know...|`|6qGHT77Raa	in manhattan money goes through ones hands..like silk.|`|p1yIVINraa	It's plausible as New York City is extremely expensive, as they have to bring in almost everything as far as food and such to live on.

I am south african and have lived in Berlin, Germany for the past 3 years and prices have gone way up in South Africa - especially in the toruisty areas like the Waterfront, Cape Town.

The problem only comes in when you work here as well (not a salary in Pounds but in Rands). The percentage of our salaries that goes into food, cars and homes is much more than most other countries. <br>  <br>  Thus, you can come here and enjoy our country at a really great price.<br>  <br>  Now, just think how hard it is for us as South Africans to get out of the country...

0ed3a47409dac89fe63086d50549f520aa	Just as a warning, train travel within Norway is limited (mostly due to natural barriers). There are no trains as far north as Lofoten, so you'll have to fly, drive or take a bus. You'll also have to take other transport to see most of the fjords, because they often aren't closely connected to railways. You can get from Oslo to Bergen or Stavanger without problem, but from there you'll need alternate transport. To go north from Bergen, you have to take an 8 hour train ride back to Oslo, then continue north. You can see a route map here:<br>  <a href="http://www.nsb.no/getfile.php/www.nsb.no/nsb.no/Bilder/Rutetabeller/Nytt_rutekart.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.nsb.no/getfile.php/www.nsb.no...</a><br>  <br>  If you need cheap flights, try here:<br>  <a href="http://momondo.com" rel="nofollow">http://momondo.com</a><br>  <br>  The German train site is one of the better for booking long journeys:<br>  <a href="http://www.bahn.de/international/view/en/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.bahn.de/international/view/en...</a><br>  <br>  You normally can't book the entire journey online though, so you'll need to call a local number for them (found on the site) or book each leg individually. The shortest route I found is Rome - Munich - Hamburg - Copenhagen - Gothenburg - Oslo, which takes about 40 hours.<br>  <br>  You could try a Eurail pass, the Global pass allows travel in any of the countries that accept it during a certain time period. Since Germany doesn't border Italy, I don't think you could use a Select pass (5 countries).

Oh, and Bologna is totally cool if you get to stop there on your way north, totally worth an overnight as it's a quaint true Italian experience.<br>  <br>  Have fun!

Em0Nf6Fpaa	First off, psychiatry is an extremely flawed 'science'. <br>  <br>  Second, tabloid 'journalism' has its own peculiar agenda of distorting and fomenting mass hysteria. ie. It sells! I'm puzzled this came from The Independent, usually a well regarded broadsheet presenting alternative but solid viewpoints. <br>  <br>  Even physicians working in the same facility have been shown to come up with different diagnoses of the same patients, including normality. It's totally subjective.<br>  <br>  The Professor is a Brit working in the US. Naturally, his report is politically or socially biased towards the Brits and Americans. This amounts to no more than national or cultural stereotyping under the slightly sinister (or just plain silly) guise of a self inflated 'scientific report'. It's a smug, pat onself on the back gloat by an academic desperately concocting over-the-top theories to garner attention and discussion so he doesn't lose his funding.<br>  <br>  Note that Americans are on top of 'extroverts' – the report says that extreme extroversion results in psychotic behaviour. I'm not surprised that America as a nation has not classed itself as a 'neurotic extrovert' based on the way it's messed up the world with its strong arm tactics foreign policy. The average American is a paranoid schizophrenic who thinks the rest of the world is either gagging for a Green Card or wants to blow them up. This comes from my impression of interacting face-to-face with grown up Americans. I'm not even talking about the anti-social and ignorant pubescents that Y!A is overrun by.<br>  <br>  <br>  The second report is unrelated to the first. Why cobble the two together except to further sensationalise this kind of mob quackery and slapdash labelling for mere convenience? How is that actually *helpful* to anyone?<br>  <br>  Neurosis is a different condition caused by a whole different set of factors including national history, culture, society, not to mention, wars against other nations - from stress caused *specifically* by living in a competitive environment.<br>  <br>  Please separate the facts from the hubris.<br>  <br>  ..............................<br>  <br>  EDIT1: moobox, I have nothing to say to you. You've already proven yourself with your se.xual solicitation of an underaged female answerer here who asked about goat's milk. :) I haven't forgotten.<br>  <br>  EDIT2: Dear Canadian Friedrice Sir/Madam,<br>  <br>  Ah. The “anti-West” 'argument'. Thinking that the whole world hates you IS a symptom of paranoid schizophrenia. There, there. We don't hate you. Promise. <br>  <br>  Now, time for your afternoon meds. (joke, that is, if you can take one yourself) <br>  <br>  The first report was going for an exceedingly narrow angle and it of course 'proved' it. Frame the questions one way and what else would you find but exactly the foregone conclusions you want. <br>  <br>  I would be VERY interested to see a report of how the French or Germans view the Brits or Americans. Could they be wrong just because there are more of you, fewer of them? And even fewer of us in Singapore?<br>  <br>  Please take an honest look at your own problems before deeming oneself superior to be handing out well-intentioned but patronising 'diagnoses' of others. How is the way you run your own society any more 'right' than the way we run ours? Another symptom of the same condition.<br>  <br>  How can America not be mentally disordered itself when each year more of their people are killed by their own, including CHILDREN, running amok with guns, in drug-related crimes and suicides, than in its wars against other countries? And the consumption of prescription drugs for mental illnesses is the highest in the world? Including depression which has become so normalised and accepted as part of modern American life? This is the standard of 'normal' and a shining model of behaviour for the rest of the world to look up to?<br>  <br>  Yes, you've mentioned you are Canadian, but it is you who chose to lump yourself with "the West". Which gives off an 'off' whiff because all Canadians I have met so far take great pains to differentiate themselves from Americans. Is it because you have trouble telling 'us' apart you assume 'WE' can't tell you apart?<br>  <br>  You have of course failed to grasp that this isn't even anything "anti-Western" but anti-any kind of stereotyping.<br>  <br>  <br>  The article even begins by gleefully admitting to traditional Brit anti-French and anti-German sentiments and this report does nothing but perpetuate GROTESQUE national stereotypes. It makes that famous scene in the Brit sitcom Fawlty Towers with English B&B owner Basil Fawlty doing the Nazi salute and the goose step in front of their horrified German guests into something that is not even a joke or parody any more. <br>  <br>  No, I'm NOT anti-Western at all. You appear to be new here so my comments are out of context for you. Y!A Singapore regulars will have seen my responses to other questions on Singapore that I'm not so enamoured of my own country that I can't see its faults or take constructive criticism.<br>  <br>  <br>  I was NOT arguing against the second stress report. It is unrelated to the first. Period. <br>  <br>  If you've got a gripe about how you dislike life in Singapore, please put it in a separate post.<br>  <br>  Yes, it IS stressful living in Singapore. It IS overcrowded and competitive. Yes, by the gods, the children are suffering. Understand the difference between “neurosis” and “stress”. I am a parent myself and as a part-product of the local educational system I know enough to have enrolled my own daughter in a Brit curriculum international school instead. <br>  <br>  Are you suggesting we copy YOUR way of life? To what end? <br>  <br>  Coming from someone who worked in the trenches in the area, first in the UK and for a short period in Singapore, I will never agree with parents shunting children off to psychiatrists once a week for an hour and/or pumping them with drugs (a 'Western' solution btw) as the answer. I specialised in a very labour intensive form of behavioural therapy (WITHOUT drugs) that is still seen as somewhat radical and non-mainstream and was, in fact, first developed in the US. I have only the deepest respect for the US consultants I was privileged to work with. I also worked with consultants in Israel in cognitive therapy the theories of which have their roots in central Europe. <br>  <br>  Whatever it takes to get the children better, we should glean the best from everywhere, East, West, North, South, the source does not matter. I just don't believe in wholesale acceptance without questioning of everything that comes out from the West. That is all. <br>  <br>  <br>  That does NOT equal hatred of everything Western. That's simply preposterous.|`|ZRtYinFBaa	canang sari -<br>  <br>  u make some valid points regarding psychiatry as a flawed and subjective science and i'll even give you that 'tabloid journalism' being with its own hidden agenda of distorting the mass media could be a marginally good point.  But I find the rest of your post to be little more than an anti-west, anti-american diatribe that does nothing but to further exemplify why Singaporeans may indeed be 'neurotic'.<br>  <br>  Your sweeping generalizations such as "The Professor is a Brit working in the US. Naturally, his report is politically or socially biased towards the Brits and Americans" and "The average American is a paranoid schizophrenic who thinks the rest of the world is either gagging for a Green Card or wants to blow them up." are both outrageous and lacking in deductive reasoning.  Saying that the nationality of the Professor "naturally" implies his bias shows nothing but your refusal and flat out denial to entertain any diverging opinions from your own, even when (in this case) it comes from an established and respected source.<br>  <br>  As for why Singaporeans are so neurotic, I would say that it's a characteristic that permeates the country and trickles down from the very top levels of government. It's a more or less repressed country.  From the PAP's extremely firm grip on power to its rigid laws and internal policies to its strained relations with its neighbors, I think it's a surprise that Singaporeans aren't even higher up on this neuroticism countdown, if it is indeed based on any scientifically sound research.  After all, how could you not be neurotic in a free country where possession of a couple grams of cannabis leads to the death penalty and drinking water on the subway carries up to a $500 fine??|`|CdgF3NjFaa	Why are you guys taking this 1999's article so seriously? That's why you went mad.<br>  <br>  If I have to be serious and mad, i would agree to the notion that the psychobable is simply mad. Asking two or three questions to several people and make sweeping conclusions! Isn't that not mad?<br>  <br>  And some questions are very language sensitive. To give you an example:<br>  <br>  <br>  English: Do you think you are neurotic?<br>  Malay: Adakah anda fikir anda gila?<br>  <br>  See?

SC6YCYOvaa	Hey!<br>  <br>  With a hotel, the best way to go is by booking with Priceline's "name your own price" option. I have done this MANY times and have often gotten four star hotels in midtown Manhattan which is right near the UN building, for $80 per night. The rooms usually go for $200+ per night. Just choose the midtown and Upper East Side locations, and you'll be near the UN. Really anywhere in Manhattan and you can easily get to the UN via a cab or the subway. NYC has an amazing mass transit system, which is very safe.<br>  <br>  There is a site which talks about how exactly to book $80 hotel rooms in NYC through Priceline. You may want to check it out.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.CheapInTheCity.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.CheapInTheCity.com</a><br>  <br>  With the ride into the city, you can take a cab, but it has a flat rate of $55 each way, plus tolls and a tip.

It is a round trip right?|`|dpKntiZoaa	Well I saw some of your answers and so know that you have been to/see a lot of Western Europe anyway, plus with the Euro, this is a pricey option.<br>  <br>  If you want cheap and something different, then look towards, Bosnia, Croatia (not the tourist resorts though), Serbia, Montenegro.  A lot of people dismiss these countries in light of recent history, but they are beautiful & have so much to offer.  The weather is nice, the food excellent - plus it is very cheap compared with most of the rest of Europe.<br>  <br>  Plus you can boast of seeing a different side of Europe than most people do.  Most Americans/Brits have been to Western European and even to Eastern Europe such as the Czech republic, Slovakia, Hungry etc - but how many people do you know have been to the Balkans since the it split from the ex-Yugoslavia.<br>  <br>  If you speak to older generations - many visited the area pre-war and have very fond memories of their holidays there, and this is something you can have for a fraction of the price.<br>  <br>  Bosnia and Croatia are gorgeous as I know from personal expereince.  This summer we will venture down to Montenagro for the beaches which are beautiful and non commercial.  Also I have not been to Serbia but look forward to doing so.<br>  <br>  Read up a bit on recent travellers reports and see the photo's and see what you think  <br>  <br>  Here is one collection I know which represents Bosnia really well <a href="http://www.pbase.com/alangrant/root" rel="nofollow">http://www.pbase.com/alangrant/root</a>|`|rvTcDJ6yaa	Croatia is lovely and cheaper than other areas in europe. While Dubrovnik is pretty it is more pricy than other places but don't let that put you off. I paid 20euros (ok this was in 2005 now) for a nights accommodation in Dubrovnik...NOT in the old part of town as thats more expensive. THey have a B&B style of accommodation but not called that where you stay in a home ( but you don't mix with them per se.....). The man whose house it was hooked me up with some cheap accommodation in Split as well which was good too. Other places might be cheaper but I paid more in Zadar and Zargreb to stay in hotels. Buses are the main transportation (no trains down the coast) and you can get an overnight one from zargreb to dubrovnik thats 12hrs and sleep on the bus like i did ( saves on accommodation costs).<br>  An option at least.|`|3LjguP3maa	I would recommend Albania as a country that you should go.  It has the cheapest prices, much cheaper than western european countries and the other ballkan countries.  It has beatiful ruins and landscapes.

It is a very fun place to go and it wont hurt your wallet.|`|lalM2uABaa	i suggest Prague for a city break. Lots of history in the most beautiful city in europe.

i7oHTo9haa	The center for the Arab and Islamic world is Mecca.  Jerusalem is meaningless to them they turn their backs on Jerusalem five times a day when they pray towards Mecca.<br>  <br>  The only reason Jerusalem and the rest of Israel matters to them is because it is the Jewish capitol.  They couldn't stand the fact that Jewish people lived in other Muslim dominated lands and being a Jewish dhimmi in Muslim dominated lands wasn't good enough. During WW2 they drafted Muslim SS troops and erected concentration camps in Muslim dominated lands. <br>  <br>  Jewish people have recovered and have full control of their own country now and it just eats them up.  It eats them up so much that they developed this Palestinian crisis to try to take all of Israel and Jerusalem one piece at a time.  <br>  <br>  "The Palestinian people does not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel for our Arab unity. In reality today there is no difference between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. Only for political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a Palestinian people, since Arab national interests demand that we posit the existence of a distinct "Palestinian people" to oppose Zionism. For tactical reasons, Jordan, which is a sovereign state with defined borders, cannot raise claims to Haifa and Jaffa. While as a Palestinian, I can undoubtedly demand Haifa, Jaffa, Beer-Sheva and Jerusalem. However, the moment we reclaim our right to all of Palestine, we will not wait even a minute to unite Palestine and Jordan." -- PLO Executive Committee member Zuhayr Muhsin, March 31, 1977, interview with the Dutch newspaper Trouw."<br>  <br>  It has never been a secret that Jerusalem is the long standing capitol of the Jewish nation.  When Jewish people had majority in diaspora, we always prayed to the EAST.  While in the East, we pray towards Jerusalem. And when in Jerusalem, we prayed towards HaKotel. Three times a day. All of the Bimah in our Synagogues are situated so that the congregation prays towards the East and that is where we direct our prayer. The  HaKotel is the Western Wall of the remaining part of the Temple that was built with dedication and love and is coming again whether people are ready or not.<br>  <br>  Having a different religion trying to take control of the Jewish capitol is nothing new.  People have been fighting over it for millenium. During Roman rule, they renamed Judea after the old Jewish arch enemy, the Philistines.  David beat Goliath and the rest of the Philistines but that didn't stop the Romans from renaming it Palestine and trying to erase history.  During Byzantine (Christian) rule the hatred for Jewish people was so deep that the Byzantines allowed Muslims to build their Mosque and Dome on Israel's Holiest Temple Mount site. During the Byzantine rule there were also forced conversions and they they closed the Golden Gate so as to try to prevent the Jewish Moshiach from coming to Jerusalem.  Many Christians have recovered so much from their earlier ill sentiments. Nostra Aetate was developed by the Catholic Church back in the 60's as attempt at reparation of previous harm done to Jewish people. At one point when Pope Benedict was a Bishop tried to instruct Catholics to pray to the East in unity with Judaism. And Pope John Paul did his momentous visit to Jerusalem and prayed personally at the Western Wall asking G-d for forgiveness for what his people have done to Jewish people.<br>  <br>  So you see nobody disputes that Jerusalem is the Jewish capitol and it's really nothing new that another group would try to gain control.<br>  <br>  The thing that has changed though is that this time Israel is much stronger than in previous times and the Palestinians really are in no position to demand anything and especially something so motivated by politics and out of hate. In Jerusalem and in Israel, it is all Holy Land, it requires  a certain amount of love and respect.<br>  <br>  Why the Wall is Holy<br>  <a href="http://www.aish.com/wallcam/Why_the_Wall_is_Holy.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.aish.com/wallcam/Why_the_Wall...</a><br>  1) Site of the Holy Temple<br>  2) Eternal Symbol<br>  3) Place of Pilgrimage and Tears<br>  4) Focus of Prayers<br>  5) Built with Love and Dedication<br>  6) Site of Jewish Heroism|`|i00SbscLaa	Both Mecca and Jerusalem are politically Arab cities.

The Kaaba itself is Islam's holiest site. The surrounding square has been enlarged to over 16,000 square meters and can accommodate over 300,000 Muslim pilgrims.

Arabs as Arabs, could care less about the sacredness of Mecca, but Muslims as Muslims, as in 1/5 of the entire world's population, care a lot about it.  Arabs make up about 10% of these 1.3 billion people.  How can you say God chose the Jews?  There is only ONE God, as you pointed out, then God must have only one religion.  Judaism is a religion, regardless of what you associate it with, if God chose the Jews, a religous group, that would mean there where other religous groups to choose from, which means he created those for him- not just one religion.  If he chose the Jews- for what? What purpose do they carry out, owning land?  God created the Middle Nation (can you see how that plays) and favoured the Children of Israel, not the Jews, to spread his religion- he favoured the Children of Israel for a purpose, to spread the religion of God- extending outward from the Middle Nation.  God set down one religion and from there man distorted and branched off from it, though it is still hear, that religion is submission to God- "Submission,"  the literall word for "submission" in Arabic is "Islam"-  A "Muslim" an Arabic word- meaning one who submits or has submitted- therefore every praise or accusation you make of "Muslims" is directly praising or accusing those who submit to God- period.  The Messiah, Jesus (PBUH) didn't exist until well after Abraham, therefore Abraham was not a christian- The term Judaism comes from the name Judah- Judah was among the 12 sons of Israel.  Israel was the nickname given to the prophet Jacob (PBUH) who existed well after Abraham- therefore Abraham was not a Jew.  Muslims believe in all prophets and messengers and all scriptures of revelation.  All Abraham did was submit to the one true God- the God that Muslims, Christians, and Jews worship- Abrham "Submitted," he was literally a "Muslim"- there can be no dispute about that.  You trully think you have submitted to God?  Then your a Muslim, you just don't know it yet.  The Jews don't believe in Jesus (PBUH) or Muhammad (PBUH), the Christians don't believe in Muhammad (PBUH) and asociate a partner with God, a son, turning a monotheistic religion into a confusing 3 in 1 ratio.  Muhammad was the last of the Prophets (PBUT) and the Qur'an, which in Arabic literally means "that which is recited" was the last of the scriptures.  Jews Believe in the Torah, Christians in the Gospel- why not everything?- the scrolls fo Abraham, the Psalms, The Torah, The Gospel, and The Qur'an.  Which religion sounds to be the distorted one?  The one that believes in every prophet and every original scripture or the ones that only believe in a certain number of those?|`|ymXlF9Rnaa	On a flat map the centre of the world would be in the middle of North Africa, on a round globe, it can be anywhere you want it to be.|`|luWMdsrOaa	Israel is the center of the Jewish religion, to none religious muslims Mecca is not.<br>  Jerusalem is an important center.|`|LMv6P1kNaa	Wrong as usual  dear smart az<br>  <br>  One more mistake and you maybe kicked out of the section<br>  <br>  the center of the Arab World is Jerusalem<br>  Understood?|`|5720a35acb05fbf04a17f74f66750115aa	the center of the Arab World is Jerusalem<br>  <br>  Mecca is the center of Islamic World

However the wall is last standing ramnant of the Holy Temple. That wall was part of the outer wall surrounding external cortyard of the Tample. The place where the Temple used to stand is  a place that was chosen by G-d himself and He promissed that His presence will be there. (This of course does not mean that He is not omni-present but He chose that place to express His presence in a very special way). He also commanded us that every Jewish male should present himself to G-d in His appointed place - in Jerusalem at the Temple 3 times a year at His appointed times - Pesach (Passover), Shavuot (known to Christians asPentacost) and Succot. So The Wall for us is the holiest place (well, actually the temple mount is where actual temple stood). We looked upon that place for 2000 years ever since the Second Temple was destroyed as a symbol of our faith and nationhood. So it is very special and intimately holy place for us, and that what is what makes it spesial to pray there. But we certainly pray to G-d and not to the wall.|`|8FbeckyLaa	Correction, the don't "pray" they bang their heads hard till forehead start bleeding. <br>  <br>  Edit @ kismet, ur the one who told me this.<br>  <br>  From: kismet<br>  <br>  Subject: Our Prayer<br>  <br>  Message:  Hi Haifa,<br>  i just want to inform you that when we hit our head as hard as we can and our forehead starts to bleed, every single blood drop make us closer to heaven.|`|YSXDTs3Eaa	The Western Wall is a remaining part of the wall which once surrounded the Holy Temple where the "Sh'khinah" which is G-d's (Omni) Presence was thought to reside.|`|luWMdsrOaa	One religion prays to black stone (fell from the sky), another religion prays to a metal cross, Jews pray to God, they do so at the nearest place to were his Biblical temple stood.|`|5720a35acb05fbf04a17f74f66750115aa	Looking for a spiritual way for continuation of the occupation of Jerusalem on the grounds of religious|`|s26apn70aa	Coz they are Wall-worshipper.

The same goes for any service you use, negotiate the price first and make an agreement before deciding to use it.

Anyone that speaks a little French will go much further and get treated better. Moroccans kinda struggle with French too, so they're understanding of mistakes. Speaking poor Arabic is not so useful, except for numbers for buying stuff. Buying Moroccan clothes is cool and people will think you're polite & cute to wear it. Most business owners just want to make money off tourists and will welcome you in any restaurant or tea house and treat you nicely even if it's all men there.<br>  <br>  Also if you have time, go to Oarzazate in the Sahara!

They don't work particularly hard as the luggage is transported on trolleys and they will usually abandon you some way from the check-in any way.<br>  You don't dress like your in Miami or Costa del Sol, on the beach you always wear full bikini, absolutely no topless dressing allowed.<br>  If you like a bit of flirtation with the randy guys then do so but if you want to get intimate just bear in mind that it is illegal for hotels to allow non-resident Moroccan males or females to enter a guests room, not even for a chat.<br>  Many single women, or groups of two or more, travel to Morocco where it is perfectly safe.<br>  As for the guy who said it was unsafe and he had to be on his toes, well I suppose you may have looked a gullible tourists ready to chat to anyone and allow all to rip you off - your decision as to whether or not you want to chat to traders but remember - once you stop and chat about buying something you are virtually committed.<br>  When planning on buying some useless junk (which applies to almost everything you see), start haggling at about one third or less that asked by the trader.<br>  Morocco is a big place and as for where to visit, this depends on what you want to see. Avoid Casablanca, do visit Marrakech, Essaouira, Taroudant, Tafraout, Fes....|`|Bz8WafMxaa	A girlfriend and I just returned from Morocco two weeks ago and had a great time!  We're both Americans in our mid-twenties that live in Germany and travel frequently.<br>  <br>  I was actually pleasantly surprised by the Moroccans and their reaction to us (I found the Egyptians to be much more pushy).  Most everyone was friendly and helpful.<br>  <br>  We did, of course, receive comments (some were lewd), but if we just continued walking and didn't acknowledge the commenter (except for a few laughs to each other--one guy used the pick-up line "You have a big a**"; did he really think we were going to stop and strike up a conversation after that?), we were fine.  <br>  <br>  Some more tips:<br>  --Always wear something that covers your shoulders and knees (for your "protection" and as a sign of respect).<br>  --If you're blonde, you may want to consider a hat or bandana, so you won't stand out as much.<br>  --Talk to your hotel/riad workers about where to go; they certainly won't steer you into a bad place.<br>  --Don't let anyone separate the two of you (some shopkeepers try to).<br>  --Only go in clearly marked taxis.  Each city has petit taxis for within the city (I think they're certain colors in each city) and grand taxis to travel between cities (they're white).  There are taxi stands in each town or have your hotel help you get one if needed.<br>  <br>  Basically, be smart.  If it doesn't feel right, don't do it.  Don't acknowledge any of the comments, but don't be rude either.  We would say hello and smile but just keep walking.<br>  <br>  For more tips on visiting Morocco, see <a href="http://journeysandadventures.today.com/travel-series/morocco/" rel="nofollow">http://journeysandadventures.today.com/t...</a>

Jm3vMKx3aa	No, the visa law is quite simple. It does not depend on the aircraft company you are flying with but it depends on the citizenship you are holding.<br>  <br>  Bona fide transit tourists do not need a visa for changing aircrafts at British airports. To transfer from terminal 1 to terminal 3 they will board a dedicated bus for internal transport and do not need to go through immigration procedures by U.K. Border Agency Officers.<br>  <br>  Direct Airport Transit Visa (DATV) are required for citizens of the following countries: Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Angola, Bangladesh, Belarus, Burma, Burundi, Cameroon, People's Republic of China, Colombia, Congo-Brazzaville, Democratic Republic of Congo (including travel documents issued by the former Zaire), Ecuador, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, India, Iran, Iraq, Ivory Coast, Jamaica, Kenya, Kosovo, Lebanon, Liberia, FYR of Macedonia, Malawi, Moldova, Mongolia, Montenegro, Nepal, Nigeria, Northern Cyprus, Pakistan, Palestinian Authorities, Rwanda, Senegal, Serbia, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Tanzania, Turkey, Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, Uganda, Vietnam, Zimbabwe.<br>  The requirement to obtain a DATV is waived if the traveller holds a visa for Australia, Canada, New Zealand or the United States of America (USA), a valid residence permit for Canada or the USA, a long-term visa (Type D) or residence permit for European Economic Area countries.<br>  <br>  Each country has the right to know which aliens are travelling to or transiting through their territory. The less visa violations occur the more is the chance that countries are taken off the visa list.<br>  <br>  Best example:<br>  Effective 3rd March 2009 citizens of Taiwan do not need a visa to travel to the U.K. as tourists for up to 180 days; citizens of Jamaica however require a visa even if they change aircrafts on a British airport.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://www.ukvisas.gov.uk/en/doineedvisa/visadatvnationals" rel="nofollow">http://www.ukvisas.gov.uk/en/doineedvisa...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.heathrowairport.com/portal/controller/dispatcher.jsp?CiID=4789831dfa423110VgnVCM10000036821c0a____&ChID=217fbf54776d4110VgnVCM10000036821c0a____&Ct=B2C_CT_GENERAL&CtID=448c6a4c7f1b0010VgnVCM200000357e120a____&Ch=Flight+Connections&ChPath=Heathrow%5EGbl%5EHeathrow%5EGeneral%5EAirport+information%5EFlight+Connections&ChIDPath=9a485109350d3110VgnVCM10000036821c0a____^d7b3b727436d4110VgnVCM10000036821c0a____^e734b727436d4110VgnVCM10000036821c0a____^7544b727436d4110VgnVCM10000036821c0a____^8454b727436d4110VgnVCM10000036821c0a____^217fbf54776d4110VgnVCM10000036821c0a____" rel="nofollow">http://www.heathrowairport.com/portal/co...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ukvisas.gov.uk/resources/en/news/jamaicansrequiretransitvisas" rel="nofollow">http://www.ukvisas.gov.uk/resources/en/n...</a>|`|62hGVNhoaa	Many nationalities can transit through Heathrow without a visa provided they have a confirmed onwards connecting flight.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	Britain is grabbing all the money they can get and adding surcharges and green taxes and all that.

LRhG2lW6aa	Hey,<br>  <br>  The main reason why girls/womans are not treated well, is the kind of pervert mentality people have. This mentality is a result of reservations and inability to give woman an equal right. Its a chicken egg problem. Say in mumbai locals they cant let womans travel in the same coaches as man and if they allow those perverts will harrass them. And giving them special treatment will lead to inequal rights. <br>  <br>  So the solution to this problem is to open up highly conservative indian society and let people do what they want to. Say in US, girls are allowed to do watever they want. They are allowed to wear whatever they want. They work everywhere as a bus driver, taxi driver, postman, grocery store etc. Its a human psychology to break all restrictions imposed upon them. So more restrictions are put on the people, on the back of the mind people have craving to break it. <br>  <br>  So openness and educating people is the only option.|`|b7f6b1292b666a974a7a9c247d278b21aa	It is not by moral groups but by thugs taking advantage of it and the efficacy of the Police and the Government are the causes for this.|`|vy2yEwbJaa	because they want to make themselves familiar or a celebrity or have no other useful work of their own to do, or get into politics?!!!?

The average Sri Lankan is probably better-off than the average Indian, but India also has the world's highest number of millionaires (or so I hear).<br>  <br>  Personally, I think I would prefer to live in Sri Lanka rather than India simply because I'm Buddhist and Sri Lanka is a predominantly Buddhist country whereas the predominant religions in India are Hinduism and Islam.

If memory serves they Greyhound station is close to the New York Ave metro station and the Union station metro station, both of which are on the red line. From there you can get a metro train to Du Pont circle (also on the red line) and I think there's a bus that goes from there to the school. If not it's a mile to a mile and a half walk. Contact the school and they can tell you about a bus and how best to get from one to the other.|`|pS4e5OtZaa	From the Greyhound station walk 0.5 miles south to Union Station (a big train station). Take the Red Line Metro (subway) in the direction of "Shady Grove." The 3rd stop will be "Metro Center" a convergence of 3 subway lines. From there either get on the Orange Line in the direction of "Vienna / Fairfax" or the Blue Line in the direction of "Franconia-Springfield" (for your trip, both trains will be using the same track so it doesn't matter which one). The 4th stop is "Rosslyn". Then take a cab or walk 1 miles due north (over the river). This is about 1 mile shorter than walking from Dupont Circle.

McI4AAlmaa	Hi Suzanne!<br>  I guess downtown is not a good idea, because its a working center of Rio, the best places to stay is in beach area like ipanema, copacabana and leblon.<br>  Rio de Janeiro is divided into the South (Zona Sul), the North (Zona Norta) and the Centre (Centro) zone. Beautiful beach areas of Ipanema, Leme, Copacabana, Leblon, Sao Conrado and Loigoa are located in the South; the North is not interesting and is unsafe at night (find out more about each of these regions in our Rio de Janeiro destination guide). The Centre is home to most of the city's highlights with the monuments of the fallen soldiers of World War II in the South and the Morro de Sao Bento in the North.<br>  So, Rio has lots of options for any budgets when i was there i use this agency to book hotels for me ( <a href="http://www.riodejaneiro-hotels.travel/" rel="nofollow">http://www.riodejaneiro-hotels.travel/</a> ), is a good option to get an agency becuase you can have  guarantees and the prices used to be cheaper than book directly and you can count with a bigger structure to provides you support when necessary.<br>  <br>  Hope i have helped|`|fM7CwTwzaa	Well, I don't usually go for true "budget" accomodations since I like a good quality hotel. I don't like high prices though, and when I was in Rio, I stayed in a place called the Luxor Continental Copacabana. The rates were much lower than the places up towards Ipanama and the hotel was only about a 200-yard walk to the Copacabana strip. <br>  <br>  Worked for me anyway....|`|7eLFBoSOaa	Listen to what Eccentric said, she is  right.

I would suggest you stay at Leblon or Ipanema. Copacabana is less safe.. In Leblon you have a hostel something like, Lemon hostel.. and in Ipanema you also have a hostel. They are usually well maintained. A nice tip.. take a taxi in Rio. The locals do it it really is not safe. Also beware of hotels in the backstreets in Copacabana. These are the ones that pop up cheaper on hotel search sites.. they are nice but be careful, thieves follow you back to your hotel. The name was something like Marlin or the like. Good luck and keep safe, don't take any jewelry or expensive glasses.

What I recommend is to fly to Las Vegas, rent a car stop off at your favorite buffet and pig out.  There are very few opportunities along the route. If you eat a hearty breakfast you do not need to eat again until dinner.<br>  <br>  I stop off at a convenience store and get a cheap disposable cooler, bag of ice and a few bottles of whatever and maybe some snack food if you are into nibbling.  My wife is.<br>  <br>  Then head off to the Grand Canyon at a relaxed pace.  I stay at a hotel just outside of the Park entrance.  If you leave in the morning you should get there before dark.  Check in, have dinner and before the sun sets, grab your camera and head off into the Park.  There are some beautiful vistas to photograph as the sun sets.  <br>  <br>  Once it gets dark, drive back to the hotel for a shower and go to bed early.  Get up before dawn, have breakfast and drive into the Park again.  You will catch the sunrise which can also be pretty spectacular.  You now have all day to explore the Grand Canyon at your leisure.  There is a road with convenient places to park all along the way to get out and take in the view.  There are also gift shops sprinkled along the way and a Look Out tower, too.  <br>  <br>  The part of the Canyon with the 'skywalk' is a rip off.  This is the least impressive part of the Canyon and they charge a hefty fee to walk out on the glass walk way.  Something like $20 per person.  Ouch!<br>  <br>  Then when you have had enough of the Grand Canyon, usually around dinner time, you can stop at any of the various steakhouses or restaurants along the road for dinner.  You never know what you will find.  My wife and I stopped at a Flea Market and ate at a steakhouse where we had our first experience with fried rattle snake. <br>  <br>  The best value is to do this on a Friday, stay at the Canyon area hotel Friday night and Saturday night then return to Las Vegas.  The Vegas Hotels are usually double the price on Friday and Saturday nights and everything is more crowded on the weekends.  <br>  <br>  Now you can check into your Vegas Hotel and finish out the rest of your week.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  *

8cfvN5voaa	ciao Alex, i've been living in Melbourne for 5 years now. i got my permanent residency by marrying the man of my dreams whom i love very much. I didnt get the permanent residency straight away, i had to wait 3 years and a TON of papers. Very complicated.<br>  I also live in London for 5 years.

Although you can always find a job as a waiter or a barista in another coffee place (we have HEAPS here!!)<br>  <br>  3-thinking about a simple job...is it gonna be difficult to pay the rent,the life and the transport?how much per week a sydney habitant spend for rent,transport and food?<br>  life here is very affordable. especially if your coming with pounds.<br>  <br>  4-clubbing:any gay clubs in sydney?i mean,of course there will be but,the gay life is so big as it is in London? gay life is HUGE in Sydney, is atually the gay capital.

I doubt that he has orders to take a cruise.<br>  <br>  If you are traveling before June 1 you will not need a passport.<br>  <br>  On June 1, 2009 all cruise passengers will be required to possess a passport unless on a closed loop cruise (see below). Prior to that date if you are only traveling to and from Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and Bermuda you only need documentation as indicated in the closed loop rules below. Travel to all other countries requires a passport.<br>  <br>  U.S. citizens on closed-loop cruises (cruises that begin and end at the same port in the U.S.) will be able to enter or depart the country with proof of citizenship, such as a birth certificate and government-issued photo ID. A U.S. citizen under the age of 16 will be able to present either an original or a copy of his or her birth certificate, a Consular Report of Birth Abroad issued by DOS, or a Certificate of Naturalization issued by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.<br>  <br>  Please be aware that you may still be required to present a passport when you dock at a foreign port, depending on the islands or countries that your cruise ship is visiting. Check with your cruiseline to ensure you have the appropriate documents for the stops you’ll be making on your cruise.<br>  <br>  Even though a passport is not required I would highly recommend one.

zEoRcL91aa	What Rio mentioned about the Saxon dialect is true - what you learn in the Volkshochschule and what people speak on the streets will be very different.Don't let that put you off - dialects take time, just learn the basics.<br>  <br>  The best way will be to sign up at a local language school when you arrive and settle down.Also, go to the local library and sign up for the year - it costs 10 euros and you will have a huge resource of language books, cds, dvds etc.<br>  <br>  I learned German for 1 year before moving to Berlin and realized very quickly that people do not speak pedagogic German - they speak fast and sometimes incoherently.

If you know german it is easier for you to learn Chibcha or Suaheli than to learn S?chisisch even in the standard german form. And if you speak german in the standart german for but not in in the form of saxony then you are Wessi like me --- it is better to speak s?chsisch in the form of a texas boy --- then you are straight on their way for s?chsisch people like to travell.<br>  <br>  hello Yvonne, one of my aunts is saxon --- she always speaks to me twice one time s?chsisch pure and one time standart german with the accent of Hannover, where she lived since 1946 (as you know - the best standart german) and so she did since 1949 -- the first time I met her. Why can you book special courses "s?chsisch4you" for foreigners especially germans :-) ???<br>  Standart saxon german is differing from standart german like suaheli from castelliano.<br>  In one point you are right --- Hessian, and Bavarian, cann′t they learn a real language --- for example Hamburger Platt.

896406d7dedb37c4ef791414e98ee7d9aa	Considering that you have a seven months child I would suggest Garda lake, because the water is warmer (Como is a glacial lake, very deep), there are much more beaches and the climate is milder. Furthermore Garda Lake is on the way to Venice, you can catch a train direct to Venice there. There are various boat cruises, small villages all around (don't forget to visit Sirmione and Catullo's vila. Catullo was of the greatest poets of ancient Rome).|`|9ca9e69f5b869bdca6f42bd515a636fcaa	Both are amazing...but I think that lake garda is the less far from Venice!|`|eOBN8BAMaa	Lake Como.  Hey!  You might even run into George Clooney!!|`|WPM0bqyBaa	Lake Garda is more relax and closer to Venice. Lake Como is more upscale and expensive. Lake Como is closer to Torino and Milan.

I just applied for a renewal and it only took them a week!!!  That's incredible though and don't rely on getting it back in a week! I applied early for my renewal as I thought it would take ages. They state 3 weeks on th internet site though!|`|MVVQrEasaa	Pull out your passport - usually kids' passports are only good for 5 years now, so if you haven't been abroad since you were 12 your current passport is probably expired.<br>  <br>  If it is not expired (and has at least 6 months left on it), then good news!  You don't need to do anything passport-wise.  Since you are still technically under age, make sure your parents/guardians have notarized authorizations for you to travel outside of the country.  Many countries require these for kids under 18 who are traveling without both parents.  If there is less than 6 months before it expires, then you need to check if that will be OK for your destination or if you need to get a new passport.<br>  <br>  If your passport is expired, then you'll need to get a new one.  For kids under age 18 (I think), you need to have both parents sign the passport application, usually at the passport office.  There may be ways to have the signatures notarized instead, but frankly it's easier to get both parents to go with you to the passport office instead.  Take your old passport with you as proof of identity and citizenship.<br>  <br>  Full details on what else you need to do and costs etc.  are here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://travel.state.gov/passport/passport_1738_2.html" rel="nofollow">http://travel.state.gov/passport/passpor...</a><br>  <br>  Pay special attention to the instructions for minors aged 16 or 17.  If you are going last minute, you'll also probably need to pay for expedited service.  If your trip is within the next 14 days, you'll have to get an appointment at the closest passport agency, and I hope you live near one of these major cities:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://travel.state.gov/passport/passport_4312.html" rel="nofollow">http://travel.state.gov/passport/passpor...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck and have a good trip!

BRRIyldgaa	You can sponsor your own visa as long as you can prove that you are making enough money to support yourself in Japan.  If a job is only on Saturdays, it probably wouldn`t be enough for you to make the minimum amount required.  My friend who sponsored herself had to document her income from both her mon-fri junior high teaching job as well as the various private teaching gigs she does in the evenings and on weekends.<br>  <br>  There are jobs available working with small children as a full time teacher.  Most of them require at least a bachelor`s degree and experience working with children.  I have a friend who works at an English pre-school/ daycare for very small children. The students in her class are all 1-2 years old, and she interacts with them entirely in English.  Some schools like you to have a visa already, but some will sponsor a visa for you.  They prefer applicants who are already in Japan.<br>  <br>  Here`s a typical job listing for this sort of thing:<br>  <a href="http://www.gaijinpot.com/job_view.php?jid=29673&rid=5&tr=37&cat=&full_part=&position_type=&keyword=&location=210&selang=all&offset=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.gaijinpot.com/job_view.php?ji...</a>|`|5ZtSR0IQaa	In order to work day care or nursery school, you need a license by passing the national certification exam for the respective occupation. You become eligible to take these exams by getting an associates or bachelors degree from an accredited institution. Now, there is a way around this, if there's any day care or nursery school that's looking for an English teacher. But they will prefer someone certified for childcare, and without Japanese certification, you won't be eligible to perform many of the tasks there so your pay will suffer in comparison to the regular staff there.<br>  <br>  There is another way to get around the requirement, by seeking a SOFA job of the same. That means working for the US military, but the catch is that SOFA doesn't technically make you a Japanese resident. If you want to put in 10 years with a Japanese work visa and get permanent residency, that's not possible with SOFA, so that might be a big caveat for some people.<br>  <br>  One of the requirements for a work visa is that the job must pay you enough to live on. In other words, it's not spelled out anywhere, but there is a minimum amount of income required to get the work visa granted. It's very unlikely that a Saturday-only job will meet that minimum income requirement. The threshold is relatively low, though, and most full time jobs will qualify. The exact figure is never published, so it's best to just consult a visa lawyer if you're serious about it.<br>  <br>  It seems like any associates degree from outside Japan will make you eligible to take the certification exam, so re-enrollment may not be necessary if you are literate enough in Japanese to take the exam. Then, it's just a matter of finding an employer, but some public institutions may not hire, as they are government, and government sometimes has rules about employing only nationals. You are right to think church, but most of them will be Buddhist temples, of course.|`|3xwFPL4naa	A work visa must be sponsored by a Japanese employer.  It's not a question of "Does this job qualify for a work visa," rather, it's a question of "Are there any employers in Japan who would sponsor a visa and hire me for this kind of work?"  At the present time, the answer is no.  There are too many unemployed Japanese people who are qualified for these jobs.  Jobs will always go to a native Japanese first because its much cheaper and more convenient to hire a native than to sponsor a visa for a foreigner.<br>  <br>  Even if someone wanted to hire you, you need a Bachelor's degree, period.  This is a requirement set by the Japanese government and there's no way around it.  Further, to work with children you need to be certified by a Japanese agency.  That's hard to do even if you speak fluent Japanese.<br>  <br>  P.S. The first guy's answer made perfect sense to me.  If you couldn't understand his vocabulary then I don't think you're cut out to be an English teacher.|`|e7576a139b6789e59e2195c707b6c228aa	No, you don't a degree to work with kids-but you do need the degree to obtain a specialist in humanities and international affairs visa. If you had a pre-college or cultural visa, etc. you could work up to 20 hours a week-but it's unlikely that anyone would get fussy about the 20 hours as long as you maintained whatever it was your visa was supposed to be for in the first place.|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	Jettoblack is right, again....You need a work visa to work in Japan.The employer sponsors the employee.This costs them money.And no one is going to do it for a part-time job.

ba698d8451b8206312f913a19450f500aa	You're not going to be able to have the best apartment, but you definitely could have a decent lifestyle.<br>  <br>  Rent can be quite high in the city, depending on where you live of course. You'll probably have to pay utilities too. You could definitely get a nice studio or a small apartment. You can also look into getting a roommate, of course that cuts costs and to some extent you have less worrying about stuff. Rent can be anywhere from $1000 to $3000 on average, but I know $3000 is a decent 2-3 bedroom remodeled apartment you probably don't need. You can also probably get an apartment cheaper because you don't need a garage and that cuts costs.<br>  <br>  We'll average $2400 for a single-person apartment with paid utilities.<br>  <br>  A bus pass in SF for adults for the Muni underground and street buses is $45, unless they raised the prices again. You can also consider City CarShare, but I don't think it's very reasonable in the long run. Muni is pretty good to me, so I would highly recommend using it. Taxis seem to be nonexistent in the city unless you call one, so keep that in mind.<br>  <br>  You're at $2445.<br>  <br>  You'll find the nightlife in the city is totally there - great places to go, and usually not that expensive. Food can also be super cheap in a city like this. Venture into a Chinese restaurant and you can get a huge plate of food for $5. Cuisine is definitely one of the best things San Francisco has to offer, with three-course French meals for $30 to the said Chinese food for $5. Also home to the finest restaurants in the world!|`|d0d7b35a707f98e4d94fb32cc3b60b5baa	Cost of living in Frisco is near the highest in California.|`|AA10758468	Pretty good actually. The major cost of living in the Bay Area is housing. If you only have to pay property tax and maintenance and not a mortgage that frees up a lot of money. I loathe public transportation in San Francisco but a lot of people are quite content with it. Not having a car could potentially lower the cost of living but if you own a house or condo and it comes with parking it could be a wash as far as the costs of owning and maintaining a car and using public transportation. On the other hand, without a car you have a much lower lifestyle.|`|gxkG1Gbyaa	I would say average, because San Francisco is a place to consider rental property.  If you want to own, consider Pacific Beach, San Diego.<br>  <br>  Check out Bert Sperling's 'Best Places to Live' on the Web.

utbfT0APaa	Hey Matewan, ever heard of Buckhannon??<br>  The town was named after Matteawan (now called Beacon), a town in Dutchess County, Upstate New York. Matteawan was the home town of Erskine Hazard, a civil engineer from the Norfolk and Western Railway who laid out the town in 1890 and drew up the first map of the new community. Local residents, however, changed the spelling and pronunciation.[1]<br>  <br>  Attempts to unionize by coal miners in 1920 led to the Battle of Matewan between miners and Baldwin-Felts detectives, which was the inspiration for the 1987 movie Matewan.<br>  <br>  The town's history is on display at the town's Web site, which has a small museum.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Attractions<br>  Because of its rich history (Hatfield-McCoy feud and Matewan Massacre), the center of the town was designated the Matewan Historic District, a National Historic Landmark. Interesting sights and tours can be had while visiting the town.<br>  <br>  The Hatfield-McCoy Trails opened a trail head in Matewan. Trail Riders can now easily access the trail system while staying in town.|`|b8e17f565936253241a343443917ca6baa	I have a movie at home called Matewan about the mining conflicts in the area, but I haven't had a chance to watch it.  I would venture to say that if there's been a movie made about an event(s) that happened in your town, there is some level of historic significance to it.  (Every town is historic in its own way!)|`|16f786290d793ae0cfafb186615cca8daa	I used to live in Williamson for a couple years growing up, when they were filming the movie "Matewan," and what sticks out in my mind is the historical significance of the area, as well as how beautiful it is there and how friendly the people are. :)|`|Tp795k5taa	OoOo I know I know!!! That is where the Hatfield-McCoy feud took place.
dpKntiZoaa	To be honest, the best way to find an apartment (decent area for a decent price is word-of-mouth with a personal network), but of course not everyone will have this.<br>  <br>  Therefore there are sites, but I would honestly advise you not to stick to just English ones as you will lose a large portion of the market - especially the more reasonably priced ones.  You can always paste the URL in Google translate and it will translate it (not well but good enough to understand)<br>  <br>  Another point is depending on how long you want to stay and if you know Amsterdam well enough.  You may well struggle to find an apartment for 1 year or less without employing the services of an agency (expensive, but at least you can be sure that it will be in a decent area if you request it, otherwise you could end up anywhere if you do not know the place)<br>  <br>  It is expensive whatever you want (relative to the size), but of course depends if you want an apartment to yourself or if you are prepared to share a house (with a bedroom for yourself and shared kitchen/bathroom). <br>  <br>  Also take care for "cheap" prices - there is bound to be a catch e.g. dodgey area<br>  <br>  Here are some links for your to search for an accomodation yourself<br>  <a href="http://www.amsterdam.info/apartments/" rel="nofollow">http://www.amsterdam.info/apartments/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.directwonen.nl/zoeken/woonruimte/haarlem.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.directwonen.nl/zoeken/woonrui...</a> (Dutch) or <a href="http://www.directliving.nl/" rel="nofollow">http://www.directliving.nl/</a> (English)<br>  <a href="http://www.funda.nl/WoningAanbod/Huur/Default.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.funda.nl/WoningAanbod/Huur/De...</a> (Dutch, fill in Amsterdam in "Locatie" and press "Zoeken" to find available rental places)<br>  Huur is "rent" Then on the right hand side click the options:<br>  - "Gemeubileerd" which means furnished<br>  - "Appartement"- meaning apartment (of course!)<br>  - "Aantal kamers" means how many rooms which you can choose if you want<br>  - "Woonoppervlakte"- means living space in square meters<br>  <a href="http://www.kamernet.nl/" rel="nofollow">http://www.kamernet.nl/</a> (Dutch)<br>  <a href="http://www.expatica.com/nl/listings/deta..." rel="nofollow">http://www.expatica.com/nl/listings/deta...</a> - Expat site in English<br>  <br>  Private ads<br>  <a href="http://www.viavia.nl/" rel="nofollow">http://www.viavia.nl/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.marktplaats.nl/" rel="nofollow">http://www.marktplaats.nl/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.speurders.nl/" rel="nofollow">http://www.speurders.nl/</a><br>  <br>  You can also check out agencies.

When we moved over here we actually took a temporary apartment for month (use craigs list to fine one.  you'll get a much better deal).  During that month, we hooked up with a realtor who showed us around.  Most of the properties he took us to were listed on these websites.  I definitely think it's important to see a place before you commit.  The pictures can be very deceiving and there were places that looked great on the web but were horrible in person.  <br>  Also Te Huur = To Rent and Te Koop = For Sale

QpwSpnu7aa	Since you have already stayed at the Animal Kingdom Lodge and the Wilderness Lodge (my favorite) I will assume you know these two well.

168e1ad6c1f54e307a02551c3b7c8caeaa	I live in Tampa and the safest areas to stay in are not really "commercial", they're residential and nearby are a few, if not more than some businesses...but if you want to feel at home but avoid crowds from "all over the globe", pick a hotel that is not near any tourist attractions (i.e. Busch Gardens area, Downtown, Ybor/ Channelside, Airport/Westshore, nearby Beaches);<br>  <br>  <br>  If you can afford it splurge on a resort near Davis Island (or Harbor)...that would be ideal.

The government does not have to make up stories about the violence in Mexico as it is happening.  The drug cartels are fighting amongst themselves and they don't care who gets caught in the crossfire.  The major tourist areas are some of the worst for the drug wars but in particular Tijuana, Nuevo Loredo and Nogalas.  Cancun and parts of Baja are also involved with this on going problem.

V7lGsaR8aa	Do as the previous answerer says , then check out priceline.com they do some great packages .|`|urHPuzMsaa	Not really. You just have to keep checking as specials are offered on a daily basis. The travel sites will get special offers from the hotels and they then pass along to you. Just keep going from site to site and include http:/www.sidestep.com as they check all the sites for the best prices and they don't charge a fee.|`|zqEBmLeuaa	Right now is really too early to be looking.  You need to wait until about 3 months before you go to start and compare prices, but you will have until 1 month before your trip to find the best prices, so be patient and look for the best deal.  <br>  <br>  Right now Southwest is not showing their flights for October and November, and any other airline that has those available are going to charge you a lot right now.  But in about July or August, start looking at Southwest and Airtran.  Sign up for their email alerts so that you are alerted when they have $99 sales or $59 sales.  Southwest ran a special earlier this year where all flights to Vegas were half price.<br>  <br>  For a hotel, you might want to wait on that also to find the best deal.  I always use this website when booking my Vegas hotel because you can't find better deals anywhere.  They compile all of the offers that the hotels have in effect so that you can use them.  You might find some deals for October right now, but the better ones will come in about August-September.  <a href="http://www.smartervegas.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.smartervegas.com/</a><br>  <br>  I have never had much luck finding package deals, in my experience it has ALWAYS been cheaper to book separately and book directly, no third party vendors!  The only package deal that has come close to a good price has been through <a href="http://www.southwestvacations.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.southwestvacations.com/</a><br>  <br>  You are so lucky to be able to go for that long.  When we go, we usually do a Sunday-Thursday trip.  But we are going to be out there in mid October.|`|j7vfbwVUaa	The best way to get a great deal is to book them separately. For flights, check sites like Southwest airlines or US Airways. Also do a search on kayak engine. It will check all airlines going to Vegas and all major travel sites and return the cheapest fare. <a href="http://www.lasvegas-how-to.com/cheap-flights.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.lasvegas-how-to.com/cheap-fli...</a><br>  <br>  For hotels, book directly from the hotels using their discount promo codes to get the maximum discounts. Here are a few codes. <a href="http://www.lasvegas-how-to.com/special.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.lasvegas-how-to.com/special.p...</a>|`|aW10tHTnaa	Depending where you are coming from Southwest usually has the cheapest flights for our area and they do not have them on any of the flight search engines.  <br>  <br>  Airfarewatchdog has lots of good flight deals and smartervegas.com lists the hotel promotion codes which are often GREAT deals.|`|DKfScL8taa	I just booked my package about two weeks ago, we leave this saturday. I was searching and searching for about two weeks prior to that trying to find a great deal, and waiting for my tax returns to come back. After HOURS of surfing the web, I ALWAYS found the best deal at expedia.com|`|700c94a067fa40af4b92ab4a9fe433f5aa	Usually, I reccomend SWAirlinesvacations.com...They have always had the best prices in the past, if you are anywhere that they fly from, and have direct flights.....but their prices for Fall will not be available until after April 7th...so you'll have to wait for prices!  However, since I am using my Tax Refund to book this year, and do not want to wait, and have been comparison shopping for some time...I opted for USAirvacations.com...found a great deal for September...flight and room for 3 nights less than I can fly SW at this time...We stay "Downtown on Fremont Street"  and 2 tickets and room for 3 nights for 2 was less than $575 at the nicest hotel on Fremont Street!<br>  Found some pretty fair deals on rooms, but could not beat this price anywhere on line! Going with my best friend, and we split the cost...I wrote a check for $267.00...That is for Roundtrip flight and 3 nights-4 days... Flying out of Albuquerque at 8:40am and in Vegas at 11:15am...with one stop...flight out a little longer...leaving at 1:05, and back in Abq @5:42pm...giving up that direct flight is hard, but the savings by loooking at current prices was almost $200...checked all your sites and the closest was about $860....so saving over $300 thru US AIR!  Good Luck!  I have always found better deals thru the Airlines Vacations than thru any of the big travel companies...and also better flight plans!  We always fly mid week and this time, we are not staying on a night during the weekend....whole trip will be mid-week!  You will always save money if you schedule mid-week and no holiday...it also seems to me that about 3pm on Friday the machines tighten up anyway....and we have always left on Saturday Afternoons, previously!|`|16f786290d793ae0cfafb186615cca8daa	Keep checking with those sites, as well as individual companies, airlines, hotels, etc, to see which offers the best price or package deal. Sometimes a separate promo deal will beat out Expedia or Orbits.|`|Aesq1I4Baa	The best is to book air and hotel seperately in order to get the best price. For air I would check kayak.com e.g. and for hotel rooms I recommend to keep an eye on <a href="http://www.vegas-hotels-online.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.vegas-hotels-online.com</a> - it has the latest Las Vegas hotel promotion codes.|`|vzDzyRonaa	Check allegaintair.com.  They always have great specials and fly out of alot of places.
ejujoezgaa	Little Round Top is my favorite location in the park, both as it was the site of one of the critical conflicts in the battle, but also because it offers a great view of the entire battlefield and a visitor can understand how Union artillery on that hill was able to influence greatly the final outcome of the battle.<br>  <br>  While there, ponder the stories of those who gave their lives to save the Union at that brief moment of time:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.vincent.goellnitz.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.vincent.goellnitz.org/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.brotherswar.com/Gettysburg-2q.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.brotherswar.com/Gettysburg-2q...</a><br>  <br>  The first thing you should do, however, is go to the new Visitors' Center:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nps.gov/gett/planyourvisit/visitorcenters.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nps.gov/gett/planyourvisit/vi...</a><br>  <br>  If you have the time, consider a podcast-guided or ranger-guided tour:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nps.gov/gett/planyourvisit/things2do.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nps.gov/gett/planyourvisit/th...</a><br>  <br>  Commercial tours also are available:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gettysburgtourguides.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gettysburgtourguides.org/</a><br>  <br>  I don't know if you're going with kids or not, but kids especially appreciate the boulders of the Devil's Den.  Other key battle locations are Seminary Ridge and the High Water Mark.<br>  <br>  I would suggest before going, you make an effort to see the movie, "Gettysburg."  Remember as you watch it, that Pickett's charge involved many more men than depicted in the movie.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107007/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107007/</a><br>  <br>  The movie was based on the "Killer Angels," a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Michael Schaara.  Reading this book and a history of the battle would certainly be rewarded by a greater understanding of the battle once you reach the national park.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nps.gov/gett/historyculture/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nps.gov/gett/historyculture/i...</a><br>    <br>  If you're coming from a distance, consider visiting Antietam as well.  It is a more compact battlefield.  The one-day battle at Antietam was the bloodiest single day in American history.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nps.gov/anti/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nps.gov/anti/</a>|`|b8e17f565936253241a343443917ca6baa	You might want to rent or buy an audio tour CD, which will give you a narrated driving tour of the different parts of the battlefield.  It will at least give you a place to start and if you get to one part of the battlefield that you really want to explore (like Devils Den or Little Round Top), then you could scrap the audio tour and explore on your own (it's a lot to do in one day).  You should definitely leave some time to walk around some of the shops downtown too.  I haven't seen the new visitor's center yet, but I'm sure it's amazing.<br>  <br>  I would definitely recommend reading "The Killer Angels" ahead of time too.  It's a great book, even if you're not a big Civil War buff.

fM7CwTwzaa	Outstanding idea!  <br>  <br>  Sounds like you already have done some homework and know about some of the good options for day trips or weekend jaunts from Cuernavaca. It's roughly 1 hour by bus from Cuernavaca to the Taxquena bus station in Mexico City (aka, Autobuses del Sur). From there, you can Metro to Coyoacan for the Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo experience (check out the Leon Trotsky museum there too....fascinating stuff!) Take the Metro to Autobuses del Norte if you want to catch the bus to Teotihuacan (which might well fill most or all of a day).<br>  <br>  I'd also do some other stuff in downtown Mexico City. The Templo Mayor is spectacular as is Chapultepec Castle and the Anthropology Museum. <br>  <br>  As for doing a trip somewhere safe and culturally rich, I'd seriously consider Oaxaca: especially if you could wrangle some kind of cooking class or gourmet tour because the food and drink in Oaxaca are a constant orgasm for your palate. Some of the world's top celebrity chefs learned their craft in Oaxaca (like Rick Bayless in the U.S. or Marta Ortiz in Mexico). Oaxaca is home to Monte Alban and other archaeological sites from the Zapotec culture, and it also boasts colonial architecture, arts museums (Oaxaca was home of Rufino Tamayo), and a very unique vibe.<br>  <br>  I like Morelia too (with easy trips to Patzcuaro and Janitzio), as well as Merida. These areas are increasingly accessible with all the low-cost airlines doing affordable short haul trips (look at volaris.com.mx, interjet.com.mx, aviacsa.com, and vivaaerobus.com --- remember that the Toluca airport (TLC) could be an option for you if you're not finding good fares via Mexico City (MEX). <br>  <br>  There are also numerous colonial cities in the Bajio highland region to the north of Mexico City. Many American retirees love San Miguel de Allende, though in my opinion, Guanajuato is one of the loveliest and most fascinating of these colonial gems.|`|1d3e58ddc48d93186e5cebea8662a948aa	Tepoztlan is very near Cuernavaca and it is a nice little town, touristy but still has a lot of local flavor. You can go back and forth in a single day. Mexico City is also very near, just need to be careful and plan your itinerary there ahead of time.<br>  You can also take a bus from Cuernavaca to Puebla, a beautiful colonial city. And yes, try to travel along with a friend.|`|AA12244948	I've only been to Mexico City, Monterrey and Pachua so I can't suggest other places to visit but do be very careful. Are you sure you don't want to travel with a friend? Be aware of everything around you at all times.|`|DC4Civrvaa	in teotihuacan you can see the pyramids.  They are beautiful.  Make sure to climb to the very top.  The "luna" pyramid is smaller than the "sol" pyramid and easier to get up to.  The view is beautiful from the top.|`|7JU853bzaa	Go to Yucatan it is really nice and is really far from the border, you will found beaches and piramid|`|p1yIVINraa	Cancun and other popular cities on the Gulf Coast are always safe to travel to; as usually is the capitol as long as you stay in well lit, populous areas. The Capitol also has really great murals in the subway and art all over left over from when the Olympics was there.<br>  <br>  However, doing so alone whether male or female is a poor idea; just because then there's no one to check in with you to make sure that you're alright, and to see that no one drops something in your drink when you're not looking.  See if someone else from your study group wants to travel longer, and join up with you.<br>  <br>  And don't let what a lot of people say about Mexico being exceptionally dangerous now distract you from your trip.  If things got as bad as the media is making them into your school (either in the US or Mexico) would cancel the trip.  Though things in Mexico are turgent right now, you need only be as cautious as you would be going into a large city in the US like New York, Boston, or Los Angeles.  <br>  <br>  Oh, and enjoy the Kahlo museum, I've heard it's fabulous!|`|N3OTgFs1aa	With what is going on right now in Mexico i don't recommend going anywhere alone.

It′s way better to eat out and experience the real mexico in stead of eating hot dogs and pizza in the hotel snack bar. <br>  <br>  partying depends as well, you can get an open bar for about 30 dlls, or if you want a bottle it would be around 1000 pesos... it all depends on what kind of experience you want..<br>  <br>  A cab from the hotel zone to downtown is about 10 dlls... If you are downtown and want to go somewhere else downtown, pay no more tan 35 pesos (about 2dlls)<br>  <br>  You MUST go to a cenote one day... you will probably spend about less than 100 dlls for and all day experience. It′s totally worth it.<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|fNwgiSFYaa	I'll break it down for you since you are getting useless info.<br>  Since you are going for spring break you probably won't be worried about food much. You will find the same things in Cancun as you do back home.  You can go to McDonald's, Burger King, order Dominoes or Pizza Hut pizza, etc..  Of course if you want nice dinners there are those nice restaurants as well.  They even have chain restaurants like T.G.I.F., Chilis, and Hooters to name a few.<br>  Drinks can be pricey, but since it's spring break all the bars/clubs will have deals on drinks.<br>  Some of the clubs can be pricey.  Coco Bongo's alone on the weekends is $60 just to get in.  Some clubs are cheaper at around $40.  Like I mentioned it's hard to say because it's spring break and they will have drink specials and admissions.<br>  Just estimating though you will probably go through about $100 a day if not more.<br>  Remember.... ALWAYS book all-inclusive.  It's cheaper in the long run.|`|ddTO08ppaa	A lot of bars will be a buck or two a beer.  Don't get mixed drinks because the ice will get you sick.  Or ask for no ice.

However, such a place just doesn’t exist; the two terms are mutually exclusive. It's all about supply and demand: If it's in SoCal, then it's not going to be cheap to begin with. If it's a safe area, then it's more expensive. If you need good schools, add a couple hundred bucks a month on top of it.<br>  <br>  If you want to live here and enjoy the weather, then you have to pay for it. You put up with the smog and the traffic, enjoy the weather and pay your rent or mortgage. My advice is to start checking out craigslist, rent.com, and apartments.com if you are looking to rent. You’ll quickly see that the minimum rent for a non-war zone is about $1,000-$1,200 per month for a studio or 1BR. Really nice areas (like the West LA area) easily run $3,000 or more. Want to live near the beach? Expect to pay a premium. <br>  <br>  "LA" is such a big place, there are so many neighborhoods/cities where you can live. Of course, even within a city or neighborhood, there are safer sections and less-safe sections.<br>  In Los Angeles, some nice sections are West LA, Brentwood, Westwood, Bel Air, Marina Del Rey, Playa Del Rey, Los Feliz, Silverlake, Eagle Rock, Encino, Tarzana, Studio City, Toluca Lake, Granada Hills, Woodland Hills, Sherman Oaks, West Hills, Chatsworth. Beverly Hills and West Hollywood are surrounded by LA, but are incorporated cities with their own police, FD, etc.<br>  <br>  To the east: South Pasadena, parts of Pasadena, Altadena, Arcadia, Monrovia, Glendora, San Dimas, Laverne, Azusa, Rancho Cucamonga.

b8e17f565936253241a343443917ca6baa	If it were me, I'd get a nice tent and stay at campgrounds and state parks rather than hotels.  Would probably be a much more enriching experience and it'd be a lot cheaper.  I'd bring a cooler and stop at grocery stores to resupply with food and drinks too - would save you some money over eating out all the time.<br>  <br>  I've never really used travelers checks, but you might want to look into that.  I'd also call a few hotels and see if there is a minimum age for renting a room.

Most of the KOA campgrounds have pools and free wifi too.<br>  <br>  If you have a debit card that is very helpful for buying gas and food.

78c8fa42f10a6b4d6fa9d689c34f530daa	Shenzhen and Guangzhou are both part of China.  The quick answer is that once you are inside China (which does require a visa), you do not need any additional permit to travel in between these two cities.  You can travel between them as often as you like.  A high speed train leaves every fifteen minutes from the East train station in Guangzhou, takes about an hour, and will cost you about 60 RMB each way.  (For that matter, once you are inside China, you can travel almost any place inside the country.)  <br>  <br>  The designation "Special Economic Zone" is kind of like a designation of a "business district" with special taxing rules designed to encourage development, it is not a designation about a border.  (At one time, a long time ago, businessmen could get a special visa from Hong Kong just to visit Shenzhen, but those days are past.)    <br>  <br>  However, both cities are very close to Hong Kong.  Your visa is worth talking about in the context of Hong Kong, because you do have to go through passport control to get into Hong Kong from China.  An American citizen does not need a visa to get into Hong Kong, but you would need a visa entry for each and every time you enter China from Hong Kong. <br>  <br>  I hope you will visit Hong Kong while you are in China, because it's a great city with a lot to see and do.  Some mainland Chinese will tell you that Hong Kong is nothing special, but that's not true!  It's definitely worth making time to see.  If you leave China to visit Hong Kong, then getting back into China after that visit does require another visa entry.  Plenty of people have gone to visit Hong Kong during their trip to China and then found that they couldn't get back into China without waiting for a new China visa!    <br>  <br>  If you haven't yet applied for your visa, you should apply for at least a double entry.  It's just a matter of which box you check on the visa application.  Even if you don't plan to use the extra entry (assuming you apply for a double entry), it's nice to have the option of leaving the country and coming back again.  If you have already obtained your visa, you can look at what was issued to see how many visa entries you have.  Typically, a tourist visa is either one or two entries, and a business visa will be either one, two, or multiple entries, but in order to know you have to look at it.  <br>  <br>  If it happens that you only have one entry and you would like to see Hong Kong, generally it is very easy to get a new visa while you are in Hong Kong, but it will take a visa agent one full day to get it for you.  What you would do in that event is take the train to Hong Kong, then after you arrive at the train station you give your passport and visa application to a travel agent at one of the agencies inside the train station.  You would then pick up your passport from them after you return for your train ride back into China.  However, don't leave China without talking to a travel agency ahead of time to make sure you could get back into the country.  As long as you are not working illegally, it shouldn't be a problem but last year it became significantly more difficult to obtain a visa while in Hong Kong and some tourists were turned away from China during the Olympics.  I even heard of one French tour group that had their complete itinerary booked and were planning to get their China visas in Macau, and their visas were denied (this was right after the Olympic torch went through Paris and the Chinese girl was the subject of French protests).  The visa agents in Guangzhou and Shenzhen will know if there would be any problem getting a visa.  Once you are in China on your last entry, don't leave the country again (if you want to come back), unless you have some reassurance from a visa agent that you could indeed get a new visa issued.  <br>  <br>  Macau is another destination that ought not to be overlooked.  From Macau, you can also fly very cheaply to other places such as Manilla or Bangkok.  ...  Think about it!  <br>  <br>  Have a great trip!|`|AA12026078	No Shenzhen is part of China. You don't need any visa to enter it unless your coming from the Hong Kong side. But as you already got a Chinese visa you don't need to get another one.|`|Lmw6dtQvaa	Your VISA is good For Shenzhen.

ipw5zYZYaa	It depends on what you are mailing, how you are mailing it, where in China it is coming from and where in the US it is going to.  I live in northwest China and I repeatedly mail things to the States.  A 30-pound box made it to Boston in a week using air mail.  A one-pound padded envelope took six weeks to get to California using surface mail.  A one-pound padded envelope to France took four weeks using air mail. <br>  <br>  Registered mail can sometimes go faster, but it is much more expensive. <br>  <br>  Additionally, the backlog at the customs entry point in the US can slow things down as well.  Everything that enters the US must go through a scanning system, random drug check, etc. <br>  <br>  Postage from China to the US has increased significantly over the years.  It used to be quite inexpensive, but now is quite pricey.  I'd give a link to the rates, but it's all in Chinese!

PA0bGBtCaa	Ask the airline when you check in if you can be made a "meet and assist." They will still treat you as an adult, and you won't have to pay the UNMR fee, but there will be someone in LAS to escort you to the baggage claim level. Just tell them you're unfamiliar with the procedures and you're flying alone. They will take care of you.|`|f6e183807bb2af441e3f39a47f042926aa	hey, I flew alone, and I just turned sixteen, only a few days ago (Friday). I flew home yesterday. It's not too bad, but PLEASE do not check any bags if you can help it. Take all of your stuff in a carry-on because they lost my bag and I'm freaking out that I'll never find it. I'm absolutely terrified, because I had something very sentimental to me in the bag. I hope I have saved you the trouble.<br>  <br>  carry ons cant usually be over 22 inches.|`|1bTYCUDkaa	Have no fear! The airport is a simple place. First, you should leave to the airport around 2 and a half hours before your flight if you are traveling within the US, and if you are going internationally, leave 3 hours before your departure time. You will pull up on to the ramp, and you will see signs that will have the names of airlines on them, for example, Southwest Airlines, Delta Airlines, America West, Virgin America, and so on. Stop at the sign that has your airline listed on it. Walk inside with all of your luggage. Walk to the desk, and you will be told what to do by the agent. Give them all of the luggage you want to not carry-on to the plane. He or she will then give you are boarding pass, if you have not yet printed it online, and some baggage receipts, just in case your bags get lost. Then, proceed to the TSA Security, with your carry-on bag. Give the TSA Agent your ID and Boarding pass. They will sign the boarding pass, and give you both items back. They will tell you which line to go to. Put your carry-on bag into the X-ray, and remove your shoes, jacket, and any metal devices including a cell phone, rings, ear rings, belts, etc. Put them in a bin. Then, put them into the X-ray as well. A TSA Agent will tell you to walk under a metal detector X-ray. It will beep if you still have metal on you. If no metal is on you, you will be free to go. Retrieve your items at the end of the X-ray. Walk to your gate. For example, if your gate is B19, walk towards the sign that says, "To B Gates", or whatever your gate number is. Sit down, and wait until boarding. Boarding will be explained to the passengers before entering.<br>  <br>  Once you get to your destination airport, walk towards the sign that says, "Baggage Claim"; follow the other passengers if you are not sure where to go. There will be a carousel, and then once you see your bag(s), pull them off. Remember, it may take 10-20 minutes for bags to begin to arrive. Walk outside, and wait for the person picking you up. Good luck, and email me if you have any more questions.

lQB9gMEqaa	Fort Lauderdale is safe, and tame, and not any thing like it was 20 years ago when it was wild.  Now it's very very tame. <br>  <br>  Most teens in this town do their own parties because at 17 you cant get into most of the bars.  The exception is the ones that are restaurants and bars where food is the main deal.<br>  <br>  If you are young, get up early and go to the beach in the mornings. It often clouds over in the afternoons.  Be bold and wear a thong swimsuit.  That's about the most fun you will have all day.  <br>  <br>  I also suggest renting or buying a bicycle becuase Fort Lauderdale is flat and a bike is a good way to get around.  YOU MUST HAVE A LOCK AND CABLE.  You can rent or borrow a bicycle or if you are staying more than a couple of days it may make sense to purchse a used bicycle or cheep $75 walmart bike and then sell it on to someone else on the last day.<br>  <br>  If you want to do something exciting and have the money then take kite surfing lessons.  <br>  <br>  At 17 you will find the real party is the beach during the day, and then private parties or just going out to eat at night.  Try eating at the QuaterDeck, two blocks back from the beach on Las Olas.  You won't be able to drink, but you can hang out and eat and have a good time.<br>  <br>  Also go window shopping on Las Olas.  Everything stays open late on Friday and Saturday nights.  Then walk on to Riverside and then Himmershie Village where the bars and clubs are.  The Village is only jumping on Friday and Saturday nights because it is mainly locals.  (Just over the rail lines behind RiverSide).|`|A1wN5SHZaa	Ft. Lauderdale is a really busy city.. with tons of people.

But, from JFK to MCO for one-adult, round-trip, on May 20 to May 27, with taxes, is $186.19 with Delta Airlines, non-stop.  Leaving from Long Island with Southwest Airlines on May 20 to May 27 for the same itinerary is $209.80.|`|mxNxiMO6aa	It depends when exactly you want to go... since you have a wide range, you can find something cheap. I am going to give you the only piece of advice that was given to me for finding cheap travel deals, and it works to this day... Compare as many travel websites as you can as often as you can. Since you have a few months, start searching today and search the flights or hotels or whatever you need every week until the month before you are going. If anything is unusually cheaper, book it on that date. I would definitely recommend checking out the website BookMe. You can compare ALL the reputable travel sites from one location, and save tons of money. Good luck and check out the link below, and you will be all set.

If you need to take more than one travel size contact solution it's ok as long as it all fits into that ziplock bag. Everything else can go in your carry on bag.|`|f6e183807bb2af441e3f39a47f042926aa	You can take on all of that I think as long as the perfume and contact solution are under 3.5 ounces.|`|e6Kbb3H9aa	Your items are ok for carry if your liquids are 3oz.

FNOLdEh0aa	I sent mine off on the 29th January and still havent heard back from them but they have took the money out of the account. Is it your first UK passport and are you over 16? Because you will need an interview (like me) which slows the process of the application.. Sorry but dont think you will recieve it in time if it is your first passport :(. Hoped I helped :D x
kgBPU4xxaa	Three days isn't enough time for the Amalfi Coast if you're going to Venice from Zurich in three days by train. It's over 10 hours just to get from Zurich to Naples, then you need to hop on the Circumvesuviana train to get to Sorrento. From there, it's a bus or boat to go further along the coast. Naples to Venice is another 6.5 hr trip.<br>  <br>  Zurich is a nice place to spend a day. From there you could take the train to Verona via Milan pretty easily. A day in Verona and a day around Garda Lake is a good choice if you haven't been there before. <br>  <br>  Alternatively, you could take the train from Zurich to Munich. If you do that, you can easily go to Fussen on the train and see Neuschwanstein & Hohenschwangau Castles for a day, spend a day in Munich itself and catch the train to Venice from there.<br>  <br>  You are probably better off just buying individual tickets rather than getting a Eurail pass, especially if you book the individual tickets in advance. There's a discounted fare from Zurich to Munich for only 39 euro, for example, but the discounted rates tend to sell out fairly quickly. You would have to pay an extra supplement on the train with a Eurail pass. Most of the faster trains require an extra fee when you have a Eurail pass and you may need to have a prebooked reservation for some of the trains anyway. The Eurail pass only functions as a hop-on, hop-off option when you use the slower regional trains that may require a number of train changes to travel long distances.|`|2bVxBCgzaa	the Amalfi Coasy it amazing- stay in Sorrento ( a terrific little city) and you'll have easy access to Pompeii the Amalfi, and Capri, and it's just ooutside of Naples, so you have all the train connections you need to Venice. You could also go to the Cinque Terra, my vote for the most beautiful part of Europe, and it's pretty close to Venice (it's near Genoa). For something a bit different, consider Ljubljana and Lake Bled in Slovenia- just across the border from Venice; absolutely gorgeous and little-visited. There used to be a direct train to Venice from LJ, but you might simply have to transfer. And everyone speaks great English in Slovenia, so it's easy to spend a couple of days.
